I wouldn't mind the puzzles in Cogs—they're simple and challenging and satisfying to solve—but when you time it, it takes ALL the fun out of it for me and it's just an anxiety trip. Although I loved the mode where you have to solve the puzzles with a turn limit and no time limit, you have to unlock them first, so that was frustrating.\n\nHowever I must mention that the sound design for this game is really, really well-done. It makes the whole thing feel very snappy and responsive.","November 25, 2013","false","1.0"," 45 of 61 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","45","61","0","2"

WAIT, COME BACK HERE! It's also surprisingly fun and relatively varied.\n\nSliding puzzles are considered tedious because the aim usually is to reconstruct a picture, or a sequence of numbers, meaning every piece has to be at its exact place, and that may cause frustration. But here, you have to align cogs and pipes, and some of the tiles are definitely inter-changeable (with few exception a cog is the same as another cog), so that problem is considerably lowered in most puzzles. Variety comes from the shapes of the boards, the types of cogs or pipes present, the kind of contraption ultimately activated by all those trinkets, double faced boards, bells to ring... Cogs is quite effective at keeping your interest alive. And it must be, because the puzzles are clearly challenging.\n\nAnother nice touch, is that each of the 50 puzzles also has two variants, much shorter and easier but with additional constraints (one must be completed in less than 30 seconds, the other in less than 10 moves).\n\nThere isn't a story, even though there definitely is a Steampunk meets Da Vinci's codex theme.\n\nMusic is forgettable, graphics are nice and clean, but unspectacular. Also, it's a bit disappointing when a 2009 game forces you into a 4:3 screen ratio.\n\nOverall, the puzzle difficulty lied just within my fun zone and the game's uniqueness makes it hard to not recommend to puzzle enthusiasts.","March 14, 2014","true","11.0"," 18 of 21 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","18","21","0","0"

Every puzzle consists of moving tiles around while trying to complete different objectives.  It's difficult at times to wrap your head around the puzzles presented, but that just goes to show you that although amiable and pleasant, this is a serious puzzle game.\nCogs is well polished and fun, but the puzzles were a bit too difficult for me.  I got discouraged from continuing and decided to move on to other games in my collection.  The similarity of all the tile puzzles can also begin to wear on you, but overall the level of polish brought with Cogs, the difficulty of the puzzles, and the charming aspects of its aesthetics (even the optional "cute" text) are enough to garner a recommendation from me.

However, looking at this in comparison to other puzzle games, it's just not quite as fun. The sliding puzzle mechanic is just unpleasant to interact with. Unlike some better puzzle games where the puzzles are about experimenting and discovering properties about each puzzle and having flashes of insight, these puzzles just feel like they're about sliding stuff around and remembering the patterns of moves you need to make to achieve a certain desired state. Particularly when you need to try to beat levels in a short time or with few moves, the game becomes entirely about memorization, which isn't a fun mechanic to people who like puzzle games, usually. It's not easy to describe, really, but the primary sliding block mechanics of this game just aren't fun to deal with unless you really like this particular sort of thing, and I'm a huge fan of puzzle games. As the levels get harder, you basically get into situations where you've come close to the final solution state for a given sliding puzzle, but in order to get a piece in place you need to temporarily "un-make" the solution to give yourself the mobility to get the final piece in place - so to do this well you just need to memorize the pattern of moves you need to do to get the final piece in place and to re-make the already solved part. I don't find this very fun, I find it more mentally exhausting than intellectually stimulating.\n\nAgain, if you like this sort of aesthetic or puzzle mechanic, you'll probably like this. Otherwise, if you're just looking for an all around fun game, probably skip this.","November 12, 2014","false","1.1"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","0"

The puzzles are of the sort where you slide interlocking tiles around on a board. You probably played with a puzzle like this when you were a child, one with tiles numbered 1 through 15, and you worked to get the numbers in order. Cogs uses similar mechanics, except you're sliding tiles with pipes and gears on them, creating a huge crazy machine.\n\nThere are a few dozen puzzles in here, of increasing difficulty. I had to do some diagramming for the last 8 puzzles.\n\nThe presentation, however, is the best part of this game. The sound is fantastic - you can hear the steam hissing, the gears grinding, the balloons filling. It's just wonderful to sit with headphones and enjoy the sound as you play.\n\nIf you stick through to the end, make sure you score enough to do the "Final Credits" puzzle. It's difficult, and so worth it!","September 5, 2011","true",""," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It only took about fifteen levels for me to hate it. No human being in the world can possibly 100% complete this game without a guide. Had the levels been completable in any reasonable amount of time, this would be far less of an issue. But being completionist is the only way to unlock further levels.\n\nWhen the game introduced double-sided 5 by 5 slide puzzles into the mix, I knew that in order to better my score at all and get to the next level I would need a walkthrough, which is always an incredibly sad revelation for a puzzle game. I'm even good at slide puzzles, I can solve a 4x4 in literally seconds. But the game soon became about memorization and perfect execution, not a real winning combination in my book. I would have rather there been more leeway for me to find my own solution.\n\nIt's sort of appropriate that this game was bundled with Portal 2 as Portal has similar challenge mode mechanics where you have to execute your solution to a level with the least amount of time or the least amount of moves. The main difference is that in Portal, you usually remember the jist of the solution to a level and the trick is being efficient; while in Cogs, where solutions can be 100 moves minimum and take over 5 minutes, remembering the solution is a crap-shoot at best and executing it efficiently enough is near impossibility.\n\nWorse yet, challenge mode in Cogs simply counts down your moves or time, so all it really can offer is a more punishing version of Inventor Mode, doing the exact same thing you already did for medals you might have already earned. The game even makes you play time and moves challenge mode in two separate tries. This isn't a problem in a game like Portal, where the least portals and least time solutions are usually mutually exclusive (or at least not the exact same thing); but in Cogs, least moves and least time are almost always the same solution, so it just feels like more pointless repetition.\n\nA good idea for a puzzle game lies in this debris somewhere, but for all the frustrating and arbitrary progress gating, I can't recommend you play this game.","February 28, 2014","false","4.1"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","2"

I had low expectations, but it turned out to be a pretty fun puzzle game.\n\nCogs is a game where you have to line up tubes and gears by playing a slide puzzle. Slide puzzles are often annoying since it's often hard to place the last few pieces, but Cogs sidesteps that since many of the parts are interchangeable. Usually, the harder part is figuring out where the pieces are supposed to go. Once you have that, there are normally a few ways to finish it.\n\nSeveral puzzles require turning the camera, which is done with right click and drag, which I found to be too cumbersome for the more time-sensitive puzzles. The rest of the controls are okay, though.\n\nYou normally have to finish the puzzles in a small amount of moves and time to get a good rating, but getting all gold ratings hasn't been too tough for me. "Challenge Mode", oddly, is easier since you don't have to get both a good time and a low move count.\n\nNot worth it at $10.

You'll position bells and gears so that a particular piece of music plays, stops playing or all chimes at the same time.\n\nTo make matters worse there's a time limit and move limit for gold, silver and bronze medals. Stars are awarded for these medals and are used to unlock more of the 50 levels. There are also two challenge modes where you can replay levels with either a 30 second time limit or a limit of 10 moves.

If you liked those plastic ones as a kid where you slide the numbers 1-15 around to get them in order, you won't be able to get enough of this, because the whole game is nothing but more elaborate versions of that.  The "bonuses" for completing puzzles quickly feel more like a punishment than a reward, because it quickly becomes clear that after the first few easy levels the only way to complete them in time is to already know the solution ahead of time.

The design and aesthetics is very easy on the eyes, and the simplistic but effective controls allows for a more fluid puzzle solving experience. Be warned though, while the pacing is very evened out, a few of the puzzles require extreme precision which may turn off casual puzzle solvers. Regardless of that minor issue, enthusiast puzzle solver and beginners will absolutely love this game. Sadly the sliding blocks are not randomized, so there is no replayability, and the extra game modes are simply reused puzzles. While there may be achievements, there are no leaderboards which is super disappointing. Overall this is a solid game that’s sparse in extra features that would’ve otherwise made it perfect.","February 29, 2012","true","20.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I still have nightmares... possibly early onset PTSD.\n\nI try to put at least 2 hours into every steam game I play. This makes me really try a game before just quitting, and also is the minimum amount of time to have Steam change play time from Minutes to Hours. That being said, no game has challenged me to make it to the two hour mark like Cogs. I know what you're thinking: "Steampunk and puzzle game? Sounds pretty cool." No. It isn't. This is quite possibly the single most boring game on Steam. I will never install this game again. It was the darkest time in my young adult life. No game has challenged me like this. I played Demon's Souls online back in 2010, I also played Jackal (NES) on an emulator without the NES lag slowdown from sprites. None of that compared to the wretched horror of forcing myself to finish two hours of playtime in Cogs. In this game, every 3 minutes feels like 20 hours. It's horrible.\n\nThe only benefit to forcing yourself to play two hours of this game is that it teaches you something. If you can accomplish this... you are a person who can do literally anything. I mean it. Anything. Nothing is closed to you. In that vein of thought, quit Steam now. Go start a company, or travel to the moon. I mean it. You are an amazing person, and I want to meet you, shake your hand, and we'll look each other in the eye. We won't say anything. Just give one little nod that says it all: "I've seen it too. Cogs. I am a person who can do anything now... I guess we have to fight to the death or something."\n\nSeriously.

It's not exactly the same, but a few of the pipe puzzles faintly resemble the hacking from Bioshock. Either way, this game has a neat art style to it and interesting puzzle ideas that make it worth playing if you enjoy flexing your mind in new ways.\n\nAlso also! This game has a hidden coop mode, that I think you'll only think of if you forget to think of it as a videogame. Remember picture puzzles where you assemble the pieces to put together the image on the pieces' box? This game can work the same way by swapping the controller around when you get stumped. Believe it or not, it's really fun that way too!\n\nOh, and I failed to mention, as the game proceeds and you solve the puzzle, you're often "repairing" quirky little devices that are pretty fun to watch come to life. As to how I know all this without a single hour played on Steam, I got this as part of one of the Humble Bundles, and tend to enjoy games well enough without running them off of Steam constantly. =)","December 27, 2011","true",""," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you enjoyed them, then I think you'd really get a kick out of this lovely little game\n\nBear in mind, they're ALL sliding-tile puzzles. The variety among them is delightfully done though. It's not just a case of constructing bigger pictures... Instead you're there working with an assortment of different pipes and gears... Sometimes on a single 2D face, other times working around a whole 3D block. It's an elegantly crafted Zen game and the animations and music are spot on. It's a casual, yet challenging, piece to wind down with\n\nMy only gripe - I hate the timer. Unless you play the special 10-move-limit mode (which you need to unlock), you always have it ticking away... letting you know that you're too slow to win the Gold stars. To me, this is a frustrating addition. It adds an unnecessary time-based element of tension that doesn't suit such a slow-placed game. Don't get me wrong, it's not like your level terminates if you're too slow... but it's enough to mar the relaxing enjoyment of it slightly\n\nAdd a 'Zen Mode' (basically 'Inventor Mode' without Time/Move challenges) and we're onto a winner. Other than that, it's a charming little piece","December 10, 2014","true","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The levels get progressively harder as you must slide each peice to direct steam to different portions of the contraption, or find the right configuration of gears to turn a part.  The 3D nature of the puzzles is really interesting.  A great game to kill a half hour when you don't want someting super intense.","December 24, 2011","true","4.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I simply love this game. Although, I'll admit, im not a bit fan of moving tile puzzles, everything just looks very polished and just drew me in.\n\nThe game starts off with rather simple puzzles but depending on the player, one can reach a hard one quickly. As an additional challenge, you can race against the clock and plan ahead to get gold ratings for both time and number of moves for each puzzle.\n\nMy only complaint (which is a small one) would be the resolution restraint for widscreens.\n\nAgain, highly recommended if you like moving tiles and machines.","December 27, 2011","true","4.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's not exactly the same, but a few of the pipe puzzles faintly resemble the hacking from Bioshock. Either way, this game has a neat art style to it and interesting puzzle ideas that make it worth playing if you enjoy flexing your mind in new ways.\n\nAlso also! This game has a hidden coop mode, that I think you'll only think of if you forget to think of it as a videogame. Remember picture puzzles where you assemble the pieces to put together the image on the pieces' box? This game can work the same way by swapping the controller around when you get stumped. Believe it or not, it's really fun that way too!\n\nOh, and I failed to mention, as the game proceeds and you solve the puzzle, you're often "repairing" quirky little devices that are pretty fun to watch come to life. As to how I know all this without a single hour played on Steam, I got this as part of one of the Humble Bundles, and tend to enjoy games well enough without running them off of Steam constantly. =)","December 27, 2011","true",""," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It make the game more varied so you don't get bored of the slide puzzle mechanic. For players who are looking for a bit of extra challenge, there are two extra modes which challenge you to race the clock or complete puzzles with a limited amount of moves. That being said, the game is very challenging. My skill with slide puzzles ran out about half way through the game. But I don't really have any complaints with Cogs. It's easy to play and difficult to master. It even has a cool 90s PC game aesthetic that makes you want to say goodbye to Solitare and Minesweeper.

Cogs does this to the old sliding-block 15-puzzle.\n\nThis game is, in general, much easier than the original 15-puzzle.  Rather than have to get all 15 blocks in exactly the right order, many of the blocks are interchangeable.  The different tiles will have gears or bell hammers or pipes on them.  Connect them up in the correct way to bring nifty steampunk contraptions to life.\n\nTaking the sliding block puzzle into 3D was a bold decision, and it brings delightful puzzle possibilities. On some levels, you’ll be tinkering with 4 or 5 sides of a cube, each with its own mini-puzzle on it that all intersect on their edge.  Other times, you’ll need to work out two puzzles simultaneously, as the tiles are double-sided and you must spin the entire object around to see how your moves on one side affected the other.  There’s also a time-attack and move-limited mode.  It is fairly easy to skip ahead over difficult puzzles, as the game is generous with unlocks and you will rarely be left with only a handful of seemingly-impossible puzzles with no way to progress.\n\nThe music is pleasantly inquisitive and upbeat.  The steampunk aesthetic gives everything a clicky-clacky feel.   The UI will swing in on a gear-driven mechanism, you’ll press a button and it will fall away to lead you to the next puzzle.  This gives everything a physicality and weight that many games lack.  Steam will hiss out of pipes, and the tiles move with a satisfying chunk.  Some of the most interesting puzzles are built around sound, as you’ll have to figure out a way to play chimes not only in the correct order, but in the correct timing using just gears with different width.  These were some of the hardest, most rewarding puzzles in the game.  The visuals are simplistic but elegant. There are no widescreen options, however, but the graphics are crisp.\n\nAll the puzzles are well-designed and fair.  Some of the time and move challenges are a little tight, but they are all managable.  The machines you will be building are interesting and varied. The decision to not gate content behind difficult puzzles unnecessarily is a refreshing one, and the devs should be applauded for it.

While the name "Cogs" seems to imply working with gears, the puzzles are actually more like slide puzzles. But here you're not trying to reconstruct a picture. In fact, the goal changes in different levels. Some require you to manipulate pipes to power machines, some are about making music, and others are just about connecting cogs. It make the game more varied so you don't get bored of the slide puzzle mechanic. For players who are looking for a bit of extra challenge, there are two extra modes which challenge you to race the clock or complete puzzles with a limited amount of moves. That being said, the game is very challenging. My skill with slide puzzles ran out about half way through the game. But I don't really have any complaints with Cogs. It's easy to play and difficult to master. It even has a cool 90s PC game aesthetic that makes you want to say goodbye to Solitare and Minesweeper. To those who love puzzles: this one's for you.","June 3, 2015","true","2.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

On some levels, you’ll be tinkering with 4 or 5 sides of a cube, each with its own mini-puzzle on it that all intersect on their edge.  Other times, you’ll need to work out two puzzles simultaneously, as the tiles are double-sided and you must spin the entire object around to see how your moves on one side affected the other.  There’s also a time-attack and move-limited mode.  It is fairly easy to skip ahead over difficult puzzles, as the game is generous with unlocks and you will rarely be left with only a handful of seemingly-impossible puzzles with no way to progress.\n\nThe music is pleasantly inquisitive and upbeat.  The steampunk aesthetic gives everything a clicky-clacky feel.   The UI will swing in on a gear-driven mechanism, you’ll press a button and it will fall away to lead you to the next puzzle.  This gives everything a physicality and weight that many games lack.  Steam will hiss out of pipes, and the tiles move with a satisfying chunk.  Some of the most interesting puzzles are built around sound, as you’ll have to figure out a way to play chimes not only in the correct order, but in the correct timing using just gears with different width.  These were some of the hardest, most rewarding puzzles in the game.  The visuals are simplistic but elegant.

The fact that it rewards speed and memorization bugs some conceptual part of me that likes slow things, but i enjoy moving the things around quickly to get the quickest and shortest solution. One of the main things i like about it is the sense of whimsy that's imbued in many of the puzzles, like a jack-in the box, and balloons that fly out of the level area when you're done.","May 18","true","6.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
