Your objective is to progress through levels by launching between platforms and reaching the end goal. Sounds simple right? Just wait until they turn M.C. Escher on you.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AmxqRpq1r4\nFor a game like this, precise controls are a must. Quite astounded just how smooth the controls and physics of the gooball and string were, you really do feel like Spider-Man in space. Keyboard/mouse seemed the best combination but gamepad worked fine as well. As levels increased in complexity the wonderful controls allowed them opening up much more. You are able to complete puzzles how you wish, which lead to some very cool experimentation.\n\nRelaxing soundtrack which fit the themes but could use a little more variation. 90 levels, bunch of collectables and both standard and speedrun modes should keep you going for a while, though I think a level editor and workshop support would be a great addition to the game. If you enjoy 'jump maps' and zen puzzlers, it's worth taking a look at.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/solarflare/recommended/268320/","solarflare","squiddingme","http://steamcommunity.com/id/solarflare/","169 products in account","As someone who loves games that use their basic movement systems as their core mechanic--games like Dustforce, Mirror's Edge etc; this is one of my favorite releases of 2015. Grapple is one of my dream games finally realized.\n\nThe basic mechanics are simple: you are a blob that can attach to the side and underside of platforms, jump, and fire a small string of yourself onto solid objects to grapple and swing past areas where there is no ground to land on. Further mechanics are introduced in the levels themselves, such as red death platforms, ungrapple-able forcefield platforms, white bouncy platforms and pink cannons.\n\nThe quality of the levels rollercoasters up and down--some levels make use of brilliant ideas and flesh out the basic mechanics of the game in fresh and clever ways, while others come off as lazy free-form collections of platforms. There are several weak levels and gimmick mechanics--for example, the invisible platform gimmick (platforms that only become visible when you are close enough), which is not at all interesting or fun and results in three of the worst "maze" levels in the game. Later levels fall into the trap of an over-reliance on precision momentum slinging, using long falls, bouncy platforms and cannons. This comes to a head with a level that requires slinging with extreme precision into another cannon, which can require many attempts.\n\nThere is plenty to do: collectibles are used to guide the player through the "intended" path of each level and give reasons to return to levels for 100% optimal completion. A time trial mode challenges players to beat individual levels under a predefined par time (which is a useful gauge of performance, since there is no online leaderboard for the game). There is also a speedrun mode that challenges players to beat the game in 1 hour and 20 minutes.\n\nAs with all games, there are a few quibbles here and there that you should be aware of:\nMovement is oriented to the direction of the camera; this can make adjusting to the side and underside of platforms somewhat awkward. It is something to get used to, but could ideally have been done better.\nYou cannot seem to remap the controls. Thankfully, the default controls are nothing out of the ordinary, but if you're an old guy and use ESDF or something, you're out of luck here.\nThe music is average to mediocre, full of aggressive synths, and can grate after a few hours of play. I found myself eventually turning the music off and listening to the Dustforce soundtrack instead.\nThe game seems to have no community to speak of, and the developers do not seem to have reached out to the players much at all. I believe this game could have received more recognition with a more active development team, online leaderboards (which I think would be the most valuable addition for garnering a community), and a level editor to extend the longevity of the game; as it stands Grapple basically hasn't been touched since its March launch.","December 26, 2015","true","16.2"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","10","10","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/poopybutts/recommended/268320/","poopybutts","Andem","http://steamcommunity.com/id/poopybutts/","618 products in account","I really like this game. It's incredibly smooth and fast paced. I find in this game you can be quite flexible in how you reach the goal most times. It's incredibly easy to start picking up and it just feels so good to be good at it.\n\nSomething I really love about this game is that you'll usually be sending yourself in the air for just the right amount of time as to figure out how to position yourself for the next obstacle or jump.\n\nJust a bit of advice too. Try not going for the little point blocks every chance you get. The game is much more fun when you're just flowing through, and the point blocks don't do anything special. Keep them in mind when jumping, but don't ruin your run trying to get them.\n\nAnd if the gameplay doesn't quite click in the first 10 or so minutes, keep at it. Eventually you'll just have it down and be swinging like a pro\n\nThe aesthetics aren't ugly, but nothing amazing. Music is nice too, nothing to stand out from it. No story. It's just a cheaply made very smooth-fast paced platformer, and i appreciate that.\n\nSome people complain about the camera, but I don't think that's all that valid for this game. You're in complete control of the camera and its up to you to position it so you can aim your grapple as well, so using a mouse is probably preferable over a controller. The levels are designed around this. There shouldn't be many times when the camera is working against you (since its all you controlling it), although I admit it can feel very weird navigating the curves/spheres at first, but it's just something you need to get used to for a couple levels.\n\nIt's a great platforming experiance, but offers very little in terms of aesthetics but does rather well for how simple it is. For the price of 2 dollars i got it for, I think it was really worth it.\n\nTL;DR if you like platformers or games where you swing around and junk, you will like this game. What you see in the trailer is what you get\n\nthx ilu bye","March 9","true","3.2"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","8","8","0","2"

It looks great and the controls and physics feel great. Unfortunately the thing that really kills it for me is the camera. It follows really close behind the blob and is always dropping behind pieces of geometry and obstructing your view. Movement is also relative to the camera angle, so if you have a really bad viewing angle around the geometry (which was often in my experience) and instinctively try to adjust the camera, then the blob goes veering off into oblivion.\n\nThe gameplay footage in the trailers shows the blob swinging and gliding in these unbroken graceful arcs, but in all the levels I played, I felt like I kept having to stop so that I could move the camera around and actually see where the grapple points were located, because if I swiveled the camera while in motion, I'd veer off in a different direction and fall to my death. And this game has you crawling all over walls like spiderman, so your blob will go over the edge of a wall, and the camera just faceplants into the wall, so you try to correct the camera by swinging it around, but that messes with your movement, and it just makes a mess. I don't know. Maybe if there were some camera options to adjust camera controls or follow distance, but camera options are non-existent.\n\nClearly I'm the minority opinion, but that camera and I just cannot work together.","September 24, 2015","false","0.3"," 36 of 63 people (57%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","57","36","63","3","0"

You get to constantly hurtle yourself through the air and attempt all kinds of insane jumps and tricks.  The grappling ability is a very versatile mechanic that makes traversing a level challenging and fun.  My favorite levels were the "junkyard" style levels where there are random shapes all over the place, and you have to kind of experiment and figure out your own route through the level, but there's no one right answer.  I also loved any time you get to jump off a cliff, build momentum as you fall, then grapple something at the last minute, swing under it, and release with just the right timing so that you slingshot yourself toward your goal.  I also tended to like the various indoor stages, especially the second-to-last level where you have to explore the invisible rooms to find the doorways.","March 12, 2015","true","48.5"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","78","7","9","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cyrilpanda/recommended/268320/","cyrilpanda","Cyril","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cyrilpanda/","596 products in account","There's so many problems with this game that the halfway decent ideas get dragged down into a swamp of frustration and the end result looks unpleasant from every angle.\n\nMinor points out of the way first:\n1. Graphics are cool for a bit but get to be very samey, every single level looks exactly the same.\n2. Music sucks, had to mute it like an hour into the game and put on my own music instead.\n3. This only happens rarely, but sometimes when you have blue forcefields up right against red platforms and you're going fast enough, you clip through the forcefield and die to the red platform even though you should be safe. Notable that this happened several times to me on the most infuriating level of the game (unless one of the last 5 or so levels ends up worse, I'm not quite done with it yet but blah).\n\nNow then.\n\nHOLY HELL THAT CAMERA. NOOOO. No. NOOO. No no NO! You cannot. POSSIBLY. Think that having FPS controls and a horribly zoomed in camera in a 3D physics-based platformer of all things is a good idea. But... there it is, in all its wretched glory. Do you wanna know what this absurd excuse for a camera brings with it?\n\nIf the camera is directly above you, you -can't move- because movement is based on the position of the camera and it outright gets stuck. This can happen from any direction, too, whether it's upside down (the most likely), right-side up, on a sideways wall, on a sphere, anything.\n\nIf you need to aim upwards to swing on something, good luck having any clue where you are. You can't see below you at all and you can't judge your vertical height so it's super easy to die in a rather unfair way.\n\nDepth perception gets thrown out the window with how zoomed-in the camera is. You wanted to hit something that looked like it was right next to you? Too bad, it's twice as far as you thought, now your angle is too low and OOPS! Looks like you ran into another red thing, BACK TO THE LAST CHECKPOINT!\n\nBut then, that's not all. This game expects precision. But the physics engine is garbage. You can only vaguely control your blob in midair. Jumps are so floaty and slow that it takes forever to reach the peak of your jump. You can only jump perpendicular to the surface you're on, so good luck positioning yourself on sphere for precise jumps. There appears to be air friction, too, the arcs I feel like I should be making always seem to slow down after a certain point, and the back half of an arc always feels shorter than the front half. The game then expects you to be precise with its cruddy engine, with small cannons to move towards and tiny collectibles in the middle of nowhere to collect, while you only get to vaguely adjust your direction of movement. It's not fun.\n\nThe grapple range is also WAY. TOO. SHORT. There's not enough length to it to get really cool momentum built up and there's barely indication of when an object is about to go out of range. As well, your aim actually moves with your blob, so you can target something perfectly but in the fraction of a second that it takes to grab, your aim ends up moved forward and you miss your target, plummeting into the depths of space. This is worse when you're moving at high speeds after being shot from a cannon, towards a small target that you can only just barely grab. Good luck getting that done consistently.\n\nAnd in the end, the game is way too long. There's far too many "trash levels" (the game calls them this) of just random stuff thrown about haphazardly and with no mind to actual game design. The game introduces new ideas but takes forever to do anything with them, instead choosing to keep revisiting old ideas that have run their course. The game has 90 levels but only enough variety to sustain half that. Tighten up the levels, pick the best ones (the ones least affected by the game's other problems) and maybe this would be serviceable, but as it stands, no.\n\nOh and, also, the invisible walls gimmick is just lame and pointless, it was never a good idea and doesn't add anything to the game, cut every last one of those levels please.\n\nThere's brief moments of fun to be found here and some genuine moments of creativity, especially involving the bounce-type platforms. It's a shame too much of the game is dragged down by its basically overall poor quality. It feels unpolished and unfinished, missing that extra step to take it from a decent idea to a decent game.","September 29, 2015","false","13.9"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","7","13","0","0"

Physics in a game are very important. They control your jump height, how fast you move, and your momentum. All things that are incredibly important to a platforming game. In every game that I review, I make a big point of discussing how tight the controls are, and these factors directly influence those. Every platformer needs to nail these absolute fundamentals, or it will fall flat, and won't play well. You don't want to be failing a jump because a jump doesn't feel as it should, and you want to have complete control over the way your character turns. Odd, or confusing character movement makes a game frustrating, and when a game is frustrating because it doesn't control well, it'll lose players. Platformer character control is the single most important factor in such games, and physics a major part of that.\n\nhttp://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/268320/ss_0450cce591b5bdb97de33de93018e431d3ac2664.jpg?t=1425920152\n\nSo in the case of Grapple, a game that provides the player with a very unique mode of travel, it's especially important that they nail it. And boy, did they. Grapple plays like the Spider-man game I've always wanted, and for someone who absolutely loved Spider-man 2 on the PS2, that is some serious praise. And now you're confused, and I can see why. Grapple, on the box, doesn't look anything like a Spider-man game. You play as an amorphous blob, who I took to calling Blobby, that has to jump between platforms to get to the end of a level. Sounds like a platformer, right? "But James, you said a Spider-man game." And here's why. The main mechanic of Grapple is, take a guess, grappling. You fire tendrils out of your body at walls, in a way not unlike the Venom symbiote, and then use your weight and momentum to control where you end up, quite literally webslinging. The tendrils themselves have mass and tensile strength, too. This causes them to behave like ropes, so you can wrap them around objects to shorten them and provide yourself with acceleration. It's an extremely cool mechanic, but one that does take getting used to. The range on the tendril shot is especially something that can be frustrating, and even 40 levels in I haven't quite gotten a hang of it. If you're not sold on the Spider-Man comparison, you can also climb walls, and use them to platform in ways that allow you to attack jumps in a variety of different manners. These two, kinda typically unseen mechanics, combine to create an imaginative and very challenging platformer, and one that makes you think outside the very sterile "how well can you jump" ideas that the genre relies on.\n\nhttp://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/268320/ss_13a1d1b6cc65c99e889bda9b3a37bd09c0eeddab.jpg?t=1425920152\n\nThe way that the game teaches you its mechanics is interesting, too. Tuesday Society have chosen to approach it with a "show, don't tell" mentality, and to that end, each mechanic is introduced slowly. When you first learn to jump, the whole level is about jumping. The next, longer jumps, further ones. Wall climbing is introduced as a way to get up walls first, and then as a way to move around corners and around spheres once you've mastered that. Later still, the grappling becomes a part of the game, firstly as just a tool for swinging between platforms, but eventually as a method for looping around blocks, diving, and even doing somersaults in the air. Each trick, and each acrobatic flourish that you need to perfect to be able to get where you need to go is taught steadily, and in a way that makes sure you fully understand it before you go any further. Games that teach mechanics like this are few and far between, and ones that perfect it are often seen as shining examples of pure gameplay. Mega Man X, with the way it teaches wall jumping, and Shovel Knight, with the downwards shovel jumping, educate the player in ways similar to this, and it really helps make both games stand out as platformer games. There's a fine line to tread between holding your players hands, and not teaching them at all, and Grapple, along with the two games mentioned here, tread it well.\n\nIt's important to learn those mechanics well because Grapple is purely about getting from the beginning of a level to the end. There's no necessary collectibles, and picking up the few that are there, are simply rewards for mastering the traversal mechanics. They get you achievements, but nothing else, and it's refreshing to not have to worry about them.\n\nAnd that's it. Grapple is incredibly simple in design and incredibly complex in execution. Its fluid, and it plays unlike any other platformer I've played before. It features a wonderfully simple soundtrack that fills the atmosphere and doesn't distract, and the art style is crisp as well. The bonus mode of speed running levels adds to the game by providing extra-challenging content to beat, and a game with this format needs that desperately. Extra content is always good, and stuff that'll keep you trying is a great way to retain players.\n\nIf you're into the platformer genre at all, and if you're looking for a third-person platformer that does things you haven't seen before, I highly recommend Grapple. It's imaginative, beautiful, and when you get that last swing right, it's an absolutely joy to play. If you're looking for gameplay, we also ran a video investigation in how the game plays. It can be picked up on Steam now for £5."\n\nMore reviews by me can be found at www.initiativecheck.com, or www.indie-love.com","March 9, 2015","true","2.1"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","4","8","2","0"

Grapple is what Gish could've been, and is just a blast to play. The game works as a casual exploration puzzle game, and supports speedrunning trials. The graphics are stylish and clear, and the music is very good. Gameplay is easy to pick up, deaths don't get in your way, and the levels are fair with checkpoints.\n\nI originally thought there were bugs with movement on vertical walls, but I found out that movement depends on your cursor aim. Placing the cursor directly on your blob will stop movement in all directions. Movement does get a bit awkward in 3rd person on vertical walls and spheres, but it's understandable. Seems like the major solution would be 1st person view, but that would be horribly disorienting I think. Still, the game is very enjoyable so far, and I'm satisfied with my purchase.

So if you're thinking about buying this game.... then wait for it to go on sale. 5/10","February 14","false","9.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

So the presentation is quite simple. Only one type of textures, no story and the levels consist solely of basic geometric shapes.\nHowever, where grapple shines is the controls. They just work great and have this cool feeling of being intuitive yet hard to master. Also the levels are build nicely around the game mechanics and leave room to find all kinds of short cuts to finish the level faster.\nSome more features like an online highscore or a level-editor would have been cool, but even the way it is I can definitively recommend this game.","July 28, 2015","true","17.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","1","0","0"

Although this sounds pretty easy because of having a grapple, there is still many obstacles and effects you very much.  The red platforms will kill you, so you need to get around those.

You have a goal to reach one ach level, and along the way you can acquire collectibles as well as a special collectible. Finding these are of varying difficulty.\n\nThe game controls feel okay. Sometimes, the requirement to keep your view focused on your next grapple point interferes with your desire to focus on an objective. I wish you could influence your momentum a bit more while swinging. You can't change your grapple length once attached; it's fixed to the length at which you were from your surface when you grappled.  When you're swinging past a collectible at just slightly longer or shorter lengthy, this can feel frustrating.\n\nThere's no real story or narrative here. The ball you control has no real character to speak of either. So it's really just platforming for platforming's sake, which may make this a hard title to stick with once a stage provides a player with any frustration.\n\nThe graphics are simple, and unfortunately a tad repetitive. The music is a bit forgettable, as is the sound. This feels a bit more like a tech demo that should get a full game designed around it (story, character, music, etc.), and as is, I don't think I'd recommend this to anyone but the most die-hard of 3D puzzle platformer enthusiasts or someone looking to really play around with a grappling hook mechnanic.\n\n6/10","November 29, 2015","false","0.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I know this game has potential to be better, however. Some of the levels I have played required so precise timing that I was almost ready to ragequit. I understand some challenging points, however, so I will not complain much on this issue. The camera decides which way you are going, and you control that through your mouse. I will assure you, if you are an achievement hunter/completionist, you will be saying "one more level" for 5 levels or so before you realize you REALLY should be in bed now.\n\nI will give this a 9/10, with one point taken off for the labyrinth level.
