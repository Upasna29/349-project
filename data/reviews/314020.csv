It was maybe 2 hours or so long, but I spent most of that time feeling frustrated and unrewarded. It is a very simple point-and-click game, only they somehow made the controls of a point-and-click game frustrating - you have to hold down your click to move, and the bug would frequently start spinning around when they'd reach a certain point along the path, and you have to figure out where you can click to get him moving again.\n\nThe hidden object part of the game is incredibly simple, and also somewhat frustrating - I know you're going to make me collect the floating orange balls, but I can't do so until I slowly move across several screens to find the thing that is going to need them. Lots of backtracking for no reason. No real rhyme or reason as to why doing a given gathering task ended with the results it did. I also wasn't really sure the game ended, until I saw that I had all of the achievements.\n\nThe music is excellent, the art is nice, but in the end - I got the game on a huge sale, and only spent 2 hours playing it, and I wish I hadn't done so.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/KilbeyFen/recommended/314020/","KilbeyFen","Kilbey Fen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/KilbeyFen/","3201 products in account","MORPHOPOLIS is a gorgeous-looking, casual slow-burn puzzler fueled by hidden object elements; one that I recommend with the caveat that it will certainly not be for everyone.  While not brutally difficult, it is a sometimes frustrating experience that it is well-suited for the casual puzzle and artistic game fan.   There is little direction; and the lack of the ability to save while in the middle of one of MORPHOPOLIS' five beautiful segments is rough, as the inherent beauty of this game is it's calm, wickedly slow movement and it's mesmerizing artwork.  So failing to finish a segment during a sitting results in the dreaded do-over, with your ever-morphing insect ponderously revisiting the beautiful yet limited screens.\n\nThat said, the episodes are fairly short, and the game can be finished in a short span (as short as 90 minutes), with all achievements.  But there is the rub; this is not a game you speed through; it is one you savor.  And for someone like myself who's immersion is often limited to nights and weekends by work exhaustion or time constraints, I thoroughly enjoyed playing through the various trials of our weary bug, as a calming cool down for the brain if you will... Though the puzzles vary from fairly difficult to rather simple, puzzle veterans may have a leg up on recognizing what it is you are supposed to actually do.  There is zero direction... but hit the discussion board for the concept, and off you go.  Only other minor fret was that in some cases, the hidden object items you are required to collect are quite difficult to discern and at times don't really resemble what you need to find; and I am not hot on clicking randomly as a strategy.\n\nStill, for what it is, MORPHOPOLIS succeeds in being an engrossing, beautiful, casual, albeit short experience that is worth a go if you want to step away from the bullet hell for a moment.  If you enjoy it for what it is, you are bound to be rewarded with a fun little puzzler that is certainly like no other...\n\n","November 2, 2014","true","6.7"," 47 of 50 people (94%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","94","47","50","3","1"

Never really expecting anything else from it.  But when I played the game, I knew I found a hidden gem.\n\nMorphopolis is a point & click, hidden object, and puzzle game set in a colorful insect world.   I love the atmosphere!  The art is gorgeous and the music helps to bring out more of the supposedly "nature" setting.\n\nThe game is divided into five short segments.  You can finish the whole game in 2 to 4 hours.  Basically, you need to guide the insect to find the objects and solve the puzzles needed to get through to the next metamorphic phase.  The hidden objects are fairly easy to find.  There are some that blend well with the background (but there'a a hint button anyway if you're feeling lazy to really search for them).  The puzzles are moderately challenging  (I find the last puzzle a bit more challenging than the rest.).  In some puzzles (like the glow worm, perhaps), I think you'll spend more time figuring out what to do than solving them. :D\n\nIf you are a card collector and an achievement hunter, this one's for you.  Only five cards to collect and you can unlock every achievement as you finish the game.\n\nThe only cons I found are:\n(1) the lack of direction / instruction.\nWhen I began the game, I only saw a "hand" symbol that tells me to move my insect to that direction.  And that's it.  But you can easily figure out the game mechanics as you progress.\n\n(2) you cannot save / quit in the middle of the segments.\nYou can force quit the game but your progress won't be saved.  You have to redo everything in that particular level.\n\nDo I recommend this game? YES!  For me, I find the good points of this game outweigh these cons.","April 17, 2015","true","4.0"," 47 of 57 people (82%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","82","47","57","4","1"

I know how fast bugs move in real life. I have seen them. Why do they move so slowly here? There's no reason other than to draw out the gameplay way longer than it needs to be.\nThe game isn't very good at letting you know what you can and can't do. The only way to move is to hold your mouse down in the direction you want to go, but you can only go along preset paths, and some of the screens are in places that don't even look like paths and feel like you'd only ever find them on accident.\nIt's basically a glorified hidden object game, except everything is so vibrant that the stuff you have to pick out doesn't tend to stand out enough. There were a few instances where I wasn't even sure what exactly I was looking for.\nThe minigames are generally alright, though there's two that are abnormally challenging compared to the rest of the game. The flower bud puzzle especially, which is painful both because of the puzzle itself and the fiddly controls.\nIt's very short. 5 small "levels". No real connecting story except that you play as the creature you helped in the previous level, and at the end you open a door and then the screen just fades out. Abrupt.\nThe game looks very pretty and sounds pretty nice too, I'll give it that, but it's slow and frustrating for what should be a relaxing experience, and not worth the money for what little gameplay is given to the player.","June 19, 2015","false","2.5"," 50 of 65 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","50","65","0","0"

The 'game', as implemented, is an exercise in frustration.\n\nPositive:\n- Cute hand drawn graphics.\n- It's different, stands out in used art and 'delivery' of the puzzles.\n- At 95% off, really cheap.\n\nNegative:\n- Total lack of graphics/sound/control settings (why do people keep doing this for PC games?)\n- Zero instructions, tutorial or guidance, so just click around and watch what happens and see if you can figure out what the devs were thinking at the time.\n- 5 levels total, with 1-4 hidden object puzzles each, some of which have additional puzzles after. Again, zero instructions so just click stuff and maybe you'll see something happen that will give you a clue about what's expected of you.\n- Level puzzles are spread out over several screens, so you have to make your bug crawl around, with regular backtracking required. Excruciatingly slow method of scrolling between level screens, and no way to speed it up.\n- There is not even a hint at what paths your bug can even take. No arrows, no clearly different coloured or constructed pathways, nothing. Just click the screen edges at different spots and wait to see how far the bug will crawl and maybe by the time it gets there it'll scroll the screen and hey, now you know. Or click a different spot and wait some more.\n- No save/load options. It will remember a level as fully finished, but leaving a level unfinished forces you to restart all the puzzles you already solved on that level.\n- Even with all that, it's an extremely short game. I fully finished it in under 3 hours, of which almost half was spent just clicking randomly and most of the other half waiting for the bugs to crawl to scroll the screen, and only a fraction actually doing any puzzle solving.\n\n\nI can understand trying to do things different from all the others. I can understand trying to be artsy. I can understand trying to minimize user interface and controls.\n\nBut for the love of all that is good and right in PC gaming, please never let any of that prevent you from implementing the required basics:\n- PC's are not a standard environment, and PC users are used to having pretty detailed control. A settings dialog allowing to change graphics/sound/controls is a must on the PC platform.\n- Some basic instructions about controls, method and goal of the game. Random clicking to see what happens is not 'learning to play', it's just plain annoying.\n- Save/load/checkpoint mechanics, especially in a game that makes one waste a lot of time just getting around on a level.\n\nSorry, but even at pennies, I can't recommend this as a game. Cute art style though, so check out the screenshots.","April 23, 2015","false","2.8"," 30 of 35 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","30","35","0","1"

Taking on the role of a caterpillar as it undergoes five metamorphoses into ever larger insects, you’ll find hidden objects and solve puzzling minigames across more than a dozen scenes — each as lusciously detailed as the last — all backed by a stellar soundtrack amidst a bare-bones interface.\nFeeling somewhat like Machinarium meets The Tiny Bang Story, Morphopolis has you walking your insect between scenes. Each location holds one or more obstacles that can only be overcome after you collect all the objects it’s missing. Sometimes that leads to the obstacle simply moving out of the way; other times, you must complete a minigame or puzzle. Most of these are fairly straightforward, though trial and error is necessary as there’s no guidance, and a few prove confounding, especially given the limited feedback on offer.\nAstounding presentation and imaginative world designs are what set Morphopolis apart. Each scene is akin to a painting come to life, hand-illustrated in gorgeous watercolor hues and pencil-sketch precision, and the world seems to grow and alter in perspective as your parasitic critter inhabits larger hosts. All the while, multi-layered and earthy ambient music sets a laid-back tone that perfectly suits the dawdling pace and relaxing mechanics of the adventure.\nThe problem is that it’s set back by puzzles that alternate between overly simplistic and too opaque, encouraging experimentation without providing enough feedback with which to gauge how your interactions affect the system. Morphopolis ultimately relies too strongly on its looks to get by with a relatively weak design.\nThe astonishing illustrations, excellent soundtrack, and delightful world of Morphopolis may be worth the price of admission alone in what is an otherwise middling hidden-object game.","July 1, 2015","true","6.6"," 27 of 31 people (87%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","87","27","31","2","0"

One fascinating game to play, discovering their life and beauty of the insects through Morphopolis.\nMorphopolis is a game where you have to solve puzzles and clicking on hidden objects. Looking at the artwork, it grabs alot of attention to your eyes because of how they used the colours in a fascinating insect world. Very colourful, you really do discover the beauty of the tiny world underneath our feet. The game has such relaxing music, it helps you concentrate on the game, very soothing music.\n\nYou start as a specific insect, you need to find all the hidden objects because they are the keys to unlock the puzzle. Once you solved the puzzle, you will continue onto a new chapter with a new bug. Every chapter, there are new insects. There are new hidden objects and keys for new insects and chapters, and the puzzles do get harder and I do find it quite difficult. Hidden objects are usually camoflaged into the colourful background. But the game isn't really that hard. All achievements are easy to unlock as most are just solving the puzzles. One negative thing is that  there is no exit chapter feature, which leaves you hanging in the game or try solving it. Also there is no save button, which if you exit you would have to start again.\n\nThis game is very short and simple game, intriguing artwork and colours used to represent the insect world.\n\n8/10\n\nMORE REVIEWS ON OUR CURATOR PAGE","August 7, 2015","true","4.2"," 26 of 32 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","26","32","0","0"

I thought the premise of embarking on a 'parasitic crusade' was amusing, that is actually kind of what you do in this. I really liked it.\n- Yes, it's quite short and a mobile port which might put some people off\n- But it has a variety of puzzles which I found unique, interesting and challenging\n\nhttp://youtu.be/yNosN7BgjTQ\nhttp://youtu.be/5lgMkRih1TY\nThe first level is quite simple you just have to find objects such as leaves and little yellow balls, complete a puzzle and use the stuff you find to complete the stage. Each level is basically like this but they gradually become larger and more complex.\n-----Each stage you take a new form. Each level ends with you resurrecting and taking taking control of a new and larger insect i.e. you burrow your little aphid grub into the head of a grasshopper then in the next stage you are in the form of that grasshopper, then a bee and so on.\n-----Yeah finding a certain amount of specific objects scattered and hidden randomly throughout each stage sounds kind of mundane. But I enjoyed that kind of activity, it's kind of like Where's Wally. It was sometimes challenging to track the last few objects.\n-----Interspersed throughout that were the puzzles. I was never able to figure them out straight away. There are no instructions. Sometimes I had to fiddle around to determine what you are meant to do in them, before I could even puzzle my way through them. But once I'd done that and completed each one, I found most them quite satisfying. One of them ended a bit too quickly before it became challenging. That one involved repeating a sequence demonstrated by the illuminating tails of insects, which became increasingly more complex. I think that one should have gone on for longer to really challenge you. That would have been cool because you actually create a kind of melody. Another puzzle was actually a jigsaw puzzle made up of differently shaped moth and butterflies. It was a simple idea, but I really liked that one.\n\nI liked the artwork quite a bit. It made me think of illustrated children's books that I've seen before. The music is really nice and soothing. Your insects dawdle along, you cannot rush around. So it's a slow paced and relaxing game.\n-----One thing of note is that this game basically has no options menu. This is probably a lot to do with the fact that it is a mobile port. I used windows volume control to turn sound down, Alt-enter didn't work for toggle fullscreen. So had to maximise the window and use a third party program to force into into a borderless window.\n\nI thought the game was short and sweet. Personally I'm not too worried about paying $8.50 for a two hour game. But obviously that may be considered a good price by everyone in this case. The game didn't really have much of an ending. You are just taken back to the main menu without even being taken shown the credits. Not that I really cared too much. However I think it would pretty cool if the developers add more stages, but I think they'd run out of bigger insect eventually lol\n\nClick here for my YouTube gaming channel","August 14, 2014","true","3.6"," 18 of 21 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","18","21","0","0"

Where that journey goes exactly, is not really known, but you will point and click your way through several beautifully designed levels, finding hidden objects to unlock puzzles and continue onto the next stage.\n\nThe music is rather relaxing and don't get old too quickly but after a long while, you may just want to mute it and play your own music instead.\n\nThe puzzles aren't too hard but will require a bit of your brain to solve.\n\nMy biggest gripe is control. As you are controlling your little critter around, sometimes it gets confused or locks up and goes back and forth back and forth cause it doesn't really know what you want. Instead of pointing and clicking and your creature going there, you have to hold it, and not al paths are self-evident.\n\nThe game moves at a very slow pace, so if you're not in a realxed mood, don't bother to play it or you might get frustrated with the slow speed.

Or why does good art happen to bad games, for that matter? After playing this, I'm even more confused about it than ever.\n\nMorphopolis feels like a blend of a small scale, 2D, point and click adventure, mixed with the weaker elements of an offbeat hidden object game. You'll control an insect as it gathers objects for an array of bugs or plants and occasionally assemble the body parts of other, larger dead bugs so you can occupy its carcass to progress to the next stage. No, really. I didn't make that last part up. I never knew that's how evolution worked, I'm learning things already from this game, which is an unusual exception, given how unwilling it is to teach you anything else at any point.\n\nAside from a not very helpful cursor appearing at the start to prompt you how to move, there's no other attempt to guide the player in any way. I don't expect a game to hold my hand the whole way through, but surely page one of chapter one of the game design manual should tell you the first thing you do is teach a player the mechanics of your game and how to navigate and interact with it. When you struggle to move from your starting position in a game then you know you're in trouble. And that's a problem that persists the whole way through.\n\nTo move you have to point to your desired destination then hold down the left mouse button. The first problem here is understanding where you can even go at any point. You can click on your insect to momentarily summon a trail of green dust around your immediate area and show potential paths, but even this felt surprisingly unhelpful. But even when you do understand where to go, getting there is a task in itself. Movement seems temperamental at best and my bug would frequently appear to get stuck, waggling back and forth while rooted to the spot, or else fail to move at all, requiring repeated attempts before it would eventually go where I wanted it to... slowly. Very, very, slowly. Because, y'know... insects are notorious for being some of the most slow-moving and cumbersome creatures in the animal kingdom. Really, something so fundamental as basic movement and navigation should not be an infuriating obstacle the player should have to constantly wrestle with as part of the game's challenge.\n\nThere are a small handful of puzzles added to the mix, but these aren't especially satisfying to complete, and like the rest of the game, no attempt is made to explain them to the player in any way. At one point you control a bee with the ability to hop. It doesn't seem like something important when you discover it, more like a cute little idiosyncrasy, but later in the stage it proves vital for completing a section. I found this purely by accident rather than having it hinted at in any way, and were it not for being in the right place at the right time, I likely would have needed to resort to a guide to complete the game. That kind of methodology to progression just stinks of bad design to me.\n\nIt's not a game entirely without its charms, as the sound, look and short play time are its greatest virtues, but when a game's world is more fun to look at and listen to than to actually interact with or inhabit, then you have to ask yourself "what's the point?".

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/markdj/recommended/314020/","markdj","dj.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/markdj/","2975 products in account","Morphopolis looks like a weird game. And an unique one. I can definitely tell you that it’s weird, especially in its art design and storytelling (if you can even call it that), but it’s not as unique as you would think. The game will feel very familiar to those who’ve played hidden object games before and have taken on a couple of simple puzzles in the past. And once you start playing it’s really not even that weird. You’ll see.\n\nBut Morphopolis isn’t for just anyone in my opinion. It’s short with only 5 levels, but it’s also very slow. The creature you control moves at the slowest pace possible and you unfortunately need him to navigate through the levels.\nNot much is explained when you start; a simple gesture to move your mouse from one point to the other is pretty much all it will tell you to do. The rest is up to you.\nI like the fact that it doesn’t hold your hand all the way through, but some of the level designs aren’t easily navigated and that results in your character getting stuck in parts of the environment or your character not knowing which way to go when you’re clearly moving your mouse to the right direction.\nIf we ignore these flaws the gameplay basically comes down to you clicking anywhere on the screen, hoping to unlock new objectives. New objectives can usually be found by clicking on other creatures and it then comes down to finding the requested items. Some of these items are expertly hidden and some of them are way too obvious. If you really can’t find a certain item you can always ask for a hint; a meter in the upper right corner will refill after you click on it once. After that you can request another hint if you wish. Anyway, it also requires a fair amount of backtracking, but the slow pace keeps it from being (and becoming) any fun.\nSometimes a better, deeper puzzle unlocks after finishing a certain objective. These range from a solitaire-like puzzle to solving a jigsaw puzzle. Around level 4 the difficulty picks up and I must admit I had a hard time solving the puzzles found in level 4 and 5.\nA story can be interpreted but isn’t necessarily there I would say. It’s about your character growing up I think but please keep in mind that that’s my very basic interpretation of it all. The game doesn’t end with credits rolling; it just brings you back to the ‘level select’ menu. So I’m not sure if it’s even trying to tell a story.\n\nThe art direction is phenomenal. I don’t know what I would call it exactly, but it’s colorful and full of detail. It’s definitely worth a look. Sounds are pretty much non-existent and the music on the other hand is pretty good. The game runs in a window that can be resized as you see fit but I’m not sure if I would recommend it as I had issues solving the music/memory puzzle because of it (or else it’s just a bug). In any case, the graphics remain sharp, even when the window is maxed out.\n\nMorphopolis is certainly a pretty game. But it’s not a really fun game. Even though the game isn’t terribly long I wish it ended sooner. It might be because of the (semi-)casual gameplay, it might be because of the slow pacing, I’m not really sure. One thing I am sure of however is that I would suggest people to wait for a price drop. The current price is just a tad too high for now.\n\n[Rating: 65/100]","August 27, 2014","true","4.8"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","13","14","0","0"

Whether it be an Indiana Jones style treasure hunter, an antiques trader, a supernatural entity or just the classic crime detective, Morphopolis puts an interesting new twist on HOGs.\n\n“Lose yourself in the mesmerizing, fantastical world of Morphopolis, a game about transformation and discovery.”\n\nIt reminds me a little bit like The Tiny Bang Story, which was another small but unique HOG, in the way the HOG elements are laid out. It’s more interactive and visual then your standard HOG game. Instead of just being given a list to things to find, you play as a bug, traversing its way across a lucid insect world. You click and drag your mouse to move and although the direction isn’t entirely clear I think it’s easy enough to explore and figure things out. You can interact with things around you and figure out what you need to be finding from that.\n\nThe gameplay for me was fine. I read a few reviews before I bought the game that suggested the controls and direction of the game was annoying to some seeing as it may have been a port over from touch screen devices. In all honesty, I found it completely fine to control and didn’t feel that directions were ever necessary. Although on gameplay alone I would say that if you took away the stunning visuals, there wouldn’t be much too it.\n\nThe art in this game is beautiful, especially on a bigger screen. The many different colours and details will keep you interested in what’s going on. Which is great given the games quite laid back pacing. The visuals in the game definitely make up for the lack of actual gameplay as mentioned above.\n\nWith that said, every now and then you get puzzles of which I thought were pretty good. There were a few that I did have to actually think about to solve. The last one especially being the hardest to do.\n\nOverall the game took me just under 2 hours to complete. It’s a fairly short game but I felt that it was neither too short nor too long, which is always good. It’s a nice little game to kill a few hours with and also get another 100%ed game.\n\nAs far as I am aware, the achievements are purely for completely the game’s milestones and its puzzles without using hints. So it’s an easy one to do.\n\nAll in all I really liked this game, it was short but sweet and generally a nice little indie game.\n\n\nTL:DR : An interesting HOG game with a unique new style for the genre. Basic gameplay but beautiful art, which more than makes up for it. Good puzzles, short and easy to 100%. Definitely give it a try.","September 20, 2015","true","1.9"," 14 of 17 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","14","17","0","4"

It took me about 75 minutes to go through the whole thing and most of that time was spent backtracking because your bug moves friggin slow and every time you solve one minipuzzle you have to revisit all the scenes for the next mini. (the rest of my hours is idling for card drops)\n\nI was also expecting to learn something about insects along the way.  However, the presentation is fanciful rather than realistic and there was nothing substantive to take away.\n\nThe game itself is mostly hidden objects and, mercifully, there's a rechargable hint pointer because some of the objects are very hidden, although that doesn't work in the half dozen instances where you have to guess that clicking your insect in the right spot does something special.  The hidden objects unlock several longer-form puzzles which are a mix of logic and visual matching, all rather easy, some downright trivial, with a couple that will take a few minutes to figure out.  ***Absolutely not solvable if you're color blind as some of them require very subtle color matching.***\n\n5/10.  If you get it on a good sale or in a bundle, it's definitely worth a little dabble for the visuals.

Kinda refreshing if you take the art style, scenes and backdrop. No mysteries to solve, horrors to overcome or keys to find. But as with all it gets a bit frustrating when you hit that one screen where you really don't know what to do.\n\nAnd that's the bit weak side of this game: you are literally thrown into the scenes without the slightest idea what to do. Some screens have hint options, other are deprived of that so you really don't know what to do and how to continue. A bit of experimentation and try-out is then the only thing you can do.\n\nWhat also bothers me is that the game doesn't have any options other than quit and 'go to main menu'. No settings to alter the music or sounds, no resolution options or even a full screen option.\n\nOther than that I can recommend the game if you like point-and-click discovery games in a slightly different setting than usually.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/badwhippet/recommended/314020/","badwhippet","Moonwind","http://steamcommunity.com/id/badwhippet/","568 products in account","Morphopolis - a 'maybe' game?This is where I wish Steam's review system offered more than a recommended yes/no option, because saying that this game is recommended implies that the game is more than it is and ignores a couple of frustrations, but saying the game is not recommended does the game an undeserved disservice.  So bear in mind this recommendation is actually a MAYBE, and read on to know whether this is the game for you...\n\nWhat is it?Morphopolis is a casual and short puzzle/hidden-object game crafted over 5 beautiful levels.  You start life as a small insect and, using point-and-click, must find your way through each level where you will metamorphose into a bigger insect.  If you've played the excellent Machinarium, the gameplay style is very similar (point and click, and find hidden objects) but there is where the similarity ends.  Morphopolis is nowhere near as long as Machinarium, the puzzles are not as challenging nor as varied, and overall the game is very simple to complete, with only the final puzzle offering any greater degree of difficulty.\n\nWhat's to like?The unique artwork and ambient music are a joy to experience (the visuals are gorgeous), and the lack of hand-holding will be a blessing for gamers who like to work out what they must do.  Every insect and every flower might offer some interaction (or might not) and it's left to you to discover.  Once you uncover an insect or flower that you can interact with, it will have some basic needs to be fulfilled (ie hidden objects - like finding 10 pollen seeds and feeding them to the flower) before it will enable a new pathway for your insect to use (either by unfolding a new branch to climb or unblocking the way to a new area).  Each level will have a final puzzle to solve, which are mostly of average difficulty and very enjoyable (if brief).\n\nThe not-so-goodThe lack of hand-holding would be most welcome if only elements that were meant to be interacted with would be a little more responsive.  As it stands, many interactive things need several experimental clicks before they yield (or not), and because there is no clue offered by the interface as to whether an element is interactive or not, you'll be clicking a lot of things to progress.  Navigation was a particular issue, with the player's insect dawdling at an annoyingly slow pace and frequently becoming stuck in areas that weren't actually blocked - especially frustrating given there was a fair bit of back-tracking to do.  There was a lack of variety in solving each stage (outside of the end puzzles) and it became too easy to solve as a result.  Finally, the last level had a disappointing ending: given that my insect successfully metamorphosed through each of the previous 4 stages, I truly expected to metamorphose into some big and beautiful butterfly at the end of the game.  Instead, the game simply faded to black, leaving me wondering whether the game had ended or not.  Because of the game's simplicity, there is no real replay value.\n\nConclusionMorphopolis is a pleasant diversion from bigger and more challenging games, and it's a piece of art in many ways.  However, it's somewhat let down by its short length without any real ending, frustrating interface and the lack of variety needed to complete each stage and reach the end-of-level puzzle.  I would recommend it in a heartbeat at a sale price, and would also recommend it at its full £3.99 price if you are looking for something pretty and lightweight to play for a short while (especially if you do enjoy games like Machinarium).  Otherwise, there are longer and more challenging games with a little less frustration that might be more worthwhile for you.","June 21, 2015","true","12.0"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","9","9","0","0"

The game is meant to be enjoyed slowly, taking in this interesting world. While I love the look and sounds of the game, I have a couple of nitpicks. With each level, I feel you have to click everything to find the next objective. There is sometimes some confusion about where your little insect is allowed to explore. There is a hint system that keeps the player from frustration. The puzzles are everywhere from easy to frustrating. Whether they are easy will simply depend on the player. With each puzzle you are left to figure it out, without any help or explanation. Also, once you begin a puzzle, there is no way to leave it. If you want to quit, you will have to crash the game. There is no save option, so once you begin the level, be prepared to finish it, or have the game run in the background. I had to walk away from certain puzzles sometimes, but the soundtrack is so calming, I didn't mind hearing it.

I'm personally not keen on hidden object games, but I thought I'd give this one a go anyway for a change of pace. Some some of the puzzles in Morphopolis left me without any clue how to interact with them, and I had to resort to Googling to know how to even grasp some basic controls. The most important thing I could have known going into the game is that clicking/tapping on your own bug is something you can (and should) do, which simply didn't occur to me until I read an introduction on how to play the game after becoming stuck, which kind of seems like the sort of thing the game should be guiding you into doing. The most positive thing about this game was that I was able to draw my wife into playing it with me.

And for 24 cents I obviously have no regrets. The only negative things I have to say about this game is that its a bit slow paced with the insects you play. I found myself getting a little impatient where I needed to go, but nothing that makes this game bad.\n\nOne thing I really loved about the game is the soundtrack, which I found very relaxing. The art in the game is colorful and well done. And the game itself is like a clicker mixed with a hidden puzzle game, which is really fun. Some of mini games can be a bit confusing if you aren't sure what you are suppose to do.

These items unlock a minigame, another item, or a new screen you can explore.\n\nThere is no real story: you control a bug which ends up in a larger body in each chapter, and that’s about it.\nTherefore, the game sells itself with a unique (slightly Moebius-like) art style. This somewhat alien landscape is a marvel to look at, but doesn’t overstay its welcome: most chapters are barely ten minute long– even though your movement is incredibly slow. Naturally this means the whole game lasts barely an hour, but if you like this distinct visual style, Morphopolis is an excellent pick.","July 1, 2015","true","1.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Finally done.\n\nWhat's Morphopolis?\nMorphopolis is puzzle game. This game educates us about transformation (metamorphosis) of the insect. Although this game reminded me about Biology when I was studying at senior high school, I don't know what kind of insect appeared in this game. At least I just remembered one thing, what Lepidoptera[en.wikipedia.org]is.\n\nThe gameplay?\nIn game, you not only see the beauty scenery of nature but also the relaxing music. There are five chapters in order to finish. Each chapter presents the stage of metamorphosis. You have to solve the riddles (finding the things and solving the puzzle) in order going to next stage. You can play this game for short time actually, but it depends how fast you can solve the riddles.\n\nShould I recommend Morphopolis?\nYes, I should. I recommend this game for puzzle and indie game lovers.\n\nIf you are not one of them, will you give a chance for Morphopolis, won't you?\n\nGrab the game man!

Upon running the game, I was just planning on leaving it on until I get all the card drops while I play either another game [or the Monster Summer Game 2015 like I've been doing the past few days]. But the first scene I saw (after the loading screen) made me go, "Woah." The art is beautiful, unlike what I generally expect from games that go as low as this. I'm a bit of a puzzle man myself so I decided to give this a try. I spent my first minute [after clicking on the first chapter] thinking about what the hell do I do because there's nothing that tells you how things work at all off the bat, not even any in-game settings. The hint button helped out a lot though, until I've gotten the hang of it. The whole thing is pretty short, even for its full price, but my overall experience was great. The only negative thing that I could say about this game is that with respect to the kind of bug you're controlling, you [the bug] just move too slowly.

Hidden object is the most accurate description, but it certainly isn't a standard game from that genre. There is no story and still you can follow the 'plot' pretty easily.\n\nThe presentation is unique and the music fits the atmosphere nicely. The animations aren't perfect, but again fit the style of the game very well. The controls aren't that great and guessing where to go and/or how to get there can be a bit frustrating. The controls just work well enough to finish the game, but you will run into some problems with them.\n\nAnother small issue is that you have to move between screens and it is awfully slow. It's a design decision to include this 'mechanic' into the game, but I don't think that it works particularly well. Still it only slows the rather short game down, so it's really not much of an issue.\n\nIs the game worth to play? Yes. Is it worth 5$? Well, no.

The screen is full of mesmerizing plants, leaves, branches and bugs. A relaxing string-music is playing on the background. Because of all the colours it is initially difficult to focus: what am I looking at exactly?\n\nIt turns out you are a caterpillar. Crawling around (using mouse) feels slow and wonky, but you'll get used to it. A cursor appears and instructs you to crawl and click on objects. Surprise, it's a hidden object game, the casual version of adventure genre! Every one of the five levels has several different things to find, some of which only trigger if you go near them and use your bug magic (by clicking the bug).\n\nSome stuff is difficult to make out of the background while others are very easy to spot. Finding stuff gives you power to influence other bugs or plants. This way you'll open paths to other areas. Your ultimate purpose is to morph into a greater being bug.\n\nOccasionally, once a level or so, a puzzle is triggered. Simple puzzles require arranging seeds in the right order, deducing perfect shapes or rebuilding scenes. Most of them are relaxing and simple enough though a couple of them were even pretty challenging.\n\nFinding stuff can be a pain because of the bright-coloured scenery. Never fear, as mercifully there's an in-game hint system that shows you where the elusive stuff is hiding. True to the casual theme, there's no punishment whatsoever for using it - you just have to wait a bit for it to cool-down to use it again.\n\nTwo and half hours later I had completed the game. It was perhaps a little short and scarce on content for the price. Nevertheless, it was a pleasant experience and also a relaxing write, idling in-game waiting for the last couple of card drops and listening to the music. Get Morphopolis if you don't shy away from puzzles but also wish to relax for a single evening.","September 14, 2015","true","3.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","1"

Basically you are an insect and each game's level represents a metamorphosis stage in the bug's life. The art style is amazing in Morphopolis and I really enjoyed it's concept. The gameplay is pretty similar to TTBS where you have to pick up certain items to have the chance to solve a certain puzzle. The hint system is well setup in a way that it cannot be overused and only utilized in a emergency situation. The game itself has 5 stages, and it's about two hours long. The soundtrack is very relaxing. I feel like I should have payed the full price, in order to motivate the developers to make more of this type of games, but instead I purchased Morphopolis for a ridiculous amount of 24 cents...

I can recommend Morphoplis if you are looking for a serene experience of clicking hidden objects and solving puzzles. It is let down somewhat by the slow and clunky movement in the game, but given how simple the gameplay is, I can excuse it. The first time I played it though, I couldn't work out even the basic movement, which is essentially point in a particular direction and hold down the mouse button.\n\nThere are only certain paths you can follow through the foliage, and it's soon obvious where these paths are. The learning curve of working out what on earth you are supposed to be doing in this garden somehow adds to the dreamlike quality of the scenery, and there are no textual or spoken cues to stop you thinking like an insect interacting in its natural environment.\n\nYou should come to Morphopolis with a relaxed frame of mind, because otherwise you could get easily frustrated. It's the gaming equivalent of getting in touch with nature and living among the flowers. It is a very short, casual game, but leaves its mark on you, showing what else games can be than blood-thirsty war games.","March 20","true","1.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

But the big thing is the graphics - they are very unique in their coloration and style and that makes all the impact.

The last puzzle is quite hard and to be honest I don't think I'd like to try my hand at it again.

It would be at home in classic illustrated children's book.\n\nIf I had one gripe about gameplay is that there is a point and click element to the movement (or more correctly, hold a direction and click) which is quite slow and sometimes it's not obvious what areas of the screen transition to a new area. That said you can at least click on your little bug several times to send out little 'feeler' particles that branch off in the different directions you can move to, although you may have to be much closer than you'd think for this to show you a path you've been missing.\n\nIt has a simple hint system, clicking the ? in the upper right hand corner will have the game point out an object you can interact with at the time. It has a cool down timer after use, so it's not really abusable. If you've found all there is to do in an area it will simply beep instead of pointing out something, however it still wont tell you where you should go, which again can be a little annoying if you've missed an area transition.\n\nThe game is short and can be beaten in under two hours, I played it in several short bursts over a couple of days. It may take you longer if you're farming trading cards.\n\nOver all, Morphopolis feels like it was aimed at a younger audience. I'd highly recommend it to anyone with child or young adult interested in entomology (the study of insects.) Those who have a marked phobia of insects however, might find the game a little creepy (and crawly).","July 14, 2015","true","3.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

I bought it (on sale) due to my interest in the graphics, and I wasn't disappointed by them. However, I was disappointed by the gameplay itself. The click-and-drag meant I was constantly putting pressure on my mouse and it got uncomfortable -- it could be made better by utilizing a "tap-to-move" function. Further, it was very slow-moving and the insect seemed to get "confused", direction-wise, making it even more of a hassle to move around.\n\nThe only part of this game that I did really enjoy was the puzzle parts. They were clever, it was fun having no instructions so you just kind of had to figure them out, and they were a welcome break from the otherwise monotonous game.\n\nUnfortunately, the puzzles themselves are not enough for me to recommend this game. If you're looking to buy a pretty game that's also pretty dysfunctional, then look no further; however, if you want a game that you can actually play for fun more than once, I'd definitely look elsewhere.","September 23, 2015","false","3.3"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

It's color palettes are rich, the environments are complex, and its cast of flora is so lush it almost borders on surreal. It is, without a doubt, one of the most visually stunning hidden object games that I've played  to date.\n\nUnfortunately, those stunning visuals make for unclear level layouts and hidden objects that are almost indecipherable from the scenery. The game's graphic elements encourage rampant clicking and inspire frustration in the player when they suddenly discover there's a whole new area they would have known they could explore if they had just climbed up one particular branch (that is, of course, identical to all the other branches that you can't climb). Many of the levels were aesthetically pleasing, but irritatingly busy.\n\nThe biggest flaw in Morphopolis, however, is the movement speed of your character. Your bug crawls at an agonizingly slow pace and is often confused by the clicks of your mouse, causing them to "dance" back and forth wildly. On top of that, despite being able to spot many hidden objects as you advance through the screens of the level, you can't collect them until you've received a task from another bug. The game forces you to walk back and forth several more times than necessary to collect items you already knew were there.\n\nIf you can get it for cheap and are a fan of hidden object games I would pick it up just for the art, but otherwise there are more polished hidden object games to spend your time and money on in the Steam store that are guaranteed to give you more fun than the slow, trudging pace of Morphopolis.","November 8, 2015","false","1.9"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

Art is lush and vibrant; excellent hand-drawn work. The music is soothing and very "zen". Gameplay progresses slowly in that you need to move your insect to and fro different screens and the movement process does get a little clunky, yet the slow and relaxing pace of the game compounds with the superb art and music to create a game that all in all is an excellent choice for unwinding and resting to. Very rejuvenating.\n\nPuzzles scattered throughout the game's five stages ensure that you need to at least think and brainstorm a bit to progress. While the lack of instructions can be confusing, once figured out the puzzles are novel and well-designed adaptations of widely-known brain teasers a la beautiful artwork.\n\nIn summary a fine point-and-click game for relaxing to, yet puzzles make sure that you at least work your brain a little. Recommended for anyone in need of a time killer; if not convinced due to the price just know that you are paying for some of the most beautiful art you will ever see in a game. :)","May 9, 2015","true","2.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Art is lush and vibrant; excellent hand-drawn work. The music is soothing and very "zen". Gameplay progresses slowly in that you need to move your insect to and fro different screens and the movement process does get a little clunky, yet the slow and relaxing pace of the game compounds with the superb art and music to create a game that all in all is an excellent choice for unwinding and resting to. Very rejuvenating.\n\nPuzzles scattered throughout the game's five stages ensure that you need to at least think and brainstorm a bit to progress. While the lack of instructions can be confusing, once figured out the puzzles are novel and well-designed adaptations of widely-known brain teasers a la beautiful artwork.\n\nIn summary a fine point-and-click game for relaxing to, yet puzzles make sure that you at least work your brain a little. Recommended for anyone in need of a time killer; if not convinced due to the price just know that you are paying for some of the most beautiful art you will ever see in a game. :)","May 9, 2015","true","2.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

So it might take a while for you to understand what you have to do when you open one of the puzzles. Trust me, it will put your mind to the test. You'll soon realize that each stage somewhat tells a story if you look deep into it. And it all sums up to a quite open ending which i'm a little dissatisfied at. Please make a sequel!

The only words there are the credits and the name of the game itself. Basically, you have to comprehend every visual element. So it might take a while for you to understand what you have to do when you open one of the puzzles. Trust me, it will put your mind to the test. You'll soon realize that each stage somewhat tells a story if you look deep into it. And it all sums up to a quite open ending which i'm a little dissatisfied at. Please make a sequel!

The artwork is mesmerising, the music is calming, and although the controls can be a little awkward at times, I love how smooth the transition between panels is- including the ability to grab last second object as you're already moving offscreen.\n\nWith regards to the puzzles- the tangled string and beetle swap ones being the best in my opinion, were well thought out and had a challenging yet fun level of difficulty. In retrospect one thing I loved (Though hated at the time) was the complete lack of instruction within the puzzles. On more than one or two I would be sat there wondering what the heck I was even supposed to do (Flower placement puzzle), but it's a great way to get you thinking and working hard for your achievements.\n\nAll in all, I got this game for about 15p in the Halloween sale, and I really wish I'd paid more for it. £4 would have been a stretch, but I'd say this one is definitely worth £3. At almost 2 hours long, it's a perfect game for a nice chill evening :)","November 6, 2015","true","1.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's fairly short (finished it in about two hours myself), depending on how quickly you figure out said game's mechanics, and it came go quickly. It's odd watching your character, if you can even call it that since it's a small bug you control, change and 'metamorphosis' into another bug and onward. Clicking and very heavily needed on back and forth searching for the hidden objects around the level, some things are hidden in one area are needed for something that is in an area back in the beginning of the level while others are needed for later on in said level or higher up towards something at the top of the screen, items are needed to persuade certain other bugs to let you pass and it can get frustrating, but it's a calming game once you get around to figuring out how to do so.\n\nIt's a mixed sort of game, if you are into puzzle solving and hidden games, you might like this small short game, if not then stay away since you could get confused and show great regret in buying in, all in all it is just up to the person who wants to buy it, I recomend it to those puzzle lovers and those who like hidden objects.","November 21, 2015","true","2.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's casual and slow paced, yet redeems itself with the artistic choices and atmosphere it has. The scenery on every screen is packed with details and every environment is unique, same goes for the puzzles - every puzzle is based on it's own theme, and plays completely different from each other.\nThe only dealbreaking issue is how the game controls and how cheaply it's ported to the PC. First of all, there are no settings for the game whatsoever - no resolution or windowed mode, sound, or control adjustments. Second of all, since the game is intended to run on a tablet, everything is done through on-screen UI, the keyboard is completely useless and the controls are limited to mouse movement and left click, even the pause menu isn't mapped to the ESC key as a common courtesy.  As a result, character movement is nearly broken, the puzzle controls are heavy and deliberate, as one would use the tablet.\nAdditionally the game does deal with a lot of death, including, but not limited, to collecting, reanimating and essentially playing a puzzle game with a multitude of corpses. Collecting dismembered or torn limbs from fallen insects is also a reoccuring theme, which isn't necessarily an issue, but can be seen as more brutal than expected.\nThe game lasted me only 3 hours, but it's worth for the experience.","June 25, 2015","true","3.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This insect tracks down notably larger dying insects, then patches them up and feeds them, pretends to be their friend. But as soon as the larger insect is healed and ready to move again, the one you control penetrates it's head, burrows it's way inside the poor insects' brain cavity and takes control over their body. Afterwards, you begin to track down the next pray whom to repeat the process on.\n\nThe game ends in you going inside a tunnel. It is understandable that the developers cut out the following part in which you take over a human, go lay your eggs in the newborn wing of a hospital and watch your children taking control of the newborn humans, and eventually, your race turning every other specie on the planet to mindless controllable puppets.\n\nNot recommended for underage audiences.","April 27, 2015","true","1.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You play as different bugs collecting items and accomplishing simple tasks across a few beautiful levels. The entire game is spent looking for hidden objects and completing miscellaneous puzzles to gather more items. While it is gorgeous and sort of fun, it's not very memorable and it is extremely slow and short.\n\nPros◘ The art is beautiful and detailed, but it doesn't make it too difficult to find hidden objects.\n◘ Most of the puzzles are challenging at first but they're simple once you get the hang of them. They're not repetitive.\n◘ The achievements are all obtainable over the course of the game, there are no secrets.\n◘ The game does offer hints if you get stuck.\n◘ Cards!\nCons◘ Very short, only five small levels and maybe a little more than an hour of gameplay.\n◘ No mid-level saving.\n◘ The entire game mostly consists of walking back and forth extremely slowly to get new stuff in the same areas you've already seen.\n◘ Hints can be vague and not very helpful.\n\nHad my character actually moved at a decent pace, the game probably would've lasted 30-45 minutes. You could easily go get a much larger and more interesting game for the price of $5.

The art is beautiful, the sound is beautiful. It's a beautiful game. It was clearly made by artists, and talented ones at that.\n\nSadly, aritsts do not always make the best game designers. The controls are awkward and confusing, movement is painfully slow and difficult to control, and there are times when a little guidance would be helpful - but none is offered. I'm thinking in particular of one puzzle where the pieces can only be moved as they are in those peg solitaire games - but there is absolutely no indication given of this. There's a whole forum thread full of people wondering why they can't do anything in this puzzle, assuming it's a bug. Difficulty is good, but obtuseness is... less good. Given how many "alpha testers" they list on their credits, I'd have expected them to realize and repair some of these large flaws\n\nStill, it's quite short, and as I said, it's very beautiful. At the extremely steep discount it regularly goes for on Steam, I'd say it's worth one play through. If nothing else, it's got trading cards. So I'm recommending it - at a discounted price. I'd like to see more from this developer, but I'd like to see these brilliant artists team up with someone who knows how to design a game.","September 7, 2015","true","2.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

At full price it's a waste of money, but at least it has cards and achievements.\n\nIt's mostly a simple hidden object game and fetch quest, with a few low-rent common puzzles (pipe, jigsaw, slider, etc) that have been seen a million times to draw out the game time. For the most part, the hidden objects are blatant, but I had trouble with some green ones given that there's just so much green everywhere. I didn't see anything original anywhere.\n\nIt's somewhat pretty, in a 1998 Newgrounds original sort of way, but it certainly isn't awe-inspiring art. Its Flash roots are very obvious. The music is good, in an unmemorable way. The controls are abominably bad, though, requiring you to hold down the mouse button to keep moving and regularly move your mouse around because the pathing is so bad and your bug gets confused. You move at a snail's pace, too. Too bad you don't get to play as one....\n\nA much better game in the same vein is Violett.

The art style is one of a kind. You are tasked with finding items and making things happen. Most things believe it or not have to do with metamorphism; collect pollen... watch flower grow... collect the end product.\n\nThere are also puzzles thrown in make you think, but are in no way too difficult to enjoy. Only 5-6 stages on this game so it's pretty short. I'd grab this on sale or in a bundle if possible.\n\nWorth $3ish\n\nAccidently ReviewedWas this review helpful or maybe even not helpful?

This can lead to frustration when you don't realize that you could have been double clicking on your character to interact with something, or when you are staring at a puzzle with little or no idea of what you are meant to do... so I don't really recommend this game to anyone that doesn't have the patience to experiment and figure things out on their own.

Within each level you have to solve several puzzles like sorting colored seed from a flower at the right position. First of all you have to click the objects which have your point of interest and then the game will show you what kind of objects you have to collect. Collect the hidden objects and click the (POI) object again to solve the gathering. You control your figure only with your mouse by pressing the left mouse button to the position where you want to go. Be aware: At some routes are crossroads you may not see at the first time.\n\nPros:\n+ awesome looking graphics\n+ great atmosphere\n+ good calm soundtrack\n+ slow game experience\n+ puzzle elements are overwhelmingly brisk (which not seem to be false)\n+ figure has at each stage of development one ability (suck water drops, wing beat to open seeds, ..)\n\nCons:\n- non-intuitive controlling (IMHO)\n- short game duration (could have much more levels)\n- no other game modes or chapters (where you would for instance develop to other insects like a butterfly instead of a bee)\n\nRecommended, even if it's not on sale, because it's a very interesting and brisk game, where you will not find one genre that fits 100% to. The world needs more fresh game concepts like this!\n\n7/10","September 1, 2015","true","1.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It is a very unique point-and-click game. The concept of being an insect and going on a journey of metomorphosis is quite original. The hidden objects and puzzles were not too difficult, but they weren't too easy, either.\n\nThe point-and-click mechanics could use some work. It pretty much required clicking very carefully directly in front of the bug in the direction you want it to go. It could not find its own path when there were multiple ways to go. It would also turn around and go to a previous screen if the clicking was not precise enough.\n\nThere is one thing that takes a lot of fun out of this game: the final beetle slider puzzle. It's so difficult that there's a long discussion thread about it. Slider puzzles are games unto themselves. To put one into such a pleasant, casual game is just infuriating. Luckily, someone made a solver to end the insanity.\n\nStill, it's a pleasant game to experience and admire.\n\n---\n\nFor more... My Reviews || My casual gaming...

I got it for $0.24, and at that price it was worth it to me for the achievements and the cards.\n\nThis is a fairly easy puzzle game.  There was only one puzzle (the last one) that I considered difficult.  I found the controls for moving my insect (point and click with mouse) to be annoying.  Most of the time you are looking for hidden objects on the screen.  After finding the required objects on each level, there is then a puzzle or two to move on.  There are five levels.  It's very casual, there are no real risks or ways to mess anything up.  You just keep trying until you find the objects or solve the puzzle.  Maybe about 2 hours of total gameplay for 100% achievements, possibly longer if you get stuck on some of the puzzles.","April 15, 2015","false","2.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

While controlling an insect, you retrieve a certain number of certain objects for certain taskgivers whether they be other insects or plants. The game in all takes maybe around 30-40 minutes. This 30-40 minutes can easily be filled with relaxation for this breed of game has its calming effects with its soothing music and simple find-the-things gameplay. However, if you are not the most patient person, you may not enjoy this game due to the slow movement speed of the insect that you control to move through different parts of a level. When you know what you are to do, you complete the task in a matter of seconds. It takes just as long, if not longer, to move between the different sections to progress.\n\nOverall, if you are patient and want a low-stress game to occupy yourself for under an hour, I would reccomend Tiny Bang Story, but this would come soon after.","April 13, 2015","true","1.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It's usually either hat simulators or rock simulators, so seeing something so artistic was new. The art in this game is beautiful, and so is the music. I would honestly pay for an OST also.\n\nThe game has a cute, melancholy feel to it, and the art and music are very fitting with each other. It's essentially a hidden object game, but there's also some puzzles and point and click. The gameplay is hard enough to keep it a challenge, but easy enough to make it casual and fun.\n\nThe one downfall this game has is the shortness of it. I've beaten the game in my playtime, which is 2.5 hours. (Well, almost. I kind of ragequit on that last puzzle, but I'll beat it later lol.) I'm not sure if the price is worth it. The art, music, and gameplay is tremendous, but the shortness is kind of upsetting. Hopefully there's a sequel or update in the future.\n\nSo overall, yes. I do recommend this game, even for the original price. But, if it is on sale, buy it, because it's a steal.

This 30-40 minutes can easily be filled with relaxation for this breed of game has its calming effects with its soothing music and simple find-the-things gameplay. However, if you are not the most patient person, you may not enjoy this game due to the slow movement speed of the insect that you control to move through different parts of a level.

It's very pretty to look at, the colors are quite vibrant and interesting. The problem is that everything is so colorful that it's hard to tell what's part of the background and what you can walk/click on, which unfortunately is the main game mechanic.\n\nStory: Uhh...basically you're a bug trying to bring all the other bugs back to life or save their buddies. Yeah it's a little weird.\n\nGameplay: REALLY BORING AND SLOW...I guess you could use this game to relax before you go to sleep? It certainly made me tired. You play as a bug that moves ridiculously slowly across branches that are terribly hard to distinguish from the rest of the background. This is basically a point and click game in which you click on various objects that you see labeled on the left side of your screen until you've gotten all of them. Each level has one or two puzzles that are usually knockoffs of pretty popular puzzles (matching games, checkers, and finally a rubix cube type puzzle which I couldn't complete in 30 minutes so I gave up). That final puzzle is absolutely ridiculous, so unfortunately I couldn't beat the game because I got sick of pressing buttons to no avail.\n\nOther than that, the music is kinda nice. It's very ambient, and gets annoying after you've heard it for a while, which is usually what happens given how slow the bug moves. I got this game for 20 cents and I'd say it's worth about that. I could see this being a free online flash game. There are only 5 levels, I (almost) beat it in a little over an hour. Get it if you like lots of bugs and looking at pretty pictures and moving really slowly. 3/10","July 7, 2015","false","1.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Alternatively, sometimes it would interpret an attempt to click on anything, anywhere on the screen as a command to move to the screen above if I were near the top edge.  Also by the end of the game, I found I was impatient with the speed my bug moved.  Apparently it had crossbred with a snail somewhere in there.\nAt least one minipuzzle needs to be a little more dynamic so players can figure out how it works faster.  It took me about ten minutes to figure out that I was supposed to click and drag pebbles, partially because when I tried clicking and dragging there was no feedback or indication that it was working.  (10 minutes to figure out to click and drag.  Maybe 2 minutes to solve.  Meh.)\nIt's short.  Really short.  Five chapters short.  I'm a very slow, stare-at-and-enjoy-the-scenery kind of gamer and I finished it in 3.5 hours.  (Confession time: the final puzzle took me 1.5 hours.  I'm terrible at those.)  There's also very little replay value except to look at the art.\nRecommended?\nOn sale? Yes. Definitely.\nRegularly priced?

But nope, I can run Skyrim with no drop in frame rate on my laptop but this simplistic thing jarrs just by having your insect change direction or if there are too much stuff going on in a particular level.\n\nThe art work that made me buy the game in the first place quickly became irritating the more I played, the style is not well integrated into the gameplay at all, the title screen made the animation look fluid but when playing the game you often just have your legs animated while they drag your whole immovable body through the levels, the same type of animation cheats they use on most of the non-playable insects and environments, making the whole experience look clumpy and ugly.\n\nThe controls are equally awkward, you don't use wasd keys because I guess that would not be “arty” enough for the developers, you have to hold the left mouse button in the direction you want to go and there's a 50% chance you might actually get there if you don't have to find something to click on to solve a tiresome puzzle. Most of my playthrough was spent just trying to get my bug in the right direction so that I could crawl on a narrow route through invisible walls just to collect foliage to open the next level. Only to find I had to backtrack to collect a different set of items to actually move on, if they had individual puzzles open every time I had to do this that might have been barely tolerable, many times it's just busy work to pad the game.\n\nI spent on average more than 20 minutes doing this alone nearly every level, this is already a short game and most of playing it is navigating nonsensical pre-determined pathways that made me want to kick my laptop into the ocean, if it wasn't through my stubbornness and the promise of achievements and trading cards I would have given up much earlier.\n\nThe hidden object portion of Morphopolis is really difficult, and not in a challenging or clever way, just in a frustrating eye-squinting way. This is where the art work really works against game, the objects you need often blend too well into the background or are so small you really have to get close to the screen to truly see them, or you have to access them by clicking the bug you control at a specific time, I only found this out through randomly clicking everything in sight and looking at let's plays, the game does not give you any of this information.\nMost of the levels are a homogeneous mass of art, which would be fine if it was just a very detailed background for a different kind of game, as something you have to slog through in order to complete the game it's a sickening and confusing mess that I tired of very quickly.\n\nWhich brings me to the puzzles, you don't get much help in this game, that's not necessarily a bad thing, but it is if finding the hidden objects you need often comes down to clicking everywhere and hoping you get what you need, looking through a walkthrough (where many of the let's players seemed just as lost as I was), or hitting the hint button which straight up tells you where objects are but only when it's charged up and when you're in the right area. Can't find how to access the area you need to be in through the invisible walls? Hint button not fully charged until the next minute? Well tough, you have to wait for the hint button to charge and if no hints are available just wonder about hoping that you can reach where you need to be by clicking on anything, maybe the game will help you find how to complete the level, maybe it won't, maybe you'll figure it out through trial and error, you probably won't, there is no merciful god here.\n\nAnd while we're on the subject, “immersion” does not mean slow and ponderous, being “arty” doesn't mean just plodding through weird surroundings with a weird non-story, you can't layer your game with arty visuals and call it immersive without any further effort on story, character or playability. While I'm sure many defenders of this game found it beautiful and meaningful, I and many others were praying for a skip button or any kind of save feature where we didn't have to go at a snails pace through the same level over and over again because we had the audacity to want to do stuff we enjoyed or look up a guide. Even an option to get out of some of puzzle modes so you can come back to it later or save so you don't have to repeat everything up until that point would have been a logical thing for this game to have, but I guess functionality doesn't win you illustrator awards so that isn't a feature. If the game wasn't so short it would be completely unplayable because of this, as it is it just makes the game annoying.\n\nThis game even fails to do a jigsaw puzzle properly, the art style while pretty (depending on taste) made what should have been a straightforward jigsaw puzzle into a frustrating rage game. Some of the pieces simply did not look like they were supposed to fit, lumps and bumps that were on pieces slotted perfectly into smoother areas, if it wasn't through a process of elimination I doubt I could have solved the puzzle. If this was unintentional then the developers cannot even develop the simplest puzzle with their art style properly, if it was intentional all it did was baffle me and frustrate me further, either way it made what should have been a beautiful game into an ugly experience. This isn't “challenging”, some of the puzzles fundamentally don't follow reasonable rules, there is no skill involved in these, only guesswork and irritation.\n\nI simply did not care what was going on by level 4, there was no incentive to fully complete level 5 for me, Morphopolis gave me no investment in the gameplay, the story (what little it has) and what few characters we see (if you can call them that since we know nothing about these insects and we can't know anything about them because “art”). I wasn't relaxed or charmed, I was bored and angry, even if the game's conclusion was so mind-blowing that it completely made all the flaws I found in it meaningful I simply cannot muster any energy to give a damn about it at this point.\n\nAs a further insult, the achievements feel hollow because they are awarded for just the level and puzzle completions, no easter eggs or prizes for additional effort seem to be on offer, and the trading card drops for me were only available towards the end of the game and are worth squat on the market.\n\nThis isn't what a puzzle game should be, this isn't what a hidden object game should be, and it is not what an art game should be. It failed to be good at any of these things, and even though I spent less than 50p on it at the time I still feel ripped off, the developers should feel incredibly lucky to have gotten a positive rating for this.","November 23, 2015","false","2.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Alternatively, sometimes it would interpret an attempt to click on anything, anywhere on the screen as a command to move to the screen above if I were near the top edge.  Also by the end of the game, I found I was impatient with the speed my bug moved.  Apparently it had crossbred with a snail somewhere in there.\nAt least one minipuzzle needs to be a little more dynamic so players can figure out how it works faster.  It took me about ten minutes to figure out that I was supposed to click and drag pebbles, partially because when I tried clicking and dragging there was no feedback or indication that it was working.  (10 minutes to figure out to click and drag.  Maybe 2 minutes to solve.  Meh.)\nIt's short.  Really short.  Five chapters short.  I'm a very slow, stare-at-and-enjoy-the-scenery kind of gamer and I finished it in 3.5 hours.  (Confession time: the final puzzle took me 1.5 hours.  I'm terrible at those.)  There's also very little replay value except to look at the art.\nRecommended?\nOn sale? Yes. Definitely.\nRegularly priced?  This depends on how highly you value creativity, puzzles, art, replay value, etc.  Personally, the art helps, but I need a longer game to justify full price.","June 30, 2015","true","3.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

As I poked fun at it earlier, we must now nominate this pack to be aptly re-named "The Fart Appreciation Pack", because all three games are massive turds.\n\n"Boy, this guy really is immature," say you to yourself, dear reader. "Why in the hell would he bash a game with great aesthetics, and a unique world to explore?"\n\nI'll tell you.\n\nSee, it takes a lot more pretty colors to distract me and instantly give a game a 10/10, like everyone else. There has to be substance beneath that A deeper message. That's why, despite all the artistic praise "Flower" gets, I'm still stamping my foot down and refusing to agree because it's overdone cliche message beats you over the head with environmental awareness. Now, I would say the same thing for Morphopolis, but it doesn't really seem to be saying anything. Just walk around, click on stuff, and solve puzzles. Wait a minute... did someone remake "Missing Translation" into a colorful bug world? Well, if they did, kudos to them. At least now there's a bearable amount of puzzles.\n\nSee, games like "The Last of Us" and "Spec Ops: The Line" actually have something to say about us as humans. (And yes, games about animals can say just as much about humans, too. I haven't personally seen one yet, but I expect someone has the brain and willpower out there to make it). But Morphopolis just seems to make it's selling point as, "Oh! Look at THAT! Isn't that pretty!?" similar to Over the Void- a similarly plagued game.\n\nBut above all these problems, I'd say the biggest one is the lag. Oh god, the lag! I don't know what's wrong with my computer, but I have yet to have severe problems with video game framerate problems... aside from Freedom Cry. But for some odd reason, Morphopolis will progressively get slower... and slower... and slower... until I ended up spending a bloody hour on a level that a let's-player beat in seven damn minutes! I tried to find the answer online, but all discussions on the topic are closed, or have been deleted. Why? Shouldn't these be left up so that way people with the same problem in the future can learn and fix the problems themselves? That's how I fixed my issues with Kane & Lynch, Manhunt, and Abe's Oddysee.\n\nEven if I'd fix Morphopolis to actually WORK, I'd still have my complaints. Too many puzzles, too much art, too little substance. A good game, but not one I'll remember tomorrow.","January 26","false","1.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The controlls are awful, with your insect turning around and going back if you overshoot slightly, or, as it was for me, every single time I tried to move somewhere, at least twice. It's very hard to know where you can go, what to do next, what you're supposed to be hunting, if the irational rage you suddenly feel towards women and insects says more about the game or you... It's a lot of uncertainty to handle, too much for the hints system to address. I got stuck in the second level when the full gamut of places I knew how to access contained no hints, and had to rage-quit. the absence of mid-level saves has a silver lining, in at least excusing my refusal to return to the game.\n\nBasically it was awful and I'm proud of myself to managing to review it without swearing.

In all other aspects though, it really doesn't.\n\nYou control a bug that goes from larvae to some form of avian insect reminiscent of a bumblebee. To do this you crawl (very slowly) from screen to screen through out five short chapters, collecting objects to manipulate the world in different ways. This part is pretty much a hidden objects-game. Sometimes when you have collected all the parts for one of the objectives you are rewarded with a small puzzle. These puzzles aren't anything special. The difficulty of the puzzles are for the most part trivial, but I got stuck twice because of a couple of very misleading or unintuitive elements. And that is all there is to it.\n\nI paid 0,19€ for it, and for that price I think it's worth a play through just for the art. For the regular asking price though, I would not recommend it, for that price I'd expect more game for my money.","June 19, 2015","false","1.8"," 0 of 6 people (0%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","0","0","6","3","0"

I think they should check to see if the game is going to work on a desktop with Vista before they put a game up for sale. Designers might also consider putting in an auto solve button where a player can just watch the computer put the petals of the flower in place. As it is I tried the first flower puzzle and wasn't sure the game was working right. Moving the caterpillar along the branch didn't work right. I couldn't get the petals to go where I needed them so I assume there's something wrong with the flower puzzle. I have a bunch of other games with horrible, awkward controls so why would a designer think I wanted to spend a lot of time fiddling and researching how to do the simplest thing with a 25 cent game? Just put in an auto solve button and let me use that. If I want to do it myself I promise I won't use the auto solve.

The artwork is gorgeous and vibrant - as you can see from the screenshots. There are a few puzzles scattered throughout, each of which are completely different. They aren't too hard, they make sense and some require thinking (if you're not just brute forcing it!). The game is short, but it remains fresh throughout, which is nicer than long and filled with boring repetition.\n\nThe movement of your bug is sometimes a bit irritating (especially when you're unsure where to click to move to the next zone), but it works - and you can click your bug to see where it can go, traced with what I assume are visualised ant pheromones...! Also some of the puzzles could do with more intuitive controls (the "checkers" style puzzle especially - you need to click and drag!).\n\nAll together a pleasant, laid back experience marred slightly by several jammy controls.","May 5, 2015","true","1.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I think they should check to see if the game is going to work on a desktop with Vista before they put a game up for sale. Designers might also consider putting in an auto solve button where a player can just watch the computer put the petals of the flower in place. As it is I tried the first flower puzzle and wasn't sure the game was working right. Moving the caterpillar along the branch didn't work right. I couldn't get the petals to go where I needed them so I assume there's something wrong with the flower puzzle. I have a bunch of other games with horrible, awkward controls so why would a designer think I wanted to spend a lot of time fiddling and researching how to do the simplest thing with a 25 cent game? Just put in an auto solve button and let me use that. If I want to do it myself I promise I won't use the auto solve. Either that or make sure your game works right and has some adequate text to explain how to get things done.","April 25, 2015","false","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Sometimes you have to solve puzzles too.\nThere is not much things about to be said, it's just a basic point and click game. Graphics are alright and well drawn. Music is calm but could be a bit repetitive. You don't get any help during puzzles and there is no tutorial. The game is not that extremely long aswell. it has like 5 levels or so. You have to use the backgrounds sometimes to move to a different area. Which could be overlooked. I think the game is nice, idea is nice - it's a bit short.\n\nThere is no tutorial.\nThere is a help system.\nMusic is calming but loud?\nGraphics are nicely drawn.\n\n\n\nOther things.\nYou could be like "ok, wtf do i have to do now?"\n\n-------------------\n\nI Give this game a 7/10\n","March 16","true","3.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Several aspects were done very well, but unfortunately just as many aspects were poorly executed.\n\nPros\nGreat art, always a wonder to look at.\nHigh variety in puzzles.\nUnique and clever game design.\nCheap, and even on sale often!\nPerfect for your biology gooroo/lover.\nPuzzle lovers will have a blast with this game.\nSticks to its format and its formulated basics down to a perfection.\n\nCons\nNo explanation on how controls work outside a brief cursor swipe or two.\nMusic is, albeit well made, annoying and repetitive after hearing the same instruments used repeadetly.\nCertain puzzles can become infurriating difficult while others are extremely simple, losing any feel of progressive difficulty.\nSome sound effects are loud and annoying, especially the fluttering bugs at the last level\nThis may be done on purpose, though it is still a con The game turned black once I beat the last level and got the achievment, making the ending anti-climatic (I'm not sure if this was a glitch or not...?)\nMovement is really slow and tedious, and moving from environment-to-environment is forced, so one mistake and you'll be stuck watching your bug move to an undesired location.\n\nNeutral/extras\nThe game was short (1.2 hours at the most for me). Means you won't take much time to finish this (this may be a pro or con depending on the person)\nScientific names for each level achievement! Cool!\nNo story involved here, just a play and watch game.\nHas card drops for trading cards! (More games need these...)\nA little difficult to reccomend to many people with the varies of biological and puzzle elements mixed together.\n\nVerdict\nSince the game is hard to recommend and has some bugs and issues here and there, but gets the basics down very well, I'd say this is a mixed rating. If puzzle games and wildlife peak your interest, then go for it, else you won't be missing much if you skip this game.\n\nRating: 6/10, slightly above average.","March 18","true","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The artwork is gorgeous and vibrant - as you can see from the screenshots. There are a few puzzles scattered throughout, each of which are completely different. They aren't too hard, they make sense and some require thinking (if you're not just brute forcing it!). The game is short, but it remains fresh throughout, which is nicer than long and filled with boring repetition.\n\nThe movement of your bug is sometimes a bit irritating (especially when you're unsure where to click to move to the next zone), but it works - and you can click your bug to see where it can go, traced with what I assume are visualised ant pheromones...! Also some of the puzzles could do with more intuitive controls (the "checkers" style puzzle especially - you need to click and drag!).\n\nAll together a pleasant, laid back experience marred slightly by several jammy controls.","May 5, 2015","true","1.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The tutorial is short, basicly you have to click everywhere. The thing that is not showed in the short tutorial is that you have different maps and you'll reach them by moving your bug in that direction (sometimes it bugs a bit .... but you know, it's a game of bugs so they wanted friends XD).\nThe game is quite easy both in the mechanic and game itself but it's still cute and interesting in some of its parts. In 2 hours it was sadly finished.... I want to start it again....\nSome puzzles where tricky because you need to use your brain and try to click slide or what else (click and slide stop).\nThere are no bosses or evil insects here in this game, everything is really peaceful. You climb leaves flowers and insect themselves to help the others with their own issues by clicking the required items to collect them and bring them to the bug in need.\nThe music is really awesome with the hang drum or pan, but after a while it can be boring if you'll spend a lot of time searching THAT tiny little item that you cannot see.\nThe morphism of the insect is not an evolution of your starting little bug, as I've thought and maybe you too, but after you finish a level, you'll use a different one.\nOverall I love it and I complitely recommend this game, thoug I was hoping it has more than 5 levels Y_Y...","June 15, 2015","true","2.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Get it cheap, it might be worth your time, but that is a very short time. A good portion of the time I spent in this game, I was distracted texting my girlfriend. It's kinda like a really pretty game of I Spy, but it's really over very quickly, and some of the features aren't very intuitive. For instance, to solve one puzzle you have to collect several of what I assume to be little pebbles of food. To find them,  you have to move your insect to little pods on the branch, and click on your insect to make the green particle thing happen. Either that, or you click (and drag, maybe) on the pods to open them.  Here's the thing that really disappointed me at the end of the game: I found out there was card drops. I have no motivation to play the game to actually collect them! I got one, but I don't even want to play the game again to get the other two, because it's done, there's no more adventure, and I'm just not interested.

The bug grows from larvae to bigger buggy forms, while collecting hidden items and solving occasional puzzles.\n\nThe game features 5 stages, a soothing soundtrack, beautiful artwork, sluggish and unresponsive controls, and a frustrating last puzzle which may take you minutes or hours to complete, based on your luck. I was lucky and finished it in about 10 minutes, completely by accident.\n\nSince I got it for €0.19 on sale, I consider it money well spent. At its full price of €4.99, eh, not so much. Beautiful audio-visuals aside, the core gameplay is really boring and at times frustrating because,\n\n(a) the bug moves really slowly, and\n(b) the boundaries of the playable area and paths to take are often not clearly visible.\n\nAll in all, expect some 1.5 - 3 hrs of playtime, with no replay value. Overall, OK, but "Would not morph into a cricket again," to use the lame review trope.","July 13, 2015","true","2.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's simple, it's short, and it's very relaxing to play.  I finished the whole thing in one sitting and was left wanting so much more.  While I'm not typically a fan of the find-the-thing game category, this one was beautiful.  It's exotic, innocent, the art is great and the music matches it exquisitely.  I feel like I ripped them off for paying so little.  It's only good for maybe an hour or two of actual play time but good god it's fun while it lasts.  The only downside, and I say this with no disparagement, is that some of the puzzles are not self-evident.  This isn't usually too much of a condemnation except that the game provides virtually no instructions at any point.  Of course, there's Google.  If you're at an absolute loss, do that.  There's a brief how to move sequence at the very beginning and the rest is up for you to figure out.  That being said, just get it.  It's so cheap.  There's really no way to go wrong with this one.  Even if it was just an art and music pack without a game at all it'd still be worthwhile.  If I can pay a dollar for over an hour of childlike wonder then I just won and that's exactly what Morphopolis brings to the table in the most beautiful, multicoloured and delightful way possible.  It's such a beautifully and richly put together game that I can't recommend it enough.","February 4","true","3.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bumblebug/recommended/314020/","bumblebug","Bumblebugbee3","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bumblebug/","250 products in account","Morphopolis is an "art game" if ever there was one.  I say that because I believe for this particular game the art is the priority.  That's not to say there isn't interaction but its gameplay is quite simple.  I'd go as far to say that the gameplay is designed to make sure you focus on and absorb the art.  The eye candy is nice but it takes more then that to design a good game.\n\nIn Morphopolis you play as different bugs who are kind enough to help out there neighbors with different chores.   Then at the end of each stage it appears you transfer yourself into a larger bug whom you'll play as in the following stage.  There isn't any written story instead the game leaves it up to you to interrupt the meaning behind you're actions.  Even beyond story-telling there isn't even guides to tell you where to go or what to do.  Restricted movement and actions is enough to let you figure out for yourself what you need to accomplish.\n\nThis game is super stylized.  The consistency of the art work between each stage is spot on.  The stages split across multiple screens which connect seamlessly.  The art is this Morphopolis is stunning.  The paintings are incredible and make you really focus when trying to find the objects you need.  You'll be looking at every little detail as your eyes slowly inspect the image.\n\nEssentially, this is a find the objects game.  As you play you'll come across particular plants and bugs that stick out from the backgrounds.  Each of them will ask you to find a set amount of particular items for them.  You'll need to carefully scan the backgrounds and gather up all the items.  Then proceed to deliver them in order to clear a path or initiate a special mini-game puzzle.  All the puzzles are very different and I believe this is were Morphopolis loses it consistency.  Until this point the game is fairly easy and relaxing but a couple of the puzzles are incredibly challenging.  This very bizarre difficulty curve takes you out of what is otherwise an immersive and enjoyable game.\n\nVery stylized and original, the only thing holding this game back from is it's struggle balancing.  If you think this might be a game you'll enjoy don't let that hold you back.  That being said I'm sure some people will really enjoy that added challenge.  Those who are worried about getting frustrated can always minimize the game a bring up walk-through for the really tough puzzles.  As I said before art is at the core of this game.  This is an array of visual stimulation that will let you relax and lose yourself in the world.  Look else where for a more interactive and more traditional "game like" experience.","February 6","true","2.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There also isn't a menu where I can tinker with the sounds, which means I have to listen to that annoying bug chirp in the background for the entirety of the game.\n\nThe controls are maddening. You click and drag your cursor in the direction that you want the bug to move, but unfortunately the controls don't always work. You'll find yourself dragging, only to watch your bug go back and forth. In certain points, you'll have to wait for an animation to finish until you can move your bug again - which can be upsetting if the controls are screwing up constantly.\n\nThere is also tons of backtracking, which makes every level feel tedious. Since every level that you play seems to end with you collecting a serious of orange balls, I know that I am going to have to do that at the end, but I can't collect them all before I receive the quest. Subsequently, I'm forced to backtrack through every single level to collect all of the orange balls in order to go to the next level that will ask me to do the same thing.\n\nBacktracking wouldn't be that much of an issue if your character didn't trek along at the speed of molasses. The two hours that you'll spend completing this game could be cut down to about an hour and half if the bug would move just a tad bit quicker. Unfortunately, that never happens and you're forced to watch your bug move uncomfortably slow through every area - which can be upsetting if you're someone that enjoys gameplay that actually moves at an appropriate pace.\n\nAlso, the last puzzle is a treat. By that, I mean, you'll be shouting at your computer screen and wondering why the hell anyone would develop a puzzle as ♥♥♥♥♥♥ as the one you're playing. In the end, Morphopolis is slow, boring, and unrewarding - the gameplay is too little movement, too much grinding and that's just no fun.

Worth it at a low price for fans of the genre.\n\nLong story  Morphopolis is a pretty hidden object game. If you do not like hidden object games, do not buy. You play as various iterations of insects that are moving through the world at a very slow pace for… some reason. As far as I can tell there is no story to the game, just a series of hidden object games and mini-puzzles set in a relatively pretty world. For me that was fine.\n\nMy biggest problem with the game was the awful movement controls. You hold down the mouse courser to move instead of just clicking; this results in some awkward dancing and can lead you to incorrectly assume that you cannot move further along a path. The movement is also way too slow and there is no option to double click to change scenes quickly, which artificially prolongs the game by forcing you to crawl back and forth between scenes.\n\nThe game also does a relatively poor job of explaining the mini-game puzzle rules as well as some important mechanics which can lead to some frustration. For example you can click on your own character which will is essential to reveal items in some chapters, but as far as I know that is never mentioned in the tutorial.\n\nStill, if you can get it cheap (I got it as part of the art appreciation pack for 0.44 Euro) and you like hidden object games, why not? It’s not a great game, but it was worth the two hours I spent on it.","August 16, 2015","true","2.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I was expecting game similar to Botanicula or Machinarium. Well, this is little different. It is more like hidden object game with puzzles, and insects.\n\nAt the beginning, you will probably don't know what to do. Well, just find some insect and click on it. You will receive "quest" to find some hidden object. After completing few of these, you will get to the puzzle (logic puzzle, so you will need brain and patience).\n\nGame is really not too long, of course, it is indie. Game time is longer because of slow movement of your "character". Yes, you are actually control and move with your bug. That is probably only major con of this game, because you will have to move from one frame to another quite often.\n\nOnly thing you need for this game is mouse, keyboard not needed.\n\nAnd yes, i am recommending it, price is not too high, music is good, puzzles are quite challenging, and whole game is pretty interesting, because (at least for me) it is something new, i have never seen game like this. And i liked it. Also if price (5€) is too much for you, you can wait for sale, under 1€ ;) Then it is definitely time for you to buy it.","September 21, 2015","true","2.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a combination of hidden object search and running errands - but the hidden object part is not really interesting, and the running around is tedious, partly due to the dumb controls. The only satisfaction to gain is seeing your insect advance and grow - but it hardly lasts until the end of the game, which was 1.5 hours for me.\nIn a nutshell - short, beautiful and not very enjoyable.

Half the time you won't even realize you can go somewhere until you accidentally hold the mouse in the wrong area.  Other times, your bug keeps moving back and forth in the same spot as you try to find the place that'll make it go not just right, but right and downwards.  Sometimes you'll try clicking an object and end up moving your bug back over to the other screen for no apparent reason, even though you weren't clicking in that direction.\n-On a similar note, you are SLOW.  Slow, slow, slow, slow, SLOW.  Which wouldn't be SO bad, but since you're constantly moving back and forth between screens (using the same crummy controls) to find stuff you missed, it's just unbearable.  I feel like the game would have been at least a half an hour shorter if I could change screens faster.\n-So much random clicking to figure out what's important.  See, you don't actually find out what you need to collect until you click on something, like another bug, or a plant.  Sorta like they're giving you a quest.  Usually it's easy enough to figure out what needs clicking, but other times, you have no freaking idea how you're supposed to progress without taking a hint.\n-By level three, you'll start to recognize that the weird orange orbs are gonna need collecting before you can burrow into your next target's brain.  But no, you can't grab anything you know you're gonna need until after the 'quest' is given to you, forcing you to slowly, SLOWLY backtrack through all of the screens to grab them.  I don't mean to sound impatient, but God.  Crawl across the screen a little faster, bug.  Come on!  Hustle, hustle!\n-No idea where the "pathways" to the next screen are.  Have fun crawling (SLOWLY) across the screen, only to realize it's a dead end.  Then crawl (SLOWLY) back, not sure whether there's another screen, or if you're just bad at finding items.\n-Did I mention that you're slow?  Because you're slow.  SO FREAKING SLOW.\n-A couple puzzles are really annoying for the wrong reasons.  For example, the flower puzzle gives you no indication of the controls.  I spent ages clicking around and hoping something would happen, but nope!  It's actually a Chinese Checkers-style puzzle where you have to try and get all but one of the seed thingies to disappear, but without a walkthrough, I never would have figured out the rules and controls.  Figuring out what the freaking puzzle is isn't a puzzle.\n-No mid-level saves.  Levels aren't usually that long, but if you get stuck on something and call it quits for the night, have fun slowly, slowly, SLOWLY crawling across the screen several more times to complete the initial collection quests again.  SLOWLY.\n-I don't know if I just accidentally skipped it, or what (in which case it shouldn't be so easy to accidentally skip, because I'm not gonna freaking replay that last puzzle just to see it) but I went into the place I was supposed to go, and... That was it.  The game just ended.  I got an achievement, and then I was back at the menu.  Ghosts 'n' Goblins had a better ending than that!\n\nSummary:\nIf you can get it on sale and really, REALLY like hidden object games, it might be worth it, but there are plenty of free games on the internet that aren't so, well, SLOW.  Seriously, I'm not kidding, it's really gonna get on your nerves.  Don't even think about paying the full five dollars for this.  I mean, I appreciate the effort the developers put into it, and everything, but this isn't worth two dollars and fifty cents per hour.","October 24, 2015","false","2.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It looks vaguely like one of those adult colouring in books and has a calming (if somewhat repetitive) Zen-ish soundtrack to go along with it.\n\nThe main problem is that the puzzles vary wildly in their difficulty. Some are really easy, like the Memory puzzle with beetles with different numbers of spots on their back or the glowworm pattern repeating puzzle. Others are harder and really difficult to do without a walkthrough, like the petal Draughts and the last Beetle Lock (never doing that again). There are also a few weird bugs (!!) here and there, like when my aphid (part 3 I think?) refused to dissolve the little red balls surrounding the squiggles I had to collect (I prefer to call them squiggles to imagining they're gross maggots or whatever). Like, he would spray his green goop and make his little sucking motion, but he just wouldn't suck up the red balls. Resetting the game entirely and redoing everything he did it fine, but that was really weird and I suspect would have put off someone who does not like wasting their time as much as I do.\n\nIt would also be really nice to include colourblind options in this game. A lot of the puzzles really need it (like the beetle lock puzzle) and, besides, it's the year of our luigi 2015 - you should be including colourblind options just by default.\n\nI would tentatively recommend this game, because it's cheap and very pretty.

I guess I'll start with the positives for "Morphopolis."  It's graphically well done and pretty.  It's short (2.3 hours).  I bought it dirt cheap ($0.19 instead of its list price of $4.99).  And, that's about it.\n\nNow for the negative.  For the most part, while playing it, you usually have no idea what you're supposed to be doing or how to do it.  It's one of those artsy-craftsy games that's exploring the boundaries of gaming.  Hand-in-hand with that, there is no win state.  You get to the end and say:  "Is that it?" (I actually had to check that I'd got 100% Achievements to figure out that it was over).  And, it's SLOW.  You move an insect from screen to screen, and the game cleverly animates that movement.  At a crawl.  It's and exercise in frustration because you have to crawl from screen to screen over and over again looking for little sprites buried in the scenery.  And, along with all of that, during the game, you don't even know if you can quit and save your state.  After an hour of this frustration, I really wanted to put it aside and recover.  But, I was afraid to quit because I was worried I'd have to repeat everything up to that point again.\n\nSo, if you want an "interesting" game with "interesting" art and "interesting" mechanics and can find this at practically nothing, go ahead and buy it.  Otherwise, just pass on by.","June 12, 2015","false","2.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The tutorial is short, basicly you have to click everywhere. The thing that is not showed in the short tutorial is that you have different maps and you'll reach them by moving your bug in that direction (sometimes it bugs a bit .... but you know, it's a game of bugs so they wanted friends XD).\nThe game is quite easy both in the mechanic and game itself but it's still cute and interesting in some of its parts. In 2 hours it was sadly finished.... I want to start it again....\nSome puzzles where tricky because you need to use your brain and try to click slide or what else (click and slide stop).\nThere are no bosses or evil insects here in this game, everything is really peaceful. You climb leaves flowers and insect themselves to help the others with their own issues by clicking the required items to collect them and bring them to the bug in need.\nThe music is really awesome with the hang drum or pan, but after a while it can be boring if you'll spend a lot of time searching THAT tiny little item that you cannot see.\nThe morphism of the insect is not an evolution of your starting little bug, as I've thought and maybe you too, but after you finish a level, you'll use a different one.\nOverall I love it and I complitely recommend this game, thoug I was hoping it has more than 5 levels Y_Y...","June 15, 2015","true","2.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But then you hit the "puzzles" which are a who's who of the most boring Adventure game tropes: a game of Memory, Simon Says, a couple of simple jigsaw puzzles, a "turn the things to make various paths line up", draughts (the peg game from Cracker Barrel), and one of those "turn the dials to match everything up, but as you try to match them it messes the others up". At best, these kinds of puzzles add very little to a game, but at worst, like here, they add a completely unnecesary level of boredome and frustration.\n\nI'm all for "difficult" games like Dark Souls, but this game should have stuck the relaxing formula of other hidden object games.","February 18","false","3.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Whenever the price drops for a while again, then yes, especially if you feel charmed by the look of the game. However everything above 2 Euro would seem too much pricy n my opinion... Here's why:\n\nPro:\n* the artful drawings and likable meditation-inducing piano-sound give off a very nice and enjoyable atmosphere\n* this game is in reality a Hidden Object Game - search for half-hidden stuff in 2D-sceneries filled to the rim with details and in between play a number of different minigames. Which is great in my opinion because I love HOGs. Well, if you don't, that might not be a Plus for you then...\n* if you have ever played a bunch of HOGs, you will immediately recognize the minigames and will know what you have to do, as they are all very typical and not too hard to solve\n* Morphopolis also has elements of an adventure as you have to "control" an insect and make it crawl around a bit plus you'll have to click on some cratures or plants to "hand in" stuff you've found/collected. But this is very little adventure-like gameplay all in all, much less than most modern HOGs feature actually. Not even as much "adventure" as in Botanicula or Samorost, although Morphopolis might make you think of games like that instinctively\n\nContra:\n* the game is extremely short. E.x.t.r.e.m.e.l.y. I finished it within 2 hours, which included a coffee-break. To be more precisely: Morphopolis only has 5 "chapters", consisting of 17 screens/scenes and 7 minigames in total (if I did not miscalculate).\nI really wonder why it has to be so short? It couldn't have been so hard to add many more sceneries, more stuff to collect, and perhaps also more of the re-usable types of minigames - especially the beautiful butterfly jigsaw or the "plant repair"-game. Did the developers just lose interest all of a sudden whilst making the game, or did they have a fight and decided to stop working together instantly?\n* if Morphopolis was just a point-and-click-game I would have finished it within 1 hour. But the developers had this "brilliant" *coughs* idea to make the game "last longer" by letting your insectoid avatar crawl only very, very slowly. Painfully slowly :(\n* the controls add to your discomfort - the way how to move and where to move your insect are horribly rigid. It does not help much that by clicking and holding your left mouse button on the insect it will emit dark greenish ... uh... I really think it looks like dung ... to give a hint about possible paths it can take next within a close radius\n* it takes a lot of patience to make your insect go where you want it to, but then you make one wrong click and your insect will quickly switch to the next/former screen even if you didn't want that -_-\n* in chapter two your insect has to eat/suck three egglike things, which you can only find out by sheer luck like by clicking around wildly and hitting one of the eggs per chance. And there's this one minigame in chapter 5 where you have to "swipe" with the cursor to let a small heap of seeds "jump" over others. It took me quite a while and luck to find out how to move these piles of seed :( No explanations for the controls to be found for minigames anywhere. Is this supposed to be "part of the fun"? Well, not for me, sorry.\n* you also cannot skip any minigames, which can be really frustrating for some people. Well, but if you could, then the game would be over in the blink of an eye; so I guess that's why you can't... Pity.\n* for an Hidden Object Game the stuff you have to find is not "hidden" well nor cleverly. Sometimes it is nearly invisible, which will make you click wildly all over your screen after a while - that will do the trick, but will leave you unsatisfied. With this kind of interesting, detailled and colorful background, blending stuff in could have been done 100 times better\n* the "story" about transformation lacks a bit too in my opinion, as in three levels the "goal" of your insect is to meet with a much larger insect and seemingly to dig into it's head, which does not make much sense...\n\nConclusion: there are many beautiful hand-drawn artistic games with relaxing music and interesting ideas out there. Morphopolis definitely has the potential to be a real gem of this genre. But it turned out to be a mere sherd. Makes me want to replay Botanicula and sing along with the frogs ;)","May 11, 2015","true","2.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Also, just a heads up, there is no explanation on how to solve the puzzles but if you tinker around you tend to figure them out for yourself. There are 5 levels that generally stay the same difficulty but only grow with more "tasks" (i.e. collect petals, etc). You're bug form changes with each level and does get some "special abilities" with the different morphs  (i.e. buzzing your wings to blow away petals so you can recover seeds, that sort of thing)  Overall, I would say its a 7.5/10\n\nPros:\n-Beautiful scenery\n-Nice music\n-Decent concept\n\nCons:\n-No explanations on how to solve puzzles (but if you play a lot of Artifex Mundi games you probably stand a better chance)\n-Extremely short (i got a perfect game in under an hour......)\n\nEhs:\n-Movement is weird\n-You are incredibly slow which is probably to make the game last longer\n-What exactly are we doing to the giant bugs at the end of the levels?

Provide a game that runs off the player's curiosity, and provide a few simple puzzles for the player to figure out on their own.  I love how it had no dialogue, leaving me to try and figure out what the heck I was doing for most of the time.  Though it's controls are restricted to the mouse, the game still feels like the antithesis of a lot of modern games, and feels like it pays tribute to an era lost in gaming where hand holding wasn't mandatory.\n\nPros\n\nVery pleasing asthetic.  From what I understand, it was hand-drawn, and looked very good.  A lot of life from a soft palette, and I didn't feel like any problematic circumstances were due to the visuals.\n\nAgain, I had a lot of freedom (even though the gameplay was technically on rails) to explore and tackle the puzzles as they came.  You don't see that often nowadays.\n\nCons\n\nThe music was a bit of a wash.  My experience only lasted about an hour and a half, but most of the music is just some percussion and a xylophone - which wasn't as immersive when it hasn't noticibly changed 80% through the game.  I think there were other types of music at the start of the levels, but they inevitably sounded the same.\n\nMy Verdict\n\nI think anyone who is considering buying this should understand what it was made for - a brief session of immersive puzzle solving in a visualy pleasing art style.  I personally, enjoyed my experience with it (where others clearly have not).  It's short, sweet, and - though I don't think of it as a particularly memorable experience - believe it was worth my time.\n\n7 / 10","September 24, 2015","true","1.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Whether it sounds salty or not - it ruined the game for me.\nYou have this beautiful landscape to look at, and sure, the bug moves along at the slowest pace imaginable - I can deal with that, I just look at the pretties and whatever, but the last puzzle? Good god, seriously, if you removed the last puzzle or changed it or something, I'd pay more, I really would.\nThe other puzzles throughout the game are great, they get a bit difficult at times and I know from the game forums that people who are colour blind struggle with some parts, so to have such a road block right at the end of an otherwise peaceful, chilled game just ♥♥♥♥ all over it for me personally.\n\nThe music is lovely, the game looks wonderful. Your little bug dude moves at a snail's pace and while the game has hidden object elements it's relatively straightforward. Get ready to back track quite a lot however as these objects are strewn across several screens.\n\nI personally wouldn't have minded less game time in return for less back tracking, it feels like you're being forced to just play for longer sometimes and that's never enjoyable in a game that is already pretty short. I would say the achievements are easy to get but I still just can't get past the last puzzle so I can't 100% :(\n\nAlso, the game doesn't feature a proper save system, so if you get mid way through a scene, DON'T quit, because you'll be forced to start the entire level again from the beginning (again, wouldn't be as much of a ball ache if the bug didn't move so slow). At present I can't bring myself to stare at that last puzzle for the 15 minutes I've already sank into the activity, but I recommend the game based on its otherwise pleasant presentation.\n\n(....but really I want to be a petty ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and click 'no' purely because of that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ bug puzzle...can you taste the salt?)","October 29, 2015","true","1.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'm so glad I did. This is a very small, quirky game, but it's a beautiful little gem well worth your time.\n\nThe music and hand-drawn insect and nature art create a very peaceful, otherworldly atmosphere to explore. There are no words or text instructions, but the game has a hint button which will highlight your next step if you can't figure out what to do next. Gameplay is basically hidden item-gathering exploration, interspersed with a puzzle in each chapter. The game progresses in a way that feels natural to understand. The puzzles can be tricky, but not impossible, and everything about the game is satisfying when you figure things out on your own. That said, if you get totally stuck on a puzzle and need a nudge in the right direction, check out the excellent Steam guides people have written.\n\nSome caveats: There are five chapters, and if you close the game in the middle of a chapter, you'll have to start from the beginning of that chapter again. I can't find this as a flaw since the chapters take so little time to complete (you can finish the game with all achievements in 2-3 hours), but it's something to know before you play.\n\nYou also can't close the game during a puzzle, but again, most of them don't take very long to solve. One reviewer complained that puzzles have no reset button if you mess them up, but none of them can be messed up except the chapter 4 puzzle, which does have a reset button (the yellow spot on the right of the puzzle).\n\nThis is a very small, lovely little world to spend a couple of hours in, and I recommend it.","July 3, 2015","true","2.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I certainly had a bit of a nostalgia hard-on while playing this game, full disclaimer on that one.\n\nI'd certainly say Morphopolis is quite therapeutic (unless you hate bugs), it has calming music, a vibrant environment that somehow feels huge, empty, and filled to the brim at the same time through its artistic use of the whole bug-world. There are plenty of times where you'll feel like the game is moving way too slow, and you will be stumped heavily on a puzzle or two here and there, perhaps to a point of rage, but in the end it makes you feel more accomplished. There even is a noticable progression between levels which gives you an air on familiarity in a new, strange environment.\n\nIn the end, the game doesn't take too long to beat. But the apprehension and depiction of the whole game makes it feel longer, it gives you a feeling of being accomplished and completed.

There are very few games of this variety. At first glance you might think that this is just an artificial life simulator type of game (Examples of such games are Simlife, Simant, and Spore). But, you would be wrong. Because this is actually a 2D, point and click game with puzzles (LOTS of them to say the least). You start the game off by playing as a caterpillar, and you must help the caterpillar create a cocoon in order to proceed to the next level. Don't start thinking that you'll play as a caterpillar in every level, there actually are other insects in this game you can play as later on. Don't worry, I won't give away the names of the other insects or describe their appearances (assuming you're a gamer who likes surprises). There are puzzles in every level of Morphopolis. A puzzle can be accessed by collecting a certain amount of items (Sticks, berries, pollen, etc.). Some puzzles are easily solved in a matter of minutes, while others will have you leaning your head against your hand wondering how on earth you can find a solution to the current puzzle. The artwork in this game is absolutely beautiful. But the animation is somewhat cheap (Seems like the kind of animation you'd see in a Newgrounds game). Now as for the soundtrack, it's very atmospheric, and fits the game like a glove. The only complaint I have with this game is that it's too short! I managed to complete this game in a single day (I'm not kidding). Partly because the puzzles in this game are very similar to puzzles I've seen in other games. Now if you're a casual gamer, then chances are you're probably going to be playing this game much longer then I would. Overall, Morphopolis is a very well designed game that I wish could have a sequel or an expansion pack. If you like Professor Layton or any other puzzle game in general, give this one a try.","March 8","true","4.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tabascofanatikerin/recommended/314020/","tabascofanatikerin","Tabascofanatikerin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tabascofanatikerin/","210 products in account","The game "Morphopolis" is a pretty little, short puzzle/hidden objects game that builds on a relaxing atmosphere in a natural, colourful environment (to be more exact: the world of insects).\nIn five levels you take control of an insect trying to get to the end of the level but a row of obstacles get in your way. To get rid of them you need to solve a few puzzles or find a certain amount of objects (which is more challenging than it sounds considering the detailed backgrounds you have to look at to find the objects).\n\nWhat's nice is that the game is quite relaxing which is because of the soothing easy-listening soundtrack and the design which make you feel you're in some sort of jungle right now.\n\nYou won't get any help in the game on what a puzzle is about but most of the time it's easy to find out. Only the very last puzzle in level 5 is very tricky.\nAside from the lack of game help in the game, it can get very annoying when the screen moves and you have to way until the next screen slowly appears (because your insect moves slowly, too).\n\nSo if you like a short puzzle/hidden objects game for about 1-2 hours and if you don't dislike insects, feel free to entertain yourself. But because it's so short, better keep your eyes open for a discount offer instead of paying full 4,99 € for this game.","September 6, 2015","true","3.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TenshiOkamiLove/recommended/314020/","TenshiOkamiLove","Tenshi Okami","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TenshiOkamiLove/","64 products in account","This game is actually really interesting. It’s a beautiful piece of art with high details and bright colors. No, I am not talking about a painting; I’m talking about the game although the game is like a painting in a way. It has a very calming feel that helps you relax as you try to work out the puzzles and find the items in which you’re looking for. It’s a very short game, only about an hour or two depending on how good you are at puzzles and hidden object games. Behind the puzzles and artwork, we have an interesting sort of story that is abstract enough for you to take what you want from it. It is one of those games that might have a deeper meaning if you really want to look for it.\n\nThey don’t really explain a story line for the game much, you are thrust straight into the game as a little larva or caterpillar wiggling around. It keeps you in that insect world as you go from a small larva to a grasshopper to a bee and so on. There aren’t any times that you actually fly or jump which is kind of strange but you walk around gathering items and the end of the stage is crawling into what looks like a carcass of the bug you will be next. I know the game is called morphopolis and is supposed to be about metamorphosis but this feels more like you taking over the dead bug instead.\n\nThe game play is… at times its pretty good when you get into the puzzles but the movement of the character walking around is a little hard to deal with. Times when I am clicking to find the objects, the little character that I was playing would move and go into a different scene when I am not ready for it. That’s the problem with clicking the screen being both for finding items and moving your character. There are times when my character also had trouble finding the pathways I wanted him to go on.  I think it would have been a bit easier if they had the arrow keys to move the character as I could hit the down button or up to go on those paths. The character moves very slowly which can make that part of the game boring when you have to go back and forward to collect items. There is a lot of back tracking in this and it would have been nice to be able to have the character speed up. There is one other problem that I do have with the puzzles. The puzzles don’t tell you how to do them, you sort of just have to try different things to figure it out. There was one puzzle I got stuck on because nothing I did was actually working that I had to look up what the puzzle was supposed to be so I could play it.\n\nThe artwork is so amazing. It’s very high detail and is almost like a surreal painting with how playful the colors and designs are. The problem with this though is that there are times you can’t find the path you need to go on most of the time. The paths just blend in with the background or are really hard to figure out. They luckily have it so that when you click your character, a couple green sparkles will resonate from him and travel a little way along the path though sometimes its hard to see depending on how high detailed the area is around them. On the other hand, the high detail does make finding the objects your looking for all the more rewarding as it is hard to see them.\n\nThe music is so calming and a little mysterious. There is one track through the whole thing and yet I never got bored of it. It’s a piano solo that almost put me to sleep a couple of times during the long walk parts. That is all I can really say on it as its just calming.\n\nOverall, it was a nice little game to play. Is it worth the money that it is on steam right now? Maybe not. I got the game on a steam sale and It was worth the amount I paid for but I’m not sure if it’s the full $4.99 worth. My recommendation is to get it on sale because it is a good game, and it is beautiful. If you get it for the normal price, then you’re mostly paying for the artwork.","September 6, 2015","true","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Get it cheap, it might be worth your time, but that is a very short time. A good portion of the time I spent in this game, I was distracted texting my girlfriend. It's kinda like a really pretty game of I Spy, but it's really over very quickly, and some of the features aren't very intuitive. For instance, to solve one puzzle you have to collect several of what I assume to be little pebbles of food. To find them,  you have to move your insect to little pods on the branch, and click on your insect to make the green particle thing happen. Either that, or you click (and drag, maybe) on the pods to open them.  Here's the thing that really disappointed me at the end of the game: I found out there was card drops. I have no motivation to play the game to actually collect them! I got one, but I don't even want to play the game again to get the other two, because it's done, there's no more adventure, and I'm just not interested. If you get the game on sale and cheap, fine, play it, enjoy the visuals and music, it's nice.

I got it on sale a while back. I will tell you why I did not think it was worth even that price.\n\nYou play as a bug growing and changing along the way at the same pace of something very slow. Really, really slow. Even animations would take their time. I would say if the movement and animation was not so slow, I would be able to finish it in half the time it took me. Probably even less, I did AFK for a little. Moving the bug around also sucked. Sometimes it would go in one direction or the other. Accidentally moving to another scene/area happened often.\n\nPersonally, I found the music in Morphopolis okay. Not terrible at all.\n\nThe puzzles, as some people stated, can be hard. I did not have a ton of difficulty myself, but others were annoyed that there is no reset button.\n\nAlthough I thought the game looked nice, the art style made it hard to see what I had to do. This game might be hard for someone that had a colour blindness. OR maybe not, I am not colour blind. I cannot say for sure.\n\nSo the game design isn't super great. Going through the menus and not understanding what the buttons did could be my fault. I accidentally went back to the menu in the middle of a level. I don't believe that there will be updates in the future to fix/change anything.\n\nI do not think I will ever replay this game. Going through the levels and puzzles will just annoy me again. I am not saying you cannot replay it, but there will not be anything you missed the first time. Unless there is some easter egg I am not aware of.\n\nIf you like "art" you will probably like this game. Or if you like casual, slow paced game play. But not too casual because you will have a hard time finding the hidden object. Do you also love puzzles? Hard puzzles? Music? Sound effects? Bad menus? Little to no directions? Slow motion creepy crawlies? Then you should definitely get this game when it's on sale.","August 11, 2015","false","1.3"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","1"

Get it cheap, it might be worth your time, but that is a very short time. A good portion of the time I spent in this game, I was distracted texting my girlfriend. It's kinda like a really pretty game of I Spy, but it's really over very quickly, and some of the features aren't very intuitive. For instance, to solve one puzzle you have to collect several of what I assume to be little pebbles of food. To find them,  you have to move your insect to little pods on the branch, and click on your insect to make the green particle thing happen. Either that, or you click (and drag, maybe) on the pods to open them.  Here's the thing that really disappointed me at the end of the game: I found out there was card drops. I have no motivation to play the game to actually collect them! I got one, but I don't even want to play the game again to get the other two, because it's done, there's no more adventure, and I'm just not interested. If you get the game on sale and cheap, fine, play it, enjoy the visuals and music, it's nice.

The game itself has some hiccups to work through, though.\n\nFirst of all, the game was designed for a touch screen, and it shows. The all mouse interface is functional, but not ideal. While finding things through the world is fine, the use of the mouse for movement is clunky and can definitely start to grate after a while, especially as you slowly move up and down and back and forth across the levels. Some of the puzzles likewise feel a bit clunky which can push a challenging puzzle over the brink into frustrating. The puzzles themselves are fine, nothing too wild and probably variations of things you've seen before. That's not bad, just know that it's nothing groundbreaking.\n\nThe game itself is made up of I spy hunts for various items, puzzles, and the occasional interaction with the environment. Again, nothing earth shattering, but functional enough to keep things interesting. Most of the gameplay is made up of hunting for the items on the screen with puzzles being the reward for finding them. Again, these aren't bad things, but don't expect an insect version of Broken Sword.\n\nThe game is definitely worth playing if you find the art style intriguing. That's what drew me in, and it definitely delivered on that count. The gameplay is nothing to write home about, but with the art and presentation draped over it, it works.\n\n","June 30, 2015","true","3.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I certainly had a bit of a nostalgia hard-on while playing this game, full disclaimer on that one.\n\nI'd certainly say Morphopolis is quite therapeutic (unless you hate bugs), it has calming music, a vibrant environment that somehow feels huge, empty, and filled to the brim at the same time through its artistic use of the whole bug-world. There are plenty of times where you'll feel like the game is moving way too slow, and you will be stumped heavily on a puzzle or two here and there, perhaps to a point of rage, but in the end it makes you feel more accomplished. There even is a noticable progression between levels which gives you an air on familiarity in a new, strange environment.\n\nIn the end, the game doesn't take too long to beat. But the apprehension and depiction of the whole game makes it feel longer, it gives you a feeling of being accomplished and completed. It's not a wonderful, 10/10 game, but for someone who's willing to take the time and mild frustration to complete the game, it can be a nice gaming/art experience.\n\nIs ok.","December 29, 2015","true","2.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I say that because I believe for this particular game the art is the priority.  That's not to say there isn't interaction but its gameplay is quite simple.  I'd go as far to say that the gameplay is designed to make sure you focus on and absorb the art.  The eye candy is nice but it takes more then that to design a good game.\n\nIn Morphopolis you play as different bugs who are kind enough to help out there neighbors with different chores.   Then at the end of each stage it appears you transfer yourself into a larger bug whom you'll play as in the following stage.  There isn't any written story instead the game leaves it up to you to interrupt the meaning behind you're actions.  Even beyond story-telling there isn't even guides to tell you where to go or what to do.  Restricted movement and actions is enough to let you figure out for yourself what you need to accomplish.\n\nThis game is super stylized.  The consistency of the art work between each stage is spot on.  The stages split across multiple screens which connect seamlessly.  The art is this Morphopolis is stunning.  The paintings are incredible and make you really focus when trying to find the objects you need.  You'll be looking at every little detail as your eyes slowly inspect the image.\n\nEssentially, this is a find the objects game.  As you play you'll come across particular plants and bugs that stick out from the backgrounds.  Each of them will ask you to find a set amount of particular items for them.  You'll need to carefully scan the backgrounds and gather up all the items.  Then proceed to deliver them in order to clear a path or initiate a special mini-game puzzle.  All the puzzles are very different and I believe this is were Morphopolis loses it consistency.  Until this point the game is fairly easy and relaxing but a couple of the puzzles are incredibly challenging.  This very bizarre difficulty curve takes you out of what is otherwise an immersive and enjoyable game.\n\nVery stylized and original, the only thing holding this game back from is it's struggle balancing.  If you think this might be a game you'll enjoy don't let that hold you back.  That being said I'm sure some people will really enjoy that added challenge.  Those who are worried about getting frustrated can always minimize the game a bring up walk-through for the really tough puzzles.  As I said before art is at the core of this game.  This is an array of visual stimulation that will let you relax and lose yourself in the world.

While I'm not typically a fan of the find-the-thing game category, this one was beautiful.  It's exotic, innocent, the art is great and the music matches it exquisitely.  I feel like I ripped them off for paying so little.  It's only good for maybe an hour or two of actual play time but good god it's fun while it lasts.  The only downside, and I say this with no disparagement, is that some of the puzzles are not self-evident.  This isn't usually too much of a condemnation except that the game provides virtually no instructions at any point.  Of course, there's Google.  If you're at an absolute loss, do that.  There's a brief how to move sequence at the very beginning and the rest is up for you to figure out.  That being said, just get it.  It's so cheap.  There's really no way to go wrong with this one.  Even if it was just an art and music pack without a game at all it'd still be worthwhile.  If I can pay a dollar for over an hour of childlike wonder then I just won and that's exactly what Morphopolis brings to the table in the most beautiful, multicoloured and delightful way possible.  It's such a beautifully and richly put together game that I can't recommend it enough.","February 4","true","3.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is a piece of art teeming with detail and depth. The game, on the other hand, is simple and short. It took me about 2.3 hours to complete all five stages (my additional time played was to get the rest of my card drops). I wouldn't say there is any story in the traditional sense, but there is definitely a depth to the game tapping into the micro/macrocosm that can let the player think about the environment they are playing in or just become immersed in the beautiful backgrounds. The actual puzzles are interesting and varied, but it would have been nice to see more of them per stage. I bought this when it was on sale for 19 cents and it was absolutely worth it. If you are looking for a short point and click-puzzle hybrid, then you should give this a try.","July 11, 2015","true","2.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

That's basically me selling two steam trading cards.\n\nThe feeling the game gives off... I don't how many of you remember "The Very Hungry Caterpillar," but it invokes that same kind of nostalgic blast of color, something that mesmerizes you.  It is more than ten times as bright and vivid as that book, but as adults that's what it takes to overload your senses.  At the same time there is an ever-present sensation of faded-ness.  Like the bright colors are constantly waning and all your efforts is only leading you to the end of both the game and your buggy life.\n\nThe game play is nothing special.  It is just a point and click with a few puzzles.\n\nNote:  Screw the beetle lock!  That took me half an hour.  That's 25% of the time spent on this game wasted on a bland rock with five bugs on it!","July 16, 2015","true","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Yes, I would just say wait till its on special though. I did enjoy my time with it. It was fairly easy, a god little time killer without being too full on. Just click and point to make your bug move, and collect the objects. Every now and then you'll have to do a puzzel (jump the seeds, make a puzzle, etc)\n\nThe graphics are cute and the music is nice. However, the music gets really reptitive fast. I also did not finish - I gave up on level 5 with the bug body spinning thing. But, the controls were "buggy" (lol) and my little bug often got stuck (worst bits were level 4 with the branch in front of the bug guarding the hole, and level 5 going either up the wall or down into the cave).","March 26","true","1.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But it's a pretty (and short) little puzzle game that will make you look around and explore the jungly bug-land that it's set in. You should be armed with patience, a clever mind, a pair of glasses and a younger sibling/kid to help you out, just in case. (If you have none of those, a cat, an owl or a toad would work, too, I guess.)\n\nI'd say it's worth the 99 cents you'd pay for it (or definitely worth the 33 cents, if you got it on sale).

I had to give up when I encountered the last puzzle. Was too hard to overcome for me. But will I come back sometime to finish what I started? Indeed I think so.\n\nMorphopolis is very simple game. You only need to click at certain objects in order to move "story" forward. It uses oldschool mechanics from simillar games, so it is not innovative at any point. I have a feeling that it is specially designed to be longer than it had to be. You will often find yourself wandering around the same locations just to pick a mushroom that you couldn't pick last time you were there. Also game is very short in it's core "story".\n\nBut Morphopolis is beautiful. Really. And has so relaxing and nice music. It is great way to spend 2/3 hours. Not more though, unless you won't be bored doing the same thing over and over again.\n\nI can easily recommend this game and give it 7/10.\nPro:\n- price\n- graphics\n- music\n- concept\nCon:\n- too short\n- takes too much space\n- is designed to be longer than it should be","April 4","true","2.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
