"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BertieWooster/recommended/343370/","BertieWooster","William Shakesman","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BertieWooster/","1089 products in account","I played Slammed on mobile, loved it so much I bought it again on a device that I can actually read reliably, and then quickly took to a review to extoll its virtues.\n\nSlammed has your character rise from an no-name indie star to the top match at the biggest PPV at the biggest professional promotion. The story is written with heart and charm and genuine love of wrestling. With a brilliant little cheat on the part of the author (Matches are sometimes real and sometimes scripted), you have a game where everything can be on the line in a fight, and in another situation you might meet the aging veteran who never had the push he deserved or the tacky, unprofessional wrestler who takes issue with the booking. This could have ended up being a disastrous attempt to merge both the magic of kayfabe and the grit behind the curtain, but the writer pulls it off wonderfully.\n\nEven better, there aren't just several endings, there are at least three different whole final scenarios depending on your choices, a few secret endings here and there, multiple romances to pursue, there is some replayability here.\n\nI only have a couple of complaints about the game and they both stem from it being a standard Choice of Games game. First, there are no save slots. Pure auto-save. There are good branching scenarios throughout the whole game so replaying is not a pain, but several ending variants are determined entirely by your actions in the last three or so chapters. There are not many dead ends but you can lose the big matches and have to replay the whole story for a less unsatisfying ending. (Fairly quick if you have read it all before, thankfully.)\n\nSecond, Choice of Games shoehorns in their pet device where you can be any sex and pursue any sex, but these games are not Mass Effect in which you can lard up the game with a dozen cheesy romances of every orientation. The result is characters get gender bent and FEEL gender bent if you pick an unnatural (respective to the writing) orientation. Slammed does pull this off better than other Choice of Games games. The womens league wrestlers all get their own descriptions so even the ones that perform the same role as they would for a male player character still feel like their own characters and there is a really cute story path that is appropriately open only to female characters. But there's one specific love interest in Slammed who is either a charming feminine woman or a kinda weird feminine man. It's a small complaint overall though.","January 30, 2015","true","0.3"," 28 of 33 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","28","33","0","2"

Even then, you'll probably miss a lot of references and easter eggs if you are not familiar with how american indie federations work because "it's not just two guys pretending to punch each others in underwear", like Y2J Chris Jericho once said, it's a much deeper world and it's great.\n\nThat said, Slammed is an awesome game/ interactive novel. Still havent finished it, but for now is very well written. All the choices are interesting and you really get to play as you want throughout the story, choosing between different styles of both in-ring atittude and real lifestyle. As some other user said, the concept of Keyfabe used a stat is fascinating. The story itself is cool and takes you through the struggles of a young man/woman who tries to make a name for HIm/herself in the indipendent circuit.\nA lot of references to the real wrestling world are spread throughout the story and they won't fail to make you smile at times: the Adjective Era instead of the Attitude Era, the option to "oversell" a match (lol) and others that I wont spoil.\n\nStrongly recommended.","May 25","true","0.8"," 22 of 23 people (96%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","96","22","23","0","2"

The writing is solid all around, and it's worth noting that it attempts to be accessible to non-wresting aficionados too by providing little explanations of wrestling lingo at times, though it's probably not quite enough for the entirely uninitiated. Keep your search engine of choice at the ready if that is the case for you, and you'll be a-okay.\n\nIt branches plenty, about as much as you'd expect from a Choice of game. If I was left wanting more, it is more a testament to the quality of the game (and my fascination with the sport, to be perfectly fair) than a judgement on how much content there is.\n\nVery much recommended; it's the wrestling adventure most savvy fans dream of, and unique in what it does to the genre. I wish "traditional" wrestling games were more like this.","October 14, 2015","true","16.0"," 15 of 15 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","15","15","0","0"

If you enjoy interactive fiction, you’ll still find a great story with interesting characters and a TON of character choice and different routes for replayability.\n\nFor those of you that are or have been fans, however,  you have the added bonus of enjoying loads of in-jokes and references that will make you smile – maybe even a few laugh out loud moments too – and have fun matching the game’s characters to the people they are actually based on. It’s always nice when a writer has such a grasp on and love for the material he is writing as the game’s quality can only be strengthened by it. Not only is it a great read, but it is a fictionalized walk through memory lane. (It is kind of sad to play as a female wrestler, though, as the fictional divas division is certainly better handled than the real one :p )\n\nTldr; Slammed is a lengthy CYOA of rising to fame in the GWA. There are many ways to make it, and more than a few ways to fail; do your skills have what it takes to make you the next HBK or Stone Cold?\n","January 30, 2015","true","5.1"," 21 of 29 people (72%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","72","21","29","0","2"

I'm not an active fan but this made me want to return to my childhood days and enjoy it all.\n\nThis game was made by a master of terminology and theory of the genre. I played a heel through almost the whole game and just twice I broke kayfabe, once to sign a fan an autograph [if they said I was a jerk about it haha, I was nice to them.] and also to a woman who had some problem with family or something.\n\nThis is a great story and I only played once. It certainly levels with the standard highest bar I place for CoG, which is Choice of Robots [my fave story wise and sheer "yes you can do that, and it will have a real effect."]. I might not like pro wrestling as much as Robots, I love this game for the same reasons.\n\nI can't quite figure out some stats, maybe they effect wording or story path with no choice involved [except the choices that gave you those stats.] My story path definitely satisfied even if there is only one main path. I felt the sting of every revelation and the confusion of "Is this kayfabe? Or do I have to kick some ♥♥♥?" I got so into it that in game I started to accidently handicap myself thinking I'd end up having to seriously fight bloody.\n\nIf you don't know wrestling terms, the game makes them sorta contextual, but if there isn't an in game dictionary of terms, there is a good free online one.\n\nGood weaving in and out of the timeline to help have you choose things and establish in-game reality. Since at times it'll weave forward or back through time There aren't many, or any, awkward sudden choices to make.\n\nFinally, now and then you get to read a news type blog post about you and what's happening in your corner of wrestling.\n\nJust a lot of fun. Damn good story, you don't just choose how it goes, but like wrestling.... you tune it like a song also","October 19, 2015","true","2.1"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

You mold your own personality either if you're the fan favorite or the infamous villain. You choose your own wrestling style, your "FRIENDS", your TRUE "FRIENDS". The story will throw you to the point of whether you should show the REAL you or keep the character mask you're playing. You'll also be given a choice of whether you'll make the match turn to a real beatdown fight or an entertaining match.\n\nJust always remember that in wreslting, "Sometimes, you need to lose in order to win."\n\nIf you're a big wresling fan and you want a much better storyline than that of what the WWE makes today? Then you should try SLAMMED!. And don't worry, SLAMMED! is more likely part of the Attitude Era of the WWE. After playing this game, you'll realize how crappy the WWE's storylines are today.\n\nMusic: n/a (there are no music and sounds, it's purely text-based)\nGameplay: n/a (you just choose what choice you'll take-based)\nGraphics: n/a (there are no graphics, it's purely text-based)\nStory: 10/10\n\nMy Overall Rating: 10/10\n\nNOTE: This game is purely text-based and if you are interested in a novel type approach (like ebooks), then this is a game for you.","March 14, 2015","true","12.4"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","6","7","0","0"

The author is very clearly a passionate fan of pro wrestling, and shows a deep knowledge of how the industry works. Even if you don’t like wrestling, you’ll like Slammed if you’re a fan of Interactive Fiction. The game explains what you need to know about pro wrestling as it goes along, and has a great story that incorporates your choices and what kind of wrestler your character is. Without giving too much away, the moral dilemma near the end that sets up which final route you take was awesome and chilling. I played through this twice, and even on the second playthrough I couldn’t do what I would’ve had to do to get my championship match, and I’m okay with that.","July 1, 2015","true","25.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

You don't need to know or understand professional wrestling, although some terms are crucial to understand (ie, the concept of kayfabe) and a quick google search every now and then will help as you go along. At its core though, this is a story about your journey and the personalities that you interactive with - the wrestling is the backdrop for the most part.\n\nThe story's pacing is excellent, and the blurring of the line between real and kayfabe (which is broadly the same concept as the "fourth wall" in acting) is really well done. The quality of the writing, purely from the point of view of the storytelling, is also excellent. For me, the best example of this is the section that features the "promotional video" for the grand finale, where the writing got me genuinely pumped up for the big climax.\n\nThere is a reasonable amount of replayability - there are enough branching story arcs for you to play several times and not get bored of it.

Fealt like this was just a little too rated T/E 10+ and I was looking for something at least rated R...At least when it comes to a story about wrestling.\n\nI found myself too often being more intersted in the sweet silence of my room than the reading of this game.

Slammed is an interactive novel in the vain of choose your own adventure in which you assume the role of a pro wrestler. I had luke warm expectations for this going in. I guess I assumed that it would read like wrestling fan fiction, which I'm sure exists but have absolutely no interest in persuing. Instead, I was treated to an interactive adventure full of colorful characters, twists and turns that had me up late into the wee hours. I will definitely run through again to see what the alternate choices could have lead to.
