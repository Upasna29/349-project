The game is also very cheap, and trust me you get a lot for that 99 cents. Also the art style in this game is awesome. The gameplay is fun too, it feels really satisfying to trap the monsters behind boxes, This game is easy to run, cheap, beautiful and most of all fun.","June 6","true","0.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"
