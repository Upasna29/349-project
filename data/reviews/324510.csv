In short, my "old" review was still completely revelent besides 2 or 3 additions.\n\n► WHAT'S NEW?\n● GRAPHICS: Just before I quit playing Oort Online (Boundless' old title), the game had a texture swap that made it look a lot sharper at the cost of performance. It doesn't seem like they did anything for optimization from then to now which sucks because the already small community got a lot smaller when half of them couldn't run the game anymore.\n● SERVERS: Still laggy and have you teleport around a lot. Careful not to fall off your build.\n● COMMUNITY: Dead. This game has completely lost relevancy. Try looking up Boundless on YouTube.\n● CRAFTING: Last time I played, the basic crafting system was being implemented. It wasn't bad, but when they put it in you went from spawning with a ton of blocks to spawning with nothing and having to craft your blocks. No change from then to now besides the menu looking better.\n● COMBAT: "Enemy" creatures are new to me. You can fight them, but you just walk up to them and spam click until they die. They don't drop anything either, they only seem to increase the chances of being killed and losing all your blocks.\n● MOVEMENT: Running around is still the same.. sticky. Mostly because of lag. I'm really surprised how hard the Grappling Hook was nerfed though. You used to be able to hang from a block and shoot another rope WHILE hanging, but now your character simply let's go and starts falling with a short delay before you can shoot another rope.\n● RACES: I remember when "different playable races and perks" was all the devs talked about when I stopped playing. It was the next big feature they were working on and they even showed 3 different characters in a video that each played differently.\nLike most indie games, these characters never saw the light of day. You can pick how you character looks now, but that's it.\n● BUILDING: No improvements here. Building is worse then when I played because getting around takes longer (due to the nerfed grappling hook) and you have to craft all your blocks (you don't spawn with any).\n\nOort Online might be called Boundless now, but I still can't recommend it. Devs seemed to take all the money they earned so they could release the game on PS4. Maybe their publisher will push them to make a decent game.\nI don't like putting out negative reviews, but really.. play SkySaga, Trove or Minecraft instead.","December 5, 2014","false","51.4"," 570 of 746 people (76%) found this review helpful 19 people found this review funny","76","570","746","19","26"

As a developer myself, I understand that it takes quite a lot of vision, planning and strict quality control to create a game like this. I saw a high level of creativity (and consistency) along with a real dedication to quality and transparency in the game's forum. That was impressive and I knew this team could create something unique.\n\nAt the moment, the game itself is a ton of fun if you enjoy exploration and building. There's not currently a lot of the more advanced game play features like economy, farming, trade progression, etc. but I've learned a lot about what the team has planned for the near future and it looks very promising.\n\nThe latest big update included a much improved user experience, player models, expanded crafting, tool models, lighting fixes, expanded weather, etc. The game was already very beautiful and has only become more so.\n\nWith the recent announcement of support by Sony to make Boundless a PC and Playstation-only game, I'm excited to see where this team takes the game.","November 4, 2015","true","162.8"," 98 of 110 people (89%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","89","98","110","3","1"

I have already dicovered a lot of amazing creations from some really creative people. I have been spending most my time on RUCCIE.

What no one really gets is that voxel building games have morphed into their own category of game. This game is similar to minecraft in that there are blocks, and you mine / craft / build with those blocks. That's about where the similarity ends. Legitimately great games like this one get canned all the time just because they're voxel games, and I for one hope this one makes it through. Minecraft was a great game, but it also had it's flaws. This game fixes a lot of the complaints I had about minecraft, and then goes on to implement some amazing and promising systems.\n\nThe movement in this game is stellar, and that coupled with the amazing ambient sounds and whooshing that you get when you move fast makesan immersive feel that is pretty awesome. The smoothness of flying through the air on a grapling hook is amazing. The customizability of the terrain is another great feature of this game. There's a lot more options for great landscapes than there were in minecraft's procedurally generated stuff. Overall oort is already a better game than minecraft and deserves to reach fruition.\n\nThis game has a strong group of devs working very hard and pushing out new updates rapidly (and it looks completely gorgeous). That, more than anything else, is why i chose to buy this game in early access. There's a really nice feel to the game right now, and the community is great, mostly because of how responsive and interactive the devs are. That is why i feel this game will be here to stay, and will reach it's final form (which will be glorious). Buying in now will give you the opportunity to help sculpt this game into something amazing (even better than it already is)!","January 2, 2015","true","42.4"," 90 of 123 people (73%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","73","90","123","6","8"

This game feels more like a beta than alpha. When you start it for the first time you will be presented with a familiar list of servers but these are also different worlds.\n\nThis game has an epic exploration aspect because of how amazing and different the worlds are. As well as how beautiful its graphics are.\n\nAfter only 3.5 HRS I had to get the DLC. Because it was obvious that if development continues like this it will be EPIC.\n\n@ 40 HOURS\n\nLike the screnshots there is grass and tree leaves. It took me a while to realize how it  keeps me from having 8 bit flashbacks.\n\nI have spent most of my time building and even knowing they should wipe the server, I will enjoy it anyway. Something about raidng other worlds for rescources is logistic gaming goodness. I have done this many time in many games but when I look up from my work out across the patches of land and  lava. I see the other sky islands with clumps of purple glowing blocks on the undersides and watch a glorious sun/moon rise/set. Just building anything becomes satisfaction enough.\n\nDevelopment continues with frequent updates. With the same thought and quality as currently in the game. Which brings me to the games only major problem. So far what we have is well developed. The updates are exciting for what they are and how they show what the game will become. Its problem is that it cannot come fast enough regardless of the time it takes.\n\nThe funniest thing about this game so far is that OORT was possibly obscure but after playing feels like the right name.","April 8","true","43.2"," 39 of 49 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","39","49","2","1"

If you want to say this is a "Minecraft clone" ok sure i can understand that, but know that it's not a ripoff, cheap, money grab game, this is as legit as it gets from a "Minecraft clone" , heck it's doing stuff 10x more awesome than Minecraft. Now that's out of the way...\n\nIt's in pre-alpha, so a lot of bugs, optimisation issues, not all the content is there...etc, and the price is really high to get it now, in the pre-alpha, but that's going way down once it's released, so I'm just going to talk about the my thoughts of the game with no consideration of the price at the moment, if you want to get in go ahead, but if i had to say realistically, it's not worth getting 'now' for the asking price, would say at the beta stage is a good start.[Update: thought the price was 100$ for 35, if you that's a reasonable price to get in now, so im going to say 'no and yes']\n\nSo anyway, the game looks absolutly gorgeous, just look at the pictures and videos. The sound effects were recently added in and it sounds just great. The build part is as nice as the game, and adds detail to it's 'blocks' by making it so you can have a triangle, a slope, some other shapes i don't know what's the name of, and it still has its simplicity in building. There's also blocks with effects, like a bouncing block, slippery block..etc.\n\nAlso the portal system in this game is just mind blowingly awesome, where you see a portal in the world, and look through that portal you see another world (another server) in real time, and you go in, in that second you go in, your in another world, in another server that's on the other side of the planet.\n\nAlso the addition to hooks in the game is really awesome, aside from the awesome swings you can do with it, it really helps you reach high places with such ease, you don't have to put a block over a block and continue doing it to reach a certain hight of where you fell from. The hook, at this point on, is an essential for me to build.\n\nThere's a lot more i can talk about, and obviously there's bad parts about the game, but so far that's been technical problems as mentioned in the beginning, and i can't wait until the game reachs beta to launch, to me this is my next innovative and definitive 'Minecraft'.\n\nShameless link[www.ksalue.com]","November 13, 2014","true","4.9"," 62 of 89 people (70%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","70","62","89","3","5"

Coming in, I was really expecting another minecrap clone, but while at first glance that's what it is, it has a distinctly different feel to it. There are a lot of fun concepts and mechanics present that set it apart from any other games in this rapidly expanding genre.\n\nHere's what I noticed in my first hour or so into the game:\nThe first thing anyone will notice when playing this is the most obvious; the graphics.\nThe visuals can be incredible, and somewhat surreal at times, but while they look nice, in all honesty it can get to a point where it slightly hurts the eyes, and can get very distracting. This is honestly one of my biggest irritations with the game, aside from the next point;\nHarvesting materials is infuriatingly tedious. I spent what felt like over 30 minutes harvesting one tree, simply because I had to spend so long trying to clear the floating leaves out.\nThere's a lot, and I mean a LOT of bugs. I found an infinite wood exploit entirely by accident, and it was executed through what should be a normal part of building.(Note to the developers: Ancient Wood Slabs, yo.)\nThe servers are GHOST TOWNS. I have yet to even see another player, this entire time. I mean, their structures are omnipresent, but the players themselves? Gone with the wind. HOWEVER...\nNow, while all of this is glaringly irritating, something that struck me as odd was that after all that, I realized I was still playing. It took me a moment, but I realized that the game was so damn addicting, even without other players, or properly functioning wooden slabs, it was still amazingly fun.\n\nI've tried to organise why.\nThe entire idea of random portals sitting in the middle of nowhere leading to the middle of nowhere is absolutely brilliant. The fact that transitions between both sides is seamless is even more brilliant, and helps really immerse you into the world, as instead of just switching servers, (which you could do anyways IF YOU HATE FUN) you can instead choose to use a portal, seamlessly jumping from one server to the next without even so much as a loading screen. You can even see the place from the other side. It adds a lot to the game.\nThe whole concept of a number of the technical blocks is a lot of fun. The bounce.. jump... trampoline... things... are great fun to play with... assuming you can find a good place to set it all up.\n\nThe ambience is absolutely wonderful.\nNot really much to say about that one. It just works.\n\nOf all the things I saw that people had built, I sincerely did not see even ONE gigantic ♥♥♥♥, not a single phallic obelisk piercing the heavens, the world was DEVOID of grand towering ding-dongs, plenty of ships but barren of mainsails, lots of afros and not one disco stick, stones all over the place but no excalibur, CLUBS WERE OPEN AND NOT A MEMBER IN SIGHT.\nNot. Even. One.\n\nIt was amazing.\n\nWhoops, I didnt keep it short.\n\ntl;dr:\nBuggy, visuals can make your eyes hurt, nobody playing it, still super fun, and has brilliant ideas and mechanics.\n\nAnd no giant ♥♥♥♥♥.\n\nNO GIANT ♥♥♥♥♥.\n\nANYWHERE.\n\nI rate it 8.5/10.","March 29, 2015","true","2.4"," 65 of 95 people (68%) found this review helpful 27 people found this review funny","68","65","95","27","0"

That's a very nice change of pace, considering how a lot of games have been going the past few years.\n\nAlso, the game is a lot of fun even in the earliest stages.

At the moment there is only building and exploring with friends or by yourself if you prefer to be the lone wolf. As limited as the game may currently be, it is very worth the purchase now to get involved with the game early on, find and report bugs (they are out there....Alpha people!) build some amazing structures with buddies! and grow with this game as it updates and changes before your eyes!.\n\nThe Dev team constantly updates and pushes for game growth, they are also extremely active with their Oortian community!. Steam, Facebook, Twitter, their official site and forums to email, they are very active and actually respond to questions or concerns if any.\n\nI highly recommend purchasing this game sooner than later and heres why: Early Access!, Bonuses to the game (depending on which Oort Package you decide is for you..check their official website), Buying now all helps to ensure this game continues to develop smoothly which is what we all want dont we!? ;).\n\nVery promising game, and we all can make it come to have a full and happy life.","December 8, 2014","true","328.3"," 32 of 48 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","32","48","2","0"

Just as the Investors are shaping the game, we, the Playerbase, must take steps forward to shape the community.\n\nNow enough on that matter, what can you expect from Oort at it's current stage?\n\n>A Beautiful Voxel-rendered world already populated with a variety of Player-created structures, monuments and wonders, some of which can be seen day and night.\n>All the basic tools you'd expect from a voxel rendered sandbox, with a full library of fun function blocks like "ice" and "bounce" that allow you to create some truly marvellous slides, personal rollercoasters and trampoline or jump pads.\n>Actually fun traversal tools like the Grappling Hook (which can be spammed to your hearts content to rapidly ascend cliffs and ridges) which can actually be utilized like a grappling hook and allow you to swing about the world gracefully...\n>And so, so much more in the near future.\n\nWhat not to expect at the moment?\n>Beacons to protect your plots or creations (Hopefully this'll be changed very, very soon)\n>Monsters\n>Character models\n>And basically a complete or even beta 'game'.\n\nThis game's in Early Access for a reason, you could say it's Proto-Alpha, but it's still surprisingly presentable even then.\n\nHopefully I'll change this review as time and progress goes on, but I truly look forward to the Finished Product (Estimated: Late 2015)","November 13, 2014","true","3.3"," 17 of 25 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","17","25","0","0"

I never know where my adventures are going to take me, whether it's hopping from floating island to floating island over large lava lakes to underwater spelunking to swinging through a forest like Tarzan trying not to go "splat".\n\nEven with such a small team (compared to other games of this scope), the game runs with very few bugs and any issues are taken care of very quickly.  The development team is incredibly transparent and as devoted to their game as their backers are.\n\nNote that it is a sandbox game, so if you're looking for someone to hold your hand and tell you what to do, maybe find something else.  But if you're excited about conquering worlds and being free to "do you", look no further as Boundless will offer that and more in the future.

Keeping that in mind, it's completely playable as it is. So far the building mechanics work great and everything is pretty much bug free. I have built a few biggish things now and haven’t run into any issues. The crafting interface is still somewhat new, so the system isn’t as smooth as it could be yet but it is coming along nicely and is still completely functional.\n\nVariety -  There are some pretty incredible landscapes and everything is varied between worlds, from the color of the grass to the shape of the mountains. So if you ever wanted a glowing wizard tower on top of a giant spiral mountain with purple grass… well there’s probably already a perfect place for that. Everything is so damn pretty!\n\nUpdates - I have seen people complain about their frequency or speed but I don’t get it, I have been satisfied with the progress. Textures and lighting have been reworked, character models and creatures have been introduced, new tools and tweaks to building mechanics, a UI overhaul, and probably a lot more that I forgot. So while survival aspects and epic battles might be awhile, they have been creating a pretty solid foundation for everything in the meantime. Also - considering some of the recent announcements it appears things will only speed up from here.\n\nPrice - It is more than most EA games, but as the devs explained - “A higher price point attracts people who *really* want to try the game and participate in the development/community.”  This is probably a key reason the community has been so great, the cost itself is a deterrent for the undesireables. Even those that are waiting for more content to play are constantly giving feedback, sharing ideas, and helping shape the game. The forum is flooded with constructive suggestions rather than complaints coming from people who just bought an unfinished game because it was cheap, so good ideas might actually be heard!\n\nI highly recommend this game, but only to a certain crowd (in its current state). If you just want to “buy a game” and aren’t interested in supporting development then you probably shouldn’t buy anything early access, but this one might still be worth checking out if you’re a builder.","November 3, 2015","true","356.7"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

As i was playing Don't Starve, my friend messaged me saying i would hate him (since i don't like people buying me things) and he had bought me Oort Online. I figured now would be my chance to see if the game was worth it.\n\nWhen i opened up Oort it ran in a small window and opened another window asking me to register, i figured it would be some quickly thrown together windowed game. When i finished my registration it bloomed into full screen and i was welcomed with a server choosing screen after selecting to play. I never saw so much variety in a singe game before when it came to servers, i thought it only hosted in Australia and the UK at first, but then i saw the scroll down button (more like a page down button, something to consider for the devs). When i found a suitable server and i entered, i had to take a moment before actually learning the controls to take in the beautiful atmosphere. The vibrant, mixed layout of the sky! The squared off terrain was normal but i couldnt help but notice.. it looked more natural, upon closer looks i saw that the terain molded differently and some had slopes, complimenting the terrain! All around beautiful for terrain. Then, i looked to my inventory bar, a grappling hook immediately, very useful in further travels.\n\nAside from missing player models and no music heard ingame, this is a very well put together game, so far it looks like it could be in beta already if the devs loaded in the player textures right now. I can't wait to see what awaits me on Oort Online, i'd love to see the model ideas, maybe a choice between a male and female model and some customization of that character like clothing, from the art i've seen of the devs i can tell they're going to put forth a lot of effort!","March 11, 2015","true","3.8"," 20 of 32 people (63%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","63","20","32","2","3"

Read the dev page: If you like what you see and want to contribute to the community. Get in. Either through Steam or www.playboundless.com.\nIf you are looking for a fully functional and immersive sandbox RPG MMO; put it on your wishlist and wait. It isn't there yet.I've never posted a review before, and I've put this off until now because, honestly, until update 112, I couldn't defend or justify a recommendation. This is not to say I wouldn't have recommended it before, just that it wouldn't have really helped anyone.\n\nI've been "playing" Boundless for over a year. I started back when it was Oort Online and first released to Steam. From the beginning I saw the potential and fell in love with the "vision", rough as it was. I went to the dev sites and read their plans. I understood that they released it not so much as an "early access game" but rather as a means to support a really cool vision of a game... and I hoped I was right, that it would come to fruition. I have not been disappointed in my investment.\n\nI believe the developers are taking the time to do this right. This isn't your typical "early access, get a deal on an almost ready game (Beta)". This was released to Steam when it was merely a prototype and a dream. It is now pre-alpha, and is starting to take shape.\n\nThe developers have steadily put out updates, and the team is continuing to grow. The game is steadily coalescing.\n\nIt is currently a beautiful building sandbox, with a few creatures, a spiffy inventory system, some crafting, one playable race (in first and third person) and lots of potential. I currently rarely see another player (except on the forums).\n\nBasically, I'm saying "Yes, I paid a lot. Yes, it is really early and there isn't a ton of stuff to do yet... but I keep coming back to it. It is gorgeous. I've spent HOURS building. I LOVE the community and its quirky "spirit" and am anticipating EVERY "next update" to see what it holds. This in itself is an adventure, and I consider it well worth what I paid. If you'd like to experience the same, welcome aboard!"\n\nBut this isn't really a recommendation for a game is it? It is a recommendation for a community and an experience.\n\nIf you want to skip to the end... you live for PVP or PVE, want to experience an active RPG MMO, you'll probably be disappointed right now.","November 10, 2015","true","562.1"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","1"

The servers are VERY quiet at the moment because the people havent rearlised what the game has become along with the new title. I only know from my email shouting at me and now i have got a good 7 extra hrs and i will continue to play. there are creatures now, there is a crafting system, bows, tools, and more versions of the grapple hook i belive... it has finally on the road to becoming the the game i hoped it would. it isnt yet worth the money its at for me, but whoever wants a game to walk around just to witness the stunning visuals. this is the game for you in its current alpha stage, the game will open to all as it develops.\nGG","October 25, 2015","true","9.0"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/XtrakrispyR/recommended/324510/","XtrakrispyR","XKPRiggz","http://steamcommunity.com/id/XtrakrispyR/","38 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nSo my recommendation comes with some good and some not-so-good:\n\nFirst the good:\n\nThe concept is awesome. If this game meets all the promises made by the devs, it will be the best voxel game on the market. Period. Look at the concept art. Look at the dev pipeline. Multiple races and classes, magic weapons and items, giant roving baddies, and a full crafting and voxel building system! We're talking elements of Minecraft, WoW, and Shadow of the Colossus all in one game.\n\nThe graphics are great!\n\nThe interconnected portals are a good approach to a multiserver based game. Each server is it's own biome, so inter portal travel will be an important part of the game to acquire certain resources or blocks.\n\nYou have a freaking grappling hook!\n\nThey recently added a chisel tool for the creation of shaped blocks. The system before was confusing and clunky. The tool makes it an actual physical interaction that grounds shaped blocks into the lore of the game.\n\nBackers get a say in the developement process through surveys about once a quarter.\n\nOk, now the not-so-good:\n\nThe asking price for the game is pretty high for the level of development it's at. I paid it, but I think the devs might get more backers if they made a couple of  pledge packages priced below the 35$ mark that still allowed access to the game. I think a lot of people are weary of paying a high cost for an incomplete game, especially with the risk of the devs abandoning the game.\n\nThere are NO models in the game except for 2-3 unanimated placeholder mobs and a torch; but no PC models (your toon is just an orange cude), tool models, or weapon models. Development on this game has been slow (none of the features I mentioned earier are actually IN the game yet) and while they release updates on regular basis, they are small (usually hotfixes) and don't really contain any major content changes.\n\nAs I said before, the graphics in the game are great, but nothing you can't get in MC with the right mods. Depth of field is way to shallow and I keep it turned off.\n\nNot really much to do at this point. Crafting is basically non-existant and there's no real adventure element as of now. You can walk around, use your grappling hook, mine some blocks and if you're really patient, you can create some cool stuff like you've seen in the videos. But I personally can't stay on for more than 10-20 minutes or so. It's an MMO, but the multiple servers mean that the people who are online are spread pretty thin, so it's unlikely to encounter another player.\n\nAll in all, this game shows a lot of promise and if you're a patient and committed backer who is excited about the vision of the game, then pay the money and get a say in the process. If you're impatient and want a complete game,  then look elsewhere or mod the hell out of Minecraft. As for me, I believe the devs are working as best as they can on this very ambitous project and I'll continue to check in from time to time and hope the funding picks up enough for them to hire a few more people to speed up the process.\n\n","July 22, 2015","true","8.5"," 21 of 35 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","21","35","0","0"

You might wander about aimlessly for a bit, wonder what to do and where the people are, and begin breaking blocks or exploring.\n\nThis game is in...\n\n...\n\nEARLY ACCESS! :D It's not even in Alpha! Which means there aren't a huge amount of things to do yet but build with some basic materials and fly around the world with a grappling hook. (PLEASE, try this! It's a great time, although you will die many times until you get the hang of it, and then die some more.)\n\nI purchased Boundless (Previously Oort Online) because I trusted the grand vision the developers at Wonderstruck had lain out for this game. They seemed to be fully on-board to work with the community and make Boundless the game they envisioned, and even more so. And they have! They are working daily, directly with the community to help them and gather feedback for upcoming features. And the community itself is extremely friendly and helpful! I wanted to say that I was a part of this community and this game from the beginning, as I see so much potential in it.\n\nI would suggest purchasing Boundless, but only if you are able to get past the fact that it is in Early Access, and has a lot planned for future updates. It'll feel a bit empty for now, but you can always find something to do!

Of course, these sound nothing more than scratches on the surface of the game, but it was a lot to us who have been here since the beginning.

My thoughts towards the game have not changed, and in fact my excitement for it has only increased. I can not state enough how much I love Boundless (for the same reasons below; the community, developers, the beauty, etc.).\n\nThe game has come a long way since its release to the public a year ago (in-browser game without audio, crafting, models, etc.):\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYxwj51opuk\nThe negative reviews about slow development completely puzzle me. Let's keep in mind this is an in-house engine too!\n\nAnyways, here's the original review!\n\n\n---------ORIGINAL REVIEW-----------\nOort is probably one of my favourite games over the past couple of years, and not necessarily because of what's in the game at the moment. The community is fantastic and the Devs are like no other. The team are always active on twitter and the Oort forums and are an amazing group of people.\n\nThe game is beautiful. If you like vanilla minecraft, I can guarantee you'll like this at its current stage. I struggle to go back to minecraft because of how dated it feels. Of course Oort has some huge things to come that will set it apart from other voxel games (Titans, Character levelling, HEAPS MORE).\n\nBefore you purchase, make sure you find out what is currently in game and what is still a planned feature, and therefore you wont be dissapointed. Most of the negative reviews on here are because of that exact reason. Do your homework (Watch some YouTube videos, Twitch streams, etc.) before purchasing.\n\nOh and about the pricing, look at their website. This works like a kickstarter campaign, except over a year instead. Youre paying $35USD to BACK the game and get access to early alpha/alpha/beta. If you want the full 1.0 game you can buy it now at $15USD and play at launch, or wait and pay $25USD-ish at launch. It's a little bit pricey for some good reasons (40+ Worlds/Servers, keeping the community small and dedicated, etc.).\n\nTo finish off, YES I reccomend this game, it's incredibly beautiful, runs really well on most systems (Unlike shaders on minecraft), the community is just fantastic, and Wonderstruck are amazing.","March 26, 2015","true","111.6"," 12 of 19 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","12","19","0","0"

If you're looking for a complete sandbox MMO, then you'll be disappointed right now; however, if you're looking for a unique, fun, engaging game, then this may be for you.\n\nIt's honestly difficult to say what has me hooked into Oort Online, there are a lot of games that are vastly more complete, yet I've sank more hours into Oort Online, faster than I've sank time into the last lot of Triple-A games I've bought. It's a pleasant looking game, it's got a fantastic community, it's got wealths of potential, and I'm genuinely excited to see where the game is this time next year.\n\nIf you're looking for Minecraft on Steam, this isn't it. Sure, it's a voxel-themed game, and you build, but outside of that it shares little with Minecraft. If you want a more detailed explaination of the differences between the games, you can click here.\n\nWhile Oort Online and Minecraft may be different, the one major similarity I've felt while playing is that sense of progress, exploration, and interest - all of which are headed by the excellent progress that Turbulenz are making.\n\nOverall, Oort Online is a fantastic foundation for what I'm sure will be a fantastic game.","November 16, 2014","true","89.7"," 12 of 19 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","12","19","0","0"

(It used to be Earlier Access, if you take my meaning.)

This game is clearly not a clone or a quick money grab like we have seen from so many other games. The dev team is putting some really love behind this game and it is utterly beautiful. I am pretty astonished at what they have done in this early Alpha I HIGHLY recommend anyone and everyone that is interested in the Voxel MMO genre that is starting to develop to throw their support behind this game.\n\nWhats the Good\n- Absolutely beautiful environments with amazing atmosphere. You really start to get immersed into the game because of the graphics and sound\n\n- Exploration, you can go anywhere and everywhere. The grappling hook adds a really fun angle to the game that lets you move quickly through the immense environment\n\n- The vision of the dev team is translated really well into the game. You can tell they love their work and this game\n\n- The mechanics are solid. Of course Minecraft laid the framework for Voxel games so at this early Alpha state most of the mechanics mimic any other voxel game\n\n- Its on steam, big plus!\n\nWhats the Bad\n- At first you are overwhelmed at the shear vastness of the environment. The world is immense and it can be a bit daunting at first\n\n- Lots of unclear block types. The world is alien so you have purple blocks, strange blocks with circles and others. You aren't sure as to what tool to use on what blocks. But it doesn't take much to harvest blocks so it isn't a big deal.\n\n- Performance is a bit slow and you can understand why. My newer gaming laptop handles it well but there are times that performance gets hit and being in early Alpha it is understandable.\n\n\nGetting the Game\nI really don't like pre-ordering games and I like getting into Alphas even less. Too many times the games don't live up to the hype or the game turns into garbage. Heck some devs just abandon the community for a year. I am a huge fan of MMOs, rogue-likes, and voxel based games. Oort has all of these elements and is doing them well in this early Alpha stage. If you want to support the growing voxel MMO genre I would recommend you get into the Alpha. Even if you don't play it that much supporting the dev team will help push this game and genre forward. We need to support developers like this that are making a great game not just another cheap money grab.\n\nIf you don't want to invest in the game yet (I understand I really do) then get the word out on social media to create some hype. The more people know about this game the better it will become.\n\n\n**Highly recommend and look forward to this game ruining my life when it gets released.

This game is just brilliant example of early access game where only 5% of advertised features are avaiable in the game. Devs shows that this is pre alpha. But... who is selling 100 MB pre alpha for 32 € for God sake?!\nOn the official videos devs are talking that features ARE in game and you ARE able to do something. Nope. You are not! Because 95% of features described as ready to use in the official videos are not implemented yet. In 3 months since release first official trailer to this day (moment of writing this) devs focused on graphical stuff rather than main content of the game. Nothing huge has been changed in 3 months. No great content. Nothing.\n\nIn the version based on release day you are able to place maybe 15 kind of blocks. There's no crafting, no mobs, no chests, no some kind of survival or tools to use. Oh, well, you have shovel and pickaxe, but you can't upgrade them or lose them by death. Every new player gets some blocks for building and that's all. Everything described on the official site will be... someday in future.\n\nOort Online devs received near 120 000$ in total funding progress to the day when I wrote this negative review. This is nice amount of money. In few monts they have made biome system and placing blocks system. That's all. Even 3rd person camera isn't done yet - you are huge brown or pink block :-)\n\nSo far, devs don't deserve 30+ € for this game. After 3 hours you will find everything avaiable in this version (25 november 2014), after 3 another hours you will be bored... That's all I can say.\n\nDevs. Show me the sense of building tower to the sky using 15 kinds of blocks and spending 30+€ on this game. Without saying "you are supporting our game and future updates". Show my why people should buy this game in this stage...\n","November 25, 2014","false","1.9"," 167 of 321 people (52%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","52","167","321","13","27"

I immediately started looking to see what the current price of PS4's was... to my surprise, I found out that the game was in pre-alpha on PC... now, I normally steer relatively clear of early access stuff (even those that I've backed on Kickstarter)... but something about the look, feel and potential of Boundless made me want to buy it.\n\nI'd played minecraft fairly extensively on and off for about 2 years, so I was expecting a game that at least met that calibre of enjoyment and content.  At first, I'll be honest, I was a little disappointed - maybe I was expecting the game to look like the demo video - but then I started getting lost in how visually brilliant it looks, even at this stage of development.  It's not minecraft... it may have gotten it's bare roots from minecraft, but Boundless has certainly evolved beyond that concept and started to carve a new path to become its own game, surrounded by its own lore and a very much involved community with which the developers interact constantly.\n\nI was suitably impressed as the depth of field and the level of detail and other such graphical and gameplay differences that set this upcoming title apart. Yes, it does currently lack content, but you need to remember, this is a pre-alpha title... which now has the backing of Sony to also become a PS4 title in 2016, so development has been ramped up if anything.\n\nIf you're looking for a title that is ready to play, won't crash, and has a whole bunch of great content, you should probably steer clear for a little while (but add it to your wish list for later!), however, if you like being involved in an active, friendly community of both gamers and developers, where your comments will be taken on-board, coupled with playing a sandbox game that is taking shape around you and each update is a discovery of new and interesting things, you may want to take a look and see what it's all about... I'm glad I took the plunge, as I can't wait to see what the next update brings!","November 7, 2015","true","140.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

The mining, building, surviving gameplay is really good for, well, anything. Put it into a nice looking world, and it will be as fun as before, in an other game. Now, Oort Online offers the same gameplay with some changes, and with advanced visuals. The block world is the same, but the shaders, the colors and the effects are totally different, makes the cubes pretty nice. In the current state, Oort Online has not much to offer but walking around, destroy some blocks and build something awful. BUT there are signs of what may come next! And those signs are not omens, but hopes for a fresh restart of an awesome gameplay, what is really much desired even by the Minecraft fans.","November 22, 2014","true","1.4"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

It combines building and lighting in a game unlike one I've seen before. Kind of like being your own architect. As it is now, it's fun to just build and create, but constant updates every week keep me on the edge of my seat to see what happens next.  It's nice to see players all over take part in constructing one area by just...well...doing whatever they want.

Although it pains me to do it I have to compare it to Minecraft in it's basic gameplay, that being voxal and building. However unlike Minecraft the look of the game is much what you would expect from a modern game. While that gives you a great explination of the basic resource gathering and construction mechanics it doesn't give you even a glimer into the way the game really works so I will try to.\n\nThe game is split into servers which are called 'Worlds' and each world is very unique in the way it looks and the types of resources you can find there in. While often players will have a 'Homeworld' to stay in to construct whatever massive building or impressive landscapes it is really intresting and one of the best single features of the games to explore the other worlds to find diffrent blocks for your buildings. However while wondering around a world of ice and snow and then a forest of sky touching trees is amazing in itself one of the best experiences is stumbling across other peoples constructions. I wondered around a world and found a stone bridge followed the bridge which was huge going from the top of a mountain held up by massive stone pillers coming out of a lake. At the end of the bridge I reach a massive days-to-build castle built in a cathedral style with massive glass windows and a huge hall lit with lanterns and a glass ceiling from which the sun streamed through at the right point of the day, the whole thing visable from miles around.\nIn one world you can find my Shinto Arch towering out of a watery world filled with lakes and mountains and at night the lanterns shimer, lighting it in the darkness.\nThat if only that makes Oort online not only beautiful for its stunning landscapes but for the buildings others build adding to the overal experience of the game and with the features being planned and readily worked on (Players are kept updates on the work being done which is great) makes Oort online a must buy game even in it's early state.\nIf you want to wait a bit longer for the game to have more of the freatures planned, add it to your wishlist but I would suggest buying the game right now and even if production stopped right now I would still get hours and hours of enjoyment out of the game easily.\n100/10.

While it will inevitably draw comparisons to Minecraft because of the blocky nature of the game, and definitely draws inpiration from it, it is by NO means a rip-off. The game is very far from finished currently, (pre-alpha) and is actually aiming to be more of a rpg, with features like classes, guilds, raids etc. planned, but not in the game yet. I have little to no faults with the game even in it's pre-alpha state, but there's just currently not much to do aside from building and exploring, so as of writing this it won't be for everyone, but just take a look at some screenshots or gameplay and you'll see why I've played 50 hours since its release on Steam a week ago. Everything said, the dev team for this game seems very meticulous and committed, as 3 very minor updates have dropped in the week I've had it, (small bugfixes and even a lighting update to make it look how they wanted,) so I'm hopeful this game will reach it's true potential!","November 19, 2014","true","53.2"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","9","15","0","0"

I know that it's not fair to call it a clone as this is pre-alpha and many of the features have yet to be implanted, but I had to say it anyway because at this stage of alpha, the game doesn't really offer much more than Minecraft does as a building and exploration game. It is confusing to jump into as a newbie and the interface is very confusing (text hard to read?), but the scenery and graphics are very charming and beautiful. It's a delight to wander around and explore (the grappling hook is an added bonus!)\n\nI can't wait to see where this game goes and am excited to see more of the RPG elements added.

Pennypacker","http://steamcommunity.com/id/trockeee/","42 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nFirstly understand that this game is currently in early access in other words the available game is currently incomplete. Also what's currently available is not necessarily a reflection what has been developed many features may be complete but have yet to be released. Currently you can only build using basic blocks craft a limited amount of items and server populations are quite low. However the game currently has over 10,000 supporters and  a developing team working around the clock. Before purchasing I recommend you visit their website.\n\nThis game has *BOUNDLESS* potential! Before making judgements purely based off the trailer and assuming it to be a clone of Minecraft check out their website: playboundless.com. The game has many features which have been previously seen in other great games however has it's own unique flavours. The developers of this game don't seem to be rushing to pump out a game for profit instead seem to be crafting a game for the players. For additional information check out their forums which can be found through their website!\n\nIf you're interested in my personal take of the game it feels like a combination of Minecraft, World of Warcraft, Diablo and EVE Online. For role players the game's lore does not seem to set in stone at the moment, however it does have general concepts, which is a unique opportunity to contribute to the lore of the game. It has a player driven economy, progressive game content, a guild system and PORTALS AND GRAPPLING HOOKS (that combination it self should buy you)!","November 9, 2015","true","4.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"Why?" you ask, well here is couple things I find worth it:\nThe developer team is working actively together with the community and they also are polite around the table(so everyone is treated equally not just the people with the fat wallets or the most fanatic supporters of the game, very example behavior and showing they care about the community)\nYou get to test and help work bugs out and make suggestions if you think the game needs something or there is something that could be improved on\nWhat comes to the game at its' current state, the experience is very smooth and stable for a pre-alpha release. As comes for features, there isn't yet much implemented besides most basics(movement, gathering, building, few tools, very basic combat) so in current state there isn't too much to do besides building, hunting couple different monsters and exploring the different planets.\n\nWhat is Boundless aiming to be when it's done? Boundless is aiming to be an open ended community run sandbox role-playing massively multiplayer game.\nWell that sounded awfully complex, how is Boundless going to achieve this? With very commited developer team that believes in their ability to make it a reality and the great input of the whole community around Boundless.\n\nSo if you see the same potential this game has that I and everyone else who's bought in on it, I recommend you to go for it, but if you'd like to do a little more research before jumping on the bandwagon you should look more information on their offical web site and forums at http://playboundless.com/.","November 6, 2015","true","112.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

For those of you not savvy of minecraft, that means before any real content was in the game. Just a massive procedurally generated world, and nobody really knew what to expect from it.

Each one looks distinctly different and im always intrigued to see what formations i might see over the next hill. Player population is sparse so it often times feel like i actually am an explorer, and the few player houses i find are the relics of a long lost age.

Develepors, if you are reading this, either the cost needs to be drastically reduced, or you need to stop focusing on tiny lil fix-ups like cloud shadows, and focus more on giving more meaning to the game. True, it looks beautiful, and you can build, but that's about it. There's no objective. There's no leveling. There's no models, no creatures, no upgrading, no survival... nothing but a world with really nice looking blocks. I know it's a really early stage in your game's development, but do NOT price the game at $35 as soon as it's on the shelves if there's nothing to do but place blocks and swing around. That's why you don't have more people playing this game: It's a game for rich people with nothing to do other than sit around and build things in games to feel good about themselves, to be blunt. How many commonplace people can afford a game like this, and how many of Them will be disappointed when they don't get their money's worth out of it? I'd say that at the very most, this game needs to be $15. I'm sorry, again, but this is utterly rediculous.\nP.S. If the servers are costing you so much, get rid of a few of them.

Since I had written this, the Boundless team has achieved NPCs, basic playermodels, better inventory setups, skins and models for weapons and tools, and more. My previous statement of them just making blocks prettier has been built on as well, making much better lighting, realistic environmental sounds, high quality textures, and different shaped blocks for more advanced building. Along with a slight growth of population, world amounts are apparently being toned down, and the focus is starting to shift more to the players than to the environment. I can see now that my $35 were, indeed, well spent, and I now encourage people to try and purchase this game. It is now successfully timeworthy, and has not even reached 1.0.

There's no models, no creatures, no upgrading, no survival... nothing but a world with really nice looking blocks. I know it's a really early stage in your game's development, but do NOT price the game at $35 as soon as it's on the shelves if there's nothing to do but place blocks and swing around. That's why you don't have more people playing this game: It's a game for rich people with nothing to do other than sit around and build things in games to feel good about themselves, to be blunt. How many commonplace people can afford a game like this, and how many of Them will be disappointed when they don't get their money's worth out of it? I'd say that at the very most, this game needs to be $15. I'm sorry, again, but this is utterly rediculous.\nP.S. If the servers are costing you so much, get rid of a few of them. It's not like there's ever gonna be any more than what, 15, 20 people playing at one time.\n\n*EDIT FOR 2015:\n\nIt's been over a year since I wrote this review, and only find it fair to look at the progress that the newly named Boundless has taken up, and give a new review. Since I had written this, the Boundless team has achieved NPCs, basic playermodels, better inventory setups, skins and models for weapons and tools, and more. My previous statement of them just making blocks prettier has been built on as well, making much better lighting, realistic environmental sounds, high quality textures, and different shaped blocks for more advanced building. Along with a slight growth of population, world amounts are apparently being toned down, and the focus is starting to shift more to the players than to the environment. I can see now that my $35 were, indeed, well spent, and I now encourage people to try and purchase this game. It is now successfully timeworthy, and has not even reached 1.0. Buy this game.","November 23, 2014","true","9.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","7"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Asvarduil/recommended/324510/","Asvarduil","Asvarduil","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Asvarduil/","46 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nOnce upon a time, the Na'vi evolved into giant teddy bears, equipped with advanced, but still naturalistic technology.  They opened gates to multiple worlds seeding an interstellar empire that, one day, ceased to be.  That was several hundred years ago.\n\nBoundless - formerly Oort Online - is a MMOBlock-Buildy game centered around the ability to find portals to various worlds.  It's pretty much MineCraft with the interdimensional portal mod, only more visually polished and custom-built to host as many people as possible.\n\nNow, elephant in the room: this game is Early Access, and is therefore incomplete.  I bought into it because I liked what I saw, and had read the reviews for both the good and the bad of what the game currently is.  I'm going to rate based on what's in what we've got.  When enough changes happen or the game goes 1.0, I plan to re-review the game\n\nWhat Works\nFirst, the game looks amazing.  Boundless really pushes what a block-buildy game can look like...the only runner up is the Free-to-Play game Trove in this department.\n\nAlso, some of the mechanics are pretty cool.  Early on you can easily craft a Hookshot or a Grappling Hook - as far as I can tell, there's nearly no difference between the two.  Some video game logic applies - apparently, Na'vi technology is so advanced sticks work as expandable rope - but it makes exploring worlds easy, as long as you don't grapple yourself to death, possibly losing lots of materials in the process.\n\nWhat Does Not Work\nFirst, the menu controls are generally awful.  Escape opens the general MMO menu involving changing settings, leaving the game, etc.  Tab opens the inventory and crafting menus.  As default controls, this is a truly awful setup, because it feels genrally bad to use.  My suggestion would be to take a page from MineCraft and unify the inventory and crafting interfaces under Escape, but add a button that allows you to access the MMO menu.\n\nSecond, the crafting system is remarkably shallow, with few things to actually create.  Now, as said before - this is an alpha game, barely out of being a prototype.  I'm aware of that.  However, to retain players, you need more stuff for us to build.  Some melee weapons would be a good start - Wooden and Stone swords are good ideas.  More uses of "Gleam", the primary mineral, would also be welcome - creating a portal in a secure room in my base is something I'd love to do, but other things like creating a crafting table that allows for more advanced crafting would help.\n\nI would go on, but I did say immediately that this is an in-development game.  I think the reason there are few people playing this, is simply because what we have, isn't fun or substantial enough.  Visual polish does not make a game great.  I've played two hours as of the writing of this...and a quick look at the Boundless Wiki shows me that I've experienced most of what's actually in this game, other than finding a portal.\n\nThe TL;DR\nAt the current price of $34.99, I cannot recommend this game.  I support supporting the developers, but the alpha game we have here is overpriced for what we're actually getting.\n\nThat being said, we do have a truly intriguing foundation here for a great game.  This game has soul - you can tell the developers put blood, sweat, and tears into what we do have.  I'm glad I backed it with my Steam purchase, and I look forward to what the developers do with this intriguing title.  However, if yoiu're a gamer who is expecting more of a game out of Early Access, wait for a while - I'd guess about a year.  Let them fully bake this.","November 26, 2015","false","2.3"," 18 of 36 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","18","36","0","3"

With all the stuff coming, and all the stuff in the works, I can't see why anyone would pass this up.)\n\nMy boyfriend and I bought this game two nights ago, and had a blast playing for the rest of both nights. A lot of people bring up Minecraft similarities, and while the building system is similar, there's more to it with this game for sure. Boyfriend and I played a lot of MC, and we already like this game more.\n\n+ The graphics are phenomenal. We really feel our buildings come to life in this game. The textures and shapes of the blocks, paired with the gorgeous atmosphere (sounds, lighting, sky, everything) really make everything pop.\n\n+ Right now, you start with a few different block types in your inventory. You can set it to infinite blocks, so you don't have to spend time gathering. However, I've found a new type of block through exploration, which was really nice.\n\n+ When I needed a break from building, grappling my way around the world was equally as fun. The landscapes are breathtaking, and it was also really fun searching for signs of life. It's so nice stumbling upon a cabin, or a room built into the side of a mountain, or a tower in a valley. Also, exploring other servers has been a blast, too. Some of the structures are mindblowing. :D\n\n+ Right now, all there is to do is build and explore, and I think it's worth the price as is. With all the stuff that's in the works, this game could be huge. I can't even say how excited we are. The team is also very interactive with the community, and patches come out oftem.\n\n+ The only one thing missing as the game is, is playing as a character. All players are orange blocks right now. You forget that pretty much instantly though, as soon as you start to build or explore.\n\n\nI really could go on and on, but this gets the major points across.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/LordDan/recommended/324510/","LordDan","Lord Dan™","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LordDan/","370 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nSUMMARY\n\nIn short. I feel the game would be better if it had a single-player mode, or at least LAN or self-hosting of around 16 players. The world looks griefed already on some servers and it lacks a lot of features. I tried to enjoy it, but just couldn't push myself past 30 minutes.\n\nPersonally would suggest waiting for more progress.\n\nCURRENT THOUGHTS (FULL)\n\nI'm not really sure why this game has so many positive reviews when there really isn't much to do at all.\n\nThus far, I've put very little time into the game, literally 30 minutes by the time of writing and I'm bored. Very bored. I've taken 30 minutes to walk around and see a massive bunch of monstrosities that people call "creations" including the typical Minecraft 1 block wide towers to floating platforms and ugly as hell zigzag leaf platforms/roads from one mountain to another. I do not see the point in beautiful graphics if the world looks griefed already.\n\nBuilding itself is, well, building. There is nothing revolutionary or new when it comes to building, other than a slope, but I don't much care for that. I can add that MC with a mod if I wanted slopes. The block types are also rather limited.\n\nThe features listed in the features list of the store page appear to currently be non-existent. Sure, the developer has stated below the feature list that "Many of these features are in development and not yet available in the Early Access version (pre-alpha). Follow updates on oortonline.com to see what's coming next and when." Whilst this may be acceptable to some, I feel it is not enough. The website itself reveals no information about what is, and isn't in the game thus far and also goes into details about features that appear to not be in-game (judging from the lack of imagery, or rather, the overuse of concept art instead of in-game media.) If the features are not yet in the game, list them as such.\n\nThe graphics of Oort are great, yes. Very nice, we have shaders for Bloom lighting and Depth of field. The water reflects water too. That's real nice and all, but Minecraft did just fine with 16 pixel textures. The graphics alone should not sell the game. I get the impression this game has focused soley on graphics to date and just put a couple of placeable blocks in for good measure. The game lacks a lot.\n\nThe multiple servers listed do not tell of how many players are currently in the world, however, every single server today was listed as "quiet". I've also never seen a single player in game thus far. Is this dead already? Or has everyone left due to boredom? If so, why so many positive reviews? WHERE ARE THE PEOPLE?! Oh also, some of the servers I tried to join were down.\n\nIn my humble opinion, these games are far more successful when they're single-player and allow for self-hosting at minimum. I am not convinced that Oort will go far, despite how promising it may look, if it focuses solely on MMO. In my experience, people who truely enjoy building, and are good at it, dislike servers populated with poor quality builds and leaf towers. These groups would rather self-host and build freely without the mess on their horizon.\n\nThis will be Oort Online in 6-months http://unixpapa.com/zigguide/spawn.png (but with shaders)\n\nWould personally suggest waiting for a couple months worth of progress.\n","January 18, 2015","false","0.4"," 18 of 38 people (47%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","47","18","38","5","8"

The game itself has big plans and their site is well made. They have released several games in the past and I honestly feel that Oort will be the better version of Minecraft your kids would love to play.\n\nI currently play this game wiht m y 6 year old regularly. Though I quickly get bored with little to do, he has a ball and enjoys building constantly and exploring with the grappling hook.\n\nIn a few months or maybe even a year when much of the game is fleshed out.. i see this game being something really good and having a strong following.\n\nAgain though as it stands there is no form of combat or anything to have combat with, if you dont have friends you might never see another person, and building is very limited.. but you can get creative.\n\nExploring is epic in this game.. digging straight down can be scary! ( sometimes i find a cavern... with rocks 100+ ft below, lol ) and building can be quite fun.\n\n\nThe only concern I have is having limited servers and everything being shared... its going to look like a ghetto very quick after official launch with thousands of ppl building mismatched towers with neon lights and giant holes in the earth...\n\n\nOh yes one last note.. if you run any given direction forever... you can literally fall off the map ... lol and then its all flat green grass.......... for infinity...

I have read some negative reviews comparing the game with minecraft, or saying there are only placeholders for player characters, that there is no crafting etc. So straight away we can say this is not complete, and is not being sold as complete. That is a very important point to remember before you buy. So I am going to review this, as in its current state, and how that measures up to expectations.\n\nI would recommend looking at all the videos, checking YouTube lets plays, and reading the developers site, and doing your research through the steam community. When you have done that, you will have a feel for how this game is at the moment, and what’s coming down the line. It will set your expectations, and if you decide then to jump in and join the community, you will almost certainly NOT be disappointed.\n\nSo with that in mind, I am about 5 hours in. I really like what the developer has done so far. The game engine is smooth, really nice to look at, and there is a lot to explore currently. There are lots of player creations you can find, mainly around the capital areas of each world. There are servers globally, East EU, West EU, the United States, and Australia. At the moment, the servers are very quiet, and that’s to be expected, as the player base grows.\n\nThere is a lot of work already done here, with the voxel engine, there is a basic blockset, and the minimap is now also in place. Crafting is unlocked, and is on the way. The worlds themselves seem very large, with a really nice day / night cycle, and amazing lighting effects. I have really enjoyed the few hours I have put in, and intend to put in a lot more. This game has huge potential, and as long as it continues to grow, it should be awesome.\n\nOne point is the comparison to minecraft. Sure there are similarities, but for one thing everyone exists in the same persistent universe. When the portal system is fully implemented, players will be able to "step" through to other worlds, and even create their own portals. Also the texture and lighting effects even at this early stage are much better than other voxel based games. the volumetric fog for example looks incredible. Its important to realise this is not minecraft, it is a crafting sandbox game, but there the similarity ends\n\nI am realy excited about this game, it has incredible potential, and already has a rapidly growing player base. I would definitely recommend checking it out, if Early access is your thing.\n\nI will update the review as the game progresses..\n\n\n\nOK Game has progressed --------  Or rather hasnt.\n\nI am changing my review, because this appears to be turning into another one of those games where the DEVS just do not follow through. I have waited and watched, and initially I was so excited for this game. Unfortunately, it appears there has been little movement on behalf of the devs, and nothing major added in the last months. We can only make so many excuses, like - they are working on tons of content. -  thats great, drop it in, let me play it, and Ill give it another big thumbs up. - until then I would have to advise caution on this title. - great idea, fantastic potential, but possibly slipping due to lack of developer interaction.","January 14, 2015","false","12.1"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","38","3","8","0","5"

If you like good looking blocky games with lots of potential then this is the game. Just watch the videos.\n\nI bought the $250 package in December 2014 through Oort Online (included 4 Steam keys at launch + 2 pre-release keys)  because this game looks so awesome, has tons of potential, and I had some extra money in my 2014 gaming budget. The four copies are for my wife, two daughters (9 and 11), and myself.\n\nLast week I shelled out another $70 for two Steam gifts for my 4 and 6 year old boys because my gaming budget was renewed after January 1, 2015 and the boys have been begging for Oort Online (OO) since I showed it to them.\n\nA bit about our voxel gaming history. I bought 4 Minecraft copies from Notch in the alpha. Then two more in beta. Since 2009-2010 timeframe we have hosted our own family Minecraft server on Linux for friends and family. Those 6 purchases have added up to over thousands of hours of family play time (all LAN play in same rooms). After 4+ years of Minecraft playing when I saw the OO in-game videos and feature list l bought into Oort Online. If Oort Online pans out then the investment will be very tiny for the return (thousands of hours, even more than Minecraft). If this game fails then my wife will not approve any more pre-release games.\n\nThe game promises:\n- LAN / private server options (we love options)\n- Native Linux server software\n- Multiple races with different attributes\n- Trading / economy\n- RPG aspects\n- Skilled developers (they claim) focused on engine and networking first\n- Grapple hook is the best sandbox addition EVER!\n- Motivates my kids to get their school work done so they can play more OO.\n- Variety (Randomness of worlds, wildlife, fauna, vegetation, etc)\n- Robust world generator\n- Portals!\n- Bouncy blocks!\n- Beacons\n- Much more...\n\nCurrent cons (as of Jan 22):\n- No re-mapping of keys. I'm left handed and can't play with WASD setup so I have to let my daughters play while I watch.\n- Lack of road map features.\n- Now that my boys are playing their Steam pre-release versions my daughters are now begging me to get them pre-release keys. The packages on Oort Online have X release keys with < X pre-release keys. That's not very family friendly when I simply wanted to support the devs with a big purchase but now my family can't enjoy pre-release together.\n\nI spend my time watching the boys running around the worlds, sliding, climbing, bouncing, and swinging around like an intoxicated Spider-Man. They really enjoy just moving around and checking stuff out now. We're all patiently awaiting more features to be added.","January 22, 2015","true","5.0"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","2","6","0","0"

People want to compare this to Minecraft, because they're both voxel games, like it's a bad thing. Minecraft is pretty much the "king" of it's genre, when you consider the replayability, the community, and how much money it's made over the years. If you consider that and compare Oort to it, then take in to consideration that Oort will have MMORPG elements to it, which in turn will only make the game bigger...

They have a crap ton of work ahead of them, and I can't wait for them to get it all done! They continue to add more and more beauty to this game, and I can't beleive how awesome it is. I was gonna wait for it to go on sale, but I caved in and spent $35 on it. Worth every penny. I recently died and lost all of my stuff, but I am already back and starting from scratch, cause I love this game (anyone who has rage quit before knows how much this really means).\n\nConsidering buying it?

Went into this game with such high expectations from the game but as you can tell from my hours played of the game I couldn't bear to crush my dreams. This game is either making a joke or needs some serious pacthes. First to take note of is that you can see from the varity of character types you spawn in the world and you see that your body is two cubes stacked with a brown shade. Second you just jump into an empty world which was meant for Online purposed only but all the servers seem to be empty go figure, I would even just be pleased with playing by myself but it looks like it is primarily focused on Online experience which seems to have failed. Third it is very costy but that was not gonna stop me from getting this game which I thought could be my next favourite game but boy was I wrong...it was all false advertsing.\n\nIf you are interested in this game please just consider what I said, and I can see how much effort the devs put into this game because the graphics are amazing but please game devs the players are more critical on gameplay than graphics.","June 6, 2015","false","0.7"," 4 of 11 people (36%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","36","4","11","0","1"

This is the least thoughtful, most boring insignifigant game I've ever had the displeasure of palying.

When I checked their website I saw why this game will never be any good. It's all about getting backers who want exclusive backer garbage, and I doubt its factoring in steam sales. So, yeah. It's gunna be trash and forever stalled. It will be eternally early access. As of right now the real things that got me to get it were that you could customize a character rpg like and be a part of a community. There is 2 servers near me and I've only seen one person online once, also, characters are just square blobs. I don't think crafting or leveling is even in the game yet, all you can do is build and swing around. I saw no npcs or anything like that. The randomly generatedness of it all too is pretty awful. You usually cant walk two squares without having to jump to progress, or you are always falling down a cliff till you die. Its just mountain after mountain. I'm sure theres more, Ive seen some flat areas... but they are appalling because of trees. If you want to see a tree youll probably have to dig it out of the ground... thats your random generating. Maybe in about 5 years, when people say enough with the early access and the game is forced to be released because it gets such negative reviews, it will be ok. Even the 155 dollar backer deal gets you a bunch of crap, not much different from the basic backer deal... this seems to be all they want. Like they will make more money with it as an early access with a bunch of buy this features and slowly drop one little update at a time.\n\nI could be wrong though... It may be great if they actually progress some of the core features they advertise like the character rpg system, the story, and crafting. So far, no update I've seen has even adressed any of these but there has been plenty of advertisements for their website which takes you right to there backer sales page.","December 10, 2014","false","5.0"," 9 of 30 people (30%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","30","9","30","0","0"

As I've said in my other reviews, I understand this is my issue and I'm guessing the majority of players do not need this aid.  Thus, I can say the game is very pretty and I'd bet it's a lot of fun...but I can't really play it yet.  Once they've granted me the ability to reverse my Y axis I will likely play the heck out of this game.
