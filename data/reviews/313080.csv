If you enjoyed games like Payday 2 or Monaco you’ll most likely enjoy this one, too, even if they are entirely different games. Still, this game can easily hold its own and has more than enough content for an Early Access version.\n\nThe comparison to aforementioned games isn’t a completely honest comparison because Payday 2 is a first-person shooter focused on a whole lot of shooting (if things go wrong, that is) and Monaco is really more about stealth than tactics. But The Masterplan masterfully combines several of the elements used in these games: first of all, you view the action from a top-down perspective and there are several ways to finish a mission; guns blazing, with careful planning or - if things go wrong - a combination of both. You will also holdup civilians and cops among other things related to heists.\n\nYou can walk freely to wherever you want, as long as it’s not towards a place that raises suspicion. You’ll control several goons, which can be controlled individually or as a group. It’s usually a good idea to just walk around and see where everything is located before taking any action. Once you have an idea of what to do you can strategically place your goons and let them do what they’re supposed to do.\nAs an example you could have a goon set up near the entrance of the place that holds people who are entering or about to leave hostage, one that holds the store manager hostage (which you can then control to open things, for example) and another one could knock the store manager out once he’s done with that (or before that, and have a goon open the door him-/herself). There are many ways to complete the heist, and there are many ways a heist can go wrong. The store manager could call the cops, which will then arrive shortly after, making it nearly impossible to get out without killing anyone. Do something suspicious on camera and again, the police will be alerted. Or civilians could see an unconscious or dead body and, yup, could call the cops.\nIt’s a game that requires a good bit of strategy but thankfully the developers have implemented a feature to slow down time for people that usually don’t play strategy games or have a difficult time improvising when things go wrong. It’s a feature that doesn’t use a time mechanic so you could play the entire heist in slow motion if you wanted to. It makes the game very accessible to all sorts of players.\nThe maps aren’t that big to begin with and that’s actually something that I liked. It’s hard to manage your characters when they’re miles apart from each other. Some of the maps of the later heist missions are just big enough for them to become cluttered. But I think there will actually be bigger maps in the final version. I just hope they don’t become too big.\nThere’s also a hideout map where you can eventually hire new goons and do some other stuff, and this is also where the game tells you about the game’s mechanics, besides the tutorial level (which basically explains the controls).\n\nThis Early Access version has 5 different heists, ranging from very simple to pretty difficult. There are a few features missing right now, like goons having specific skills, a connecting story and, obviously, more heist locations. The developers states that there is about 1,5-2 hours of gameplay in this version and I agree. But you could add an hour or even a few hours more if you want to play things in a different way. So far, this version is already extremely polished and it runs great without any problems. I also didn’t encounter any bugs so far, but maybe I’m just lucky. Who knows ?\n\nThe graphics are 2D and shown from a top-down perspective. The characters lack a bit of personality because of this but the graphics are just beautiful in general. It has a nice 70s look mixed with what looks like some sort of comic book effect(s). It’s absolutely gorgeous to look at, and it’s all made with higher resolutions in mind.\nThe soundtrack consists of some smooth songs that have a jazzy feel that reminded me of old school heist movies. And that sounds exactly what they’re aiming for. So they did an excellent job there. Same goes for the sound effects which have an authentic feeling to them.\n\nThe Masterplan is on its way to become one of my favorite indie games. There’s still some work to be done, and I’m not talking about fixes here, but more about adding (final) content. This current version is already very stable and very playable and if you enjoy strategy games or heist games then this is a game you just must own. You can clearly see this game was made with passion and that’s absolutely something that should be rewarded. And the best way to do this is to just buy the game.\n\n[Rating: 87/100]","September 15, 2014","true","3.9"," 98 of 106 people (92%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","92","98","106","3","1"

In The Masterplan you manage your crew (at the beginning you have two heisters but you can hire more as you progress) as they take on heists anywhere from a convenience store to a high end jewellery store to a drug lord's mansion. The Masterplan lets you choose your own playstyle and you can either go for the stealth approach (highly recommended) or you can go in guns blazing.\n\n+Awesome hand drawn graphics that really capture the game's 1970's feel\n+Really cool threatening/hostage system which allows you to control other characters by pointing a gun at them\n+You can enter slow-motion at any point in order to plan your next moves\n+Lots of objects in the levels can be interacted with, power can be cut off, CCTV can be disabled etc.\n+Currently quite a few different and diverse heist targets all of which can be replayed as many times as you want\n+Quite a few weapons to unlock as you progress through the game\n+Money you earn in missions can be spent on new heisters or weapons for your ammo which provides the player good motive to find all of the money in any given level\n+The heisters you can hire have different abilities, strengths and weapons depending on how much they cost\n+You're provided with hints/intel on your target location while the game loads which is very handy\n+Simple control scheme\n+Reasonably regular updates\n+The devs are active in the forums\n\n+/-Cleaner fees are extremely high, personally I don't mind this because I prefer playing stealth in this game and this just forces me to do that more\n\n-No options menu, that means no graphical options other than a fullscreen toggle, no way of changing controls and no way of changing the volume in-game apart from toggling it on or off completely\n-Pathfinding isn't great, your characters will always take the fastes route which often means they'll just stop at a locked door rather than go a different way which isn't locked\n-It has some issues with crashing, I experienced three crashes in the first twenty minutes\n-Unconcious enemies wake up annoyingly quickly, within about thirty seconds of being knocked out\n\nVerdict:\n7.5\n\nDespite a few issues this is a great tactical heist game with awesome hand drawn graphics, great gameplay and loads of potential going forward.\n\n***This review was written using a key provided by the Developer for review purposes***\n\nEl K.","April 13, 2015","true","7.1"," 116 of 135 people (86%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","86","116","135","4","4"

Nope. This game was removed from early acccess too soon. Review is for v1.2.2\n\nUnstable.\nCrashes too often (Seems to be a memory leak. Perfomance gets worse the longer you play), especialy on the later levels that take longer to complete. Can't complete my current mission (3rd to last) as the game will crash before the mission can be completed. By design, you can't save durring missions. I'm ok with the lack of saving, but having to rush to try and finish a level before the game will crash, is not ok.\n\nControls are bad.\nOpening/closing doors are a large source of frustration. Game uses swinging doors with physics. To open a door to a room, you have to walk in to the door and then in to the room to open the door all the way. Until the door swings out of your face, you can't see anything past the door.\nClosing a door when facing it is often a two step proccess. You click the door to close it, and it swings on to your goon. He then has to turn away and walk away from the door as it will push him in the back if he does't move quick enough or of another goon is too close and blocking his path. Once the goon has cleared the door jam, he can turn around to face the door to lock it. This process takes WAY TOO LONG to complete. Have fun doing this when you want to lock enemies in a room before they can rush the door, push it open and punch your goons silly.\nDue to the bad controls, you are required to use two or more goons to do what should be simple tasks for a single goon. One to close/lock the door, second or third to hold a gun on the enemy to delay them breaking control. Sure you can knock everyone out and drop them in the room you plan to lock them in. You end up having to do that anyway, but it feels forced as the other method is so bad.\n\nPathing can be bad. Tell a goon to backup to move a small distance away from an enemy or anything actualy. Instead of turning and moving to that spot, they will try to move far away (often in to another room) and then loop back to the spot you told them to move to. It then turns in to move, cancel order, move again.\n\nGeneral bad stuff you can find in this game.\nHire goons based on their stats, yet once you hire them you can not see those stats again.\n\nGoons can be killed by gunfire (including your own). OK that's fine. Goons can be killed by melee attacks. These are the same attacks that only temporarily knock out the enemies. Can't revive your goons durring missions, nor can you carry them back to the hideout to be revived. They can be killed from being punched with bare fists. Not OK.\n\nEnemies can have melee weapons (baton) yet will not drop them when knocked out or killed.  Late game you find 1 brass kncukle. Whoopty-doo.\n\nAchievement to hire enough goons to reach a team of 6. What's the point when you can only bring 4 on any mission. Outside of that achievement, there is zero reason to have more than 4 goons at a time.\n\nPro's.\nSound and Art are nice.\n\nEdit: Went to double check the version of the game v1.2.1 or v1.2.2 and now it crashes on launch. Avoid this game.","November 22, 2015","false","26.3"," 82 of 102 people (80%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","80","82","102","3","5"

I suppose that micro-managing a robbery/heist wouldn't sound too exciting, but the very first time you walk out with that cash in hand (and no cops giving you a hard time), it gets you hooked.\n\nThere are many different ways to complete each heist, but eventually it all boils down to busting through the front door with SMG's, Shotguns, and Rifles, and mowing down everyone, greatly hoping that you make it out with at least half the loot. OR, you could go the stealthy methodical route with silenced pistols and tranquilizer guns, taking down cameras and stuffing people into rooms. Each heist has their own way of making you think, with their own way of rewarding you by doing things by the book. Some heists you absolutely have to go in armed to the teeth, and some will brutally punish you for not sneaking your way in.\n\nThe Soundtrack is simple and somewhat dynamic, but still does its job good. Makes the setting feel like a real 70's action flick. Sadly, neither Austin Powers nor Foxxy Cleopatra make a cameo in-game.\n\n5/5 Stars\n11/10 Would heist a kiosk again\n$50 out of $100,000 loot taken, with a 75% evidence cleaning fee.","June 6, 2015","true","21.2"," 80 of 105 people (76%) found this review helpful 101 people found this review funny","76","80","105","101","0"

The threat of violence always trumps violence, and stealth is to be preferred, if not always feasible. You control the crowds as well as you can, and if things go ♥♥♥♥-up, it turns into a smash-and-grab, trying to get out before the cops arrive and you end up in a firefight, which will at best be expensive (you're responsible for paying for "cleanup") and at worst devastating, with a party member dying.

You.will.not.regret.it.\n\nWhen I played "The Masterplan" for the first time, it blew me away to what extent it was uncomparable to anything else I've experienced before. At first glance you might be intrigued to draw a reference to Hotline Miami and honestly, this is the best thing that could happen to this game. While it presents itself in a familiar, established style, the game-mechanics itself are so one-of-kind, that it just draws you into this form of - I call it - "new" nostalgia, being reminded in a pleasant way of various, well-recieved games, such as Payday 1+2, Doorbreakers with its similiar top-down view and pace, Monaco with its different classes but by far not as arcadish and thought-out and finally a stylish, fitting gore which is reminiscent of the gruesomeness from the legendary Hotline Miami (of course by far not the same amount). And then again, it's a game of its own, which utilizes these known gameplay-mechanics in a different manner.\n\nFor me personally, the cherry on the cake, is the amount of choice it provides you with. You will always find yourself polishing your approach to a mission which fits your preference the best and honestly, if this game pulls off to show this many alternatives to finish a level on the small maps included in the Early Access, I can only imagine how far this will reach out when the game hits release.\n\nSure, there isn't very much to do at the moment but to replay the same levels and I'd understand, if you want to wait for more updates before your purchase.\nPersonally though, the developer had it easy to convince me.

Another main one is the controls, it is not to difficult to get used to, but the choice from blasting a hostage away or selecting him is just either Rmouse or Lmouse(so you'll accidently blow away civis like 70% of the time) even if you do press c and save his life by canceling command,the whole place will be alerted by your shots. Other then those two main problems, it's pretty flawless  (the AI path finding needs  little work but it could be a lot worse). So, unless you have a ♥♥♥♥ load of patience, no anger issues, and love this genre, I can not recommend this game AT IT'S CURRENT STATE. I know later updates will fix these problems and add so much more to this so far pretty fun game :)\n\nEdit: The new updates state the crashes have been fixed(which in my case is true) so now there is no reason to not get this game, also I have goten used to the controls and no civs have been accidently blasted away for a while now :D\nEdit 2: Never mind I just had another crash :(, whatever just buy the game on sale, it is really cool. It is one of those type of games I have been waiting a long time to be developt.\nEdit 3: Wow the game has changed a lot since the review, I now see absolutly no problems with this game now, there in no reason not to buy it if you like the genre :D","October 23, 2014","true","16.4"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","13","15","0","0"

This is not a matter of skill but abysmal pathfinding (e.g. on some maps, the first time you click will send characters walking all over the map instead of going through an open door) and animation (when you order a goon to lock a door there is a 70% chance that he'll get stuck in a loop, shuffling trying to get close enough to the door)\n\n2) game mechanics are odd, and terribly explained - e.g. the tutorial teaches the player that you can hold people at gunpoint to control them, but fails to mention that this only works in the tutorial (after that, it takes at least TWO guns to control people; keep in mind that you only get a single gun at the start until you grind enough cash to buy more). Have fun figuring that out.\n\n3) game is unstable - in my experience, there is a 50% chance the game will crash when you finish a mission\n\nEdit to add: And now the game crashes every time I try to launch it.

I've currently played 15 out of 20 maps.\n\nThe good:\n- Good game mechanics. Hold up hostages, disabling camera feeds, line of sight, fog of war.\n- Nice graphics that combined with the music, suits the game very well.\n- Nice map design that combined with the game mechanics offers different approaches to reach your goals.\n- A lot of potential if the developers decides to improve the game or make a sequel.\n\nThe bad:\n- The UI is lacking. Too easy to make mistakes\n- The AI is lacking. The NPC are too naive\n- The game is too easy.\n\nThe ugly:\n- Others have experienced game crashes and I've sadly exprienced that a couple of times myself.\n- Some NPC are too (and unrealistically) trigger happy. The police chief at the impound started shooting my goons that had stood idle beside the van during the whole mission. He never saw the one goon that had been active and who also was the guy that "unlocked" the chief (I hid behind the door when I unlocked the southern door). I just ran outside and started shooting like a maniac. So that was police brutality at it's worst.\n\n\nAs I said, this is a good game that could have been great. Even if the game mechanics is good, the game itself is just too easy. When you've gotten the basic and you have hired 1-2 more goons, found a guards uniform, you will, with a little patient, most likely run through most of the missions without much drama and no collateral damage. Basically, you send the guy in dress as a guard, and he will get you all the keys and cut of the camera feed without any problems. And then it is pretty much straight forward for the rest of your goons. You find yourself a room where you can lock off all exits (and make sure that it doesn't have a phone inside). And then you just "invite" one after another of the guards/civilians to that room.\n\nMuch of the problems is that the NPC, especially the guards, are too naive. Other problems is that the guards don't try to fix the missing camera feeds.\n\nSo what I would have liked to see regarding this is:\n\n- Guards try to fix the camera feeds. And if they cannot fix it, they become a lot more alert.\n\n- The guards communicate with each other for instance, via wire less (walkie talkie). So if the see something suspicious like a broken window, the call over other guards and they conduct a search. Also, they have com-checks now and again. So if you have lock guard A inside a room and guard B calls out for guard A and does not get an answerer, he will conduct a search.\n- More random behavior from NPC. For instance a guard get bored standing/patrolling, so I go to chat with colleague or goes to the kitchen to make a snack or go out for a smoke.\n- Different skill level on the guards. You can have one slacker who don't care if he saw something suspicious, others are extremely professional. And maybe having somebody that is completely paranoid.\n- random behavior when you hold up an NPC. For instance that some NPC can panic and try to run off.\n\n\nThis is not part of the review, but more on how I would have liked to the game to be.\n\nI would have liked to see a more complex campaign where the police will investigate your heist. Basically, your goons can leave evidence during a heist which may increase the chances for the police to find you. For instance if you get caught on the camera, if you don't get the tape containing that recording, the police will know how your goon look like. NPC can become witnesses if they see your face. You can leave fingerprints at crime scene. So to counter this, you can wear masks and gloves. But using this when you are only gathering intel, it will increase the rate of suspicion by the NCP's. Also, there should be a notoritey level, so the more aggressive you are, the more public wants your arrest, and hence, more resources will be put into trying to solve who is behind these heites.\n\nAlso it would have been fun if the game focused more on gathering intel before a heist. For instance you must have contacts to get the blueprint of buildings. Without these blueprint, the layout will be covered in the fog of war. Also you should be able to buy more intel, for instance how many guards there is at duty, how professional they and so on.\n\nAnd of course, it would have been cool having some RPG elements on your crew, learning skill and so on.\n\nAnd if all the above was include, it would the be put together with a sandbox career mode were you can include fan made maps to, and the "plot" is just to "earn" as much as you can until you either get caught or until you decide to retire. A little bit like Pirates. And this would also require a time-line where new technology becomes available both for you and the police (DNA for instance).\n\nAnd if you get caught, it would have been cool with a some prison break maps so you can arrange an earlier release. And if you don't decide to escape, you also can continue your career after you've served your time, if your health allows it.\n\nAnd what to do with the loot? Well, buy a lot of cool stuff, a mansion, a yacht and so on.\n\nMultiplayer would also be pretty awesome.","June 15, 2015","true","13.4"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","0"

You can pull of these heists in various ways such as walking in the front door and pulling your gun out and murder everyone inside, of course anyone who sees you doing this will imediately call the cops and you will have 30 seconds to get the hell out. Or you could walk inside, wait for the owner to go someone secluded, follow them, take them hostage and then get your friend to beat the hell out of them and then continue with only the customers to worry about. But of course some are much more difficult as guard will be involved.\n\n-Gameplay-\nYou control various men (in the future you will be able to hire your own men and such but for now you are given 'goons' on different heists) using your mouse and you tell them what to do and they do it. If you pull out a gun and aim at someone then they will freeze meaning they won't move and now you can control them but if you lose LOS a meter that slowly drains will drain much faster and when it runs out they will make a run for it or if they have a weapon attack you. There are various keys that open different doors and security guards that will watch cameras for illegal activity.\n\n-Conclusion-\n\nThis is a very well made game even for Early Access, I have high hopes for this game and definately reccommend picking it up now even though there are only 4 heists because they are highly replayable as you can approach in loads of ways and possibly improve on your last run. There are of course quite a few bugs and issues such as if the game lags it causes the characters to fly across the screen which is hilarious until it screwes you over, also something I 'hate' at the moment is if 'you' call the cops from a phone even if you haven't even entered the building yet when the cops turn up they will kill you on sight. I learned this because I wanted to see how they responded to calls incase it went south but the cops wanted to shoot first and ask questions later.\n\nFor now I give it an 8/10 for being fun, unique and amazing even if it is a tad buggy at times. Hopefully there will be some sort of MP as that would be incredible for this type of game.\n\nYouTube Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1wKPUh2RrI","September 16, 2014","true","4.8"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","12","14","0","0"

Also, the game seemed to black-screen when Tabbing out in full-screen.\nTechnical Issues - Frame Rate Drops\nThe frame rate tanks in areas some times and other times, the same place, same condition, it's fine.\nTechnical Issues - No Settings Menu\nThe lack of a volume slider or graphical setting menu was frustrating, the only options available are 'Music On/Off' and 'Toggle Fullscreen'.\nTechnical Issues - Fails To Remember Settings Selected\nEach launch you are greeted with blasting music even if previously you have selected to have it turned off.\nTechnical Issues - Fails To Issue Achievements\nMultiple achievements were failed to be issued upon completion of asked events. mainly the 'Complete _ Branch' achievements.\nGameplay - 'Loud' Combat Is Clunky\nThere are some problems with loud combat, say if a enemy walks around a corner and re-appears, your character will not continue shooting and your characters will constantly shoot each other if they are too close, rather than moving to the side. Also if a enemy is too close, you will not intimidate or hit them.\nGameplay - 'Stealth' Combat Is Un-Realistic\nNon-Suppressed weapons have a VERY VERY small alert range, You can Shoot a rifle at someone and hit from just outside their cone of vision, and they will not care.\nGameplay - Inventory Management Is Frustrating\nHaving To Drop everything between two objects to get it to a specific equip hot key got old fast.\n\nThe Good\nGameplay - Good Level Design\nThe level layouts are different enough that they are not repetitive but not too complex that you do not know where to go.\nGameplay - Variety In Content\nThe hiests are different so you do not feel like you are robbing the same store over and over.\nGameplay - Replay Ability\nYou can repeat each level to either try and get more loot, try not to kill anyone, etc.\nGameplay - Difficulty\nThe game was difficult enough so that you couldn't do a grand bank heist in two minutes, but not so hard that it takes an hour to rob a small shop.\n\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, I believe it's a great little game to kill some time, it reminds me of 'Payday 2' but in 2D, I had a lot of fun playing it.\n\nWorth The Price?\nI Got the game for ~£4.00 and for that price it is well worth it, but for the ~£14.99 asking price on steam, No, this is not a £15 to me.","September 29, 2015","true","14.9"," 17 of 24 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","17","24","0","0"

The graphics are very pleasant to the eye, and at the same time clear enough for all gameplay purposes. Levels are well-made, although I'd welcome a bit more guidance of e.g. the recommended number of goons (in arcade, for example, you can't - at least I couldn't - carry all the money out with only 2 goons) and/or equipment such as bombs or the safe cracker thingy.\n\nActual gameplay is an addictive mix of calm planning, mixed with constant adjustments to the ever-changing chaos that is your heist. Several mechanics are fresh and make a lot of sense, such as the threat system. The UI feels a bit unforgiving to a novice: I shot a person a few times by accident, but judging by watching more experienced people play, I think that'll resolve itself in time.\n\nI can't yet comment on the length or the ultimate challenge level of the campaign, but so far levels have been increasing in challenge constantly, which bodes well. Each mission so far have take only a decently short amount of time (15 minutes?), and require a few tries to succeed well. I'll most definitely be waiting to see the rest of the campaign, the rumored modding tools, and new developments by the team.","June 4, 2015","true","4.0"," 13 of 17 people (76%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","76","13","17","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MartyrA2J/recommended/313080/","MartyrA2J","MartyrA2J","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MartyrA2J/","557 products in account","I had the pleasure of playing The Masterplan back in October 2014, during its Early Access phase. When I played the game then, The Masterplan was essentially a single player version of Payday. You had a crew and committed several heists. Every part of the plan was left up to you, planning, execution, and escape. There are new features in the game, the ability to hire goons,  buy weapons, and equipment, Including a new items that lead to other heists or weapon orders.\n\nAs of June 2015, The Masterplan has left Early Access and the game is now complete. I am happy to say the game is fantastic and fun. Everything here still works rather well as it did in Early Access, combat, sneaking, and general law breaking. In case your not familiar with The Masterplan, you control a team of criminals from a top down view. The best example is something like Door Kickers or a more far more tactical Hotline Miami. If things get a little hectic you can use a slow-mo button to issue commands and order your goons to perform tasks ranging from, shooting, taking hostages, or safe cracking.\n\nNow while I covered most of how I felt about the game in my Preview(http://youtu.be/vefzlx_MtR8). I feel It's important to note how awesome the over all tone of the game is and how well it all works. While the graphics are simple they really do a good job of conveying the grit and crime of The Masterplan, almost in noir style. The music and sound effects are great and fit in perfectly as well.\n\nFor the purposes of this particular article, I wanted to cover the new things I enjoy and the things I wish worked a little differently. There is a story now intricately woven throughout the levels, little snippets of paper building the mystery of whats going on. There are cut scenes telling the tale of how your character broke bad during the Nixon administration. All of these add a little flavor and life to the game.\n\nThe hideout has seen a bit of updating as well. You now have the ability to hire goons and purchase weapons, as long as you have the right contact for the weapon. These can be acquired throughout the levels and add an extra objective aside from getting cash. This is all fine and works well but can lead the game to feel a bit grindey in the beginning as you have to repeat missions to earn enough cash. In later parts of the game this isn't a big deal. For the most part the hideout stayed the same, I would've liked to see a bit more added to it. Perhaps some sort of secret or way to expand upon it and make it the seat of your criminal empire. It just ends up being a stash place for your left over equipment/weapons and the place you go in between missions. Not a major complaint just my own personal wish.\n\nThere are several new missions and places to rob. Including new levels to finish out the story/campaign. All of these are crafted well and requires your keen focus as your order your team of goons. In general the gameplay felt smoother in controlling characters and maneuvering them, as opposed to the EA version of the game where it was a bit more difficult. Such things as being able to pass through your own men made things much easier. With that said there are still some things that are hard to control. Doors in particular are a nightmare and being such a vital element to the games strategy, I thought this would've been corrected a bit more.\n\nThings such as goon skills and multiplayer have fallen to wayside or replaced with simpler mechanics. I feel that The Masterplan will benefit from simplifying and focusing on the single player experience. While goon skills would've been nice, that is something that perhaps can be added later. In the final version of the game the focus on singleplayer can be seen and the game is very enjoyable.\nSo if you haven't checked out The Masterplan yet and you're looking for a heist style game that is solely based off your skill. You definitely want to check out this title.","October 18, 2014","true","4.6"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","11","14","0","0"

This game does not worth $15, period.)\n\nTL;DR: The Masterplan got a solid design that badly executed due to a poorly designed control and sloppy bug checking. Personally, I see about $15 worth of game here max. If the developers took the time to fix a bug and added a few function, maybe $20. The following is a more detailed explanation of what "The Masterplan" did poorly.\n\n1. Grouping function: In a lot of sense, The Masterplan kind of plays like a RTS game. You got a bird's-eye view of the map where you control a group of units to take on another group of units. However, a fundamental feature in most RTS that is absent in "The Masterplan" is the grouping function which allows the users to easily switch control between units. Without it, you'd have to click and drag all the time on the map and hope that you get just the right goons that you wanna move and not a unit more. Which doesn't work too well in small spaces.\n\n2. pick/Drop body key: I'm scratching my heads as to why the developers didn't though of this one considered that is pretty much what I do half the time, carry my captives to a secure room and locking them inside, a dedicated pick-up and drop-off for body would make the gameplay a lot smoother.\n\n3.Bugs. This one is probably one of the major reason why I think this game doesn't hold more than $15 worth of value. Since start of the game, I've had 4+ crashes, the few is okay, sort of in the middle of the game crashes, only once was when the heist gets good so didn't bother me too much. But the last two times the game crashed at startup, and manual hash check doesn't solve the issue. Had I not found a solution on the forum, my review will consist of a big fat "NO". But it was a solution by the community so the developers didn't earn any points there. In this day and age there's just no excuse to leave a fatal bug like that in the game.","February 27","false","22.4"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","11","15","0","1"

The Masterplan is a game I really truly wanted to love. But… I just can’t… First off the game feels too half-baked for a game supposedly out of early access. Examples, why are there two lockpicks you can find on one level but no more anywhere else? Why can I not view my goons stats after I hire them? Why can't I buy a bigger car? Why after the final score is the only way of exiting back to the normal game to quit to the main menu? It in turn doesn’t save the game from that score so you can technically never fully finish the game. You will still get achieves for it however. And why oh why does the game crash so much? 30 out of my 50 hours spent on this game have been afk for the last 3 nights trying to get the, “It’s my dayjob” achievement seeing how it’s the last one I need to get only to find in the morning that the game had crashed when it didn’t even have to do anything other than just sit there. Finally, I am running windows 8.1 and have a GeForce GTX 750 Ti 2gb version and yet in full screen mode I only get 30 fps where in Battlefield 4 I get 80 fps that can drop to 40 when intense events are happening. That should not be the case at all for a top down game with such basic graphics.\n\nThe good.\nThis game did provide me with some 20 hours of entertainment and I ended up beating the whole game. In this time there were some pretty fun moments. For example, when I used explosives to blitzkrieg the bank and later perfected my technique to blitzkrieg the casino. It is also pretty satisfying to go through all the work to clear a level and make off with the loot walking through the stealthy (or loud) chaos you’re leaving behind. Some other fun moments consisted of, holding up around 15 guards with 2 goons while my other 2 rounded up everyone else on the level, having a level without cops or cleaner costs where I basically stormed in with Uzis and murdered everyone, making off with the 4mil from the final score. Despite not being able to keep it was still fun. These are some examples of the good times you can have while playing this game.\n\nPros and Cons\n\nPros:\nFun top down gameplay.\nAbility to hire and make a full sized crew.\nSatisfaction of perfecting a plan all the way through (as long as it doesn’t crash!)\nThe ability to carry out a plan in such different ways really makes you wonder how you can approach each level.\nPretty original idea.\n\nCons:\nFrequent crashes.\nLow fps regardless of good graphics card.\nHalf-baked unfinished features. (example lockpicks)\nLoud not a very practical option as you can lose up to 96% of your payout from cleaner costs alone.\nCan’t view goon stats after hiring!\nThe game will never technically acknowledge you completed the final score outside of an achievement, but everything else for that score resets.\n\nTL:DR/Summary\nAll in all this game is pretty fun at first providing a new and original idea. However, this game was yanked out of early access way to soon with too many unfinished features, and crashes to make it worth its $20 price tag.\n\nRecommended?\nNo\n","January 8","false","51.0"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","11","15","0","1"

You play as Joey Green. You are gunned down by corrupt police and left for dead. One thing however, you survived. You are in prison and have to escape. This level serves as the game’s tutorial. After this you meet up with your brother Gregory and start going on various heist missions.\n\nGraphics\n\nThe graphics/visuals are done in a very interesting style. The game plays from a top-down perspective and the early 70’s vibe comes through in the game’s art.\n\nAudio\n\nThe music sets the tone for the game. A very funky vibe scores the game as you go on your heist missions. Other sound effects include your standard gun fire, and punch sound effects.\n\nGameplay\n\nThe game shines in the gameplay department. You control Joey and his brother Gregory. You can move both at a time but will often need to control each of them separately to fully complete your missions. An early mission has you holding up a kiosk. You’ll need to keep the owner of the kiosk at bay by pointing a gun at him while you control your other character to empty the register. Sometimes you’ll need to knock a character out to obtain a key to get into the back room of a business. When holding up a character you can also control them and force them to open doors for you or complete other tasks.\n\nDuring your missions you will find flyers that will unlock other heists throughout the city. New weapons can also be added to your catalog by finding flyers for them as well. You have a hideout where you can buy weapons or hire additional goons. These goons will help you on your heists, but for a price. Each goon has a set of attributes. The better the attributes the more expensive they will be to hire. Some goons even bring their own weapons along. The weapon catalog allows you to order the guns you’ve found flyers for in other missions.\n\nThe game can get challenging, especially when having to control multiple characters during a heist. If you should fail a heist you have the option to retry it. Some heists can also be done again once you’ve completed them.\n\nOverall\n\nOverall The Masterplan is a very fun game. It can become fairly challenging at times but the option to retry a heist is great. The controls take a little time to learn when you are dealing with using multiple characters at the same time. You’ll learn the controls fairly quickly though. This game is highly recommended.","June 6, 2015","true","3.1"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

My detailed post about this issue on the game discussion page has been unanswered for a month now despite the devs checking on the board regulary. The developers seem to cherry-pick which posts they answer. They only pick posts, where they can copy-paste the same steps (run-parameter settings that lower the games graphic quality to the absolute minimum. which i obviously had tried already).

The map/level design is the sort of addition that some may overlook as a basic visual style, but it really helps bring together some of the strategy needed to successfully complete a level without your fellow gang members dying.  The lighting is also a huge highlight of The Masterplan. As your characters creep around corners, you will see shadows of upcoming textures begin to reveal themselves. It helps round out a very solid environmental design.\n\nDuring your heists, you will find weapon fliers hidden throughout the building that you must pick up and bring back to your hideout in order to unlock the weapon for purchase. This makes sense, but it would be nice to purchase some of the weapons a bit earlier, such as the silenced pistol, which is incredibly useful and would have been great to have access to from the beginning of the game. Then again, using a weapon can lead to less money as you are charged a “cleanup” fee at the end of each mission that is based on how many people you killed, with one kill cutting your overall pay in half.\n\nWhen it comes to the members of your gang, permanent death is a thing to look out for. You can replace your goons by hiring more using the money you have acquired. The criminals you can hire will come with different weapons and varying statistics and specialties.\nWith the huge selection of locations available, it is hard to find yourself tiring of robbing each and every location you come across. The levels become infinitely more entertaining when you figure out the perfect plan that sees you getting past every guard and squeezing out every dollar possible.\n\nThe Masterplan’s in-heist gameplay is, without a doubt, the most frustrating part of the entire experience. While looking over the map and devising a plan is fun, it is tough to set that plan up perfectly due to the confounding controls. The controls are based all around the right and left mouse click, with the left selecting your goon and the right controlling pretty much everything else. At first, you catch yourself constantly trying to move with the left click. You can open up each character’s inventory by clicking on said character with the right click, which is also how you pick up items. Because of this, you will run into multiple situations that bring about a host of frustration as you struggle to tell your character you want to pick up the money in front of you as opposed to just opening up their inventory. Another incredibly frustrating aspect is when you are expected to perform a hold up on your enemy. In a perfect world, this would have you throwing your gun up at an enemy and them following your commands. But in The Masterplan, you must keep your visual cone on the enemy or they will go crazy and call the cops. Doing so is much harder than it sounds, as you will find yourself needing to order enemies around to unlock doors they have the key to. Once you order them to unlock the door, they tend to move outside of your visual cone. Establishing constant sight on them feels next to impossible, as you must hold down right mouse button on your character to rotate where you aim. Being unable to use the right mouse button can lead to frustration, which can ultimately lead to your entire plan falling apart.\n\nTHE GOOD\n- Welcoming art style\n- Lots of locations to rob, including a bank and arcade\n- Decent amount of goons up for hire\n\nTHE BAD\n- Frustrating inventory design\n- Would be nice to unlock certain weapons earlier\n- Clumsy controls","March 30","true","5.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","4","5","2","0"

So the solution is creating alternative Windows user with latin letters or renaming current one (solution here: http://answers.microsoft.com/ru-ru/windows/forum/windows_7-performance/%D0%BA%D0%B0%D0%BA/0ed802de-d597-44c6-8dcf-d6002ffce86d).\n\nDevelopers are aware of the problem but can't do anything.\n\nThe game is really good. I passed 3 same levels while had no autosave and it was fun every run. Now that I have my progress saved it's even more fun. The only problem is that unexpected crashes here and there.

I tried to look into the options menu to see if there was any settings I could try chaning to fix this issue. Turns out there isn't an options menu, you can toggle fullscreen on and off, you can toggle music on and off, and you can see what the controls are, you can't even rebind the controls if you don't like the defaults. You can't change the resolution or anything that is expected of a modern day PC videogame. These issues and lack of features became very distracting and rendered the game unejoyable.

(Unrelated Note: Removing the Crash Dumper folder in the game's files delays these Crashes, but they still can happen at any possible time.)\n\nThe other issue being that there is no save feature. Sure, it autosaves, but without a manual save option, you can't save on important setups and maps just for safety from these annoying crashes.\n\nAll in all, this game still has bugs and issues, and it was sent out of Early Access a bit too Early.\n\nI recommend this, but I also recommend caution, and not playing it for a extensively long time, or else you'll be in tears.\n\n8.8/10\nWould Crash on (Spoilers?)

Overall I definitely enjoyed it; pretty much played it nonstop since I bought it.\n\nThere were a few minor things that I did not like though. One, it crashed quite often and when I was on the very last level on the very last part, it crashed, so I had to redo the whole entire level. Another thing, is the weapons pretty much suck overall. The only weapon I really used was the shotgun. Dont invest too must into weapons, rather invest into better goons. Finally, friendly fire is on and is not optionable, so whenever you got to stick people up or whatever, make sure you place your men strategically using the space bar. By strategically placing them in a room you make sure to avoid friendly fire if shooting must take place. This is definitely more of a stealth game than a shooting game. I, for one, avoided shooting at all cost because it is VERY expensive in the end.\n\nThis is a fun game with minor problems. It is a bit of a puzzle and stealth game so it is fun and relaxing yet edge-of-your-seat fun.

Not even slightly in a vague sense, never compare that awesome game with this thing. The multiple people are too hard to coordinate, the constant right-clicking and dragging gets confusing to deal with beyond 3 people. You will forget about characters on larger maps, like the warehouse. There is no game play, just managing what is happening. Management with no action is not something I like in a game. It will be interesting for about 20 minutes before the grind starts to set in, and maybe an hour before you realize your just doing the same thing over and over too slowly to be rewarding. The crashing is going to happen eventually, alleviated some by disabling the Steam overlay, but will still happen. If you get this game, I recommend getting an opinion within the refund window, so you have the best chances of getting your money back if you don't like it.","December 26, 2015","false","3.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

There are also a number of pathfinding issues that can prevent your crew members from finding their way to what you clicked on, especially if they are crowded in a tight space.\n\nTechnical issues aside, the game is great. The slow-mo mechanic prevents controlling your crew members individually from feeling tedious. Instead, it feels more like a puzzle game similar to the old game Commandos.

The gameplay is more of a puzzle/planning game with some very minor tactical elements. If you are looking for depth of action, look elsewhere.\n\nThe downsides are really all in the mechanics though, a lot of the games difficulty comes from unresponsive controls and the clunky interface that doesn't do what you want it to do "in the moment", leaving you frustrated when one of your goons runs off and trys to circle around the building when what you wanted him to run over and do was directly in front of him but some stray box told him to go the long way.\n\nAlso of interest is the metagame style used here where you evolve your crew and its tools between missions (or by going back and redoing missions to perfect them) which should in theory make every play through unique. Unfortunately there's not alot of depth to this either and the customization ends up coming down to generic thugs with random names and sometimes just redoing missions over again to get the money you need to finance a tool you need for the next mission.\n\nThere's a lot to like in this clever little strategy/puzzle game, but it's also pretty unpolished and it's not terribly long. Unfortunately it also started to glitch and hiccup. During the pause screen (which is like a bullet time where you set up a series of moves) the game would often hiccup (pause within a pause) and not actually accept your input commands. And since its not actually stopping the action you get to watch in slow motion as your goons don't obey your detailed commands. (And than trying to reclick on the person you need when there's 5 of them overlapping to redo a command sequence that was multistepped is an excercise in frustration)...\n\nI wish I could write a glowing review for this game, the core elements are there it's just not quite perfected and it's probably never going to be.\n\nIn the end I would still recomend the game but only on two conditions:\n1. you can tolerate some frustration in your puzzle interfaces\n2. get it on sale, I don't regret spending $5 on it, but I'd be pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off if I'd spent $20\n\nI'd kill for a less buggy version of the game or a "pause while planning" that isn't in glitchy slow motion, that would have been worth $20 instead of $5.\n\nAnyway if you played cops & robbers as a kid and were always the robbers, you'll probably find something to like in this game if you pick it up on sale.","December 27, 2015","true","3.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

I can play the same missions again and again many times, trying to see the differences of the consequences I have choosen =)\nBut there are many missions (I think more on workshop, needs to check).\n\nPROS\n- Missions can be played many times and have different experiences\n- The way you buy weapons, unlock missions and in-mission paths is really nice and fun\n- In your base you can remember what is the gameplay, nice for newcomers\n- Each mission has different challenges and gameplay is evolving\n- You can hire criminals, buy weapons and grow your base. There is no other game like that that delivers this experience\n- Idea well implemented, well done\n\nCONS\n- Crashes... I did not have many at early missions, but bigger missions tends to crash sometimes.\n- Basic stuff in games like this, like: checking your goons stats, is not available after you hire... I don't know why devs did not implement this.\n- The controls at the beginning may be challenging for some, because it is not the standard of handling weapons and attack. This is a minor issue I found myself. But the gameplay fits very well\n- Music is really repetitive some time, although is really nice (I will buy the soundtrack just to support the devs next month)\n- Some in-game actions needs more info, so you don't get lost when you first try your heist (this is fixed by yourself when playing again, but sometimes it ruins the experience of your first heist in a map ever) - but again, not a problem for me, it can be for some\n- Goons hit each other when shooting in front of each other - I think this is a game design feature, so, maybe not bad at all if you think big\n\nDevs, I did not see too much of this game in game channels and media, please, try to explore more of this in a future game or this one. I know a lot of people that could enjoy this and don't know.\n\nWorth the price and the content inside the game, but there are crashes, be aware of that.\n\nI have a "Transformer" PC and, sometimes, the game lags when too many guards locked in rooms until crash (also, when police arrive, game crashes if there are too many guards).\nI will keep my positive review because I do hope it will get fixed and also it is a great game.","January 3","true","15.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

Lots of witnesses, knocked out a few guards and booked it for the van as sirens sounded in the distance. We were barely getting by. That's when the Russians came.\n\nA few new goons, and the operation grew real quick. The new guys were, viscious, cold-blooded. A strange look in their eye, you know? Like they're looking at you, but not really seeing you.\n\nPeople don't get fired in this business, they get fired on. One day I got back to the hideout to find they'd capped our two founding members. Guys I'd known for years. Just put'em up in the target range and ended it. Things got real pretty quick after that.\n\nAfter the Presidential Suite operation I seriously began to rethink the life. We'd gotten the Encryption Key, but lost two more brothers in a gunfight. Countless security guards dead. It was  slaughter. Man, how did I get here? But you know, with all that cash we were sitting on, it's difficult to see a way out.\n\nThe way I figured it, I'd end up king of Chicago or stiff in an alley.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fox967/recommended/313080/","fox967","Silverfox","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fox967/","331 products in account","I played this game as far as I could, until the crashes got to me and I figured - screw it.\n\nThere are plenty of positive reviews that state what is good, and for the most part, I can agree with them. However, the following are the reasons that, for me, made me give up on this.\n\n\nFirstly - The crashes. It crashed a lot. coupled with the fact that the game only seems to autosave AFTER the current heist is complete, it left me having to redo heists again and again - not fun.\n\nSecondly - The way the character's inventories are handled; Right clicking on a character will bring up a circular inventory which surrounds the character. Sadly, the way you tell characters to pick up items/use items is also right clicking. This means that it is virtually impossible to pick up an item that the character is standing over, because you just continue opening a characters inventory. Not a great problem, just very annoying when it happens for the 7th time in 10 minutes.\n\nThirdly - This game is NOT a 'plan a heist' game. There is no 'casing the joint', for example - Its a puzzle game. When you find a solution to a heist, that solution will always work. It'll work for me. For you. It'll work a year from now. There is no random elements apart from, perhaps, the public that wander into the stores now and then. Not that that is a bad thing - but i didn't want a puzzle game. I wanted something more.\n\nFourthly - The whole hold-up mechanic. Seriously, If i have 2 guys with shotguns pointing them at a security guard, I don't expect that guard to wait 45 seconds or so, then draw his baton and charge me. But that's what happens. People will not be held up indefinitely, but instead you have a short time to either shoot them or beat them into unconsciousness.\nNow, im aware that I didn't play THAT far into the game. Perhaps there will be items to permenently placate people - ropes or handcuffs - but I didn't see anything like that.\n\n\nDon't get me wrong - Its not a terrible game. Its just has several flaws.\n","December 1, 2015","false","1.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

I found it because I was, at the time, making a very similar heisting game of my own.\n\nWhen the game released on early access it was very exciting, but after playing I thought it was a bit... featureless? BUT - early access, right? So I threw them some helpful suggestions on the discussion board, and some were definitely considered for the final game.\n\nHowever, now the game is released, and being sold at a whopping non-sale price of £15, I have recommend you stay clear from the title for a while. Maybe bookmark it and come back later when either the price drops, or more content is added.\n\nWhy am I telling you to avoid the game though? A few reasons, main one being the game definitely felt rushed out, due to pressure of budget and time. This worries me for the future of the game, and it doesn't have the content to support a full release. It still feels like a beta at best. Now don't get me wrong, there's a bunch of heists. 20, I  think. But they are pretty much all the same and go like:\n\nFind grey key,\nLock guards behind grey door,\nFind other keys,\nLock any more guards behind grey door.\n\nThere's literally no other strategy in the game. Most heists are simply impossible to do any other way. And on top of that, trying to lock people behind doors is incredibly frustrating and fidly.\n\nI'll come back to this review if the game changes any in the future, the addition of workshop and a level editor would do wonders for the game.","June 7, 2015","false","6.0"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dzordanas/recommended/313080/","dzordanas","COCAINE DINOSAUR","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dzordanas/","19 products in account","For those that don't know, or are interested in buying; The Masterplan is a top down strategy puzzle game. From appearance, it looks like a Payday: The Heist gone Door Kickers(but being the criminals) mixed with a crime-like aspect of Hotline Miami. .. with polished gameplay with many awesome features and unique and appealing graphics. There is a lot to this game and I'm going to try and cover most of it.\n\nWhen I first bought this game, I was dissapointed. The first mission is quite confusing to someone who has never seen gameplay or a video of how it's done and the game's version of a 'tutorial' is confusing and quite unhelpful. This, being a con. However because of easy controls and UI you will figure it out within a minute or so. After you complete missions you go back to your hideout, which, is mostly pointless other than for you to mail order yourself weapons and accessories, or to hire another goon (Hitman/robber/whatever you want to call it). The more goons the better. Once onto levels with security you will want to hire another goon and make sure two of your three goons have guns. It takes two guns pointed at guard(s) to make their resistance level stay at 0 (Full circle), while your third goon beats them up. The gameplay is quite fluid and there is no pause button, but there is slow motion which is essentially the same thing except that the game is still moving. (reaaaaally slowww)\nDue to the top down, slow paced aspect the game can probably run on any PC or laptop. The graphics aren't really changeable (Not like you would want/need to). And the game rarely crashes and doesn't ever crash on startup (for me, and I haven't seen any crash on startup reports on the forums). The developers and moderators on the forums, to those interested in the community, are very very nice. They seem to be open to critisism and are nice to the players and those asking questions on the forums. They reply to nearly every post, crash log, bug report, suggestion, etc etc.\nLets talk about how the game does in its genres.\n\nStrategy 9/10. Very strategical, will have you dieing/running to your car from cops/shooting cops, picking places to hold people up, hide bodies, etc. Needs some working on the paths your goons follow but that is it.\nAction 5/10. Not in 5 as bad but 5 as in it depends how you play. If you are the other 50% you will refrain from any 'action' and only hold people up and knock them out. If you are the other 50% you will be seeing lots of action, like shooting at cops, security, civilians, running to your car before the police show up, etc. So it heavily depends on how you choose to play.\nPuzzle 4/10. Most people are probably suprised when I classified this as a Puzzle game, however, most players would agree. It's not really a puzzle game, it just has puzzle aspects of it. The whole mission is essentially a puzzle that you have to figure out how to get through a room and get the pieces inside of it using means of holding people up, telling hostages what to do, hiding bodies, locking doors and lots more. Since the game only has puzzle aspects, and isn't a puzzle game. So if you aren't into puzzle games, but this title has caught your eye, keep looking. If you are looking for puzzle games, this isn't one.\nNow, to other qualities of the game..\nGraphics 10/10. It has its own unique, and good looking style of graphics. Whereas, if you are looking for an HD clean realistic looking graphics, you won't find it here.\nBugs/Glitches 7/10. The game has bugs/glitches but they are few and far between. Most that get reported get patched that same day/week.\nGameplay 10/10. Challenging as hell, exciting, keeps you on the edge of your chair hoping you don't slip up and ruin your heist.\n\nThis game is unique, fun, challenging, appealing, and very exciting. If nothing I covered in this interests you, check out more reviews, gameplays, to get a feel of the game. If you still aren't interested, I suggest you look for a different game.\n\nOVERALL: 9/10","July 6, 2015","true","13.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The game is quite nice, and it's developing around a good idea. Hopefully it will end up in a good final product. As for now, the main issue is constant crashes. In the last week there have been 2 consecutive updated (5.0 and 5.1) but for some (like me) it just meant that the game became unplayable because it crashes every time I choose to play a heist.\nUnfortunately, because Steam App handles all the updates automatically, I'll have to wait for the next update hoping (let's cross fingers) that it will work again. And updates are not all that often.\nSo, if you are looking for a game to play, I advice you wait till the game is less buggy. If you are ok with bugs and just want to support the project, then give it a try.\nRegarding the game-play experience I have mixed feelings: I really like the game and the "idea" of how to conduct it; but I find that game controls are a bit clumbsy. Even though I've spent a good amount of hours playing it, I often end up stumbling while I try to put into action game strategies due to the difficoulties of having to control the characters with mouse and keyboard -- too many passages (clicks, menus, queued actions, ecc). At times I've found that frustration is more than fun during gameplay. Hopefully, this might change with future editions of The Masterplan, but it would require some rethinking of the user-interface/controls-implementation on the developers' side.\nOverall, it's a very original game and I really hope it will develop into a great final product. But I don't feel like advising to buy it at this stage -- at your own risk: you might be amongst the unlucky ones who end up always crashing!","December 2, 2014","false","11.8"," 18 of 42 people (43%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","43","18","42","2","5"

Graphics go hand-in-hand with the theme, giving vibrancy to the game. Love the top-down concept which helps with the tactical theme. Felt it was really similar to the opposing game, Door Kickers. Aesthetically, the game is near-perfect.\n\nHowever, despite its looks, I got quite frustrated with the bugs and crashes that kept breaking the game. Doors were unable to be locked or unlocked, hostages were unable to be subdued, and all NPCs in the map were suddenly alerted to the crime. These are just 3 of the largest bugs encountered. It would seem that a lot more work would be required in the programming aspect of the game.\n\nOverall, it holds lots of promise! Would recommend when the bugs are fixed!\n\n\nEDIT: After the latest updates, the developers have kept to their aims of fixing those earlier mentioned game-breaking bugs. For me at least, the game now plays smoothly without a hitch :) Thanks for the updates and glad to see that the developers are alert and listening to us gamers. Thumbs up!

You pause the game and issue orders on your officers.  I remember playing SWAT 2 more than a decade ago as the criminal element and this game reminds me of it.\n\nThe Masterplan is essentially, Door Kickers as criminals.  You control a team of criminals aiming to earn wealth to eventually steal from those who stole from you.  There are multiple various ways to complete a mission.  You can go in guns blazing killing everyone or you can go in like super thieves, where no one even knows you are there. You can sort of do missions solo but you will be limited by your inventory space.\n\nThe only thing that this game actually lacks are more achievements.

I got it when it was fairly Early Access and they have improved it since.\n\nIts a mix of Doorkickers and Monaco or cartoon top down Payday-but with lots more stealth and way less FPS running and gunning which I don't care for much, thus like this game more in many ways.\n\nNice graphics, a decent number of maps (~15). Point and click, so no gamepad. Its fun locking guards in rooms, locking them out of rooms or after you enter or even locking a room to hide a body so they don't call for backup. Certainly not linear, play how and as creative as you want!  Take control of guards briefly or take those in your way out with a shotgun, tranquilizer or silencer. It can be very hard, challenging and sometimes frustrating.\n\n\nNOTE:  FRUSTRATING, things like this happened a bit often (updates fixed it some) - 30 mins into a perfect heist at the Central BB Bank and it freezes up and ends my game (a save feature would help stop this waste of time) need to redo it all YET again just get the next level paper too! Far into every heist I have to hurry in fear of this having a error - not just dying or getting caught! This happens occassionally and it slows down (not the intentional planning feature) briefly despite being a basic game with the amount of content that shouldn't happen. Update, just completed the last mission (with just one person) and as I got in and drove away in 1 of the 4 bank trucks to complete the mission-error and the game closed again!\n\nOtherwise its GREAT even with the tech flaws, hoping they make another one soon and continue to fix the remaining errors a bit more!\n\n9.5/10 for a indie game and for what it sets out to do.\n\nkc\nWhy Vegan?

Yes? No? If you did then you will like this too, its not as good as Monaco in my opinion, but never the less, it is similar.\n\nUnlike Monaco, there are no preset characters and you just hire thugs to work with you. No character is unique (except some stat difference), and you just give each character items to bring to a heist.\n\nPros:\n-If you like hiest game, give this a go.\n-Delightful graphics and visually pleasing.\n-If its on sale then totally give it a go.\n-Encourage stealth gameplay and only stealth gameplay\n\nCons:\n-Crash problems, occur quite frequently, but auto saves well\n-$22 CAD seems rather expensive\n\nOverall:\nDespite the crash that annoys me, I still recomend it. The game has some difficulty and requires planning. There is no time limit going on which is great. More or less it is a memorization game so you will probably restart ALOT, I find it ok considering it is not punishing you for not pressing a certain fast enough but rather your hiest is flawed, but then again, personal taste.\n","September 25, 2015","true","5.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The learning curve i found to be actually pretty enjoyable, but ya half the time im screaming at my guys trying to figure out what idiotic thing they are up to now, but still a good time.  You basically are a full time armed robber and while there are only 19-20 different jobs from what i can tell, you can redo them over and over again and grind up cash to hire new guys and new weapons, and the levels themselves are done decently imo.\n\nIt can be frustrating at times as the ai doesnt really listen to you and has a hard time walking around objects and other characters.  When it starts getting stuck he starts walking around in erractic patterns and will get out of range of the guy supposed to be covering him (and it takes about half a second to break) and the guy will take off running and call the cops.  Its far from perfect and some levels are flatout painful just to get people where you need them to go, but it could be worse and usually you can either bypass the specific issue plagueing you or you can try guns blazing.\n\nWill be better if they release some map making tools and mod support (kind of shocked it doesnt have this already), or would have been cooler if it was randomly (or even semi-randomly) generated levels but still pretty fun game.","June 8, 2015","true","16.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's fun, but the combat system is seriously broken. Levels where you have to use guns mean you'll be doing more damage to your team than the enemy will, due to firendly fire and no AI. It's very easy to accidentally kill someone by misclicking. This gets very old, as killing someone incurs a 33% cleaners fee from your earnings. These are the largest problems. If they get fixed, buy the game. If not, buy it on sale.","December 25, 2015","true","5.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Past that The Masterplan shines throughout as each heist gets bigger and better. For gripes one ends up repeating some of the later levels a bit too much since messing up often results in having to restart the whole level, but that is very minor compared to just how enjoyable the large variety of heists are to puzzle through.\n\nThe Masterplan is not a diamond in the rough but a pure gold bar. At its best it doesn´t quite hit the sweetest of spots, but it is great throughout and doesn´t let go for it´s plenty long enough duration(14h for me).","May 29","true","14.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
