The game was designed to be playable by multiple audiences, speedrunners, casuals, etc can all find enjoyment out of the game. It's designed to be a game you play while on a lunch break or between other playthroughs, and it really, truly is (which is fairly uncommon in my opinion). Great game. Stop reading.

Specifically, my virus protection read some file as a threat. It had never done that before, so I panicked and posted something angry because I am a hotheaded jerk on the internet. Well, the developer was on top of it in a flash...literally. My post was up for about 5 minutes before s/he calmly informed me of the obvious, which is that it was a false positive, evident by the fact that I was the only one reporting it. (I run a tight ship on my PC, but I do use a weird virus program...never had a problem before now.) S/he walked me through some steps, even sending me a replacement for the single file causing the trouble.\n\nAnyway, the game is great. But in our days of kickstarters and early access, it is a common sight to see developers and the communities at each others throats. I gotta support a team or individual who realizes that today, maybe unfortunately, game development includes a service aspect. And I was the irrate and unreasonable customer.\n\n10/10 Would buy from again.","June 27, 2014","true","4.2"," 93 of 96 people (97%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","97","93","96","2","0"

(I do! I do!) Though Tower of Guns bears little resemblance to Facing Worlds, while playing it I was nevertheless transported back to the year 2000, fondly remembering endless post-work capture the flag matches in which I would repeatedly get my butt kicked. The speedy-smooth Unreal engine is on fine display in Tower of Guns, and you've got plenty of that circle-strafey, stay-in-one-spot-and-you're-dead hyperfast shooting that UT popularized at the turn of the century. (There's even a flak cannon!) Of course, Tower of Guns is a single-player roguelike, so you won't be sniping noobs in this game. Quite the opposite: you are the moving target in a gigantic shooting gallery. As you progress up the tower, each room presents yet another assorment of turrets and robots that want to make you dead with their giant bullets and spiky balls of doom. The random map generation helps make each run feel fresh, but even still, don't expect tons of variety. This is a totally indie enterprise, after all. The visuals are interesting, vaguely reminiscent of a junkyard in Borderlands or a Death Star trash compactor level. Despite being a little lean on content, Tower of Guns is full of personality and the devs have laid the groundwork for plenty of expansion, if they so desire (and if the audience is there to justify it). Like Binding of Isaac (one of my favorite games ever), a single run usually takes 10 minutes, but I imagine it could take much longer if you get lucky (I'm not very lucky). Like firearms, Tower of Guns is best in short, controlled bursts. Highly recommended if you're looking to scratch that old school FPS itch.","March 5, 2014","true","6.2"," 55 of 62 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","55","62","0","0"

You are very mobile, and upgrades you find in the tower will allow you to become even faster and stay airborne longer, if you're really lucky you'll be zipping around and rarely touching the ground.\n\nWith each new run you'll chose a weapon and perk to start with. Weapon mods found in the tower will allow you to change how your weapon operates, such as giving it a shotgun spread or causing your projectiles to seek or bounce. These, in addition to the reusable items you'll find and various stat increases like health, speed, or jumps, give each run a unique feel, even when you start with the same build. If you're lucky you may even find new, unique weapons in the tower that operate unlike anything else you can start with.\n\nThe tower is partly procedurally generated. Each floor you visit has a theme and you'll fight through a random assortment of rooms in that theme before fighting a boss. While the content of each room is random, the rooms themselves are handmade with a better sense of level design than you get with most procedural games, including secret areas and easter eggs.\n\nIf you're like me and scour the levels for hidden items, a successful run will take about 35 minutes. You cannot save in the middle of the game so you'll need to finish it in a single run. Thankfully each run is fairly short and can lead to a very addictive one-more-try game session.\n\nCheck this game out if you like old-school fast-paced shooters.","June 27, 2015","true","29.4"," 42 of 42 people (100%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","100","42","42","3","0"

You've got an FPS game that actually has guns not modeled off real-life weaponry, but instead over-the-top creative concepts. You not only have the ability to jump without needing to press your knees against a wall and vault over, but you can jump to your wildest dreams. No stop-and-pop cover-hugging here, get your ♥♥♥ out there soldier. Or grandmother. Or 80's gamer. Because even the storyline is randomly generated.\n\nI normally try to be fair and critical in my reviews, but I can't help but rave here. A little indie game took me in its arms and told me that FPS was still alive and circle-strafe-bunnyhopping in the clouds, and I didn't have to wait for it to come back down. I could pick up 3 jump height boosts and reach it in 7 jumps. It's taken me longer than planned to write this review, beacuse it was hard to pull away.\n\nAlright, minor rants. Some areas are too dark to easily spot enemies, but there's still more color variety than Borderlands. Twerp bots can be annoyingly hard to hit. I want to hold more than one gun. Some area generation can have bugs.\n\nScrew this, I'm back to playing it. I'd recommend it at full price for anyone that enjoyed Quake or Unreal games. Yes, Doom didn't have jumping, and I grew up on that game. But we had to learn to walk before we could centuple-jump.

This results in sometimes having really cool aerial experiences.\n\nHowever, the movements feel a bit floaty and not precise.

They fill their role, but it kinda lacks variety or eye-catching design.\n\nThe game is not too hard in itself and can be finished in a few hours, and then there are other guns and perks to unlock, par times to beat and endless mode.\n\nA very good feature is that for each run, the level sections encountered can be different. I mean that the room types and their atmosphere are switched, which makes replaying feel more fresh than in the rogue-lites where you have to go through the same environments over and over.\n\nSo overall, it is fairly enjoyable with really cool rooms and exciting aerial shooting, but the shooting part itself is not satisfying enough.","December 25, 2014","true","3.9"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","14","16","0","0"

All the different elements work together to make for a very fun fast and enjoyable game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Coleem/recommended/266110/","Coleem","Colem","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Coleem/","162 products in account","To me one of the best games of this year, Tower of Guns has far exceeded my expectations. Although I saw some early gameplay on YouTube, I wasn't sure how well the roguelike/lite gameplay would fit in a FPS. Needless to say, it worked beautifully.\n\n\nOverview\n\nEssentially, Tower of Guns is about fighting your way up a tower filled with automatons all hell-bent on your death. You begin by choosing a weapon and a perk. As you complete the game, you will unlock other guns/ perks which can be used on different playthroughs. On your way up, you'll also collect power ups, such as additional jumps, damage, luck, jump height, and difficulty increases or decreases. Additionally, you may replenish health and experience (more on that later) via pickups.\n\n\nGraphical Quality\n\nOverall, the graphical quality of the game is fairly good. I personally think he style fits the game well, although the enemy design is sometimes a bit lackluster. The homogeneous nature of the early environment (a lot of brown/yellow) meshes well with the mechanical killing of automatons, and the cartoony style is quite interesting.\n\n\nGameplay\n\nSometimes criticized for a lack of variety in the gunplay, the each run revolves around the weapon you choose. There are about a dozen weapons to choose from, presuming you've unlocked them, and each fits a different style of play. Occasionally, the player may find a second weapon in a run, although it is fairly uncommon. These secondary weapons are often extremely powerful when leveled up, and can save a run on their own if used correctly. As you defeat enemies, you'll pick up “blue exp” to make your weapon stronger, changing the size, color, and effects of your bullets/projectiles. The max level (assuming you don’t use a certain perk to increase it) is 5, and once the cap is reached, you can no longer pick up exp.\n\nHowever, level 5 does not guarantee a victory. As you take damage, and your health decreases, the weapon you are using also loses exp. Even if you survive a rough room, you may still have difficulty in the coming levels, as your weapon may have lost numerous levels. This adds an extra level of complexity to the game, and often your weapon de-leveling can spell disaster to an otherwise perfect run. There are also "use items" which can be recharged by collecting "yellow exp." Weapon mods are also sometimes available, and can change the nature of your weapons projectiles, adding effects such as explosive shots or rapid fire.\n\nThe level design overall is quite good. Each “floor” is made up of multiple rooms. The rooms you encounter are randomized, but after numerous playthroughs you are bound to see most/ all of them. However, I've yet to see, or remember, the order of the rooms ever be the same. Additionally, most rooms have “secrets” which the player often can stumble upon simply by moving through a room in a different way. It's not uncommon to visit a room 10 times across many plathroughs, only to find a secret you never knew existed on the 11th visit. At the end of each floor there is a boss fight. Once the boss is defeated, the door to the next room will open and the player can move to the next floor.\n\nIf there is one thing that separates this particular FPS roguelike/lite from others at the time of writing (I won't mention names, but I'm sure there's one that most are thinking of), it's the mobility of the character. Additional jumps make the game a blast, and sometime ludicrous speeds can be reached by the end of a playthrough (if the player fins enough speed++ powerups).\n\n\nStory\n\nThere isn't much of a story to speak of. If it is toggled on in the options menu, the player will see a small text box conversation at the beginning of each floor, expanding on an (often humorous) little tale about the protagonist. Interestingly, the story itself is random in the sense that each run will portray the main character (you) as a different person. While the different perspectives/stories have no appreciable affect on gameplay, and can be turned off, they are often quite funny, and add a bit of spice to each level.\n\n\nDifficulty\n\nI personally didn't find the “base” game to be tremendously difficult. Within five or so hours I had beaten it once or twice. However, the game definitely warrants multiple playthroughs, and there are some ways of increasing the difficulty. On perk, for example, causes the game to be much harder (the player starts with difficulty ++ cards) and all enemies to spawn as elite. Additionally, in a normal run, difficulty ++ cards can be picked up to make the game somewhat harder.\n\n\nOptions/ Issues\n\nThe options menu is alright. There are a number of resolution options, as well as fullscreen. Motion blur, bloom, and MSAA are also available. Mouse smoothing (acceleration) is also toggle-able. There are some issues, however. For one, there is no borderless windowed mode. Additionally, if run in windowed mode, the game defaults to the base resolution (1152x864) each time. For some reason, the game also doesn't seem to like 1920x1080 in windowed, and will default to a slightly lower resolution. Keep in mind this may be a personal problem. It didn't affect gameplay, however.\n\n\nOverall\n\nBuy this game. It's a fantastic time killer, with a solid difficulty curve and rewarding gameplay. If you can get get past the fact that you use one gun for the entirety of the run, the interesting shooting mechanics, excellent movement, and randomized nature of each run will keep you playing for hours.","January 1, 2015","true","30.2"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","12","13","0","0"

The idea is excellent and the game is impressive from a technical standpoint (hundreds of enemies and projectiles on screen!), but it falls short on the execution of basic mechanics of both the FPS and roguelike genres.\n\nOn the FPS front, the guns have no kick to them at all. They're all peashooters firing peas of different size, speed and damage - they have no recoil, no knockback, no stagger. Though the weapons seem very different at a glance, they all play pretty much the same - you hold down M1 while circle strafing a screen full of enemies. The gunplay and movement feel floaty and unsatisfying, and there is no feeling of in-game presence, no meaningful feedback from the guns and thus very little satisfaction from the core gameplay.\n\nOn the roguelike front, the game lets you choose one gun at the start, and that is the only gun you will get in most playthroughs. After 30~ playthroughs and about 10 hours of gameplay, I have seen another gun exactly twice. Most items are simply passive stat upgrades, and the active items are incredibly rare, take a long time to recharge and are mostly useless. More than once, I've went several levels without an item or shop in the way.\n\nTo top it off, the game has a bug (at least on the Linux version) where a single level will run at incredibly low framerate for no apparent reason. As the game is unplayable at 10 fps and there is no "save and quit" function, your only option is to abandon the current playthrough.\n\nI cannot recommend this game in its current state, and its flaws run too deep to be fixed by patches.","November 5, 2014","false","18.9"," 97 of 169 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","97","169","0","3"

He enlisted the help of another man to create one of the most kickass soundtracks in a game to date.\n\nI cannot stress enough that this is the work of one developer and one musician.  Is it because I'm about to say, "Oh, this is pretty good for a small team."?\n\nNo.  This is not good for a small team.  This is nigh on black magic level for a single man and his brother-in-law.  If a full fledged STUDIO released this, I'd be giving it as much praise as I am now.  I can only imagine a sort of Faustian pact that enabled this game to be created.\n\nEnough gushing.  Let me elucidate a little bit on the mechanics that make this game so gosh darn fun.\n\n1.  Roguelike elements.  Permadeath, restart, randomly put together levels, perk unlocks and new guns to create a fresh feeling each playthrough.  The rooms in each level are handcrafted, and oh how lovingly handcrafted they are!  There are literally dozens upon dozens of secrets in each playthrough and they are DEVIOUS.\n\n2.  Shooting is fun - Guns?  Yeah, this game has some guns.  It's got your pistols, machine guns, shotguns, Mini-large hadron colliders, and guns that shoot bouncing spikey balls and glowing discs of death.  Wait.  What?\n\n3.  Weapon mods - Hey.  You have a rocket launcher.  What's this weapon mod do?  Oh.  It turns it into a machine gun rocket launcher.  That's pretty cool.  I like that.\n\n4.  Fast, Quake/Unreal style gameplay - It starts off a little slow, plinking away with your little basic gun of choice.  Then you start picking up badges (powerups), weapon mods, and items.  Pretty soon you're jumping fifteen feet in the air with only ONE of your jumps.  I've personally gotten up to six jumps in one game.  Double jump?  Pfft.  Triple, quadruple, and quintuple jumps are where it's at.  You'll be gliding around a massive, beautiful arena, firing your glowing, machine gun razor blade shooting pizza launcher at dozens of robots trying to murder you.\n\n5.  Boss Fights - Good lord.  Yeah, you got your Mama Spinbots, just bullet hell spinny robot death throwers that try to murder you through sheer brute force.  Then you've got the Egg Scrambler, the Gumball Machine, and Mr. Turret.  I cannot emphasize how cool the boss fights are.  The Egg Scrambler is one of my favorite boss fights in any FPS ever.  EVER.\n\n6.  It's ten dollars right now, fifteen at full price.  Come on.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/runpmc/recommended/266110/","runpmc","Chef Excellence","http://steamcommunity.com/id/runpmc/","163 products in account","Tower of Guns is a semi-procedurally generated "lunch break" FPS that's condensed the shooter genre to its utmost essence. Run, jump, strafe, shoot, try like hell to not die. That's really it. No game saves, no quickload, no plot beyond "here's a tower full of murderous automatons, you want to be at the top." And when you die your game is over and you must start a fresh run, which googling tells me is a genre called "roguelike".\n\nNot being familiar with roguelikes I can't speak to how good an entry it is in the genre, but my formative gaming experiences as a kid mostly consisted of plugging quarter after precious quarter into sadistically difficult arcade machines, hoping to unlock their secrets—or at least eke more than a few seconds' entertainment out of *this* playthrough before the inevitable failure because damn those machines were brutal. Tower of Guns definitely hearkens back to that philosophy, minus the quarters of course. It is punishingly difficult, requiring super-twitchy reflexes and an almost zen-like ability to strategize on the fly as a shload of happy projectiles come shrieking your way to give you a great big hug with nuclear arms. It's also therefore intensely rewarding when you do manage to reach the other side of an insane battle with your organs intact.\n\nIf this sounds a bit grim and violent, well...it isn't. The cartoonish art design, lack of blood or gore (none at all to my recollection), and frequently black sense of humor running throughout encourage players to not take any of this seriously—even as the ever-increasing difficulty keeps the tension ratcheted up to 11.\n\nSeriously, I'm in love with this game. You can get it way cheap (> $5) during sales, but it's also well worth the purchase at full price.","November 30, 2014","true","56.9"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","85","11","13","3","0"

The sheer frantic level of action needed by this game is amazing, and the fact that the levels are semi-random and every playthrough is different just makes this one of the most fun first person shooters I've ever played.  The humor is very off-kilter (I love that the 'story' behind the tower is as randomized as the levels, including a version where the story is actually the randomized story of the levels), the action starts out at intense and ratchets up - the weapons are fun, the items are crazy; in a lot of ways it's reminiscent of MDK, but amped up even more.  It's as much a platformer as a FPS, which is in its favor.  It's like FPS meets Binding of Isaac, in the best possible sense.  I absolutely love it.  I've only chalked up one win (and that wasn't even a full win, just the easy way out), but this is one I'll come back to over and over again.","October 5, 2014","true","24.0"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

Guns everywhere. This game is a first person bullet hell, which is a difficult combination to find nowadays. It also incorporates some rouge-like elements, allowing you to collect and purchase loot in the form of upgrades and stat boosts. This in itself is fun, but one of the more enjoyable features of this game is the literal ton of secrets that can be found. Every room has a secret or two to unlock, and because of the randomized nature of the game i'm constantly finding new things on every playthrough. But whats all this mean without the gunplay. Shooting in tower of guns is chaotic and exaggerated. It doesn't take long for your screen to be swamped with bullets, missiles, and bombs. The downside to this is that your first five or so runs are mostly likely going to end in a quick death, as the game doesn't start you with very good weapons. Unlocking new guns should be your first priority, as progression past the first boss is almost impossible without it. The game lets you choose between dashing past enemies to the exit, or fighting it out in the search for power ups and loot. These sort of decisions become very important later in a run, as arming yourself is key to preparing for the next boss fight.\nOverall this game has a special charm to it. Being hand crafted as a co-op project between two brothers, you can see the love that has been pored into it. If you are a fan of bullet hell shooters, or simply want to try something different and don't mind a challenge, then you should defiantly check this game out.","January 11","true","9.7"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","9","10","0","0"

You'll be going through dungeon to dungeon, shooting a bunch of stuff while avoiding ridiculously giant sized bullets and bombs.\n\nTower of Guns feature a very interesting illustrative look when it comes to it's texture and overall style. If you've played the Borderlands series, it'll be very familiar to you. Visually the game scream with style and it'll probably be one of the more memorable elements to the game.\n\nMy only complaints is that the button prompts are made for consoles, so when using keyboard and mouse in the PC, it's hard to tell what button you should push to activate the prompt. Also some of the audio feedback from your bullets connecting to enemies seem a underwhelming in comparison to the exaggerated and highly stylized explosion that it produces.\n\nOverall Tower of Guns is a pretty interesting take on the FPS genre. If you're into Quake or Unreal Tournament, but want a twitch based FPS with some roguelike flavors, then Tower of Guns should fullfill that need.\n\nPros:\n- Wonderfully stylized aesthetic\n- Very replayable\n- Easy to understand and get into\n- Very twitchy and fast paced\n\nCons:\n- Button Prompts set up for consoles and not PC\n- Some audio sound effects underwhelming","February 21, 2015","true","3.3"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","11","14","0","0"

However, you will not be picking up any new weapons during your run.  Instead you will choose a gun and a perk (things like triple jump, no fall damage...there are several unlockable ones as well) at the start and level it, also occasionally finding mods for it.  At first this seems a bit disappointing, but when you actually see some of the mods out there, you realize you'd be better off just trying to make your favorite gun super powerful.  You do have infinite ammo after all, there's no worrying about scavenging for bullets or running out here.  (Edit: It appears I was wrong, you *can* find new weapons, they are just ridiculously rare, because they are OP and really fun to use)\n\nAlso, yes, you really can have a ridiculous number of jumps just like the store ad says.  I've had a run where I can jump 16 times in midair, and had I found more items, I could have maybe went to 20 jumps.  The reason you can have so many jumps is because there really is no other way to reach things in some rooms.  Don't expect to find everything in any playthrough of Tower of Guns, there are just too many places either hidden behind fake walls or placed insanely high so you can't reach it without a ton of jumps.  However, do remember you can rocket jump in this game, so people who are better at it than me can probably find some cool secrets.\n\nThe performance is pretty good, game runs smoothly at all times.  This is the Unreal Engine though, I expect it to be capable of good performance like that.\n\nOverall, this is a really fun game, and the dev should be proud of himself for making such a fun game considering he did it all by himself.  Props to his brother for the OST as well, while it's not something you're going to listen to for hours, it fits the game in my opinion.\n\n(I should also mention I've had this for a few months before the steam release, it was fun even before it was finished, and it's even better now.)","March 6, 2014","true","4.0"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

The game follows a similar structure to Risk of Rain, where you progress through levels and it gets more difficult as you continue.  You can play normal mode which ends after you defeat the final boss or endless mode which just keeps turning up the dials until you die.  Levels start out pretty tame but can reach the point where walking into a room instantly spawns 100 or more flying enemies while 10 turrets rapidly fire projectiles everywhere.  This is the only game I have ever played where dropping down to 20 fps or below made me say "That was ♥♥♥♥ing awesome" rather than "This game is an unoptimized piece of ♥♥♥♥."\n\nThe game has a great sense of humor with all sorts of strange items to find and a great Borderlands-esque are style, with some very strange music to go along with it.  I thought it was an odd choice at first but it all fits together very well.  You will enjoy your journey through the tower of guns while you dodge bullets, shoot enemies, and search for the craftily-hidden secrets which there are many of.

I expected garbage, but came away without any regrets of my time spent with it.\nToG is a quasi-procedurally generated rogue-lite FPS. The controls, while not as flawlessly precise, definitely take their inspiration from classic FPS games like Quake and Unreal. Graphics are nothing to drool over but as I recall this game was more of a hobby project and taking that into account, it’s rather impressive. Difficulty wise, the game ramps rather aggressively as you progress through your run. As per usual with procedural generation, many of your runs are going to be at the mercy (or lack thereof) of the random number generator. Some of the enemies can feel cheap, but there are a variety of guns you can unlock that I only assume makes managing each type of enemy easier.\nOverall, it’s alright.

You can choose from a number of weapons, but none of them affect how you use them or how you play, they just deal different amounts of damage. Destroying enemies doesn't feel satisfying; you just click towers, hope your 1km/hour projectile hits and then watch as the tower slowly turns orange before vanishing after a few seconds. Pickups disappear after a very short period of time, so if there's any action going on most of the time they're not even worth picking up. Floaty jumps and lots of vertical rooms, but huge fall damage discourages you from exploring and jumping around too much. Enemies don't hurt much but they're pretty much unavoidable and you can't easily get health back. The ending is basically a screen of text that says "you win".\n\nAltogether, the game feels like a hodgepodge of game mechanics thrown together for no coherent reason.\n\nRuns smooth, looks fine, handles fine, adjustable field of view, unlocked framerate.","October 31, 2014","false","1.3"," 14 of 25 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","14","25","0","0"

It's always fun, very rarely frustrating, and offers a great level of replay. There are some unpolished bits, but nothing game breaking at all, and really nothing that detracts from the enjoyment of it. The controls are tight and responsive, the gameplay pacing has a good variation and buildup to it. Starts off a bit slow, but before long the screen is filled with fast-moving bullets. The weapons all feel different enough that none of them are redundant, though sometimes certain weapons feel a lot less useful. The randomization is great. It's different enough every time to be fresh, but has enough of the same that you can generally know what to expect. Even after around 20 hours of play I still come across rooms I've not seen before.\n\nThe game is really simple. Pick up and play at it's finest. Can rush a playthrough in 20 minutes, or hang around and shoot everything and it'll take around 40-45. The most complex thing you'll find here is figuring out all the items and figuring out how to get some of the secrets. The dialogue is hilariously goofy and changes every playthrough.\n\nReally the only complaint I have about this game is having a dry spell of bad drops, or having it put an extra-jump badge just out of reach, like it's just sitting there taunting me.\n\nI definintely recommend the game. Tower of Guns is always enjoyable, gives a decent challenge, and has a unique charm to it I've not found anywhere else.","May 2, 2014","true","65.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Each playthrough takes place in a randomly chosen series of maps with a randomly chosen story (it's pulling maps from a list of premade rooms, so it's not a randomly generated game), and you just have to get to the boss and move on to the next floor. Your enemies are simply turrets shooting at you (with a few flying ones being the only moving enemies), so most of your focus in on dodging their slow moving bullets. You only get one weapon to take with you, but you can choose which one you get at the start of the game as well as a single perk, both of which you can earn more of through gameplay. During the game, you'll also find items, stat boosts, and weapon mods that can lead to things like a rapid fire tank cannon or a machine gun that shoots mines. It's a very simple game, but it's appealing to the roguelike center of my brain that just wants to jump into a game, see what chance has in store for me, and see how far I can get before I crash and burn.","May 18, 2014","true","9.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The random nature of the game can cause frustrating difficulty spikes, especially the balance between different bosses are non existent. An average run is around 30-40 mins but you can rush through it much faster (or just simply die). So it's great even if you don't have much time to spare.\n\nThe music is nice and suits the game very well but can be repetitve after a while.\n\nThe gunplay is a bit boring due to the fact that you only use one gun (the secondary gun pickups are very rare) and the progression system is a bit too simple (only a few types of upgrades and 5 levels of gun power) compared to other randomly generated survival games (or rogue-lite). The weapon mods are fun (even if you are limited to one at the time...).\nThe equipeble items got the largest variety and fun factor but they all seem weak and recharge very slow.\n\nWhile the graphics are not a huge priority for me in a game, the lack of colors is dull sometimes. (80% of the game is brown)\n\nTLDR: The game is fun. The idea is great but it can be improved a lot because even with the whole randomization it gets repetitve.

Binding of Isaac is like childs play with this game. You look at the pictures and say, "Well gee, I bet my screen filling with bullets won't be until the 3rd or 4th stage." Well, you're wrong. It can start as earlier as the 2nd room. But in the beginning, usually your screen is filled with cannonballs. Next level, it's spikeballs. Next, it's lasers. You see the pattern. So you are forced to get used to dodging a 3D bullet hell early on, which is good, because whatever you learned there is thrown out the window because of spikeballs. Those things have a mind of their own, they are going to go wherever the hell they damn please.\n\nThe game does have unlockables, about 12 guns that you can unlock, and about the same amount of "perks", things that you can pick up before you even start. They're usually variations or outright things that you can get during a playthrough. I do wish that they had more types of guns, since this game is called Tower of Guns. You'd think you'd have your own Tower of Guns to mess around with. But, the game is fun. There were quite a few moments that took me completely by surprise just by how massive the rooms are, and that every spot of the room will have at least a handful of turrets or robots able to fire on that spot. Another thing that took me by surprise was turning around a corner and seeing around 10 spikeball launchers aiming at me at the top of a ramp.\n\nI picked it up for about 6 bucks on sale, but after playing it I will say that it is worth the 15 bucks, and extremely recommended for those that need something fun to play and only have 30 mins at a time to play.","July 13, 2014","true","2.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Binding of Isaac is like childs play with this game. You look at the pictures and say, "Well gee, I bet my screen filling with bullets won't be until the 3rd or 4th stage." Well, you're wrong. It can start as earlier as the 2nd room. But in the beginning, usually your screen is filled with cannonballs. Next level, it's spikeballs. Next, it's lasers. You see the pattern. So you are forced to get used to dodging a 3D bullet hell early on, which is good, because whatever you learned there is thrown out the window because of spikeballs. Those things have a mind of their own, they are going to go wherever the hell they damn please.\n\nThe game does have unlockables, about 12 guns that you can unlock, and about the same amount of "perks", things that you can pick up before you even start. They're usually variations or outright things that you can get during a playthrough. I do wish that they had more types of guns, since this game is called Tower of Guns. You'd think you'd have your own Tower of Guns to mess around with. But, the game is fun. There were quite a few moments that took me completely by surprise just by how massive the rooms are, and that every spot of the room will have at least a handful of turrets or robots able to fire on that spot. Another thing that took me by surprise was turning around a corner and seeing around 10 spikeball launchers aiming at me at the top of a ramp.\n\nI picked it up for about 6 bucks on sale, but after playing it I will say that it is worth the 15 bucks, and extremely recommended for those that need something fun to play and only have 30 mins at a time to play.","July 13, 2014","true","2.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Oh, and permadeath. Can’t forget the permadeath. You’ll find yourself running (more jumping than running, actually) around the various arenas shooting away at all sorts of foes with a large assortment of weapons.

Lacking something?\nTHEN BUY THIS GAME HOLY BAWLS!\n\nThe combat is steller, the controls are tight as heck, the story is done PERFECTLY for a rogue-lite/like, and its just.... YES.\nYou start out with two guns, one is vastly superiour, and two perks, one of which, again, is vastly superiour. You play the story, you unlock new weapons, new perks, and the most important part in rogue-like/lite, is you gain player experience.\nThere are oddles of secrets in each level, and items that act kinda like spacebar items in Isaac, except they recharge when you kill enemies. You level up your gun with Blue XP, and when you take damage you loose a little bit of weapon level in addition to health, which to me felt like Cave Story (which is an amazing thing)\n\n10/10 buy it now you wolnt regret it if you are a fan of the Paranautical Activity/Isaac genre.","May 19, 2014","true","4.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

While a it does feel a bit floaty, it's easy to control what's going on at all times, and dodging bullets is made as simple as it can be in a game like this. The gun-leveling system keeps you on your toes and the fact that most of the enemies in the game are stationary or prefer to be in front of you means that it's unlikely you'll get overwhelmed from behind during all the mahem.\n\nThe enemies and levels, while interesting and fun, are limited. And in a game with a rogue-like style of gameplay, this means that it falls a little short in the area of replayability. Not that the game doesn't have a fair amount of aspects making you want to come back for more, just in that you will reach a point where you've seen all there is to see.\n\nIn summary, Tower of Guns is a game that took an interesting idea and made it not only playable, but legitimately fun, and easy enough to look at.

You're entering the tower to kill it. Yes, you are tasked with killing a tower. While this may seem odd it is not actually funny. The tower is very much alive and trying to kill you and it knows you're there.\n\nAs far as the creative aspects of the game go the level design is somewhat lacking, but it's not overall terrible. The stages become repetetive after you've beaten the game several times and died a few thousand times (of which I highly recommend doing, dying thousands of times that is). There's some absolutely solid music in this game and ambiance as well and though the explosions might weigh on some players I was not bothered by the din myself, I would recommend that you turn your game audio down a bit in the settings menu to avoid any major audio annoyances. The guns, of which there are quite a few, are all fairly unique and add some interesting strategy to the game and the overall movement. The powerups and useable items add a lot of replay value to the game, there's as much if not more variability in ToG than in similar Roguelikes.\n\nIf you like a challenge as well as exploring until you know every nook and cranny in a game then this is a game for you.\n\nI reach zen like states while playing this game quite consistently, it has a very similar feel to Ikaruga, and Dark Souls for me due to how any enemy in the game can kill you if you don't approach them intelligently.\n\nOverall a quaint little hard as nails game with a lot of features and replayability.","April 16","true","12.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/henryanderson/recommended/266110/","henryanderson","azgoth2","http://steamcommunity.com/id/henryanderson/","89 products in account","This game is great fun.  There's some good humor in the dialogue (which comes in the form of a randomly selected set of narrations that play at the start and end of each section--there are a lot, and they're consistently entertaining), the guns all feel quite varied and well-suited to different play styles, and the random level ordering adds a good bit of replay value.  You can unlock almost all the weapons and perks within a few runs, so there's not a big sense of the game being locked away behind difficult hurdles (though you'll probably have one or two perks/weapons that take a bit longer to unlock).  There are some great secrets hidden around the game, ranging from kinda funny to just downright awesome.  The levels range from feeling manageable to complete, utter, only sometimes frustrating chaos.\n\nIf you're doing an endless run--where after the last level, you restart at the first--you can get some absolutely insane setups.  Forty or fifty jumps that you can pull off one after another in mid-air, a giant shotgun that seeks enemies, and an enormous rideable rocket are just some of the possibilities.  (it really is every bit as fun as that sounds)\n\nThere are a few problems with the game, but fortunately they're generally very specific problems affecting specific situations or enemies and with fairly simple possible fixes.  The only exception is that some levels are much, much rarer than others.  Since what specific level you play after each section is randomly selected, you'll end up traversing the same dozen or so in each area a lot, and see a few of them only rarely (there are some I've seen maybe once or twice, while others I've seen probably thirty or forty times).  There is a cool sense of finding a new level, but the apparent discrepancy with some of them is a bit disappointing for me.  That said, there are still plenty of levels (each with slight variations and numerous possible combinations of enemies), more than enough to keep most people satisfied for a while.\n\nI'd guess there's about 15-30 hours in this for most people, and I say it's pretty well worth it at $15, and especially worth it if it goes on sale.  Most of the game's value is that you can pick up a session, play it through, and be done (or, more likely, dead) in about an hour once you get good at it (less if you're not so good or get unlucky). This game is a lot of fun, and despite a few issues I have with it, I give it a big recommendation if "roguelike first person shooter bullet hell" sounds at all like something you'd like.","July 20, 2015","true","153.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Aethereus/recommended/266110/","Aethereus","NoSkillWill","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Aethereus/","1683 products in account","My first thought after seeing "Tower of Guns" pop up on my featured games list was "3D FPS bullet hell? What a pathetically stupid idea"\n\nAfter acing the campaign and playing around a bit I have to admit... I was wrong. This game is amazing.\n\nThis game is an FPS rogue-like, first and foremost. The genre tends to be quite stagnant; I would argue that noone really knows how to do them well yet. ToG gets super, SUPER close to hitting the nail on the head. The unreal engine allows for beautiful controls and rewarding gunplay, the levels are nicely randomized through each playthrough with some hellishly deviant secret areas hidden in practically every room. There are guns and power-ups aplenty. Enemies tend to be lacking somewhat in creativity, but the BOSSES. Oh man. I haven't said "Holy Sh*t" out loud so many times in my life.\n\nThe secret areas deserve special mention. Some secrets are easy to come by. Some secrets require specific power-ups to obtain, mixing up playthroughs even more. Some secrets require real, legit hard work. These secrets are the epitome of rewarding gameplay. A player knows he doesnt NEED to do these things, but he puts in the effort and gets it done... and he gets to reap the rewards.\n\nThe guns are all brilliant. They all do something different and they all feel interesting and unique to play with. There's no damn ammo capacity, just shoot and shoot and shoot some more. You start with a gun of your choice and have the chance of picking up a second or third as you play, which all level up as you progress. One unfortunate thing is that levelling the weapons never does anything interesting. For me it only ever gave me Damage+ and particle effect+. I feel the final level of each weapon could have been made special... make the shotgun fire grenade flak or the pistol turn into a laser, that sort of thing. Feels like a missed opportinity.\n\nEDIT: Turns out that most of the secret weapons do have special abilities at level 5. The blunderbus' flack explodes midair into more flak, the motivator creates speed-boost jelly upon firing, the noisy cricket turns into something that'd make Will Smith himself crap his pants. There are a few other examples. It is only the base weapons that tend to keep it simple.\n\nToG really feels like it came right out of the 90's era of shooters with his secrets and gun selection, only with better graphics and infinite levels. The story is 90's as hell aswell. The game picks from an assortment of different story scripts before you start your game, and gives you one at random. In one run, you're a brave warrior looking to take down the tower to save his city, and the next, you're an old granny who gets herself lost on the way to the recycling depot. The story is completely aesthetic and nothing else, but in this sort of game I would expect nothing less. It's a game where you ascend a randomised tower and shoot stuff. Get your story out of my peanut butter! The dev did a great job here, honestly.\n\nI still can't say that 3D bullet hell works flawlessly, since at times it's impossible to dodge everything being thrown at you most of the time. One could argue that it's a sign of a bad game if a player is penalized for something outside of their control, but then again... I cant remember a single point of playing this where I really cared. In this game, you're either f*cked or you aren't. A single hit isn't going to effect the state of how f*cked you are.\n\nTower of Guns is an INCREDIBLY well-polished roguelike with some phoenominal gameplay innovations. and I suggest you go and buy it right now.\n\nguns/10","November 12, 2014","true","24.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I felt this leaves you able to just have fun with it.\n\nThe progression system is pretty nicely paced too; After your first few failed runs, the developer gives you a little surprise to help you out on the next one, and there are just about enough guns, pickups and randomness so you keep having something new to try out.\n\nIt also gives you a full list of the items you've unlocked, at the main menu, and even tells you what they do, which is something other games frustrate me by not doing.\nAnd I appreciate the irreverence or whimsy that the developer treats the game with; such as little bits of dialog when you jump out of a level which feels referencial to speedrun exploits, and the option to disable the dialog, which is something I wish more games had!","November 2, 2014","true","14.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The secrets idea is great fun as you'll never know when you'll find one or see a platform above you and wonder whats up there and you may well spend minutes scouring a level for fake walls and platforms long after the enemies are gone.\n\nThe silly stories are good for a chuckle and when you're tired of them or you've seen them all it allows you to turn them off which is good of the devs to make things like that toggleable.\n\nThe Guns are all good in their own way (except perhaps the basic pistol and the pizza cutter early on) and even the ones which aren't particularly great it is fun to see how powerful you can get them with the available weapon mods. You can turn your Dakka weapon into an uber firing, minelaying, level 6 dealer of death or your rocket launcher into a enemy seeking, rapid fire rocket cannon, the mix and match opportunities available are excellent as it will keep you hunting for different mods.\n\nThe perk system is well thought out, you have ones which soften the game for you, increase difficulty and ones which can help you in certain ways or allow certain playstyles but I won't spoil anything. Some make a few achievements slightly easier for you to get too but of course you must unlock them first by completing the challenges set to you. The game progression is geared around getting you to play more but it doesn't force you to grind anything as you'll be doing it anyway.\n\nThe items are funny and effective, some seem almost benign whilst others you are scared to activate and some you don't want to waste just now...or now....not yet.....not ju-- damn, another death.\n\nEndless mode is excellent fun too, the more you go on the more upgrades you can find and end up like myself did on endless level 38 with 35 jumps available, a rapid firing with an insta crit mod, max health & armour so tough I was nigh invincible or so I thought but at the end of it I'd discovered all sorts of goodies and upgrades which you are allowed to see at the end of your gunning and in the collection menu.\n\nThe enemy types are great and varied, I probably haven't discovered them all yet hopefully. Some are utter fodder for you whilst others are an absolute bane and must be prioritised above the others. Some combinations of enemies compliment each other well whcih adds an added threat for you to overcome. The look of the turrets and other mobs is wonderful. The art style they've employed for them is great, it's not graphically intensive and it doesn't need to be as they are often dead by the time you've got close enough to look at the paintwork and sometimes it gets so overwhelmingly full of things trying to kill you that lag spikes can occur if you really are dishing out the punishment.\n\nThe loot drops are good and gives you something to look forward to at the end of the level whilst also making destroying enemies a neccessity to advancement, of course once your all sorted you can just bounce through levels completely disregarding all foes but the boss, you might even grab an achievement for that.\n\nThe shop system is good and doesn't pressure you into using it as the item is almost always visible so there are no let downs unless you let yourself in for it.\n\nAlso I want a Hugbot Plushie, Velcro hands to pose in a huggy manner.\n\nGet Tower of Guns, you can pick it up and put it down whenever you want and it's just damn good fun.\n\n\n\n","November 17, 2014","true","23.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Tower of Guns, however, stands out as a game with a human soul to it; from the 'randomly generated' plot every time you play (Mostly humerous, but in a few cases touching, or in a few rarer cases thought provoking) to the little hints and insights the developer has left in the game to tell you about not just the game itself but the process that went into it. I may have enjoyed my time running up the massive tower of guns, but the game world takes a backseat to the real world history of the game, which is not only fascinating and enjoyable but gives players a truly unique outlook on the rooms of robots they are fighting against. The game has a very kind progression system that rewards dedication to keep on trying even though you may not have beaten the game on the first try. In fact, the first time I played for the 10th time I got one of the greatest suprises I have ever gotten in a game that wasn't a jump scare. The gameplay in Tower of Guns is above average, with an array of interesting guns, but most of which I didn't want to experiment with, and once some perks are unlocked it becomes obvious which ones you are going to use. The rooms in the game are beautiful, the enemies are easy to fight in small numbers but when the rooms get big the game becomes a matrix-esq chaotic dance sequence which caused me to more than once physically bob and weave in my chair to avoid the plethora of oversized shells that were heading my way.\nThis game is much greater than the sum of it's parts. 4.5/5","July 20, 2014","true","10.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I was able to finally get this game through my buddy Wolf! (feel free to take a bow buddy! <3 ) Anywho! This game is amazing! Bindings of Issac meets Unreal Tournament style game play! I failed eight times trying  to climb the tower, getting closer each time till I finally won!! I did it! And then.. I saw a teleporter behind the one that I knew in my heart as the I win the game teleporter.. ..When I loaded into that level I never thought that the whole leve was a boss that demanded a penta jump to get to with a massive boom stick in order to do any damage to what was simply known as "The Maw" I was ultimently destoryed and what was left of me were ashes from a Shoop Da Woop laser from the game level! GG Joe! This is the best Rogue like Dungeon diving First person shooter I've ever gotten my hands on and I will be enjoying this for hours to come! I can't wait for any expansions into this world as I keep climbing man! And maybe in the future when you feel good, please add in some real awkard shotgun that sends you really, and I mean really flying. Like noisy cricket level.. <3 I think that'd be fun to add into the chaos! Oh and maybe some melee steam punk style robot waving a sword at ya would be awesome!! (rambles on the game)\n\nPast that I honeslty can't think of anything wrong with this game! For being Indie this has as much details as a triple A game.\n\nSo if you are looking for a shooter meets bindings of Issac! Get this game! 10 out of 10 would defnetly get again!\n<3 <3 <3 <3 <3\nThanks Joe!\n<3 <3 <3 <3 <3","September 2, 2014","true","5.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/pogafoga/recommended/266110/","pogafoga","Pogo & Eggs","http://steamcommunity.com/id/pogafoga/","189 products in account","I like Tower of Guns. I like it when I'm mobile and running around with some dumb weapon, and I find myself really enjoying what's become of my weapon. It's fun to jump three times while shooting explosive sawblades. What's not fun is when you get hit by something, and you have to swing your camera around to find whatever it was that hit you. When something is hitting you, it's usually either right in front of you, but the few times it isn't are extremely frustrating. Clarity is something this game could use in general.\n\nThe biggest issue I have with this game is how hard it is to see what you want. Visually the game isn't stunning, but the UI in particular is something I find difficult to read. The meters are alright, but I can't tell what the rate they're increasing or decreasing. I find the fact that sometimes you're just going to get hit annoying when taking damage lowers how strong your weapon is annoying to say the least. The game is frequently a bullet hell, and when I look back on a run, a lot of rooms have one or two areas where it feels like you're guranteed to get hit. But a key phrase of that last sentence was, "when I look back on a run," because I'm generally not thinking about it until I'm dead.\n\nI would describe ToG as, "Shoot first, and ask questions later," because the few times I could think were when I was staring at the post death recap screen. It's a game that feels as though it is trying to make a joke, but it never tells a punchline. It tries to be cutesy with the jokes on the loading screens, and the little dialogue stories, but the jokes get lost when the game itself is about running-shooting-mid-air-dodging-blasting and you're supposedly some rat or niece. It's weird that it tries to make a joke about how little story there is, because it's not a funny joke.\n\nI like the implications of the splash screen. I like the idea of a post-apocalypse, or a doom fortress, or whatever it could be. Despite their set-up and aethetic, I never get the feeling that Tower of Guns is satisfied with iteslf. That's not to say it's perfect, but it feels like the energy is mis-spent tyring to make fun of a story, and just be a fun game all the time. The design seems to be trying to sell itself as almost emotionless action, and yet they keep trying to push a wacky side on us. Yes, the game is wacky, but the game is Wacky Action, which isn't to say it's comedic Action.","December 12, 2014","true","3.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rsc/recommended/266110/","rsc","RSCNyx","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rsc/","106 products in account","Tower of Guns is a mixture of an old-school FPS (Think Quake) and a "roguelike" like Binding of Issac. It mixes fast-paced twitch gunplay with randomized rooms, loot and, of course, only one life.\n\nBefore you begin, you choose one of your two initial weapons, and one of two initial perks. You unlock more weapons and perks as you play on. Fortunately, most of the unlockables are not hard to get: They just require you to play the game, and you'll eventually get most/all of them! Once you do that, you're on your way.\n\nDon't expect to get far your initial runs, however: This game is hard as hell. The game throws some crazy hectic things your way, and your head needs to basically be detached from the rest of your body in order to avoid all of it. While the game is, in theory, short (You can beat it within 30-40 minutes, easily), the problem will be surviving that long. While the difficulty curve is high, you'll feel much satisfaction flying through the air, gunning down turrets and bots while evading all the shots coming your way.\n\nThe game is merciless, but it'll throw you a few things to help you out: You can find random badges to boost your stats, various items that you can use, and gun mods that change how your gun preforms.\n\nIn addition, you can make your guns level up, making them stronger. However, this leveling system only rewards skillful play, as you'll lose levels in your guns as you take damage (Like in Cave Story or, to a lesser extent, Godhand).\n\nAs if everything else wasn't randomized enough, you even get randomized story lines (as long as you have the silly text option turned on)! The writing is pretty well done, and may get a few laughs out of you! Granted, you should only be reading when you're not currently being shot at.\n\nThe level design is nothing short of outstanding. There's a pretty wide variety of rooms you can run into, and when you think you've seen all of them, the game will suddenly throw something new in your face. Even when the game reuses rooms, the enemy layout and types will change, keeping you on your toes. There's also plenty of secrets to find! These secrets can hold badges, experience/money, or even spare weapons, allowing you to carry two weapons instead of just one! This game rewards exploration, and you'll find plenty of well-hidden secrets, and tricky jumping puzzles to reach some of them.\n\nFor those worried about performance, there's a wide variety of graphical options for you to change. If you have a lower end PC, I do recommend lowering some, as some rooms have massive amounts of enemies, and can cause frame rate issues if your machine can't handle it.\n\nI can't think of any real valid complaints with Tower of Guns. All the issues I do have seem trivial, and don't seem to affect the gameplay in the slightest. If you like old-school FPS action, and want to make it a bit more high-risk, Tower of Guns is for you.","March 15, 2014","true","53.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

If you wish, you can enable to "silly story" mode that gives you a randomized story each time you play the game, but that's just left to dialogue at the start of a level and sometimes at the end. Story is put on the backseat for the gameplay, so the gameplay must be good, right?\n\nWell, I would say the gameplay is polished, but not good. If you played something like an arena shooter or touhou before, you'll do fine. Only a few enemies actually move, and the rest just stand still and shoot at you, which makes it easy to destroy them. The "challenge" comes from an overspawn of enemies, sometimes right on top of you when you enter a new room (literally, they appear right on top of you, this is not an exaggeration). Well, that's one of the games selling points. Jump around, roll around at the speed of sound, and shoot stuff. So the game is polished, you shouldn't have FPS issues, but the problem is. It's boring. The guns themselves don't really offer much of a difference in a "kick". They are feel the same when you fire them, there is no "weight" shown to the guns, no real recoil. The only difference between a gun is how fast it shoots, how big the bullet is, and how much damage it does. When you realize that, then its just plain smarter to pick up one of the "rocket" guns, pick the perk that makes you immune to self-damage, and jump-n-shoot.\n\nLevels are short. Very short. Before you enter each new level, you're given a PAR time, which can go from two minutes to five minutes, and you don't need to kill all the enemies you see. You could jump-n-shoot from door to door until you get to the boss of the level, kill it, and move on. The levels also lack variation. If you've been to the "Warehouse" level at least three times, then you've seen everything the Warehouse will ever offer you. You'll be able to move through it like it was nothing, you'll be able to know where the power-ups are probably hiding, you can take a detour to the secret rooms, then head for the doors.\n\nPerks seem to have minor differences that don't make much of a difference in the long-run. The starting perk lets you have three jumps, but you can aquire items that give you three jumps anyway. Some perks increase armor or speed, but again, you can just find items. Speaking of items, they are very ehh. You got stat items, and usable items. Stat items are just increases or decreases in things like HP, difficulty, armor, etc. As for the usable items, well, this will make me sound dumb, but I wasn't sure what some of them did. One item I used kept me from moving for a bit, and I decided to not use that anymore, another item regenerated my HP as long as I was standing in a green pool, and another gave me a pea-shooter (PEW PEW) that could be fired along with my normal gun. The usable items are also given dumb, "silly" names that just... why? Really, why? If I pick up a usable, I want to know, from the start, what it does, and only like three items gave me a clue of what they did.\n\nBut it can be a decent time waster if you only got an hour or two to play a game. Don't buy it at the full price, however. Wait for a sale or for it to go on a humble bundle again.","November 18, 2014","true","4.9"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

I only have 2 hours on this game so far, but I highly recommend it.\nThanks Humble Bundle.\n\nIt's a rogue-like FPS bullet hell with randomly generated rooms and random bosses. ~8 upgradable weapons, 2 unlocked by default. About 10 perks(2 default). An endless mode and some other things I haven't checked out. The art style reminds me a bit of Borderlands. Interesting secrets to be found, illusory walls, high places, tight places, etc.. I think I reached a cap of having 9 jumps(8 extra in mid-air), which is fun and still not overpowered. It has controller support. The weapons are just upgraded automatically when you collect enough XP during a run, and it loses XP as you take damage, so your weapon can delevel if you suck it up. Each stage is timed, with a par time, though you can finish as slow as you want. You can collect money to spend on things you find. You can find many extra items that work as temporary increased crit chance, a weapon, etc.. Some pickups increase and decrease difficulty, add armor, damage... Modifications to the weapon can drop from enemies too. Blah blah blah. Just try it already!","October 29, 2014","true","4.4"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

This game is a must play for fans of roguelike action games and first person shooters. Especially old school shooters, it just has that classic feel to it. I haven't had so much fun with a shooter since the golden days of DOOM, Duke Nukem 3D, Quake and the like. The graphics are good, the music is amazing, and the gameplay is frantic.

Without a speed up, theres a good chance itll curve around and flank you, therefore you must cause it to collide with an enemy or the terrain. With the speed up you can outrun it if you stay mobile.\n-The gun mods give each weapon great replayability. While you might not like the slow firing but powerful crossbow, the rapid fire or spreadshot mods could change the weapon to fit your playstyle.\n- Pickup Items are very varied and show up often enough that you're bound to find one you like on each playthrough.\n- This game has A really high replayability value. Once you beat the game, get all the guns, and get the perks you can activate endless mode to fight increasingly difficult floors. If you get tired of that, then activate RTD mode, where each floor has a different modifier that could help or hurt you. There could even be a secret boss if you look hard enough.\n- The weapon selection you get covers every time of gun from machine gun to shotgun. But there are also guns you can get randomly throughout playing. My favorite gun really motivates me.\n-Level design really makes use of the momemtum of the game, and the same room layout doesn't always have the same secrets( with the exception of one filled with love).  this gives an added feeling of satisfaction when exploring a room.\n- the music and the artsyle of this game really compliment each other very well.\nCons:\n-While I do enjoy the feel of the guns they are energy weapons. therefore instead of a BANG the shotgun makes a mixture of a puff and air and a BZZT. This is a pretty nitpicky con and only applies to a personal level, but I prefer the sound of bullets and shells over engery cells.\n\nI wholeheartedly recommend this game.\n","July 18, 2014","true","27.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Let me explain. First off, this is a FPS roguelike with a fairly 'sterile' environment. You seem to be the only human in the whole game; it is just you versus a giant tower of turrets (or guns). The graphics are slightly reminiscent of Borderlands, and the music is decent. Apprently the game was created by two brothers, which is cool (I love anything indie). I also mention that because I would have a fairly different opinion if this was a big-budget game, which I do not believe it was.\n\nPros:\n1. Because the difficulty is not *really* that steep, this is a fairly addictive, fun, brainless shooter. It is fun to unlock things ala BoI style.  This factor is done well enough alone, to win my thumbs up.\n\nCons:\n1. Storyline is tedious to read, and because of that, I cannot really comment on it. They should have done the storyline differently. The text is far too small to read from the couch when playing on a bigscreen. Plus the storyline generally occurs at the begining of a level when I am ready to run-and-gun.\n2. All the guns feel the same, overall. They need to have more punch behind them.\n3. Secret rooms are not intuitive to find, it seems like just luck that gets me to find the false walls.\n4. Your gun levels up to max level 5, which seems like a short cap.\n5. The unmodded jump is entirely to short (height-wise).\n\nBottom line: Get it on sale, and have a fun weekend.\n","December 16, 2014","true","2.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","2","4","0","0"

There is some small variation in level order, with each level made up of a series of several distinct rooms or 'chambers', which are again randomly selected from a pool. However, many of these rooms are similar and it will not take you long to become familiar with all of them.\n\n2) The game must be relatively short\n\nI've reached the 5th level so far and, although this may be close to the end for all I know, it is still too far in to feel entirely happy about starting again from the beginning.\n\n3) The difficulty must be reasonable and consistent throughout.\n\nNow here is where the game utterly FAILS. For most of any particular playthrough of TOG, the difficulty is ridiculously easy. All you have to do is make sure you keep moving while keeping your finger on the fire button. Most of the 'enemies' in the game are in fact static turrets, that fire a bazillion intimidating-looking missiles in your direction, but at an unfeasably slow pace and with no sense of movement anticipation. Once you have the targets in your sights it is actually a pretty dull experience.\n\nHowever, due to to a certain portion of the enemies (turrets) spawning in random positions, there is often a moment of frenetic insanity when you first enter a room where you are bombarded from what seems like all directions. In most cases it just takes a split second to figure out where the barrages are coming from, find something to hide behind or which direction to move in to dodge the bullets, and it's a dull cakewalk again. But in that split second, if you find your view blocked by the ostensibly quaint, but actually quite obnoxious and distracting 2D smoke and explosion effects, and happen to run in the wrong direction, you are liable to recieve a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of damage all in the one moment and DIE. And start again. From the beginning. When it really isn't even your fault.\n\nThe game has some quirky humour, plenty of easter eggs to find and a generally appealing steampunk-esque look and feel. But there is no point in this game where you feel your reflexes and cunning have helped you survive. Rather, it alternates between dumb luck when you enter a room and routine clean-up operations once you know where the guns are.\n\nI'd give it about 2-3 hours of gameplay before the novelty gives way to irritation, so not a very good deal.","April 4, 2014","false","2.8"," 24 of 49 people (49%) found this review helpful","49","24","49","0","1"

It has well under an hour's worth of content but because of the difficulty for the first time, permadeath, and learning which items and guns are worth using, it extends the gameplay. I do not care for permadeath games because I do not want my game to be artificially extended because the developers programmed the game to screw me over at some point to falsely extend the game time and force me to play more than I want/need to, but this game gives you complete control over when, where, and how you die. The graphics are cell shaded like Borderlands, which means that you should be able to run it at max because cell shaded graphics are not demanding at all, and neither are indie games. The enemy towers are varied and so are the weapons and items, but some weapons are garbage and some items do nothing. Why have "a pair of goggles" in the game that when activated says "the goggles do nothing!" Why even ♥♥♥♥ing put something like that in a game? The music is a huge tease too. One track starts out sounding exactly like the music from Terminator 2, and another from the slasher movie that all you young kids on steam that are reading this should watch, Halloween, but it ends up just sounding god awful. The sound effects are decent though.\n\nI beat it in a little over 4 hours, on like my 11th try or so, and it unlocked nightmare. I got this in a bundle for $1 that I bought for something else and this was a pleasant surprise but I have zero desire to ever play it again. One playthrough is enough for this game, and I only recommend buying it cheap.","November 8, 2014","true","4.2"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

Despite my personal misgivings about the various videos I've seen of this game, I thought I'd give it a try due to the amount of positive reviews it has. I understand this was only made by two people, but to me that isn't a good enough excuse for making such a lazy, uncreative game. Many solo projects have been amazing (Braid, Dust, etc.). The comparisons made to Binding of Isaac and Doom are utterly ridiculous. I haven't played much of Isaac, but it has that undeniable style of Team Meat and a recognisable personality. Doom had incredibly satisfying weapons and varied enemies with cool death animations, as well as a haunting atmosphere (at least for the time). This game has none of that. The guns are ♥♥♥♥-poor in terms of 'feel' and lack that punch which can make or break an FPS. Sound design goes a long way in this regard, which this game is also terrible at. The gun sounds are muted and flaccid, and the music goes horrible crackly and distorted at certain times. When enemies die, they all explode in the exact same fashion, regardless of their size, in a shower of stock UDK particle effects and sounds. There is no personality in the game either. The textures are all a horrible poor-man's Borderlandsy style and the 'humour' in the game just falls incredibly flat (HUGBOTS??? LOL LOL THE CAKE IS A LIE). I cannot for the life of me figure out how this got so many positive reviews - perhaps people simply feel the need to support small indie teams? The only other reason I can think of is that the reviewers had been chained in a dark basement for 20 years and this was their first stimulus after emerging.","February 1","false","0.2"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","44","4","9","0","0"

The gameplay feels so much like Quake II when I'm running around dodging and firing. The levels are somewhat randomized, and there are secrets all over the place.\nI, like many other people I know, used to play Quake and Doom over and over again on quick little binges, but the games did get old after a while. Bumping up the difficulty only does so much when the game is exactly the same each time. ToG gives me this same, "sit down for 20 minutes" experience while keeping the challenge high. Each play through, you pick your weapon and a perk to tweak your run.\nIn general, the pace of ToG is as frantic as you want it to be. You can try to slow down and look for secrets and such, or you can blast through and try to get under the par time for the level.\nSome things to be aware of: There is no saving. You have to play to a death or win in one sitting. Also, you have only one gun, unless you happen to pick up an extra gun during your run. This means you're not worrying about ammo or weapon switching. This is a pure run, jump, and fire sort of game.

Every time I play I feel incredibly tiny, while everything flying at me is really big. And that's awesome. The action is really tense - you need to constantly move to dodge EVERYTHING. For the first time since Quake3 I found jumping extremely usefull not only to climb ledges, but to survive. And that's awesome. There are not a lot of variety of rooms, but it is really great at this point. Try it, you'll probably love it, if you liked UT2004 or Quake3.\n\nThe movement and guns feel definitely Quake-ish.","April 25, 2014","true","5.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Amazing concept right?\n\nAs sarcastic as that last sentence sounded, this is actually a pretty good concept and a well executed one! Tower of Guns is a game where you play an unnamed male character (judging from grunts and what not) who enters "The Tower of Guns". It's that over sized tower with all the guns on it y'know it totally isn't the pinnacle of the entire game or anything.\n\nANYWAY this unnamed male character enters the Tower and fights through 5 randomly generated stages to complete one of the random storylines designated to you, unless you turned the silly stories off you sad sad person. Entering the tower you get the decision between a weapon you've unlocked and a perk, the starting weapons and perks are effective so don't be shunned by the unlock system!\n\nGameplay wise ToG (Tower of Guns) plays out like a typical quake shooter, you move fast, you shoot a gun at mounted guns or mobile guns depending on your luck on enemy spawns (Dang twerp bots...) and you progress through the levels, levelling your gun up, defeated bosses and collecting power ups and possibly more guns and secrets...if you look hard enough.\n\nOverall the concept of Tower of Guns is relatively simple and despite the hard to imagine concept is performed successfully. This game is a game you can burn a large multitude of hours on and enjoy it for even more to come. A very nice piece of art from Joe Mirabello, his brothers musical pieces amazing as well!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thetitaniumdragon/recommended/266110/","thetitaniumdragon","TheTitaniumDragon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thetitaniumdragon/","776 products in account","Tower of Guns is a roguelike FPS. You spawn in the first of five levels in the titular Tower of Guns, and must fight your way through it until you reach the top – and victory. Along the way, you will fight numerous automated gun turrets – both fixed and floating – along with various other mechanical enemies which will attack you in hopes of killing you and forcing you to start over. Every level ends with a boss fight in some sort of arena, with a variety of bosses (and indeed, of possible levels) trying to keep things fresh.\n\nThat being said, this game is not actually that diverse in terms of gameplay. You only play through five levels (or six, if you go on to fight the optional final boss) in any particular playthrough. The levels are quite short, and can be beaten in just a few minutes, though you might spend 10+ minutes trying to find all the secrets in them (to no success; this is nearly impossible to do). You upgrade yourself by finding various random pickups, as well as collecting coins and using them on random vending machines which contain said pickups. Rarely, you will find a new gun. Enemies drop health (for healing) as well as xp (for levelling up your gun to shoot better shots and deal more damage).\n\nBut while all of this is well and good, and you can start the game with your choice of a weapon and a powerup (and unlock more of these by doing various tasks in-game), the sad reality is that there just isn’t that much to this game. The enemies end up being very samey after a while, and the room layouts become very familiar. The secrets are kind of obnoxious to find – some of them can only be found if you have the right items/pickups, which are random, while others are actually hidden behind invisible walls which give no hint to their existence. As the secrets are the primary gameplay extender here, and they’re kind of lame in many cases, this kind of hurts the game’s replayability even more than it already was, and a lot of the time you spend in-game is spent hunting for the secrets rather than fighting. If you just fight your way through the levels, most can be beaten quite easily within five minutes, and indeed, there are unlocks for doing so.\n\nThe game isn’t very difficult either; after my first three playthroughs ended at the first boss, I nearly beat the game on my next two playthroughs, and then successfully did so on my sixth, only four hours into the game, at which point the game held little new for me. Sure, there were various secrets that I hadn’t found, but what’s the point in hunting those out when so many of them are arbitrary? Moreover, what’s the point when you have already beaten the game – what challenge is there left for you? Is endless mode really that much of an attraction?\n\nThe answer to all this is “not so much”, meaning that this is more or less a game that you’ll play for an afternoon, beat, and unless you’re a hyper completionist, never bother with again. While the alternate text at the start of every level giving a bit of randomized backstory to why you are in the tower is mildly clever, it was simply not amusing enough to make me want to keep playing the game over and over again until I saw them all.\n\nThe game isn’t bad, and running through it until you beat it is decent enough, but it is very lightweight and doesn’t really have a whole lot to really recommend it. It is adequate, but is mere adequacy what you really want?\n","December 11, 2015","false","9.6"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

This game isn't bad, and you may still want to pick it up on sale, give it a shot. I have enjoyed it, but I am a bit disappointed as well. I think I'll break this out every once in a while, but it's not a game I'll be playing a lot and I think it could've been a lot better. So here's the good and the bad.\n\nI'll go in depth below, but here's the short version:  Good concept, fun "plots", pleasant graphics, early gameplay is fun. Bad variety, slow pace, small annoyances.\n\nGood:\n- Great concept. Combining a FPS and a rogue-like format has a lot of potential.\n- A randomly selected plot to go with the other rogue-like features is fun.\n- The graphics are nice and fun. There's also pretty good contrast so I don't feel like I get hit by things I can't see.\n- Gameplay overall is pretty fun, especially the first handful of runs.\n\nBad:\n- Though it does have rogue-like elements, there isn't much variation. The stages consist of strung together rooms, and the rooms are randomly chosen, but not randomly generated. You start with a gun, which you get to choose from a list, but it's very rare to find another gun along the way. As of writing this, I've played for 3.5 hours and I have never actually run across a second gun while playing (although apparently you can find one). Most of the power-ups are pretty generic (extra jumps, health, speed, damage etc.) The items have decent variety, but you can't use them very often. Several of them are mostly useful for finding secret areas, and a few are pretty much useless. The weapon mods are also pretty varied, but all in all, it felt like the only big variation in my runs was the gun I chose at the beginning.\n\n- The game feels slow. The character moves at a decent speed, so that's not the problem. But a lot of the power-ups are in hidden "secret" areas. They take time to find, and if you don't search for these, you'll find yourself behind later. You also have to check each power-up before you take it; some of them have negative effects. Additionally, instead of lots of small rooms, stages are a handful of very large rooms typically, so it feels slower paced because you spend a lot of time in one place. Consequentially, you also spend a lot of time trying to snipe enemies from far away, and most of the guns aren't accurate so that takes time too. And there are other small things, like the doors taking time to open, bullets moving slowly - it just feels slow paced.\n\n- Small things: Collision detection can be spotty occasionally. Last bosses are supposed to be hard, but this one feels unproportionally hard. Or maybe the levels are a bit too easy. The small flying enemies tend to get pretty annoying. Overall the game is a bit short.","November 1, 2014","false","4.1"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","3","9","0","0"

It combines the worst of monotonous cel-shaded tile pasting and monochromatic brown EVERYTHING. Every enemy is the same color, and almost every level is the same color, except for one I saw with red pillars and another that had some blue cubes. The art design suffers as well - in the 90 minutes I've played so far (approximately 3  non-salaried lunch breaks, so I feel confident enough in my experience to review this game) the most exciting level design I've seen is big rings of spikes. Every time I thought something was cool, it was a big revolving ring of spikes. Enemies suffer from a similar lack of creativity - They're all just guns, and the ones that aren't are either bombs or saw-blades. Things are cool at first because they have more guns on them than they should and it seems Artistic until you see the same thing over and over again. The levels are ugly as sin and sometimes they're just plain too dark.\n\nThe sound design and mixing is bad.\n\nThe story is 'randomly generated', which seems cool but its implementation is marred by a similar lack of creativity. Your 'tutorial playthrough' will last for three or four lives, and then you will start getting story out of nowhere. None of them are interesting or add to the game in any way. One was a spoiled heiress whose father hid a fortune at the top of the tower, and another was a parody of terminator where the tower is the terminator and you have to escape by going through the entire thing. The jokes are pedantic and boring and as another reviewer said, it's so self-referential that that's really all the thematic content there is.\n\nThe mechanics are where the game 'shines', but I use that word in the sense that a kernel of corn is shiny compared to the turd that contains it. Running is responsive and quick, jumping is intentionally a little nerfed to give jump powerups more usefulnes, and the guns shoot when you click the button, which is nice. That's about as good as it gets. The guns you use go from pea-shooter to fairrly overpowered but still not fun to use. There aren't a lot to unlock, either. So far I've got a gun that shoots saw blades, a gun that shoots 'bullets,' a 'shotgun,' and I just got a 'cannon.' Really, it's not as creative as you might think. Just because your gun shoots balls of light instead of bullets doesn't mean it's not the same kind of shotgun we've all seen before, just with bad sound effects and little responsiveness or satisfaction of use. They also max out at level 5, which seems premature and can be easily accomplished well before the final level.\n\nThe gameplay itself is mediocre. Either you will breeze through a level without really having a hard time or it will absolutely demolish you with no chance of success, and there is very little middle ground to be found between these two extremes. It's exacerbated by incredibly ridiculous environmental traps (one level has an entire floor made of sinking tiles above lava and you need to be jumping constantly to survive. Unless you have the perk that makes you invincible to lava, which brings me to my next point: the game allows you to buff yourself like crazy. There are perks that allow you to negate damage from falling, negate damage from all spikes and lava, jump like crazy, you name it. Fighting a boss whose only weapon is spikes three times in one run while using a perk that makes you immune to spikes takes a lot of fun out of the game. The fact that it's randomly generated means you can't really anticipate something like this in advance.\n\nLevels are designed so badly that there are big bright arrows on the walls pointing you to the exit, and many times you will have to fight an impossible number of turrets while positioned on a tiny catwalk. Trying to dodge projectiles, shoot, and not fall is just not very enjoyable. Don't get me wrong, I LOVE hard games. Dark Souls, Risk of Rain, the NES Ninja Gaiden series - games like these turned 'impossible' into an art form, and they're fun because they punish you in the right ways and reward you for succeeding. Another major complaint of mine is that you can exit the level as soon as you find the door, and enemies will sometimes continue to spawn as long as you stay in the room. This means that occasionally you can never really feel like you've finished a level, and makes the player wonder whether they should focus on fighting enemies or just speed-running through the whole game.\n\nBosses are awful. Some will assault you from so many different angles that even if you're invincible to the damage it's still not fun. True creativity also seems to be anathema to this title, because the bosses are all incredibly bland. There's a room of spikes with a vulnerable spot to shoot, and you may see it more than once in a single run. There's a flying ball of spikes and guns that turns into lava, there's a flying ball of spikes and guns that just shoots you, and there's a ball that's literally nothing but guns. The idea that there are lots of guns shooting at you is kinda cool, but it can't carry an entire game's concept by itself.\n\nAnd the game really does not reward you for succeeding. There are only a handful of guns and content seems lacking in general. There are so many ways around the various challenges in the game that it's not really fun until you come to an impossibly difficult challenge and then it stays not fun. Buying items from stores can be frustrating as it takes your money based solely on proximity, and the pickups sit on a pedestal that can be a little frustrating to get to in the heat of the moment, which is more frustrating than it should ever be. The game keeps track of your deaths at every game over screen and logs your death-to-win ratio, which is not something I've ever seen before in a game. I guess kills-to-losses just doesn't have the same ring to it?\n\ntl;dr: I feel like I'm alpha testing a game that holds little promise of not being ♥♥♥♥♥♥ even when it's finished. There's nothing here that many other games haven't done better, and the things that seem "new" are marred by a lack of creativity and poor execution. It misses all the points it tries to hit, and playing it is more like a chore than a 'lunch break.'\n\n4/10.","February 25, 2015","false","1.5"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

Perhaps other than that this is the sort of game that really required a much larger budget. The idea of "a roguelike FPS" sure sounds fun, and it certainly delivered on its promise.\n\nUnfortunately, it delivered barely more than the minimum. In fact, I'd even call it a prototype or a proof-of-concept. Or even a mod of borderlands, for that matter.\nDon't get me wrong: this is a game with a lot of potential. Unfortunately, it has flaws that really prevent me from getting into the game:\n\n-the weapons don't feel interesting. As mentioned in another review, they're just pee-shooters of varying kind. All the mechanics to change it (items, modifyers, power-up/power-downs) have barely any impact. no secondary fire and infinite ammo also bland things out a lot.\n-the same for the movement mechanics. Things feel very floaty, even if you're not stacking up the double jumps. Add to that that the levels are pretty open...it kind of reminds me of how UT2004 custom levels had to be wider in scale to compensate for all the dodge and wall-tricks you could do. Here, you can't even duck...\n-it's not an FPS. While there are some moving enemies, the game is actually a roguelike bullet hell shooter, that just happens to be in first person perspective.\n-uninteresting level design. I'm not much of a mapper, but the creators certainly went with a quantity over quality approach. Hardly any room feels more than barebone, and aside from the title, I don't feel like climbing a tower to begin with.\n-the story...that huge tower overlooking the city on the front screen is nice, but that's all that is to it. The pieces of conversation at the start of each level feel just as randomized as the actual level. And while FPS'es and roguelikes aren't known for their story-telling aspect, the tone doesn't fit the minimalistic level design.\n-full randomization when it comes to things like stores and items. The bosses are about the only thing consistent, and even that's just the amount of doors you have to pass. The bosses themselves range from easy-peasy to insane, and each such encounter can happen everytime. Result: you just need to be lucky.\n-sounds and music are just boring as hell. And that's worth mentioning because I rarely if ever care for those at all.\n\n\nAll in all...lots of potential, but it delivers too little. I honestly hope this concept gets picked up by a larger studio (or this gets a sequel from the original guys). But as it stands...sorry. I love the effort, but the execution just isn't there...","March 29, 2015","false","1.5"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

Literally, you stand there and wait for your bullets to reach the stationary enemy. Level design and music is unique, yet repetitive. Enemies are not very fun to fight, except for maybe the bosses. Graphics are somewhat poor for a game in 2014, but what can I say, it's basically a mod.

But it just isn't worth the money. There are just so many things lacking.\n\nFor example, there is no sprint button. And you can have one, and only one, weapon per run - and they are not exactly the most exciting wepons to have been seen in a video game.\n\nAlso, every stage has a par time that you could try to beat. Except that there is no timer during play, so you have no idea how long you have left. Hey, did I mention that there is no sprint button?\n\nBut the worst thing is that all difficulty in the game comes from just throwing out heaps and heaps of enemies and bullets at you, there is no AI to outsmart or anything, just gazillions of small flying enemies that shoot at you and who are difficult to hit since your own bullets are just as slow as the enemy bullets - which means that I'm pretty sure it is actually possible to run into your own bullets, with some of the slower weapons and with a speed-up powerup.\n\nIt's not a horrible game, it just feels kind of cheap. If you get it really cheap in a humble bundle or something, give it a shot and see what you think.

At 15 dollars its a rip off as it only takes like 45 min to beat the whole game. You can play but the levels are basically the same, with the exact same bosses, and number, but with a few of the enemies of the pool of like 10 switched out for others. People love to replay games that are random gen but it's usually not a substantial difference, such as is the case here, but people tell themselves they are playing something completely different. There are some interesting guns, and they can increase the replay value, but the delivery system is flawed. You only get them from obtuse and sometimes impossible challenges like "find 5 secrets in a level" (looking all over a level I only found 20%), and "beat entire level without taking damage" or "kill 250 of this enemy", so either you can't do them or you need to replay the game so much with the same guns to finally unlock 1 more. Same for perks. The whole idea is to unlock something each time to make you want to retry with something new, not have top take 7 retrys with the same guns to get one more. Also the game doesn't explain the upgrades you get or items you get when you see them, as well as the red orbs, which didn't really seem like they healed you much. It is lame you can only upgrade your gun to level 5 as that happens relatively quickly and then blue orbs mean nothing to you. Would have been interesting to see actually visible and different upgrades to the gun, instead of the same looking shot that does a little more damage......they missed the boat there. So while the shooting is fun and the idea and levels are interesting, theres just not enough here, and some missed opportunities in the mechanics and overall game design. 6/10.","April 9, 2015","false","3.7"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","2","8","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ksempac/recommended/266110/","ksempac","Ksempac","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ksempac/","303 products in account","Any fan of the original DOOM should try this game. Others people who like bullet dodging or FPS should also try it.\n\nYou're alone, in a tower made of levels, with each level comprising a few rooms taken randomly from a pool of potential rooms. Meaning no run is the same, but you can apply your knowledge of a room if you've previously been in it. Be careful though, because ennemies spawns are completely random, even if you go into the same room several times.\n\nSo why I'm refering DOOM that wasn't a randomly-generated game ? Because many things remind me of this game (which i love). You have a big weapon, with no scope, no second-fire mode, or any other "modern" gameplay system. That weapon just has a lot of bullets (actually, infinite), which is good because you've got a lot of enemies facing you. So like in the old style FPS, you will have to dance around hords of baddies, kill them one by one and emerge victorious.\n\nAnother big DOOM influence is the secrets. I will not spoil how to find them, but do know that most rooms hide one or more secret areas with power-ups and coins. It's a big joy to try to hunt them all, and finally get that sweet "100% secrets" at the end of the level. If you enjoy this hunt, you will be able to spend a lot of time on it, since the rooms will not be the same everytime. It also often happens that, in a room that you thought you knew perfectly well, you may stumble upon yet another secret you didn't notice before.\n\nThere are many things that i like in ToG. It's hard to describe, because it so unique, made of small things that make a great whole :\nIt's an original idea that has been well executed...\nIt's fun to dodge the slow, but numerous bullets...\nIt's rewarding you with nice explosions full of loots for each ennemie killed....\nIt has a great sense of humor and wacky stories...stories with an s, because a new story is picked randomly with each run !\n\nEach level has a nice distinctive feel that is greatly enhanced by the awesome sound ambience (both the soundtracks, and the ambient sounds). That makes it hard for me to decide which level i like the most, since they all feel unique and great in their own way.\n\nBe careful though, at the beginning the game is a bit rough. You only have 2 possible weapons, and none of them is very good. At first this almost made me throw away the game. But once you've unlocked different games, you will be able to pick the one(s) that most suit your playstyle, and the game will be more enjoyable. Contrary to many others games that fall down, I like this game more after 10 hours of play than after the first one.\n\nI'm not sure how deep the game is. I've beaten it in the most simple way, but they are many additional challenges that you can set yourself to (endless mode, difficulty modifiers, and others things which i won't spoil, ...). I'm not able to complete theses challenges yet, so i'm trying, getting better each time (and finding more secrets !). So, for now, after 11h in the game, I'm really enjoying it and want more of it.\n\nBIG THUMBS UP for this game :)","January 4, 2015","true","19.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ghazghul/recommended/266110/","ghazghul","Ghazghul","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ghazghul/","119 products in account","Tower of Guns is a perfect game for a quick injection of FPS action without gore or plot.  The enemies are robotic and bloodless and the story can even be turned off in the launch screen.  You can complete the game in a lunchtime but be warned that succeeding with every weapon / perk combo can become addictive.  Endless mode is exactly that and with some luck can result in 2-3hr+ runs.\n\nI grew up with Quake, QuakeWorld and Unreal Tournament.  The controls feel closest to UT which is not surprising as the engine is Unreal based.  The graphics are a UT / Borderlands hybrid and feel solid whilst providing a good seperation between enemies and backgrounds.  My modest PC didn't sffer slowdown even at later stages which are loaded with enemies and projectiles.  The weapons are varied and challenging to master and whilst feeling underpowerewd initially develop with levels and gun mods.\n\nMy only complaint is that a long run can end suddenly, even with full XP and health, upon meeting an especially packed room or incredibly powerfully enemy.  Often a health bar can be demolished before you have had a chance to react.  This can feel unfair, especially a long way into a run but is soon forgotten as you can be straight back in the action.","February 1, 2015","true","40.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Tower of guns is a fantastic fast paced shooter, and is a serious test of reflexes. The sheer number of enemies trying to shoot at you at once can very quickly become overwhelming if you fail to react. The levels are, while mostly indoors, incredibly spacious and provide a good area to explore (as well as containing a massive amount of hidden rooms, mazes, and in some cases whole levels!)\n\nMy one criticism for ToG is a lack of content. While trying to find 100% of the secrets will keep you searching forever, the number of gouns your character can start with is somewhat limited. It should be noted that you are intended to find more guns as the game progresses, however these are very rare and most of the time you will have to complete the game with the gun you start with (although by that point it will be heavily upgraded from all the pickups.)\n\nWhile it may not last you as long as some other games, I feel ToG is well worth trying for a very enjoyable FPS.","September 3, 2014","true","16.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Although you start the game with a very limited selection of guns and perks, you will quickly unlock most of them so that you don't have to pick the weaker default guns and perks.\n\nThere is also a level up mechanic for guns, you can level up your gun up to level 5 (6 with a specific perk) which increases its damage, rate of fire and slightly changes its visual appearance. However you can also lose those levels by taking damage, which adds an interesting element to the game.\n\nAs with most rougelites you can also pick up items which randomly drop from enemies or you can buy them from stations scattered around the levels. The items can be passive (increase your gun damage, increase your jump height, increase the number of jumps you can do, ...) or active (temporarily increase your rate of fire, crit all the time, build a ramp, temporarily drain life on kill, fly for 10s, ...). Sadly the items aren't all that interesting and most of the active ones aren't even very useful.\n\nProbably the best part of the game is that most levels are very vertical, so you are also a lot of the time moving up and down and picking up items which increase your jump height or the number of jumps you can do in mid-air is the best way to increase your fun playing the game. When you've got the possibility to make 5-6 jumps in mid-air and a vastly increased jump height then the game really comes alive. In fact one of the achievements is to stay in the air for 45s and not touch the ground, so there are some great possibilities for air combat here.\n\nBut it has limited replayability due to the relatively small selection of items, low variety in enemies, short length and a semi-procedural level design which means that you will, after just a few runs, start seeing the same rooms again and again.\n\n7 / 10","October 30, 2014","true","8.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You like guns? You like long walks on the beach with british voiceovers? Then get ready for the ride of your life!\n\nTower of Guns is an indie made game that was recently published earlier this March after a year in being developed. In it, your only objective is to make your way through 15 floors to the top of the tower. Sounds easy? Well it would be, if it wasnt for all the guns trying to mow you over. Each floor is randomized, giving you the element of surprise and wonder as bullets, saw blades plasma, spikes, cannons and a whole lotta other stuff tries to kill you. At the end of each floor, you face down a boss, which is also randomized. Hopefully you dont take death too seriously, because not only will it happen, but you are tallied for it to boot. Its not like death is important or anything, right? :D\n\nThis doesnt mean you are entirely weak. Items and powerups you may find from beaten bosses, enemies, or capsules you cant open without enough money (also beaten from enemies) will offer a variety of upgrades to you or your weapon, which are also randomized. Sometimes you might score a good one, sometimes you wont, and sometimes you wont find any. The more you play, the more you can unlock. Collect all the different gun abilities, achieve perks and guns depending on what you do, level up your gun by collecting the blue orbs and stay alive by collecting the red orbs from fallen enemies, and get to the top of that tower!\n\nTower of Guns is a thrilling rush for its worth. I highly recommend taking it for a spin, because if the whole "Tower of Guns" thing doesnt appeal to you, you really are missing out dear viewer. Just remember to never be a sitting duck and keep your eyes open for anything. Theres a lot of flashing and a lot of bullets coming your way, so be ready for the biggest barrage from all sides coming your way! Also, be creative; You arent given any sort of instructions on "how to play", so if you see something interesting, follow up on it, it might take you to a secret, and there are a lot of secrets on each floor.\n\nSo go buy it. Do it! Do it now!","March 7, 2014","true","9.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a rogue like, randomized levels, enemy spawns, loot, and gets crazy difficult at any moment. But instead of being a top down shooter or a Diablo esque RPG, Tower of Guns is a fully fledged first person shooter, with the game mechanics geared towards the more retro side of things. Basically, It's Serious Sam meets Binding of Isaac. And this lovebaby is one heck of a rockstar.\n\nThe visual presentation is unique and varied, the cel shaded effect is quite nice and makes the incredible amount of things you'll be seeing on screen a lot easier to process. Every enemy is unmistakable in design, even if their textures are a little drab for my taste (request to developers, Fruity Textures Mode plz) The sound is zesty, guns sound intentionally weak at first, but sound awesome the more they level up.\n\nLevel design is linear but not confined or simple. Multiple elevated areas, loads of secrets and various ways to cross chasms. They are even comparable to levels from Portal. Typically there are 3 to 4 rooms then a boss room. It's quite intuitive and allows you to gauge how hard the level will be.\n\nMy only complaint with the game so far is the physics are wonky. Some of the platforming objects just do not work correctly. For example, the cog wheels with the platforms, Sometimes it lets you jump off them, sometimes it doesn't. Some objects like pipes and such end up being phased through a lot, which can make reaching some secret and high up areas impossible if the game doesn't like you that run.\n\nWeapon designs are unique and varied. They all level up to be more powerful, and they all suit different styles of play and preference.\n\nI rate the game so far an 8/10. I've yet to unlock Endless Mode, which is sure to be a treat.","March 7, 2014","true","20.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The semi-random level generation keeps the game fresh yet similar it uses randomly selected premade levels rather than pure random generation. Enemies have been updated and are FAR from static with various types of turrets and flying blades and bumpers constantly pushing you into incoming fire. Combine that with all the details such as the random hilarious storylines and the clean gun mechanics and what we have is a pure synergy of genres that simply keep me coming back to simply find what waits at the top of the tower.\n\nThis is a GREAT Rogue-lite.

Some music is great and fits the mood darn near perfectly (Hugbot Alley) but others just suffice\n/At times, too chaotic. 50 spike balls flicking everywhere can be stressful. But its also a pro in that you need to change your approach, and either get the hell out of dodge and blitz through ignoring enemies (you don't have to kill any to proceed) or take it slow\n\nCons:\n-Some balancing issues? Some items don't feel useful. Others seem unclear in how they will help you.\n-Some repetitive enemies, There is only 1 mobile ground based non-boss enemy (that i have seen)\n-It is unclear if there are any benefits to high difficulty\n\nOverall? So far, 5/5, @ 50% 'total' completion with 5 hours played, I have beaten the game once.\nThe gameplay matters, and this game delivers. Not the best in everything, but serious fun that I haven't had in a shooter in a long time.","March 9, 2014","true","12.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Weapon variety.\n\nPassive icons do a good job of letting you know what they do. Items you have to activate you can hold 1 at a time and when you hold 1 and pick up another, the old one falls onto the floor and can be picked up again and the new one has a full charge, so you can try the new one and if you don't like it, you can switch back to the old one. Making the game much more forgiving towards people that don't know what all the items do.  It also allows you to choose your favorite weapon and perk off at the beginning so it feels like you have a little more control of your character then other rogue likes.\n\nThe game is quite good looking for an indie game, looks fairly modern, pleasing to the eye imo. Also, the options menu provides a decent array of options, maybe a little lacking in mouse sensitivity settings. Although the options menu cant be accessed in the middle of a game and you can only move the option in 1 direction, so if you want to go backwards you have to move in a circle.\n\nThe Bad:\nSomething like 20 deaths and i've beaten level 5 boss twice. (final boss unless you play in endless mode). When i played past level 5 in endless mode, the level 6 boss seemed unfair. Giant lava pit that you need to jump across, if you don't have enough jumps, you're dead. It is hard to call the game too easy because there are certainly perks and guns that it would be more difficult to do well in. The problem is there is no incentive i know of to push me to use more difficult settings unlike something like binding of isaac where you had to use the weaker characters to unlock certain things.\n\nYou can only have 1 weapon mod active at a time so you don't see insane combos like you do in other rogue likes. Just 1 weapon mod, then everything else is just a straight up passive health, speed, jump, or damage buff.","March 12, 2014","true","22.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The gun upgrades are perfect, you collect cards that auto-update your guns with bonuses and different attack patterns (Kind of remind me of weapon ungrade in old school games like Contra on the Nes but with a fresh twist)  you can also find other boost like life, speed, jump (You can multiple jump at some point in the game and it's awesome... just beware of fall damage... or take the special ability to not get damaged by falling at the beginning).\n\nOne of the only trouble I have is with the drops you get from your kill... it's unfair sometime how impossible it is to actually get anything your enemies drop especially when you are near lava in the middle of a big fight or on a tight ledge with grinders that crush you mercilessly if you make one step a little bit on the side. Also there's the bullets that may cause some trouble when you try to get your loot but that's because the maze is made of bullets!\n\nThe story should be narrated since you don't really have time to read anything... and they don't give you enough time to read. Some option to give more time to read dialogues would be nice.\n\nThe boss battles are really well done. You can feel the menace emanating from those deadly contraptions and I have only beaten like 3 or 4 of them so far. Can't wait to see the lease one of them.\n\nThe music is excellent, you need to listen to it for yourself to believe it but it fits perfectly with the game. You can hear some of it in the preview video if you doubt my words.\n\nRight now the price is a bit step for a single fps game (15$) but this one offers a lot so if you've got the money it's worth encouraging this kind of gaming industry.\n\n8/10","April 24, 2014","true","2.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's basically the game i play when i want the ziggurat fix without the thinking. The game has been patched a lot post release. All for the better. It features premade levels connected in a random way, much like ziggurat. You shoot a lot of turrets and slow moving robotic enemies. Music is good. Graphics do the job well, and it has it's own look. I recommend a high framerate for this game, so if you are not getting 60-100fps maybe turn down off ssao or something. It does not make a big impact in this game.\n\nMy major complaint, and it's a big one, is that the weapons level up way too quickly, and you are barely finished the first level when you are maxxed out. This makes the rest of the playthrough feel weirdly pointless. Sure you can still get score and unlocks, which carry across deaths - however a progressive rpg mechanic is needed to keep a single playthrough fresh. This game drops the ball when it comes to that.\n\nIf it had a system that made a single playthrough feel like you where constantly getting more powerful right until you reach the end, then this game would get a 9/10.

A few minor issues with collision detection with some of the features on the walls that can hang you up. The charismatically cartoony artwork, headbobbingly catchy music and general atmosphere make a satisfying game which becomes more engrossing onse you unlock some of the more advanced perks and weaponry. The controls are straightforward and kind of no-frills, with features such as sprinting, crouching and climbing being absent, with many drawing a reasonable comparison to Doom and other classic FPS games. The weapons all have a sort of alien or experimental feel to them more akin to Unreal guns, with somewhat unusual projectile properties. A theme of this game being dodging and weaving in and out of enemy fire as in a bullet-hell sh'mup, most of the projectiles (both yours and enemies') travel fairly slowly compared to a more realistic FPS, while the battle areas are often quite large.\n\nA point could be made that loot and money is somewhat scarce at the outset, and acquiring truly helpful and gamechanging items is somewhat rare.

"Where's my roguelike shooter, "Bob"?  My roguelike racer?  My roguelike rollercoaster sim!"  Maybe a week after I made that joke, this came out (or at least to my attention) and then every genre got rogue-ified.\n\nThis is almost exactly what you think it is: a respectable mashup of a first-person arena shooter, bullet hell, and roguelike.  Pewpew or dakkadakka endless amounts of turrets and robots for hundreds of menial upgrades, which quickly add up to a decent upgrade.  In terms of humor, it doesn't take itself very seriously, which is light-hearted and fun.  Your randomly generated "storylines" reveal that swiftly.  The gameplay and levels themselves show that they are seriously well-crafted however.  Personally, it's one of those games you can pick up for half an hour or so every once in a while and romp through some scrap metal with the gun and perks of your choosing, though if you are more interested in a deeper experience, there are things like endless mode and self-imposed handicaps.  If you're an FPS player this game will feel right at home right away, you just have to acclimate to what kind of items, skills, and guns you like.\n\nAll in all the game feels nice and definitely has love put into it.  The graphics and environments vary a little, and usually it's simple and clean.  It's a bit reminiscent of Borderlands' style (that intentionally scrappy and "junk" look).  It's hard to go into detail about anything else because much of it is preference or spoilery - what kind of upgrades and guns are good for example.  A great on-sale or bundle game (as I got my copy in a humble bundle months back).","June 17, 2015","true","6.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However like many other people i was blown away by what I found in this game.  This game (for those who don't know what twitch fps means) is a very fast FPS in which you are constantly being shot at.  In the normal game mode the objective is to get to the top of the five floor tower and kill a boss at the end of each floor.  There is also and random story (wich is just amusing dialouge) for each play through.  This game is very similar in alot of ways to old-scool shooter like serious sam, doom, unreal tournament, ect.  Even with tons of secret rooms and weird little easter eggs! Not only do you have really fluid controls and smooth animation to match, but every play through really is different.  This keeps the game fresh even though most enimies are very similar to one another.  So if you are looking for a new shooter that really takes you back to the golden days (and at the time of this review is only 5$) then look no further.  If you like old-school FPS games like I do then you will definately get more than 5$ out of this game.\n\nP.S. Thank you for being a cool indie developer that listens to your fans Joe!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MysteryAlex/recommended/266110/","MysteryAlex","I Aten't Dead","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MysteryAlex/","258 products in account","Tower of Guns sells itself as a "Lunch Break" Twitch-FPS Roguelike and manages to nail that very vague defination quite well with a few added additions. For starters absolutely everything is shooting at you and by the end of the game you will be lucky to survive. Plus there are a ton of different items available to match the various room formations that add to the replayability, stacked on your absolutely ridiculous arsenal.\n\nEvery Tower of Guns run goes like this (minus a couple variations that I'll let you find for yourself) you start with one gun - your choice - along with a perk - also your choice. The guns are ridiculous going from an easy pistol with spread shot to a gun that shoots giant explosive bullets. As you progress you can level these guns Cave Story-style (easy to increase, damage decreases the level) by picking up Blue XP tokens which will increase the gun's rate of fire and give it a slight variation come level 3. With a fast enough shooting gun you can literally propell yourself around the room by the rate of fire alone. After that you'll get to enjoy one of the game's randomly generated stories ranging from the game itself greeting you and informing you about the game, being a robot exterminator trying to make the Tower into a theme restraunt, a dog secret agent attempting to rescue the President's Daughter, a sentient blob organic lifeform attempting to escape from the security forces of the Tower Lab, and a guy who says nothing but bro trying to find his bro. That was one of my least expected and most favorite of finds in this game as the story unfolds over several levels and are incredibly silly, suiting the game nicely with enough variety that it's unlikely you'll have the same story twice.\n\nAlong your run you'll find badges that will allow you to increase the number of jumps you can have, your speed, your power, etc. Every level is also marked by a different colorfully named mechanical boss who'll drop a weapon mod or an item - which helps balance out the fact that they're much more rare in the level.The first and last levels are always the same (with the last boss being the same as well) and overall the game's length supplements the fact that you're going to die a lot. And that's sadly where Tower of Guns begins to falter.\n\nTower of Guns was made by a couple people but remains really solid. But it also feels as ramshackle as your robot opponents in the process.  Since Tower of Guns is a twitch FPS game, enemies are always firing at you, during bosses, these enemies will endlessly respawn. Usually faster than it's worth destroying them, which means you're dodging projectiles you can't see and can barely hear over the sound and lovely rock soundtrack. More often or not I die during boss battles (and the last) because I take too much damage from things I can't seem to dodge because they are literally EVERYWHERE. On top of that, those badges that upgrade your abilities are found in secret areas or in shops, and it's not guarenteed that they'll appear during a run - or if they're even useful (I'm looking at you Difficulty up and Mystery Box). Thus a large - practically excessive - amount of luck is placed on top of an already unsteady experience. I'm ten runs in and I have not won once yet. But then again I always go after the uber wins so... your millage may vary.\n\nTower of Guns is a good game with its flaws being what keeps it from being great. But that isn't a bad thing. Because it embraces the fact that it's a short game with each run lasting about a half an hour, even the more annoying things the game exhibits isn't as present as the number of things the game does right. Plus if it's really bothering you, just pick the TooYoungToDie perk, there's really no shame in it.

It's a pure action FPS with roguelike elements. The action is handled well, if not particularly inspiring. The game is well crafted and looks nice for an indie. You can tell that whoever made it was really dedicated to making a good game.\n\nThe roguelike elements aren't handled very well and are one of the major problems. You're normally stuck with the same gun from the beginning, but can get a couple upgrades. Most other loot is just stat boosts. I was never really excited to get any particular drop, and each game felt largely the same. The worst part is that you can only upgrade your main gun a few levels before it caps and picking up XP becomes useless without certain upgrades you probably won't get.\n\nIt seems to have a similar problem that many roguelikes have. I don't want to bother redoing the early levels, but I feel like I have to in order to level up enough to do well later. But the game doesn't have the kind of huge variety that something like Nethack or Binding of Isaac does. So, after only a few plays, those early levels are a bore. Then you finally get to something new only to be killed by a boss you don't have time to figure out. That's fine if I just wasted a few minutes getting to the boss (like in Dark Souls), but now I have to start from the beginning, and the early stages aren't interesting enough.\n\nThe enemies are often boring: flying enemies that move toward you and maybe shoot, and then tons and tons of turrets. The turrets shoot different things, but it quickly gets repetitive. The levels themselves are sometimes interesting, and there are hidden areas. However, there’s really not much to find given how the roguelike stuff works.\n\nIn the end, it's all just too hollow. After five deaths, I just don't feel like playing anymore. If you want an all-action bullet-hell FPS with minor roguelike elements, this is for you. If you want anything more than that, I'd say to skip it.","February 20, 2015","false","9.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And by everyone I mean those thinking that the game is first an FPS, and second a roguelite. ToG is a roguelite that also just happens to be an FPS. You don't have those newfangled mechanics that all the CoDs and Battlefields have. No head sway, no pretty speedy blurring.\n\nSo what makes it a good game? It's a bullet hell/ballet hyper-shooter with permadeath, randomly pieced together dungeon levels and a random spawn of enemies, all picked from a pool of pre-rendered assets. It's hard to describe so think of it this way: Binding of Isaac meets Ziggurat. It's very much in that genre. If you love those games, I'd suggest you stop reading this and buy Tower of Guns.\n\nWhat's under the hood? The FPS aspect is very last generation. It's smooth camera movements and strafing. There is no run button. No crouch button. You get jump and aim and that's it. The formula is simple and it just works.\n\nWhen you start, you get to choose between 2 guns and 2 perks. You unlock more based on different activities. Die ten times and unlock easy mode perk, finish a stage without taking damage and get the Hand Cannon. (It's literally a cannon you hold with your hand.) There are 10 guns and 10 perks and random gun drops during play.\n\nUpgrades are similar to Binding of Isaac. You get permanent stat increases or decreases. They are buyable or they drop. You get random drop rechargeable items. Giant, slow moving death missiles, laser grids, blocks of goo, and even one that turns you into a human turret. Then you get an always on upgrade. Bouncing bullets, exploding bullets and spread shot among others\n\nEach level offered a randomly picked set of rooms with procedurally generated mob placements. The enemies are numerous and ridiculous. There are bullets. Lots and lots of bullets. There are walls of cannons, rotating turrets that shoot heat sinking missiles, sawblade bots, exploding bots, flying tanks and propeller cannon ceilings. There are so many bullets flying at you at any time that you might just actually crap your pants.\n\nThe game really opens up as a ballet of enemy dodging and killing when you start to get jump modifiers. Double- and triple-jumps make the game come into it's own. If you don't get it by now, this isn't a traditional shooter at all. You can potentially jump so much that you stay airborne for 45 seconds. I know this because there is an achievement.\n\nIf you like the design of Isaac with the stackable upgrade system, and the feel of Ziggurat, this game is right for you.\n\nMy only real complaint is that I had too good of a run and unlocked a lot at once. RNG killed a bit of the replay for me, sadly. Also a system similar to Isaac's main weapon upgrade might make this game that much more awesome. You pick a gun and you are stuck with it. It does level up and each level adds some new perk ot it but you don't get to puke fountains pf blood at your enemies like Azazel.\n\nTL:DR; This is a perfect short spurt, coffee-break roguelite for those who like Isaac, Ziggurat and walls of bullet hell.","March 23, 2015","true","22.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jamfrost/recommended/266110/","Jamfrost","Jamfrost Jamiro","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jamfrost/","623 products in account","Tower of Guns is a fast-paced FPS rogue-lite featuring procedural levels; random bosses; a random, silly story per playthrough; a bunch of items and weapons mods to discover; very angry robots; the ability to choose a starting perk; and satisfying movement. *This game also has a well-deserved epilepsy warning. Certain useable items create flashes on the screen upon use. Please be careful and have fun.*\n\nTower of Guns' has variety. In regard to the level design, there are some set pieces like starting rooms, boss rooms, (which boss you encounter is random), and certain paths, but you can expect to see a bunch of different rooms that follow a theme for each stage. All those stages randomize those rooms to keep the game interesting. What also keeps the game from becoming stale are the random enemy spawns ; so even if you come to a similar section, you'll need to change your tactics according to whatever foe the game throws at you next. Useable items with a multitude of different effects are present in ToG; some of them summon movement altering jellies, fire a barrage of rockets, or make your weapon even more powerful for a limited time so long as they're fully charged.\n\nContinuing on the topic of variety, you start off the game with two available weapons and one perk. As you play, you can unlock up to eight more weapons and ten more perks more to choose from (only one weapon and perk per session). You can then further modify your weapon in-game via the various weapon mods that drop that can simply increase fire speed, give your gun spread, or even turn each projectile into an aoe fire mine when they hit a surface (great with a shotgun). You can then modify your character through the plentiful power-ups you find from your defeated enemies or secret rooms. There are plenty of secret rooms waiting to be found, unfortunately a good chunk of them revolve around having plenty of jump power-ups on your character, which is not a guarantee. The power-ups that you can find include how high you jump, how many jumps you have (I've experienced a thirty plus jump), your weapon experience rate, and even the difficulty.\n\nThis game is not easy. It's a fast-paced shooter involving dozens of enemies and even more bullets, spikes, bombs, etc. If you play Endless Mode, you can expect to run into bullet hell scenarios once you're far enough. What's nice though is that you can modify the difficulty by picking up a (RIP--) power-up or a (RIP++) power-up that decrease and increase the difficulty of the enemies respectively. It's a great way for players to manage the difficulty as they see fit because one too many damage and armor power-ups can make you too powerful which is boring. If that's the case, grab a (RIP++) and restore the challenge. And if the game is too tough, there is a Too Young To Die perk that will start off the game with weaker enemies while buffing the player at the same time, just pick up some (RIP++)'s when you're ready to go fast.\n\nTower of Guns lets the player move really, really fast. It's quite the experience to circle-strafe an enemy with a sixtuple jump or smacking the roof of the game world with a forty jump (you can ignore the ground at this point except to recharge jump). Some of the enemies will start to keep up with you as your progress through the game so expect to run around and engage in a most elegant gun ballet on the ground and in the air.\n\nAll of the above help to contribute to the replayability of this game, but the developer also programmed incentives into the game to keep you playing. Each weapon and perk in the game can be starred upon beating the boss. Ten weapons and eleven perks means perfectionists will have something to chew on while they also chase the achievements. The achievements for this game are well done too. Instead of being just milestones, there are some funny and challenging ones available like Start With a Jump which requires staying in the air for forty five seconds.\n\nIn conclusion, Tower of Guns provides a really fun experience and will entertain for awhile since it's designed well for multiple playthroughs.","November 7, 2014","true","8.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Your mission is to climb a tower of guns, fighting lots of things with guns, using your choice of gun.\n\nThis is not a bad thing.  This game thrives on fundamentals - fast strafing, environmental awareness, staying on target, and exploring every corner.  Consequently, despite being a reasonably difficult game (particularly if we take "completion" in the scope of getting stars with every gun and perk), the learning curve is much less than many "rogue lite" type games.  If you understand the basics of arcade style FPS, you will not struggle to learn this game.\n\nYou start each run by choosing a gun and a perk, which is pretty standard fare - but the game distinguishes itself with well designed weapons and perks that alter and enhance gameplay rather than simply having an "optimal" choice.  As you progress, you upgrade your weapon and find randomly placed or dropped badges (passive buffs) and items (similar in style and implementation to the common rogue-lite "use item" or "spacebar item", with infinite uses on a recharge meter), ultimately shaping the run into something different every time.\n\nGraphics are simple but in a cel-shaded style that generally looks good without being complicated; anyone who's played Borderlands series will find the look (if not the style) pretty familiar.  Of special note, the game supports absurdly high FOV settings, which is just a real tip of the hat to anyone using ultrawide or multimonitor setups, and is greatly appreciated!  The music is catchy and matches the game nicely.\n\nSo is it fun?  In a word: yes.  It's a great pick up and play that caters to fans of arcade FPS.  It's not exactly a casual game, but rather one made for gamers who want that "always new" shooter for when they need that fix.  It does a great job at that - if the game description sounds like something you'd like, ToG delivers.","April 23, 2015","true","15.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Weapon variety.\n\nPassive icons do a good job of letting you know what they do. Items you have to activate you can hold 1 at a time and when you hold 1 and pick up another, the old one falls onto the floor and can be picked up again and the new one has a full charge, so you can try the new one and if you don't like it, you can switch back to the old one. Making the game much more forgiving towards people that don't know what all the items do.  It also allows you to choose your favorite weapon and perk off at the beginning so it feels like you have a little more control of your character then other rogue likes.\n\nThe game is quite good looking for an indie game, looks fairly modern, pleasing to the eye imo. Also, the options menu provides a decent array of options, maybe a little lacking in mouse sensitivity settings. Although the options menu cant be accessed in the middle of a game and you can only move the option in 1 direction, so if you want to go backwards you have to move in a circle.\n\nThe Bad:\nSomething like 20 deaths and i've beaten level 5 boss twice. (final boss unless you play in endless mode). When i played past level 5 in endless mode, the level 6 boss seemed unfair. Giant lava pit that you need to jump across, if you don't have enough jumps, you're dead. It is hard to call the game too easy because there are certainly perks and guns that it would be more difficult to do well in. The problem is there is no incentive i know of to push me to use more difficult settings unlike something like binding of isaac where you had to use the weaker characters to unlock certain things.\n\nYou can only have 1 weapon mod active at a time so you don't see insane combos like you do in other rogue likes. Just 1 weapon mod, then everything else is just a straight up passive health, speed, jump, or damage buff.","March 12, 2014","true","22.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You can use the enemies, jump on them to gain ground. Use your own guns to mess with the enemies and get to secret hiding spots. With every weapon, it brings different mechanics to the game.

No real reason to, I just feel like it.\n\n\nTower of Guns is a Room-based RNG FPS, built upon the Unreal Engine and published by Blankslatejoe and his Bad posture games. The game is similar to that of binding of Isaac. You enter a randomly generated room, fight the enemies assigned and move onto the next room, sometimes the enemies might be specials, sometimes they might drop items, sometimes there are pickups like coins and ♥♥♥♥ to buy useful things like stat boosts and upgrades, or use items.\n\nThere are 8 guns in total, which you start with two and unlock the next six via various methods. Clearing the game, dying 8-10 times, getting X thing, ecetera. Along with that, there are roughly 10+ guns you can only obtain as rare drops/bought from the level's coin machine at the chance. These guns range from totally useless to so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ OP it kills bosses in roughly two-three shots.\n\nSpeaking of OP, use items range in the same way. Items you slot as action items can be used to do various things. There are useless ones like the "Thread Derailer" which summons cat pictures with meowing affects; but no damage. Then there are super OP items like the Blue shell, which is a single large rotating sawblade that can wipe even the final boss in a matter of seconds. Only suitable, given the name.\n\nAs you'd expect stat bonuses stack, and they will stack high ranging from Extra jumps, to jump height bonuses, to speed boosts, to strength boosts. There are also items to lower difficulty (Enemies spawn amount & Damage), Raise difficulty (Opposite of lower), and items to boost the XP rate of your weapons and the fill rate of your use item bar.\n\nSince it's just Joe working on the game, updates are slow; but usually helpful. He aims to fix the game where he can, and the game suffers minimal issues as far as I run into. And being built on the unreal engine, you can bet you can jump and strafe around like you're playing UT2004 again if you get the jump and speed bonuses to match. If you enjoy a bullet-hell twist on the usual BoI formula, feel free to get the game. Especially since it's on sale right now during the summer sale; which is when I wrote this.\n\n","June 23, 2014","true","32.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Clearly a lot of love went into making this game, and it shows- The ridiculous stories and unlockables keep replayability up, and the endless mode is something any roguelike/lite needs. With how secret a lot of the secrets are, you'll be finding new things after hours of playing- I found a non-unlockable gun during a recent run, allowing me two weapons to switch between, instead of being stuck with just one as I had been for the entire time before.\nIf you're trying to decide between this and Paranautical Activity, go for this. The graphics aren't headache-inducingly neon and blocky, and the gameplay in general feels so much more polished- which is quite a feat for a one-man team.

But each run didn't feel like a waste of time, it was fun to see all the level designs, and each run I'd find new things.\n\nThe combat is a little simplistic but I found it really satisfying to max out your weapon and kick ♥♥♥. Its really fun to jump around like a madman with 6 extra jumps too.\n\nThe game is just oozing with secrets, and some really cool easter eggs. I won't spoilt them but they are pretty good.\n\nOverall if you want a fresh style to rogue lite games, and don't mind insta- dying from one bad jump despite being op as ♥♥♥♥, then give it a try.

You like guns? You like long walks on the beach with british voiceovers? Then get ready for the ride of your life!\n\nTower of Guns is an indie made game that was recently published earlier this March after a year in being developed. In it, your only objective is to make your way through 15 floors to the top of the tower. Sounds easy? Well it would be, if it wasnt for all the guns trying to mow you over. Each floor is randomized, giving you the element of surprise and wonder as bullets, saw blades plasma, spikes, cannons and a whole lotta other stuff tries to kill you. At the end of each floor, you face down a boss, which is also randomized. Hopefully you dont take death too seriously, because not only will it happen, but you are tallied for it to boot. Its not like death is important or anything, right? :D\n\nThis doesnt mean you are entirely weak. Items and powerups you may find from beaten bosses, enemies, or capsules you cant open without enough money (also beaten from enemies) will offer a variety of upgrades to you or your weapon, which are also randomized. Sometimes you might score a good one, sometimes you wont, and sometimes you wont find any. The more you play, the more you can unlock. Collect all the different gun abilities, achieve perks and guns depending on what you do, level up your gun by collecting the blue orbs and stay alive by collecting the red orbs from fallen enemies, and get to the top of that tower!\n\nTower of Guns is a thrilling rush for its worth. I highly recommend taking it for a spin, because if the whole "Tower of Guns" thing doesnt appeal to you, you really are missing out dear viewer. Just remember to never be a sitting duck and keep your eyes open for anything. Theres a lot of flashing and a lot of bullets coming your way, so be ready for the biggest barrage from all sides coming your way! Also, be creative; You arent given any sort of instructions on "how to play", so if you see something interesting, follow up on it, it might take you to a secret, and there are a lot of secrets on each floor.\n\nSo go buy it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MysteryAlex/recommended/266110/","MysteryAlex","I Aten't Dead","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MysteryAlex/","258 products in account","Tower of Guns sells itself as a "Lunch Break" Twitch-FPS Roguelike and manages to nail that very vague defination quite well with a few added additions. For starters absolutely everything is shooting at you and by the end of the game you will be lucky to survive. Plus there are a ton of different items available to match the various room formations that add to the replayability, stacked on your absolutely ridiculous arsenal.\n\nEvery Tower of Guns run goes like this (minus a couple variations that I'll let you find for yourself) you start with one gun - your choice - along with a perk - also your choice. The guns are ridiculous going from an easy pistol with spread shot to a gun that shoots giant explosive bullets. As you progress you can level these guns Cave Story-style (easy to increase, damage decreases the level) by picking up Blue XP tokens which will increase the gun's rate of fire and give it a slight variation come level 3. With a fast enough shooting gun you can literally propell yourself around the room by the rate of fire alone. After that you'll get to enjoy one of the game's randomly generated stories ranging from the game itself greeting you and informing you about the game, being a robot exterminator trying to make the Tower into a theme restraunt, a dog secret agent attempting to rescue the President's Daughter, a sentient blob organic lifeform attempting to escape from the security forces of the Tower Lab, and a guy who says nothing but bro trying to find his bro. That was one of my least expected and most favorite of finds in this game as the story unfolds over several levels and are incredibly silly, suiting the game nicely with enough variety that it's unlikely you'll have the same story twice.\n\nAlong your run you'll find badges that will allow you to increase the number of jumps you can have, your speed, your power, etc. Every level is also marked by a different colorfully named mechanical boss who'll drop a weapon mod or an item - which helps balance out the fact that they're much more rare in the level.The first and last levels are always the same (with the last boss being the same as well) and overall the game's length supplements the fact that you're going to die a lot. And that's sadly where Tower of Guns begins to falter.\n\nTower of Guns was made by a couple people but remains really solid. But it also feels as ramshackle as your robot opponents in the process.  Since Tower of Guns is a twitch FPS game, enemies are always firing at you, during bosses, these enemies will endlessly respawn. Usually faster than it's worth destroying them, which means you're dodging projectiles you can't see and can barely hear over the sound and lovely rock soundtrack. More often or not I die during boss battles (and the last) because I take too much damage from things I can't seem to dodge because they are literally EVERYWHERE. On top of that, those badges that upgrade your abilities are found in secret areas or in shops, and it's not guarenteed that they'll appear during a run - or if they're even useful (I'm looking at you Difficulty up and Mystery Box). Thus a large - practically excessive - amount of luck is placed on top of an already unsteady experience. I'm ten runs in and I have not won once yet. But then again I always go after the uber wins so... your millage may vary.\n\nTower of Guns is a good game with its flaws being what keeps it from being great. But that isn't a bad thing. Because it embraces the fact that it's a short game with each run lasting about a half an hour, even the more annoying things the game exhibits isn't as present as the number of things the game does right. Plus if it's really bothering you, just pick the TooYoungToDie perk, there's really no shame in it. I just don't take it because I always seem to come THIS CLOSE to winning every run only to die because I didn't get enough jumps or damage during the run, or I jump into something I didn't see. With that Tower of Guns gets a recommendation with the hopes that the next game these guys make will be even better.","February 20, 2015","true","12.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a pure action FPS with roguelike elements. The action is handled well, if not particularly inspiring. The game is well crafted and looks nice for an indie. You can tell that whoever made it was really dedicated to making a good game.\n\nThe roguelike elements aren't handled very well and are one of the major problems. You're normally stuck with the same gun from the beginning, but can get a couple upgrades. Most other loot is just stat boosts. I was never really excited to get any particular drop, and each game felt largely the same. The worst part is that you can only upgrade your main gun a few levels before it caps and picking up XP becomes useless without certain upgrades you probably won't get.\n\nIt seems to have a similar problem that many roguelikes have. I don't want to bother redoing the early levels, but I feel like I have to in order to level up enough to do well later. But the game doesn't have the kind of huge variety that something like Nethack or Binding of Isaac does. So, after only a few plays, those early levels are a bore. Then you finally get to something new only to be killed by a boss you don't have time to figure out. That's fine if I just wasted a few minutes getting to the boss (like in Dark Souls), but now I have to start from the beginning, and the early stages aren't interesting enough.\n\nThe enemies are often boring: flying enemies that move toward you and maybe shoot, and then tons and tons of turrets. The turrets shoot different things, but it quickly gets repetitive. The levels themselves are sometimes interesting, and there are hidden areas. However, there’s really not much to find given how the roguelike stuff works.\n\nIn the end, it's all just too hollow. After five deaths, I just don't feel like playing anymore. If you want an all-action bullet-hell FPS with minor roguelike elements, this is for you. If you want anything more than that, I'd say to skip it.","February 20, 2015","false","9.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ghazghul/recommended/266110/","ghazghul","Ghazghul","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ghazghul/","119 products in account","Tower of Guns is a perfect game for a quick injection of FPS action without gore or plot.  The enemies are robotic and bloodless and the story can even be turned off in the launch screen.  You can complete the game in a lunchtime but be warned that succeeding with every weapon / perk combo can become addictive.  Endless mode is exactly that and with some luck can result in 2-3hr+ runs.\n\nI grew up with Quake, QuakeWorld and Unreal Tournament.  The controls feel closest to UT which is not surprising as the engine is Unreal based.  The graphics are a UT / Borderlands hybrid and feel solid whilst providing a good seperation between enemies and backgrounds.  My modest PC didn't sffer slowdown even at later stages which are loaded with enemies and projectiles.  The weapons are varied and challenging to master and whilst feeling underpowerewd initially develop with levels and gun mods.\n\nMy only complaint is that a long run can end suddenly, even with full XP and health, upon meeting an especially packed room or incredibly powerfully enemy.  Often a health bar can be demolished before you have had a chance to react.  This can feel unfair, especially a long way into a run but is soon forgotten as you can be straight back in the action.","February 1, 2015","true","40.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Of course you do. How about roguelikes, hmm? Yeah, I thought so. Well, Tower of Guns is both. For reasons randomly generated at the beginning of a run, a person, with a gun, and a perk, must climb a deadly tower full of traps, turrets and ill-tempered robots. You only get two guns and perks to begin with, but unlock more as you play. You even get a shotgun for dying enough times. In true roguelike fashion, just about everything is randomized- which rooms you'll enter, which enemies will be there and what stats they'll have, what they'll drop and so on. The success of a run depends largely on two simple factors- your own talent for classic run-and-gun FPSs, and as always: not whether or not the random number god hates you, but exactly how much he does. The game's presentation is simplistic but effective, with good music and effective directional sound, making it a simple matter to determine what's about to ♥♥♥♥ up your run.

The lack of progression I don't really care for. i guess I prefer something more like Rogue Legacy where each run is different and a little "easier" but this was still fun. It's definitely crazy at times. Stuff flying everywhere, blowing up, spiked balls rolling around, guns popping up and I've barely gotten past the first level.\nThe way it works is it's randomly generated levels, you pick your weapon. Starts with two different ones (they don't have an alt-fire afaik). One is a basic blaster, shoots a little ball of light. The other was a "pizza shooter" that shoots whirling blades that bounce. It has a pretty slow ROF. I eventually unlocked a shotgun sort of thing. They all start incredibly weak, but as you kill the guns and stuff, it drops upgrade points. Eventually you upgrade your weapons, and you can find perks. The best I ever did was with a shotgun up to level 3 or 4 and had a rapid fire upgrade. That worked pretty well. I could one shot a lot of guns and things and the spread of the shot was ok.\nThe levels are pretty varied, I don't think I've entered the same room more than once. Sometimes they kinda suck, but usually they are pretty good/interesting. Sometimes it can get pretty hard because there will be catwalks above a long fall and there IS falling damage. Oh, on that note, you can choose between two perks at the beginning (unlock more later) either triple jump (which is what i always chose) or no fall damage. Jump isn't real high.\nMost rounds don't last real long, though the last one I was playing last night lasted longer than expected, cause I needed to get to bed (since we had to get up so early to come to the hospital) but it's not like you can save your spot. Or, well, I don't think so anyway. Might be something I will have to try.\noverall, this game gets a big thumbs up for me. It's a challenge, it's fun, it's hectic as hell. Careful for eye strain. Man I must have been staring pretty hard, because my eyes burned after that last round. Blink = death when some of those guns are shooting 12 missiles at you at once and there are 3 of those guns and a bunch of buzzsaws flying around and etc etc.\nControls are pretty good, graphics are nice (somewhat similar to borderlands), music is good.\nDefinitely will play again.","May 17","true","3.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

What an odd beast of a game.\n\nThere is no set basic premise to the game, as the story is randomly generated as well as all of the levels, enemies, rooms, etc. All you need to know is that this tower is out to kill you and you will watch that death counter go up a lot while trying to pull yourself through a first-person bullet hell.\n\nAt least you have upgrades to help you on your way.","May 28","true","17.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's got infinite replayability, a wide variety of guns, perks, abilities, and levels to play with. Not only that, it has a surprising amount of depth, from funny storylines, to eastereggs and secrets. It also has a wonderful difficulty curve, allowing for easy mode or hard mode, depending on what you want. It also features endless mode, where you loop the game until you die, allowing for insane runs at maximum speed with 40 extra jumps.\n\nOverall, this game is extremely fun, easy to get into, but hard to master. I 100% reccomend it. It's cheap, and will have you glued to your screen for hours of fun! :D","May 28","true","15.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
