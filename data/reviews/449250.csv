"http://steamcommunity.com/id/darksilverhawk/recommended/449250/","darksilverhawk","Darksilverhawk","http://steamcommunity.com/id/darksilverhawk/","157 products in account","A wonderful little Visual Novel based on the beloved turn-of-the-century novel in which you follow Sara, a quiet, imaginative, and kind young lady raised in India and sent away to England for schooling. The game features some light stat-raising elements and very light decision making, but it is primarily a linear story with optional events. In the second half of the game, the story divides into 6 distinct routes, each leading to a unique ending. The avaliblity of the routes depends on your actions in the first half of the story, so multiple playthroughs of the first act are required to see all the routes; fortunately, the game includes to option to skip through already-viewed scenes.\n\nThe writing is thoroughly enjoyable and adorable. Some of the routes feature light romantic elements, but not all of them do; you will find a range of different relationships from good friends, to nuturing parental figure, to sweetly romantic.\n\nOverall, a highly recommended VN, particularly if you're ok with something lighter on gameplay and focusing on narrative. If you're looking for a Princess Maker-style stat raiser, on the other hand, this one might not be for you.\n\nNote: This game was originally purchased directly from the developer and this review was posted immediately following the pre-Steam release beta period, so hours played might not line up with the actual length of this game.","May 19","true","1.3"," 39 of 43 people (91%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","91","39","43","4","0"

Might be the most precious game I've played.\n\nArt & MusicYou only need to look at the screenshots of the game to see that it has really beautiful art, with well-drawn backgrounds and character portraits that work together really well. The specific aspect that bumps this up though are CGs. They look amazing blown up on my widescreen monitor where all the little details can be easily pointed out. It must also be said that the same goes for the rest of the game. At least on my machine, it ran full widescreen with no indication of any stretched images, which for some reason is not as common as I would like in other works of the same genre. This game aced this part. I'm not really very good at describing music, but I have to say that this one tugged at my heartstrings way too often (to the point of abuse really). It fits the individual moments perfectly with every sense of dread, sadness, glee, or just plain heartwarming moments that make you go "d'awwww" while holding back tears. That won't work though, I tried, too many times.\n\nStory & GameplayThe story was paced really well and I didn't feel at any time in the game that it was moving too quickly or dragged out. Oh, and for people who haven't actually read the original novel this game was based on, do yourself the favor of not reading the story description as it contains a bit too much hints that I would've liked. Trust me, when THAT moment happens in the game, it'll be just a little bit more impactful, at least it was for me as someone who had no idea what was going to happen.(although I did sort of see it coming anyways, the way it was executed was still so good that I was genuinely suprised still). The writing is also excellent as it matches the setting of the game and gives enough flavor that no line would seem uninteresting or something to be skipped. I must also say that the writing is special in the sense that it could make the most simplest of lines sound so touching and heartwarming or heartbreaking. Again, paired with the music this REALLY leaves an impact. Gameplay wise, think Long Live the Queen except you won't be stressed out whatsoever. No need to stress your head on this one folks, just do what you think is the most optimal way and it probably is. Even if it's not, it'll still go well anyways. It's stat raising in order to meet requirements to progress on the different routes of the game. Although, I believe there's still one route that is unlocked even if you don't invest in it. So even if you don't bother with the gameplay and skip most of that, you'll still reach the end relatively unscathed.\n\nCharactersI'll just put this here separately as an emphasis on the fact that I LOVED every character that was supposed to be loved and I HATED the characters that were supposed to be hated. That's all really -- every one was fleshed out, had depth, and no one of value seemed flat.  Regarding Miss Michin and Cook, I don't think those even counted as human beings so they kind of don't count.\n\nAddendum: Hmm...what else can I say...oh yes. This cute little girl protagonist is a braver person and a better ladykiller than I can ever hope to be. I cried more than she did while playing through just one route. So yeah, there's that.","May 19","true","0.1"," 25 of 29 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","25","29","2","0"

The visual novel aspect is about developing relationships with the secondary characters. You develop stats based on what you choose to do with your free time and trigger scenes with the other girls if your stats meet certain requirements. There isn't enough time to get through everyone's scenes but I've gotten through three girls' scenes in a single playthrough. In Act II you have to pick one girl to have scenes with but if you save at the beginning of Act II you can avoid repeating Act I for everyone.\n\nAs any shoujo-ai fan will tell you, "Lily" being in the title means there's gonna be some girl-love. It's very mild. Some cuddling and only one girl actually pushes past "romantic friendship" into "schoolgirl lesbian" territory.\n\nI think this game is suitable for any little girls who can read well enough. But be prepared to discuss death, poverty, classism, and romance between girls as necessary.\n\nBecause everyone seems to ask: No, there is no death ending.","May 21","true","10.3"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","12","12","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lokuul/recommended/449250/","Lokuul","Sara Crewe","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lokuul/","269 products in account","Finished the last route in "A Little Lily Princess," which is another amazing game from Hanako Games (under the name Hanabira).\n\nAs per usual with games from Hanako, you play a young girl, in this case Sara Crewe, who performs activities every week to increase a number of skills (such as Sympathy or Grace). With these skill increases, you unlock different routes and scenes for each of the six potential girls that you can romance (which is where "A Little Lily Princess" differs from Hanako's acclaimed "Long Live the Queen").\n\nYou will, through these interactions (as well as the weekly slice, as I call it), learn about these characters. You have the fire-haired Jessie, a ballerina with an eye for curiosity; Lavinia, the haughty model student at Miss Minchin's Seminary; Lottie, the little girl who knows how to throw a tantrum; Ermengarde, the soft country girl who makes up her lack of wit with her heart of gold; Marriette, Sara's personal maid from France; and Becky, the poor, downtrodden scullery maid.\n\nIf you recognise a few of these names, then perhaps you have read the book that this VN is based from: "A Little Princess," written by Frances Hodgson Burnett in 1905. If you have read it, then this will be a lovely treat, but if you haven't, do not seek this book out if you do not wish to be spoiled. You have been warned.\n\nGoing back to the game, I cannot recommend it enough. You may ask me a favourite route, and I will simply chuckle and say "All of them!" Each one of these girls has their own story, their own motivations, their own wants and desires and fears, and truly I felt ever the better to experience their lives, if only for a moment.","May 25","true","83.0"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

I really loved every moment of this precious visual novel. I felt like I was sharing the happy, sad, joyous and tragic moments with Sara and the other girls.\n\nThe writing is really well done, all the characters are interesting and loveable (except those that aren't loveable, yes, I'm seeing to you, Miss Minchin). And truth to be told, several times while playing my eyes became misty.\nThe art is lovely, with a cute character design, adorable chibis and beautiful CG. The latter are just breath taking. Wonderful work.\nAnd the music. Is just great. Really enhances the experience. In the climax of the story, the music is used perfectly, give me goosebumps.\n\nFinally, the routes, are all wonderful. Most are romantic. Others more friendship. Some, depends if you squint or not while  playing. But all are fantastic. I love all of them.\n\nIn conclusion, a wonderful game which carried me for eighteen hours (six of them played on the beta, more or less) to the Victorian England, and to the lives of those wonderful girls.\nMy only complain is that I just want more. But, of course, that is me being greedy. I can't have enough cute lovely Victorian yuri.","May 28","true","11.7"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","1"

The main storyline is written in such a way as to make Sara highly sympathetic but not sickeningly angelic. The individual storylines are very well-written and provide some fascinating insights into the characters.\n\nMy only criticism is that there aren't very many decisions to be made, unlike the other Hanako game I've played, Long Live The Queen. But that would be a consequence of following the plot of A Little Princess. I like games with more decision-making, and the activity planning seemed a little pointless in this game.\n\nThat's about all, though. Emotionally, this game was very satisfying, and I don't mind admitting how often I cried while playing it. I heartily recommend it to anyone who enjoys moving, emotional narratives.","May 23","true","11.6"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sevenfoothamster/recommended/449250/","sevenfoothamster","sevenfoothamster","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sevenfoothamster/","333 products in account","This was a rather unique experience for me. I've played visual novels before, and I had a cursory knowledge of the source material going in.\n\nIn short, this is a visual novel retelling of the story "A Little Princess." It takes a few liberties with the source material such as Miss Minchin's sister being completely absent, and they created one character wholecloth.\n\nBeing a visual novel, there's really not much that you can expect from the game. The interface is clean, the mechanics are explained well enough, though the RNG element can make it frustrating if you're shooting for a specific ending. Jessie's route, for example, requires a high number of high count skills, while characters like Mariette and Becky tend to have lower costs. It also completely goes out the window in the second have of the game, where you can completely cheese the system.\n\nHow you feel about this game's plot will depend greatly on how you feel about the source material. If you don't like Victorian era novels with social commentary that inflict misfortunate on characters that don't deserve it, you probably won't like it.\n\nI won't go into TOO much detail on the plot, but suffice to say the game takes a turn at the halfway point, and the mechanics do so as well.\n\nThat said I actually like it a bit BETTER than the source material. The characters are much more fleshed out and less one-dimensional, especially Lavinia and Jessie, who in the novel were "a rich bully and her hanger-on." Lavinia becomes a much more complicated character, and Jessie actually GETS a character.\n\nAbout the only disappointment is that some of the stories needed a bit more time to develop. Jessie and Mariette's work out fine, but Lavinia probably could have used a few extra scenes since she undergoes the most drastic change.\n\nAlso there's a lack of a "golden ending," you have to pick ONE path to the end, and it's more of a sidestory. The game ends the same way the book does, though Sara may get one more additional companion if she chooses someone other than Mariette or Becky (they go with her no matter what).\n\nAnd, uh, that brings me to the last point. The sorta elephant in the room: I haven't finished ALL the routes, only half, but 2/3 of those are effectively lesbian love stories. Naturally I'd imagine the total number of lesbians would be 4 out of the 6, as Mariette's too old and Lottie's too young, but I've been wrong before. Safe to say, though, Jessie's definitely a lesbian in this version, and Lavinia's probably Sara-sexual. Though given Sara's personality, it could just be them attracted to HER specifically.\n\nBecause...maybe it's just because my experience with the source material is primarily the film adaptations (where the dad is kept alive. Spoiler alert for a 110 year old book: He really IS dead in the novel) and maybe it's the perspective and choice given to you, the player...but Sara feels a little stronger here.\n\nAnyway, in short, I recommend this VN. It's the type of thing I'd like to see more of: retellings of classic stories that give the player more control over events. It would certainly help mitigate possible plotholes.","May 23","true","18.8"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

So I shall give a review for all people pondering to buy this game.\n(Note: I have not yet finished the game so I cannot give a full review as of now.)\n\nArt and Appearence The art style is a mix of Victorian and Anime/Manga. I completely enjoy the art style and find it as a relaxing overlook to the more serious moments in game. The appearence of the game is calming. My only problem with it is the backrounds are a bit too whimsical for my taste. (Again, this is my personal prefrence. So, if you enjoy it I can understand. I just think it dosen't fit the tone of the game.)\n\nMusic and Sounds The music is nice piano music that I like. (If you don't like classical you won't like this music.) Along with other orchestral music. It fits the Victorian scene, if you ask me. I personaly like it. (After playing for a while it does get a bit overused.)\n\nCharacters Some are quite bland but, most are interesting and you can connect with them. My personal favorite is Lottie. (SHE'S CUTE... OKAY. I LIKE CUTE THINGS...) But, in all seriousness I realy like the characters and I think the studio did a good job.\n\nStory IF YOU READ THE LITTLE PRINCESS AND LIKED IT YOU WILL LOVE THIS. LIKE SERIOUSLY. LOVE IT.\nThe story is an adapted version of The Little Princess. I think (so far) it's been preaty close to the real book. (Without copying of course) I like the story.

I feel that the life simulator portion of the game does not add much value at all to the gaming experience here, and feels more like a waste of time for me, but it is just my personal opinion of course.\n\nAll in all though, I LOVE this game and I think it is worth every penny!","June 1","true","25.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","2"

The girls are very loveable, and it is interesting to see how Sara's relationship with them changes over the course of the story. My only complaint is that the gameplay elements don't mean much after youve locked yourself onto a particular characters path as it is more a currency to unlock events than a set of stats to be raised. Regardless though I very much enjoyed playing this game.","May 25","true","13.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I have very high standards so I do not use  these terms lightly. Even if you are not a fan of yuri or of visual novels in general I still highly recomend this game. I enjoyed it far more than expected and will continue to enjoy it in the future. You are missing a spectacular VN if you do not buy A Little Lily Princess.","June 2","true","21.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
