"http://steamcommunity.com/id/digivampire/recommended/322440/","digivampire","digivampire","http://steamcommunity.com/id/digivampire/","669 products in account","As an early backer of this game, I'm sadened that I cannot recommend this game in its current state. The idea and execution had a lot of potential, and while it delivers some of it, this is by no means a finished game.\n\nFirst and foremost the game is extremely buggy. This barely even feels like an alpha. How can you release a game so full of bugs is beyond me. In the first 70min of game time I have had the game crash 2 times, get stuck once and hang once. I deleted the first save slot in order to restart the game and the intro just hanged while the audio went on, the application was unresponsive and had to be killed. Another go this time it worked, but literally 10min into the game, once in the shaman house, the shaman did not spawn on the platform to be raised up so the game got stuck, since I could not exit or continue in any way. Close and reload from last save point had me redo last 5min of play time. Then it crashed on a load of crystal cave area. Another reload, and I made some good progress until I got to 9 crystals required area. I jumped as divine and tried to possess, guess no one tried that before. Instant crash. All this in just an hour of play time.\n\nThe gaphics looks good, cartoony blocky feel to it which I liked. Audio is fairly lacking, the dialogs are all text, and seem very unpolished, forced and unimaginative. Not to be confused with the narator, who is exactly the opposite and has been done well.\n\nDivine's movement and combat feels bit clunky in every aspect. While the movement is smooth on its own, jumping is not very precise. The combat system at least in the beginning since I haven't had a chance to progress later into the game is very simplistic in combat forms, punch and uppercut that's it. The focus seems to be on switching forms and evasion which forces you to evaluate your tactic and it certainly adds to the experience. Divine can also possess/detonate other creatures which is instant kill and when used properly can give you huge advantage. You are vulnerable while switching forms so some planning is required.\n\nThere is no pointer telling you in which direction to go for your next quest location, you have to open a map every single time. The map is functional, but looking pretty crappy due to graphics scaling. The menu system seems to have been done hastily and as an after thought. Hit boxes are unclear or just down right wrong when it comes to enemies and environment. Case in point is spikes on platforms that turn around. It's clear if you duck under them they shouldn't be able to hit you, but they do anyway.\n\nPlease finish this game, I'd love to see it shine for all the potential it has, but as it stands right now I can't recommend this to anyone.\n\n2/10","September 6, 2015","false","2.9"," 22 of 25 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","22","25","2","1"

Honestly no one believes in Metacritic anymore but in case you do simply check the USERS reviews and see that people seems to like this game (and I've read some of the official reviews and they're COMPLETELY WRONG in what they say). So don't missjudge the game by the number 'cause once again they might not be reliable at all.\n\nAs someone who has been following this game almost from the scratch, I'll try to write a review as accurate as possible, pointing out stuff from the game and from its background.\n\nFirst of all, I took this game seriously since I don't see many interesting games coming out from my native country, so it's always a cool feeling. I could also get access to the beta (as this review might feature as soon as it becomes public) trying to see what aspects of the game can be polished, and what stays catchy. So I'll try to gather both pros and cons.\n\nRed Goddess: Inner World is a 2.5D side-scroller exploration metroidvania made by a 6-people team, where you take control of Divine, a young girl who lost her memories and mainly spends the whole game trying to figure out what happened to her and her godly family. During her journey Divine will find people who were relevant in her past life and that will help her recovering her memories.\n\nPROS:\n\n+ A game beautifully made, with more than a decent artwork and interesting exploring areas.\n+ Relaxing soundtrack; not that memorable, but does its job.\n+ As a metroidvania, in terms of platforming, it's a surprisingly consistent title. It starts being a bit plane and simple but becomes much more interesting as soon as you keep getting new movement skills.\n+ Collectibles based on new skins.\n+ 3 forms for the main character: one based on movement, and the other ones based on combat. Enemies will have the same color as one of those transformations, and you will have to take it down with the proper one. This adds more interest into the battles.\n+ A detailed map denying any confusion about where you are and where you have to go.\n+ The game takes from 5-10h to beat, mainly depending on user's skills. Which is more than enough for a side-scroller.\n+ Interesting story that keeps you entertained and waiting for more.\n+ In terms of difficulty, the game grows pretty fast, being completely fearless in the first hours but challenging in the second half unless you're used to those kind of platformers.\n+ Chilling achievements, mainly based on combat stuff and storyline. No achievements based on collectibles which is definately positive.\n\nCONS:\n\n- Even though the game features enough skills to play with, combat is not as soft as the platforming thing. Not a con really, I enjoyed the battles, but I felt like there was no real difference between enemies (excluding bosses), and specially in the way I play to kill them.\n- More linear than it intends to be. No sidequests.\n- Very few upgrade options, only based on HP and MP.\n- I wish there was more voice acting.\n- Minor bugs that probably won't affect your gameplay but are there.\n\nOverall, I'm happy this industry is also spreading into my country, and more and more consistent games are coming from here. I won't support this game for being spanish though; I support it because I enjoyed Red Goddess. This is my type of game and I had a good experience with it. And the further you go into the game, the better it becomes. It's a good title and hopefully you will ignore stupid, senseless reviews giving this game a mild 10/100.","September 1, 2015","true","5.1"," 20 of 29 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","20","29","0","6"

Like other metroidvania games, you unlock skills and powerups throughout the game to access other areas of the game world. One thing I found interesting was that there is an omniscient narrator that follows your every move during the game. So far in my gameplay, the game features a lot of forests, mountains, and other nature settings. The game's graphics are very beautiful, you get the feeling that you are in a hand drawn painting the entire time, and that along with the narrator gives you a very immersive gaming experience. I will update this review as I play more of the game but I feel that this game offers a unique take on the metroidvania genre and is something fans of games like Dust: An Elysian Tail or Ori and the Blind Forest should pick up immediately!","September 7, 2015","true","0.5"," 18 of 27 people (67%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","67","18","27","4","0"

Animation is superb, music is atmospheric, and the controls are tight.  Unfortunatly,  it has crashed for me at the 44 minute mark both times I've run it.  I'm going to reccomend it based on the notion that I think it has a lot to offer, and I don't expect much from a game under 10 bucks, but I'm also going to keep my fingers crossed that my crashing has been some sort of freak coincidence, and that I won't have to spend my future sessions with a timer running in the background.","September 4, 2015","true","7.9"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","6","8","2","0"

Then this might just be the game for you.\n\nEnter the mind of Devine, a troubled young goddess with a lot of burdens to bear. Starting off as weak and powerless she searches a forgotten realm for the memories of a life long lost and gradually gains the strength to take on her unknown enemy.\n\nThe characters in this game are great; I wanted to learn so much more about them and the world in which they inhabit. The story was very intriguing as well; although it is somewhat easy to figure out I was still very happy to see its conclusion. The game is not overly long but its long enough to get your money’s worth in my opinion, especially if you plan on collecting coins and character skins.\n\nThe art style was very pretty too, I loved the bright vivid colours and cartoonish design of everything. The exploding light effects when slaying an enemy are particularly impressive. The environments themselves are pretty and have diversity about them, from deepest caves to sweet happy little villages this game covers a lot in a short amount of time. The soundtrack is catchy too; I really liked it and found myself humming along to a couple of the songs a few times.\n\nThis game is a ton of fun, the powers and abilities we are given add a subtle depth to the combat and exploration that whilst having been done before is very well implemented in this title. The ability to switch the characters mask at will was a nice feature and stopped the combat from becoming stale. But fair warning the controls on the other hand were lacking and imprecise, in my opinion it added to the charm of the title I can see some becoming annoyed with them. Also towards the end there is a huge difficulty spike that drove me insane, but it felt so great when I finally overcame it.\n\nAt full price I would be really - hard pressed to recommend this due to its simplicity, a couple crashes and sometimes frustrating controls, but when on sale or if you are metroidvania fan then this is a buy, it’s still a nice adventure through a wonderful world and I am looking forward to any other titles in the series.\n\nHave Fun ^_^","December 30, 2015","true","10.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

While hard to describe the visuals in Red Goddess: Inner World are great. I think the visuals are the best part of the game.\n\nRed Goddess: Inner World is more than just the visuals. The game plays like a Metroidvania game. Most of the game involves platforming and fighting. The platforming is not highly original but it is enjoyable. Like a Metroidvania game you will end up revisiting several areas of the game world that you already visited once you have gained new abilities that let you access new areas you couldn't reach before.\n\nWhile the combat is fine, I was a little disappointed with it. While I like that you need to switch between forms in order to hurt the different types of enemies, at times you just end up mashing buttons. I wish there was a little more variety to the combat. Generally you just keep hitting the punch button with an occasional dodge thrown in.\n\nI also kind of found the game to be a little on the easy side. The difficulty reaches a medium difficulty towards the end but a majority of the game is quite easy and doesn't provide a lot of challenge.\n\nOverall I thought Red Goddess: Inner World was a good game. I had fun with the game. If you like these type of games I think you would like Red Goddess: Inner World.\n\nNote: I received a free review copy of the game. Other than receiving the free review copy I received no other compensation for this review and the free review copy had no influence on what is written in this review.\n\nRead My Full Review [www.geekyhobbies.com]","September 4, 2015","true","5.9"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","5","8","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lenormal/recommended/322440/","Lenormal","Lenormal","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lenormal/","502 products in account","I can't recommend this to anyone unfortunately, i was excited about it, but it just feels a bit too bland. It doesn't do anything terribly wrong, but there's not enough that it does to make itself worthy of a recommendation.\n\nThe story: Its a bit convoluted as its all apparently taking place inside of your soul or your inner being, the world is actually you? Something metaphysical and quite honestly maybe some people will appreciate the uniqueness of it, it comes across to me as bland and uninteresting. I don't usually mind stories that are a bit out there, I loved transistor, but that story worked well because of all the great personalities within it, this game doesnt have that. Its a lot of restore your memories and remember the past events, and the enemies are manifestations of your anger and fear but they're also golems which are being sent by the king to kill you so... which is it game? I always thought trying to be a bit out there doesn't work for this style of mainly combat and platformer focused gameplay. But again, this is more personal, some people may enjoy where i just kinda feel eh about it.\n\nVisuals: The background art is pretty good, but the actual character models, enemies, and townfolk are all pretty bland or lifeless as far as animation ect is concerned. It looks pretty good in screen shots, but as for certain story sequences, the lack of appealing visually interesting story characters makes it seem very generic. Although this is party due to the  writing helping it feel so very cliche, villagers say "i am very busy i don't have time to talk to you" but literally stand there lifeless without any animation at all. I have to give them credit though, for a team of 6 people that made this, it is an amazing amount of work, but its just such a shame that it feels incomplete, like they just didn't have the time to finish giving the game that final polish it needs to come to life.\n\nMusic and sound: Music is decent, nothing amazing so far but not terrible, suits the backgrounds pretty well but nothing memorable so far. Unfortunately, the narrator doesn't exactly make the story interesting. The narrator is ok, a bit monotone mostly, and everyonce in a while seems to be evil and against you, its very odd. But since its basically the only voice in the game there's not much too it, I suppose I'm not overly enthused about him tho partly due to my disinterest in the storyline.\n\nGameplay: While it does have the metroidvania's nonlinear worlds, everything is very linear as far as exploration. Area's are locked off until you collect x amount of crystals, they're not hard to find, and really doesn't leave any optional exploration beyond this. There hasn't been any side power ups to find on the side (minus skins which are hidden), no destructible walls, and while there are upgrades, so far they are mostly unlocking basic mechanics for the game. There are a few interesting movement mechanics like levitation that come in much later, but a case of too little too late. The game moves smoothly and controls are responsive and feel good for platforming. However the action is very basic. There are red and blue enemies, so once you have the red and blue forms unlocked, you simply turn the color of the enemy and punch them to kill. You have a regular punch, an uppercut, and a special punch which uses mana. There is a roll to dodge while in your rage or fear forms, and in your regular form you get a few extra platforming abilities. Again, its not bad and it works at a basic level, but it fails to be interesting enough to really get excited over. In your regular form you get a special to posess enemies, but it doesn't really amount to anything interesting since the only thing you can make them do is self destruct. I thought the concept would have been cool to possess enemies and use specific mobs to solve puzzles but it never gets that complex\n\nFinal thoughts: For a game made by an small indie studio I can recognize the huge amount of work that went into this, but I think a stronger focus on unique interesting mechanics would have made the game better overall. If you're really urging for a metroidvania this one might rub the itch, but definately will leave you wanting something with a bit more to it.\n\n6/10","September 9, 2015","false","4.3"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

Also and this is not a reason not to buy the game but it is rediculously hard in some spots there are lots of things in the game that can one shot kill you at which the narrator constantly drones on when you die the same three or four phrasese over and over then a loading screen.Then you may have to play through a large area again with no checkpoint.  After about the 900th time dieing this becomes a little maddening.\n\nThere is at least three different areas that the game crashes constantly ive came across so far that need to be patched. Which is why i cant recommend the game at present. If this gets fixed even though its insanely hard id still recommend it because im sure some people enjoy that sort of challenge. Apparently as ive gotten older i am NOT one of them lol.\n\nThe game itself is not that bad and the artstyle looks really great the game is actually fun but theres some frustrating portions in it. One is where if you die in this area where the ceiling is falling down on you, you have to watch a cutscene over each time until you get through the area. Theres also quite a few other areas that its like the game is not that hard but it becomes hard when youre having to play through a whole area again because theres not a checkpoint there. The story is pretty interesting, the controls are decent, still not exactly "spot on" but theyre tight enough that you can do most of the jumps with no problems. The main thing im talking about is when you go to jump in the air and trying to guide yourself back down to get coins etc it feels a little wonky. Hard to explain like theyre almost too tight if that makes sense. I feel like there should be a little bit more of a dead zone when in the air. I was playing this with a controller btw. Also theres skins in the game you pick up i had no idea how to even apply or what they were for, i found no information on this.","January 2","false","4.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mst3kforever/recommended/322440/","mst3kforever","MST3Kforever","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mst3kforever/","984 products in account","Do not buy this game.\n\nHaving now played both the Playstation 4 and Steam versions of this game, I can confirm that it is impossible to play thirty minutes of this game on either platform without encountering multiple game crashing bugs.  During my time with the Playstation 4 version I was able to soft lock the game two different ways before reaching the fourth area.  The first was when I picked up the collectible Gem right after leaving the room where you got your first memory before the babysitter began her dialogue, the gate read it as a sequence break and caused my character to freeze in place.  I could pause the game, but that was it.  After that I reloaded the game and found various progression essential NPC’s began disappearing from the world before I could interact with them.  There were also numerous other smaller graphical and collision glitches, as well as a several spelling and grammatical errors, that showed the complete lack of polish and quality control found all throughout this game.\n\nThe Steam version is, if anything, worse. The frame rate stuttered its way to an average 15-20 frames a second on the opening cut scene, and the game would freeze and stutter dangerously ever time it tried to load assets for the next area.  While I was able to get further in the game then I did on the PS4, this time instead of soft locking the game just crashed to my desktop while I was riding an elevator in the Crystal Caves shortly after getting the Rage mask about 25 minutes in this time.  Again, there were numerous smaller glitches and problems found all throughout the game.  I wanted to like this game, I really did.  But it is far to flawed to recommend, and the fact that the creators wish to call this a “finished” version makes me unsure if I want to laugh or cry.  This game should not be released in this unpolished and unplayable condition.  Several changes and fixes have been implemented from the Playstation 4 version, but if you must play this game I would recommend waiting until October when the Xbox One version of the game is due to be released.  Perhaps third time will be the charm, though giving this game’s current track record, I doubt it.\n","September 2, 2015","false","0.5"," 6 of 14 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","6","14","0","4"
