This game you will find in mobile devices too.\n\nWell, when im started to play this game, i never heard about it. In the past i remembed seed somewhere this classic board game in real life, but never played it. Now im fixing that issue.\n\nIn this game now you will find a one and two player mode, in future its been updated with online multiplayer to. When you start a game you can choose from 3 difficulty levels and 2 board style (but i think a classical seems better). When you play, you can do 3 actions in each round, you can do two tilt and one move or one tilt and two moves. To destroy the enemy piece you should use at least two balls, to destroy the enemy balls you should use at least 3 balls. In a game your final goal is to kill the enemy "king" or get your king to the opponent kings square.\nThe graphics looks clear and simple. The sound effects sounds good.\n\nSo my verdict\n\n+good sound effect\n+nice classical board game\n+good animation\n+challenging\n+good to relax\n\n-a bit high price\n-no multiplayer at this moment (will be added in future)\n\nSo this game is a classical board game, what you can now try out on pc too. This game challenging and can improve your strategical view. A price is a bit high, but if you find on sale and you are a fan of board games it can be instant buy to you.","March 12","true","1.7"," 12 of 19 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","12","19","0","0"

Online Muliplayer is not supported yet as far as I know so its limited to LAN only.\n\nThe graphic and gameplay is good with no form of bugs or glitches as of yet.\n\nI would recommend it but not worth the full price. Get it only on sale. (I got the game with 75% off sale)\n\n8/10","February 10","true","20.2"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

This game looks great and and has the most simplistic in depth strategic flare I wonder why I havent seen it anywhere before... Epic!","October 30, 2015","true","4.3"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","8","15","0","0"
