You'd guess that the game is available in English since all of the store's description of the game comes written in English, but no, the first of the challenges this game has imposed on me was the requisite of learning Japanese in order to get past the start menu. There's choice, too. You can choose to play without knowledge of Japanese and still proceed but you're not guaranteed to fully grasp what's happening.\n\nI'm not quite there yet with the Japanese but in two or three years I'll be ready to go on with the next challenge: installing AppLocale.","December 9, 2015","true","0.1"," 273 of 421 people (65%) found this review helpful 372 people found this review funny","65","273","421","372","21"

I played the DOS version when I was younger. This is a great game that is pretty strategic. Lots of hours of fun.\n\nUpon installation, you might notice that the text in the game is garbled, unplayable at first. The game is encoded in Japanese, so you need to change some settings to see the Japanese text. In order for the game to work on Windows 10, go to: Control Panel\Clock, Language, and Region, then click on Region. In the Region popup, click the Administrative tab, click on Change system locale to Japanese (Japan), and restart your computer.\n\nNow, here's the tricky part. I don't know Japanese. And if you don't, either, it can be pretty frustrating to play. I remember messing around with it when I was little, so I sort of know what to do. But for those of you who don't know what things to click, go download Google Translate on your smartphone, select Japanese -> English, Then take a picture of the screen, highlight the words, and it'll be instantly translated. Then, remember what those symbols meant, and enjoy the game!","December 10, 2015","true","0.5"," 75 of 120 people (63%) found this review helpful 35 people found this review funny","63","75","120","35","2"

Very nostalgic, and the massive options available for scenario making is a very big plus. Though is there any way to actually share created scenarios or publically release them here on Steam, aside from using Twitter?\n\nAlso, personally I'd have had preferred the option to make scenarios using systems from various RTK games (namely III and IV) rather than just using II's system; Why not, Koei Tecmo? Super Mario Maker allowed making levels using different Mario game engines, and those two aforementioned games are the ones most people are more familiar with and likely was introduced to the RTK game series by (especially growing up with SNES/Super Famicom), anyway.","January 18","true","11.8"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","44","4","9","0","0"
