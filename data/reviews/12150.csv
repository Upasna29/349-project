"http://steamcommunity.com/id/miyumiayase/recommended/12150/","miyumiayase","Miyumi Ayase","http://steamcommunity.com/id/miyumiayase/","288 products in account","TL:DR? See Conclusion\nINTRODUCTION:Max Payne 2: Fall of Max Payne is the sequel to the critically acclaimed and award winning 2001 game, Max Payne. Max Payne 2 is a Third-Person action shooter developed by Remedy Entertainment which was acquired by Rockstar Games whose notable works include the popular Grand Theft Auto (GTA) franchise.\n\nOnce again the player steps into the shoes of Max Payne, a New York City Detective who, after the events of the first game, went on a downward spiral both in career and personal life, struggling with the death of his family and his newly formed Pain Killer addiction (the direct result of the pain killers taken by the player in the first game to regenerate lost health). While Max is investigating a series of murders and assassinations, Max encounters Mona Sax, a textbook femme fatale who was presumed dead from the first game. Follow Max and Mona's adventure through New York City and discover a conspiracy behind a Mob War between two rival Mafia groups and a deadly team of hitmen called 'The Cleaners' in this film noir love story.\n\nPROS:+ Significant and highly noticeable improvements on the graphics, animation and texture quality from the first title\n+ Better sounds, voice acting and sound track\n+ Improvements on the innovative Bullet Time game mechanic\n+ Great locations and level design which goes well with the better graphical fidelity\n+ Graphic Novel style cutscenes are back and with better delivery\n+ Expanded weapon variety\n+ Mission variety\n+ Challenging Difficulty levels (the game provides a good challenge on any difficulty setting)\n+ Adaptive difficulty if the player is on Easy Mode. (AI gets toned down and pain killers heal more if the player dies too much on Easy Mode.)\n+ Magnificent story that surpasses even the first game\n+ World is ALIVE and more immersive.\n\nCONS:- VERY Short (I personally completed it within 5-6 hours)\n\nOTHER NOTE:- Replayability: - Linear storytelling is FINE, its a good way to tell a narrative story in a directed pace but Linearity does sacrifice replayability at degree because, after finishing the story, there is little reason to play through it a second time around. Like a good action movie, it's best to be played again after some time has passed. (Copy Pasted from my Max Payne 1 Review)\n\nCONCLUSION:I rarely call something a 'MASTERPIECE' but after playing through the whole game, twice (once on my Xbox back in 2005, once again on my PC 2013), and sitting here writing this review, I cannot find any more CONs aside from the short story. Contrast this to the PROS I listed, I can easily say we have an almost perfect action game. Max Payne 2 blends perfectly the immersive storytelling of a good action movie, and the dynamic adrenaline pumping gameplay of a video game.\n\nMUST BUY and HIGHLY RECOMMENDED for both new and old fans a like. I do, however, not recommend you buy this game solo but instead, BUY the MAX PAYNE BUNDLE which includes the Original Max Payne and Max Payne 2. At $15, this is a game worth your time and money.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\nLike my Reviews?

Of all three entries this one is my favourite. I loved it enough that when it came on Steam I ended up rebuying the damn thing despite owning a rather beautiful physical copy beforehand.\n\nThe story is knit so tight and full of noir that whatever comes after feels like they are trying to hard. Max Payne also defines adult emo to such an amazing level that one is tempted to start cutting one's wrist while desperately trying to find the adult equivalent of Linkin Park. That is of course easily remedied by the awesome and moody track that plays in background as you weave through the dark New York city trying to find closure to all the demons that live in Max's head.\n\nIt may have aged, and it doesn't offer the same high fidelity as its modern counterparts, but when you get to the nitty gritty, Max Payne 2 is one of the finest shooter in the market.\n\nIf only Max Payne 3 could have followed in its footsteps.","November 25, 2013","true","0.3"," 67 of 85 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","67","85","0","0"

Max Payne 2 is moreso inspired by romance stories. The main character is portrayed far more realistically, as a depressed lonely individual who has gotten everything he wanted at the end of the last game. And then a girl from his past re-enters his life and thrusts him on another adventure into the night. I wouldn't say the story was perfect, it is a little short and doesn't have the same mythological basis as the first. But it does it's job and I respect Remedy for attempting to do something different.\n\nThe gameplay was greatly improved, with a true physics engine and reworked AI. The maps were also made a lot larger and the action a lot more upscale. With friendly AI and a survival mode referred to as "Dead Man Walking". Max Payne 2 was a great way to finish Remedy's involvement with the franchise, and is truly a smashing successor to the original.","December 19, 2013","true","26.6"," 33 of 34 people (97%) found this review helpful","97","33","34","0","5"

The game could be best described as noir-style love story, in contrast to the first that was more of a film noir revenge tale.\n\nNYPD detective Max Payne is once again the primary protagonist, although a few very interesting segments sees you play as his love interest, Mona Sax. Max Payne 2 borrows a lot from the original and there are enough hints and references to the previous game which helps keep the narrative interesting and fresh for old-timers.\n\nMax Payne 2 is, in many ways, a huge improvement over Max Payne 1. Gone is that constipated look  replaced instead with full 3-D modeled faces. The game also sees an immense graphical upgrade with excellent usage of the Havok 2.0 physics engine. Game characters are more detailed while environment objects, including enemies, tumble and fall very realistically.\n\nGameplay is largely the same with a few refinements to combat. Bullet Time sees an upgrade allowing you to dodge bullets and reload quickly, with a cool whirling animation to go alongside it. This results in a higher body count but also makes gun-play segments a whole lot less challenging. Level designs are, once again, brilliant with mission locales ranging from warehouses, mansions, hospitals and clubs to constructions sites. And the enemy AI is, on a whole, pretty decent although in a few instances they end up killing themselves with their own grenade.\n\nThe plot is riveting with almost non-stop action throughout. The storyline unfolds in much the same fashion as the original. The usage of graphic novel comics complete with melodramatic over-the-top dialogue sucks you into the game's environment. If anything, the writing is more polished this time around with lots of witty and philosophical quotes thrown into the mix. The story focuses too much upon the love-story angle though which tends to get a bit jarring towards the end. In comparison, the original Max Payne's story, although slightly rough around the edges, was more dark, grittier and compelling than its sequel.\n\nFor a game that is over twelve years old, Max Payne 2 still holds remarkably well today. It overshadows the original in many aspects while also introducing a few cool mechanics of its own. Simplified mechanics make for interesting combat segments making Max Payne 2 one of the very best third-person shooters ever made.","August 22, 2015","true","12.5"," 33 of 35 people (94%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","94","33","35","3","2"

The overall plot feels a bit lame if you compare it to the first game, but it has a lot of redeeming moments, and the gameplay and graphics have both been finetuned a lot since the first game, which makes it very enjoyable. It is definitely worth a play if you haven't played it before. As many classics, however, you have to keep in mind that the game is set in a different era of gaming, and that the gameplay isn't the same standard as it is today.\n\nIf you plan on playing Max Payne 3, you will definitely want to pick this one and the first one up as well.","March 20, 2014","true","6.0"," 30 of 33 people (91%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","91","30","33","6","0"

I really really loved Timothy Gibbs for Max and Kathy Tong for Mona.\nAlso the gameplay is really smooth, easier to survive compared to the first game mechanism-wise, smarter AI, better slo-mo bullettime feature, better gun design and scripting.\n\nWhat impressed me most about this game is the movie-like quality of the naration and the perfectly scripted quotes in it.\nThe game feels like a dramatic movie that sucks you down to its darkness which bewitches you to not wanna get out.\nTransforming the line into a blur to what's black or white, what's good or bad, what's life or death, the unique experience of following Max Payne through the events of the game leaved me beyond satisfied.\n\nThe game also supports mods, and there are tons out there, which increases its replayability value.\n\nGlad to have played this game for once more and totally recommending and urging you all who haven't, to buy this asap and play it now. Especially if you are into action/mafia genre games with a strong taste of Noir Drama.","January 23, 2015","true","44.4"," 19 of 22 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","19","22","0","0"

Max Payne 2 The Fall of Max Payne is a fantastic experience from start to end. Especially if you have the Cinema 2.0 Mod which I used in my playthrough of the game. (The Mod really enhances the experience).\n\nStorywise this game is interesting, compelling, and tells a dark tale of Max Payne. Max lost his wife and kid in the previous game and in this one he loses even more (I'm not going to spoil it). The story is told not through cutscenes like in modern games but through something like out of a Graphic Novel. The game is told through 3 Acts all having about 6 to 8 Chapters.\n\nGameplay wise this game has it perfected. It's an old school shooter. It's fun, fast, and can be difficult at times (Except in the last chapter where there is practically painkillers around every damn corner) and Bullet Time is a fantastic feature which allows you to slow down time and shoot in slow-mo just like in an action movie (You can even dodge and jump forward in Slow-Mo). There is also a lot of guns (Even a Minigun) but you lose them in certian chapters and have to collect them again. You do all of this in Third Person which makes it even cooler seen Max dodge bullets and shoot punks.\n\nGraphics still hold up today. This game looks great and very little loading screens (only when you get to a new chapter) and character models looks great. It's not any Next-Gen Graphics but it's great vanilla and looks even better with Graphical Mods you can download.\n\nDo I recommend this game? Yes.

I'm sure that not exactly very many of you are going to be swayed to buy the game or anything like that. Yet I still want to recommend an absolutely fantastic mod that caught my eye for the game and I have been playing through.\n\nPayne Evolution takes a classic game and makes it even better by refining it with some of the features and improvements of Max Payne 3. Every gun is replaced by a new variant from Max Payne 3, new dialogue is is introduced when Max picks up painkillers ("I was self-medicating, like a good American") and the MP3 bullet time effects are introduced. New sounds are added for so many things, of especially good quality being the new weapon sound effects. It really is a wholesale improvement on what was already an amazing game. Here is a link to the mod:\n\nhttp://www.moddb.com/mods/payne-evolution\n\nI was surprised by just how much fun I had with the classic film-noir love story. The game holds up really well too in terms of aging. The revolutionary at the time physics and environmental interactivity is still really impressive. The level design is something else (it's really refreshing to have this big wide open level design to explore, in stark comparison to the heavily scripted nature of modern games) and the characterisation is strong. Like Max, you find yourself falling in love with Mona and hating Vlad just as much as he does. The dialogue is top-notch, with Max's brooding and dark outlook on life feeling a lot more original and fleshed out than Max Payne 3's lines. The comic book style presentation feels really unique too, a fine example of not so heavy-handed storytelling. The game at times made me miss some of the traits I associate with games in the days of yore, truth be told.\n\nThe original game's excellence is further enhanced with the the brilliance of the Payne Evolution mod. Hell, if anything can vindicate that then probably the best moment is when the mod maker took inspiration (well, blatantly copied really) the song for for the final sequence of Max Payne 3, which is incredibly haunting and well fitting, and added it to the final sequence of Max Payne 2. If anything, it fits even better.\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEH_LSL4rVw\n\nA real treat to revisit a game I fell in love with 11 years ago and still retains the quality I fondly remember.","July 9, 2014","true","16.5"," 22 of 29 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","22","29","0","2"

ITS EXCELENT. This must be one of the best games I ever playd in my entire life. It might not have the best graphics, but it sure have a very good, sad and dramatic story that makes you have so much feelings for the good and for the bad in the entire game. its sure short, I have to admit... the first game took me like 2 hrs to finish and the the second around 3 hrs... but together those were 5 hrs of being around drama all the time and just concentrate in getting closer and closer to figgur out who is Max Payne, his personality and his life story.... about the gameplay, ITS FREAKING AWESOME! The movement in this game, the skills of the main character and everything is just perfect. being abale to play with almost every kind of weapon you can think about and do some cool tricks with the character, one of them is just make the time slower and you can hear only your heart beats and bullets droping to the ground after you shot... which is very very cool! I dont think I can add anything else...

Funny, I don't remember there ever being a "Rise of Max Payne". These games are about a man who lost everything, there was never a rise...was there? Sometime in-between completing Max Payne 1 and the sequel, I finally watched John Woo's The Killer. While a classic in its own right due to the intense shoot-outs, I was especially impressed by its usage of tragedy. Ah Jong is an assassin, but he has morals and a sense of honor. Early on in the film, he accidentally blinds Jennie - a nightclub singer - during a hired hit. Thus, he takes on one last job. The reward would be used for Jennie's vision-saving operation. However, Jong is betrayed by his superiors.\n\n(SPOILERS)\n\nOver the course of the movie, Ah Jong befriends and eventually partners with Inspector Li Ying. Before the climatic battle, Jong asks Ying to promise that if/when he dies, his corneas be used to save Jennie's eyesight. So even if worst came to worst, Jennie could hopefully return to a normal life.  Unfortunately, in the last minutes of the movie, he's shot in the eyes by the villain. Before Jong succumbs to his wounds, he can hear Jennie's cries. Due to their blindness, neither of them can find one another, despite being just a few feet apart. Not only does Jong die, but his noble sacrifice is denied. Everything he worked (and killed) for over the course of the movie was for naught. Although Ying survives, he has lost good friends, and becomes disillusioned with the concept of justice.\n\nShortly after starting a new game in Max Payne 1, you're treated to the horrifying deaths of Max's wife and child. As time passes, he is framed for murder, wipes out half the criminal underworld, and develops an addiction to painkillers. However, if you've played through the game, then you can recall the final lines: "Woden grinned smugly. It was the grin of a winner. That made two of us." Max Payne is a winner. He succeeded in his mission of vengeance. For us, the audience, that's a satisfying end. So in its own way, Max Payne 1 chronicled the rise, so now we must witness the fall. Tragedy isn't just when a person dies, it's also when their hopes, dreams, and emotions are extinguished.\n\nAll that said, there is a lot of joy to be found in Max Payne 2. It's a twisted game, one that isn't afraid to poke fun at itself. This sense of humor keeps the game from coming off as overly dour. It feels especially rewarding to fans of the first title, because they'll pick up on all of the references. It's the kind of humor that fits the tone of the story. It's dark and depressing, but it also has a very distinct noir quality to it. Everything is interconnected, and you get the sense that Max might just be a small part of a much larger story. The "TV shows" that can be seen in various points of the game are a reflection of this. MP2 is a little shorter than its predecessor, but there's more imagery to absorb in every scene.\n\nAs for the actual videogame, I believe the combat mechanics are a marked improvement over the first entry. The concept hasn't changed much. You run through every level shooting all of the bad guys. Where this game differs is it showcases a bit more nuance, and a higher level of confidence. One of the first notable changes is that Max takes less damage. This brings it more in-line with the John Woo movies, where good guys shrug off bullets. A couple shot-gun blasts are still usually enough to bring Max from very healthy to dead, but occasional stray shots don't take large chunks of life either. This change gives Remedy a little more freedom when designing encounters. They're more involved, and there tends to be more memorable situations. Max Payne 1 was compelling enough even when combat was just "room full of thugs". The sequel changes things up, and it works very well. I don't even hate the escort missions, well...maybe I still hate them a little. These sections run parallel with some interesting and amusing ideas, so I guess I'll let them slide.\n\nWhile I'm not sure if I can attribute this to experience with the prequel, or actual changes, the "bullet-time" system also feels substantially better. When Max slows everything down, his heightened reflexes really come into their own. It's really fun running into an area, triggering the bullet-time, and wasting everyone. The first enemy is still flying through the air from Max's shotgun blast as he kills two more men in rapid succession. Occurences such as this are always welcome. Max also pulls off some sweet reloads while in bullet-time. One other minor but welcome change is that when diving and shooting, Max can continue firing while lying on the ground, until his clip is empty. This game uses Havok physics, but the enemies are properly weighted. This makes it so that kills carry some semblance of realism to them, but the few times where enemies soar, or get knocked around in massive explosions, are still very amusing.\n\nOn the surface, MP2 comes off as the easier game, but it's balanced out by more thoughtful encounters and harrowing situations. There's a bit more creativity to throw around, and hopefully it keeps players from hitting F5/F9 so much (no guarantees though). Unlike the first game, there is a distinct lack of "boss enemies" aka "thugs who take a lot more bullets to kill". I consider this another positive. Also, just when you really think you've got it down, there are still more difficulties and extra modes to explore. Don't forget to look for the minor details, like people complaining when you stand in-front of them, while they're trying to watch TV.\n\nBasically, if you played through the first Max Payne, you're required to check out the sequel. It's a phenomenal game, and features some of the best third-person shooting action around. The story is fantastic as well, and MP2's usage of various interactive elements really sells the "games-as-art" idea. Oh and don't forget the wide-screen fix.","October 26, 2015","true","6.6"," 16 of 22 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","16","22","0","0"

We are willing to suffer, to die for the things we care about. For love, for the right choices, Because of her, I had solved the case. My case. All of it.\n\nStory Two years after the events of the previous game, Max Payne is a NYPD detective. Senator Alfred Wooden has kept his promise, and released Max from his history of violence. Max got back to working for the NYPD to keep himself busy in life. After a series of events, Max investigates a group of contract killers called: The Cleaners. Mona Sax, who was presumed dead, is under investigation for killing Senator Gates, a member of "The Inner Circle" from the previous game. The leader of the Russian mob, and Max's old friend Vladimir Lem, finds himself in a heavy mob war with Vinnie Gognitti. Max is determined to find out about the unexpected return from Max's love interest Mona Sax, and who The Cleaners are working for, and what they want.\n\nGameplay Max Payne 2 plays very similar to its first installment. The new and polished bullet-time is back, and better than ever. The animations of the bullet-time just look better, and the bullet-time diving won't lower your stamina bar. The game has like its previous installment 3 parts, each with seven to nine chapters. Next to playing Max, you'll also play as Mona Sax for a few chapters, making the characters bond together even better. There are more guns to choose from, and are in my opinion far more fun to use.\n\nConclusion Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne is in my opinion a better game than Max Payne 1. It has one of the best game stories I've ever played, and it takes a few nice twists and turns. The gameplay is amazing and fun to play, and still plays a lot like Max Payne 1. That being said, the only bit of negativity I have for the game, is that it's really short. An average gamer completes the game in six or seven hours. But the story fits perfectly in this time span, nothing needs to be added or left out. But a little bit more time to walk around and shoot is never a bad thing. Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne is a phenomenal game, nothing more I can say about it.\n\n9.5/10","November 14, 2014","true","13.4"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

The gameplay isn't as awkward as before thanks to improved hitboxes and bullet trajectories, a sense of realism surrounds the game because of physics simulations like ragdoll effects, and the identity of the series has been given a new facelift thanks to higher production values. Overall, an excellent action game that's worthy of the Max Payne name and fans will be happy with this installment. However, if you're new to the series or have only played the Rockstar-made entry, you won't get as much from this game and everything will just look like a confusing mess. Max Payne 2 is a story-centric game and it builds on what fans and players of the first game already knows. This time around, the true intentions of the first game's major players are shown and reveals a new side to them, making them more believable rather than being a one-sided cliche of a character. The story focuses on Max after the events of the first title as he reflects on his past choices and how he copes up with the decisions that he's made. I highly suggest that new players play the first game or watch a recap video because without knowledge of the characters' background and the events leading up to this game, the story becomes much less impactful and you won't get much out of it because of its focus on the cast rather than plot.\n\n\nImprovements that I've noticed:\n1. Better voice actors than the first game and their performances are consistent except for some select moments.\n2. The new soundtrack is great, especially "Late Goodbye" by Poets of The Fall which is featured prominently in the game.\n3. Still linear but bigger levels with the inclusion of optional explorable rooms make it seem less so.\n4. Very serious story with comedic undertones. Sam Lake and Remedy somehow managed to make the virtual enemies that you're killing appear human in nature rather than just fodder that blocks your way. They laugh, they share jokes and share experiences with their friends, they also play the piano real good - very small details delivered in a very funny way but it still makes a lot of difference for the personal story that they're presenting to the player.\n\n\n\nAnd there you have it.","May 10","true","27.8"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

On the other hand you have the many who say that it's nothing more than hype and that at it's core Max Payne 2 is nothing more than an average shooter enticing the wannabe artsy gamers with a pseudo-deep story and pretty cinematic. You can never tell who's right in an argument like this, both sides will provide equal parts well-thought counterpoints and nonsensical fanatical rantings.\n\nMe, I really liked it. Sure the story is not as great as some proclaim but it's not the giant pile of lice infested feces that others call it. And yeah it's not 1930's French movie either but lets be honest, whether you like those kind of movies or not they'd never work as a game, the pacing is completely different.\n\nWhat saves the game for me is the simple fact that the gameplay is nice and solid. The shooting is fast and meaty and the slow motion gimmick that the original Max Payne brought forth to the masses still works well enough that it doesn't bother me as much as it does in other games. Now there is a mechanic that got overused in later games.\n\nThere is a reason Max Payne is a name many gamers know.

You follow the story of Max Payne, a former DEA agent for the New York City Police Department who has trouble keeping up with his life. You will need to fight trough loads of enemies using many available weapons and skills such as slow motion. The game features 3 difficulties; Detective - Enemies and health spawns adapt you, Hard Boiled - Enemies are harder and painkillers spawn rarely, Dead On Arrival - Same as Hard Boiled but with limited saves. There are also 2 bonus difficulties; New York Minute where you need to complete the level as fast as possible and Dead Man Walking where you fight enemies in arena until you die. The game takes around 8 hours to beat depending on what difficulty you took. I really recommend buying this game, you can get it for 2.49€ or for 2.99€ in a great Max Payne 1+2 pack on sale.\n\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/12150/\n═══════════════════════════════════PROS & CONS\nPros:Fun | You will want to replay this game sooner or later\nAwesome Game Mechanics | Side jumping and slow-mo make this game even better, the fact that you can do things actors do in one of those action movies makes me redo levels just so I can experience that again\nAddicting Soundtrack | This game has one of the best soundtracks, Main Theme is my personal favorite.Cons:Fullscreen doesn't work on Windows 7 and later | You can fix this by opening task manager, setting it to More Details, using a dropdown arrow on Max Payne process, selecting the process and using option Maximize. If that doesn't work Google is your friend.\nConfusing Story | I played the game few times and I still can't catch the story which really frustrates me.\nDumb AI | NPCs will often fail to do simple tasks or they will just run in gunfire by themselves═══════════════════════════════════SUMMARY & FINAL RATING\nThis game is for everyone that likes action shooters. I rate the game 8/10, would accidentally slow-mo myself from a building again!\n\n═══════════════════════════════════For more recommendations and reviews on our favourite up and coming quality games follow Lot's O Giveaway's group curations here!","December 11, 2015","true","1.6"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","7","9","0","0"

A Deserving Sequel to the Original!\n\nI reviewed the first game and I mentioned that due to the structure of the game it really doesn't age too badly. This title is the same, its aged like a fine whiskey and plays like a charm. The shooting is tighter, the locations are bigger and the bullet time is executed perfectly.\n\nThe story is strong, and this is key point. Remedy did a fantastic job with MP1 by creating a dark world of mystery burdened with mafia style shootouts, and this game really comes through and supports that by bringing back the characters and filling them out further.\n\nThe killer question, is it worth a purchase? Yes. Pick it up for less than £5 and you've got a steal. It came out in an era where single player games had to be long to do well, and although it picked up criticism for being too short, its a breath of fresh air compared to some current day releases.\n\nNotes\nNo Steam Achievements, No Trading Cards, No Controller Support.","December 27, 2013","true","16.5"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

This remains one of the best third person action games ever. The first one was also good but BRUTALLY difficult at points, and Max's hilariously constipated face made for great times, but part 2--pardon the pun--remedies whatever flaws the first one had. Aside from a graphical upgrade, they changed the bullet-time mechanics to basically be Cyborg 009's acceleration mode. As one of the first games to use Havok physics aka "♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ physics" in conjunction with ragdoll effects, the gunfights always looked and felt unique.\n\nThe other great thing about Max Payne 2 that hasn't really been explored since is the ongoing meta-narratives explored by overhearing radio broadcasts and television. A lot of it is referential to the first game, but several of the tales serve as "Shadow Play Girls" / "Tales of the Black Freighter"-esque parallels to existing developments.\n\nPS: beat it on Hardest and the ending's a bit different...","December 18, 2010","true","0.1"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Gameplay is improved a lot though, so it has that going for it, easier (you can take more damage) and ragdoll physics for the enemies make it much more playable and fun to play.\nStill only manual saves which like the first every so often leads to frustration.\n\n(also horrendous endboss battle, both for understanding what the game wants you to do and what you actually have to do, very unsatisfying)\n\nOverall I dont find it an all that great product: 7/10","March 12, 2014","true","6.8"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","5"

Thankfully I was wrong.\n\nOnce again you play Max Payne in probably his darkest time in his life. He is trying to deal with his grief of his dead wife and child, he is addicted to pills, and he is falling for a woman named Mona Sax. Life isn't the prettiest at the moment huh? I would go on, but truthfully I believe the less I tell about the story the better.\n\nEverything was made better in this sequel. The graphics are WAY better than the first. So much so that it still holds up pretty well today. The guns feel a lot better. Actually everything feels a lot better. It all feels a little heavier. The level design is even better and there is more variation to the game play. Like protecting a person you're escoting. It's not just all running and gunning. There is less ammo which is better. It keeps it challenging. In fact I would say Max Payne 2 is harder than the first.\n\nThe sotry is handled a lot better. The sound design is much better. The voice acting got a little better. The music is amazing. Everything seems to come together so well. I can easily say this game is on my top five shooters of all time.\n\nThis is totally worth a buy. Especially in the bundle. Please don't pass this game by. It's something that everyone who plays games should play through once.\n\n*Small spoiler*\n\nEven to this day the last line sits with me. It really flows very well with Max as a character and where everything goes.\n\n\n\n\n"I had a dream of my wife. She was dead.

Many times in MP1 you'll run around without any music in the background. MP2 not only offers more of it but also its soundtrack pretty much suits any situation perfectly, always. MP2 also changed Max Payne's theme slightly, in my opinion this is the best version of it.\n\nThe story this time is larger, epic. And its presentation is better than in MP1 if you can even believe that. The comics look much better with professional actors this time around, in MP1 Remedy had to work with what they've got, which I think you've noticed with many goofy looking faces which could be distracting in some parts.\n\nNow with bigger budget they have managed to create something truly amazing. Nothing seems weird or odd anymore, Max Payne's smirk also has been removed replaced with a ._. face .\n\nI promise you, you will get teary eyed or even cry at the ending. It is that powerful. Meanwhile MP1's story was about revenge, MP2 is about love. MP2 counties to also go deeper into Payne's psyche. Nightmares return and they're not frustrating as before, they are not as creepy, but their presentation is much superior.\n\n\n\nThroughout the game you can interact with your surroundings, watch TV shows which are still frames, true. But their stories are still strangely engaging or just interesting and it is fun to watch them. You've got ♥♥♥♥ Justice for example, a parody of MP1's story and Max Payne's character in general. Lords and Ladies, a parody of soap operas. There are much more of them and they're completely optional.\n\nGraphics looks really good, even today you'll have no problem with it, in that case this game has dated much better than the game that came before it. Except good models for the main characters and some good environment graphics all around.\n\nGunplay has been improved; oh it has been improved so much. Just the fact the game has radgolls now! It's so cool! You'll kill a dude and he'll fly away and then and then Max will do this cool spinning thing and the game follows it OH MY GOD IT'S SOO GOOOD!\n....Let me elaborate.\n\nBullet time and shoot-dodge return and there are slight tweaks to them.\n\nBullet-time now works in a slightly different way, when you start it up the bullet-time it doesn’t seem to slow down as much as it did in the MP1, that is until you kill an enemy. Each time you kill an enemy with Bullet-Time the game slows down more. And when you are forced to reload Max does this spinning move which looks really awesome and doesn't leave you to harm for so long, the move reloads your weapon very quickly.\n\nShoot-dodge has been unchanged for the most part, now the shoot-dodge just doesn't take any bullet time away from you, but you can get harmed and even die while you're performing it. You're no longer invincible as you were in the first game.\n\nThere are more weapons too and they all feel better to use.\nThe game's difficulty is much more balanced; there are no frustrating cheap deaths which you might have experienced in the first game.\n\nWhen you complete the game you get "Dead Man Walking mode" it's a mode where you are putted into a map from campaign, your quest is to stand and fight as long as you can until you die, you can try to beat your time-limit, it is quite fun and addicting and if you enjoy the gunplay as much as I do it's amazing.\n\n\nThe game is on a shorter side, shorter than the first game actually. But does that matter? The game's awesome!\n\n11/10, Better than best game ever made, buy it, buy it. Come on, do it.\n","June 11, 2014","true","53.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It´s a clever storytelling tactic, and provides an excuse for Max to bust out his witty one-liners and noirish remarks which are dotted throught the entire six-hour campaign, even if they do get a little stale at parts. Twists and turns lurk around every corner, making this is a story you     won´t want to put down until you see it through.\n\nGameplay hasn´t been drastically improved, which isn´t a bad thing if you were a fan of the original´s bullet-time setpieces and deadly shootouts, but some aspects could have been changed up a bit. One thing I noticed was a heavier use of dream sequences, which are there to provide a breath from the action and push the story forward, but ultimately only serve as boring, linear sections with little to no fun to be had at all. Perspective is also played with, as the focus sometimes shifts from Max to another character I won´t name so as not to spoil it. These chapters are very cleverly intersected with the    protagonist´s own path, and provide a different angle on some key events in the story.\n\nAn aspect of this sequel which has received a major overhaul is definitely the audiovisual department. The voice acting is once again top-notch, and the graphics have been redesigned to give Max and the supporting characters a more realistic feel, even though the thugs' faces do tend to repeat themselves far too often for their own good. Lighting effects add to the dark tone of the plot, making this title a beauty to look at.\n\nMax Payne 2 won´t blow you away with new mechanics, relying instead on the aspects that made the original the great experience that it was, but introducing some fantastic touches here and there which make it stand out as what a sequel should be: bigger and better. It´s not a very lengthy ride, but it´s definitely a sweet one.\n\nPros:\n\n+ Engaging and tightly crafted storyline that keeps you constantly guessing what´s about to happen\n+ Gorgeous looking graphics and animations\n+ Responsive controls which provide for an immersive experience\n+ Outstanding use of the bullet-time feature\n\nCons:\n\n- Short campaign\n- Seconday characters aren´t that detailed, and they tend to repeat their faces often\n- Corny dialogue\n- Annoying use of the quick-save option\n\nFinal grade: 8.5 (Very good)\n\n\n\n","June 25, 2014","true","6.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheGrayFoxx/recommended/12150/","TheGrayFoxx","Grand Master Obi-Wan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheGrayFoxx/","357 products in account","Max Payne 2 succeeds where it's predecessor did, telling a grim story through a comic-style setting. Once again, we see the dank world through the eyes of Max, being all too similar to this array of black and white, we are greeted with once again, New York. This game is grim, gruesome and most definietly dirty. And that's where Max Payne 2 shines, it's noir style story telling, it's emotional engagement with us as players, but most of all reach the titular character Max Payne to us on a personal level. It's hard to talk about how good the story is, without telling you the story of the first one (Although it's not mandatory to know the story of the first game) so avoiding spoilers in this review is hard to avoid, but rest assured, I will not spill any today.\n\nTechnically, this game is beautiful for it's time. Being ported around to multiple consoles, it's safe to say it's more powerful on the PC, and for good reason, it's developed by 3D realms co-insiding with Rockstar (Who went on to make Max Payne 3). The game play is smooth, the combat is clean, and the graphics are astonishing (In relation to it's time). There a few minor bugs here and there, especially on newer systems, since this game is not catered around for 64-Bit OS, or windows 7 at all (But they are various patches for that, I'd go and look at ancmilons patch guide on the Steam Forums).\n\nThe games major flaw is that it is far too similar to the first game, in terms of gameplay. I felt like I was just playing a B-Grade rip off of the original Max Payne. Fine, the game has been updated, the graphics are alot better, and the game is cleaner, but I didn't feel like I was doing anything new. It felt like it had a linear structure where I would go shoot some guys, and do the same again in differently designed room, and that's another point, the game was more linear than the original. There is not as much imaginiative level design to mess around the levels and explore, like in the Original. Although it sounds like i'm nit picking, this did reduce some points for me on a gamer level.\n\nIn conclusion, this game is a perfect sequel (Minus the repetiveness) and it follows on from the original story, in that all too similar dirty disgusting way, but unlike the original this has no replay value.","December 17, 2013","true","2.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

However, what little attention this game got or gets now, should prove nothing. Aboslutely one of my favorites. I first played the third one on my xbox (also another great game) and I didnt bother to really involve myself in the past games, but ever since I got this and the first for merely 3 dollars, I was happy. The story telling is amazing, gritty yet a bit of dark humor. The cutscenes are set in a slow pace, in the form of comic book pages, which may turn off people from buying this. However, the game moves so smoothly from gameplay to story, that this little feature shouldn't upset most. The gunplay is absolutely one of the best I've seen in a third person game, even in this day and age. What sticks out the most however, is the main character. Max Payne. Hands down one of the most interesting and best written protagonists out there. A cop turn vigilante, Max Payne is out for vengence for any who has crossed him in the past. Criminals have something to fear at night with Max Payne. His narration of the events taking place in the game is great, once again he keeps the pace up on this smooth shooter. Easily one of the best games I've ever played, and even though I'm a bandwagon fan for Rockstar, the fact that they published it has nothing to do with how great this game is.

For me, easily the best chapter in the whole franchise and maybe even one of the best games ever made.\n\nVery good level design and the overall atmosphere makes almost all of the levels memorable and unique - Mona's noir playground, dream sequences, cpt. Baseball-Bat escort mission, one mission from both Max and Mona's perspective to name some. The developers really put a lot of care to this game; the incredible amount of tiny little details (like usable world objects or bystander dialogues) shifts this from a video game to a consistent living piece of art. Only downside is that everything feels a tad too scripted - but I must add that it's scripted very well.\n\nThe game aged very well and didn't lose any of its shine throughout the years. If you're a bit computer-savvy then - after some small effort and googling - it WILL run on Windows 7 64-bit in widescreen no matter what some users are reporting.

The graphics and physics engine have been upgraded and polished which leads to very satisfying action gameplay. The game continues the bullet-time feature which leads to some awesome gunfights and allows you to land those precise headshots. The story is a good as ever and the story telling remains the same as a graphic novel. If you enjoyed the first game then you will enjoy the second game even more. The length of the story is about the same as the orignal game, around 7-8 hours - I wish the game was longer because it's just too good!","June 5","true","6.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Many people dislike it due to that but the game is still heavy with action-packed sequences, therefore, I believe there is no need to downgrade this one.\n\nMona, the girl Max encounters, becomes an essential part of the story and you can control her in a few levels. Max has not changed a lot - bullet time is still important and is very useful to complete the levels.\n\nThis game was a milestone in video gaming at that time - I believe it was one of the first games utilising the Havok engine; seeing how the eliminated enemies fall down and hitting objects was jaw dropping in 2004.\n\nI do not know why Valve did not upload more pictures or a couple of gameplay videos. You should check some on YouTube then you can easily make up your mind to pick this one up if it receives a discount. It certainly aged a lot so playing it after the 3rd episode might turn you away, still, I recommend giving it a try.","March 9, 2014","true","0.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I recommended that and the same apply's here.\n\nIn terms of change between the two games, I didn't really feel there was much. Bullet time is less about jumping while trying to shoot as many enemys as possible and more about triggering before entering a room and trying to clear the room before the bullet time's over. I have to admit I didn't really like the change, while fun in itself I always liked the more carefully planned approach of the original. The difficulty in general after how careful you had to be in the original was just a minor annoyance on what is otherwise a fantastic sequal.\n\nThis game stands the test of time nicely. You won't find it ugly or out of place with modern day games. The sound comes together just how you'd want it to, the game still contains that wonderful Max Payne theme.\nIt ran well on my fairly modern system (Windows 8 64bit, 1920x1080 resolution etc) You shouldn't have any problems here although there has been known to be issues with other players. (Check the forums first)\n\nI would have to finish by saying both Max Payne and Max Payne 2 are very similar, both are short experiences, both have fun, solid and replayable gameplay, wonderful soundtracks and great storys. I would fully recommend at the cheap price it sells at today.","December 29, 2014","true","5.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It is a huge improvement over the first Max Payne in nearly every way. One of my favorite, and most important, changes is that Max Payne himself no longer looks like he's smelling a rank fart. He looks like a human. The other characters also look like humans, rather than video game models wearing human faces. The bullet time is infinitely more useful as it replenishes faster and it gets a boost when you kill someone. The dodge-shooting also works better as it will let you keep firing from the ground, and doesn't immediately jump up and break the action until you stop firing.\n\nThe story is a lot more cohesive, and more interesting. It's not just a dude killing everyone in his way to get to the person who killed his wife and daughter. There are different motives and they change, and the characters change. The game is short as hell, but so was the first Max Payne, and with less frustration.\n\nMax Payne 2 is a better game than the original and, for all intents and purposes, you shouldn't feel compelled to play through the first Max Payne before you play this one. It is a truly great game.","November 25, 2013","true","8.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Unlike the first game, which is clearly a joke, it's possible to take this noir completely  seriously - and I recommend that you do. This game is a world that feels exactly as bad as you've ever felt, and I feel was the first game to ever really nail bullet time gameplay. Like any truly great film, it can be experienced again and again for new nuances and insights. I can't recommend this game highly enough.

I recommended that and the same apply's here.\n\nIn terms of change between the two games, I didn't really feel there was much. Bullet time is less about jumping while trying to shoot as many enemys as possible and more about triggering before entering a room and trying to clear the room before the bullet time's over. I have to admit I didn't really like the change, while fun in itself I always liked the more carefully planned approach of the original. The difficulty in general after how careful you had to be in the original was just a minor annoyance on what is otherwise a fantastic sequal.\n\nThis game stands the test of time nicely. You won't find it ugly or out of place with modern day games. The sound comes together just how you'd want it to, the game still contains that wonderful Max Payne theme.\nIt ran well on my fairly modern system (Windows 8 64bit, 1920x1080 resolution etc) You shouldn't have any problems here although there has been known to be issues with other players. (Check the forums first)\n\nI would have to finish by saying both Max Payne and Max Payne 2 are very similar, both are short experiences, both have fun, solid and replayable gameplay, wonderful soundtracks and great storys. I would fully recommend at the cheap price it sells at today.","December 29, 2014","true","5.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It still holds up surprisingly well for being an older game.  The gunplay feels good (with better hit detection than the original Max Payne), the graphics are improved, and it seems to take itself a little more seriously by dropping all the goofy cartoon faces that Max Payne would make in the original (there's even an audio clip in the game where they kind of make fun of themselves for doing that).\n\nThe same old comic-style noir cut scenes are still here and as good as ever.  The story seemed a little less interesting this time and was more about Max chasing Mona Sax around and shooting up all kinds of baddies in the process.  There's a tag team section where Mona covers Max with a sniper rifle while he traverses a construction yard that is probably the pinnacle of the game's ingenuity.  The "All Ghillied Up" mission in Call of Duty 4 gets a lot of praise for this idea but Max Payne 2 really thought of it first even if they didn't execute it quite as stylistically.\n\nLots of interesting locales though and the way you defeat the final boss was a means of thinking outside the box before it was cool to make games that think outside the box.","January 27","true","93.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Sam Lake is a god amongst video game writers. What it comes down to is Max's inner monologues that subdue the player into escaping reality and entering the stark world of Max Payne.\n\nTaking place two years after the events of the first masterpiece, Max Payne has been reinstated into the NYPD and is on the case of a group of hitmen that dress up as a cleaning crew. Max follows their trail while uncovering a conspiracy involving the Inner Circle, corrupt politicians, and dirty cops. Mona Sax reemerges early in the game, surviving her apparent death after getting shot in the head in the first one. She's on the run from the police but works with Max as they have similar goals.\n\nThe fall of Max Payne is that he falls in love with Mona Sax, he can't bring himself to turn her in or fight her; which makes the game a film noir love story (as stated on the iconic cover art).\n\nThe gameplay is very similar to the first one, why fix something that isn't broken, right? But the graphics are substantially better, Max's face doesn't look like a distorted Sam Lake and the models are certainly more polyganyl. The nightmare scenes are easier but still kinda crazy. And the music, the music is SO good. I would at times just pause the game and let the music play in the menu while getting some water or pop.\n\nOutstanding\n\n9.7/10","September 10, 2014","true","7.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Max is as appealing of a haunted protagonist as ever, and somehow even more badass in this one, and the overall story is pulpy, dramatic deliciousness for someone who eats up this kind of style.\n\nIt also has some impressive mod support!

Sam Lake is a god of videogame writing, and it shows here as plot twists and betrayals abound and leave you wondering if it ever really was black and white.\n\nThe gunplay is stellar, but special note must be given to the bullet-time and shootdodge mechanics of MP2. In MP1, you could only slow down time when you dodged, which was a good but flawed mechanic. In MP2, you can use bullettime without dodging (though shootdodge remains a viable option) and every kill you make while in the slowed timescale refills your bullettime meter a small function. If you're quick and skillful, you can keep it up for a long time.\n\nOverall, I'd recommend this game if you're a fan of noir, good storytelling, great gunplay and/or the first game.\n10/10 Bullets","October 11, 2012","true","14.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","1"

Disaster comparing to the first Max Payne.\n\nGraphics are ok and visuals overall are good. Music is alright and the sounds too. I like how they added a new addition to bullet time where if the player is continuously shooting while falling, he/she will remain on the ground untill he/she is finished shooting. Gameplay overall is good.\n\nStory is crap, lacks any depth, recycled material and typical old friend is now enemy BS. Little to NO CHALLENGE what so ever, you are spammed with ammo and health here and there. Hardest difficulty is a joke.\n\nIf you have ALOT of free time and a big fan of Max Payne 1, you can give this a go so you'll know how bad of a game this is and you didn't miss anything.

Build sites, endless apartment halls, streets and only by the end some sort of a palace with many awkward and glitchy moments.\n\nThe strongest sequences are the beggining one, another one with the Police HQ... and that's all I remember memorable. I never understood why Max Payne 2 was good because the romance was weak, the antagonist was a joke and... overall it's just like making Die Hard 2 after Die Hard 1.\n\nThe game might be worth it for one playthrough to see if you enjoy the new "autumn" setting contrary to the winter "Ragnarok" of the first game.\n\nIt attempts to show a relationship [Spoilers!!!]  revived  of the first game (and does so poorly in my opinion).\n\nIn fact, even the ending seems like a repetition of the first game's marvelous conclusion of an epic, whereas here - it seems as if I already played this somewhere... Stereotypes and old characters are back. Yet I would prefer them to remain in the dust as they unfolded, much, much more mysteriously and enigmatically in the previous game yet again.\n\n\nOnly for action fans.","March 21, 2014","false","8.0"," 7 of 40 people (18%) found this review helpful","18","7","40","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nabenheiser/recommended/12150/","nabenheiser","The Great Corporate Sellout","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nabenheiser/","316 products in account","I usually don't write reviews, much less a "not recommended" one, but this one has been eating at me a long time.  I know people generally read the first couple of lines and move on, but I wanted to do this, if only for me because I'm just another opinionated ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ on the internet.\n\nBefore I begin, let me clarify:\nMax Payne 1 was the best\nMax Payne 3 was alright, but not as good as MP1\nalso: SPOILER WARNINGS\n\nOkay, where to begin?  When I first played MP2, it was a Max Payne marathon session, so I had just finished the first game (again) and wanted to finish the second one (which I had not yet played) before I played Max Payne 3.\n\nNow, when people talk about the series, MP3 especially, they always mention how the story was mediocre especially when compared to the first two games.  Granted, it wasn't much, the lack of noire was sorely missed and when compared to the FIRST game, yes, it is particularly weak.  However, I am completely baffled when people say how good MP2's story was and how it was better than MP3.  No.  Just ... no.\n\nThe flimsy story for this game (spoiler warning) is simply thus:\nTake every character who didn't die in the first game and kill them off.\n\nThere you go.  That's it.  That's the whole 3-4 hour game right there, and the story abruptly ends when the bad guy, former "friend" Vlad who decides to kill you because they couldn't think of anybody else to do it and because he's Russian so why not, is killed.  The entire story, in a nutshell, is: "... and everybody died, the end."  If anything, this game is what paved the way for MP3 to have no connection to the first game's grim, atmosphereic noir setting simply by destroying any way to connect a third game to the first or second game.  And to anyone who wants to talk about how "gritty and noir" the story is, let me remind you that Vinnie Cogniti (or however it's spelled) puts on a ♥♥♥♥ing mascot outfit his arch rival gave him only to find out it's a bomb.  You're then tasked with saving his defenseless ♥♥♥ for a level so that in the next cutscene (an actual cutscene, not a graphic novel panel like in the first) he can get blown up anyway.  Whoop-dee-♥♥♥♥ing-doo.\n\nSo what do you do in this game?  Well, you run around and shoot people with a screwy version of bullet-time (when you activate it, time doesn't really slow down and only does the more people you kill, so if you've got a sliver of health and want to have those extra split seconds to take out a big group, like in the first game, you're in for a surprise.) occasionally triggering a graphic novel scene like in the first game, but those only come like once a CHAPTER.  And while in first game you could watch all those bits and it would tell a semi-cohesive story, in this they only come around long enough to say "HEY LOOK, SEE?  THIS IS JUST LIKE THE FIRST GAME!  LOOK AT THI-Oop, nevermind, it's over, back to game."  That's really all the noir is in this game: a coating, something to fool you into thinking it's a noir story like in the first.  Oh, and there's the really "FUN" bit where you have to protect someone whil using a sniper rifle, because trying to keep an NPC alive from a mile away is always great.\n\nIn the four or so hours it will take to beat the game, you'll get to do such things as watch cutscenes, kill guys with goofy ragdoll physics (which is actually pretty fun, don't get me wrong), go to the Ragnarok again (how original), visit the same Fun-House level three ♥♥♥♥ing times (with slightly changed layout) based on Valkyr V (see guys? this is just like the first game!) and along the way, Max will meet a variety of characters from the first game before they are subsequently killed as well as a paltry handful of new characters who get killed off to.  Oh, and if you played the first game, Mona (who got kinda killed but possibly wasn't killed or whatever) apparently survived and will be your love interest through the game until she dies at the end.  And as I said, the big bad guy is Vlad, who it turns out, in a huge case of the devs going "What things can we take from the first game and cram into here and retcon the ♥♥♥♥ out of, used to be in the same group as Alfred Woden, who he kills, then he kills Mona (she undied so she could re-die), then you kill him, then Max has a tiny necrophilia scene and then it just ends.  Max Payne accomplishes nothing, rescues no one, learns nothing except that people near him usually end up dead pretty fast (which I kinda thought was also part of MP1's story).  Oh, and if you thought the characters in MP3 were pretty unlikeable and had no connection to Max, then I re-invite you to play this game again and really take a good, long hard thought about it.\n\nIf you hated Max Payne 3's departure from noire and the things that made the first game so incredible, you can give a big round of applause to this game right here.  After playing it, there really isn't any ground left move forward from.  The only thing a sequel could have done is go far, far away from where the first two games took place and do something "fresh" with the franchise and, basically, just find some completely new ground to tread on.\n\nSo, in short, it's a functional game that goes nowhere, has no point, brings nothing new to the table and only does the "Noir" bit because it has to (and believe me, they only begrudgingly come out every now and again because it's in their contract claus) and, having never played it before, I beat it in a couple of hours in one sitting.  This game offers nothing and delivers nothing.  You're better off just playing the first game because that one actually is a good story, or if you really have to have ragdolls flopping around, get the third because of dem physics.","April 29, 2015","false","5.2"," 2 of 28 people (7%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","7","2","28","2","0"

However, what Max Payne goes through is as nothing when compared to what the average character has to go through during the course of any given Fallout game and you don't hear them whining about it so continuously. Look at what happens to Adam Jensen in Deus Ex: Human Revolution. Sure he complains but he does so nowhere near as much as Max Payne does. Remember all the crap that happened to Gordon Freeman from the Half Life games? Max Payne wouldn't have survived any of it because he would have been too busy feeling sorry for himself, wrapped up in his own melodrama. Sometimes Max Payne's attitude is funny but more often it just gets annoying.\n\nThis game's overdone, hard-boiled graphic novel style spoofs the original Max Payne's style except that game didn't even need spoofing. To make matters worse, the story feels disjointed and haphazardly slapped together. By today's standards the graphics have not aged well either as many of the environments now seem a little bland. The Lords and Lady's fake TV show is nice to see though and wandering around the police station was fun also. Overall though this third-person perspective action game is too linear and its plot is, to be frank, boring. The AI is good though (except for their terrible tendency to accidentally kill themselves with their own grenades). The ending feels a bit abrupt as well. The controls are good and the few bugs which occur are not too serious. The sound is excellent but only the menu theme song is any good and its merely a re-orchestrated version of the main theme from the first game. This game really should allow you to make choices which actually affect the plot (which would have made it much more fun and replayable) instead of forcing us to listen to the main character whine incessantly about how he doesn't have any choice and wax philosophical about moral-intellectual stuff of which he, and the game's developers and writers for that matter, clearly have absolutely no understanding. Worst of all (or perhaps best of all if you're sick of hearing Max Payne moan and groan) is that this is a very short game.","November 23, 2015","false","7.6"," 1 of 26 people (4%) found this review helpful","4","1","26","0","3"

The Max Payne series is the most overrated trash to ever grace the gaming landscape.\n\nWhy the ♥♥♥♥ did they even make a sequel?  To continue the "compelling" story of killing generic mafia goons?  So dark, so deep, so tense, the story of Max Payne is.  I don't even have to play this to tell you to avoid it at all costs.  The first problem with this game lies within the name itself, "The Fall of Max Payne."  Pardon me, but, isn't that the first game?  Must be fun to beat a dead horse.\n\nThe thing is, you are reading Max Payne 2 reviews because you enjoyed the first game and you want more.  This is where you ♥♥♥♥ed up.

The unique characters and excellent voice acting really stand out.  I believe the main storyline is not as strong as the first game but it’s interesting nonetheless.  Along with the story, the only minor problem is the games length, being about half that of the original title.

Everything, from the graphics to the storyline, all meshes into an almost perfect experience. The gunplay is satisfying, the story is intriguing, and the level design flows you from each combat scenario to the next. The story continues from where the first one left off, and while I recommend that you play that one first, I love that Max Payne 2 can stand alone as its own story, and I personally think that the story is better than the first. Along with the story, everything else is improved. The graphics are way better (The faces are much improved), bullet time is more useful because you move the same speed as everyone else moves slower, and guns have more heft, and if you can kill enemies in one hit if you get a headshot. Overall, I think Max Payne 2 is the perfect sequel; improving everything from the original while still keeping the spirit of the first one.\n10/10\n","January 3, 2015","true","5.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Released alongside titles such as Call of Duty, Beyond Good and Evil, and Knights of the Old Republic, Max Payne 2 suffered the same issue as Psychonauts: a great game with great reviews, although nobody bought it.\n\nThe gameplay and gun mechanics are only really comparable to the original Max Payne (another great game that has aged well), except they're much tighter and more refined. The infamous Bullet Time ability works quite well here, and the shoot-dodging mechanic is almost perfected. The weapons all work fairly well, although the pistols and shotguns become a little too situational to be practical at the end of the game.\n\nThe story itself is fairly cut and dry, although the Noir comicbook style of storytelling gives the game it's real charm. Unlike the first Max Payne, the comicbook segments are intercut with cutscenes which serve only to enhance the overall experience. The gameplay has enough variety to remain fairly fresh through its runtime, including pseudo-escort missions which don't actually suck.\n\nThe biggest criticism this game received was its short length, and, too be fair, that's not too far off the mark. In comparison to the original game, this one is certainly shorter, although this has the added benefit of substantial pacing. The environments are varied enough to be quite distinct (an attribute many modern games can't compare to), and the comparatively shorter length helps make this game an easy pill to swallow.\n\nTo anyone interested in the Max Payne series (and, if you like artistic games, well crafted single player storytelling, or fine-tuned slow-mo gun battles you should be), this is the crown jewel, although this game can be best appreciated after a playthrough of the original game for context and a better understanding of how this game's engine improved significantly in two years. The third installment, Max Payne 3, is certainly fun in its own right as well, although, with so many little things changed, altered, and tweaked, it simply doesn't give as good of an appreciation of the Max Payne franchise that this game can provide.","September 2, 2014","true","7.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is way easier (and more enjoyable for me) than the first Max Payne due mostly to your bullet time meter now increasing on it's own when it goes down, and it also lasts longer when you have it activated.\n\nStorywise this wraps up all the loose ends left over from the first game and even gives Max a slight bit of hope or peace at the end. There is far more time given to explore Max and Mona Sax's relationship in this, and you even get to play as her during one section of the game, which was a cool feature, you get to see some of the story play out from her point of view while you replay a level you originally did as Max but in a different area of it, so it's not repetitive.\n\nThere are still dream sequences in this but they aren't the same torturous "try to puzzle your way through walking on this thin line of blood to your crying dead baby" as the first one, although one later dream does have a small puzzle. The ambient audio is way better as well, instead of hearing a dead baby screeching, you get to listen to what sounds like Mona Sax having an orgazm, which given the choice i think i would choose listening to that every time (go figure).\n\nThe game is short (4 to 5 hours) but leaves you wanting more, and i never noticed this before but right at the end of the credits it has a james bondish "Max Payne will return from the night" or something, im paraphrasing it but that was neat to see, too bad it took them 9 years to make another one due to lacklustre sales, and it wasn't Remedy when they did but Rockstar.\n\nHas the same issues on win7 as the first game (see my first Max Payne review)\n\nIf you haven't played this you should all take a trip with Max and Mona into the night and give them a late goodbye.","March 4, 2015","true","6.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

They don't. Quite honestly this game is inferior to the original, for a number of reasons. The first thing is that the story is basic as all get out. It still keeps the excellent film noire themes and style from the first game, but it doesn't grab you as much as the original did. I found myself caring for all of the characters, but I felt that at the same time, I didn't care if they died or not. There was an exception though. The love plot between Max and Mona was delivered well, though Mona's role wasn't executed well. As far as gameplay goes it was just as good as in the first, though not better. Now we can use bullet time two different ways, which as far as I can tell was a completely useless concept, as I stuck with one the entire game. Levels are just as good as in the first game, but the dream sequences put in to replace the Valkyer levels in the first game aren't up to par.\n\nFinal Verdict: 7/10\n\nIt was fun to continue the tale of Max Payne, but this game feels like a afterthought.

Call of Duty has shown us that when you want to kill Russians, you send a good AMERICAN citizen like RAMIREZ in, not some cop with a bad hair cut like Max Pain.

Released alongside titles such as Call of Duty, Beyond Good and Evil, and Knights of the Old Republic, Max Payne 2 suffered the same issue as Psychonauts: a great game with great reviews, although nobody bought it.\n\nThe gameplay and gun mechanics are only really comparable to the original Max Payne (another great game that has aged well), except they're much tighter and more refined. The infamous Bullet Time ability works quite well here, and the shoot-dodging mechanic is almost perfected. The weapons all work fairly well, although the pistols and shotguns become a little too situational to be practical at the end of the game.\n\nThe story itself is fairly cut and dry, although the Noir comicbook style of storytelling gives the game it's real charm. Unlike the first Max Payne, the comicbook segments are intercut with cutscenes which serve only to enhance the overall experience. The gameplay has enough variety to remain fairly fresh through its runtime, including pseudo-escort missions which don't actually suck.\n\nThe biggest criticism this game received was its short length, and, too be fair, that's not too far off the mark. In comparison to the original game, this one is certainly shorter, although this has the added benefit of substantial pacing. The environments are varied enough to be quite distinct (an attribute many modern games can't compare to), and the comparatively shorter length helps make this game an easy pill to swallow.\n\nTo anyone interested in the Max Payne series (and, if you like artistic games, well crafted single player storytelling, or fine-tuned slow-mo gun battles you should be), this is the crown jewel, although this game can be best appreciated after a playthrough of the original game for context and a better understanding of how this game's engine improved significantly in two years. The third installment, Max Payne 3, is certainly fun in its own right as well, although, with so many little things changed, altered, and tweaked, it simply doesn't give as good of an appreciation of the Max Payne franchise that this game can provide.","September 2, 2014","true","7.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Very good story, good graphics and physics (they have aged a little bit), and good game/level design. I highly recommend this game, but only if you've played Max Payne 1 (which introduced Bullet Time to video games) as the story in this game is a direct continuation. The ending is also badass, Max Payne endings are always very cool. The selection of weapons you have in this game are actually more limited in variety than in the prequel, there are no melee weapons and the M79 grenade launcher is gone from the original game. However, new weapons have been introduced to make up for this. These include the MP5, AK-47, M4 Carbine, Striker (obviously based on the real life DAO-12), and the Dragunov. Bullet Time and its role has been expanded upon. You can now reload weapons while in bullet time, via a stylish spin maneuver, and shootdodging no longer requires Adrenaline. In terms of replayability, there really isn't much. I still like to go back and replay Max Payne games sometimes, but that's just me. There is a new arcade mode called "Dead Man Walking," but all it is about is surviving for as long as possible in small maps and trying to beat your score from last time. No multiplayer unfortunately. So to reiterate, Max Payne 2 is definitely worth your time, but only if you've played Max Payne 1 and you're fine with a game with little replay value (if you're not like me).","November 5, 2015","true","6.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In just 2 years Remedy was able to make a sequel that made the combat even more engaging, have the dream sequences feel even more ominous, have more depth into it's main character and have some great development in-general. The atmosphere of the world is so thick you can shoot bullets through it. This game also acts as a staple of "past generation game design" with some solutions to problems being left for you to figure it out and some non-linear paths to events of the gameplay just from the player mucking about or listening to NPCs. One moment has Payne going through an apartment complex with a couple civillians that can tag along with you, helping you out in gunfights and even giving you cover when you reach a certain point. Or you can simply shoot them right away, there's no penalty for it. As long as you have a gun in your had at the time you can shoot anyone and everyone you like.\nThere's simple touches to the gameplay that don't do much other than making Payne look even cooler (slo-mo reloading). Another one of these is TV, yes you can just sit back (stand) and watch some telly. Being honest, I spent 10 minutes watching different things on the TV until it started repeating, damn. One of the things on the TV leads into the great and not very obvious or in your face symbolism. 2 of the recurring shows on the TV give some nice symbolism to the events of the story at the moment that you watch it, or into Payne's own mindset. Sometimes even teasing future events yet to happen. And by the last level you can watch both series finale's. It's this great dream-like state that the game has that I particularly loved and that the games use to great effect. There's some nice cameo's that, if you're paying attention, you'll notice right away as well. A few points give you control of a second character for story purposes, and it's a little weird when you discover that she has the same bullet-time abilities as Payne.\nJust like the last one, Max's VA is just brilliant at his lines. While everyone else is either "eergh", okay or inconsistant with  their performance. Unlike the last one the game works like a charm, with absolutely no bugs or technical problems. By the end the game's world feels just as lonely and cold as Payne is feeling from what's happened during the game, the way the story unravels is great and some moment are pretty heavy *-*. Unfortuately it doesn't have the visual scope of the original and a lot of the locations you are in are just the same places you were in the last game. There are a couple great set pieces though that allow opportunities for the level design to be more creative and one being a theme park of sorts for one of the TV shows in the game, which is mainly for the psychological themes to kick in. But that unfortunately get old by the 2nd and 3rd visit there. You should already be playing/ have finished this if you enjoyed the first one, and the ending gives some great mystery to where Max's life is going to head to next. I ONLY wish it was longer.\n9/10 :)","November 14, 2015","true","34.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

May Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne is definitely one of them. I'd say it's the last of the good old games. Max Payne 2 is a strange specimen because it's between two periods, the old and the new. It has the charm of oldschool games while feeling modern and polished. The action is one of the best I've ever seen. The gameplay feels very cinematic, inspired by John Woo's motion pictures. But the best thing they've introduced since the first Max Payne is the physics engine. Enemies fall spectacularly when they die, especially in slow motion, and you can even jump into them and drive them to the floor.\n\nThe visual novel style cutscenes are back from the first game along with the heavy noir atmosphere. This time I fell like they've put a bit more emphasis on the detective aspects of the story which I personally love, and it's still every bit as thrilling as the first game (if not more). The music is great and strengthens the tension in the atmosphere, but the guns sound a little off to me. The main problem with the game is that it's too short in my opinion, but with the challenge modes making a return, and given the exquisite gameplay, I think you'll find yourself playing this game over and over again.\n\nI can't recommend this enough.

It depicts a broken Max seeking redemption and he gets this through the game's other main character, a femme fatale known as Mona Sax.\n\nStory: The game is basically a tragic love story between Max Payne and Mona Sax. Over the course of the game, Mona Sax is constantly on the run (for reasons you will find out in the game) and Max Payne, now an NYPD cop must pursue her. The more Max encounters Mona, the more he becomes infatuated with her and this creates an interesting dynamic between them. The story is well-told and interesting but not as poetic and dark as the original Max Payne.\n\nGraphics: I can't say much about the graphics given that it came out more than 10 years ago (in 2003). What I can say that the visuals are still servicable and okay for today's standards and I would imagine that the graphics at the time were ground-breaking. Not so much nowadays.\n\nGameplay: The movement, gunplay and overall responsiveness in MP2 is much improved over Max Payne 1. Now you can equip an item like a grenade to another button, instead of needing to switch to it. Bullet time is back and it feels as good as ever. It is a lot of fun to activate Bullet Time and take out 3 to 4 enemies , and this really makes you feel like a badass. There is much less frustration to the controls this time round.\n\nOverall, Max Payne 2 is a great action game that I believe has stood the test of time and is still better than some action games of today.\n\nI'd give the game an 8.5/10.","June 22, 2015","true","6.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The film noir style is fantastic, the music is perfect, the graphic novels bits are downright gorgeous, the combat system is fluent and intuitive (even though the game is a bit difficult - but still easier than Max Payne 1) and the story is beautifully dark and sad (an honorable mention goes to the dream sequences - the style and content of those is really poetic and memorable; a strong point of the original Max Payne that they have definitely improved on). It's organised like a classic three act drama and also feels like it. The story also holds some unexpected turns, that are sure to surprise you - and if you don't feel a bit melancholic when the end credits roll, you are messed up. One last thing though: if you look into trying this gem yourself, mak sure to pick up Max Payne 1 first. It justs makes the story much more complete (despite the fact that the game offers a "previously on Max Payne" option).","July 16, 2012","true","6.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I instantly wanted a go, and thusly my love for the franchise was born.  I died a lot, and never got past the second level.\nGood times!\n\nThat was a long time ago, and I no longer suck at Max Payne. As much.\nThe thing that really hits you about this game (rather like the shotgun pellets fired at Max) is the learning curve it requires. The first levels see an insomniac Max exchanging small arms fire with members of a cleaning company, but it quickly escalates into tense massacres featuring you versus the entire mafia. Don't worry, you might be ready for it!\n\nI won't ruin the storyline here, but it's bleak, absolutely beautiful and it inter-twines with the brilliant mechanics of the game well. No one can possibly dislike bullet-time diving around a corner as you dodge in between huge amounts of ordnance being flung your way by dangerously good enemies.\n\nYou will die, you will get stuck. But as long as you don't mind chugging pain killers like mentos, re-loading every chance you get and aiming for the head, you'll be fine and have a great time.\n\nIn my mind this game is one of Rockstar's best, darkest creations that deserves a special place in the heart of all gamers.\n\nOh, and remember: The duel Ingrams are an absolute show stopper.\n\nRecommended for those who love to delve deep into a story and who are looking for an original experiance!","August 29, 2013","true","2.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And in the middle of it all, Max Payne is trapped, still madly running from his past and his memories, and desiring death, finds instead a reason to live again.

I played through this game straight from 7 PM to 4 AM without stopping to do anything. It's very immersive and utterly compelling. If I had played this back in 2003 my mind would have been blown. Literally. Like, it seriously might've been a medical emergency. The graphics are outstanding for a 2003 title and the cinematic action is very well executed, it featured a romance-themed plot that wasn't (and really still isn't) seen often in video games. Remedy is just a fine developer in general, they put a lot of detail into their games both plot and design wise. If you like this game I recommend playing Alan Wake (same developer), it's very similiar in many ways though horror-themed instead of action-romance.\n\nTL;DR: Probably the only game I've ever been compelled to finish in one sitting.

The film noir style is fantastic, the music is perfect, the graphic novels bits are downright gorgeous, the combat system is fluent and intuitive (even though the game is a bit difficult - but still easier than Max Payne 1) and the story is beautifully dark and sad (an honorable mention goes to the dream sequences - the style and content of those is really poetic and memorable; a strong point of the original Max Payne that they have definitely improved on). It's organised like a classic three act drama and also feels like it. The story also holds some unexpected turns, that are sure to surprise you - and if you don't feel a bit melancholic when the end credits roll, you are messed up. One last thing though: if you look into trying this gem yourself, mak sure to pick up Max Payne 1 first.

Now I don’t usually do that unless the game is either incredibly fun or has one really good engaging story. Max Payne 2 does both.\n\nMax Payne is a former DEA agent for the NYPD and a fugitive framed for the murder of his partner and friend Alex Balder and it tormented by the loss of his wife and daughter. Max Payne is such a likable character and is one of gaming best Anti-heroes and Badasses. Max takes no ♥♥♥♥ and will do anything to solve his case, all while having this minor Painkiller addiction. Max Payne is voiced by James McCaffery who has one the greatest deep and grizzled voices ever. The way he delivers his lines is perfect. Max also has some the best dialogue ever in a game with such quotes as “It was colder than the devil's heart, raining ice pitchforks as if the heavens were ready to fall” and “Fraternizing with the enemy. I had stepped over the edge. The cartoon moment when the gravity waits for the coyote to realize his mistake before the plunge.”\n\nMax Payne 2’s gameplay is just awesome. Satisfying gunplay, challenging A.I and of course the ♥♥♥♥ing awesome SLOW-MO DIVING!! Which never ever gets old. The gameplay along with how the games story is told will make you not want to stop playing. Well at least it did for me. The story is told on the fly with Max narrating what he is doing and what is going on and it is also told by these fantastically stylised Comic Film Noir Cut scenes. The story like the cover of the games says, I a film Noir love story between Max and mysterious contract killer Mona Sax and their tale is a great one.\n\nMax Payne 2 is seriously enjoyable and you might have noticed I did not really mention the story at all. That is because I want you to experience it the same way I did. Brilliant story and characters and fantastic gameplay makes Max Payne 2 one of the most enjoyable games I have played in a while. The only short coming I have about it is that it is kind off short. 4-5 hours but personally if it was any longer it would’ve out stayed its welcome since it is perfectly paced.\n\nIt completely ♥♥♥♥♥ on Max Payne 3.

Just like the first one, its strongest point is the lead man and his story. The way the character develops in this series is surely one of the most fascinating aspects of the game, at least for me. Now, storyline aside, the second Max Payne felt a little underwhelming for me because it was much easier than the first one. I have only played on the default mode (which is Detective IIRC) and it still felt much easier to beat than its counterpart. On the same line, it was very very short, a lot shorter than the first one, and even though it was action-packed and very entartaining, it took me only 9.5 hours to beat it. Anyway, when it comes to gameplay, it is a clear improvement compaired to the first MP. The bullet-time is more efficient and feels a lot better - on the downside, it makes things too easy (again), so I've realized I've gone thru 80% of the game without even using it, which says a lot since there are angry thugs wanting to kill you at every corner. But, surely, the gameplay feels more smooth and it has some new cool little things (like being able to carry both handguns and hand-thrown weapons).\nSo, tl;dr: storyline (+ bonus points for character development) - 8/10; gameplay - 7/10; overall - 7.5/10 'twas fun.","February 3, 2014","true","9.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I played through this game straight from 7 PM to 4 AM without stopping to do anything. It's very immersive and utterly compelling. If I had played this back in 2003 my mind would have been blown. Literally. Like, it seriously might've been a medical emergency. The graphics are outstanding for a 2003 title and the cinematic action is very well executed, it featured a romance-themed plot that wasn't (and really still isn't) seen often in video games. Remedy is just a fine developer in general, they put a lot of detail into their games both plot and design wise. If you like this game I recommend playing Alan Wake (same developer), it's very similiar in many ways though horror-themed instead of action-romance.\n\nTL;DR: Probably the only game I've ever been compelled to finish in one sitting.

The slightly improved graphics and ability to play as a different character in some sections add to the experience. It maintains the gritty neo-noir style of MP1 (with more of a romance this time), minus the f*cked up nightmare drug sequences. There are still moments of delirium but they are noticeably less disturbing (no vertigo corridoors with murdered infant screams echoing around you). This game appears to be set a few years after the first, the more aged Max now resembles Bryan Ferry in a leather coat mowing down gangsters with a large arsenal of weapons. As in the first game the graphic novel storyboard style of cutscenes is a really good idea for advancing the story. Admittedly this does feel like a bit of a retread without any serious expansion, but anyone who played the first one will know how well the formula worked, as is likely to enjoy it just as much.

I instantly wanted a go, and thusly my love for the franchise was born.  I died a lot, and never got past the second level.\nGood times!\n\nThat was a long time ago, and I no longer suck at Max Payne. As much.\nThe thing that really hits you about this game (rather like the shotgun pellets fired at Max) is the learning curve it requires. The first levels see an insomniac Max exchanging small arms fire with members of a cleaning company, but it quickly escalates into tense massacres featuring you versus the entire mafia. Don't worry, you might be ready for it!\n\nI won't ruin the storyline here, but it's bleak, absolutely beautiful and it inter-twines with the brilliant mechanics of the game well. No one can possibly dislike bullet-time diving around a corner as you dodge in between huge amounts of ordnance being flung your way by dangerously good enemies.\n\nYou will die, you will get stuck. But as long as you don't mind chugging pain killers like mentos, re-loading every chance you get and aiming for the head, you'll be fine and have a great time.\n\nIn my mind this game is one of Rockstar's best, darkest creations that deserves a special place in the heart of all gamers.\n\nOh, and remember: The duel Ingrams are an absolute show stopper.\n\nRecommended for those who love to delve deep into a story and who are looking for an original experiance!","August 29, 2013","true","2.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The story is a very engaging loose cannon detective, revenge/redemption, film noir style presented mostly through monologe and comic strip style cutscenes. The writing is cheesy as all hell, but in an endearing way fans of the genera will instantly feel at home playing. Even through there is a recap of the events of the last game, you'll definitely want to pick up the first game as well to get the whole picture. The gameplay is far tighter than the first game, partially due to refined controls, partially due to better level design and an overall more forgiving game. The shooting plays out like a John Woo movie with people diving back and forth, switching in and out of slow motion... It's simply exhilerating. The graphics, music and art style all hold up well after all of these years, but nothing really stands out anymore. Bottom line: If you enjoy film noir or old school shooters, I'd definitely give the first two games in the series a shot.","December 10, 2013","true","6.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Everything, from the graphics to the storyline, all meshes into an almost perfect experience. The gunplay is satisfying, the story is intriguing, and the level design flows you from each combat scenario to the next. The story continues from where the first one left off, and while I recommend that you play that one first, I love that Max Payne 2 can stand alone as its own story, and I personally think that the story is better than the first. Along with the story, everything else is improved. The graphics are way better (The faces are much improved), bullet time is more useful because you move the same speed as everyone else moves slower, and guns have more heft, and if you can kill enemies in one hit if you get a headshot. Overall, I think Max Payne 2 is the perfect sequel; improving everything from the original while still keeping the spirit of the first one.\n10/10\n","January 3, 2015","true","5.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The story is a very engaging loose cannon detective, revenge/redemption, film noir style presented mostly through monologe and comic strip style cutscenes. The writing is cheesy as all hell, but in an endearing way fans of the genera will instantly feel at home playing. Even through there is a recap of the events of the last game, you'll definitely want to pick up the first game as well to get the whole picture. The gameplay is far tighter than the first game, partially due to refined controls, partially due to better level design and an overall more forgiving game. The shooting plays out like a John Woo movie with people diving back and forth, switching in and out of slow motion... It's simply exhilerating. The graphics, music and art style all hold up well after all of these years, but nothing really stands out anymore. Bottom line: If you enjoy film noir or old school shooters, I'd definitely give the first two games in the series a shot.","December 10, 2013","true","6.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Let's face it how many game sequals can claim this? Not many. The story, as in the original game, is progressed by some excellent graphic novel style cut scenes. The voice acting is again spot on. You are again inside Max's head. The combat ans gunplay in Max Payne 2 is outstanding, insane at times, the bullet time is extremely fun to play with, Max' dive is great for showing off and the bullet time reload is just .perfect. It's great because you'll be able to use these skills in several of different locations and scenarios. This brings us to another amazing element of the game. The level design is superb, there's a diverse range of atmospheres in which differ by a lot. Whether it's in a building, construction site or with blazing infernos beside you, the combat approach would most likely be different.\n\nJust, if you haven't already played Max Payne 2 already, just go and look very hard for it, this game is one of the old school titles which you would regret missing.

This is way easier (and more enjoyable for me) than the first Max Payne due mostly to your bullet time meter now increasing on it's own when it goes down, and it also lasts longer when you have it activated.\n\nStorywise this wraps up all the loose ends left over from the first game and even gives Max a slight bit of hope or peace at the end. There is far more time given to explore Max and Mona Sax's relationship in this, and you even get to play as her during one section of the game, which was a cool feature, you get to see some of the story play out from her point of view while you replay a level you originally did as Max but in a different area of it, so it's not repetitive.\n\nThere are still dream sequences in this but they aren't the same torturous "try to puzzle your way through walking on this thin line of blood to your crying dead baby" as the first one, although one later dream does have a small puzzle. The ambient audio is way better as well, instead of hearing a dead baby screeching, you get to listen to what sounds like Mona Sax having an orgazm, which given the choice i think i would choose listening to that every time (go figure).\n\nThe game is short (4 to 5 hours) but leaves you wanting more, and i never noticed this before but right at the end of the credits it has a james bondish "Max Payne will return from the night" or something, im paraphrasing it but that was neat to see, too bad it took them 9 years to make another one due to lacklustre sales, and it wasn't Remedy when they did but Rockstar.\n\nHas the same issues on win7 as the first game (see my first Max Payne review)\n\nIf you haven't played this you should all take a trip with Max and Mona into the night and give them a late goodbye.","March 4, 2015","true","6.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But on more modern PC's the game needs extra work to get running, i'll give instructions at the end of the review. Once you do get the game running you won't wanna stop playing, in my opinion it tells a much better story than the original did and has exellent level design much like the first installment. They kept the fast shooting gameplay of the original Max Payne and the unique comic book cut scenes from the original make a return which is awesome to see. But like I said you need to do a little extra work to get it running which sucks and to some people it may not be big enough of a change to keep it interesting but in the end the game is well worth the purchase price and a great sequal to a great game, I give Max Payne 2 a 9/10.\n\nOkay to get the game running on newer PC's you need to go to msconfig, to get there on Windows 8.1 you should first hold down the windows button usually found on most keyboards on the left side and then hold the R key until a program simply known as Run pops up. Once you complete that step you can simpy type msconfig and and from there enter the program. Once your in head to the boot tab and enter advanced options, then check the box that says number of processors and put it to 1 by clicking it in the box below, then you hit OK and apply and then OK again to exit msconfig. Then it will ask for you to restart your PC to limit the processor usage to 1. To get all of your processing power back in use go back to msconfig and uncheck the the number of processor usage box go through wth OK and apply and restart. Now after all that you can play Max Payne 2: The fall of Max Payne on your Windows 8.1 PC.","August 6, 2015","true","0.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Very good story, good graphics and physics (they have aged a little bit), and good game/level design. I highly recommend this game, but only if you've played Max Payne 1 (which introduced Bullet Time to video games) as the story in this game is a direct continuation. The ending is also badass, Max Payne endings are always very cool. The selection of weapons you have in this game are actually more limited in variety than in the prequel, there are no melee weapons and the M79 grenade launcher is gone from the original game. However, new weapons have been introduced to make up for this. These include the MP5, AK-47, M4 Carbine, Striker (obviously based on the real life DAO-12), and the Dragunov. Bullet Time and its role has been expanded upon. You can now reload weapons while in bullet time, via a stylish spin maneuver, and shootdodging no longer requires Adrenaline. In terms of replayability, there really isn't much. I still like to go back and replay Max Payne games sometimes, but that's just me. There is a new arcade mode called "Dead Man Walking," but all it is about is surviving for as long as possible in small maps and trying to beat your score from last time. No multiplayer unfortunately. So to reiterate, Max Payne 2 is definitely worth your time, but only if you've played Max Payne 1 and you're fine with a game with little replay value (if you're not like me).","November 5, 2015","true","6.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The Music as well was great over the first one capturing the tone more through more instruments and melody's in them, with my favorite song being the main theme so much so that whenever someone says "Max Payne" its the song that comes into my head : https://youtu.be/u116HbMOF_Y and especially  https://youtu.be/8KuFmGxMcZI\n\nThe game-play improved on 1's largely feeling more satisfying as it felt like you could really land a head-shot successfully and this game probably had the best Bullet Time Mechanics of the whole series.\n\nYet while the game-play improved instead of having a weaker story like in 3 we still got the clever and brilliant writing and setups of Sam Lake and the graphic novel cut-scenes were even better with detail behind them and genuinely very well done so that means that 2 has the better game-play with the series moving on and yet the brilliant writing of the first, so whats the problem? One problem and one problem only : the length.\n\nThis is a very short game around 4-6 hours especially if you are already familiar with the gameplay but usually thats not an issue with me if a game is enjoyable enough like say Uncharted then its fine as its own little adventure. The problem for MP2 is that its meant to act as a mental journey and a true analysis of a broken mind struggling to keep up with the world but because of the shorter length its has to rush scenes and it can feel incomplete in that sense like their are chances for the game to go on and deepen itself with yet it dosent. Say what you want about 3 but its story felt rounded off after a large journey while MP2 kinda goes through the motions with not that much happening in it even though the setups are still there and the writing is still great.\n\nEven though the length is a issue and this the weakest one of the trio its still a great game none-the-less and one that's absolutely worth a shot if you loved the first one.\n\nBonus : Also so you arent lost when trying to get it to work  like i was : https://steamcommunity.com/app/12150/discussions/0/828937979068499775/?l=english\n\nBut also a mod that i want to bring attention to is the "Payne Evolution", where the game is given a MP3 style to it while still retaining the story of 2 as it has an arcade mode, bonus fan made storys and basically alters the gameplay to that similar of Max Payne 3 and its a really great mod to check out with a lot of extra content there to add onto the main game itself adding another few hours of fun to have with 2 if youre not coming back to play it again.\nMod : http://www.moddb.com/mods/payne-evolution\n\n8/10 (8.5/10 With Payne Evolution mod as well otherwise)","February 20","true","12.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Pretty much everyone is back from the original Max Payne and we get to see the aftermath of bringing Aesir Corp. down along with Horne, it has been two years according to the wiki. This time around there are 2 main protagonists that you control which offers some interesting segments of teamwork from the two characters to get through seemingly grave situations.\nThe gameplay is pretty much the same with a few tweaks and upgrades making for an even smoother experience this time around. When Max dives you can now continue to stay laying down until you let the trigger go which is definitely a welcome addition. There are definitely more painkillers to be found in Max Payne 2 as well which is fine because it is definitely a challenge at some points. All around this is a proper sequel to a cult classic expanding on the world of Max Payne and you should definitely play through the whole trilogy.\n\nAs a note, the game will take some tweaking to get working as you would like and there are some cool mods like the Max Payne 3 mod which I may try in my next playthrough.\n\n"But I refused to give in.

Nothing","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198053588824/","11 products in account","Just two years after the first Max Payne (2001) was released, Remedy came up with their second creation of the series, Max Payne 2 (2003). This time they developed a game which had a whole lot of better graphics, upgraded game mechanics, more interesting level design, a bunch of new guns and an enhanced level of voice acting as well as an enhancend level of enemy AI.\n\nAnyhow, like it's predecessor, Max Payne 2 is also quite a fast-paced game. The guns introduced in the game have a good feel on them and while bullet time or shoot dodge is being used at the same time, it will double the enjoyment. Also, the enemies are not able to take ridiculous amount of bullets before they die anymore, which is a huge improvement on its own over the first Max Payne game. The gradually slowing bullet time is an awesome invention as it is easier for the player to handle big amount of opponents at the same time. The controllabilty of Max's moves is still going strong, the level of voice acting is great and because there is some improvements on the enemy AI, Max Payne 2 is a very enjoyable game at its best.\n\nNow, not only the game mechanics has been proven to be better in Max Payne 2 than they are in Max Payne 1, but also the graphics have taken a big leap forward. Overall the environmental texturing have gotten to a higher level. Max can see his own reflection and the faces seen in the game are more natural than they used to be in the previous Max Payne game. The cars are a bit more than just boxes on the wheels and the whole level design is much more interesting.\n\nDespite all the enhancements, the game is still all about running and shooting with no considerable variation between the firefights you encounter. The overall amount of usable guns is still quite low and the game will not last too long, as an average person who is playing the game through for the first time can beat the game in about 5 hours. Additional game modes seem to be quite useless to try as there is nothing to achieve by playing them. Also the original dark and gritty story has been swapped to a new and lame one, which is all about Max losing another loved one while also being betrayed by someone thought to be a friend of his. The dreams Max is experiencing while the story goes on have lost a big part of their original meaning as a source of dark and twisted feelings.\n\nAfter all there is a huge amount of improvements in Max Payne 2, even though the run and shoot part leaves still much to be desired along with some other downsides seen in the game. Throughout the game you can find some easter eggs, and the mods made for this game can offer you a lot of additional fun. To this date I have beaten Max Payne 2 six times: three times before I had it on Steam and three times after that, with every given difficulty option. Because the game is quite short, I ended up spending only about 30 hours by playing it and could still give it a go. In other words I don't regret the time I have spent playing on this game. If you liked the predecessor of Max Payne 2, without a doubt you will fall in love with this one. The quality has been guaranteed, even though some things mentioned above could have been made better.","December 11, 2015","true","16.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Took me seven hours to beat.\n\nI think Remedy's focus on the Max Payne games is purely the storyline. Gameplay doesn't suffer, of course, but the point of these games is to tell Max's life, which means that you're going to have bits and pieces where you play and pay attention to what the characters are saying as well as the setting Max is in, rather than looking to kill someone or find something.\n\nThis is a great sequel to Max Payne, in my opinion. I was worried that I was going to dislike it, but not much has changed in the way of mechanics or otherwise, and I like that they didn't overhaul much but how people looked.\n\nI did have one odd issue with the game though, after Mona's first level I seemed to have some kind of invincibility up until the last chapter.","July 11, 2013","true","8.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It begins two years after the last game, with the eponymous Max Payne having left the DEA in the wake of his rampage. He is then drawn into another conspiracy, this time with a femme fatale as an ally.\nThe gameplay is standard Max Payne-fare: shoot it up. It is an enjoyable third-person shooter, utilizing the same bullet time gimmick as the first game. The mechanic is now improved, being longer as well as more "fun". A healthy addition to the series is the implementation of Havok physics, meaning that enemies now ragdoll upon death.\nThe game is about 8-10 hours long, depending on how much time you invest into listening to voicemails. In my opinion, it is significantly shorter than the first game.

It makes no attempt to alter the gameplay, and didn't need to- the first game's action was solid, as was its atmosphere and music, both back in full force here (including a Poets of the Fall song) But it does expand Max's story in surprising directions. A mysterious assassin, thought dead. Old friends become new enemies. The machinations of powerful men, dwelling in shadow. And in the middle of it all, Max Payne is trapped, still madly running from his past and his memories, and desiring death, finds instead a reason to live again. But Max is the consumate Noir protagonist, a survivor, cursed to emerge unscathed from the fires of his personal hell again and again. We will see how just how far he can run when Max Payne 3 releases this coming March.","February 18, 2012","true","5.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

May Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne is definitely one of them. I'd say it's the last of the good old games. Max Payne 2 is a strange specimen because it's between two periods, the old and the new. It has the charm of oldschool games while feeling modern and polished. The action is one of the best I've ever seen. The gameplay feels very cinematic, inspired by John Woo's motion pictures. But the best thing they've introduced since the first Max Payne is the physics engine. Enemies fall spectacularly when they die, especially in slow motion, and you can even jump into them and drive them to the floor.\n\nThe visual novel style cutscenes are back from the first game along with the heavy noir atmosphere. This time I fell like they've put a bit more emphasis on the detective aspects of the story which I personally love, and it's still every bit as thrilling as the first game (if not more). The music is great and strengthens the tension in the atmosphere, but the guns sound a little off to me. The main problem with the game is that it's too short in my opinion, but with the challenge modes making a return, and given the exquisite gameplay, I think you'll find yourself playing this game over and over again.\n\nI can't recommend this enough. Go buy it! 10/10","June 21, 2015","true","6.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It depicts a broken Max seeking redemption and he gets this through the game's other main character, a femme fatale known as Mona Sax.\n\nStory: The game is basically a tragic love story between Max Payne and Mona Sax. Over the course of the game, Mona Sax is constantly on the run (for reasons you will find out in the game) and Max Payne, now an NYPD cop must pursue her. The more Max encounters Mona, the more he becomes infatuated with her and this creates an interesting dynamic between them. The story is well-told and interesting but not as poetic and dark as the original Max Payne.\n\nGraphics: I can't say much about the graphics given that it came out more than 10 years ago (in 2003). What I can say that the visuals are still servicable and okay for today's standards and I would imagine that the graphics at the time were ground-breaking. Not so much nowadays.\n\nGameplay: The movement, gunplay and overall responsiveness in MP2 is much improved over Max Payne 1. Now you can equip an item like a grenade to another button, instead of needing to switch to it. Bullet time is back and it feels as good as ever. It is a lot of fun to activate Bullet Time and take out 3 to 4 enemies , and this really makes you feel like a badass. There is much less frustration to the controls this time round.\n\nOverall, Max Payne 2 is a great action game that I believe has stood the test of time and is still better than some action games of today.\n\nI'd give the game an 8.5/10.","June 22, 2015","true","6.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But on more modern PC's the game needs extra work to get running, i'll give instructions at the end of the review. Once you do get the game running you won't wanna stop playing, in my opinion it tells a much better story than the original did and has exellent level design much like the first installment. They kept the fast shooting gameplay of the original Max Payne and the unique comic book cut scenes from the original make a return which is awesome to see. But like I said you need to do a little extra work to get it running which sucks and to some people it may not be big enough of a change to keep it interesting but in the end the game is well worth the purchase price and a great sequal to a great game, I give Max Payne 2 a 9/10.\n\nOkay to get the game running on newer PC's you need to go to msconfig, to get there on Windows 8.1 you should first hold down the windows button usually found on most keyboards on the left side and then hold the R key until a program simply known as Run pops up. Once you complete that step you can simpy type msconfig and and from there enter the program. Once your in head to the boot tab and enter advanced options, then check the box that says number of processors and put it to 1 by clicking it in the box below, then you hit OK and apply and then OK again to exit msconfig. Then it will ask for you to restart your PC to limit the processor usage to 1. To get all of your processing power back in use go back to msconfig and uncheck the the number of processor usage box go through wth OK and apply and restart. Now after all that you can play Max Payne 2: The fall of Max Payne on your Windows 8.1 PC.","August 6, 2015","true","0.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is quite an old game (2003, I believe. I am a fan of old games, for some reason) however it is still one of the best games that I have ever played. The storyline of Max Payne is complex but as you begin to play the game you will understand a bit of what it going on, the characters are well thought out and the missions can be quite fun, reading through the graphic novel function is interesting as instead of having cutscenes, the plot is shown through a graphic novel. You also encounter things like TVs and you can view the ingame TV shows.\nHowever, there are some downsides to the game also such as,\nSometimes a bit of it can be hard to follow and you don't know what is happening/why the mission relates to the game.\nDespite the graphic novel being entertaining, it can be a bit slow and you can get bored of it however there is a skip button if you aren't interested in the game.\nThe last downside is minor but in my opinion the game is quite short, it only took me 7 hours to finish and it would have been a bit better if there were a few more missions.\n\nOverall I rate this game an 9/10, it is a great game to play and I would recommend it to anyone.\n","March 6","true","10.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Pretty much everyone is back from the original Max Payne and we get to see the aftermath of bringing Aesir Corp. down along with Horne, it has been two years according to the wiki. This time around there are 2 main protagonists that you control which offers some interesting segments of teamwork from the two characters to get through seemingly grave situations.\nThe gameplay is pretty much the same with a few tweaks and upgrades making for an even smoother experience this time around. When Max dives you can now continue to stay laying down until you let the trigger go which is definitely a welcome addition. There are definitely more painkillers to be found in Max Payne 2 as well which is fine because it is definitely a challenge at some points. All around this is a proper sequel to a cult classic expanding on the world of Max Payne and you should definitely play through the whole trilogy.\n\nAs a note, the game will take some tweaking to get working as you would like and there are some cool mods like the Max Payne 3 mod which I may try in my next playthrough.\n\n"But I refused to give in.

Well, the solution which work for me was the one described in THIS DISCUSSION (just click here).\nAnd if you encounter some problems with the wide screen like stretching the image, you can use this fix from THIS SITE (just click here)[thirteenag.github.io].\nAnd don't use Anti Aliasing. Disable it in the config window launched by the game. If you want it, force it in your graphic card panel, or it may make the game crash at the cut scenes.\n\nMy rating: 9/10.","November 12, 2015","true","4.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Max Payne 2!!! Don't let my hours played fool you, It's about the 8th time I started playing it which should tell you enough. I'm very passionate about this game cause it's a true piece of art. Yes I said it, like its precursor it's very noticable that the developing team has had tons of fun and heart while making these games (unlike part 3 which rockstar F***'ed in my opinion).\nThe fact alone that they tried to figure out the right style for the game, to make it all come together. The comics that tell you parts of the story in between, the great voice actors (GREAT!!.. VOICE!!.. ACTORS!!), the music, the long story which even ingame has carefully selected cinematic cutscenes..\nFor the love of God if you never played this just buy the freakin' game already, even if it's not on sale!\n\nBesides all this Max Payne 2 was an innovating game bringing slow-motion bullettime to your pc, and it's a gem that can hold its name proudly between other timeless games. Now if you'd excuse me, I got a Max Payne mural to make in my bedroom (no it's not Max in sexy underwear).\nOh, and make sure you watch the tv series in the game. There are many worlds inside this world.\n\n9/10","November 19, 2015","true","12.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But on more modern PC's the game needs extra work to get running, i'll give instructions at the end of the review. Once you do get the game running you won't wanna stop playing, in my opinion it tells a much better story than the original did and has exellent level design much like the first installment. They kept the fast shooting gameplay of the original Max Payne and the unique comic book cut scenes from the original make a return which is awesome to see. But like I said you need to do a little extra work to get it running which sucks and to some people it may not be big enough of a change to keep it interesting but in the end the game is well worth the purchase price and a great sequal to a great game, I give Max Payne 2 a 9/10.\n\nOkay to get the game running on newer PC's you need to go to msconfig, to get there on Windows 8.1 you should first hold down the windows button usually found on most keyboards on the left side and then hold the R key until a program simply known as Run pops up. Once you complete that step you can simpy type msconfig and and from there enter the program. Once your in head to the boot tab and enter advanced options, then check the box that says number of processors and put it to 1 by clicking it in the box below, then you hit OK and apply and then OK again to exit msconfig. Then it will ask for you to restart your PC to limit the processor usage to 1. To get all of your processing power back in use go back to msconfig and uncheck the the number of processor usage box go through wth OK and apply and restart. Now after all that you can play Max Payne 2: The fall of Max Payne on your Windows 8.1 PC.","August 6, 2015","true","0.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But be warned: Steam version is as bad as Max Payne 1. If you have an OS that is newer than Windows XP, you will need to find and install some fixes for the game to even run, and then some more to fix the sounds issues and give it proper widescreen support.\n\nAfter you get it up and running properly, expect the following:\n\n- This game is much, much easier than the original Max Payne. Probably not too easy, but at least you will suffer much less cheap deaths, especially instant ones. Aiming is still hindered by forced vSync, but feels significantly more fluid than in previous game. There are harder modes for more challenge, but you need to beat it on default difficulty first.\n\n- Combat feels less luck-based and more dependent on player's actual skill. Enemies, however, are not as mobile as in MP1, but still move around quite a bit. Weapons are rebalanced and are more diverse and shooting feels, for a lack of better term, just better. However, in most situations the player is stocked with enormous amount of weapons and ammo, which is nice from the variety perspective, but it also means that there is only a handful of instances where ammo conservation is a thing. The boss battle is also much more interesting.\n\n- Physics are improved and expanded. There is semi-decent ragdoll in place now, and there's a lot of reactive clutter all over the levels, which adds quite a bit to the spectacle, especially when there are explosions going off. Speaking of spectacle - it looks just phenomenal for its age. Only human models are somewhat sub-par, but still huge improvement over the original.\n\n- There is a metric ton of side content - TV shows, conversations, environmental storytelling, and thankfully you can skip it all very easily.\n\n- The tone is entirely different now. MP1 was gritty, its humor was dark. MP2 is still a blood-soaked tragedy, but much lighter and cheesier, shifting from noir to alsmot being kitsch. It is both serious and deconstructive at the same time, hard-hitting the player with tangible drama, and then outright mocking events that predated the sequel - just watch a couple of 'episodes' of ♥♥♥♥ Justice on MP2's TVs. MP1 was suffering of both character and player, and MP2 leaves the pain to Payne(see what I did there?). But despite being somewhat bipolar, it delivers the 'feels' when it has the intent to do so.\n\n- Bullet time is revamped. It regenerates now and is easier to use. Whether you'll like it or not is up to a personal preference.\n\nIf you enjoy story-rich third-person shooters this is one of the better ones. Buy it and play it. Just maybe try to buy it elsewhere first.","February 14","true","8.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The Music as well was great over the first one capturing the tone more through more instruments and melody's in them, with my favorite song being the main theme so much so that whenever someone says "Max Payne" its the song that comes into my head : https://youtu.be/u116HbMOF_Y and especially  https://youtu.be/8KuFmGxMcZI\n\nThe game-play improved on 1's largely feeling more satisfying as it felt like you could really land a head-shot successfully and this game probably had the best Bullet Time Mechanics of the whole series.\n\nYet while the game-play improved instead of having a weaker story like in 3 we still got the clever and brilliant writing and setups of Sam Lake and the graphic novel cut-scenes were even better with detail behind them and genuinely very well done so that means that 2 has the better game-play with the series moving on and yet the brilliant writing of the first, so whats the problem? One problem and one problem only : the length.\n\nThis is a very short game around 4-6 hours especially if you are already familiar with the gameplay but usually thats not an issue with me if a game is enjoyable enough like say Uncharted then its fine as its own little adventure. The problem for MP2 is that its meant to act as a mental journey and a true analysis of a broken mind struggling to keep up with the world but because of the shorter length its has to rush scenes and it can feel incomplete in that sense like their are chances for the game to go on and deepen itself with yet it dosent. Say what you want about 3 but its story felt rounded off after a large journey while MP2 kinda goes through the motions with not that much happening in it even though the setups are still there and the writing is still great.\n\nEven though the length is a issue and this the weakest one of the trio its still a great game none-the-less and one that's absolutely worth a shot if you loved the first one.\n\nBonus : Also so you arent lost when trying to get it to work  like i was : https://steamcommunity.com/app/12150/discussions/0/828937979068499775/?l=english\n\nBut also a mod that i want to bring attention to is the "Payne Evolution", where the game is given a MP3 style to it while still retaining the story of 2 as it has an arcade mode, bonus fan made storys and basically alters the gameplay to that similar of Max Payne 3 and its a really great mod to check out with a lot of extra content there to add onto the main game itself adding another few hours of fun to have with 2 if youre not coming back to play it again.\nMod : http://www.moddb.com/mods/payne-evolution\n\n8/10 (8.5/10 With Payne Evolution mod as well otherwise)","February 20","true","12.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In just 2 years Remedy was able to make a sequel that made the combat even more engaging, have the dream sequences feel even more ominous, have more depth into it's main character and have some great development in-general. The atmosphere of the world is so thick you can shoot bullets through it. This game also acts as a staple of "past generation game design" with some solutions to problems being left for you to figure it out and some non-linear paths to events of the gameplay just from the player mucking about or listening to NPCs. One moment has Payne going through an apartment complex with a couple civillians that can tag along with you, helping you out in gunfights and even giving you cover when you reach a certain point. Or you can simply shoot them right away, there's no penalty for it. As long as you have a gun in your had at the time you can shoot anyone and everyone you like.\nThere's simple touches to the gameplay that don't do much other than making Payne look even cooler (slo-mo reloading). Another one of these is TV, yes you can just sit back (stand) and watch some telly. Being honest, I spent 10 minutes watching different things on the TV until it started repeating, damn. One of the things on the TV leads into the great and not very obvious or in your face symbolism. 2 of the recurring shows on the TV give some nice symbolism to the events of the story at the moment that you watch it, or into Payne's own mindset. Sometimes even teasing future events yet to happen. And by the last level you can watch both series finale's. It's this great dream-like state that the game has that I particularly loved and that the games use to great effect. There's some nice cameo's that, if you're paying attention, you'll notice right away as well. A few points give you control of a second character for story purposes, and it's a little weird when you discover that she has the same bullet-time abilities as Payne.\nJust like the last one, Max's VA is just brilliant at his lines. While everyone else is either "eergh", okay or inconsistant with  their performance. Unlike the last one the game works like a charm, with absolutely no bugs or technical problems. By the end the game's world feels just as lonely and cold as Payne is feeling from what's happened during the game, the way the story unravels is great and some moment are pretty heavy *-*. Unfortuately it doesn't have the visual scope of the original and a lot of the locations you are in are just the same places you were in the last game. There are a couple great set pieces though that allow opportunities for the level design to be more creative and one being a theme park of sorts for one of the TV shows in the game, which is mainly for the psychological themes to kick in. But that unfortunately get old by the 2nd and 3rd visit there. You should already be playing/ have finished this if you enjoyed the first one, and the ending gives some great mystery to where Max's life is going to head to next. I ONLY wish it was longer.\n9/10 :)","November 14, 2015","true","34.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Nothing","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198053588824/","11 products in account","Just two years after the first Max Payne (2001) was released, Remedy came up with their second creation of the series, Max Payne 2 (2003). This time they developed a game which had a whole lot of better graphics, upgraded game mechanics, more interesting level design, a bunch of new guns and an enhanced level of voice acting as well as an enhancend level of enemy AI.\n\nAnyhow, like it's predecessor, Max Payne 2 is also quite a fast-paced game. The guns introduced in the game have a good feel on them and while bullet time or shoot dodge is being used at the same time, it will double the enjoyment. Also, the enemies are not able to take ridiculous amount of bullets before they die anymore, which is a huge improvement on its own over the first Max Payne game. The gradually slowing bullet time is an awesome invention as it is easier for the player to handle big amount of opponents at the same time. The controllabilty of Max's moves is still going strong, the level of voice acting is great and because there is some improvements on the enemy AI, Max Payne 2 is a very enjoyable game at its best.\n\nNow, not only the game mechanics has been proven to be better in Max Payne 2 than they are in Max Payne 1, but also the graphics have taken a big leap forward. Overall the environmental texturing have gotten to a higher level. Max can see his own reflection and the faces seen in the game are more natural than they used to be in the previous Max Payne game. The cars are a bit more than just boxes on the wheels and the whole level design is much more interesting.\n\nDespite all the enhancements, the game is still all about running and shooting with no considerable variation between the firefights you encounter. The overall amount of usable guns is still quite low and the game will not last too long, as an average person who is playing the game through for the first time can beat the game in about 5 hours. Additional game modes seem to be quite useless to try as there is nothing to achieve by playing them. Also the original dark and gritty story has been swapped to a new and lame one, which is all about Max losing another loved one while also being betrayed by someone thought to be a friend of his. The dreams Max is experiencing while the story goes on have lost a big part of their original meaning as a source of dark and twisted feelings.\n\nAfter all there is a huge amount of improvements in Max Payne 2, even though the run and shoot part leaves still much to be desired along with some other downsides seen in the game. Throughout the game you can find some easter eggs, and the mods made for this game can offer you a lot of additional fun. To this date I have beaten Max Payne 2 six times: three times before I had it on Steam and three times after that, with every given difficulty option. Because the game is quite short, I ended up spending only about 30 hours by playing it and could still give it a go. In other words I don't regret the time I have spent playing on this game. If you liked the predecessor of Max Payne 2, without a doubt you will fall in love with this one. The quality has been guaranteed, even though some things mentioned above could have been made better.","December 11, 2015","true","16.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Now a police detective, Max is thrust into a conspiracy involving a group of hitmen known as the "Cleaners." In the process of digging up their identity, he comes across Mona Sax, a femme fatale he assumed had been dead for two years. Making an unlikely duo, they work together to uncover dark secrets and create new ones.\n\n+The action is even better this time. The first game set the bar with its bullet time mechanics, and the sequel works to apply a fine polish. Now, during slowdown, you can quickly reload with a stylish spin, allowing you to pull of some impressive clears. All the guns handle well and the controls are precise. There wasn't a bad action sequence in this game.\n+Stellar plot. Max and Mona's complex relationship adds a layer of intrigue to the mystery. Given their nature--one a cop, one a criminal--the story chooses to test how far they will go to aid each other. Like all good noir stories, there is romance, betrayal, violence, and overwhelming darkness. It's a short story, but the plot is solid, an improvement from the previous title. This time to graphic novel style looks a little better in appearance, and isn't as overwhelmed with tiresome metaphors.\n+Attention to detail. Contrary to the last game, Max Payne 2 has some wonderful environments. Back alleys, drug dens, funhouses, police stations; it's much more varied this time. While it remains a linear game, there is plenty to explore and uncover. Every stage has television sets that you can interact with. Each features a handful of shows that will reoccur throughout the game. They are very campy in nature and tend to have parallels with Max's own situation, revealing how silly the plot can sound without the dark overtones. It's clear that the game isn't afraid to make fun of itself, and that makes the experience easy to appreciate.\n\n-Game length. It only took about five hours to beat the game. At 9.99 this is no issue. It's well worth the money. But at the same time, this game was once sold at full retail price. There are plenty of modes to replay the game with, but I'm not sure if it would have warranted a full purchase. I don't want to undersell how much I loved the game (it has to be one of the best games I've ever played), but it was almost too short. The first game had a good length, and this one was about three hours short of that. That said, nothing in the game feels like a waste of time. There is no padding to be found. Everything that occurs moves the plot along efficiently. It's unfortunate that such a good experience only lasts for such a short time, but I understand the reasoning.\n-Glitches. There was one level, an escort mission, that I had issues with due to a glitch. The character I was protecting would not go through a doorway, and continued to get stuck even when I restarted the mission. It took a bit of fiddling around to manage to get him through (I basically had to use the door to smash him through the doorway). This was the only part of the game I had issues with, but it did dampen my experience. Without this moment of annoyance, Max Payne 2 could've been an entirely perfect game. It's strange to witness, as the rest of the game seems technically astounding.\n\nMax Payne 2 is an incredible game. It puts most current-gen shooters to shame and has a story that is enjoyable from start to finish. The short length is a bit jarring, but the end result is a game that feels like a full experience. There is no useless filler to pad out the experience. Instead, Max Payne 2 leaves you feeling very satisfied by the end.\n\nBuy it. It's one of the best shooting games out there.","April 10","true","5.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

They are very campy in nature and tend to have parallels with Max's own situation, revealing how silly the plot can sound without the dark overtones. It's clear that the game isn't afraid to make fun of itself, and that makes the experience easy to appreciate.\n\n-Game length. It only took about five hours to beat the game. At 9.99 this is no issue. It's well worth the money. But at the same time, this game was once sold at full retail price. There are plenty of modes to replay the game with, but I'm not sure if it would have warranted a full purchase. I don't want to undersell how much I loved the game (it has to be one of the best games I've ever played), but it was almost too short. The first game had a good length, and this one was about three hours short of that. That said, nothing in the game feels like a waste of time. There is no padding to be found. Everything that occurs moves the plot along efficiently. It's unfortunate that such a good experience only lasts for such a short time, but I understand the reasoning.\n-Glitches. There was one level, an escort mission, that I had issues with due to a glitch. The character I was protecting would not go through a doorway, and continued to get stuck even when I restarted the mission. It took a bit of fiddling around to manage to get him through (I basically had to use the door to smash him through the doorway). This was the only part of the game I had issues with, but it did dampen my experience. Without this moment of annoyance, Max Payne 2 could've been an entirely perfect game. It's strange to witness, as the rest of the game seems technically astounding.\n\nMax Payne 2 is an incredible game. It puts most current-gen shooters to shame and has a story that is enjoyable from start to finish. The short length is a bit jarring, but the end result is a game that feels like a full experience. There is no useless filler to pad out the experience. Instead, Max Payne 2 leaves you feeling very satisfied by the end.\n\nBuy it. It's one of the best shooting games out there.","April 10","true","5.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

To keep it short, everything that was already god-tier, remained as good as possible or is even better. Every encounter with enemies is fun, killing them while using slowmo, or without it, is Max of fun. Characters, story and music stays for very long time in memory. Heck, even after playing it again for the first time in 10+ years I haven't forget many stuff. Maybe after so many time I started to think that story in this game is much darker than in previous one.\nComics like always are interesting but for some reason, I really missed style used in first game. But for this little Payne, we got something much more amazing - MONA SAX. How fun it is to play here, to move her beatiful body. Probably one of my first gaming loves that never ended. Many years ago there was also special mod... who played Max Payne 2 back then will know what kind of mod I'm talking about. Wasn't dissapointed when I got my hands on this mod, even tho you could call this The Fall nowadays, I didn't regret anything.\nThere is also this amazing game mode where you fight waves of enemies - I remember how many times I played this together with a friend of mine. To show-off who really is better, who reached the 5th minute for the first time, who managed to kill more enemies (yes, while one was playing the other one was counting dead bodies). Really great times and memories.\n\nIt's not only nostalgia, Max Payne 2 is really great game. Some people will prefer the first one, some this one, but I really love both of Max Payne games and can't really think which one is better. If you enjoyed the previous one, if you want more, get it and play it. Few difficulty modes, additional game mode and beating each of chapters of game as fast as you can will bring you many hours of fun. I'm sure that there will be time when I will once again play this masterpiece.","May 18","true","10.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Detective Payne has traded his ridiculous, frozen smirk of the past game for a fully-rendered face with lips that actually move in the rare occurrence that he utters something out loud. The TV shows that can be watched on scattered TV sets have been similarly flesh out. Not only do they tell longer, more complete stories, but those stories tie into the game's plot thematically. Even the platforming elements that made the original Max Payne seem overall less professional have been toned down to the point of unobtrusiveness. And of course, there's still a full shooting gallery worth of mooks to mow down in bullet-time, all of which is still broken up by graphic novel-styled cutscenes. This sequel is simply a second helping of Payne with a few improvements thrown into the mix - almost a continuation. Loose ends left by its predecessor are tied up along the way and this distinct tale finishes up a little neater than the last. It feels like the punctuation on Max's story, and though more of this good thing would be welcome, it feels complete.","May 30","true","9.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Unfortunately it sold poorly despite it's brilliant innovations in noir-style story telling and overall improvement.\n\nGameplay\nGameplay remains mainly unchanged except that bullet time has been tweaked so that transitions in bullet time and reloading now seemlessly react, continuing the action and letting the player experience a full Hard Boiled scene of frantic gunfire and shootdodging!\n\nDifficulty was judged via the AI, on all three difficult settings which give less bullet time - meaning you have to manage it or die very easily due to the high damage of bullets shot from enemies. Enemies also react much faster and take cover when injured.\n\n\nCriticisms\nMajor\nMassively stripped down difficulty from the first game which was reasonably difficult on it's own. I partially want to add that I played this on Dead on Arrival and found it far too easy even with the limited Bullet Time and increased damage from bullets and less regeneration from painkillers.\n\nWeird criticism for sure but this is not a fault of Remedy's, it's a fault of Rockstar's getting their grubby hands on a franchise themselves published but developed in such a way that used their own version of writing which was far poorer than Sam Lakes, it also ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ized Max's character and removed every bit of the NOIR setting it initially had for a sleazy Brazil location. (which was intended for GTAIV, i.e R*AGE)\n\nMinor\nFar too much sub-weapon types that have a similar recoil pattern, compared to the original Max Payne, this makes the game rather easy to play.\n\nShotguns are incredibly weak in this game.\n\nGunplay\nGun-totting, fast, frantic slow-motion action, which puts a clear emphasis on using bullet time to see the bullets follow the path of your aim which grants you with scenes of grandiose violence and ragdolling hilarity and cinematic badassery.\n\nPistols are the starting equipment of Max Payne's arsenal - a weak overall firearm but ammo is frequent, rifles are mediocre in terms of damage but accurate and easily land headshots like no tommorow, explosives cover a wide radius but risk Max's health as well, sub-machine guns are balanced and damage wise but their rate of fire is far superior that the DPS (Damage Per Second) compensates for it.\n\nMusic\nA transition from heavy mix of piano and double bass to many an noir orchestra mix of violins, harspicords (?) and the occassional electronica to tie it together.\n\nGraphics\nCharacters model quality has improved majorly. Max and characters have vertex facial animation now and their animations look impressive (for the time). Shadowmapping ensures realistic lighting. Environment feels alive with criminal activies and the scale is larger than before.\n\nMechanics\nStoryline\nAfter Max Payne killed Nicole Horne, responsible for the V drug, Max had bouts of depression about the death of his wife and daughter. Investigations into the "Cleaners" reveal a conspiracy plot that would blow New York city apart.Vladimir Lem has setup shop in the old nightclub Ragnarok and called it Vodka.\n\nEvaluation\nRecommended for purchase because of it's classic status.","March 15, 2015","true","53.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
