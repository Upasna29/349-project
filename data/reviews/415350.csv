It's insultingly easy until almost half an hour into a run; even then, every boss save every fifth has only one attack - almost all of which are defeated by doing circles around them to redirect the fire. Every fifth boss is Chuck Norris, who has three attacks and two life bars just in case being guaranteeed to see him every five minutes wasn't enough. The best source of variety is in the game's secondary attacks; while a five second cooldown is probably too generous, the number of different weapons one can pick up and try might keep you awake.\n\nIt's also physically painful to know that some people consider the humor(?) this game delivers to be amusing. If this isn't a dealbreaker, the game itself still isn't really worth buying at full price. If you're curious (and unwilling to buy a better shooter instead), wait for it to be heavily discounted to included in a bundle.","April 17","false","3.4"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheIronicGamer/recommended/415350/","TheIronicGamer","TheIronicGamer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheIronicGamer/","1545 products in account","A cautious recommendation on this one. A colourful game with good shoot em up style but I believe the games main focus, the comedy, is where it really falls down on.\n\nLet's start with the gameplay. Shooting stars is a rather standard SHMUP as it goes. You control a character with your mouse, and can only shoot up using the left click. Enemies have standard bullet hell style patterns. Nothing out of the ordinary exists here in the simple mechanics of the game.\n\nPower ups also exist in shooting stars. You have the simple ones, usually food of some kind, that upgrade your laser ability. They add extra beams, missiles or stronger beams and more. You can get health and armour upgrades. These are all nice but once again nothing much out of the ordinary yet. The real pleasure comes from the ultimate ability. Pressing right click on your mouse will activate this. You don't start with any but find them in powerup boxes throughout levels, There are tonnes of different abilities you can get and each are very satisfying to use.\n\nEnemy design is a mixed bag. Some are way too simple in terms of their bullet patterns or assemblisation of enemies. It would be ok if there were just a few of these simple enemies but too many exist which can make it boring at times. There are few other more creative enemies that have unique patterns but not enough I feel. Most are just reskins using exactly the same bullet patterns which can make gameplay feel stale quickly.\n\nThe real effort has been put into the design of the bosses. These have very creative attacks and bullet patterns associated with them. Bosses are very satisfying to fight. Each are unique and I found none that were reskins. They become very difficult to fight while avoiding all the fury of bullets your presented with.\n\nThe biggest issue I found with gameplay is that i'm not positive if theres an actual end to the game. There are 5 levels in each gameplay session which each exist with there own boss. Once I completed the final boss on the 5th level I expected there to be a big ending. Instead I was presented with continued gameplay that just increased in difficulty. Needless to say I was very disappointed after all the effort I put in. So i'm not positive if an actual end exists or if it just continues increasing in difficulty.\n\nAnother small issue I found was with certain effects obscuring gameplay vision. Some powerups had overly large areas of attack that when used would leave the almost the entirety of the gameplay area not visible. Also after certain achievements in kills you would get a large message on the screen titled "rampage" which also obscured the area for a few seconds. These effects often caused me to loose health due to being unable to see enemies or bullets. This was a minor annoyance but could definitely do with being changed.\n\nNow that i've got all the gameplay aspects out the way i'll move onto to the comedy aspect. The way in which the developers chose to do comedy is through the bosses. Each boss of a level is a famous celebrity/ video game character. There are people such as Miley Cyrus, Gabe Newell, Chuck Norris, Daft Punk and tonnes more. They speak quotes before each level. This is the part that's meant to be funny. The issue I have is that the references are often so obscure that I don't actually find it funny. In very few of the bosses did I actually get a little giggle out of it.\n\nThe only other comedy aspects present was sometimes through pickups. These were sometimes references to internet memes. They had short quotes on them which were also meant to be funny. These two things were the only comedy aspects present. Usually the fact that a game isn't really funny wouldn't be a problem for me. But the problem I have with this game is that the steam page seems to show the game being very focused on being funny. I just found the comedy to be way too obscure and mostly just immature and unfunny.\n\nThe graphics themselves is something I found particularly satisfying. An intriging pixel design with colour thrown about everywhere. Seriously this game is one of the most colourful I have seen. It's the first thing that caught my attention towards this game. But I know it's standard of the SHMUP genre usually but a minor annoyance is the fact of the bars either side instead of being a full screen game. Although it is also clear from some other aspects that this game is a mobile port. A wonderful soundtrack is also present to go along great with the graphic choice. A nice selection of dance/ techno tracks to make fighting enemies particularly satisfying.\n\nOverall shooting stars is a rather standard SHMUP for the most part. It's definitely not a bad game, but it really doesn't do much to build upon the already well established genre. The developers attempts at comedy didn't go down well with me but it may appeal more to other audiences. I'm also not sure on the amount of replayability. I've played 1 hour and feel like i've played enough of it now. As I said it's a very cautious recommendation but it's probably worth a try if your a big fan of shoot em up games.\n\nTheIronicGamers rating system\nDon't ever buy this game.\nNot recommended\nMaybe consider it on a sale\nAn average game\nRecommended\nHighly recommended\nA must play!\nFor more recommendations and reviews on our favourite up and coming quality games follow Lot's O Giveaway's group curations here!","April 3","true","3.7"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198095348647/recommended/415350/","76561198095348647","Lemon Drops | trade.tf","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198095348647/","487 products in account","Review copy provided from developer. Note that my ability to enjoy a game is not influenced by how I recieved it.\nShooting Stars! is a colourful* bullet-hell shoot 'em up centred around a hoverboard hipster and his ability to destroy.... Memes?\n\nAs Shooting Stars! certainly isn't the type of game that would warrant the need for an in-depth story/plot, the lack of one does not make me feel the need to talk about it. Therefore, I will skip this aspect as it does not prove to be a positive or a negative.\n\nFor those who are uncertain where to place their palms, Shooting Stars! offers three control options consisting of keyboard, controller and mouse. This was a convenient idea that proved to be, well, convenient.\n\nAfter these controls have appeared to you, the real gameplay commences. The style of which this gameplay identifies to have is quite common in bullet-hell games; nothing new or innovative. Each enemy follows a particular pattern in a hoard filled with the same enemies. Even though there is a small variety of these enemies, their attack style is relatively similar and a lot of the time they do the same attack, just as a different enemy. By far the most enjoyable enemies to face were found in the boss battles. Each boss has a unique pattern and attack style. With 20 of them, they don't exactly get repetitive.\n\nPowerups are dropped throughout your time playing, some of which are simple, ranging from laser enhancements to health upgrades. The others, however, cause total destruction and annihilation of your enemies. In other words: they are a variety special abilities that have a cool down on them, but when you do activate them they produce some very interesting attacks. Despite how satisfying it is to fire a giant rainbow laser beam, they can be quite a disruption to the gameplay. When you pick up these certain powerups, giant text is thrown across the screen blocking your vision. It gets much worse when you actually activate the abilities and you have no idea what is actually going on due to the giant flashing lasers worthy of causing an epileptic seizure. I'm looking at you Acid Rain.\n\nAfter your seizure has passed you will find yourself in the situation of having just completed the 6th level (the anticlimactic ending) and getting instructions on how the levels will get harder from here, etc. I believe that the levels then go into an endless mode but I am unsure as, well, the levels get harder from there.\n\nAs far as SHMUPs go, this game's gameplay certainly doesn't stand out. But is it enjoyable? Yes, I would say so.\n\nVisually, this game is quite colourful and vibrant as I am sure you would have gathered from the screenshots. The pixel art looks nice, so overall: visually pleasing.\n\nThe music is another aspect that was pleasing. It's something simple to listen to as you go about shooting up some celebrities. Regarding sounds, pretty standard.\n\nNow, we have finally reached talking about the strongest selling point for this game: memes. Unfortunately, this is by far the weakest point of the game. You see, memes are easy to make people laugh. Not genuinely laugh, they only laugh because they have been told they should laugh because it's a meme-reference to pop culture. As PewDerPie pops up on the screen, you're meant to let out a giggle because it's actually PewDiePie. See how it's funny? Yeah, me neither. The way you have to sit through reading what the celebrities say as you wait to go to the next level is also quite annoying. It's just an annoyance and distraction from the gameplay. I think all I really need to say is that the comedy aspect of the game falls flat, and not on a soft surface**.\n\n\nSummary:\nPros:\n✔ 3 ways to control the game\n✔ Great bosses\n✔ Interesting powerups\n✔ Relatively enjoyable gameplay\n✔ Visually pleasing\n✔ Good music\n\nCons:\n✘ Uninteresting enemies\n✘ Nothing innovative\n✘ Picking up and using powerups blocks your vision\n✘ Comedy aspect fails\n\nConclusion:\nShooting Stars! is a relatively enjoyable yet surprisingly mediocre entry into a large collection of SHMUPs. It doesn't have anything that stands out (apart from the meme aspect which falls flat) but this is not enough to make it a bad game. I recommend this game to people heavily interested in the genre, otherwise catch it on sale.\n\n6.5/10\n\n\n----------------------------------------\n* Yes, my lack of conforming to atrocious American spelling is indeed an act of rebellion.\n** I'm talking about concrete, or some painful ♥♥♥♥ like that.\n\nDid you enjoy that review?

The random nature of the stages and power-ups gives good replayability.\n\nThe Bad:  Some of the power-ups are not good.  Explosions shake the screen, making pinpoint bullet dodging a matter of luck instead of skill.  If you aren't big into pop culture, most of the game's premise and cameos will go over your head.\n\nThe SaHD:  Playing with the keyboard wasn't very precise.  The mouse was better, but you had to shoot to move and cramped my hand after 10 minutes or so.
