I can honestly say this game has left me completely satisfied with my purchase, and despite having bought the bundle at the beginning of the summer, and played every day, it was at least a month before I even opened Saints Row 3 for the first time, because I was having so much fun playing Saints Row 2, and there is simply that much to do.  With 233.8 hours on record as of my review, I still am only at about 95-97% completion on my first and only playthrough, because it was simply too much fun screwing around.  Even after finishing the story missions, of which there are more than enough to make the game worth buying all by itself, there was still so much to do.\n\nThe controls took a bit of getting used to, but only at first.  After a short while, any oddities control-wise felt completely natural, which is far from always the case when talking about ported titles.  The only thing I could recommend a controller for would be the driving/piloting.  While driving ground vehicles, the WASD keys don't quite give you the best experience, but they work perfectly fine for it.  The main complaint I had about the game in general were the flight controls, which were awkward at first, but even after getting used to the layout, which wasn't that strange, it still lacked the ability to make small adjustments without losing control, unless you practice a lot. (I practiced a lot though, and mostly was able to work around it.) I got so accustomed to the keybindings in this game that I actually changed most of my SR3 keybindings to match (where they were different at least) because I found I honestly missed many of the default keybindings where they had been changed.  Still, using a console controller for the air vehicles is probably your best option, if nothing else.\n\nThe graphics are far from amazing by current standards, but considering the time the game was made, they're perfectly solid, and the water still looks more real than watch dogs (you actually have a wake in a boat! HOW ADVANCED!! Sorry had to. considering I got this game in a huge bundle for only 18 dollars, I am not only satisfied, I would gladly have paid $18 dollars for this game alone, if I evaluated the value of the game solely on the amount of fun I had playing it.  All in all, I fully recommend this game and hope others enjoy it as much as I have.","September 24, 2014","true","233.8"," 263 of 269 people (98%) found this review helpful 30 people found this review funny","98","263","269","30","0"

The others are bigger and crazier but this one is the real deal.\n\nIt has the most alive city. There are lots of different individuals. People, constructions, cars and general theme changes from district the district. So you never get the feeling of hanging around same place over and over again.\n\nStory is what it should be in an open world game. Three enemy gangs and you want to end them all. Simple. But the way they present it with missions is really impressive. There are lots of touching moments as well as action packed ones. In some mission I felt so angry that I find myself finishing all of the gangs mission in one play.\n\nIn my opinion GTA was always very linear. This one has three set of missions that you can do in whatever order you want. And if you are bored from doing it you have tons of funny activities.\n\nCustomization options are huge. For cars, gang and yourself. There are some crazy and useless ones but you could nearly create and ideal character for your taste.\n\nSo any cons? Yeah of course. Driving is kinda hard. Cars don't respond right most of the time and you feel driving a paper car or something. Graphics are out of date of course (which is not a problem for me because I have and old computer). Finishing activities can be so much hard sometimes, 6 level a bit hard, 3 is ideal I think. There are some bugs in some missions and graphics but they are not a big deal. And there are some problems with the default controls but I'm sure you can make it work. You get used to after a while.\n\nIn conclusion this game still has it. It has all the right touches. Yes it is an old game but still one of the best open world game I have played. I give it at least an 8 out 10. It is not expensive. So you should try it...\n\nPS: You know what makes this game better, steam achievements.. And trading cards... Ohh I wish...\nPS-2: I didn't play any other version of the game so I couldn't compare them. But this one worked just nice for my PC.","November 10, 2014","true","34.6"," 140 of 153 people (92%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","92","140","153","9","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheManko/recommended/9480/","TheManko","TheManko","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheManko/","409 products in account","I’m glad I decided to play this game! The only reason I started playing it was because I finished Saints Row 4 and loved it, which made me want more. As it turns out Saints Row 2 feels like it hardly belongs in the same franchise as the fourth game. Volition have truly reinvented the franchise as they’ve gone from title to title, only keeping the characters and setting as they go. This explains why the people who loved the second game and wanted more of that tend to complain loudly about the third and fourth games. They’re just not the same. Personally I think reinventing and iterating are both equally valid approaches for a series to take. I like the variety, and you certainly can’t accuse them of retreading the same ground like I’ve seen some do with Rockstar and the GTA series.\n\nSaints Row 2 came out in 2008, and it feels like a game of its time. It might not seem like 2008 is that far back, but when you play games of that time they all feel old now, as does Saints Row 2. At that time I remember games journalists were talking about emergent gameplay instead of story, and it shows in Saints Row 2’s design. Compared to any major game released in 2013 this feels like complete chaos. Instead of the world acting like a virtual movie set with carefully staged combat, the game instead relies on world simulation systems and AI to act on its own. This approach makes it nearly impossible for a developer to tell a story during missions, because the minute to minute gameplay is completely unpredictable. Instead the designer only choreographs the action with commands like: Go there, kill that, chase that car, etc.\n\nEven during missions the world simulation present in the free exploration mode is in full effect. So when you take over areas of the map you’ll have friendly thugs spawn there. If a mission happens to take place there, or a car chase goes through neighborhoods controlled by your gang, groups of friendly thugs will spawn and rain bullets on your pursuers. If during a mission an enemy shoots a civilian standing near you, police will arrive on the scene and start fighting the enemy gangsters with you. The last time I saw this kind of three way combat break out spontaneously was in the Stalker games. I wish we had more games like this, especially on the next-gen consoles where the extra memory and power could allow much more elaborate world simulation. That would in some way fulfill “the point” of next-gen hardware. Making something you couldn’t do on 360/ps3, just like this game is something that couldn’t exist on PS2.\n\nAnyway, I had a great time blowing through this game. It’s messy, ugly, glitch, but it all comes together to create something special. One thing I was pleasantly surprised by was the quality of the cutscenes. In Saints Row 4 they were generally very high quality, but in a couple scenes I found the sound to be a bit crap. In Saints Row 2 the sound during cutscenes is phenomenal. It’s raw, violent and has about as much impact as you could hope to have. It fits perfectly with the story itself which in the “Brotherhood” missions turns into an ugly conflict where neither side appear noble or heroic in any way. It’s dark, gruesome and I was even shocked at one scene where the game made it abundantly clear that the player isn’t a hero anyone should aspire to be. So I finally get where the hype about Saints Row 2 has come from. If you know you’re a fan of slightly janky games with outstanding qualities you’ll probably like this. Those wanting a slick, modern, controlled experience should avoid it like the plague.","January 21, 2014","true","15.9"," 175 of 202 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","175","202","0","18"

The PC port of Saints Row 2 is just horrendous.

THere's a lot to do and lot to play with but I personally thought the story missions were the strong point of the game. The missions were fun and varied quite a lot. Boss fights were fun yet a little too easy. But that isn't really a big downside since the other missions are so strong.\n\nI recommend Saints Row 2 to everyone if you are willing to look past it's problems (which can be fixed with mods, by the way) and give it a shot.

But in the end, it was worth it.\n\ni will list here what we did to make the game work just fine, and save you the nightmare we went through to get it to work.\n\nSo let's start!\n\n\n\n1.Fixing most bugs -  First of all, as you can see in other reviews aswell, you WILL need to install "Gentlemen of the row" mod. It's a mod that fixes many knows bugs and even adds awesome thingies to the game. BUT, i was on windows 7 and GOTR dident fix the fast forward animations bug, but another mod did. (link to GOTR - http://idolninja.com/sr2.php\n)\n\n2.Fixing the fast animations -  So as i mentioned before, i had problems with the fast forward animations, which really annoyed me and i really couldent take it. I was really close to quitting and leaving that game forever and then i found a mod called: "Saints row 2 Powertools". after i did as the "readme" file told me to, the animations still ran really fast, and i was so dissapointed becuse i really wanted that to work, but it dident. And so just the momment i lost hope, i remembered that there is a configuration file in the mod's files. And if after you put the mod in the folder install it and still it dosent work, you need to go to the game folder, search for a file called: "Powertools.ini" open it, go to speed precentage, and set it to 0.9.\nThat solved me the problem and the game ran normally. (link to saint row 2 powertools - http://saintsrowpowertools.com/\n)\n\n3. Connecting to the internet - My friend wanted at first to use tunngle but it dident really work on my computer for some reason, so he looked for other lan hosting apps, and he found evolve. It's a pretty good softwere and a easy one aswell. My friend installed it, while i already had it. He created a party, and it worked just fine! (link to evolve - https://www.evolvehq.com/welcome\n). If your friend hosted a multiplayer coop and you want to join, just go to coop - lan game - choose his server - load or create a new character - ENJOY!\n\n\nSo that's all, that's how i made my game work just fine! i hope i helped anyone who needed, and have fun doing stupid ♥♥♥♥ in SAINTS ROW 2.","May 12","true","8.7"," 61 of 63 people (97%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","97","61","63","8","5"

Although it is a good game, Saints Row 2 is the better game. Why? It takes itself less seriously than GTA but it still has meaningfulness that Saints Row 3 and 4 lack. The gangs are realistic and the campaings are good, whereas the latter games are just crazy. They are fun, but that is pretty much it. Shaundi and Pierce look better in Saints Row 3, but in Saints Row 2 they are likable and are useful and fun to invite around the city. The driving sucks, but the customization is good.

Even on the best hardware around this game will not stay at a stable 60 fps on high settings. But I still prefer the pc version over the console version. On the xbox 360 and ps3 the game often goes below 30 fps and crashes from time to time. At least the pc version never crashed when I played it and it never went below 30 fps on my pc. Also the online doesn't work anymore because gamespy closed down, so if you want to play with a friend you need to use hamachi or evolve and run a lan game.\n\nWith that out of the way, let the real review begin.\nIt's one of the most enjoyable games I ever played. It may even be one of my favorite games of all times for many reasons. But the #1 reason has to be the humor and the near perfect balance of semi-serious crime drama and wacky comedy. I found myself laughing almost all the way trough the story. If I like humor so much then why don't I think that SR3 and 4 are better? Well the fun moments are so balanced out that it works that much better. In SR4 it bombards you with funny things but you get too used to it. In SR2 the funny moments are balanced out so that you don't get used to things being whacky and you'll apreciate the fun/whacky moments more for it.\n\nThere also is the crazy amount of custumization in the game. You can decide at what angle you tilt your hat. I don't think I need to say more than that.\n\nThe gameplay is pretty standard. It plays like a modern version of the ps2 gta games. But the minigames are amazing. You can join a wrestling club, spray poop on houses to devalue the land,  pretend to get hurt to claim insurance, steal hookers from their pimps, ride a burning quad though the city and more. I'm not kidding. These are actual minigames. There are also standard ones like racing, being a hitman, stealing certain cars, etc. I do hate the fact that you need to complete mini games to unlock story missions but I probably wouldn't have played them otherwise.\n\nThe music is also pretty good. I really like the 80's radio station. There are cd shops in the city where you can buy music to make a mic tape with to listen to in your car on the way to your next burning quad time trial. (I especially love Out of Touch and Down Under).\n\nThe entire story is playable in co-op and you will see your own charcter in the cutscenes (not the host's character). What I mean by that is that you will get more enjoyement out of the game itself with a friend while you still expierience the entire story like you were playing alone.\n\nMy final point is: It's only 10 euros or your regional equivalent when it's not on sale. In the sale it's usually 2,50 euros.\nThis game is easily worth 20 euros.\n\nVerdict\nI love SR2 and I see no reason to not tell you to buy this if you haven't already. And if you are still on the fence wait until it's on sale and get it then.  Having said that I will recommend checking if your pc can run this. The recommended system requirements do not garuantee that the game will work at a stable 30 fps!","August 15, 2015","true","39.5"," 45 of 53 people (85%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","85","45","53","3","3"

It tried to launch without first setting a resolution to launch in. Okay. I download a default .ini file off the internet to launch the game ina  640x480 window and set up my options.\nNo mouse support in menus. Alright, whatever. Doesn't break the game.

The game can be fully co-oped if you wish but its plenty fun solo as well.\n\nThe driving is arcadey but works just fine with the keyboard+mouse combo in my experience. The character generator is top notch and the clothing selection and permutations allowed really makes it possible to make your character look pretty much as you want him to which adds a lot to the game if this matters to you.\n\nThe only real issues with the game are technical ones. The FPS limiting doesn't let you maximize the use of your card and you are basically stuck at 30 FPS and lower for most of the game at your 'ideal' settings. Also there might be an issue with the game running too slow or too fast but it didn't arise for me. The fix is easy to google though.\n\nIf you got a decent machine or better don't let these issues discourage you if you enjoy open word mayhem.\n","December 4, 2011","true","69.0"," 31 of 33 people (94%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","94","31","33","3","0"

This game is (atleast by my opinion) the best installment in the franchise. I had alot of fun with it I must say.  STORY: Do you need to know the story of the first game? Well no but it's better if you do because there are some characters from the first Saints Row aswell as some references to it. I think the story is pretty decent (Even though there are about 8-9 missions and about 4-5 Stronghold mission for one gang). There are some touching moments (Most of them referring to the first game). GAMEPLAY: So I need to say that the combat with guns is pretty balanced. You can use just one pistol or two pistols in both hands but with having only one you have better aim but you can deal less damage at the time and if you use two of them you get less accurate but at close range you'll deal more damage (You see where I'm going?). This gives you the freedom in choosing what do you want to have. Then you have here the Respect Bar which serves for doing missions. When you level up your Respect Bar you can play missions. That means for example if you have no level in your Respect bar (Which decreases after doing a mission BTW) you can't play a mission. You need to do some side-activities to gain Respect and with it you can play missions afterwards. Which makes the game pretty long but yet still fun to play. Then you've got alot of shops for buying clothes,food (food in this game serves as a quick regeneration of your health),weapons,music for your very own radio and more. GRAPHICS: Well.. I won't talk about graphics being ugly because the game is pretty old but in my opinionthey're pretty good but the thing here is how the game is optimized. To be honest it has pretty bad console port. Sometimes it get's unplayable when you get into a larger fight. But you can reduce that to minimum or get rid of it completely by some methods and programs. But my final verdict about this game is 9.5/10 because if it didn't had those problems with optimization I would gladly give it 10/10.","October 18, 2014","true","36.6"," 21 of 27 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","21","27","0","0"

But I was really surprised at how awesome this game is. In the first hour of the game I witnessed a samurai ninja gang member run after and attack a female streaker who was running around taunting people, followed by a guy walking around in a hotdog costume. On top of this, I discover a song by my favorite band on one of the in game radio stations. At this point, this was already an awesome game and I enjoyed most of my time playing it.\n\nIn this game you play as the leader of the Saints, the same character from the first game, and you have to take over the city of Stilwater once again from three new gangs. Each gang had unique, well written generals and leaders, and the boss fights with them were quite interesting, though in some cases frustrating because of iffy controls. There was lots of humor in the game, some of it unintentional, but this really helped the game stand apart from the standard GTA formula.\n\nI had few issues with the game apart from the two or three annoying bosses. Most of the cars are really bad to drive in, either slow, or bad handling. I stuck to a police car for most of the game. Fast, and turns well. I also had problems with checkpoints forcing me to redo entire missions after something like an apache helicopter appears out of nowhere and I can't avoid it and die. This gets annoying but overall, it didn't hurt the overall gameplay.\n\nThe best thing about this game is that it's fun. There's a lot of wacky stuff in here, like driving around in a septic truck and spraying houses and stuff to lower property values and whatnot. This game is unique and memorable, and I think I enjoyed the game more than GTA. And this is only the beginning. From what I've heard, the games just get wackier and more epic from this point, but this was an excellent starting point for me, since I can't really play the first Saints Row.\n\nTL;DR\nThis game is fun, unique, the story is strong, and the characters are memorable.

So I bought it, started it up, and was excited to play quite possibly the best SR game on PC. After having to click through the main menu using only my arrow keys (no mouse support on the title screen), I was finally able to start the game. The graphics seemed a bit bad when compared to the console versions, but I wasn't going to let graphics stop me from playing. So I created my custom character, and after watching the following cutscene, all of my hope of this being a good PC port officially sank.\n\nAs soon as I was allowed to move around (after the cutscene you have to break out of jail), I noticed that everything was moving faster than it should have been: character movements, their animations, you name it (though the sound effects were still normal). This makes the game nearly impossible to play-since it's so hard to aim weapons and driving is incredibly awkward (on a side note, they didn't even bother to change the weapon change pop-up from the Xbox version, click). Why exactly is the game like this? Well that's because when Volition ported SR2 from Xbox to PC, they didn't bother optimizing the CPU speed for it (SR2's is about 3.2 Ghz) so that it could work well with the CPU speed for most computers (source, see IdolNinja's 4th post). To put it in English, while it'll run perfectly fine on the Xbox, it'll run like crap on most PCs (this "speed-up" glitch happens on both Windows 7 and 8). If you think I'm the only one with this problem, check the community hub for this game and you'll see that tons of people have the same problem.\n\nNow I've heard that there is a way this can be fixed by using an external mod known as Gentlemen of the Row, but that's beside the point. The fact that I'm forced to restort to an external mod to fix a game that should have already been fixed is just ridiculous. If you want to play Saints Row 2, pick up an Xbox or PS3 version. Do not waste your time on this lackluster PC port.","April 13, 2014","false","1.0"," 80 of 139 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","80","139","0","0"

While Saints Row 3 and 4 run smoothly at 60 frames per second, Saints Row 2 regulary drops to ~30 fps. While 30 fps wouldn't make it unplayable, the constant frame rate fluctuation does. The only "solution" I've come across so far is capping the frame rate through a third party tool.\n\nWhile it is playable with an Xbox 360 controller, it is poorly implemented. Whenever a message pops up telling you which button to press, it shows you the keyboard keys -- really stupid, since the game was originally released on Xbox 360 (the mod "Gentlemen of the Row", among other things, fixes this issue and is generally recommended). Should you have played Saints Row 3/4 before Saints Row 2 and you want the same button mapping on your 360 controller for this one, you're out of luck due to conflicting button functions (you end up shooting and accelerating in your car at the same time).\n\nThis game needed a lot of patching, but support for this abomination of a port was quickly stopped -- leaving not only a broken game, but also a complete lack of DLC (which is available on the console versions).\n\nDon't buy this port, no matter how cheap it is or how much you like the other Saints Row games.\n\n**NOTE TO GERMAN PLAYERS: The German version is heavily(!) censored, making it even more terrible.**","July 8, 2014","false","1.7"," 16 of 22 people (73%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","73","16","22","2","0"

This game plays and feels like GTA, for me it was like a mix between San Andreas and Vice City, and this is actually a good thing since it combined the best parts of both games.\n\nOn the other hand, the side activities and the not very smooth driving controls can get really frustrating at times, I found myself raging at a good number of side activities and unfortunatley killed my desire to go for 100% completition, that being said, I got so hooked onto this game I actually marathoned through it, it was really addictive\n\nHowever, the side activities and the "respect" system made the game annoying at times, makes me appreciate the devs for implementing a proper RPG-ish leveling system for the sequels as it made every single activity fun to play on my own terms, unlike this game where you are forced to do side activities if you want the right to continue the story\n\nDespite everything, this was a great game, left me with a sweet taste in my mouth, would love to revisit again sometime","January 18, 2015","true","26.3"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","11","14","0","0"

Some days ago I saw SR 2 here on Steam and thought "Awesome, I gotta get it!"... but than I read all the bad reviews about it´s poor optimizing for PC which I all experinced myself:\n\n(Instant) crashes, poor controls for gamepads (which really is unbelievably annoying), censoring and some acetous lags appearing while driving. It also runs faster than it should do, which is also verified by other reviewers here.\n\nIt was reduced to 2,50€, so I gave it a try. I tried to fix it with the Gentleman of the Row Mod but it didn´t work for me.\nI didn´t want to give it up yet. I searched the internet for every possible solution... I almost gave up until a friend of mine suggested the uncut patch.\n\nThe thing is, since I use this patch, the lags while driving still appear (and are still displeasing),it doesn´t make the controls for gamepads lovelier and it still feels and probably runs faster than it should, but it does not crash ANYMORE (at least on my laptop, WIN8) like it used to do and you have it all uncut without any blackscreens hiding you a lot of humorous and sarcastic cutscenes! It´s also not a hell of a work to install this uncut patch.\n\nI played the first 3 missions to realize how awesome and fun this game is, so it was worth the research. It´s not flawless, perfect and quintessential as a PC port, sure not, however, I recommend it to all the SR lovers to get this experience, in my openion it´s worth it!! I would even buy it for 10€ again, if I had to, with all it´s technical flaws.\n\nI think it´s up to you how much patience you can gather to handle this buggy monstrous mess of a PC port.\n\nIt´s a beautful disaster so to say...","January 25, 2014","true","27.7"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","0"

This is the WORST port of the BEST game I have ever seen.\n\nSaint's row is a game most of us have come to know fitting the genre with games like GTA, Mafia, Batman Arkham, and even Just Cause. Saints Row 2 takes a serious approach to gang violence as you play the leader of "The Saints". Your goal is essentially to defeat all opposition to your gang so you can rule the city. To do so you need to so many side-activities to earn "respect", as each main mission requires one full bar of respect to play. Sounds fun in essence, but why does it not cut the bill on PC?\n\n-The main character turns like an elephant trying to find a pimple on its butt. I hold A to go left, and my guy runs forward off of a cliff and I die and mission failed. Thanks SR2, thanks.\n-The Co-op is just horrible (Note, it can only be played through LAN). The two players are consistently out of sync with each other. So Player 1 is constantly speeding ahead of Player 2. Player 1 may not even notice if he rams Player 2's car, sending him flying off a cliff. Player 2 can't shoot out of a car worth ♥♥♥♥ because the enemies are teleporting around, syncing to Player 1 and then desyncing to player 2. It has to have been the worst co-op experience I have ever played through. The host of the sessions always seemed to crash after an hour or two (we switched to test if it was maybe just one of us, but no this is a LAN bug.)\n-The AI isn't worth mentioning. They're extremely buggy in some missions. IE: Rocketeers that spawn directly in your face and blow you up instantly. Groups of enemies spawning right next to you while you are already fighting.\n-The Driving mechanics are the worst driving mechanics I have seen in any game in my life. Getting over the fact that you can't drive in a straight line down the street to save your life unless you get a lucky angle. The AI drivers have no sense of how driving actually works and are constantly causing accidents, tend to forget you even exist and simply ram you out of the blue. Note the driving is much worse in co-op once you add in all the desync. OH, and not to forget how many times I've held "W" to go forward and my guy just straight up stopped moving for no reason until I pressed W again.\n-Some weapons are very unresponsive to when you shoot them. Especially the Deagles. I have to click 4 times just to get one of them to shoot when I'm dual-wielding.\n-Many of the side-activites have glitches. For example in the "brawling" side activity, there's a bug my friend and I ran into where we kept falling over onto the ground for no discernable reason every couple of minutes.\n-The graphics are dated. While that means nothing to me, I know plenty of gamers are willing to pass right over a game if it doesn't have beautiful modern graphics. If you're one of them, avoid this game. The draw distance is sub-par due to the age of this game, the character models are on par with "The First Templar", and the textures are pathetic by today's standards.\n-The sounds aren't all that great, and they're buggy on top of that. There are many times where the sound glitches out and you hear a loud repeating gunshot for the next 20 minutes or until you exit the game.\n+Luckily, the story of the game really still holds up, so if you can get past all the many problems this has, you still have a well written story awaiting you in this game.\n+The dialogue is also well written and entertaining to hear and read.\n+The voice acting is done well, but it's nothing to brag about.\n\nI give this port a lowly 3.5/10 (Which I think is generous due to its problems.) It was something I had to force myself to finish, even with the few enjoyable aspects it had. I'd recommend you stay away from this port as if you life depended on it. Get a console version, or a GoG version. It's a shame steam would release something as broken as this game. Stay away.","June 4, 2015","false","20.2"," 13 of 20 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","13","20","0","1"

Lots of violence, which treads the line between funny and horrifying. Your character is an unapologetic ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, which would suck in any other game, but here it's made fun. There are tons of sidemissions which you have to complete to get Respect for story missions and each Activity's premise is hilariously idiotic. The witing is equally great in all the cutscenes and it's just a delight to watch them. The licensed OST is rather good, with the highlight for me being flying around in a helicopter and exploding a rival gang's vehicles to the sound of The Subway's Rocknroll Queen. While we are on the matter of vehicles, they look great and some are VERY fast, but they handle like ♥♥♥♥. When you get to the third or fourth mission of the Ronin, my advice is to spawn a helicopter with a cheat before you start, because there's always ONE biker that gets away. The regenerating health system is rather ♥♥♥♥ in this case, which is why I sometimes used the full health cheat. Another gripe I have is the driver AI, even members of your own gang will slam their car in yours when you're speeding somewhere.\n\nBut, overall it's a great game with a somewhat ♥♥♥♥♥♥ port (done by CD Projekt no less) and I reccommend it to anyone who wants a great, self-aware gangster story.

Unfortunately, this port constantly crashes for me, even after following tweaking guides and using the vastly recommended 'Gentlemen of the Row' patch.  The patch adds great features, like supposed stability tweaks that didn't work for me, in-game PS3/360 button prompts, and additional clothing/walking/customization options that were already in the game but isn't available for the player to access otherwise.  Sadly, what this patch does for this port is what should have done by the developers in the first place.  I just find it extremely unfortunate that such a great game suffers from such a terrible port.\n\nOverall recommendation: If you feel like tweaking the game and are ready to grab a refund if it doesn't work for you; go for it.

In other words, it was nauseating and almost unplayable. Even the games controls can feel wonky and/or hyper sensitive at times. The core gameplay is the same mind you, but the general performance basically kills the entire experience.\n\nSo until this game is patched to work with modern operating systems, computers components, and has a general preformance overhual I just can't recommend this game.\n\nEdit: I would like to also add that this version of Saints Row 2 is a compatability issues nightmare and was an overall headache to just get running in the first place.","July 20, 2014","false","27.4"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","73","8","11","3","0"

Having played all of the SR games on PC, if I had to pick a favorite it would be The Third. This game is a little weaker mechanically, and can take a lot of effort to even get running. Even more to get it running without the cutscenes bugging out. The guns feel wimpy at times, especially the pistols. The customisation is the most in-depth of any SR game, and if you just ignore it you aren't enjoying all this game has to offer. The story is absolutely superb, and very dark. Sadly, the low quality audio files in this port can ruin some moments. Co-Op is a blast provided you get it to work. The AI both realistically and frustratingly realize they are rolling around in two-ton bullets, and kill you very quickly on higher heat levels.\n\nTL:DR; The game has problems, most of which stem from being a bad port and are being worked on by both the modding community and the developers in their spare time. The story is entertaining but there are some balance issues. Customisation is utterly unrivaled by any crime sandbox game on the market today, except for potentially Saints Row IV.","January 11, 2014","true","31.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

Infact I'd say it was the main reason I bought an xbox 360 and all the experiences I had I'll cherish for the rest of my life.\n\nHowever, I will be the first to admit this game has not aged well by any stretch of the imagination. The animation work is simply amazingly bad, the voice acting is terrible and the modelling work is simplistic. However, the game world still features a significant amount of depth. With numerous collectables and secret areas that litter the landscape of Stilwater. The player character customization was only reduced in SR3 to put it into perspective.\n\nThe biggest problem with this game today is the PC port, which is today known as the worst PC port in the history of gaming. You would normally require an extensive knowlege with hex editors inorder to run the game natively. But thankfully the modding community has released "Gentlemen of the Row" which fixes pretty much all the problems and even adds functionality to the game that didn't previously exist in the 360/PS3 release.

For example, during drug trafficking activities where you need to protect the drug dealer, the AI drives vehicles to a meeting point but usually just crashes into cars along the way, damaging the vehicle.\n\nOverall Score: 6.5/10\n\nA fun game but not without serious flaws.","January 6, 2014","true","69.6"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","0"

Following on from 5 years after the events of the original game, you set about trying to reinstate the Third Street Saints gang as the occupiers of the city of Stillwater. With the main story progression slowly wiping out the rival gangs, there are lots of smaller side missions that allow you to earn respect from your gang and the citizens of Stillwater. The hyperrealistic gameplay and humerous jokes make the game enjoyable to play, allowing to relax and zone out after a long day at the office.\n\nI've seen many reviews complaining about this being a bad port, however I have had no issues that are really worth mentioning.\n\nPros:\n+ Open world environment allowing exploration and free play\n+ Customizable character, goons, vehicles, and cribs\n+ Enjoyable main story, with plenty of fun and comical side misssions\n+ Hyperrealistic gameplay adds to the humour and atmosphere of the game\n+ Fantasic set of characters with nice dialogue and voice acting\n+ Enjoyable cutscenes to watch\n\nCons:\n- Helicopters are so hard to control!\n- No achievements\n- Potential optimization problems (I didn't experience any though)\n\nMy Score: 7/10","August 19, 2015","true","35.5"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Quite unexpectedly, the choice fell on Saints Row 2. And I thought: why and ... yes!\n\nA little of everything\n\n▶Gameplay\n\n●Gameplay Saints Row 2 does not try to surprise us with what some innovations, it is - a typical sandbox in the best tradition of the series Grand Theft Auto. The plot is supplied via cutscenes and markers with the symbols of a particular gang indicate the transition to missions. Speaking of missions, a little not clear logic of their location on the map. For example, the "icon" of the mission may be somewhere in the suburbs of Stillwater, a cutscene will take you back to the "den" Saints gang.\n\n●But this stuff, let's talk about the more unpleasant things. Namely, the authority of the protagonist. To access the missions, you need to constantly maintain its credibility, which is very quickly get bored. There are several variations of "pumping" of authority. The easiest and most obvious - the implementation of various podrabotok. But we fatty Spaniards are not looking for the easy way and so after each mission, drive around and shoot villains from enemy gangs under the composition of such legends of hip-hop scene as Run DMC, Nas and Apache.\n\n●Soundtrack in Saints Row 2 is presented in the form of various radio stations broadcasting music for all tastes - from classical to "heavy music".\n\n▶Graphics and physics\n\n●For Saints Row 2 was designed a special game engine, clearly requires treatment file. In the case of the physics engine decided not to show off and took Havok.\n\n●Game development company engaged Volition, Inc, which gave us such games as Red Faction and The Punisher. Regarding the latter, I would like to note the similarity of character design.\n\n●It is worth noting that the game slows down. Always. On any graphics settings. And this despite the fact that no high poly models or qualitative reflections or textures in HD, it does not shine. The exceptions are the happy owners of certain (what is - you need to find out an educated bet) graphics cards from NVIDIA. In the case of ATI all very badly, just like in Saints Row: The Third. Still consistency - not always a sign of excellence.","March 30, 2015","true","1.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"

This is really the best in the Saints Row franchise, with a multitude of activities and a 30+ hour long campaign that doesn't shove mini-games down your throat. This game mixes the realism from Saints Row 1, and throws in a lot of wackiness, making this game the perfect blend of realism and extreme fun that everyone really looks for in a game. Coming out at the same time as GTA 4 had its problems, since it'd be its biggest competitor. But I bought this game instead of GTA a long time ago and I have yet to regret it. It has a few problems on PC, but the experience is still there, and it's still great. Especially with a friend.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DrinkBleachBB/recommended/9480/","DrinkBleachBB","King_Bushie","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DrinkBleachBB/","134 products in account","This, in my opinion, is the BEST Saints Row game out of the few I've played-SR IV, SRTT, SR2-.\nThis game has the best story out of the Saints Row games I've played, and has the best map out of any SR games I've played. Note: this review will have spoilers.\nPros:\nThe map may not be the largest map of any open world sandbox game I've played, but it's one of the best, just under GTA V's in explorability-in my ♥♥♥♥♥♥ little opinion-. I've played over 170 hours of it, and I'm still finding new locations and secrets.\nUnlike SRTT, the game encourages exploration to find secret areas and secret CD's that you can collect for extra tracks on your custom playlists for the radio, and to unlock new outfits for every 10 you find.\nSRTT's map, in my opinion, is too bland and industrial, just a boring city. Steelport is boring, honestley-and the map was reused in SR IV which sucks major ♥♥♥-. Stilwater-WITH ONE 'L', ♥♥♥♥♥♥- is actually  reused, but because of-SPOILERS- Ultor fixing up the city, it looks different than what I've seen of SR1's version of Stilwater.\nIt's pedestrians are varied, and they have different spawns for different areas. In SRTT, the peds don't stand out and are boring.\nThe story is great, showing how-SPOILERS- the boss is a ♥♥♥♥ing socipathic killer, and will ♥♥♥♥ up anybody in his/her way. He ruins the lives of his enemies, cripples them, buries them alive, ruins family relationships, kills their loved ones. One scene legitemetley makes me ♥♥♥♥ing terrified, and is one of my greatest fears,-SPOILERS-, being buried alive.\nThere's plenty of customization option to make your little man/woman pretty. Under shirts, over shirts, coats, eyewear, different singular piercings, TEETH, ♥♥♥♥ING, EYES-if you get GoTR-, pants, underwear, SOCKS-THAT HIGHLY DETAILED-, and shoes. You can change the colors of all of them, make them look different, different styles to wear them and how they look. It's the best feature in the game\nThe music is great, and I usually play with it off, but I'd reccomend keeping it on and listening to the radio.\nThe food/drug wheel makes a return from SR1, but has much more limited options than in the last game, and it's a visual effect. Drugs used to give you different abilities while making your damage intake lower, but your screen more covered in smoke. Beer would make you vomit-if you consumed too much-, and would make your vision blurry, but your melee damage would be heavily increased. Food gave you health. Now it's just visual for the drugs and beer, no actual upgrades given. Food still heals though.\nThe missions are fun, for the most part.\n\nBut with the amazingly kick-♥♥♥, must come the bad.\n\nCons:\nIt's PC port is a DISASTER, and I reccomend a mod to fix all the bugs, add new weapons, and 2 of the few DLC missions ported over-GoTR-.\nIt's graphics seem a bit outdated, but I don't really mind it.\nEven for 2008, the draw distance is horrible.\nSome missions have a time limit, and those seem to be the most tedious ones.\nEven with the Gentlemen of The Row mod, if you get over 30 FPS items float away from charecters in cutscenes, or are just a bit off. I can't really describe it.\nWith the 2 DLC missions ported over-Corporate Warfare and the other one I can't remember- with GoTR, they're unfinished, which I can't blame them for, and even on the consoles it's a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ending to a big part of what happened in SR1 at the end of the game. You ♥♥♥♥ing get blown up on a yacht, Dex, Troy, and Julius ♥♥♥♥ed you over. With the Corporate Warfare DLC Dex re-appeared and you got to do some ♥♥♥♥. Now, it ended in a ♥♥♥♥ing horrid way, with Dex just getting on his plane from the airport, and flying away.-SPOILERS- But there is actually clarifacation on what happened to Dex, his plane crashed in Steelport, you can see it in SRTT and SR IV, and he died.\nThe ending seems a bit to happy from what I expect of SR, in SR1 you got blown the ♥♥♥♥ up, in SRTT theres an option to-spoilers- let Shaundi die and you go to kill Killbane, which is the ending I prefer. In SR2 you basicially take over the city and boom. Hardly anyone ♥♥♥♥ing died. Yeah, Aisha died, Carlos died, Gat got stabbed and was in the hospital for a while, Shaundi got kidnapped by Veteran Child, who you kill, but, it seemed a bit to happy for what I expected.-I played SR IV first, then SR TT, and then SR2.-\n\nOverall, with the GoTR mod, I give this game a 8/10, a great game. Now, I installed the mod off the bat, so I can't give a rating for the unmodded game. But, yeah, this game is the best SR game in my opinion, and if you haven't bought/played it yet, it's only 10 bucks, and it's worth much more than that.","September 18, 2015","true","243.6"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","80","4","5","3","0"

You'll need the Gentlemen of the Row mod too because it fixes the bad port's problems but even then I still have had the game randomly crash at times. Overall the game is good, but its not nearly as fun as 3 and 4. Sure Stillwater is more interesting to explore and there's more customization options but the combat is rather bland. You only get crazy weapons until towards the end of the game so you're stuck with your standard sandbox arsenal and none of them really feel satisfying. Also its kind of feels like the series didn't find its identity yet and SR2 tries to balance being serious and silly and it doesn't really work.

The game lacks optimization, if you use anything above a 3.0ghz CPU then you will find everything to be 2x faster and this can only be solved by either downloading a software or lowering your CPU clock down to 3.0 if you have it overclocked. The driving in this game is exceptionally raging, at times I have had to restart missions  because the vehicles would just handle very badly and sometimes stearing myself into objects/buildings and blowing the car up, especially at high speeds. The framerates are horrible even though I have a multi-core CPU my framerates stutter a lot, this is most noticable when driving and so far I haven't found a solution to this. I feel as if the developers didn't take enough time to optimize it because most of the games controls feel very awkward.

Numerous weapons lying around, squishy mortals to use them on, and side missions with the most creative ideas in them. While SR2 is quite similar to a GTA game, there are some core differences. The most obvious one is that, while GTA likes to downplay the inherent anarchy that flourishes within the game, Saint's Row embraces it, and lets you go nuts. For example, the notoriety mechanic. If, at any point, you find yourself surrounded by members of a rival gang, you can choose to begin firing randomly at civilians, by which point cops will come running and take the thugs off your hands. Another example is the cars. Saint's Row 2 completely ignores physics for these bits, and just lets you go wild, smashing through groups of pedestrians with not even a scratch on you.\nMaybe there's some irony in an insane game that knows that it's insane, but I can't really care.

Mouse and keyboard controls basically function (with correct prompts), and it has graphics options, but the performance is all over the place and throws the physics with it. Raw machine power doesn't seem to enter into it: even the end credits scroll can't run smoothly. Some activities (like using the tow truck) will be pure hell.\n\nHowever, it's also a great game. The writing is strong again, and it's actually got a lot more to it than SR3 or 4. A lot. The city is more varied, more alive (for example, skateboarding pedestrians), and there are a whole heap of entertaining activities. You get to see why Gat is cool, rather than just being told he is. Shaundi is actually likable. Vehicles actually handle distinctly, at least when the physics engine isn't choking to death. There're nice touches like a noticeboard to let you replay past missions and even a TV to rewatch cutscenes in your new duds. If, like me, you started on SR3 and wondered why some people were bemoaning its reduced scope, this game is the explanation. SR3 feels a little more distilled, but this is the bigger, badder game. Between this and 4, well, I lost interest halfway through 4 to focus on this.\n\nIf only Volition's paymasters would assign them to actually fix or remake it properly. Call it an "HD" re-release if you must; it'd certainly beat another Enter the Dominatrix.\n\nAs it is, if you buy it you're taking a gamble. Good payoff, but a risk it'll be unplayable for you.

Still sillier that GTA which it was supposed to be just a "clone" of, yet with just as strong a story line. Yes, there's ridiculous moments, and really funny ones, but there's also moments that make you realise that the city of Stilwater and the life of the Saints is not all sunshine and smiles.\nThis is still one of my favourite games, I continue to come back to it every so often. I do prefer it to the later editions of the series, where they just took the "silly", gimmick-y route, and left out the meaningful storyline, as I saw it.\nI would definitely recommend this game to any of the fans of the Saint's Row franchise.\nGraphically it is a bit dated, and the controls on the PC are fairly clunky, but I would say to overlook that in favour of the quality of the writing, voice acting and general fun of the game.\nOh, and I would also recommend grabbing the GotR mod for this, as it does help the game immensely.","January 1, 2014","true","55.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

There's a ton of help out there, though, originating from THE go-to source for such info (AKA Idolninja and his Saints Row Mods site) for getting the game to run normally under Win7, so honestly, this wasn't even *slightly* a problem.  Just a few tweaks according to instructions and the game was running perfectly.\n\nThat said, there absolutely isn't a reason I can think of to give Saints Row 2 a pass, other than maybe if you still have the (very depressing) combination of severely outdated PC hardware plus ancient operating system.  A modern OS, a modern CPU and moderately speedy RAM all go REALLY far in mitigating any poor performance due to the badly-done port of this game.\n\nAlso, having finished Saints Row 4 recently (finally!), I can hands-down say that Saints Row 2 is STILL the best Saints Row of the series.  Sure, the graphics aren't pretty, but did you know there are SweetFX mods out there that beautifully fix this quibble?  There totally ARE, so get this game already if you haven't yet, okay?  Okay!\n\n-------\nOriginal review below:\n\nThe PC port notoriously buggy, but if you're lucky, you might get away with not having any showstopping bugs, like me!  It worked fine out of the box, and I'm on some old hardware with an ancient OS (XP).  There's a veritable TON of info out there to fix or minimize the game's bugs (look up the guy named IdolNinja, he's a Saints Row magician), so even if you do have issues, with a bit of tweaking, the game may well run fine for you too.\n\nIf you started with Saints Row the Third and want to know some of the Saints' backstory, this is a must-have game.  GET IT GET IT GET IT!  Especially when it's on one of those mega sales where you can get it for $3.74 or so!","July 20, 2013","true","194.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mmelvin/recommended/9480/","mmelvin","Jesus Crust!","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mmelvin/","101 products in account","This is Saints Row 2, and this is the only time I've ever driven backwards down the sidewalk tossing grenades out the window listening to Culture Club. For the first time in my life, actually experiencing true contentedness (until the game crashed).\n\nFirst things first: This is a bad port. It's going to crash sometimes, default controls feel a bit like they were slapped together by someone who's never actually used a keyboard, apparently some players are experiencing their games playing at faster speeds than what the game should, the game will stutter here and there, but does this render the game completely unplayable, and does Volition deserve packages of poo delivered to them in the mail?\n\nIt could, and possibly.\n\nIn the forty-ish hours I've played this game, it's crashed five times. I haven't narrowed down why it does this; it just happens at random. Driving down the sidewalk, outdoors on foot, during missions, not during missions, and one time in the mallwhen I found a little UFO and promptly crashed 10 feet away.\n\nAnd praise Jesus, for the controls are changeable. Whoever said the F key should be weapon zoom, I hate you, and I bet you're the same turdhound who did it in Red Faction: Guerilla. Seriously. F? You get an F. And the stuttering, for me, with my Frankenstein-like PC, was not a constant. Sometimes it would seem like the car I was driving would stop for a trillionth of a second. It's noticeable, but not game breaking. Just annoying. As for that speed-up issue, I have no idea what that's about. Hasn't happened to me.\n\nNow, to actually review the game. Saints Row 2 has been the most fun I've had playing a game in a really, really long time. In fact it's the first game over twenty hours long that I've actually completed the main story beginning to end. I bought it during the Saints Row free weekend at around 9pm. I ended up playing clear into morning, went to class, then came home and almost started it back up again. But, you know, sleep and all that.\n\nGraphically, Saints Row 2 is both amazing and boring at the same time. Some parts of Stilwater are fantastically detailed while others are pretty bland (but that's true of real life cities, so I guess that point's a bit moot), cars will look different depending on their paint jobs, blood goes flying when you go on murder sprees, trees look like trees, etc.\n\nThere will be hilarious glitches, too. Phones will be stuck to fingertips, one NPC's helmet will be off by half a head (hilarious scene, by the way, made even more hilarious because of the glitch), traffic will flip out (literally), and lots of other funny, not game-breaking stuff. I once had a pedestrian get caught in my windshield. His legs were flopping around at the top of the car as I was avoiding the police. Hilarious.\n\nYour character, The Boss, on the other hand, is going to look a bit strange. What I mean is you're going to be able to tell you made him, and not the same guy who modeled the other main characters. My first character, before really taking my time at the plastic surgeon, looked like this. Absolutely horrifying. Eventually, she became a man, then I finally settled on this, so, it is possible to make a character that doesn't look like she can chew through your ribcage and eat your soul, just take your time and eventually you’ll get something you like.\n\nGameplay-wise, Saints Row 2 has taken what’s worked in other games and stuck right to it. The game plays very well (once you get used to that stutter I mentioned earlier). Control-wise, you'll need to play in the options menu for a bit to get the camera movement speed how you like it, and you'll have to figure out how to rebind your keys, but once you get all set up how you like it, you won't have any problems.\n\nVehicle movement may be too sensitive for some people. They didn't take into account W, A, S, and D isn't exactly the same as a control stick, so vehicle control may feel over-sensitive. Helicopters will make you not want to use helicopters. They whip around while turning and when you're trying to stop, they wobble around and then suddenly flip over, crash into a building, get stuck on something and explode.\n\nAs you're running around town you can carry one of each type of weapon: Pistol, shotgun, rifle, submachine gun, grenades, and a special weapon, and whatever type the rocket launcher falls into. You also have food in your inventory, and I've been carrying around the same burgers since I started up the game because I never found out how to eat the damn things. You can dual-wield pistols and submachine guns, and also use those two weapons while driving to fire out the window at whoever might be minding their own business while you drive by.\n\nThe game map is spattered with things to do. You have the main story missions, then you have what are called Activities. These can be anything from stealing ho's from pimps to driving around on an ATV in a fire suit, setting people on fire. Each activity has six levels, and there are two different locations per activity. Each activity gives some kind of reward, like improved accuracy, damage resistance, faster healing. All very useful, and I wish I knew that before I jumped into the main story missions, because that infinite sprint is really handy. The activities also give you Respect, a stat that determines whether or not you can even do the story missions.\n\n\nCompleting missions and activities reward you money, costumes, cars, bonuses, etc. Eventually you'll find yourself with tons and tons of cash, which you can use to buy stuff to customize your character, trips to the gun store, car dealer, plastic surgeon, and other places. You can buy real estate, and from that you'll have cash deposited in your stash's safe that you can pick up each game day.\n\nThere is so much to do in this game that if you get bored, either you've already done everything, or you just don't like the game. This is also one of those games where you can take a break from the game without shutting it down and playing something else. Tired of missions? Go see how long you can survive with your notoriety at five stars. Do some activities like finding the car races around the city or hop in a septic truck and give hundreds of people E. coli. Suffering through those helicopter missions might bring your interest back to other missions!\n\nThe actual story of Saints Row 2 is alright. I don't want to ruin anything, but there are some memorable things involving monster trucks and boats. I've already mentioned the story is about you leading the Saints to retake the city of Stilwater. It starts off with a prison break, and from there you can go after each gang however you want.\n\nI first went after the Ronin, then the Brotherhood, then the Sons of Samedi. The Ronin are your stereotypical asian gang: Tuner cars, motorcycles, katanas, disappointing sons. The Brotherhood is your stereotypical truck-lovin', mullet-rockin' trailer trash, and the Sons of Samedi: Crazy voodoo-practicing "Caribbeans". Finally you take on Ultor, who has lots of money, its own private security force, and its own private army. Fun times.\n\nSaints Row 2, if it actually works for you (I'm sure you can think of a clever way to find that out), is definitely worth its $10.00 price tag if you don't have a chance to pick it up on sale. You will not get bored any time soon if you get this game (unless it craps out on you, in which case put that crap in a box and mail it to the developer).","February 4, 2015","true","39.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

All I know is that it worked fine on my computer and I really enjoyed it.\nI played the third before this one and it was funny to see what happened before the goings on of the third. Seeing old characters in the new (or old depending on your perspective) city of Stillwater was pretty amusing as well. In terms of graphics, plotline and general quality: sure, it’s not as good as the third game, but for what it is, it is still pretty great.\nWhereas it’s sequel is a lot more on the light hearted and jokey side, this game was a lot more serious and gruesome in terms of plot and dealing with the enemies, which was a little bit of a shock to me if I’m honest but it doesn’t make the game any less good.\nThe cars, their mechanics and physics all work well and the music and charm of the game as a whole is still worth the money.\nIf you are looking to start the franchise or already are a fan of the franchise and are looking to back track a little, do it!","July 6, 2012","true","39.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

If you haven't played the first one you should be ok (I never played the first one) the game does a good job telling you what happened, and I never felt lost story wise. However, there were some times when I felt that they referenced the first game, but it only felt like if my friends had an inside joke that I wasn't part of. Overall, the story was good, and I understood it. If you are coming at this after playing futer installments, you will notice that the tone is way different. It is much more serious and in many cases really brutal like when you are taking out key members of a rival gang. However, there is still tons of humor. Good examples being, driving around in a septic truck shooting sewage at houses to lower the property value, you and Pierce's arguments about which radio station to watch, the character interactions in general, and the news and advertisements that play on the radio. A thing that the game does really well at is the side missions. There is a huge variety of them from standard ones like stealing cars to the previously mentioned spraying buildings with sewage to lower the property value. Another thing that the game does well is the story progression. You have the freedom to really do what you want to do from the very begining. You can pick which gang mission you want to do, if you want to topple one before the other, or if you want to try to attack them all at the same time. However, my biggest problem is that there was a few more glitches than I would have liked, but I only had to restart once, and I crashed twice. Other than that the game was well designed, and all around a blast to play.","January 1, 2015","true","19.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","2","2","2","0"

It is NOT a GTA clone, but it does have similarities. I have played this game from start to finish as well as many activities and other fun things. May I just say one main thing SR2 does better  than GTAV:\nGTAV activities include: Tennis, Yoga, Strip clubs, Drinking, Golf, etc\nSR2 activities include: Mayhem (where you have to cause as much damage as possible), Insurance fraud (throw yourself into cars to go flying and make money), Fight Club, Attack Helicopter (covering a drug-dealing car from above), Snatch (Oh, how this mode made me cry in my (successful) attempt at getting infinite ammo for the SMG's...), and many more fun and destructive activities. Granted, the SR series does not have as much 'polish', but I still think it is much more fun.\nIn this game you could be holding an innocent bystander after chucking a sticky bomb on a train. You can then throw this person infront of the train (as it passes), detonate the bomb so the train de-rails and sends itself and the person (and probably multiple cars) flying off a bridge and falling into the sea. All in the space of about a second. There are a hell of a lot of things you can do in this game, all as insane and fun as that. Get the bundle which includes this, SR3 & DLC, and SR4 & DLC. That's what I did (got it off ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥) for less than £15 and it has lasted me a long time. Gonna get Gat outta hell when I can :D\n\nProblems though: The cinematics are often out of sync (which really stops any emotion in scenes), The sound quality is often terrible, and often things are out of place (E.G in one scene the phone was stuck on the other side of a guy's hand for me).

Do yourself a favour and get "Gentlemen of the row". It will fix most of the bugs and add some cool new stuff for you to do or you can stay to the vanilla version of the game.

Once the games been "patched" Saints Row 2 can be a blast.\n\nHeres a list of things that you can do in Saints Row 2 that you can't do in 3 and 4\n\n1. A very detailed enviroment\n2. Customizable cribs\n3. Fighting styles\n4. Spray ♥♥♥♥ all over pedestrians and killing them with said ♥♥♥♥\n5. You can eat food (you regen health but eating regens faster, can upgrade health regen by doing activities)\n6. You can smoke\n7. Get drunk\n7.

Diversions\n\nDon't me wrong. Saints Row 3 and 4 are going on a different road. Saints Row 1 and 2 was dark and gritty and "realistic". Saints Row 3 and 4 are both crazy and comedic. It really depends on what you like. If you just want to mess around then I'd say go for Saints Row 2. That's if you are willing to "fix" the game up yourself. If not then Saints Row 3 and 4 are just as good.

These and many other bugs are fixed by the Gentlemen of the Row mod, which also adds a ton of fun and insane content, which I suspect influenced the feel of Saints Row 3 and 4\n\nIt was no graphical powerhouse in its day, but the graphics have held up surprisingly well for a game of it's age.\n\nDespite all the annoying and insane bugs, for me at least it's still the best of all the Saints Row games as long as you install Saints Row Power Tools and Gentlemen of the Row.\n\nWith all it's problems, I cannot recommend this despite how much I enjoy it. If you are not up to installing mods that need calibrating in to get the game running properly, I would tell you to get Saints Row 3 or 4. However, if you feel up to a challenge, by all means go for it.","March 6, 2014","false","123.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The protagonist is one of the most relatable characters I have ever seen in a videogame, and voice acting done by Charles Shaughnessy (voice 1) makes the character soenjoyable to play as.\nThe Saints themselves are an amazing gang that I am more than pleased to be the leader of, with support NPCs also being very likeable.\nAnd of course, this game remembered what GTA forgot, the most important ingredient of any game: fun.

I personally disagree as I feel Saints Row 3 and 4 felt a lot more cohesive and unique to me, not to mention they are insanely fun and awesome games to play with a friend.\n\nSaints Row 2 definitely has its strengths though. The story is really good and well written, surprisingly so for a GTA style game and the cutscenes are really well done. I also love the characters in the game and that was my main reason for getting the game and playing it.\n\nNot a big fan of the models and textures in the game or the washed out look the game has. It looks like someone sucked out the colour from it and I think SR3 and SR4 had far better colour schemes. And obviously the PC port is really badly optimized and very shoddy. Playing this without the Gentlemen Of The Row patch is not recommended.\n\nThe sound quality is terrible as well, but I like the selection of music, especially the amount of 80's tracks.\n\nOverall though it's a good game with a good story and lots of fun to be had if you can get it working. But personally I feel the sequels were much better games.","June 23, 2014","true","79.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The game left a lot of questions, a lot of backstory, so I figured the only way to get answers was to go back to the beginning, or as far as I could.\n\nThere doesn’t seem to be a Saints Row 1 on Steam, so Saints Row 2 will have to do.\n\nThe first thing to note is that the game is buggy as hell.  Right out of the gate the game didn’t work out of the box on Windows 7. I needed to download a special config file to get the window to open non-full screen.  After a lot of fiddling around I was able to get the game going, but anytime the game crashed while playing full screen I had to re-paste the config file in to the correct directory just to get the game to work.  Needless to say the game has issues, and let it be your warning.\n\nI never really felt like the game was probably a good PC port.  I always felt like the controls are some how a bit lacking.  It feels like a console game that’s on a PC that was meant to be played with a gamepad.  The AI is generally horrible, and gives you that “I have to aim with a stick” feeling.  Driving is relatively easy, and not that great of variety as is in later sequels.\n\nLets cut to the brass tacks.  Do you like explosions?  Do you like violence?  Do you like shooting someone in the face and pushing them out the window of a very tall building?\n\nYou will run.  You will kill.  You will drive.  You… will spray sewage on the cops.  This is Saints Row 2.\n\nThe game in many ways is basically the same as the first.  There are different rival gangs that have taken over the city of Stillwater.  This use to be the Third Street Saints turf, but you have been in a comma for a long time after the ending of the first game.  With the help of your crew Gat (the bad ♥♥♥), Pierce (the black homi), and Shandi (the crusty stoner girl) you will battle these gangs over many planned missions laid out with cinematics.  It’s hard to say the story is good, but it contains quite a few twists that do make it into later games.  All faction missions the same basic pattern.  Small missions leading up to boss fights for the head of each faction.  Most boss fights, albeit interesting, are actually pretty easy despite the fact they may not look so in the first place.\n\nCombat is a 3rd person shooter style.  You’re able to loadout a variety of weapons to each of your main weapon slots.  Your main weapons include, melee, pistol, shotgun, smg, assault, special, and thrown.  You can recruit “homies” off the street that will fight will you.  They are basically cannon fodder, another homage to the ♥♥♥♥ poor AI.\n\nThere is a wide array of places to explore in Stillwater.  There are many side activities to do as well if you have the time and patience.  My initial play through consisted of ~22 hours of game play and that was basically doing what I had to get through the faction mission.  In order to do faction missions, you have to earn “respect”, and you do that mostly by doing side activities.  Once you get a level of respect you can then do a faction mission.  Rinse and repeat.  There is considerable amount of content I did not touch and did not explore.  I’d be confident in saying that you could easily double that time.\n\nAs is the Saints way, you can pimp yourself, your crib, your car, and your crew.  Want to be a giant hot dog?  No problem.  Want to be a guy wearing a thong?  OK, weird, but you can.   Want ninja gang members?  Sure. That’s the fun of Saints Row 2, its wacky without being TOO wacky.  Unlike the sequels it seems less playful and more grounded in reality.  There are no real crazy weapons or vehicles.\n\nTLDR; Overall if you’ve played the sequels and are wondering about the back story I would say the game is worth the time.  I’d have a hard time saying the game is great, because it is not, but it was still a satisfying experience and for it’s time I think it was a solid effort.  It feels like a console port, has ♥♥♥♥ poor AI, and crashes like mad, yet is fun.\n","September 10, 2014","true","23.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

Saints Row 3 and 4, and upcomingly, 5 got nothing compared to this. Saints Row 2 was one of the first games I purchased for my XboX back in 2009, and I still am not weary of it to this day. It has the absolute perfect blend of seriousness and comedy. Action and Laughs. You know when the characters are modelled in such a way, that they're just comedic no matter what? The characters are like that, whilst maintaining the bad-assery that comes with running a gang. This game has great controls, the driving is extremely precise, and the gameplay is fantastic. No matter how much of this game you think you've played, you can always play it some more. Maybe to find an easter egg or 5. Or maybe to explore the nuclear facility plants underground sewer tunnel. Or maybe kill mimes in the Stilwater shopping mall by shooting him with your pimp cane. I've clocked countless of hours of fun on this game. Well over 5 years' gaming worth. And I can not recommend this game enough. Honestly. If you and a friend want to have an amazing amount of fun. Purchase this game. However that being said, the game's servers are no longer up, so if you want to play with a friend, you'll need a third party software like Evolve. But believe me, it's worth it.","September 18, 2014","true","14.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

I've played for about a few minutes on the PC edition but the console versions are better unless you have the "Gentlemen Of The Row" mod that fixes the game. Also 125+ hours spent on the Xbox version single player, 10+ hours co-op, 2+ hours multiplayer (which still works)\n\nPros:\n+ Superb graphics even in todays standards\n+120% larger map compaired to the first\n+ Wonderful Soundtrack (My Chemical Romace, Panic! At The Disco, Paramore, Death From Above 1979) (80's, Rock, Electro, Metal, 70's, Reggae, Hip-Hop/Rap, Classical, World, Collage Radio)\n+ Story contains a Prologue, Gangs (Three), an Epilogue, and Extras (DLC and a Secret Mission)\n+The gangs can be completed how ever you want\n+Customisation is a big part of the game (How you dress, body and face modeling, Cribs, tatoos, a walking style???, and different voices)\n+Unlike SR3 this lets you replay missions and watch cutscenes\n+Minigames that are fun\n+ Random Hood fights\n+32 secret areas, 9 homies that help as sidekicks, 42 cars (not counting the regular cars on streets or parked), 5 hidden tracks, 50 walls to spray, 90 shops to own, 11 cribs to own, 80 stunt jumps, 35 barnstorms\n+ Two DLCs on PS3 and Xbox 360 not counting the free one\n+ Mildly active Multiplayer on consoles\n+ Counts how much bullets you put into bodys\n+ Rewards you in game weapons and clothing for playing Side missions and Story Missions\n+Many indoor areas (Either look hard for them or play the story to find them\n+Each District looks different\n+Has a still active community of moders (More music, bug fixes, graphic enhancements)\n\nCons:\n- Will Lag if too much happening on screen\n- No custom soundtrack where you can put your OWN music in unlike the first\n- Hard even on the Casual difficulty\n\nThe story takes place after the first game.\n\nPrologue: Your character wakes up in the Stilwater Prison Infirmary after the final mission of Saints Row. You meet a man named Carlos who tells you that you've been in an coma for almost five years and that the Saints have been taken out by the three new gangs of Stilwater. You then escape the prison via a boat you and Carlos have just stolen. After gunplay on the back of the boat, Carlos shows that Ultor (prevously a clothing company) has taken control as sort of a government to the city. During the second mission we see Jonny Gat, a former saint, about to be given the death penalty. Before that happens though your character frees Jonny and has to get the Saints back together. Insert Pierce, Shaundi, and Carlos. Three new members your character brings into the gang.\n\nGangs: Your character gives these three members different gangs to look after.\nThe Ronin: The Ronin are looked after by Pierce. The Ronin are a Jappenese gang controled by a young man named Shogo. His father, Akuji. later comes into the story after hearing his son is dissapointing him. The Ronin wear black and yellow colours and use samurai swords as melee weapons.\nThe Brotherhood: During the first mission your character and Carlos go to see the Brotherhoods leader, Maero, to make an agreement with both gangs and split Stilwater but, the Stilwater Police show up, abruptly ending the conversation. When back at the Brotherhood's base of opperations, the character and Maero have an arguement over how the deal goes when Maero tells that the Saints take 20% of Stilwater and the Brotherhood taking 80% of the rest.\nThe Sons Of Samedi: Samedi are a group of drug dealers with a famous product named Loa Dust. With a leader called The General, a bodyguard named Mr. Sunshine, and a deadbeat DJ named Veteran Child these guys dress in Jamacian styled clothing and uses Voo-Doo powers.\n\nEpilogue: After the Gangs are taken out the Saints direct their attention to Ultor and try to take them out. This finale is something to look for as I can't give out any information of missions for possible spoilers.\n\n\nIn the end this game is hours of entertainment. I've been playing since 2012 and am still finding new stuff in it. If you still aren't sure, watch Nerdcubed's video on it. 10/10 In My Opinion","July 1, 2015","true","0.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

So jumping straight into Saints Row 2, I wasn't sure what to expect but one of my friends said it was amazing to play in 2 Player Mode.\nHe told me it was a Grand Theft Auto clone that was actually fun to play. Having just bounced off Grand Theft Auto 4 hard, I decided to give this a try and I can happily say this is one of the best 2 player games I've ever played both for the fun shooty shooty gameplay or the huge number of bugs that can take you completely by surprise.\n\nThe title screen didn't fill me with much hope. Music consisting of angry men telling me how much they love to "shoot up" their significant others and any people they seem to be on disagreeable terms with. My hopes started low. GameSpy didn't help matters either. Did people still have to forward ports in 2009?\n\nBut then wow... we got it working... and there is this huge unknown city to explore! with a friend! And we can run over old ladies in golf buggies!\n\nThe Grand Theft Auto'ness of the game shines through from the start. You start off having just recovered from the events of Saints Row 1. You get the chance to customize your character in a ludicrously huge number of ways and, after an escape from a prison island, are then free to explore this huge city. It is then your mission to rebuild the "Third Street Saints" by completing a number of increasingly dangerous missions, taking out rival gang members and running over old ladies in sports cars.\n\nLuckily, you don't have to have played the first game to enjoy playing the second one. The plot of the first game is brought up frequently in conversation during the first few hours of the game though so if you haven't played the first, you can feel a bit left out of the loop at times.\n\nStillwater, the name of the city you have to take over, is full of opportunity for any low life street thug and you better get acquainted with them; Side missions such as drug trafficking, escorting ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s and the like will give you "Respect", the more respect you have, the further you can advance in the plot.\n\nSome of these missions are fantastic. Insurance fraud is one of the best, which involves you and your friend diving in front of traffic in order to rack up money. The insane physics system the game has allows you to pull off some insane stunts too. There is no shortage of side missions to do in this city and all are well thought out and executed.\n\nThe side missions increase in difficulty as you complete them all the way up to Level 6 and you earn prizes for completing them which can be an incentive to do them.\n\nThe main plot is OK. If you are familiar with crime sandboxes like this one, you should know what to expect from this. The main place where the game shines is in its gameplay and the bugs that come along with it.\n\nBugs can range from simple physics bugs, falling through the world into a bottomless void, not being able to enter cars if too many people want to get into the same car, cutscene bugs and finishing missions and ending up half a mile in the ocean for no reason! They are just some of what can happen when playing (at least in co-op anyway, single player I haven't touched)\n\nJust play this game with a friend over your preferred VOIP client of choice. This game is so much more entertaining when you do. It is worth the hassle of setting up. You'll get a good 40 hours of entertainment out of it.\n\nThis game has set my hopes up for Saints Row 3. Saints Row 2 is grounded enough but plays with tongue firmly in cheek. The seriousness of the characters contrast with the wackiness of the game world to create quite the experience. Just grab a friend and enjoy it.","January 23, 2015","true","39.0"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Nobody should buy SR 2 by itself. Why?\n\n1. Graphics are godawful even for its release year, they look simply cheap and severly lacking detail, also they are not optimized for PC, the performance for PCs MULTIPLE TIMES exceeding the requirements is still horrible - the experience in that aspect is similar to that of GTA 4, it is a bad port, which leads to the next point...\n\n2. It is essentially a console game with rushed port - even the UI is screwed, you don't use "up" and "down" but something like "Shift" and "control" to move forth and back in options, etc. also when you switch through weapons and collectibles, it shows on the screen a CONSOLE BUTTON - even that was not changed... check it out - http://i39.tinypic.com/ajpg5z.jpg - holy ♥♥♥♥, how lazy is that?!\n\n3. Even the movement is laughably bad - when you walk, it looks like that your character is something like a toy soldier which is erratically moved around by a baby who plays with it.\n\n4. Vehicle controls require A MOD to be somewhat playable, the sensitivity of turns is off the charts, it is unnecesserely difficult just to keep the car on the road... I have to add - vehicle controls in Saints Row III are absolutely amazing, and it was one of the first things which surprised me, yes, the company did take note of it and made a change for good in their upcoming releases after this failure.\n\n5. To be able to move forth to the next missions of the main story, you are required to do a certain amount of side activities, which by themselves are not bad, however such system is unnecesserely restrictive and can feel like a chore instead of an entertainment.\n\nTo sum up: Saints Row II is low-quality game which is highly overrated by some individuals with very questionable common sense, it does not stand out by anything, it is cliché, without identity, very cheap in value and suffering from a lot of technical and performance issues.\n\nThe only reason why you happen to have this game is if you, just like me, bought the whole Saints Row bundle and if you also happen to be more curious about the story of the series.\n\nForget about this old garbage and move forth to Saints Row III and newer games - Saints Row II is like a dirt and Saints Row III is like the stars - the ascendance which the creators of these series have made is spectacular!","March 6","false","9.5"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","4","6","0","1"

At this point in the franchise, Saints Row still appears to be trying to establish itself as different to GTA, so expect a few stupidly absurd concepts mixed in with a lot of standard "hood rat to gang leader" style gameplay.","November 27, 2013","true","22.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I won't be giving any spoilers to ruin the fun but all I can say is, the player is back! What more could you ask for?\n\nYou will meet a host of familiar characters along the way, adding to the fun if you have played the first game. The mini-games are a ton of hilarious antics that will most certainly crack you up, much better than any of the mini-games in the whole series in my opinion.\n\nWhat I liked most about this game though, is how dark the story was when dealing with the usual 4 gangs the player will meet in a Saints Row game. There is a very good balance between humour and seriousness in this installment so I highly recommend Saints Row 2 to the multitude of people who feel that the series is just made of complete, utter nonsensical writing.","December 23, 2013","true","10.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There is however a really annoying "fast forward" bug that makes the game run really fast which you can fix using SR2 powertools (google it) and you can make it run somewhat normally depending on what value you use, it even works for co-op (doesn't even have to be both players).

I am a big fan of open world/sandbox games and having already played a couple GTA titles on console and pc, I decided to give Saints Row 2 a chance. There were a lot of complaints about how people were having games that were running at faster speed than normal, but I think it is fine for Windows 8. There is a cutscene bug where the game will black screen if you don't skip it, but I found a mod that had a lot of add ons as well as fixed the minor bugs. After that, I gotta say it's one of the few games where I played beginning to end in the span of just two weeks. It's not the longest game in the world, but the story is interesting and captivating, even making me question the motivations behind each character, but also has some comedy sprinkled in. The music was bearable, so I didn't turn off the radio the second I got into any car. The controls aren't the smoothest because it's a port, but again it was fine for me so I won't hold it against them. Overall it was a great experience and I had a lot of fun. If the game is on sale and you like sandbox games, then give Saints Row 2 a shot. I'm sure glad I did.","June 13, 2014","true","27.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

Saints Row 2 is on the edge of reality, with both it's realistic and occasionally, quite silly missions. It's a game, that dosen't require much skill to play, but nonetheless, is great fun. Comparing to the GTA series, where I failed missions quite often, on SR2, I failed on really rare occasions. However, the wide variety of activities and diversions around Stilwater makes the easiness all worthwhile.\nAgain, on the technical side, one can't help but make comparisons with GTA (Mainly San Andreas). There is a much more advanced character customization system, which allows you to change everything from the depth of your character's forehead to his facial expressions. Although the amount of clothing in the game stores might seem small, it is possible to change the colour of the items from an extensive palette of colours. Also, SR2 offers you a wide variety of vehicles, which all, dissapointingly, seem to be pretty much identical in performance. Also, the ingame radio soundtrack is pretty poor. Especially  dissapointing was the 80s hits radio, which only featured a small handful of songs. While the things I listed were just minor issues that may only be annoying for me, there seem to be a few bugs in the game for which I had to find a solution online. Bugs, that don't allow you to progress further in the game without special consultation, are the most dissappealing.\nIn conclusion, Saints Row 2 is a good alternative to the GTA series, with a small hint of a shoot-em-up game. The story might not be as deep and the technical gameplay not as good, but it sure is fun as hell!","December 24, 2013","true","49.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"

Because frankly, it barely has any of those. The story is good enough and the characters can be funny at times, but none of them match the squad members of Mass Effect or the compnions in Dragon Age. They also fall short of the characters presented in the game's comptetitor, Grand Theft Auto IV. But if you're looking for hours of open-world mayhem, then Saints Row 2's gameplay will definitely satisfy you - perhaps even more so than GTA. The character creation and customization (as well as vehicle customization) is great.

Your partners are there to complement and support you, but you're the true force behind things.\n\nIf someone crosses you (and there will be several of those unfrotunate chaps), you will deal them a terrible and grisly punishment.\n\nIf you ever wanted to feel like a proper, dangerous gangster that no one is safe from - Saints Row 2 can offer that.

The brilliant "Gentlemen of the Row" mod alleviates all the crash bugs and many of the irritating graphical glitches, but does little for the performance. GET THE MOD IF YOU BUY THIS.

I've played through it 3 times already, once on console and twice here on PC. I love the feeling of the Saints criminal empire growing, such as the way the main hideout gets renovated throughout the story, to the satisfaction of opening the map and seeing purple overtaking it as you take more and more of the city. While I liked the more goofy direction Saints Row 3 and 4 have taken, the serious story here is very compelling, and while naturally not as goofy as the later entries, has a good amount of humorous moments sprinkled in alongside some much darker moments. The shooting feels generally alright, though sometimes the aiming feels just slightly off in a way that is hard to describe. Driving is fun though it has issues (more on that shortly), and there are a ton of side activities that are fun in their own right that give you rewards, such as infinite ammo for a certain gun type, infinite sprinting, and so on, for finishing all levels of that particular activity, and the character creation, oh the character creation. SR2 still has the best character customization in the entire series, it lets you create exactly what your character looks like, all the way down to their walking animation! The clothing options seem unlimited, and you can layer your clothes, something that was lost in SR3 forward that I really wish would return. But despite all the positive things, this game isn't perfect. Not by a long shot. For starters, the pc port. This is easily the second worst port I have ever had the displeasure of dealing with (First worst being Assassins Creed 3, the only port that was so bad that it was literally unplayable for me). Performance is absolutely terrible, its always a bad sign when the next game in the series both looks better and performs (infinitely) better. Even if you have a powerful enough computer to get high framerate, whenever the game loads a new chunk of the city as you drive around, the game stutters for a second, and you can kiss all hope of driving precisely in that moment goodbye. It may not sound bad, but I was always crashing into everything because of the game stuttering, and while after a certain point you get used to stuttering and can minimize its effect on your driving, you can never fully adapt to it. Speaking of crashing, you better make your desktop background something good, because with this game, you will be seeing your desktop quite a bit. This game, being a bad port from console, is probably best played with controller (though there are tweaks if you prefer keyboard and mouse) but despite this, the game doesn't show controller prompts. If you are wary about using mods, then don't buy this game, because some of the issues listed above (lack of controller prompts, some bug fixes) can be fixed by using the Gentlemen of the Row mod...Yes, they managed to screw the port up so bad you need to use mods to make it more stable. Most of my issues with this game stem from the port, only one really comes from the game itself: how easy it is to get ragdolled. I once failed a mission because I got ragdolled, and the game decided that everytime my character got up, they were just going to fall right back to the ground, while two nearby police officers laid into me with shotguns. Two enemies aren't a threat in this game, not even a little bit, yet I still died because my character decided that the pavement was the most interesting thing he had ever seen and couldn't pull himself away from it, and even when the ragdoll effect isn't glitching out, it's still annoying to get ragdolled by some enemy ramming their car into you, then pull yourself back up only to get rammed again. I have died numerous times to this and it is the only real time that the deaths felt unfair, as once that first ragdoll happened, I wasn't able to do anything to stop it happening again. Aside from occasional occurances like that where you effectively get stunlocked to death by the ragdoll effect, I really don't have anything else to complain about. If you are willing to install a mod and save obsessively to avoid losing progress when the game inevitably crashes, you will find a lot to like about Saints Row 2...Just get it on sale or something, even at the discounted standard price of $10 the port is just so bad that it isn't worth it. If you have a low spec machine or are too wary of mods, just buy SR3 instead. It's not as good, but a whole lot more stable. Something to note, however is that some people have stated that a good amount of issues with the port simply don't show up on windows 8, the game supposedly runs better and crashes less on it. I don't know how true it is, but if you are running Windows 8, it's something to consider.","April 4, 2015","true","42.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Do you like to make stuff kaboom? Can you enjoy a game that is half-serious and otherwise filled with utter insanity and irreverent humor?\n\nIf yes, check this out. Seriously. It's one of the best games i've ever played.\n\nOk bad stuff. It's a console port, and there are issues with that. The respect thing that locks you out of story missions until you are at a certain level is kinda stupid. Lastly some of the missions are a little obnoxious, like the ones where you have to chase someone in a car that moves at least as fast as yours does.\n\nBut that's really it. It's a sandbox crime game, so you know it has considerable replayability and mess-about potential. The story might have a relatively simple main thread (lets take over this city), but the smaller parts towards getting there can actually be quite good. They can also be rather dark, which is in contrast to much of the rest of a game that allows you to, for example, drive a sewage truck around spraying poo all over stuff. There is also an insane amount of character customization options, allowing you to create just about any sort of look you can imagine. Oh yes, and like any yummy PC game there's mods worth getting, such as Gentlemen of the Row (clothing, weapons, more stuff in general, etc). And so on...\n\nAnyway, play it.

Saints Row 2 is on the edge of reality, with both it's realistic and occasionally, quite silly missions. It's a game, that dosen't require much skill to play, but nonetheless, is great fun. Comparing to the GTA series, where I failed missions quite often, on SR2, I failed on really rare occasions. However, the wide variety of activities and diversions around Stilwater makes the easiness all worthwhile.\nAgain, on the technical side, one can't help but make comparisons with GTA (Mainly San Andreas). There is a much more advanced character customization system, which allows you to change everything from the depth of your character's forehead to his facial expressions. Although the amount of clothing in the game stores might seem small, it is possible to change the colour of the items from an extensive palette of colours. Also, SR2 offers you a wide variety of vehicles, which all, dissapointingly, seem to be pretty much identical in performance. Also, the ingame radio soundtrack is pretty poor. Especially  dissapointing was the 80s hits radio, which only featured a small handful of songs. While the things I listed were just minor issues that may only be annoying for me, there seem to be a few bugs in the game for which I had to find a solution online. Bugs, that don't allow you to progress further in the game without special consultation, are the most dissappealing.\nIn conclusion, Saints Row 2 is a good alternative to the GTA series, with a small hint of a shoot-em-up game. The story might not be as deep and the technical gameplay not as good, but it sure is fun as hell!","December 24, 2013","true","49.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"

If a grittier, less-campy version of Saints Row 3 appeals to you and you are patient, you might enjoy Saints Row 2 despite its defects.\n\nSaints Row 2 Review (Spoiler Free)\nStory\n\nSet after the events of the first Saints Row, Saints Row 2 (SR2) begins with the protagonist from the first game waking up from his (or her depending on your character creation choices) coma in a maximum security prison.  After a daring escape, your character returns to Stillwater to find it has changed beyond recognition.  It turns out that in the years your character was in a coma, the Saints dissolved and three new gangs have moved into Stillwater.  Former Saints have been arrested or are in hiding, previously held territory has been divided among the new gangs, and the Saints are leaderless.  Worse still, the mysterious Ultor Corporation has shown up and has its hands in everything from local government to law enforcement.  Starting from the ground up, your character begins to rebuild the Saints yard-by-yard, taking over enemy gang businesses, disrupting vice operations, and being a general pain in the Ultor Corporation's side.  Saints Row 2 sees the Saints stop at nothing to attain what they have in SR3.\n\nGameplay\n\nSR2 differentiates itself from its contemporaries through how it handles missions.  The story missions are divided into threes (one for each gang) with one of the Saint's lieutenants handling each gang and can be completed in any order.  Subsequent story missions must be unlocked through acquiring reputation.  Reputation, cash, and character upgrades are acquired mostly through completing activities, such as impersonating a police officer for a COPS style TV show, committing insurance fraud, racing, joining a fight club, or using a sewage truck to devalue real-estate.  The variety among activities keeps them from going stale, though there are a few that are more aggravating than the rest. In addition to activities there are lots of collectables to find as a few cribs to buy and upgrade, giving plenty of reason to keep playing.  As with most open world games, your fun is increased when playing co-op though you should expect to play this with someone from your friends list since the online servers are no more.\n\nA straight play-through without any lollygagging will take around 8-10 hours depending on your skill.\n\nDesign\n\nI cannot run this game at max settings but if I could, I imagine it would look decent for a last-gen game.  Nevertheless, Stillwater is home to a variety of unique environments each with their own interesting sights and sounds.  Downtown is bustling, the suburbs are quiet, and the projects are dilapidated.  Guns sound powerful and explosions are devestating at times, ragdolling everything (even you) in their radius.  Each gang has its own personality, ranging from cars to member clothing and weapons.  The object physics in the game make it all the more fun, especially when most things seen on the sidewalk can be used as a melee weapon.  The radio stations have their own personalities and can be quite fun to listen to on their own.  Driving in the game is very difficult, especially in the case of motor cylcles which are hard to just keep upright.  Ragdolling can be troubling at times too.\n\nWhen I first played SR2, I could not progress in the game in its vanilla state.  I had to download a mod that fixed the issues with the vanilla version.  Buyers be warned.\n\nFinal Comments\nHaving to Install a mod in order to run would usually put me off of a game, but I am a patient person and am willing to do a little leg work if it means I can experience something unique.  Was my money worth the time and effort?  I would answer yes.  The story in SR2 is the most interesting in the series in my opinion.  Brutal at times in terms of its story, it feels more realistic than SR3 but is far from dull.  As I said before, if you thought SR3 needed less panache and can deal with a little modding, you may find SR2 more satisfying despite its age.\n\nThe only mod I needed to download to get the game working was "The Gentlemen of the Row" mod.  Here is a link to the thread that I used to get the game working where you'll find this mod along with several others that may interest you: http://steamcommunity.com/app/9480/discussions/0/846958724811426425/","April 16, 2015","true","66.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","3"

I've played through it 3 times already, once on console and twice here on PC. I love the feeling of the Saints criminal empire growing, such as the way the main hideout gets renovated throughout the story, to the satisfaction of opening the map and seeing purple overtaking it as you take more and more of the city. While I liked the more goofy direction Saints Row 3 and 4 have taken, the serious story here is very compelling, and while naturally not as goofy as the later entries, has a good amount of humorous moments sprinkled in alongside some much darker moments. The shooting feels generally alright, though sometimes the aiming feels just slightly off in a way that is hard to describe. Driving is fun though it has issues (more on that shortly), and there are a ton of side activities that are fun in their own right that give you rewards, such as infinite ammo for a certain gun type, infinite sprinting, and so on, for finishing all levels of that particular activity, and the character creation, oh the character creation. SR2 still has the best character customization in the entire series, it lets you create exactly what your character looks like, all the way down to their walking animation! The clothing options seem unlimited, and you can layer your clothes, something that was lost in SR3 forward that I really wish would return. But despite all the positive things, this game isn't perfect. Not by a long shot. For starters, the pc port. This is easily the second worst port I have ever had the displeasure of dealing with (First worst being Assassins Creed 3, the only port that was so bad that it was literally unplayable for me). Performance is absolutely terrible, its always a bad sign when the next game in the series both looks better and performs (infinitely) better. Even if you have a powerful enough computer to get high framerate, whenever the game loads a new chunk of the city as you drive around, the game stutters for a second, and you can kiss all hope of driving precisely in that moment goodbye. It may not sound bad, but I was always crashing into everything because of the game stuttering, and while after a certain point you get used to stuttering and can minimize its effect on your driving, you can never fully adapt to it. Speaking of crashing, you better make your desktop background something good, because with this game, you will be seeing your desktop quite a bit. This game, being a bad port from console, is probably best played with controller (though there are tweaks if you prefer keyboard and mouse) but despite this, the game doesn't show controller prompts. If you are wary about using mods, then don't buy this game, because some of the issues listed above (lack of controller prompts, some bug fixes) can be fixed by using the Gentlemen of the Row mod...Yes, they managed to screw the port up so bad you need to use mods to make it more stable. Most of my issues with this game stem from the port, only one really comes from the game itself: how easy it is to get ragdolled. I once failed a mission because I got ragdolled, and the game decided that everytime my character got up, they were just going to fall right back to the ground, while two nearby police officers laid into me with shotguns. Two enemies aren't a threat in this game, not even a little bit, yet I still died because my character decided that the pavement was the most interesting thing he had ever seen and couldn't pull himself away from it, and even when the ragdoll effect isn't glitching out, it's still annoying to get ragdolled by some enemy ramming their car into you, then pull yourself back up only to get rammed again. I have died numerous times to this and it is the only real time that the deaths felt unfair, as once that first ragdoll happened, I wasn't able to do anything to stop it happening again. Aside from occasional occurances like that where you effectively get stunlocked to death by the ragdoll effect, I really don't have anything else to complain about. If you are willing to install a mod and save obsessively to avoid losing progress when the game inevitably crashes, you will find a lot to like about Saints Row 2...Just get it on sale or something, even at the discounted standard price of $10 the port is just so bad that it isn't worth it. If you have a low spec machine or are too wary of mods, just buy SR3 instead. It's not as good, but a whole lot more stable. Something to note, however is that some people have stated that a good amount of issues with the port simply don't show up on windows 8, the game supposedly runs better and crashes less on it. I don't know how true it is, but if you are running Windows 8, it's something to consider.","April 4, 2015","true","42.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There are some mods out there to fix large chunks of it, but it's still gonna be shoddy and janky no matter what.\n\nStill, if you're like me and played SR3 first, this is totally a good way to scratch the itch for more if you can handle jank, and it's got a lot more variety and flavor to itself. Port issues aside I totally see why some people prefer this one to its sequel, some of the unlocks and side missions really do have a better feel than what came out in The Third.\n\nOn the other hand, nothing in SR:TT required me to slow down the ♥♥♥♥ing game with Cheat Engine's speedhack to make it even humanly possible, so, you know.

Stillwater is one of the funnest open worlds you can ever mess around in, there's a lot of side activities to do and a lot of ways to have fun with your friends. the campaign is very epic and even very emotional at times and you can easily find yourself spending up to 20 to 40 hours trying to beat it all. this game has one of the most in depth character creators I've ever seen in a game, you can make your character look like whoever or whatever you want. this game may be old but it is still awesome, it still out shines a lot of modern day open world games and it has definitely stood the test of time ;) I would definitely recommend it.\n\nFinal Score: (8/10) Awesome :3","April 28, 2014","true","31.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

While playing I noticed it does not exactly run as smooth as it should be. Saints Row 2 was meant to be played on a console. The controls are so sensitive that it took me a while  playing the game to get use to the driving. I really liked the game even if I had a few bugs and glitches but I would still recommend it to all my friends. I also found some mods that promised to fix some of the bugs but it was far from perfect. The mods did make some of the gameplay more enjoyable. The overall story was really good and the missions were addictive. BUT if you are looking for a great Open-world experience you should rather check out Saints Row the Third or IV. They run smoother and they are a better bang for your buck.\n\n**********  7.5/10  **********","April 26, 2015","true","0.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Hell sure this game has some problems here and there but what do you expect it was made in 2009 and its already 2015. The bad part is the ai progamming but compared to some ai program now saints rows 2 ai is still much smarter. Car controls are not that bad once you get used to it ( just press space and drift the ♥♥♥♥ out of everything ). But oh man the helicopter controls are the worst but still you dont spend most of the time in a heli so screw that. The motor physics make me want to rip my face off sometimes but if you get used controlling it its no problem. The good part. Everything else. Compared to the other saints row games i actually find this more fun. Literally went out of my way just to do the activities. Unlike the other saints row, every start of the activity has a cutscene. And the ones that require a ai to accompany you are hella funny. The story is also engaging like you literally wanna immediately pop the leader's head off because he did something to your crew. Also the melee weapons have finishing moves and the samurai sword is badass af. There's also different melee fighting styles in case you get bored of the style you are fighting with. The only soundtracks you gonna need is take on me and the final countdown because just do it and you'll see what happens. There's also no short of a variety of cars you wanna drive. Anyways the bad part is just 10% of the game and the fun part makes up the rest. Get pass the bad part and you'll enjoy the game.","September 15, 2015","true","42.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I've played through it 3 times already, once on console and twice here on PC. I love the feeling of the Saints criminal empire growing, such as the way the main hideout gets renovated throughout the story, to the satisfaction of opening the map and seeing purple overtaking it as you take more and more of the city. While I liked the more goofy direction Saints Row 3 and 4 have taken, the serious story here is very compelling, and while naturally not as goofy as the later entries, has a good amount of humorous moments sprinkled in alongside some much darker moments. The shooting feels generally alright, though sometimes the aiming feels just slightly off in a way that is hard to describe. Driving is fun though it has issues (more on that shortly), and there are a ton of side activities that are fun in their own right that give you rewards, such as infinite ammo for a certain gun type, infinite sprinting, and so on, for finishing all levels of that particular activity, and the character creation, oh the character creation. SR2 still has the best character customization in the entire series, it lets you create exactly what your character looks like, all the way down to their walking animation! The clothing options seem unlimited, and you can layer your clothes, something that was lost in SR3 forward that I really wish would return. But despite all the positive things, this game isn't perfect. Not by a long shot. For starters, the pc port. This is easily the second worst port I have ever had the displeasure of dealing with (First worst being Assassins Creed 3, the only port that was so bad that it was literally unplayable for me). Performance is absolutely terrible, its always a bad sign when the next game in the series both looks better and performs (infinitely) better. Even if you have a powerful enough computer to get high framerate, whenever the game loads a new chunk of the city as you drive around, the game stutters for a second, and you can kiss all hope of driving precisely in that moment goodbye. It may not sound bad, but I was always crashing into everything because of the game stuttering, and while after a certain point you get used to stuttering and can minimize its effect on your driving, you can never fully adapt to it. Speaking of crashing, you better make your desktop background something good, because with this game, you will be seeing your desktop quite a bit. This game, being a bad port from console, is probably best played with controller (though there are tweaks if you prefer keyboard and mouse) but despite this, the game doesn't show controller prompts. If you are wary about using mods, then don't buy this game, because some of the issues listed above (lack of controller prompts, some bug fixes) can be fixed by using the Gentlemen of the Row mod...Yes, they managed to screw the port up so bad you need to use mods to make it more stable. Most of my issues with this game stem from the port, only one really comes from the game itself: how easy it is to get ragdolled. I once failed a mission because I got ragdolled, and the game decided that everytime my character got up, they were just going to fall right back to the ground, while two nearby police officers laid into me with shotguns. Two enemies aren't a threat in this game, not even a little bit, yet I still died because my character decided that the pavement was the most interesting thing he had ever seen and couldn't pull himself away from it, and even when the ragdoll effect isn't glitching out, it's still annoying to get ragdolled by some enemy ramming their car into you, then pull yourself back up only to get rammed again. I have died numerous times to this and it is the only real time that the deaths felt unfair, as once that first ragdoll happened, I wasn't able to do anything to stop it happening again. Aside from occasional occurances like that where you effectively get stunlocked to death by the ragdoll effect, I really don't have anything else to complain about. If you are willing to install a mod and save obsessively to avoid losing progress when the game inevitably crashes, you will find a lot to like about Saints Row 2...Just get it on sale or something, even at the discounted standard price of $10 the port is just so bad that it isn't worth it. If you have a low spec machine or are too wary of mods, just buy SR3 instead. It's not as good, but a whole lot more stable. Something to note, however is that some people have stated that a good amount of issues with the port simply don't show up on windows 8, the game supposedly runs better and crashes less on it. I don't know how true it is, but if you are running Windows 8, it's something to consider.","April 4, 2015","true","42.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game allows you to create your own character and the amount of customizability makes it great right out the gate.  You can adorn your character with crazy outfits or let him run around in nothing but his/her underwear.  It's the classic no-cover third person shooter which bring it back to the earlier times in a way.  This games story is simple and direct which is nice cause that's all this game really needs.  It's not a serious game in any way and that's what people are going to like about it.  Anyone who prefers "realism" over fun would want to avoid this game like it's the plague because the fun never really ends once you start.  You have a badass character who takes things into his/her own hands and doesn't let anyone take it away and you carry an arsenal with you at all times.  What's not to like about that?

I am a big fan of open world/sandbox games and having already played a couple GTA titles on console and pc, I decided to give Saints Row 2 a chance. There were a lot of complaints about how people were having games that were running at faster speed than normal, but I think it is fine for Windows 8. There is a cutscene bug where the game will black screen if you don't skip it, but I found a mod that had a lot of add ons as well as fixed the minor bugs. After that, I gotta say it's one of the few games where I played beginning to end in the span of just two weeks. It's not the longest game in the world, but the story is interesting and captivating, even making me question the motivations behind each character, but also has some comedy sprinkled in. The music was bearable, so I didn't turn off the radio the second I got into any car. The controls aren't the smoothest because it's a port, but again it was fine for me so I won't hold it against them. Overall it was a great experience and I had a lot of fun. If the game is on sale and you like sandbox games, then give Saints Row 2 a shot. I'm sure glad I did.","June 13, 2014","true","27.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

Never played SR1 so can't compare it to prequel. Can't say that story is long but it can take some time if you are going for upgrades (completing challenges and other stuff to unlock various stuff and items). Very good character customization by which i mean create your character how do you want with no limit. Playing solo sometimes is boring but when you have a friend to play with then you gonna have some great time, but comparing solo with coop then coop is mostly bugged than solo and can ruin all fun. Also while driving very often you get lag spikes what can ruin gameplay and ♥♥♥♥ of player.

Saints Row 2 is on the edge of reality, with both it's realistic and occasionally, quite silly missions. It's a game, that dosen't require much skill to play, but nonetheless, is great fun. Comparing to the GTA series, where I failed missions quite often, on SR2, I failed on really rare occasions. However, the wide variety of activities and diversions around Stilwater makes the easiness all worthwhile.\nAgain, on the technical side, one can't help but make comparisons with GTA (Mainly San Andreas). There is a much more advanced character customization system, which allows you to change everything from the depth of your character's forehead to his facial expressions. Although the amount of clothing in the game stores might seem small, it is possible to change the colour of the items from an extensive palette of colours. Also, SR2 offers you a wide variety of vehicles, which all, dissapointingly, seem to be pretty much identical in performance. Also, the ingame radio soundtrack is pretty poor. Especially  dissapointing was the 80s hits radio, which only featured a small handful of songs. While the things I listed were just minor issues that may only be annoying for me, there seem to be a few bugs in the game for which I had to find a solution online. Bugs, that don't allow you to progress further in the game without special consultation, are the most dissappealing.\nIn conclusion, Saints Row 2 is a good alternative to the GTA series, with a small hint of a shoot-em-up game. The story might not be as deep and the technical gameplay not as good, but it sure is fun as hell!","December 24, 2013","true","49.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"

I have a Quad Core Intel CPU running at 3ghz with 2 GB of ram and even on my 9800 GTX the game struggles to maintain a good frame rate at a high resolution (1920). I was getting performance around the 15-20 fps mark which I don't think is particularly acceptable in 2009 for such a decent gaming PC. Clearly developers recently feel we should all be running Skulltrail with 3 280 GTXs in SLI to get acceptable performance from our console ports!"\n\nThis game is a jewel. But you can't enjoy it because it runs at 30 FPS and drops twice a minute under 10. This plus the right-left not responding sometimes, the time-limited or timing missions, and you'll want to plug you keyboard in your screen.\n\nBuy and play it ONLY if you have a great PC.","December 21, 2011","true","37.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I won't be giving any spoilers to ruin the fun but all I can say is, the player is back! What more could you ask for?\n\nYou will meet a host of familiar characters along the way, adding to the fun if you have played the first game. The mini-games are a ton of hilarious antics that will most certainly crack you up, much better than any of the mini-games in the whole series in my opinion.\n\nWhat I liked most about this game though, is how dark the story was when dealing with the usual 4 gangs the player will meet in a Saints Row game. There is a very good balance between humour and seriousness in this installment so I highly recommend Saints Row 2 to the multitude of people who feel that the series is just made of complete, utter nonsensical writing.","December 23, 2013","true","10.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I mean, at worst, the game has some lag, which isn't really distracting for me, and also, yes, the driving controls are ridiculous. However, despite what I listed, nothing seems wrong with the game. In my opinon, if Saints Row 2 has a free weekend again, I would reccomend you playing the game then before buying the game to see what you think (also, on Windows 8.1, you need to change the Compatability Mode of SR2_pc.exe to Windows Vista). So yeah, that is my opinion on the PC version. I like it, but it does has its fault.

Stilwater is a vibrant place, where the (freely accessible) buildings/locales often serve as backdrops for campaign missions.\n\nIt might confuse a newcomer, but the game often references characters, plots, and tasks from SR1.

I really WANT to reccommend the hell out of this game, but the PC port is so bad that it becomes really difficult to do so. So I'll just pick "yes" solely because the actual game itself is really awesome, but you're gonna have to potentially do a lot of manual installation of community-made packages that contain optional mods and numerous bugfixes if you want the best experience.\n\nNot gonna spoil anything plot-wise, but this isn't some "GTA clone" as the drones have been parroting for years. The game is a wonderful combination of bats**t wackiness and grounded realism. Everything the game has to offer is wonderful so I won't get into it much, but instead I'll focus on the negatives of the PC port.\n\n*This port wasn't done by Volition (the original devs), but CD Projekt (not CD Projekt Red) who really flubbed the port job.\n*Has really terrible audio quality overall, it sounds like 64kbps mp3 quality, not even joking. This goes for every sound in the game. There was a community fix for this which fixes the radio stations at least, but everything else is still jacked up.\n*Has odd CPU timing issues where on some machines the game will run multi-times faster than the normal 1x speed it should be running at, leading to disorientation and annoyance.\n*Prone to random framedrops and fluctuations regardless of how good your rig is\n*All multiplayer relied on Gamespy's servers to function -- now that Gamespy went under, the only way to enjoy multiplayer or co-op is via a VPN tunneling client of your choice, but even then it's not guaranteed to work. I tried and failed with a friend across two different VPN programs and we had zero success. Some people have this issue, there is no universal fix.\n*Can randomly crash sometimes, of course.\n\nNow the community patch, called "Gentlemen of the Row" indeed fixes many of these issues among many other game logic bugs and whatnot, as well as coming with a huge number of optional gameplay mods and content mods that add a large swath of new vehicles, clothing, animations, customization options, and more. Definitely get that if you want to play this. The CPU timing bug requires another fix which you can find via some rudimentary googling.\n\nHope this primer helped someone.","September 12, 2015","true","1.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Get the Gentlemen of The Row mod, and be sure to turn Dynamic Lighting ingame to Simple, but also be sure to turn Ambient Occlusion to All. Dynamic Lighting at all kills FPS on any system, but leaving it at simple w/o Ambient Occlusion make the game look like complete ♥♥♥♥. AO at all will not make the game unplayable, and will also improve the visuals significantly. Now, the game itself:\nPROS:\n-Great storyline (SRTT and SRIV have comparatively weak stories)\n-Ridiculous amounts of fun (like Saints Row has always had)\n-Stilwater > Steelport\n-More character customization than SRTT (SRIV does contend, however)\n-Beautifully constructed world (unfortunately marred by the otherwise horrendous PC port)\n-Fun Co-Op that can still be enjoyed today thanks to mods.\nCONS:\n-Horrible Port (can be fixed but I still can't hit constant 60 FPS without making it look absolutely terrible)\n-Won't appeal to people that prefer the newer games (this game still has a Grand Theft Auto feel to it, whereas SRTT and SRIV are completely unique)\n-DAMN THE STUPID SPEEDUP BUG (ruined 25 percent of my story immersion). Fortunately it can be fixed.\n-Audio quality for everything is abysmal compared to 360 and PS3. The radio stations can be fixed, but the SFX and Voices are stuck at Compressed Bit Syndrome (Mod fixes are in development)\n\nCONCLUSION:\nI got this game with the Ultimate Franchise Pack on Summer Sale for $11, so I cannot complain.

Get the Gentlemen of The Row mod, and be sure to turn Dynamic Lighting ingame to Simple, but also be sure to turn Ambient Occlusion to All. Dynamic Lighting at all kills FPS on any system, but leaving it at simple w/o Ambient Occlusion make the game look like complete ♥♥♥♥. AO at all will not make the game unplayable, and will also improve the visuals significantly. Now, the game itself:\nPROS:\n-Great storyline (SRTT and SRIV have comparatively weak stories)\n-Ridiculous amounts of fun (like Saints Row has always had)\n-Stilwater > Steelport\n-More character customization than SRTT (SRIV does contend, however)\n-Beautifully constructed world (unfortunately marred by the otherwise horrendous PC port)\n-Fun Co-Op that can still be enjoyed today thanks to mods.\nCONS:\n-Horrible Port (can be fixed but I still can't hit constant 60 FPS without making it look absolutely terrible)\n-Won't appeal to people that prefer the newer games (this game still has a Grand Theft Auto feel to it, whereas SRTT and SRIV are completely unique)\n-DAMN THE STUPID SPEEDUP BUG (ruined 25 percent of my story immersion). Fortunately it can be fixed.\n-Audio quality for everything is abysmal compared to 360 and PS3. The radio stations can be fixed, but the SFX and Voices are stuck at Compressed Bit Syndrome (Mod fixes are in development)\n\nCONCLUSION:\nI got this game with the Ultimate Franchise Pack on Summer Sale for $11, so I cannot complain. However, for $10 standalone you will need to have lots of patience for me to recommend this.","July 10, 2015","true","47.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Hell sure this game has some problems here and there but what do you expect it was made in 2009 and its already 2015. The bad part is the ai progamming but compared to some ai program now saints rows 2 ai is still much smarter. Car controls are not that bad once you get used to it ( just press space and drift the ♥♥♥♥ out of everything ). But oh man the helicopter controls are the worst but still you dont spend most of the time in a heli so screw that. The motor physics make me want to rip my face off sometimes but if you get used controlling it its no problem. The good part. Everything else. Compared to the other saints row games i actually find this more fun. Literally went out of my way just to do the activities. Unlike the other saints row, every start of the activity has a cutscene. And the ones that require a ai to accompany you are hella funny. The story is also engaging like you literally wanna immediately pop the leader's head off because he did something to your crew. Also the melee weapons have finishing moves and the samurai sword is badass af. There's also different melee fighting styles in case you get bored of the style you are fighting with. The only soundtracks you gonna need is take on me and the final countdown because just do it and you'll see what happens. There's also no short of a variety of cars you wanna drive. Anyways the bad part is just 10% of the game and the fun part makes up the rest.

From the amusingly dark story of the fall and rise to power, to its rich environment where players have the opportunity to explore a city full of life and diversity. This ten-dollar game is worth all your money, and will leave you satisfied. To sum up the game as best as I can, it's basically all the flaws that GTA 4 had, except done right! I won't try to go deep into the story, since that'll probably spoil the first game. I'll just say that it's one of those plots where the protagonist's power has fallen, and he tries to reclaim it by building his own empire, while having to face conflict with the men who are in his path. Sounds edgy, right? Well, the genius writers decided to have this story take place in a diverse environment where you can be serious one minute, and be a crazed psychopath the next (something that GTA 4 failed to do). This is what makes the game shine; you just watched a cutscene of a main character being killed off, and to gain respect to move further on within the storyline, you can take part in these activities. These activities involve throwing crazed fans into helicopter blades in order to protect a celebrity, or committing insurance fraud by getting run over by on-coming vehicles (it's as fun as it sounds). While we're on the topic of the diversity in the game, the map's been completely re-designed from the first game to where nothing looks the same (different buildings, different environments, and many unique locations), and the NPCs' style are set to fit in with the environment (Goths, Yuppies, Rednecks, College Kids, and etc.). In my own opinion, this is truly a great, unappreciated game! I definitely recommend it! But, I can tell a lot of Rockstar fanboys are going to disagree me with that, and label the game a "GTA Clone". And while I could go hours debunking that claim, I'll just leave you all with a great point given by Flippy.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOhWHlpB9ws\n\n- All credit for the video belongs to FL1PPY\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOZfpWD7SM5t1Mmk0_aJdfw","March 19","true","399.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It may not have the depth and content of a GTA game, but it's got a lot of charm and just pure fun.\n\nThe city of Stillwater is a sprawling metropolis that feels alive and filled with detail. It may be relatively small compared to the worlds of newer sandbox titles, but each area is unique and memorable.\n\nThe gameplay, as I said previously, is incredibly fun. Reckless driving and well-made combat is the essence of the game and key to what makes it what it is. It feels tight (although the handling could be a little better, but I understand in the context of the game it makes sense to be poor) and the systems are easy to get used to.\n\nHowever, this basic gameplay is somewhat ruined by the Respect system, which I feel brings the game down. The Respect system basically entails that you must fill up your Respect bar to play missions. This is done by doing Activites around the city. My grudge with this is that the game forces you to play what would be considered "side missions" or trivial activities in other games in order to enjoy the main meat of the game. There's about 10 or so of these different activities and 5 levels of them can be completed each, with a higher difficulty each time. They're relatively enjoyable at first, but as I got further in I got frustrated at the fact I was forced into doing these Activities, all of which I had done before but at a lower difficulty, just to play the main game missions and stronghold missions.\n\nThe game advertises itself as having a raft of customisation options - while there is customisation options, these are nowhere near as detailed the advertising would have you suggest. There is some nice choices, although I never really saw them as a big part of the game.\n\nThe graphics are nothing special, but you do have to remember this was released in 2008 - although it isn't really an issue to me anyway. The controls are pretty much fine too.\n\nThe story is actually quite good for a game in this genre. Sure, it has your typical violence-fuelled gang warfare, but it also has an underlying humour about it that makes you love it. On the surface, it doesn't seem that interesting, but as you move forward, you begin to really take in the cutscenes and engage in the story.\n\nMy second main criticism of this game (other than the Respect system) is that there's simply not enough interesting stuff to really do in Stillwater. After you get a few hours into the game the Activities feel like a chore rather than a fun side mission, and when you get bored of exploring Stillwater while running people over and attracting police attention there isn't actually that much else to do. This makes the game feel surprisingly linear for a sandbox game, which is obviously the opposite of what the developers were intending to achieve. The world of Stillwater is there, and it's alive, but I felt a severe lack of participation in it.\n\nIt's also worth noting this PC port has very, very bad FPS drops and it can be annoying even at the best of times.\n\nTo conclude, Sants Row 2 is a very fun game at its core. It has great gameplay mixed with an enjoyable story, and a world that feels well-designed and lively. However, the game is brought down by the Respect system and also the lack of actual content you want to do outside the missions. The FPS drops in this port can also be a general annoyance. However, Saints Row 2 is still a very good game that you'd do well to pick up for cheap sometime in order to have hours of good old-fashioned carnage and fun.","May 30, 2014","true","21.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Its surprising how well it runs on the PC, as it originally was supposed to be run on console. The characters are very well done, the plot is consistent and there are many twists and turns on the adventure throughout the game. The audio was a bit static-y, but I got used to it after a while. I played this game for a few hours, keeping my attention throughout. My game blackscreened, however, and I heard nothing but guns firing. Its alright though, it only took me half an hour to get the game to run in the first place as it kept crashing on start up. I recommend this game to everyone else. My screen was black for ten minutes at least, and then afterwards the guns stopped firing and I heard soft voices. The voices kept cutting out, but its still a good game. I tried to quit the game as it obviously wasnt going to work again, but it wouldnt quit. The voices came back, and I had to launch task manager in order to quit the game. My computer thought I was still in game, so I had to alt-shift on my desktop and it went back to normal.\n\n10/10, its a great game and everyone should play it at least once.","June 3, 2015","true","34.9"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

There are 3 story paths that you can do in whatever order you want to.\nThe character customization is best i have ever seen the models and textures are bit old but there are grazy amounts of layered clothing, neck chains, headwear, grib customization, gang customization, car customization is also great and the soundtrack is awesome.\nThe city of Stilwater is my favorite it just feels alive with all the people doing their own things not just walking around like in most open world games. There are lots of things that happen without players input airplanes take off or land, people start fights, cops beating up someone, gangs fighting eachother or cops it's just fun to watch.\n\nThe pc port of saints row 2 is very bad you should be aware of that, it has framerate problems crashes/bugs ,bad sound guality. Gentlemen of the row mod fixes most of the bugs and adds more content to the game, i would advice you to use it.\nOverall this is great game even with the pc port being bad you should buy it.","March 24, 2015","true","227.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

While the trailers may make it seem that Volition doesn't take story or character seriously, Saints Row 2 is just a great game overall. And, yeah, the story isn't the strong point, but this ain't no drama with loads of dialog. The protagonist doesn't have time for that. Instead, you'll mostly find yourself in gun fights, helicopter fights, boat fights, fist fights, etc, while also taking over the city and taking back your territory.\n\nSet about five years after Saints Row 1, the protagonist wakes up from their coma and you get to re-imagine him/her due to their severe burns from the explosion at the end of the first game. I opted for a British male so from this point on, I'm referring to the protagonist as a he. When he wakes up, he realizes he's in jail and immediately remembers why. You break out with Carlos who joins your gang later as a Lt. The Boss (protagonist) realizes that he has to become the leader of the 3rd Street Saints and decides to free Johnny Gat during his trial because of all the killing he did the first game. The two of you recruit three Lts, Shaundi, Pierce, and Carlos, and from there, you start to take over Stillwater, one district/mission at a time.\n\nWhat's truly remarkable about this sequel is the cinematic direction they chose with the cut scenes. The cut scenes are simply amazing and I even went ahead and watched some of them twice, just because they were that great. The writing is pretty good, and there are 80000 lines of dialog, over twice from the first game. The protagonist speaks in this one, giving him a more rounded personality versus being a drone. The overall story is nice, and they were aiming for hyper realism, as in over the top, bizarre action. There are activities on the side, usually street racing, causing chaos, trail blazing, insurance fraud, etc, which is definitely a lot more fun than bowling with your cousin.\n\nOn the tech side, the graphics are decent. The PC port isn't amazing, but it's functional and you're actually able to play it. Can't say the same about GTA IV. Saints Row 2, being a 2008 release from a lesser known company, is definitely not a  great looking game, but the overall city design and character design, and how much customization there is makes up for it. The devs definitely put a lot of thought in the overall feel of the game. I really enjoyed making money and buying cribs, building an empire, more or less.\n\nGreat game.\n\n9.0/10","September 11, 2015","true","22.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

My suggestion is to do an Internet search for "Gentlemen of the Row", the title of a mega-mod that fixes most existing bugs, and adds a lot to the game. In its default configuration it fixes some major bugs, adds in new (but subtle) functionality to the game and incorporates some character costumes and vehicles that are normally inaccessible to player characters. If you decide to customize it though, it can add in cheats, give you new over-powered weapons like the "flamingo gun", and generally make the game really, really bizarre. I ran it with default settings and barely noticed it was there; it just made the existing game BETTER, without getting in the way.\n\nSaints Row 2 can't measure up to the insanity of its sequel, but it's a heck of a lot of fun on its own, and is often on sale for a stupidly low price.

Thankfully, it's on PC, so the community has done a lot of modding to fix it up. If you have some patience then you can easily find some fixes and make the PC port a lot better.\n\nIf you're looking for a good open world game then you might wanna look into getting this game, the only real downside I can think of is the PC version so be careful with that.\n","January 24, 2014","true","4.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Saints Row 2 was the last one (and unfortunately only the second, obviously) to actually capture that true gang image. Sure SR3 had gangs, but you were suddenly big celebrity man and it just felt like a complete mockery.\n\nIf you want a game for story involving gangs, look towards this.\n\nIt is a bit buggy at times. Maybe often. And maybe the driving sensitivty is a bit odd, but it's still a true gang game with an amazing soundtrack, open world, story, characters, customization, activities, and the overall feeling of running a gang.\n\n\nHowever, if you want the "random xd" humor of what is no longer a game about gangs then go ahead and get SR3 I guess.","May 3","true","200.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Saints row 2 is a perfect blend of comedy and drama, and times it at the right moments. No awkward jokes during a death scene, and no out of place dramatic moments in what is meant to be a funnier part. The world is great, and feels more like a real city than any GTA clone I've played before. One of the best city maps I've seen. In the world you can do crazy things like jerking of on top of a moving train, handstanding on cars, hijacking a sewrige truck to spray, etc. There are a few dramatic scenes involving  a dramatic mercy killing, and watching a friend die without being able to do anything. . The game feautures a wide array of well developed characters, 3 gangs, each you will come to hate. The story is not that great but I enjoyed it and found myself invested and actually caring about what happens. The side activities are ok, some really fun but others are a chore and you will only play them to earn respect. The city of Stilwater is a great map. While not being huge, the level of detail is amazing, especially compared to Just Cause 2 or the late Saints games. Buskers, skaters, mimers and orange singers fill the streets. There is a lot of interiors, gun stores, fast food chains, strip clubs, shopping malls etc. It is like a real city. Another defining thing about Saints Row is the customisability. You choose your appearence, taunt, compliment, voice. It is one of the best character creators I've seen. I've heard about port issues, but in my playthrough I never experienced them.\n\n\n8.6/10\n\nMY PERSONAL playtime compared to cost of game\n\n$10/52hr\n\nThat's around 20c for an hour.","October 31, 2014","true","81.5"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","0"

Avoid.\n\nThen there is the flawed gem that is Saints Row 2.\nVolition fixed up *alot* of the problems that was in Saints Row and added so much more.\nPity they did'nt remove the RPG Grind aspect that is the 'Earn Respect to play Story Missions' Aspect, but at least it is more fun to do it. I recommend you Grind until you hit Level 50 of Respect, you'll be good to last until the end of the game.\n\nUp front, the PC version is Glitched and has problems. Installing Gentlemen Of The Row ( http://idolninja.com/sr2.php ) *before* starting the game would help you alot in the long run. The game will still crash to the desktop at random long sessions, so save often. After the end of every mission. The Glitches do add some extra humour to the game, especially duri/ng the cutscenes. Check out my screenshots of the game in my steam screenshot archive to see a few.\n\nAudio: Good use of sound effects, crap loads of recorded audio for the pedestrians.\nThe voice actor of Roman from Grand Theft Auto IV does some radio ads. He could be walking around somewhere too!\n\nGraphics: It was made in 2008. Saints Row The Third came out in 2011. Massive difference. Despite that, it is still very servicible. I was not at all cringing while playing.\n\nControls: Passable with a keyboard and mouse, but much better using a controller. Thanks to the Gentlemen of the Row mod, it can change all ingame control prompts for the Xbox 360 gamepad (which is what I used) or the Playstation 3 gamepad.\n\nGameplay: In comparision to Saints Row The Third and Saints Row IV, I still found it to be enjoyable. Even though I rate Saints Row IV as the most fun Saints Row I have played so far, Saints Row 2 is still a good fun game to play. Grab it when its on sale, its worth it! Although the current price of $10 is still okay, but it can't beat the $3.45 that I paid for it.\n\nStory: Ah! We have reached the creamy center! This is where Saints Row 2 shines. Out of all the Saint Rows so far, the storyline dailed in and stranglehold the pure gangster vibe of the 90's. Freedom - Remorse - Brutality - Revenge - Violence, yet it still finds time to put in alot if humour. The later games may have instilled more humour, Sainst Row 2 is a good mix of fairly seriousness and comedy.\n\nI freakin' loved Saints Row 2. Tryed to play it on the PS3, hated the controls. So much better to play it on PC, despite the glitches it has.","February 8, 2015","true","38.9"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

For starters, to make sure that I was able to get a decent FPS, I had turn the graphics all the way down - and for some reason, Saints Row IV works like a breeze with medium settings for me. The game obviouslt hasn't been optimized properly for wider screens, so I had to make do with two useless black borders as I fiddled forever with the options. The game itself isn't up to scratch. The audio sounds like it was more compressed than a 40s record, the texture quality looks like dirt and the radio stations are suprisingly poor. Even worse so, the characters all drive and walk around like they're skating on ice. Unless you can download enough patches to make this game worthwhile, it really isn't worth the money. You'd be better with Saints Row: The Third or Saints Row IV. Or even GTA. If you're desperate.","January 31, 2014","false","2.9"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

It was Saints Row 2. And no matter how many weird looks my friends gave me, I was adamant about my stance on the matter. Saints Row 2's superior driving mechanics and shooting systems won me over, as did the game's irreverent sense of humor. If all you wanted to do was steal some cars, ride around, blow stuff up, and take part in diverse, fun activities, Saints Row 2 was your game. Which is why it pains me to say that the PC version of Saints Row 2 is a big disappointment.\nSaints Row 2 is a pure sandbox experience that doesn't pretend to be anything more. It's a digital playground of toys and games for the mature gamer with a childish sense of humor. One minute you can be blowing up rival gangs from the air with an attack helicopter, while the next you can be destroying entire city blocks with a rocket launcher. You can engage in some not-so-discreet intimate activity around one corner, only to end up flinging sewage all over to lower property values around the next. Care to take over the city at gunpoint, building a crime empire through your mastery over drugs, cars, women and hustle? Or do you just want to run around town in a trench coat, flashing people for kicks? Saints Row 2 doesn't care; it encourages you to do what you want, when you want. This is the kind of game you could spend dozens upon dozens of hours on and never feel like you're doing the same thing twice.\nPerformance-wise, the PC version of Saints Row 2 doesn't hold a candle to the console versions. The framerate is choppy throughout, and the distance at which cars are visible is significantly less than in the console games. High-speed driving is frustratingly difficult when there are lots of vehicles onscreen, especially in time-sensitive missions. And so just the basic act of playing the PC version of Saints Row 2 becomes a chore in itself.\nSaints Row 2 offers a wide array of multiplayer options, but I had trouble getting the worthwhile ones up and running. The console versions featured nearly seamless "drop in and drop out" multiplayer, but you'll have to deal with a login system on PC. While I was able to join a multiplayer "gangsta brawl" free-for-all deathmatch with relative ease, attempts at playing the game cooperatively (one of the big draws of Saints Row 2 when compared to GTA4) were met with frustrating results.\nI also wasn't pleased with the way that the game's controls were revamped in the transition from console to PC. There's a complete lack of mouse support in menus, requiring you to use Shift and Ctrl keys to navigate the interface in a way I'm not sure I've ever seen in a PC game before. Driving using the mouse and keyboard layout is a chore, so you're much better off plugging in an Xbox 360 gamepad. You'll still have to manually remap many of the game's controls, however, as they don't match up one-to-one with those in the console version.\nVolition did a great job with Saints Row 2, so it's a shame that the PC gaming segment won't be able to experience the game at it was meant to be played. For now, we can only cross our fingers and hope some patches are coming to address the game's shortcomings, but really, for such a sub-par port, it's hard to hold out much hope.","March 21, 2014","true","30.5"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

Easily beats all othr GTAs and Saint Rows.\n\nThe gameplay is extremely fun, arcade, and takes the best from the GTA series. Missions are quite varied and make sure you don't get bored either. Driving a car around is a joy, and there are many interesting environments to see (although not as varied as in San Andreas). A lot of weapons and vehicles, including flying ones too. The game is full of humour and the writing is okay, although not as good as in San Andreas, but the gameplay itself feels even better than in SA. Either way, if you like one game, then you will like the other, and if you have never played neither SR nor GTA, then SR2 is a good way to start.

Where I get a solid 60fps in SR3 and 4 on ultra quality with only a couple of tweaks in the graphics menu, I barely get above 40fps in this one, even on the lowest possible settings. I have checked the forums and there are mods and tips on how to tweak, basically a ♥♥♥♥ load of reading if you want to improve the fps. From what I read from most people though, you can never get it to run at a solid 60fps, or even above 50fps from what I read from a lot of people. I mean that is bad. When you have a game that lags like that it makes playing it an impossibility. That kind of severe lag would not be tolerable on a console either.\n\n#1 all-time worst console to PC port.

The plot is simple but attractive, you could expect more but it’s worth the effort.\nThe graphics of this game are more than acceptable but they’re not good at all.\nFor me this games deserves a 4/10 but I don’t recommend it because of the high amount of issues an crashes that really take away the desire to play","October 25, 2014","false","9.5"," 9 of 17 people (53%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","53","9","17","0","0"

They respawn!), same  weapon category system and missions structure. But still, there are some major differences from GTA 4 and earlier games:\n\n-More activities. After you complete all the missions, you still have plenty of activities to complete. And those are not just taxi or other delivery missions or hidden item collecting, they are way more entertaining. For instance, you get to jump in front of a car to fly away after it hits you (insurance fraud),  you get to spray crap all over the city (Septic avenger) or dress up as cop and fight ninjas fighting pirates (FUZZ)!\n-Fun. Seriously, this game is insanely hilarious. You get to meet some funny characters, get into some aburd situations, hear some funny ads on radios... wait why am I reciting all this? Just go and check it out yourself!\n\nOne major drawback: too short, only 45 missions!","July 12, 2012","true","56.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","2"

You can build your own character from scratch, literally, you have pure freedom which you can only dream of in Grand Theft Auto games. This game is not realistic, and it's a big advantage. And there are lots of crazy things to do. And if you are tired by these - you can simply enjoy the story. While it isn't very deep or insightful, it is not cheesy at all, this game has an excellent blend of genuine drama and humour. And freaking action, of course. I guarantee you will be tense and anxious about what will happen next.\n\nThis game is, in my opinion, absolutely superior to Saints Row: The Third. Don't take me wrong - SR3 is a quite decent game, but way too nuts. Saints Row 2 perfectly mixes humour and genuine drama in itself and it has that specific chilly, gloomy and original atmosphere I haven't seen in any other game yet.\n\nGraphics aren't bad - if you have a very powerful computer (and I really mean it - this game is badly optimized and that's the only defect I can think of, the game runs quite fine on my computer though, which is Intel Dual Core 2.5, 3 GB of RAM and GeForce 430 GT 1GB). Otherwise I agree - graphics are very bad. Driving seems to be clumsy, too, but if you get used to it, it ain't that bad.\n\nIf it weren't for these defects, I'd sincerely give this game 10/10.

You can build your own character from scratch, literally, you have pure freedom which you can only dream of in Grand Theft Auto games. This game is not realistic, and it's a big advantage. And there are lots of crazy things to do. And if you are tired by these - you can simply enjoy the story. While it isn't very deep or insightful, it is not cheesy at all, this game has an excellent blend of genuine drama and humour. And freaking action, of course. I guarantee you will be tense and anxious about what will happen next.\n\nThis game is, in my opinion, absolutely superior to Saints Row: The Third. Don't take me wrong - SR3 is a quite decent game, but way too nuts. Saints Row 2 perfectly mixes humour and genuine drama in itself and it has that specific chilly, gloomy and original atmosphere I haven't seen in any other game yet.\n\nGraphics aren't bad - if you have a very powerful computer (and I really mean it - this game is badly optimized and that's the only defect I can think of, the game runs quite fine on my computer though, which is Intel Dual Core 2.5, 3 GB of RAM and GeForce 430 GT 1GB). Otherwise I agree - graphics are very bad. Driving seems to be clumsy, too, but if you get used to it, it ain't that bad.\n\nIf it weren't for these defects, I'd sincerely give this game 10/10. But due to these defects, I have to give it 9/10.\nOne of the best games of my life.","February 9, 2013","true","212.3"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/terzaerian/recommended/9480/","terzaerian","ж terzaerian ✌️","http://steamcommunity.com/id/terzaerian/","92 products in account","After a whirlwind tour of Saints Row the Third, IV, and Gat Out of Hell, I decided it was finally time to give the originals their fair shake - or at least Saints Row 2, the only one of the first two games currently ported to PC. I wanted to see where it had all begun, and what I'd heard from other fans about SR2's sandbox being even more expansive than the latter sequels was also encouraging. While there were also warnings of it being a bad port, I was reassured that the superlative mod pack by IdolNinja, Gentlemen of the Row, addressed many of the issues admirably, while broadening the base content of the game considerably. Needless to say, I was excited.\n\nHowever, I am finding myself disappointed with the game. Perhaps I have been spoiled by starting with the Third, but I get the sense that if I had started with Saints Row 2 I might never have glommed on to the series the way I have.\n\nThe first issue is vehicles. They're a huge part of Saints Row 2, and the game offers even greater customization of them than its sequels. None of that is enough to make up for their atrocious handling. Even with mods, there wasn't a moment when I wasn't cursing with frustration at them. Their amped up sensitivity makes any fine movement virtually impossible, which is pretty crucial if you're, say, piloting a helicopter at treetop level between buildings.\n\nSecond, are the activities. I thought that they were frustrating in SR3, but God DAMN, I didn't know what frustrating was until this. Each activity needs to be completed at least six times at ramping levels of difficulty to be fully completed, and there are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s of them. Activities that were easy and fun in SR3, such as Mayhem or Heli Assault, are soul-destroying exercises in futility here. I don't even want to think about what activities I hated from 3, like Escort, are like in 2,\n\nThird, the clothes. A lot of harumphing is made by veterans of the series about the superiority of 2's clothing system over its sequels, that it allows for layering and greater customization. The latter is partially true - most clothing has at least three parts that can be colored independently, and other items allow you to choose between a variety of logos to place on the same shirt. That said, the noise about layering is just that - noise. Overall the selection of clothing doesn't seem to be much greater than what you see in Planet Saints in the Third - in fact, it seems any one store in the Third has a greater variety of clothing than all the stores in this game.\n\nIt's a hard pill to swallow. This is a game I desperately want to enjoy. That said, I have a hard time seeing, if you're a veteran of the sequels or a newcomer to the series, what you will enjoy. Perhaps I'll think better of it after playing it more, but at present this possibility looks remote.","December 5, 2015","false","18.0"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","2","4","0","0"

Driving a car around is a joy, and there are many interesting environments to see (although not as varied as in San Andreas). A lot of weapons and vehicles, including flying ones too. The game is full of humour and the writing is okay, although not as good as in San Andreas, but the gameplay itself feels even better than in SA. Either way, if you like one game, then you will like the other, and if you have never played neither SR nor GTA, then SR2 is a good way to start.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/yukichigai/recommended/9480/","yukichigai","Y|yukichigai","http://steamcommunity.com/id/yukichigai/","463 products in account","All legends have to start somewhere.  The Saints Row series has become a major brand name in its own right, arguably outclassing the GTA series which it originally imitated.  Despite that, it didn't really rise to greatness in its first iteration.  No, what put Saints Row on the list of truly great series was its second offering, a dramatic improvement compared to the first game.  While later games in the series offered further improvements in some areas, there are several reasons why many Saints Row fans cite this game as the best the series has to offer, and one of the best Open World games ever made.  I'm not convinced it's the absolute best game on that measure, but it is at the very least in the top 5.\n\nWhy such high praise?  Quite simply, Saints Row 2 has a near perfect combination of gameplay and story elements which suit the Open World game style perfectly, some which are hard to find anywhere else.  Customizable vehicles, customizable player character, rich and varied minigames/diversions, an organically laid out city with surprising depth and complexity, wide variety of vehicles, weapons, and enemies, on and on and on.  There is an immense amount of content packed into this game beyond the core plot, which is long enough on its own.  Factor in the actual plot, the numerous side quests, activities, and diversions, and then cap it off with the sheer number of unmarked random distractions that Stilwater has to offer, and it soon it becomes clear just how much gameplay there is here, all of it fun.\n\nAnd speaking of the plot, let's talk about that briefly, without spoilers of course.  The game picks up directly from the last game, more or less anyway given that the player character has been in a coma for several years.  The former conquests of the Third Street Saints have come undone in the years since, and its up to the Protagonist to put the Saints back together and back on top of Stilwater's criminal heirarchy.  From there it goes a variety of places, some cliche, some over-the-top, a great many comedic, but also a good deal of legitimately dramatic places as well.  Many games have that variety of tone and seriousness, but I have to say that Saints Row 2 does one of the better jobs of balancing those elements.\n\nOf course no game is truly perfect, and Saints Row 2 has some flaws to be sure.  PC version and compatibility issues aside (which there are several), the game includes a few frustrating design choices, particularly when it comes to co-op play.  There are minor issues which the following games fixed, things like a complete lack of on-screen instructions for certain special control situations, like operating Tow Trucks.  Beyond that, one of the biggest issues is that virtually anything one player does in any kind of menu will in some way prevent the other player from doing certain things, or possibly will pause the game entirely.  One person accessing a car garage anywhere means the other will have to wait, and the same goes for some types of player customization.  The biggest issue though is the phone menu, a vital tool for certain side missions and diversions, will completely pause the game for both players, effectively locking one player out of the game entirely whenever the other dials the phone.  This is also true for anything off of the main game menu, and there are a lot of things which are.  It's honestly one of the worst problems in the Saints Row series, something which persists even through to the latest iteration.  Outside of design choices, certain missions and diversions have rather uneven difficulties at times, with everything progressing at tolerable difficulty until you reach one frustratingly picky/difficult part.  Many games have this issue, but the missions in Saints Row which suffer from it seem especially bad for some reason. Fortunately, none of these issues are absolute dealbreakers.  The game is still amazingly fun from start to finish.\n\nWhat anyone curious about Saints Row 2 should take away from my review is this: Saints Row 2 is a truly outstanding Open World crime game, one of the most fun examples of the genre.  While there may be better games in the genre out there, depending on your tastes, this is still the game which put the Saints Row series on the map as it were, establishing it solidly as a direct competitor to the then-untouchable GTA series.  If you like Open World games, you should give this one a try.  If you have any love of the Saints Row series, then you absolutely NEED to play this game.","May 17, 2015","true","54.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

BUT, it is an awful port, probably one of the worst ports in the history of modern PC games. Only recommended if you don't mind chasing after mods to fix games, bad framerates, poor visuals and a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of bugs all around. Even after installing the mods that make it playable (thanks Gentlemen of the Row Team and PowerTools for saving the game, and I really mean THANK YOU), the port still doesn't work how it should even with this mod, but it makes it playable, and adds better support for your controllers. Outside of this, other problems such as awful audio quality compared to the console versions make this awful port seem even worse. To make it even worse, because of the Gamespy shutdown a few years ago, one of the best features of this franchise, the full co-op, is unavilable over the internet unless you use a LAN tunneler.\n\nThis is the worst port I've ever played, and I have GTA IV PC. Buy it on console instead, no one will think less of you, the support for this game is dead anyway, with neither CD Projekt or Volition are acknowledging this game port exists, outside of a few ex-modders. An alternative is to just play Saints Row: The Third or Saints Row IV, as those are both solid games as well, with good ports, even if they aren't quite as good.\n\nIf the game played how it did with the mods I mentioned downloaded, I'd recommend this to everyone, it really is a brilliant game. What we got was a terrible port of a brilliant game, and no matter how good the game could be, it doesn't make up for what they released it as. Avoid, or buy it on XBOX 360 where the co-op and the game still works without any effort.","December 22, 2014","false","22.2"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

Although the graphics are outdated, the gameplay is surprisingly current.  Discover the story of how the Saints came to their current place in the gang world.  If you're an SR3 or SRIV fan, I highly recommend playing this game to complete the whole story and learn more about the nuances and small mentions of characters in other games.  If you have never played the franchise before - I would play SR3 or SRIV and come back to this gem.","July 11, 2015","true","4.1"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","2","5","0","0"
