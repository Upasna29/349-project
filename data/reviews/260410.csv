I was very, very let down.\n\nWorst part of the game, one of the "achievments" is to spend real money on orbs for the game, which seems idiotic. I'd rather just pay money for a real game. The least amount of money you can pay is a dollar, which isn't a lot, but this ENTIRE GAME isn't even worth a dollar. There are vastly superior flash games you can play for free on Kongregate. The item really worth buying in the game is 2 bucks, and seriously, this game is not worth two bucks. Also, the game is built to REQUIRE spending money in order to do well. It's just a huge grind. Pace is very very slow unless you spend money.\n\nThe game itself is incredibly simple. Only one level, and it's just waves of enemies coming at you, and you press the space bar at them. No joke. It just keeps going, and you're supposed to do this over and over and over, in hopes of unlocking more stuff, so you can press the space bar button even more times before dying.\n\nThere's also very little to the upgrade system. Every upgrade costs a LOT of in-game cash to get. There are only 3 guns, and 4 levels to each gun. You can also make your porch be able to take more hits (get more lives). Then there are three items to use in game (like freezing time). Considering how long it takes to get in-game cash, there is no way you would want to spend that much on a stupid one time use item. Very pointless system indeed.","November 15, 2014","false","2.4"," 126 of 159 people (79%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","79","126","159","2","0"

Besides that i can only imagine when the game process' further what damage may occour towards my keyboard.

Starts easy and chill but becomes challenging to even mindblowing insane. You know, I  read a bunch of reviews and most give a negative vibe. All for an achievement. One of the steam achievements require an ingame purchase. The lowest purchase I saw was like 0.39 € so that's not very much. I paid more for worse games.

Bland gameplay, exceedingly steep curve for weapon upgrade costs. It's very clear you're intended to spend money to make getting farther in the game feasible; the game WILL overwhelm you with impossible odds eventually, which no amount of button pressing is enough to overcome. Your weapon simply cannot fire fast enough to hurt some of the enemies, requiring you to lose, and hopefully have enough for an upgrade.\n\nThe combo scheme is one which punishes misses far more than it rewards hits.","November 16, 2014","false","0.3"," 20 of 30 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","20","30","0","0"

It was free, so I was going into it with a bit of skepticism. Right off the bat I can see, whether it is or not, it looks like a mobile port. I'm not finicky about graphics, but the menu itself was confusing. The screen was mostly empty space with icons in the corners. What do these icons do? You can't find out without trying them.\n\nVISUALS AND SOUND\nI won't dwell on this for very long, because its simply bad. Firstly your character doesn't move, he teleports between the lanes. Okay the graphics are kind of decent otherwise by free to play standards, but the sound design. The music is generic and repetetive, the guns are far too loud, and the ship sounds like the teleporter from Star Trek: TOS (that's kinda cool at first, but like the game, gets annoying).\n\nGAMEPLAY\nI'll admit I enjoyed the first half hour or so. Then it grew tedious, to the point that from then on I'd only play while listening to a podcast. There are two ways I can think to describe it. Its either Plants vs. Zombies without plants or Galaga with lanes. That's all there is to say really. There are also gun upgrades and power-ups, which are obtained by spending orbs earned by killing, but they don't seem to really do all that much.\n\nMICROTRANSACTIONS\nIf you're still with me I'll go on and say that I hate these with a passion. Especially when they can rack up to cost more than the game could possibly be sold for. You can buy the aforementioned orbs with real money. Except I don't see why you would. Even if you enjoy the game, the upgrades are basically what kept me going for as long as it did. What other motivation do you have? Well, I suppose there is one thing...\n\nACHIEVEMENTS\nThere are loads! But they're all really grindy. Now, you may be wondering what that ending of the last section was about. Well, there's a microtransaction achievement. Yeah. In order to "complete" this free game, you have to buy something in it. If you weren't already sure about whether you should or shouldn't get this, that should be enough.\n\nFINAL THOUGHTS\nOkay maybe its not all bad. It just needs some serious polish, but it would appear the devs have cast it aside. Its free, so you might as well pick it up just to try assuming you have the spare bandwidth.","November 3, 2015","false","1.2"," 12 of 18 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","12","18","0","0"

This is not multiplayer, nor a game that you need to work hard at, at all. If it was multiplayer, I'd say it was a P2W game, but it's not. So how in the world can microtransactions ruin the game if you have no competition that buys them and you don't to overpower you? Next, the amount of work needed... This game is so low key, I don't even know where to begin. You're playing an old man who's mad at aliens for being in his yard. All I can remember is the Walking Dead from this really. I like it because it's a nice change from all the big games out there these days. Not everyone will like it, true, but don't blame it on microtransactions when you don't need them or it being too difficult because you have to earn soooooo many orbs to get anything.","November 24, 2014","true","0.6"," 28 of 51 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","28","51","0","0"

It plays a lot like Galaga in that you fight waves of enemies on a checkerboard style level where you shoot projectiles (in this case a firearm) to destroy the incoming hostiles. It's set up in waves in the old arcade space shooter style, and really the light hearted old grandpa character with his muzzle loader blasting away aliens adds to the overall bright cartoon aesthetic of the game. You can also upgrade your arsenal by collecting orbs and purchasing them in the shed with new weapons like a shotgun. The enemies vary as well, as you progress through the levels, so it becomes more diverse and challenging.

So even if you have already passed that wave, you don't know what's coming! It is NOT a pay to win sort of game but that option is there. Instead of forcing you to spend money on power-ups like other games (Angry Birds,Candy Crush.) You can spend the orbs that you earn on them. Though the power-ups are very expensive aswell with upgrades. This is not the only "bad" part of the game. Gathering orbs is really a pain is the ♥♥♥. It takes FOREVER. If I had to sum up this game in one word, that word would be "Grindy" That is because the whole plot of the game is based on grinding ideas. But even though the grindy aspect of the game is a downfall, I still would recommend this game. It is a "pass the time" kind of game like PacMan!\n\nMy Rating would be 6.5/10","December 6, 2014","true","1.7"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

You can only compete highscores with your friendslist. If this is multiplayer to you, then I think you've been playing the wrong kind of games.\n\nThis game is a lot of fun, but sadly at this point I wish it was possible to give mixed reviews.\n\nThe progession is EXTREMELY slow in here.\nGame starts eary, around round 5 or so SOME speed gets added.\n\nAt round 8 it suddenly becomes unbearable to even keep up due to the fact it takes FOREVER to collect orbs to upgrade your stuff into better weaponry. I mean, you unlock your raygun for instance. This costs  2000 orbs. To upgrade it, it costs around 9000 orbs.\nYou earn around 600 orbs a match you play, counting you won't get past round 9 because suddenly loads of tanks you can't just take down. It's a long and tedious thing and just becomes WAY too repeatative.\n\nSure the game is fun, but at some point it becomes so tedious and boring that you just stop playing.\n\nThat or you've got to be willing to put money into the game or spam your social media for a mere +50 orbs a round.\nAnd personally, this game really is not worth the micro transactions.

The game is pretty simple; move left and right and kill aliens as they enter your yard, and protect you house by killing them before they reach the porch.  No limits on ammo, but also not many weapons; musket for longer range, shotgun for more power and closer range kills, and a ray gun which I don't know what is special about it yet.\n\nIt's a fun game if you are just looking to kill a little bit of time, but not something you can really get all that engrossed into.

I do wish there was a pay version if I wanted to support the developers without buying in game currency. Even with playing level 1 - Death over and over again there is some variety in the pattern of the aliens spawning. With that I do wish every 5-ish levels the scenery would change, as well as the music. It would make for something cool to look at and listen to. Overall a great game and time killer, needs a little more to be amazing without paying the premium price.","November 20, 2014","true","3.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

If you play lots of serious games then this may be a fantastic game you could play once in a while to take the load off because this is a more silly and funny type game that you could even invite a kid to play!

It's like Plants VS Zombies and Space Invaders married and had a child, and this game is their child. You controll Murray and you need to shoot at the aliens coming at your home using different ranged weapons: they'll teleport from their U.F.O. at the opposite side of your garden and start walking torwards the building where you are (and where you'll shoot them), if three or more of them manage to reach your house you'll get abdupted.\nThe game is pretty easy to play but REALLY hard to master, it has really a simple low-poly 3D graphic and a happy soundtrack (the aliens' and Murray's sound effects are pretty funny). It's good, it gets a bit repetitive sometimes and also REALLY HARD later in the game but I still suggest you to give it a try if you liked Plants VS Zombies or old arcade alien shooters.","February 14, 2015","true","0.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Pulling the trigger first has drawn Murray in to full scale war with these alien visitors, and they’ll stop at nothing to destroy him. Armed with his musket and inconsolable rage, Murray must defend his home against all odds. Why are the aliens only attacking this one house? Who knows?! Shoot first and ask questions later in this endless fast paced arcade shooter, and keep those pesky aliens off of Murray's perfectly manicured lawn!\n\nCollect valuable alien orbs to upgrade your weaponry. Use ‘Cane Time’, ‘Infuriate’, and ‘Soundwave’ power-ups to gain the upper hand when all seems lost. The longer Murray holds the lawn, the stronger those aliens get. But there is plenty of firepower waiting for you to try out in The Shed.\n\nSo, lock and load…and Get Off My Lawn!","February 15, 2015","true","0.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","1"

The enemies only get health upgrades, they don't shoot back at you, and you are limited to only left and right controls to fend them off. I was a cute concept with the whole "First Contact gone amuck due to first impressions", but the gameplay is pretty lackluster for the most part as all it boils down to is "move sideways, shoot until target dies". Sure, you can buy weapons and upgrades, but they do nothing to alter the gameplay aside from allowing you to survive longer.","November 24, 2014","false","0.5"," 4 of 11 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","4","11","0","0"

I would probally play more if it was a bit more interesting. Also, Steam classifies this as 'Free', and normally when it does that, there are no microtransactions, but this time there is. I hate microtransactions... But I would recommend this game just to try it out like I did, you never know, you might love it and spend hundreds of pounds/dollars/etc on it!","November 13, 2014","true","0.2"," 3 of 11 people (27%) found this review helpful","27","3","11","0","0"

This game is just a down time game. If your board and you don't have anything else to play.\n\nSo really this is a good game. Its not the best for hard core gamers.

First of all, the game has no end. The functional end of the game is round 25, and the key to getting lots of cash is maintaining a high wultiplier. You can get several thousand 'orbs' after about ten rounds so long as you honor the need for accuracy. It's a free game, one which, instead of displaying ads to compensate for the price tag, sells in game currency for those who want it. The gameplay is great, with or without the microtransactions. There are no features you have to pay for or anything (though I hear cards aren't handed out unless you buy something) so I don't know why people are so aggravated by it. The devs need their coffee!\n\nThat's not to say it doesn't give the P2W people an edge. Buying currency expediates things, but victory can still be earned rather than bought.","November 12, 2014","true","1.5"," 4 of 14 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","4","14","0","0"

I then decided, I may as well download the game to at least give it a try, I mean it's free to play right?\nI was pleasantly surprised by what I had played. The gameplay is smooth, the enemies are actually quick challenging before Level 10 unlike most Tower Defense games, and the concept of the game is very amusing, especially the odd one liners the character says during the game.\nThe only real complaints I have are the graphics, the rendering of the game and the powerups. Some of the armored aliens sometimes left the armor hovering after they die, the main menu graphics are quite poor. In terms of the powerups, there could be a lot more powerups, and you should be able to access the store mid game instead of waiting for the game over.\nHowever this is a quality game, with good humour and gameplay, and is good for when you want to play a less stressfull game.\nI would give this a 7.5/10, possibly and 8 if it recieves updates in the future. I seriously reccomend this game for any Indie gamers!","November 17, 2014","true","0.5"," 3 of 12 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","3","12","0","0"

I've played this game for about seven hours now and have had a blast doing so, I don't have a lot of complaints and I highly suggest you check this game regardless. There is one very simple reason I cannot recommend this as a completionist, because one of the achievements is no longer accessible due to the company's microtransaction servers no longer being managed. You cannot purchase orbs anymore, and one of the achievements is not possible to unlock without a purchase using real money, and therefore you cannot get said achievement. The multiplayer servers are also down so playing with friends is also not an option anymore, and people who are new to the game like myself will not be able to do so. If you don't have a problem with not earning every single achievement, as I myself do, I would recommend this game to you as the gameplay is super simplistic and enjoyable, but I can't recommend this to completionists as it's just impossible to get all the achievements. I would easily change my recommendation to Yes if the game either has the achievement removed or the servers are re-opened.\n\n\n\nThis has been an EqualJones review, thank you for reading and have fun!","January 19","false","7.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You play as a old man shooting aliens who get on your lawn. Sounds fun right! It's not.\n\nThe game has the look of Plants Vs Zombies, your character is behind the fence however and you scroll left to right shooting the enemies before they can get to you. The controls aren't horrible but they are little odd I though. A and D move you left to right while space shoots and various other keys use your power ups. Graphically the game looks like it was made for phones and I believe it was previously a free online flash game. So don't go in expecting anything nice to look at.\n\nNow gameplay in here is one of the main things that kills it. The game is slow and foremost is just boring. At first the enemies come so slowly and you can kill them quick enough to have seconds between enemies. Then the further levels when the enemies are more powerful you just become out numbered. There isn't a middle ground. There are also only three different types of enemies that only differ based on HP and armor.\n\nThe game does attempt to have a upgrade system that is by far one of the worst in quite some time. It seems to be made with the hopes that you'll just buy in game currency since you collect it so slowly that the will to want to keep playing will be gone long before your get more then one upgrade. Add into effect that they amount you'll need for each upgrade gets so spaced out that it would take forever to get them.\n\nOverall it seems very clear why Get Off My Lawn is free and even with that price tag I'd like my time back.\n\n\nScore :\n\n\n1/10\n\nhttp://apocalypticdemise.com/2016/03/05/get-off-my-lawn-review/","March 5","false","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Who did ever alowed that crap to enter the store?\n\nWithout it (and with a bit more focus on actual gameplay instead) it would be prety decent and fun game.\n\nI actually realy enjojed it for about first five minutes - that is before I noticed that I will have really hard time advancing anywhere futher without paying for it.

People complain about repetitive play... Remember the old days where you had to play the same race over and over again in NFS or Test drive off road in order to get the cash to buy a vehicle only to play that track again with the new vehicle? If the game isn't fun to you, than playing it over and over again isn't going to be that fun. Paying to advance your play is what makes this game free to begin with. Yes, I would rather pay a few bucks up front and have the full game, but you could actually beat this without paying money. The achivements are actually a fair grind. It is easy to kill each alien type, but in certain situations with certain weapons makes them more like achievements and less of playing it for hours on end and unlocking everything. It reminds me of the old put in a quarter style arcade games of the past. Oh and it worked great with the arcade joystick I own (used joytokey) and plan to try this game with my x-arcade when I get the cabinet back up and running. Its a fun time waster with arcade like feel to it.\n\nOnly complaint I have is that the store is currently broken. Is there a way to contact the developers? Just repeatedly says failed to contact host. I don't even know how much things cost because I cannot connect. Would like to support them, but cannot if the feature is broken.\n\nI would recommend this game to someone who truly loves the arcade games of the past and doesn't mind level grinding. Even with real money purchases, I imagine you are going to be playing this for hours before unlocking everything. Its worth a look for a free to play game, just don't expect to beat it and get all achievements in one sitting.","May 22","true","5.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
