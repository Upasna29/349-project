It’s inspired by Limbo and Oddworld games. You play as a girl who has crash landed on an alien planet. Just like Limbo you only see a black silhouette of the girl character and only her eyes are visible. The whole theme however is not all black/white/grey like Limbo. You can see yellow color of what appears to be the sun in the background, and other colored creatures like a bee etc.\n\nGraphics:\n\nThe graphics are similar to Limbo but not exactly, this game has color instead of all black and white. It’s very atmospheric and you get that same feeling of loneliness you got from Limbo, except it’s even creepier as you’re on another planet with aliens lurking about. There is no option for adjusting resolution and for me the game started in 720p, this could be a problem. I was getting 50-60 FPS the whole time I played.\n\nSound:\n\nJust like the graphics are, sounds are incredibly atmospheric as well. The slow music, the creepy wind and crows in the background really gives the chills.\n\nGameplay:\n\nGameplay is very similar to Limbo, the movement, the jumping is very similar to how Limbo handles. Not that it’s a bad thing, in my opinion Limbo had really good gameplay. You can run around, jump, climb ledges etc. You have to solve puzzles and sneak around. You are always hiding from enemies in this game. Pressing space makes you interact with the objects or you can walk on toes also by pressing space key. This sneaky walk on toes is required to avoid enemies hearing you. It is a sort of survival game where basically everything is trying to kill you but it’s linear so you must keep progressing through episodes.\n\nGraphics: 7/10\nSound: 7/10\nGameplay: 8/10\nOverall: 7/10\n\nConclusion:\n\nFun little game which is heavily inspired from Limbo. I quite enjoyed it. There are a few bugs and problems but nothing too major. There is also no option to select resolution and bind keys. Other than these the game is fun to play and will remind you of Limbo a lot.","May 12","true","1.8"," 19 of 20 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","19","20","0","6"

There's some great set-pieces here, the best of which involves being captured by the terrifying resident Neanderthal tribe and your subsequent escape from their cave but while much of the art direction and atmospherics are on point, the entire experience sometimes feels overly derivative. There's no real reason for your character to be a copy of the glowing-eyed silhouette boy from Limbo. His anonymity was a major point of that game's story; here, you see the girl's face and hear her voice several times.\n\nA lot of work has gone into OddPlanet over the past couple of years from its original sole chapter and it arrives on Steam with another two in tow. It's not enough really; there doesn't feel like there's any real resolution at the end of the game which, for an experience that relies heavily on its plot to balance its plain platforming and puzzles, will leave some players feeling a bit short-changed.\n\nStill, I can't really not give this a recommendation based on the complaint that I really wanted to play more of it, can I?\n\nFull review below:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J59PEa50p14","May 14","true","1.3"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","92","11","12","3","0"

Not only was the story touching but it was also visually pleasing.\n\nIf you've enjoyed Limbo and have a knack for platforming around unknown worlds with mushroomey,  and spiderly things trying to kill you or overally looking icky, thou should be satisfied.","May 11","true","3.3"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

Find the items, figure out what they do, and solve the puzzles. The game is split into three episodes and the whole game takes 2-3 hours, depending on how fast you solve the puzzles.\n\nThe game tells a story of a little girl who crash lands on an... Odd Planet. She tries to find her way and create a life for herself.\n\nI love the story of the game. Pepito is my favourite. And I recommend playing! It is a nice way to spend two or three hours.","May 16","true","2.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Limbo had a sister.....\n\nAnd strangely she dies a lot too :)\n\nIt looks ok ,very similar to Limbo in looks and gameplay which is not a bad thing as that was a great small game .\n\nI'm not recommending this game just yet until the dev explains to us if and when he's gonna fix\nthe game settings .\nThere aren't any :)  ,so you can't change the resolution or keys .\nGlovepie can be used to change the keyboard settings but we shouldn't have to resort to third party progs.\n\nI mean if this is it then fair enough , just tell us please .\n\nEDIT:\nOk ,dev was kind enough too reply and said there's a limitation with the Fusion game engine that is making it very difficult to have adjustable resolutions.\nThere are a few game engines that have  issues with resolutions.\nIt's something you get used to when playing a lot of point and clicks. :)\n\nAnyways game deserves a Thumbs UP  from me .\n\nIs it worth the £3.99 i paid ? Most definitely imho , especially if you enjoyed the art style and gameplay of Limbo .\nThough gameplay is not as intricate as Limbo ,it's mainly jumping , pushing and collecting items.\n\nBut hey £3.99 is the price of a Big Mac so it's priced relatively cheap.\n\nIt's like the little sister or maybe a love letter to that game :)","May 17","true","0.4"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","3"

I wasn't dissapointed, couple of minor issues, there arnt any settings to change resolution, and no volume controls however the game does make for an immersive experience.
