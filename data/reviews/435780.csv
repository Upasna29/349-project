It really reminds me of gaming back in the old days where completing a mission gives immense satisfaction and starting a more difficult mission gives you a little bit of dreadfulness.\n\nArt style is brilliany and refreshing. Definately a game I'll enjoy playing stoned.","January 21","true","8.6"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","64","7","11","2","0"

I got so immersed in the game and it reminded me of the time I watched Interstellar and The Martian. The depiction of space was amazing.

Controls are tough and the journey even tougher, Frustrating at times, completing missions gives a feeling of satisfaction, even to the point of bragging rights.\n\nThe game brings back nostalgia when spoon feeding gamers were never in game design and players were treated intelligently. Not to mention the wonderful art style and soundtracks, The feeling of isolation like Gravity is always looming as I play.\n\nI would love to see a leaderboard if possible.","January 25","true","2.1"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

I couldn't even finish the tutorial lol but I did manage to finish the first level after so many tries and on the attempt that I actually completed it, I wasn't even trying to beat it, but when I did it felt so rewarding and such an acomplishment.\n\nVIOLET: Space Mission is clearly made for a touchscreen device such as a phone or tablet, hence the challenging controls on PC, but it does make for a fun game to pass time. Though, I would highly suggest to get it on sale.","February 26","true","1.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","0"

Definitely my kind of game.  It doesn't do a great job of it though.  It's very very frustrating to play and it looks like it was made for a phone or tablet which it clearly was.","January 20","false","5.3"," 3 of 11 people (27%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","27","3","11","2","0"
