The game has moments of fun and mediocre action sprinkled on top of a lot of walking and grinding for your next level or weapon. It feels like the good start of a game that still needs more effort to make it entertaining than just grinding to that next level.\n\nOn the surface, the game looks good, it has that quirky style where you can play as a shark or literal elephant man among real characters. Purchase a shark rocket launcher among typical shotguns, assault rifles and melee weapons. Rescue pandas from cages, stop the slaughter of innocent alligators. Animals wear Christmas hats at least during the season and the game on paper feels like it evokes fun and charm. Maybe that's all a game really needs, guns and hats.\n\nThe animation is serviceable for the price, but the glaring issue is that the menus lack refinement. They're basic boxes with buttons. Some of the menus feel rushed or modified to push the game out the door. That can all change over time.\n\nYour job is simple, defeat the bosses from each base. There are other quest objectives like free twenty animals from cages, kill two hundred enemies. Your home base is at the center of the map, making each enemy base easy to walk to without getting lost. Its a simple straight forward game that gets dull in a hurry.\n\nDeath will respawn you at your home base, but its the depleting meter at the bottom of the screen that will make you have a game over. Rescuing animals and killing poachers is the only way to replenish the meter.\n\nThe environment is a single exterior map that is lush and green, full of grass, trees and bamboo. There is no water or anything to hinder your path until you get into a base.  This can make every walk mundane, especially if you clear out a base only to die at the boss. Enemies in bases stay dead, well that is unless you save, exit and resume the game. Then the enemies are all back. What makes having no enemies so boring is that each base takes a minute to walk to and then around the third or forth base, they take a minute to walk through winding paths of sandbags and tents.\n\nOutside of bases, enemies will spawn in when you're elsewhere. You will only encounter one or two at a time every fifteen seconds. Its a lot more efficient just to run past them. However, there is an experience and gold economy here, so if you want to get better, you'll need to stop and kill everyone foe you encounter. Sometimes enemies helicopter in, but even then you can murder them in a flash. There needs to be more battles otherwise the boredom sets in rather quick.\n\nInside a base there are sentries with both machine guns and seeking rockets. The rockets are interesting, because they only detonate on living things like the player, animals, enemies and themselves. You can get a homing missile to detonate on the sentry that shot it. What's even more quirky is they will float stuck in cages unable to get around them, but unable to explode.\n\nBosses begin to feel cheap. They have short range attacks that sometimes glitch where a punch can hit you quite a distance away. After the first few, they become dangerous, put you in a corner of the arena, stun you and pummel you. Your character is stiff and slow even if its still faster than other enemies. So each boss's dash becomes dangerous. Later bosses have enemies helicopter in, but that's the easy part. The game recycles boss sprites, but the overall pattern is the same for every boss. Melee, dash; no matter if they use a chainsaw or their fists.\n\nBanHammer is easy to control with a keyboard or a controller. You can shoot, change weapons, reload, see a map, toggle your mini map, throw grenades, light a flare to bring you to base camp and toggle a help function. Holding a specific button will lock your direction so you can run east while shooting west.\n\nYou can only shoot west or east, which is fine. Its like an old school brawler with guns. Most enemies have the same restriction, but other enemies will shoot north when they're facing west. It just looks awkward. The issue that I have is sometimes I'll be shooting east, then my character will turn west. The controls seem very sensitive like there is no dead zone for an analog controller. Perhaps that's the real reason behind having a button to lock your direction.\n\nThere are plenty weapons in the game each with their own damage and firing rate. Its easy to unlock a powerful weapon early in the game and just stick with it the whole way through. Everything you craft is waiting for you in your inventory at the shop. There's no way to change your inventory on the fly and by inventory I mean you have five guns, but you can only carry three.\n\nAlthough there's a shop and crafting station at your base, there's no ammunition or health. To get those you need to go out and kill things. Foes carry all sorts of ammunition, health, grenades and other bonuses.\n\nOne of the interesting parts of the game is a day and night system. You can stay awake all day and all night, but they need their sleep. So you can get the drop on them when they're snoozing at camp or elsewhere on the ground. Your shotgun must have a silencer on it, because no one wakes up when you're killing their comrades next to them.\n\nIf you're playing solo, you can have a companion animal that's downright useless. I suppose the animal provides a distraction from further enemies that are too far to shoot you, but even then you're much faster than the companion. When you leave your dog in the dust, it respawns under your feet. Rather than moving the dog to the side, you're the one that gets pushed to the side. It becomes tough having the puppy with you during a boss battle, because the dog gets in the way. Its just a silly frill to have.\n\nThere are plenty of invisible walls. If you try to walk beyond the overall map, you're blocked. A wall of trees would be nice or some indication that you need to go back. Even hardcore indestructible gun turrets would be interesting. Other than an invisible map border, the bases have gaps in their walls, but they too are just invisible walls.\n\nOther issues include occasional times when I am running and I stop, the run animation continues. Sometimes the gun refuses to reload even when I have more ammunition. If I press it a few dozen times, then it works. A chopper can land with enemies, I throw a grenade, it explodes, then the enemies get out and die from the explosion. Its interesting. Calling for a helicopter freezes the player, so make sure you're a safe distance from hostiles.\n\nBanHammer just still feels hollow spread out across two hours of time. It wears out its welcome past the first five or ten minutes through repetition and an empty experience devoid of challenge until the cheap boss fights. Most of the time I was grinding to level up to the point I could beat a boss. Leveling up unlocks new characters, but when the game is dull why would I want to play more of it?\n\nIts still a good start for a good price that I would say will grow over time, but this is the BanHammer's full release and it still has a lot of issues. As for recommending it right now, its a coin toss.","January 7","false","2.8"," 28 of 34 people (82%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","82","28","34","2","0"

The game allows you to select one of three characters (however you unlock two more later) and gives you the task of saving the animals from poachers. The gameplay is simple; just moved around the map eliminating enemies with whichever guns you have at your disposal. The game allows you to carry around three weapons at a time, those being a primary, pistol and melee weapon. Melee weapons are useless against most enemies, and you'll take more damage than it's worth. Pistols can also hold their own, however your real firepower will be your primary. These vary from assault rifles, sniper rifles, SMGs, shotguns, and there's even a missile launcher shaped like a shark! The graphics also suit the game; it's very simple, but the art style brings out the colour in the environment.\n\nPROS\nFun combat\nOnly being able to shoot horizontally gives the game an extra challenge\nWide variety of weapons\nEasy-to-use crafting interface\nPlenty of collectables\nSimple objectives to complete which add some challenge\nCollecting the character's backstories through progress was interesting\nCONS\nMost of the time playing was walking from point to point\nThere's no difference between the characters, except for Elfire, who is poorly designed\nBosses lack variety\nBanHammer suffers from a difficulty spike about three quarters into the game\nSummary:\nBanHammer is a great game to play for short amounts of time, as the gameplay is a little too repetitive to finish in one sitting. However the game is still worth a play for anyone looking for a small, casual experience.\n\nRating:\nI'd give BanHammer a 7/10.\n\nWant more recommendations?

The graphics and design are cool but the game is very repetative. You run around killing poachers and protecting animals. The scenery changes slightly but not enough add to the game. I got this game in a bundle and would not have spent the money to purchase this game otherwise.

You shoot in the direction you are moving (right or left) no matter where the mouse pointer is, which was, for me, a little hard to get a hang of in the beginning. The controls in general aren't much to get excited about. There are some annoying moments in-game aswell. You can get stuck in objects if a boss is above you and "push" you down, and since can only shoot left or right, you pretty much die. But there are positives in this as well. It has charming graphics, not very sharp, but charming. There isn't much of a story other than "animals die because of poachers, kill every human you see". You get in-game quests that help you get money. In the beginning, cash is hard to come by, it isn't until you start killing bosses and saving the captured animals around their base, you start to feel a little richer. With the cash you get new weapons, and there is a good selection of weapons in the game. But it doesn't take long until you start feel that there is no direction in the game, and it's just grinding to get a new weapon, which you want to try on a boss you already killed before. But in the end; Decent game, but not much more. Alot more fun if you play with a friend. 5.4/10","March 19","true","6.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Horrible controls! A patch for it would make a thumbs up.\n\nI choose not to ask for a refund after playing this game, but I seriously considered doing it, even if I got it on sale. The only reason I did not is that this game has potential; the concept is great, the main ideas are interesting, and saving animals is an interesting cause rarely found in video gaming.\n\nWhat is wrong, however, are the abominable controls. You fire in the direction you are walking unless you press a touch which allows to fire in the reverse direction. Now what happens when you stop moving? I haven't figured out yet. This system is very, very, very annoying. When you have to fight a boss in a very restricted area, you need to turn around again and again and that makes this reverse shooting system absolutely horrible. I understand that it may be interesting to not make a purely twin stick game -though I think it would have been funnier- but at least, making two different keys to shoot, one in one direction and the other in the other, would have been greatly appreciated.\n\nThere are some glitches, too, as you may happen to be stuck in a wall (between two tents). But the main problem are the controls.\n\nI still hope that the developers may happen to read this review and seriously consider making a patch for these really bad controls. This hope is the only reason why I didn't ask for a refund, as this game could really become a great little one.\n\n","May 9","false","0.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/recommended/423840/","Steamified","Warwick J.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/","3916 products in account","Upon loading up and getting started with BanHammer it becomes quite clear that I am a little out of my depths as a solo player in a game intended to be played with a friend as a local co-op game. That isn’t to suggest that the game isn’t soloable, it certainly is once you learn how to play the game. However, you may not find the game as entertaining as if you did play in a group. With this line of thought I'll site the Borderlands games as comparable (better with friends than solo). If you do have friends to join you then you’re really going to be in for a treat. The ability to kill mob after mob after mob while rescuing animals being attacked by game hunters is a lot of fun.\n\nThe graphics are perfect for what the game needs, the sound is fine and the game play is smooth. You will find some people complaining about bugs and other annoyances in the game but in my time with the game I did not notice anything out of the ordinary which correlates to the more recent or updated reviews who claim that a patch repaired the game.\n\nThere are a wide variety of weapons and other tools/power ups that players can utilize and although you are thrown in from the deep end, a lack of tutorial hurts the game, once you begin to understand what you are doing in regards to the quests the game opens up.\n\nIt’s an easy game to recommend to those of you who enjoy action games especially for the price. However do note that the game was bundled in its greenlight phase and that’s generally a sign that the game will ultimately find itself in another bundle sooner than later. Still, this one is worth the small price especially if you can get into that local co-op.\n\nFor more reviews similar to this and regular giveaways please visit http://www.steamified.com/","January 8","true","4.3"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","7","13","0","0"

It's not the best of games although it can be pretty annoying with trying to get an achievement which is unattainable. I have reset this because I thought it could be a bug and put in more hours than I expected to put in to find that I cannot get the achievement for all of the quests. This game is very repetitive and it is annoying that you are only able to shoot left and right, whereas the enemies can attack you from all sides. The storyline is terrible where it is only 3 paragraphs per each character and all the parts can be found at the exact same place as the last one (all you need to do is restart the map) Not to mention the "partner"... The dog is almost completely useless and tends to get in the way a lot, the only good part about having the partner is getting in the way when you are against the boss that has a machine gun.\n\n5/10","May 16","false","19.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
