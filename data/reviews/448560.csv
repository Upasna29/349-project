Here it`s necessary to think. And you have to think a lot. The game is really very,very difficult.\n\nPros:\nExtremely hard puzzle set;\npuzzles of varying difficulty;\nlong gameplay\n\nCons:\ngraphics – for mobile phones;\nyou can't kill anyone.\n\nConclusion.\nIf you love chess, math, logic, like to think – this game for ya.\nIf not, then better don't buy it, because you may end up on the first puzzle.\n\n\nFully:\n\nThe plot.\nProceed directly to the game.\nSome kinds of puzzles I can`t pass in principle.\nThe entering puzzle which solves 1 out of 10 as stated by developer. I don`t know for sure (will see on\nthe achievements stats), but I spent about 15 minutes for solving it and 10 of them I tried to understanddependence of the color changes when clicks on this or other square. By the way, my wife couldn’t solve\nit)))\n\nGenerally, I've seen about 15 kinds of puzzles. Puzzles description I will give below.\n\nPuzzles (sorted by my preference):\n-Chess puzzle. Various tasks with chess pieces. Solved 5 pieces. How much whole is unknown.\n. Difficulty - impossible.\n-Honeycombs and Balls and (in the achievement is Hex and Infection). Two different puzzles, but the\nmechanics are similar. Difficulty – average.\n-Battleship, battleship and Minesweeper (two different puzzles). It is necessary to place the ships on thebattlefield. Difficulty - high.\n- Chinese checkers. You need to remove all the checkers from the Board. Difficulty - average.\n- Ordinary checkers. Usually you need to change the white/black checkers for a limited number of\nmoves. Difficulty - high.\n- Coins. I've seen two types of puzzles. Pick up the last coin and flip all the coins. Difficulty - high.\n- Billiards. Need to drive the ball in the right pocket.\n- Puzzles with pictures (similar to first). Everyone besides the first I skipped. Difficulty - impossible!\n- 15 puzzle. Difficulty - high.\n- The game is similar to 15 puzzle. Mechanics like 15 puzzle. Difficulty – high\n- The Rubik's cube. Difficulty - impossible. Could not solve any one, all skipped.\n- Packer (judging by the name this is what you need) something like Tetris. Need to pack all of the\nshapes in the playing field. Difficulty - impossible!\n- Domino. You need to correctly place the dominoes on the playing field. Difficulty - impossible!. All skipped.\n\nI've seen not all the puzzles if to believe to the list of achievements.","March 4","true","13.0"," 28 of 32 people (88%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","88","28","32","6","0"

For example, the one about dice says to click on an adjecent die to "move" in that direction. However, the puzzle fails to even tell you what the objectinve of the puzzle is. I spent ten minutes randomly clicking on dice until I passed (somehow). On two-player boards, the AI plays ridiculously well (and you always play first), so you spend the entire board playing defensively against a tough opponent.\n\nOverall, the game isn't fun.","April 17","false","0.6"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","13","15","0","0"

You will recognize some of them, while others may be new to you. Look at the screenshots to get an idea of the kind of problems you will be solving. I think most of them are fun, but some are just frustrating. Yeah, I'm looking at you, "swap the bishops".\n\nYes, I clicked the button to recommend this game, but just barely. 'Mind Games' has a lot of problems. To be blunt, for the most part it comes across as pretty amateurish:\n\n- There is no in-game menu whatsoever. No basic options e.g. for graphics and sound, but also no menu that shows your progress or that allows you to go back to previous puzzles you may want to replay because you liked them. You have three buttons in-game: one to exit mind games, one to show the instructions for the current level on the screen and one to reset the current level. There is also no hint system or another way to progress in 'Mind Games' when you're stuck at one particular level. Well, because there is an achievement for skipping a level I went looking for the way to do that. Turns out the 'hint' you see in the second screenshot on this product page, i.e. "You can skip the level by pressing left-top reset button 100 times" is no joke. Not very user-friendly, is it?\n\n- The whole audio track is just copied from the game 'The 7th Guest' (also available on Steam). I can't help but wonder if this is even legal, but that's not up to me to look into. But more to the point, 'The 7th Guest' was set in a haunted mansion so the creepy sounds, the ominous music and the maniacal laughter fit that atmosphere. But in 'Mind Games', where you're just solving brain teasers, it feels completely out of place.\n\n- The instructions you get for each brain teaser are written in very bad English. Sometimes this causes you to have no clue at all what you're supposed to do and you'll need to figure it out by trial and error, or by looking up the solution on the net, which spoils the fun, of course. 'Mind games' adresses the player as 'my friend', just like in those terrible e-mails you get when buying something from the countries er... 'on the eastern side of the planet' (Russia, India, China, ...). They don't understand the western side of the globe thinks it's weird to call any and all strangers "my friend".\n\n- Some of the Steam Achievements are bugged. E.g. there are some achievements that require you to complete 40, 100 and 200 levels, but the counters for those 3 achievements is stuck at 6 for me and, according to the discussions forum, for a number of other players, too. According to the same forum, other achievements used to be bugged but were fixed, so maybe the current bugged achievements will get fixed in the near future, as well.\n\nSo there you have it. If you like challenging brain teasers and find 'Mind Games' on sale, you have little to lose by buying it. But 'Mind Games' really needs some more work to stop it from sticking out like a sore thumb in the huge selection of puzzle games Steam has to offer. Most notably it needs original and better suited music and sound effects, an in-game menu with at least some basic options and a native English speaker to rewrite the instructions which are hard to understand as they are right now.","May 19","true","8.4"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

It's fun and intersting and at this point in time the developers are really active with the game and fixing any issues that pop up, which does happen sometimes. This is a very enjoyable game which, depending on how good you are at puzzles, may cause the game to last for a very long time for you (with some of the puzzles seeming to be very complex to figure out).\n\nNow for the negatives:\n- Some of the puzzles seem extremely similar to each other and once you figure out how to solve the puzzle it becomes very simple to do so. So, if two puzzles have the same solution despite it being two seperate puzzles it feels like you're only solving one.\n- The puzzles in the game aren't all exactly original so it's possible you may have already seen one or more of these puzzles before, personally I've seen a few puzzles I already knew how to solve due to having done them years before.\n- While this game is advertised as "extremely hard brain twisting puzzles" some of them are so simple a child could do it. This is not an exaggeration, my last point about having played some of these puzzles years ago is a perfect example. I can easily remember solving some of these puzzles as a child and not having any real challenges doing so.\n- Currently (March 7, 2016) while the game does say it has Steam trading cards it actually does not have any. EDIT: Cards have been added.\n- This game has a very small repetitive sound file with little to no background noise.\n\nAll that being said if you are a fan of puzzle games these  puzzles may not be as hard as described but they are challenging as well as fun and this game is certainly enjoyable for what it is.","March 7","true","3.9"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

The best exemple to describe this is like "Take the Tic-Tact-Toe game, write some code that make the AI invincible an then present the game as challenging". Unfortunately Mind Games starts from a very good and simple ideea but fails to deliver something that is both fun and difficult at the same time. The main complaints are:\n- For quite a few puzzles the objective is not clearly stated (ex. for Nim levels, it doesn't say what are the conditions for winning - I had to google Nim in order to figure it out)\n- The AI is ridiculously difficult for the firts levels\n- The "Skip" button is a joke (really?!!!)\n- It was that hard to provide a way to revisit previous levels? Or it was intentionaly ?\n\nSorry for bad gramma etc\n\nThe conclusion: the game should have been polished a litlle bit before release and the description is misleading","May 24","false","9.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The downside here is that you have to solve them in order, one at a time.  You can skip one if you're having difficulty or just don't happen to like it, but you have to click a certain spot 100 times.  There is no way of returning to a previously solved puzzle.  It would be so much more fun if you could just pick any  puzzle you feel like doing.  Nevertheless, I recommend Mind Games for the puzzles and the good price.","May 22","true","66.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I'm 10 in and I've gotten\n\n1) 15 Square\n2) Ataxx\n3) Jigsaw puzzles\n4) Lights out or Lights tinted (think RGB into creating an image of the same color)\n5) Magic Squares (all Horizontals/Verticals/Diagonals are a # using various things like dice, dominoes, or cards)\n6) Flip the bishops without having a bishop kill a bishop of another color\n7) Lots of Chinese Checker type puzzles\n\n\nThey are pretty much random... some are simple, some complicated, some are WTF am I doing and why would you play this? Because your a puzzle master... or claim to be one on TV... I love it because you think... you swear at it, then you solve it and go "Was that a eureka? or a GLAD THAT $#!T IS OVER NEXT!!!!"\n\nGraphics are meh, gameplay may last awhile if you dont' cheat... and its cheap...

Without a narrative these puzzles are presented in a dry uninteresting slog.\n\nMany of these puzzles are presented without proper instructions on what the goal is or how to move the pieces.  Additionally many puzzle designs used are created to put the first player at a disadvantage and rely on luck of the AI making a mistake in order to win.","May 20","false","2.1"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"
