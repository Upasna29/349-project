Good modern warfare RTTs like World in Conflict/ Wargame only happen every few years so if you like those games check this out.\n\nA good compromise between realism and fun. Unit promotion system and basic economy system to reward keeping units alive for multiple mission. Pre / Post mission unit management similar to a very simplified Theatre of War interface but without the frusturating soldier by soldier search through a platoon for a good gunner or driver.\n\nGraphics on par with Command and Conquer Generals, which was good for the time. A lot more unit and ammo options for individual units but that is to be expected in a good Tatical Game. Unit salvage a good element that adds to the gameplay. Soundtrack good for the budget as well.\n\nI have heard Nvidia graphics users have had problems but this game is old enough to run fine on the CPU graphics amd and intel have.\n\nReal shame there is no demo for this game as most would be understandably reluctant to retail purchase a game from an unknown franchsise and developer that was under the radar from the day it was released. I might humbly suggest a certain bundle website.","December 7, 2013","true","0.5"," 41 of 48 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","41","48","0","0"

The government is in a state of collapse and turmoil and you have been chosen to lead the United States' armed forces to restore control.\n\nSearch and destroy using the latest military hardware from the Abrams tank to the Apache helicopter in realistic settings ranging from the open desert to close-quarters infantry combat. Wear down enemy morale by capturing vehicles, weapons and buildings. You'll need elite forces to destroy the world's best-armed fanatics, bent on world-wide economic collapse.
