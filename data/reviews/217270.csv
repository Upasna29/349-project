"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sysg3n/recommended/217270/","Sysg3n","Sysgen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sysg3n/","4616 products in account","From the creator of Prince of Persia, a fighter remade from early days of computing, 1984. Objective is to rescue the princess held captive by the evil warlord. You get three fighters though the ultimate objective is to not have to use numbers 2 and 3. The first fighter is weak and that's where the challenge lies. Upon his failure he is replaced by a stronger fighter. Upon his death he is replaced by an even stronger fighter. The princess is happy to be freed but wants her true love, fighter 1 to rescue her.\n\nUnlike the 1984 version this version is based almost solely on counters. By listening carefully to the musical score you can discern the number of attacks to which you must block. After successfully blocking the last attack you can counter, damaging the opponent and whittling away his health. There is a chi system that allows you to stun your opponent as well as a health recovery system after some but not all fights.\n\nThe game itself is quite short but the path to freeing the princess is challenging and the ambiance of feudal Japan is immersive. The game is also available on the IPhone but does support 1080P and controllers on the PC.","February 17, 2014","true","0.8"," 26 of 34 people (76%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","76","26","34","0","2"

And so there’s a fine line to ride between recreating outdated mechanics and deviating so heavily that the result bears little resemblance to its forbearer.\n\nKarateka, and complete remake of the Apple II game of the same name, falls on the side of defiantly indulging in a wholesale recreation of its former self. The visuals may be drastically improved by way of a slick (if somewhat washed out) cell shaded look, but the core of the same is still the same rhythm based fighter it always was, and therein lies the problem.\n\nI don’t think Karateka is bad, it’s just entirely as one-note as the now three decade old original, and wears out its welcome just as quickly as you’d expect. Though it resembles a fighting game, Karateka is far closer to a rhythm game. Attacking and blocking relies on proper timing and attention to visual cues, but there’s little player agency beyond reacting to the Simon-says feedback the game is giving you.\n\nThe idea is actually one I find pretty neat as a fan of rhythm games, and I was enjoying Karateka for at least the first handful of fights. But nothing ever changes beyond the simple fights your put through to learn how to play, and even at less than an hour long I was ready for Karateka to hurry up and end before it was even halfway through.\n\nThe repetition is grating and the game’s refusal to acknowledge and react to it frustrating. It’s not a game without merit, it just doesn’t know what to do with itself. That it’s constructed around a groan worthy damsel-in-distress plot, which culminates in the woman you’re rescuing effectively becoming your own prisoner, is only more bothersome and shows a hesitancy for Karateka to move past its archaic beginning. I’m not exactly sure who this version of Karateka is for, but as someone without any amount of nostalgia for the first it clearly wasn’t me.\n\nYou can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].","March 11, 2015","false","0.7"," 20 of 25 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","20","25","0","0"

This whole game is that for 30 minutes. There is a little tune before the enemy attacks indicating what rythem you have to block in but annoyingly enemies either have delayed attacks or sometimes they just don't put them in at all. One nice gimmick is that when you lose you get thrown off a cliff and a new (slightly uglier) hero comes along to try and save the shallow mute Princess. However as the final boss is always the only one to take you out, it leaves little motive to discover the alternative endings.

You get to use all three characters, one at a time, to beat the game. When one dies, the next one steps in to take his place right at the same spot. Health is sprinkled pretty generously throughout the game in the form of flowers. And even if you do die on the third character, you'll get a chance to exchange some of your points for an extra life with the last hero. Obviously, "mastery" of the game means beating it with fewer of the characters as miss foxypants prefers the second hero to the third, and the first hero to the second.\n\nGameplay is very simple. Run forward (there's no sideways movement, just forward) until you get to the next guard. When you fight the guard, listen for an audio cue that tells you the rhythm to block incoming attacks with, then counter attack as you wish. You occasionally fill your combo meter, which allows you to deal a not-all-that-special special attack.\n\nIf you want a quick game to kick out of your backlog, Karateka is a fine choice. It's totally a one-sitting game as you can beat it in half an hour. For that brief period of time, it's fun enough, and every time you think you've gotten it down, it throws a new tricky pattern at you, though it never gets too hard.\n\n3/5 Leprechauns in Space","March 3, 2014","true","0.6"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","11","14","0","0"

Sometimes you need to press it two or three times.  Then you press one of two attack keys (which one doesn't really matter) a few times.

The game doesn't even let you attack until after you've blocked first.  You cannot move your character.  There's no strategy, no combos, no variation; just block, block, attack, attack, attack.  It's like Punch-Out, but without the dodging, stamina, unique enemy attacks, or any of the other things that made Punch-Out fun.\n\nAfter doing the same thing a dozen or so times, I stopped playing.

That said, I have no basis for comparison to the original. It would seem some fans of the original did not like this remake too well. But this could very well be the same syndrome one gets when comparing a book to a movie adaptation, or anything similar.\n\nIn any case, I enjoyed the little bit I played of this. Karateka is very nice looking. You play as one of 3 characters: The hero of the game. A monk. And a oafish brute. You start as the hero, and when you die, the monk takes his place, and if the monk dies, the big brute takes his place. Each character has their own ending, and fighting style. So the objective to get the better endings would indeed be to not get killed.\n\nKarateka feels very on rails. It is 2.5D, and you can only move forward. there is no jumping, or going back. Just a series of fights. One after another. That is pretty much what this game involves. The fights though are handled pretty nicely. It's not like a fighting game, but more like a QTE without the on screen button prompts, or a rhythm game, again, without any prompts. You block oncoming attacks, which wll be switched up with each opponent, and after succesfully blocking, do your own attacks. Or once in a while, the enemy may taunt you, in which you can attack them at that point. That's pretty much it. Very simple, but challenging at the same time.\n\nThere is no voice work. There are no subtitles. So the story is pretty much interpreted through actions. But it's pretty simple. A young girl is being held captive. And one of the three playable characters is going to go through an army of bad guys to save her. One ♥♥♥ kicking at a time.\n\n\nI can't really recommend this one at the current price, given how short it is. But if you get a copy either through a bundle, or a nice discount, this is definitely worth playing.","April 12, 2014","true","0.7"," 13 of 18 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","13","18","0","0"

This title has a very classic approach to gamedesign, a simple base concept that you can understand in mere seconds but it's mastery will take several hours and quite a bit of dedication on your part.\n\nGameplay is for the most part a reaction test or should I say a test of patience? You observe the movement of the enemy, while listening to a few notes to tell you how many attacks to expect and then block the entire attack-string, opening up the enemy for a counter attack in the process.\n\nIt starts off easy, and feels quite a bit like "just a succession of Quicktime Events" in the beginning - but as you advance and enemies get harder and start messing with your timing by using delayed attacks or attacking in certain patterns that you best avoid using your Chi-attack - you will realize this game is deeper than it seems at first glance.\n\nThat realization is the moment when you start building a love/hate-relationship with Karateka, getting the game done with the first two suitors is rather easy - the true test of skill lies in getting the "true love" to the end. As you will mess up the first times around. And it takes insane amounts of concetration to get to the end unhurt and fully mastering the game. The rather short length of the title is a direct result of this, as it can get really intense if not frustrating to take on the final challenges this game offers - it will test your perseverance as it keeps throwing you back to square one time and time again.\n\nThis might be incredibly boring for some, since you go down the exact same path everytime and the only real progress you make is in learning pattern-timings for blocking, perfecting the battles as you go - reaching a zen-like state in the process.\n\nAt first I wasn't actually motivated enough to see it through to the "perfect" ending myself, getting through the game without making a single mistake is doable but not exactly a very enjoyable experience - overall I was not invested enough in the design of the world. Knowing the old game I am just not feeling the new approach in the art direction with rather cartoonish proportions especially on the main heroes and quite the boring looking goons you have to dispose. Somehow, I still kept going back to it - which means it had to do something right.\n\nAlso, the game trying to run at a steady 35 frames, and smoothing these frames to something between 22 and 62 on the fly depending on your rig is quite bad for a game that is this timing-dependent. And the perspective used in battles, while looking dramatic and all, isn't exactly helpful at showing you when certain attacks connect since bodyparts will be obscured by other bodyparts further killing my willingness to actively pursue achieving perfection in this game.\n\nLet me finish this by saying I was positively surprised by Karateka, offering more than I expected in terms of motivation and depth. If you can wrap your head around the idea of "learning" a game, chances are you will enjoy this as well.","December 1, 2013","true","6.3"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","0"

At the beginning I thought that the fact that you can only move forward to be a little strange and annoying but, once you understand the point of the game it really doesn't make any difference. There is no point on going back. I've played it a few times after getting to the end to see if I could beat the game without losing any life. When you die you come back to the game as a different character that is less desirable by the princess that you are attempting to safe. This makes you wanting to get to the end of the game without losing any life even more.

It's a fun idea, unless you want to listen to some background music of course. You start off with the True Love. The idea is to finish the game with this character in order to get the true ending. If this character is defeated in battle, he'll be replaced by a new characters which also gives you a different ending. It's unlikely you'll finish your first game with the first character, because the battles increase in difficulty near the middle of the game, which is about 15 minutes in. That's right. The game only lasts 30 minutes per session.\n\nThe graphics are cartoony and look pretty good in motion. The movies, however, look, and probably are, compressed. The sounds are nothing to write home about, but they get the job done.\nWould I recommend it ? In a way, yes, because the character idea is fresh and it's fun while it lasts. But the current price is just to steep if you ask me, especially for a game this short (even though it requires multiple playthroughs). Wait for a pricedrop; then get it.\n\n[Rating: 77/100]","December 15, 2012","true","1.8"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

I'm not really sure why it needed to be made, because seeing such an old game done up in such a fancy way is really a reminder of how far things have come. Playing the original as it was has nostalgia value, and this sort of does too, in a weird way. It's familiar but not at the same time. I think I have better feelings toward it having gotten it as part of a bundle than I would if I'd paid full price for it, as much as I like the people involved in making it.

Before playing I read all the bad reviews and thought I stumbled on a failure, but it was actually the good old fashion hate-behind-the-fanboyism... and yes there is a major fanboyism (I'm part of) that is dedicated to the classic 8-bit Karateka computer version from the 80's.\n\nSo after reading I thought I bought another lemon, but now I'm pretty much addicted to this version. In all honesty I would have done things differently if I was the main developer, however I'm still very pleased with this game. There needs to be an upgrade to the KEY BINDINGS for crying out loud.\n\nThis remake, does need a remake though. I do find it much easier then the orginal but still fun.

My memories of the original version from Broderbund, at a time when the Apple II was the cutting edge of personal computing technology, are hazy at best. I remember it not looking even as sophisticated as some of the beat-'em-ups of the day like Bruce Lee or Kung Fu Master, but I remember virtually nothing about the gameplay. The new Kareteka utilizes a peculiar, rhythm-based combat scheme that is easy to learn and difficult to--well, it's just difficult.\n\nYou play as one of three would-be rescuers attempting to save your beloved Mariko from the "evil warlord Akuma." You move through several environments doing battle with Akuma's minions with the ultimate goal of reaching his palace and the final battle. Mind you, you're not choosing which protagonist to play the game with; you start with Mariko's true love. If his health pool drops to zero, he falls to his death, and the monk takes his place. Should the monk perish, the brute takes his place. Finally, if the brute is beaten down, you have the option to continue, losing a certain percentage of your score in the process. Each successive hero has a larger health pool and stronger attacks. When grappling with a new opponent, your objective is to counter each punch or kick in a sequence by pressing the "block" button at just the right time. Even if you miss one or two and get hit, as long as you block the antagonist's last attack in that sequence, you are given the opportunity to launch a flurry of your own blows. After a series of 3-4 attacks, your opponent will become invincible again until you block another sequence of attacks. This dance continues until one of you is defeated. There are also purple flowers that you will encounter along the way that will partially or fully restore your health pool. Opponents gradually increase in difficulty by varying their attack patterns.\n\nIt sounds clever and fun on paper but in practice, the controls (even with an XBOX 360 controller) are wonky and your blocks don't always appear to register correctly. Even though you can easily run through the roster of opponents in less than an hour, I suspect even the most gifted Guitar Hero player will find himself unable to succeed in completing the game with Mariko's true love. The artwork looks good and the music is thematically-appropriate, but the gameplay itself leaves something to be desired. Kareteka makes for a brief but rather frustrating distraction from more complex games.","February 24, 2015","false","1.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
