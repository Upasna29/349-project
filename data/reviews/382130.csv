There was a major bug at release and I lost the first 6 hours or so of play and had to start over. I knew what to do then and repeated that 6 hours worth in like 2 hours. That 4:27 apparently doesn't count loading a saved game either (which I didn't have to do very often). Steam shows 12.7 hours total. I'm guessing it would take a new player about 6-8 hours.\n\nThe graphics, sound and music are all fine. Nothing sepectacular, but adequate and even fairly good for the most part.\n\nThe game has a few flaws, but I found it quite fun and worth the asking price.\n\nMy biggest problems with the game were:\n\n1) The beginning area (forest) is not really very fun. You start with nothing and you take fall damage. It is very easy to die by stepping off the wrong ledge. They did add a way to look down (hold "down" for a few secs) so this part should be a little better now.\n\n2) Most of the bosses are too easy. At least two of them have a "safe spot" where you can stand with almost no danger and kill them with your infinite ammo default handgun.\n\nAs to whether it's a a Metroidvania or not, I would say "yes". At first it feels a little more like "Out of This World", but as you progress and start finding power-ups and new weapons, it defintely starts feeling more like a Metroidvania.\n\nWhen you die, you restart on the screen you are on, from an auto-save so your hp, ammo, etc. are all restored to when you first entered the screen. There are no checkpoints and you can save anywhere. When you re-enter a screen, all the enemies have respawned, making it easy to farm hp or ammo.\n\nI wish there was a hard mode.\n\nEdit: I also should point out that at the end of the game I got a message saying I had found only 46.7% of the items, so there was a lot more exploring and discovery that could have been  done.","September 3, 2015","true","12.7"," 17 of 18 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","17","18","0","0"

In the end it is more or less the same game / experience as Inescapable.\n\nStranded on a remote planet, you quickly realize that something has gone very wrong and in order to survive you begin exploring. The game itself, just like Inescapable, seems mostly comparable to homecomputer-games that featured large, interconnected mazes with pretty basic combat - if you are thinking Shadow of the Beast or Flashback, you are not too far off. There is a bit of Metroid in here too, but the game's focus lies more in presenting the story and the nicely mythical atmosphere rather than secret rooms, item upgrades or complex movements to shortcut and sequence break sections.\n\nEspecially combat feels very "8-bit" and simplistic (jump and shoot) and a lot of the rooms are very basic and empty corridors - putting more emphasis on the whole "exploring old and forgotten ruins"-deal rather than being exciting and action-focused. The world is seemingly bigger than Inescapable (and if there ever was an item that allowed you to display a map, I never got it which made navigating a lot of the rooms that look quite samey somewhat irritating).\n\nEspecially towards the end when you have access to many different places but often times lack some sort of direction of where to go. Good luck finding that one corridor you need to go to when you are on an entirely wrong end of the map and do not even know what you are looking for. Inescapable was more compact and thus I never got as lost in it as in Exile's End which had me running in circles for a quite some time every now and then during my playthrough. Not explaining a lot of things didn't help either - remember that Powerbomb-moment in the glass tube in Super Metroid? Exile's End got quite a few of those - and these were tough not necessarily because I am dumb, but because the game isn't quite clear about the purpose of certain items nor does it really tell you that you are doing good / are on the right track. If you are into NES-style cryptic stuff, you might enjoy that - I am a bit on the fence here, the game doesn't have to exactly tell you things - but it could show stuff or inspire certain ideas through gameplay. Which it doesn't.\n\nWhen you got the right idea and things work out, the game is really engaging though. The atmosphere in particular is noteworthy, thanks largely to great pixelart, well done but brief cutscenes (think Ninja Gaiden) and an amazing soundtrack and sounddesign. The music is great, managing to evoke both feelings of fear and wonder and so is the sound design. understated but strangely fitting the style and adding to the "isolation"-aspect the game got going.\n\nIf you adored Inescapable and wouldn't mind an expanded version of that game - there is no doubt that you will enjoy this game. And I do recommend Exile's End in general, but I would add that the game is not without flaws (mainly, lack of direction and no failsafes if the player gets stuck/lost - and perhaps lacking in the combat- and leveldesign-aspect if you are expecting something more 16-Bit or even modern day quality) and would mostly be for people enjoying strong atmosphere and a nice scifi-short story rather than stellar gameplay.","September 13, 2015","true","6.9"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","11","11","0","2"

People are complaining because it doesn't play like Metroid or Castlevania, well boo hoo! The controls are really basic, only a few commands. It took me about ten minutes to figure out how to shift the screen by holding down, but I never played old computer classics before, so it made it a bit interesting. You get power-ups as you progress, just be sure to read the discription when you grab it, or you'll be scratching your head wondering what it was since it doesn't discribe the item again. The game is pretty short, took me about 3 1/2 hours to beat, but if your looking for something that is different or like 2d side scrollers, pick it up.","September 2, 2015","true","10.6"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","11","12","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cognitiveagent/recommended/382130/","cognitiveagent","PariahDog","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cognitiveagent/","776 products in account","ThemeExile's End has fantastic environmental graphics for a 2D platformer, making me think of the old Flashback game. Unlike Flashback, however, the environment looks very empty and bland. It is a shame that such beautiful graphics are paired with such lackluster level design. The soundtrack is nothing special, and even becomes very repetitive and droning after a while. The story is very simple as well - the protagonist is part of a rescue mission right when something goes horribly wrong. With no way out, the only thing left to do is to go further in and find out what is going on. Storywise, there is no real drive to continue playing the game. It is not very exciting and it all seems rather predictable.\n\nGameplayThe controls of the game are great, which is the most important aspect of a 2D platformer. However, the mechanics and level design are outright mediocre. Due to getting falling damage at the beginning of the game, you are pushed to explore your environments carefully before advancing. However, moving the screen around to do this is terribly slow and takes away from the platforming. The environmental dangers such as floor and ceiling spikes feel terribly cheap as you just can't be bothered to wait for your screen to move up or down.\n\nEnemy design is mostly lackluster. Each area usually has one or two enemy types that do little else but walk back and forth at the same pace. They feel out of place and offer no challenge what so ever, making them feel like filler content. The only exception is the first "tough" dog-like enemy you encounter, which sprints and jumps at you and requires a trick to escape from. The rest are just badly designed. Touching an enemy bumps you back a bit, but you get no invulnerability frames. Thus, if you are stuck in a corner or walking forward, you keep getting more and more damage.\n\nThe level design makes most screens feel like filler content (with monsters feeling like pointless bullet sponges), and often enemies spawn right in front of you when you transition from one screen to the next.\n\nExile's End allows you to save in any screen, but it's rather stingy when it comes to healing items. The only way to heal are from the limited number of health packs, and the rare pill drop from enemies. As a result, if you are low on health you'll find yourself grinding for such a pill drop. Fortunately, the game - outside of bosses - is not challenging at all. The majority of the damage you will get is from not being careful enough with the environment as you try to traverse filler content areas as fast as possible, desperately waiting for something exciting to happen.\n\nConclusionThe game would be great if enemies were more interactive and varied and the level design would do the graphical design justice. It's a real shame that the level design is so bad, because it is the one flaw making me not recommend this game. As it is, the game is bland and boring because of it.","September 16, 2015","false","1.9"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","2"

It wasnt a bad game it just didnt feel complete.\n\nLets start with the story, There is little of it. A few cutscences and some message logs , The latter mainly hidden in secret areas which makes me wonder if we were supposed to know what was going on. The main character may as well have been a sack of used socks as he has no story or information. It mentions a dishonorable discharge at the beginning, But thats all you ever learn about him. The other character that helps you may as well be wearing the same sack, as even less info was given out about him. The end has you make a choice without telling you that it is one, I ran forward and got one of the endings on accident and was left wondering "Do I care?" I had formed no attachment to my alloted sack of socks which caused the end choice to be a pointless one.\n\n\nUp next is combat. It takes a while to get your first actual weapon until you do you are stuck with rocks which i thought was funny, The weapons themselves were well designed except the grenade launcher which for some reason if you hit an enemy on the top of its sprite, It would do the same damage as a rock or less. The placed explosives which I found no use for other than blowing up a clay pot i had put on a plate I shouldnt have and the cloaking device which lasted about a second and did about as much as covering youself in a sheet and yelling "im not here! You cant see me!"\n\nEnemies! Largely boring. There are two kinds walkers and flyers. The walkers tend to walk straight at you and fire their respective weapons (Gun/fireball) Except the spiders which alternate between floor and ceiling, The chargers which rush you and explode when killed and the stalkers which turn invisible. And flyers do just that, Fly. Didnt matter the sprite they all did the same thing. There is a unique enemy that runs quite fast, kills very fast and is attracted to sound but ultimatly nothing was done with it. Wasted potential as it would've been quite cool if it stalked you through the game, Kinda like a SA-X.\n\nBosses! Where there any? Only one truly felt like a boss, even had a cutscene beforehand but nothing happens when you win, he drops a weapon and leaves you to your own devices. The cutscene had him holding a bag standing in front of a giant crystaline figure. Okay, Whats in the back pack? Where did it go? Whats with the figure? When I won I worried that the game might have glitched because no acknowledgement was made at all that I had just defeated a boss. No acknowledgement was made of the back pack or the figure which the man was obsessed with. So yea, The boss fights were uninspiring.\n\nAudio/Graphics! I play most games with music off so i cant really comment on that. The small parts of music i did hear sounded alright however. Graphics are probably the best thing about this game. I enjoyed them immensely, It felt like i had loaded this game through windows 3.1 with a backup floppy disk in case i didnt have enough memory. Good times.\n\nOverall the game was boring, Its got a lot of space but its wasted and sparsely filled with anything of interest. There are two things however that I truly hated. The first was the map, I like to fill in my maps and in some rooms it seemed quite impossible as the missing pieces where high in the air or embedded in the walls. It was very annoying.\n\nSecond was the lack of any invincibility frames anywhere. If one of the walkers traps you in a corner you will keep taking damage until you die, and because your character reacts to every hit, escape is very difficult.\n\nMy overall completion was 84% and I was bored for the majority of it. Im sorry but I wouldnt recommend this game to my friends but I would recommend it to people I dont like.","September 25, 2015","false","6.5"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

I'm including the first video of my Let's Play here for visuals, as I think the start of the game does a great job of setting the tone.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nak8niRWUmo\nWhile the developer states 'NOT a Metroidvania', I have to humbly disagree.  However, it is also very reminiscent of games like Flashback in its style, presentation, and puzzle-solving.  Where it deviates greatly from Flashback are in the controls, which are tight and responsive.\n\nExile's End follows the journey of old soldier Jameson upon his team crash-landing on a foreign planet, one actively preventing him from escaping.   Story elements are told through communication with your ship's AI, through computer entries found in the environment, and through beautifully drawn cutscenes.  All to the sounds of a great retro-sounding, yet atmospheric, soundtrack.\n\nYou start off the game entirely defenseless, to the point where even falling more than a few feet will cause significant damage or certain doom.  Much like Flashback, a simple rock becomes an important tool for the beginning of the game.  As you progress your suit is upgraded to handle more and more dangerous environments along with an ultimately impressive array of weapons, tools, and items.\n\nMuch like Metroid, as you acquire new suit upgrades, new areas will become open to you.  While you can follow a somewhat linear path through the game, there's a ton of hidden items and secrets to be found if you take the time to explore.  In fact, during my playthrough I only found 56% of the items (according to the endgame screen) and I thought I had been fairly thorough!\n\nExile's End does a solid job of presenting the player with puzzles and challenges that require you to think a little more.  The design feels, again, very similar to Flashback in that the solution to puzzles is not always immediately obvious but generally requires manipulation of the environment through whatever tools you have available.  This could be as simple as throwing something to hit a switch, or triggering a sequence of events to open a door.  While some of the solutions can be a bit obtuse, it's clever for the most part and one of the game's strong points.\n\nIt should be noted that Exile's End isn't a particularly long game, especially if you're not hunting for all of the secrets and items.  My final playtime on Steam for my first playthrough was 5.3 hours, with an in-game time clocked at 4:10.  I died / loaded saves a number of times, so that's where the discrepancy comes in.\n\nAll told, I like it quite a bit.  It's not a perfect game, but it had me hooked.  The majority of my playtime game within a single session; I always wanted to see what was beyond that next door, solve that next puzzle, see the next piece of the story.","September 6, 2015","true","9.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198006276098/recommended/382130/","76561198006276098","Mickey The Dole Scum","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198006276098/","193 products in account","A pretty cool mix of Flashback with heavy leanings towards Metroid best describe the feel of this game. The music score is quite simply phenomenal. Composed by Keiji Yamagishi himself, of "Ninja Gaiden" fame. The Royal Bath melody in particular I never grow tired of hearing. Enough can't be said about having really good background music to set the mood and accompany you while traversing around the depths of the planet.\n\nMost would agree that controls are very important in a game like this. Thankfully you'll come to find the controls are very solid, tight, and responsive. Far to many indie games drop the ball when it comes to controls, but Exile's End certainly got it oh so right.\n\nThe plot itself is rather typical sci-fi fair with some interesting undertones. A lone survivor of a spaceship wreck, finds himself stranded on an alien planet. You'll find yourself surrounded by a hostile environment, trying to figure your escape, while unraveling this foreign worlds mysteries without giving away to much.\n\nLevel design is very well done indeed. I really have to commend the developers when it comes to this particular area. So many little touches all come together to pull off a well crafted game. For example, generally when you're forced to back track (in order to use a key item you just discovered in a previous area) you're usually given a handy short cut nearby to use. Back tracking is kept to a minimum as much as possible. Unlike some of the lesser enjoyable games of this style; Exile's End doesn't make the mistake of purposely using backtracking as a tool to pad the game in order to make it seem longer. It also features a helpful mapping guide very much like Super Metroid's, which fills in new areas as you explore them.\n\nThe puzzles you encounter are fairly easy to solve. If not a little vague at times. Which encourages some old fashion problem solving skills. The solutions always make sense. It is nice that the game doesn't give you to many hints, or constantly try to hold your hand at every step of the way. In this way it stays true to it's retro roots.\n\nGraphically it's very much up to par with some of the top SNES games of the golden era. The animated cut scenes look fantastic. Each of the area's has it's own unique look and theme which differentiates itself from the last in distinct ways. Keeping the game fresh each time you move into a new zone. Bosses, enemy monsters and other characters fit the unearthly forms that you would expect.\n\nDifficulty is only moderate in normal story mode. The game allows for saves and also autosaves at the start of every screen you enter. This make it's pretty forgiving. Trying to find all of the items and secrets can be the most difficult part. I never found myself stuck for very long or felt any part of the game was unfair and overly frustrating. People looking for more a real challenge have Survival Mode avaliable.\n\nHad this game been released on a 16 or 32-bit console of the day, I think the magazines of the time would have probably rated it atleast an overall 8.5 out of 10. It doesn't really do anything new, but what it does do well is bringing together elements from many classic games. Blending them into a different perspective with top quality gameplay.\n\nVery high quality indie game that deserves a chance. If you've been searching for a game that can stand up to some of the best that 90's classic console gaming had to offer look no further than Exile's End!","November 27, 2015","true","23.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","2"

If I swing back through a few months later and there's no progress then I'm going to switch my vote.\n\nThis is a story-driven metroidvania. The art and music is great and the controls are decent, but there are just so, so, so many completely bizzarre design deicsions that I just don't really want to play it anymore until there's an update. There are a lot of things that just seem like a blatant "screw you" to the player. The rocks and worms, for example. A weapon that's a complete pain in the ♥♥♥ to aim and a ubiquitous enemy that's nearly impossible to target without it. Then there's just plain ♥♥♥♥ moves like putting a worm in a narrow passage with spikes on top so you can't jump over it. The only way past without taking damage is to throw a rock a split second after entering the room. Otherwise the worm is too close and you can't hit it anymore. You'd think that a guy with a nifty power suit would be able to do nifty things like aim down slightly to kill the most common enemy in the game, but apparently that capability is not in the suit schematics. That's okay, though, because when you encounter shooting enemies they can't aim down either, so you can win gunfights against impossible odds by crouching and then just shooting until they're all dead.\n\nI'm not really sure what the design goals were, but someone has a very unusual idea about what fun is.\n","November 23, 2015","true","4.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If all you need is a quick fix of metroidvania, this isn't terrible, but it's very barebones in the end.\n\nExploration is not much about using abilities and exploring as much as throwing grenades at everything.\n\nIt's not bad, just... lackluster.","December 31, 2015","false","3.4"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

I really wanted to love this game.  Too bad the controls arent quite up to par and the game is beyond frustrating.  SO many unavoidable deaths.  Also it's not a metroidvania.","September 2, 2015","false","504.8"," 5 of 25 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","5","25","0","3"

On that note, a menu showing what abilities you've aquired would be nice ala super metroid, and support for the mouse would be wonderful, also tweaking the map so it filled in those akward area's would be great. Other than that definitly worth the buy.","September 3, 2015","true","7.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

IT HAS NO F*****G QUEST INDICATOR. So you spend 5/7 of playtime just going to and fro every corner of the map searching how to use the last item you got..... It really frustrating.\n\nFurthermore, I happen to have skipped the cutescene were they tell you what you'Re doing in the game, so now, I have not a single clue.","January 11","false","3.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you grew up on games like this then this game is really satisfying at first.\n\nDue to that, I enjoyed going through it once.  I am not sure if a person without said experience would.   It essentially has NO replay value in my mind.  The level design is horribly boring and the gameplay is not very challenging.\n\nOverall, I give it a recommend because the look and sound of it is so beautiful and it was intriguing enough that I played it all the way through.","January 24","true","6.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
