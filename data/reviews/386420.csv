You control it over arrow keys, x=hat attack and z=jump. The game is clearly just a flashgame. So I got it in a bundle for cheap. Wouldn't buy for it more than 1 EUR.

Don't mind this review if you're intrested in gameplay-releated review, as it's okay.\n\nBut I'm not willing to rate this game positive. Hit detection is indeedwonky  - I've got killed by shots what was going above my hat, while I killed zombie-dogs (?) who was basically *inside* me and still survived.\nBut my main gripe is game design. Level design is okay, most levels can be easily completed within the time limit - but game design.\n-There's no way to exit the game unless you start a game - no escape option in menu, and neither escape button works.\n-The game's controls are simple (4 directons+jump+hit) but one can not rebind the buttons. And while X-Y is a common pick for the old A B buttons, my qwertz keyboard begs to differ that this is the best available option. Yes, I know I can change it to english with shift-alt as I've done it, but still - non-rebindable controls should be forbidden in 2015.","February 5","false","3.8"," 13 of 21 people (62%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","62","13","21","0","2"

This is a lot easier, though, since you've got offensive capabilities with your hat.  You can use it to kill enemies, or to reflect shots back.  It's nice looking, and it's got really cheery music.  The only gripe is that it's pretty short, so unless you're planning on perfecting your runs, it's probably only going to last you under an hour.

Of course the is some platforming, fighting and some puzzle to make your journey challenging. There is also a time limit to finish each normal and boss level. Hopefully Job is resourceful : he can use his hat to knock out foes and can also reflects with it fire balls. Job is not alone, several big ears Leprechauns, plants and cows will help him through his journey. Finally you begin the game with 3 lives and can acquire several more in some challenging area or in some trees.\n\nYou can always quit the game and resume where you left it but beware to not press enter before choosing Continue instead of the default choice of New game. The game isn't too long, less than an hour is enough to beat the game.\n\n(#):\nOne achievement is earned after finishing the game (easy difficulty) and another one is earned after finishing the game without using a continue (medium difficulty). At the beginning I didn't really got it, but after finishing the game I can confirm that a continue is granted when you have lost all your lives. So it's really easy to finish the game.\n\n(*):\nEven it's still difficult for you to finish the game without using any continue you can save some lives by escaping the game before your life is taken and resume the game. But this is mostly doable when you fell off the screen or running out of time and hard to make in the other cases.","April 12","true","1.4"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","5","6","2","0"

The music, however limited in variety was catchy enough to listen to; chip tunes were a befitting choice for this retro title.\n\nWhen it comes down to the game play, you can anticipate 31 levels spread across two worlds, where you have to control the Leprechaun to collect all four leaf clovers while avoiding the witch’s mooks. There are also 2 boss battles that was a bit underwhelming in difficulty, along with 1 bonus level where you control the cow in a quick sprint for clovers.\n\nIf you are familiar with this genre then you’ll probably find this game a breeze to play through, although one or two levels did have a rather odd difficulty spike. This won’t be a game that people will obsess over, but it will neatly occupy someone for an afternoon.","April 16","true","5.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It's difficult to jump and grab a ladder without being right under it. You will often slide off and fall if you try to run and jump to it. Moving platforms are easy to miss and fall to your death, even though it looks like you should have made it. Overall, the controls are tolerable, but could be better.\n\nThe biggest problem for me is that you have 3 continues (of 3 lives each) and then you have to start over. This means if you finish 25 levels then run out of continues, you get to do those 25 levels again. Both times I played it, I lost most of my lives on the same level (the fireball throwing birds...I keep running out of time.). I am currently not motivated to try again, but probably will at some point.\n\nThe levels are even labeled 1-1 through 1-x, 2-1 through 2-x, etc. I don't know why you can't continue from 2-1 if you get that far. This is pretty standard in these types of games.\n\nIt is fun for an hour or two, and pretty cheap, so give it a go if you don't mind starting over.\n\n","October 12, 2015","true","1.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"
