The "game" plays out like an indie short film with bizarre imagery and a pretensious "plot". The entire game consists of about 15 very simple puzzles mixed in with some nonsensicle cut scenes of raw meat in a sink. If Calendula's aim is to be creepy, it failed.

For a game that is mostly made of seemingly broken features and insane surreal glitches, it tells a fairly coherent and enjoyable story. Even if you're not in it for the story, it's still a supreme mind-screw. The puzzles are brain-tingling but solvable, and each time I solved one I felt like I'd done something incredibly wrong.\n\nNote the short playtime, but also know that the game is expertly paced and just the right length for the type of experience it delivers. If you want to feel truly bewildered and slightly uncomfortable, then this game is definitely for you. It never let me get my bearings, and it was over before I knew what happened.

I really do. I loved the game... but I cannot recommend it to people, especially at the current price tag it has. The game is good, it has great atmosphere to it and its all psychological in its presentation. I love games like that. The problem here... its too short. You can get through it all well within 30 to 40 minutes and thats the game. If the price drops... I do recommend a playthrough of it then. especially if it  was on sale for a dollar. That feels like a more acceptable price tag for a game that has no real replay value. No, i am not trying to bash the makers of this game. As i said before, I loved it and I love the concept of it, its just... -way- too short.

After solving one you get to walk a few meaningless steps in a meaningless corridor and see some really meaningless pictures, which are meant to be disturbing. There also are creepy sound effects all the time, which at least have a better impact than the rest. I guess you could say that the screenshots on the Steam shop page already spoiler you most of the game's content.\n\nI would've recommended CALENDULA if it was free. But I paid 6$ for this, which is far too much.

The well done visuals and effects got me interested, and then... what? The whole ending turns out to be the overdone "whole thing is a metaphor for death/rebirth" cliche? I was expecting to learn more about what was going on, to uncover some secret hidden in plain sight, have the information it wanted at the start to be used against me somehow, ANYTHING but that same cliche. The game did occasionally give some occasional good foreshadowing, but a big chunk of the disturbing imagery seems to have been put in there simply for the sake of being disturbing. I never really got invested in the game, I spent most of my playtime waiting to get to the good part.\n\nHowever... I don't really HATE this game. If I had, I probably wouldn't have even bothered to review it. I like the amazing potential it shows.

You must navigate through the start menus, trying to get to the "game" itself. There's always a puzzle you have to solve, usually by adjusting the settings in some way. Clues are provided via error messages. Every time you manage to load a file, you are treated to a straight walk through a hallway or something and then sent back to the start menu with a new puzzle. They are usually rather straightforward- I was able to solve every puzzle myself without consulting any guides. It took me about an hour to beat the game, so it's very short- It's probably not worth 7 dollars, at least in my opinion. But my main complaint lies elsewhere.\n\nThe store description says that this is a game that doesn't want to be played. I think that's a novel concept, and one that deserves fleshing out. I found myself extremely curious as to what it could mean. Is the game haunted, and trying to steer me away from my doom? Indeed, as I played it, I found myself thinking that this is how a 'haunted' video game might actually look- graphical glitchiness, cryptic menu text, and continuous restarting with subtle differences each time- no ridiculous creepypasta stuff like Mario or Sonic hyperealistically bleeding over all their friends or anything.\nI soon realized, however, that the devs weren't quite interested in pursuing this innovative path. As text throughout the game, the bizzare final "cutscene", and a couple threads in the steam discussions seemed to indicate, this game's primary purpose looks to be metaphorical.\nMetaphorical for a subject that has nothing to do with the game itself, and is a completely unnecessary sidetrack to what might have been an incredibly innovative horror game. The missed potential is depressing. I was expecting an experience focused on me, the player, but instead the game thrusts the role of a hypothetical person in an unrelated situation upon you. In a normal game, this is expected, but in a meta-game such as this one, it's unacceptable.\n\nI will still give Calendula a tentative recommendation (for a cheaper sale buy of course), since it still contains some innovative and fun puzzles. However, if this game had been designed with its store description's face value more in mind, I believe it could have been much better.","March 4","true","1.7"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","12","13","0","0"

But the game resists being played, actively evading the player with its constantly shifting commands.\n\nIt takes the broken menu puzzles of Pony Island and makes a complete experience of them. Thanks to the sheer originality of its execution, it's effective and engaging, and Calendula conjures up plenty of opressive tension through its disconcerting atmosphere.\n\nBetween puzzle sloving there are surreal first person vignettes which form the actual "game" of Calendula that we're trying to play. These sections add to the disturbing vibe rather than give any real exposition or narrative, until later when we're beat over the head with the obvious symbolism.\n\nUltimately it's up to the player to decide "what it all means", and I concluded with a story that works for me, although that narrative doesn't connect with the mechanics of the game in any meaningful way. They feel like seperate experiences.\n\nStill, it's a sharp and mysterious atmospheric-puzzler, even if it's intended mind-â¥â¥â¥â¥ doesn't quite come together with its mechanics in unity.","February 3","true","2.3"," 17 of 25 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","17","25","0","0"

I've never played a game quite like it, and find it impossible to compare it to anything else.\n\nSometimes, there are more to games than reaching clear goals or defeating obvious enemies.

In Calendula you are trying to play a game and load save files. Most of the save files are password protected and you must do a number of different tasks to work out each password whilst the self-aware game tries to screw with you.\n\nEvery time you manage to load a save file you walkthrough a small section of trippy horror game before being kicked back out to the main screen. The best way I can describe the visual style of this game is a computer game version of the video in the Ring. Put it this way I am going to be keeping an eye on any wet pale dark haired girls for the next few weeks.\n\nThe key difference to Pony island is the puzzles in Calendula are a little bit less like puzzles and more working things out by manipulating the menu screens and playing with the settings. While I can see a lot of people will find this game a lot more simplistic than Pony Island I actually found the more natural less contrived puzzles of this game more enjoyable than the more obvious puzzles of Pony Island.\n\nSo which one to play? Both games are good and well worth a play through and both are different enough to warrant some attention on their own merits. Both are cheap and neither outstay their welcome. If you must pick Pony Island is a little bit more of a puzzle game and Calendula is more of a detective game.\n\nBoth however are good fun that I would definitely recommend picking up if you fancy something a little bit different.\n\nPlease check out our comparison video below if you would like to know more...\n\nhttp://www.thegametutor.co.uk/videos/game-tutor-compares/160207_game-tutor-compares-pony-island-and-calendula\n\nA KEY FOR THE GAME WAS OBTAINED FROM THE DEVELOPER BUT MY VIEWS AND OPINIONS ARE 100% MY OWN.\n","February 6","true","2.6"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","6","8","0","0"

Since I must, I have to lean more towards wanting to enjoy the "game," but it simply wasn't for me.\n\nMany will point out the heavy borrowing from the Pony Island concept and they're not wrong, but it's not a reason alone to dislike Calendula. Yes there a many completely original games out there, and there have and always will be games that borrow concepts from those before it. It's not a big deal, because so many great games take these concepts and do something great with them. Sometimes it's a new twist. Sometimes it's an incredible story. There's a myriad of things you can do with a borrowed concept to elevate it. Calendula did so very little to try.\n\nThe atmosphere was fun and the puzzles were pretty decent. Other than that, it's incredibly short (50 minutes without much brain stuggle,) and it doesn't have much plot or heft to hold the package up.

Not because I did not enjoy it, I did, and I want more from these guys. It's just that it feels like there is more. It feels like some of those puzzles in original Assassin's Creed games, where you simply knew that there is more. The symbolism here is visible and understandable on 2nd playthrough, but it's like you are looking onto 1 spot, not on the bigger picture (bigger than you are). You feel that there is a bigger story. Bigger past and bigger future.

Or rather, I thought I was enjoying where it was going. Every time you complete a puzzle you get a small walking section (where you can only go straight, and the game turns you through glitches if necessary) followed by a brief fmv clip. I'm going to spoil the "twist" in this review, but honestly, its Shyamalan levels of dumb.\n\nAt the beginning of each level you are booted back to the main menu screen. That much you probably already know. The majority of gameplay takes place here. This is where the game is at its best. It's extremely fun to solve abstract puzzles that â¥â¥â¥â¥ with your perception of the menus, the space around them, and the ambient audio. It's all very interesting, and I absolutely love it during this, even if it is a tad too easy.\n\nOnce you solve the puzzle, you get a walking segment. The environments differ each time, but they're always fairly basic corridors. After the walking is where it gets juicy. At some point during the walk glitches will appear and the game will fade into an unsettling fmv clip that implies more is going on.\n\nThe game has a ton of eye imagery, some are photorealistic during the transition to fmv. One puzzle has you go into an ingame fake chat room where somebody screams at you to "please stop" and asks why you're doing "this", then repeating "WHY" repeatedly before he 'logs off'. At one point during a walking section you approach a globe, and it darkens as you approach, almost seeming to mold. The game seems to be about some large world government, cult, or Umbrella-style science gone wrong sort of story. It gets you hooked the moment you start considering the first few fmvs and only stacks evidence from there.\n\nWhat's the ending, I hear you ask? None of the above. You're a kid named Calendula being born. The ending is atrocious.\n\nI was honestly tempted to refund this game, but seeing as how I absolutely adored the puzzle section, I've decided to leave my money with Blooming Buds. I loved your game, but don't lead me on with a story. Next time you guys make a game, include a narrative that isn't a bunch of disconnected parts that can't be related to each other, okay? The ending is what REALLY brought this down.","February 6","false","1.0"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

The game is less 'meta' and more just plain glitchy. It's fun, and the puzzles are a great mixture between challenging, do-able, and unnerving, and the music in particular was very good, as were some of the visual elements (although not all of it- it runs on Unity, after all). But it is not horror. It's definitely creepy in parts, and if you have an aversion to glitching or technology with slight self-awareness then this may get you feeling a little panicked. What ruins it, however, is the storyline element, which is a little contrived, the allegory a little forced, and the ending less of a big spooky bang and more of a tired mumbling of "Oh, no. Not this again!"\n\nPlay it, definitely. It's a nice little indie game with a lot of atmosphere, which for the most part makes up for any downfalls.","February 2","true","2.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I got hung up in the eyeroom but Alt-F4ing and reopening it fixed it.\n\nOver all the concept was solid. I really enjoyed the game and its subtle unerving atmosphere. The puzzles were interesting but not hard which was a nice touch. I beat it in about two hours.\n\nMy main gripe is the plot which ends, in my opinion, in a way that feels way too cliche. I won't spoil it but, as your going through, if you've played other indie games out there, you're more than likely going to figure out how it ends pretty quickly.\n\n6-7/ 10  Is what I say. Great idea, concept, and excecution with pretty cool sound design to boot. The main problem being the story, which, unfortunatly in a game like this, seems a bit weak.","February 3","true","1.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Th game for itself combines several kind of artistic styles in an interresting way.\nAlso the subtle differences of the vein durinf the game-progress are great.\n\nAt least I can say that this game defines the art of horror in a complete new way.\n\nIt's quite a short game but worth the few bucks they demand.\n\n\nI highly suggest playing this game - especially after a hard working-day at the office!","May 21","true","5.1"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"

"game." So I decided to try this one out....and boy oh boy. This had made my brain from normal to mush and then finally into a boiled, liquidfied goop.\n\nIn all funny commenting aside, the purpose of this experience is this: One part is "fixing" the "game", and the other part is going through a slow, linear direction with slight creepy imagery at the end of some "stage" before going back to the menu. For there on, these "puzzles" get more, and more complex as you try to resolve this issue.\nThe plot of this "game" is something that got me thinking in my head on what is it all about....until I didn't expect the ending that had made my jaw drop in utter surprise, and my mind cringed.\n\nThis was so mysterious, intriguing, and freaky that the atmosphere is what I liked.\nThe most part I really LOVED that goes with the atmospheric themes in this "game" is the ambient music. It has a meaning of searching through a path to find. When I close my eyes, I imagine of doing it through my mind.\nThe only gripe I don't like is that I'm not the guy that plays games on full screen since I prefer using via small resolution window, and they don't exactly provide to what I want.\n\nDo I recommend this game?\nA slight yes...if you are interested on why this "game" is broken...for a purpose.\nI can't guarantee if you can handle what the meaning of this "game" is all about.","May 26","true","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It leans heavily on inspiration into the world of metaphysics, and you find yourself questioning whether Calendula is a malevolent or benevolent entitiy.  The puzzles were clever, and I enjoyed the unsettling atmosphere.  It will take you about 50 minutes to play through the entire thing, so I definitely wouldn't say it's worth $7, but it's a great experience.  The ending will have you thrown.  The entire point of the game is definitely unclear, and the "cutscenes" (points in the game in which you simply move forward through rooms) seem to be unconnected, but the atmosphere gives me shivers.\n\nLess of a game, more of an experience that you interact with.  However, that is definitely not a bad thing.","May 28","true","1.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/FPLOON/recommended/427810/","FPLOON","COMPUTEROSIS","http://steamcommunity.com/id/FPLOON/","70 products in account","Before I continue, I would like to point out that the time I spend on CALENDULA is not so much how long it took me to beat this "game", but a measurement to how many times I've beaten it overall... I would say the same for Pony Island, but that review was substituted for a guide instead... *sighs* And now, back the review already in progress...\n\n...CALENDULA, without giving too much away, can be broken up into two parts... There's the game that this "game" will constantly try to prevent you from playing and the "game" that's more meta than the game you're trying to play... It's like the difference between an abstract poem of a raven and an abstract poem from Charles Dickens about a raven where despite them both being open to interpretation by the reader, the Charles Dickens abstract poem is more limited because we already know who wrote that abstract poem if we read through it again...\n\nAnyway, as abstract as this "game" can get both inside and outside its puzzle-feeling "gameplay", if one does decide to dive into it, I suggest it should be done with an open enough mind to draw their own interpretations and/or conclusions rather than to prove (or disprove) someone else's interpretations and/or conclusions... This goes double for the "game" and not so much for the game, though, because CALENDULA has its own metaphorical path in comparison to the path (aka "game") that takes you to playing CALENDULA... However, one's milege may vary after one compete playthrough alone, so the experience [positive, negative, or otherwise] may or may not equate to the amount of money use to purchase the game CALENDULA, for example...\n\nPersonally, I would recommend it at either the price that one's willing to relinquish in order to play this game or as a wishlist recommendation to remind your [Steam] friends that this would make a potential recommended [Steam] gift to you when a certain future become the current present... I would also gladly buy this for a [Steam] friend if said game was on their wishlist, but I only have one friend before the posting of this review that makes this statement metaphorically foreshadowing until a certain future becomes the current present... Overall, just like Pony Island, it was an experience worth replaying more than once and I would gladly replay this game [again] in my future especially with headphones [again] for a greater experience in general...\n\nIf you have read this far into the review's end, then I can honestly see that it is not your fault curiosity has brought you here...","June 6","true","4.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
