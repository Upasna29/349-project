That one last good title they made before releasing the godawful Chronicles and Angel of Darkness.\n\nTomb Raider the Last Revelation takes place in one singular location rather than different parts of the world. While that might seem like a downside, the design team actually implemented it very well. The game gradually branches out and becomes heavily non-linear. With the player returning to prior maps to solve newly found puzzles. They also added a map editor, and since the 90s hundreds of maps have been published online\n\nAdd to that a great story that keeps your attention and genuinely challenging puzzles. Delight yourself to the Last Revelation, ultimately the last great Tomb Raider game.","September 12, 2013","true","10.9"," 49 of 51 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","49","51","0","4"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/synthsequence/recommended/224980/","synthsequence","synthsequence","http://steamcommunity.com/id/synthsequence/","442 products in account","If there's one thing I can say about The Last Revelation, it's that it surprised me greatly. I'd be lying if I said that my expectations weren't low for the fourth entry into the immortal Tomb Raider series. No Croft Manor? No Judith Gibbins as the voice actress for Lara? No inventory ring? No musical score by the awesome Nathan McCree? No locking Winston in the freezer? All these charming little things from the previous games that up and left with The Last Revelation had me thinking that I would be quite disappointed with Core Design's next foray into the adventures of Indiana Jane and the Breasts of Enormity. It's not often that I like being proven wrong, but I can happily say that The Last Revelation surpassed my expectations and proved why I can't keep myself away from this excellent series.\n\nWhile it is sad to see the previously mentioned elements missing from this installment, the gameplay itself is still the stellar, straight-forward and damn fun formula players have grown accustomed to in the last three games. Lara returns with all her previous manouvres, and a few new ones to boot, including rope-swinging, shimmying around corners and pole-climbing. Nothing groundbreaking, but hey, if it ain't broke, don't fix it. The Last Revelation has seemingly taken a few pages from Resident Evil's book. There's a largely increased emphasis on puzzles and riddles, some of which are quite complex. This is a well thought out departure from Tomb Raiders 1-3, in which pretty much every puzzle boiled down to "find keys to open this door so you can open that door to get that key to pull this switch". You can also now combine certain items and vision-based items such as binoculars and scopes are frequently used. Some weapons also have multiple ammo types which is a lovely added touch.\n\nThe Last Revelation is also the most accessible game in the series since the first. I loved the slow but steady learning curve of the original release, and I found it irritating that in the second and third games, Core went kind of ballistic with the difficulty, throwing all kinds of cheap deaths here and there and ruining the pace accordingly. The Last Revelation is quite easy compared to its predecessors, but thankfully the challenge once again builds up as you get used to controlling Lara once again. Later on in the game, you gain access to hub-like levels and backtracking between areas adding some welcome open-world and exploration elements. Fans may be disappointed with the reduced difficulty though, and I find this understandable. Secrets are a cinch to find, and there's so many items jam-packed into Lara's tiny backback, I'm surprised she can even stand up, let alone monkey swing, drop-hang onto a crevice, crawl, 180, backflip mid-air, catch a rope, swing back and forth, jump pistols akimbo slaying infernal bats, sprint and dive-roll inbetween rotating circular blades.\n\nThe game is also fantastically long. The earlier entires opted for a smaller amount of levels, but these levels were insanely large and sometimes overly complex. This time, due to their reduced size and the addition of backtracking, combined with the ever-changing environments leads to a far less boring and cumbersome experience.\n\nApart from the first two levels in Cambodia, which serve as a tutorial, the entire game takes place in Egypt. The Tomb Raider series is well known for its varied locations, with Lara often globetrotting to retrieve her beloved artifacts, but even with only one major set-piece, the game never gets boring. The choice to have a single primary location for the setting helps keep the game more cohesive, and it makes the plot flow together much easier. Yes, the story is still not Pulitzer Prize worthy, but it's entertaining and far more involving than the previous games. It's great to have an antagonist who has some sort of depth and character.\n\nPeter Connelly is no Nathan McCree, but he does a pretty swell job on the soundtrack. As long as we still have some form of the original theme, I'm content. Jonell Elliott also provides a great voice for Lara, although I did prefer her more mature tone that Judith Gibbins provided in previous installments. The Tomb Raider engine is showing its age at this point, but Core continues with its stellar level design and intelligent workarounds to ensure that levels remain unblocky, despite the engine's limitations. FMV sequences are heavily improved from past entires, but the animations are still kind of robotic.\n\nWhat else can I say? I was so pleasantly surprised with The Last Revelation, and I think you will be too. Tomb Raider 2 and 3 felt more like expansion packs, but The Last Revelation is truly the sequel to the original masterpiece. Core has basically perfected their formula at this point, and I can only hope that Tomb Raider: Chronicles follows suit. It's definitely the best since the original, and I would even go as far to say that it surpasses it.\n\n4.5/5","October 17, 2014","true","29.2"," 52 of 56 people (93%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","93","52","56","5","0"

After a tutorial with young Ms. Croft, we find Lara and a guide exploring the Tomb of Seth in Egypt, looking for the Amulet of Horus. The plot revolves around Egyptian Gods, Pyramids, ancient artifacts of power, and actual tomb raiding! The previous 2 sequels to TR1 WERE enjoyable but TR IV is the one that really gets back to its roots. This game is all about exploring Egypt's tombs and ruins. Lara visits the Temple of Karnak, the Tomb of Semerkhet, the Temple of Isis, and Cleopatra's Palaces - to name a few places. And don't think she's just raiding. The Last Revelation has a very interesting and intense story.\n\nControls: Same as TR 1-3\n\nGraphics: Definite improvement over 3\n\nMusic: All new Egyptian-themed music for IV\n\nDifferences from TR 1-3: There is a LOT to explore. Instead of completing an area and moving onto the next, you'll often have to revisit areas - moving back and forth to complete puzzles and solve Egypt's mysteries.\n\nI'm a huge Tomb Raider fan so it goes without saying that I'm recommending this. However, even if you're not familiar with any of the older TRs, if you're an action/adventure fan or interested in exploring ancient Egypt, I believe you'll really enjoy this.","February 16, 2015","true","12.1"," 27 of 27 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","27","27","0","5"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lucassm/recommended/224980/","lucassm","Darius Vulkius","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lucassm/","823 products in account","Tomb Raider 4: The Last Revelation was the best TR game in my opinion. Why? Because it was a Tomb Raider game since the first one that was actuall about exploring tombs and fighting monsters (With a little appearence of bad guys). That said, let's go to the topics:\n\nGraphics: Pretty good for a 1999 game, actually. Texture variation is not so present because ambient is also not. That's because you will be put in on closed spaces more than open ones. Pyramids, temples and hidden tombs will be more seen than anything else. But the presentation of these places are actually nice, it doesn't get repetitive and you always know when a place is new or not.\n\nGameplay: Picking up the style from the other TR games, it remained the same with a few additions. Lara can now jump into ropes, walk in them and best of all: DRIVE VEHICLES! That was a nice little adition, tough i din't find the vehicles gameplay so pleasurable for me. At least at a long time ago. For me, now isn't that bad. It's pretty ok.\nGunplay feels the same from other games and doging from enemies still feels impossible, tough, as in other games, exploring is the key too fill up with medkits and ammo. Not much problem here.\nPuzzles are back and were the main focus of the game. You will waste more time on puzzles than killing enemies. They are complex, but not hard to do.\nRemember when i said i couldn't remember if the secrets followed the same pattern as TR 5? Yeah, it follows. Global statistics for secrets, no statistics per stage. And this game is HUGE, it is a big flaw to make harder to find the secrets in this game. At least, you don't win anything by finding it all, besides new weapons/items on your gameplay. Exploration is the key, once again.\n\nSoundtrack: More or less. Most of the time you will only hear ambient sounds. But when music plays, it always match with what's happening and feels like an epic adventure. Voice acting is quite decent and Lara's voice is sweet.\n\nStory: Here was the big point of this game. The plot tried to explore a bit of Lara's past at the beggining and tried to connect to the actual story that was happening. It went pretty well and many things have been done. A lot of effort was put in the Seth and Horus backstory and as more as you explore, more content is revealed. The game goes roughly for a lot of time because of this. It all went you...Until the ending. The boss battle felt so empty for me and the ending itself was quite sad and a cliffhanger.\n\nTR 4 was the best game of the franchishe for me and it was pleasurable to play. The focus on the adventure more than action served this game well for me and it made an unique experience.\nIf devs that are doing the new Tomb Raider were to see a game where they could see what they SHOULD do with the series style of play, it should be this one.","February 4, 2014","true","28.2"," 24 of 26 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","24","26","0","0"

It shouldn't be as linear as the other games before, but the gameplay itself had to be spiked with many puzzles, as fans of Tomb Raider I missed for a long time. Ancient temples and ruins are meant to be discovered once again and till that date it turned out to be Lara's biggest adventure.\n\nIt is the year 1984. Professor Werner Von Croy is on his expedition to Kambodscha to find an artefact called "The Iris". The young Lara, 16 years old at that time, reads about it in an edition from "National Geographic" and her volition to hunt for this artefact awakens. Lord Croft funded the expedition and so Lara is allowed to follow Von Croy on his exploring journey. Lara will soon find out that "The Iris" is just the start and gets a big ball rolling by her artefact hunt.\n\nWhat would be a new Tomb Raider game without new features and improved graphics? Since Tomb Raider III the overall look of the surrounding stood nearly the same. Yet, the developer smoothed out Lara's apperance with less blocks in her polygones and draw attention to the 3D effects like water surface, ambient lighting and fog. Lara got also a moving mouth in the ingame cutscenes, which are admittedly not very in sync to what she is saying but still, she appears a bit more alive now. The 3D cutscenes between the levels are well made and also highly detailed as usual.\n\nLara's arsenal changed once again. Like in every Tomb Raider game the pistols -still with unlimited ammo- uzi, grenadelauncher and shotgun are the same with a minimal reskin. The desert eagle from Tomb Raider III is replaced by the revolver and the crossbow found its way into the arsenal. New is the possibility to change the kind of ammunition for the shotgun, grenadelauncher and crossbow. Also a lasersight can be attached to the revolver and crossbow, which is required in some levels to solve a puzzle. While pressing 0 on the numpad the player will enter a sniper-like view to shoot accurate manually.\n\nLara's moves are extended again, which include the abillity to climb around edges and swing on robes.\nThe menu got a complete new reskin, everything is now on one page and can be highlighted by sidescrolling. Tomb Raider IV: The Last Revelation is also the first Tomb Raider game with destructible objects such as wooden barricades and jars, which contain often ammunition and medikits.\nOne thing that the previous games taught the player is now to erase from the memories: While closed doors were really shut and only possible to open by activating a button or a lever, Lara is now able to open some doors by her own, sometimes with the help of a crowbar. Don't let closed doors fool you.\n\nAs already mentioned, Tomb Raider IV is spiked with many intelligent puzzles, not only based on moving a block from A to B. Lara is able to combine items she has found on her journey and will reveal new ways of puzzle solving. The compass in the menu will help with some puzzles as well and even a fun minigame will let the heart from fans of this franchise leap with joy.\n\nThe linearity moved a bit away for those who like to discover on her own but with this comes the problem of easy missable objective items and cluelessness inside some levels. It was meant to change the gameplay but also harshly increases the difficulty of it. Also the backtracking irritates often, because there are mostly no hints what the player has to do. Thanksfully there are a lot of walkthroughs and guides out there, so the player does not need to stumble in the complete dark.\n\n●▬▬▬▬▬[➤ RÉSUMÉ]▬▬▬▬●\nThe fourth part of the franchise wasn't new for me, so the gameplay wasn't blind as well. Yet, after all these years I forgot a few parts of it and with the backtracking and less linearity I had trouble to find all objective items in one go.  However, the great story, the intelligent puzzles and incredible awesome levels compensate for this problem and with 35 levels (36 with the bonus level) the length of it was satisfying enough.\n\nTomb Raider IV: The Last revelation is by far my favourite of the 5 classic games, directly after Tomb Raider II of course. Worth playing for every fan of this franchise and for those who want to know how the young Lara started her artefact hunt.\n\n●▬▬▬▬▬[➤ TL;DR]▬▬▬▬●\n[✔] Improved graphics compared to Tomb Raider III\n[✔] New weapons with different kind of ammunition and an attachable lasersight\n[✔] New menu, vehicles and acrobatic movements\n[✔] Great storyline and well-made levels based in egypt\n[✔] Intelligent puzzles incl. abillity to combine items\n[✔] Destructible objects\n[✔] Less linear than the previous games\n\n[✖] Missable objective items and increased difficulty from less linearity\n[✖] Clunky keyboard-only controls\n[✖] Graphics still primitve compared to todays standards\n[✖] Fixed camera, only possible to move Lara's head\n\n●▬▬▬▬▬[➤ MEDIA]▬▬▬▬●\nhttps://youtu.be/u6f9kUpvU5U\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=624000395\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf you liked this review and want to see more from me, give this review a thumbs up!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/projectwiggy/recommended/224980/","projectwiggy","Hero One","http://steamcommunity.com/id/projectwiggy/","79 products in account","When it comes to the exciting outings of Lara, Core Design's 'The Last Revelation' is, for me, the pinnacle of the Tomb Raider series.\n\nAs a fresh return to the series' roots, the fourth game focuses more on high adventure and exciting exploration, sending the player on an epic journey across ancient locations in Egypt to resolve a prophecy that spans millennia.\n\nGone are gloomy London skylines and secret military installations of the previous two games. Instead of diving into underwater bases, Lara will delve into ancient tombs and mysterious ruins. You'll search for archaic artifacts instead of keycards, dodging devious traps and whirling blades, instead of laser wires and auto-turrets. The game still has plenty of frenetic gunplay, with new weapons, ammo choices and smarter enemies. But exploration and puzzles take centre stage here.\n\nThe atmosphere is fantastic. You'll feel isolated as you tiptoe through dark corridors, treading where no foot as stepped for centuries. The graphics are a step up, but the sound makes the most impact. Musical cues still feature, but for the most part you'll hear nothing but your own footsteps, the wind rolling through passageways, and the occasional crumble of stones somewhere in the distance. Exploration has never been so exciting or tense!\n\nThe game is well balanced. Tomb Raider 3 often had me wandering aimlessly around, not  sure where to go; Levels were completed almost by accident. Here, everything makes sense: You'll always know the item you need to proceed - even if you don't know where it is. The puzzles are challenging, but never tedious trial and error. A great feat, considering puzzles can span multiple levels and require multiple items. You'll rarely find yourself backtracking simply to see if you missed a hidden switch or obscure item.\n\nOverall, the game provides the series' best adventure. It gets the important parts right, and brings enough fresh features to keep the series interesting. Highly recommended.\n","May 7, 2015","true","15.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You can also change controls for keyboard which is nice addition as controls you "begin" with are funny as hell (like 0 on numpad is "Look", ; for "Crouch", Delete for "Sidestep" and so on)..\nMusic is okay in my opinion, nothing spectacular..\nGameplay wise there is much more to explore than previous Tomb Raiders in series. With lot of secrets and hidden rooms you will find yourself revisiting areas back and forth to try to find all of them (and trust me some of those secrets are well hidden). Since Im fan of Egypt mythology, level desings for me were awsome. Visiting tombs of their gods, Temples, Cleopatras Palace, Pyramids and Alexandria itself and more with all of them being huge places to explore will leave you entertained for some time. Puzzles are among the best in Tomb Raider series and sometimes will leave you wondering what to do there. Lara controls fairly okay but sometimes it can be frustrating mostly with jumping on or of something. Somtimes she wont jump at all, sometimes she will jump but wont catch anyting on other side and fall to her death, and my favorite swinging on rope where she sometimes wont even catch the rope even if there is enough place for her to catch... And water.... dont get me start on swimming, dont know who tought her to swim....\nAnd for some ending to this bit longer review story is great (wont spoil anything, go play it for yourelf, pay now!)\n\nThis game holds special place in my heart since this was game I played with my father all the time (even tho we barely knew how to complete it) and since he is no longer here with us it stays as a memory of good times we had...\n\nAnyway, I would definitely recommend this game to anyone who played or did not played any of Tomb Raider games, it is wort the try atleast.\n9.5/10","May 10, 2015","true","8.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Von Croy was Lara's mentor who taught her the methods of exploring ruins and tombs. This game excludes Croft manor as a visitable location for training. Instead the game offers a flashback of a teen Lara in a training level, exploring the roots of how she became the adventurer we know. This flashback also serves an importance to her present day adventure which takes place entirely in Egypt. In what is the longest Tomb Raider game play experience to go through. The game like the previous games has it's share of challenges, but still a worthy experience to go through. Lara Croft is more detailed in character design along with slight improvements in the details of the locations. With the variety of puzzles and a large number of enemies to deal with, will make this yet another good addition to any Tomb Raider fan.","June 22, 2015","true","0.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Ok, other than Lara having a Makeover and some swanky new lighting affects, the graphics haven't changed much at all over the last four games, the Gameplay is still more or less the same use of awkward controls, but there is still a diamond in the rough here. I was having fun!\n\nAnd then came levels like Alexandria.\n\nWhoever says Tomb Raider has good level design is lying or mad... or likely both. It consists of the most random level plans, unexplained puzzles (that even after reading Tutorials make absolutely no sense whatsoever in the context of the time, the language, the culture).\n\nSorting out the random hieroglyphics into the English alphabet, and then putting it into alphabetical order. But Why? Why in alphabetical order to start with? There is no hint given as to why, it just is... but even worse... our Alphabet came into being a couple of thousand years after this tomb was built!\n\nSo these great people of Egypt, with their time travel machines, glimpsed into the future, saw our Alphabet, then amazingly decided to change all of their language and hieroglyphics to be matching one of our letters (which essentially means that the Egyptians wrote in English, but used pictures as representation for each letter... no Core, that is not how it is. That is truly terrible puzzle design.\n\nAh hell, why bother trying to even explain it.\n\nThis game feels like something a 11 year old would make today in his lunch break at school. It feels like one persons over exited child was in charge of building levels, while the entire rest of the staff worked on the CGI films, that for it's time were pretty steller, to tie in some nonsensical plot that is very much from a time where games were not story tellers... ah hell, but they tried.\n\nSo the levels are random, convoluted, blocky horribleness that have actually gotten worse with every single iteration of the series. I can hear the games director's demands:\n\n"New engine? NAH! new gameplay ideas? NAH! what we need is, LONGER, MORE COMPLICATED BUG RIDDEN LEVELS THAT NO ONE WILL BE ABLE TO COMPLETE WITHOUT A WALKTHROUGH." ... Genius.\n\nTalking of which, to all the fans who will  undoubtedly vote me down, how many of you completed this game without a walk-through?\n\nYeah, I can hear the tumble weeds bouncing down the street too.\n\nThe only person who ever completed this without help, was the person who wrote the official walkthrough... but even that's not true, as he had help from Core. If the standard user can not finish your game without a walkthrough, no matter how smart you are (as these puzzles have absolutely NOTHING to do with intelligence) then you game is broken. There is no arguing around that.\n\nThere is a reason that the beloved Tomb Raider, PSX's best original series died (as it was) along with Core. Good riddance!\n\n2/10 (and it only get's above a 1 because, well you know, Tomb Raider!)","March 2","false","21.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

From the title screen music to the final boss fight, there isn't a moment that isn't amazing, challenging or just lovably goofy (read: The Guardian).

We never finished it back then, not until last year when I completed the Steam version - which is by far the best looking one. The atmosphere, the Egypt story and the old school platformer gameplay makes this arguably the best TR ever made. In some ways it's a scary game, you're alone and the focus is on exploring the environment, avoiding deadly traps while solving puzzles. If you thought the new TR was easy and too action oriented, I recommend playing this game. To put it another way; TR4 demonstrates an era of gaming when game developers made their games very challenging, a level of challenge that would trouble today's casual gamers, but definitely a very fun experience especially if you're a gamer from that era. 9/10","February 7, 2015","true","28.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Cause this game is exacly as it was for PS1, truste me i spend a lot of time trying to reach the end until i gave up, because i was only like 6 or 8 and couldnt understand the complexity of the puzzles nor could i control lara very well (still can't), and the game was so long with so many levels (yeah im from the time when u complained about the game beeing so damm long, now u hv 8 to 20h of gameplay, thats what seems to be the average).\n\nSo if u love lara, like i do\nif u played all of her games, expecialy the older ones\n\nyeah buy this one, its the best, i repeat the BEST tomb raider yet, (and i didnt finished it, unlike all others) and is totaly worth it expecialy on sale","September 30, 2015","true","6.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you've played the more recent Tomb Raiders, playing this will likely feel very different.\n\nDespite me being left sour with the ending, I still recommend this game.

On top of this there are more varied environemtns, with less of a 'blocky' feel to them. Also, playing these games on a modern computer, TR4 is the first one where there haven't been any major problems while playing the FMV cutscenes. The game still has some issues playing at higher resolutions, but that is only to be expected.\n\nIn addition to this, there is an improvement in the storytelling, I find. This game is the first where everything seems to follow a logical storyline, and the use of fmv and in-level cutscenes does a good job of telling this. Rather than jumping everywhere around the world, you stay in Egypt, which I feel gives the game more of a chance to build up the story than the previosu ones, which jumped about a lot.\n\nOne down side to this game is that it has a lot fo the two things which I like the least about tomb raider games: Vehicles and Backtracking. If you've played a TR game before, you know how bad the vehicles are. Clunky and terrible, but you need to them to progress the level. The back tracking isn't too bad in this game, so I guess that's more a matter of personal preference.\n\nThe controls are not said to support xbox controllers, but it actually is possible to use one without resorting to a third-party tool, although you need to manually configure it, and it only seems to support one analog stick.\n\nAll in all, if you are new to TR and want to play one of the earlier TR games, I think this would be a good one to play.","May 16","true","31.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Tombs were replaced with modern architecture and wild animals with an over abundance of gun toting muscle men.\nThankfully The Last Revelation gets the series back on track and feels to me like it should have been the second game rather than the fourth.\nEvery ounce of the original Playstation's power was wrung in order to improve the graphics. If you compare the character model of Lara from the 1996 original to the one in Tomb Raider IV you will see a marked improvement.\nModern locations like opera houses and submarine bases have been replaced for pyramids and tombs.\nThe entire story takes place in one location this time (Egypt) and the experience feels all the batter for it.\nI'm quite disappointed that controlling Lara often feels like driving a bus still. The controls and lack of a free camera are infuriating. Nintendo cracked the basic formula for free camera with Super Mario 64 three years earlier, perhaps if Eidos had allowed Core more time between releases they could have created a new engine or at least improved upon the clunky fixed camera mechanisms for the original.\nI don't know who is leaving gun ammo and health packs in ancient tombs and vases  but it's a little rediculous. Couldn't a more realistic system have been designed at this point; it breaks the fantasy.\nFinally, this game's tutorial section fails to explain all of the new gameplay mechanisms so players may find themselves scratching their heads later on. For example, how was I supposed to know that binoculars have an infrared feature that when used can highlight hidden writing at certain points in the game when the tutorial never explained it to me and none of the previous games had this feature?\nTomb Raider IV also allows the player to revisit previous levels. Great, but it also allows the player to leave a section without an item they will need to complete the game later on and then prevents them from returning. There is no warning, so make sure you have plenty of save files just in case!\n\nIn conclusion, a good game, better than Tomb Raider II and III, but let down by, ironically, a lack of necessary handholding.\n\n8/10\n","May 24","true","36.8"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"
