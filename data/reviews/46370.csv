Don't spend your money on this game.","April 16, 2014","false","0.5"," 99 of 132 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","99","132","2","10"

Looking at this as a truck-themed arcade game, and you'll praise:\n\n• An amazing map - no prefabricated undersized intersections. The bespoke highways are properly scaled and a joy to drive on. You can do more than 30mph without tipping over. The map itself is huge - takes several hours to cross despite higher speeds and straighter roads than ETS\n\n• You can see your hired drivers on the road as they work, and join them in competitive jobs\n\n• A far, far, far more detailed truck diagnostics system than other games. Worn brake pads grind against the discs and degrade braking performance. Panels get beat up, the engine runs like crap.\n\n• The truck upgrade system is excellent and features things like side and rear mounted cameras to cover blind spots.\n\n• Cops (could be a con for some!)\n\n• Nice side-missions, help out hitchhikers if you want, pick up extra jobs from cafés or over the radio\n\nThat isn't to say this game is without flaws. The iffy handling and dodgy physics are geared to racing, not driving. There are competitive jobs where you are pitted against other drivers to race cargo to its destination (very unrealistic). There are also truck races and out-of-this-world missions to complete, too.\n\nIn summary, don't look at it as a sim and you will be able to forgive its shortcomings. Go for a race or forgive the iffy handling and go for a really scenic drive.","July 19, 2014","true","83.5"," 27 of 31 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","27","31","0","0"

No? Well it's like that. This game is fun. It actually has cutscenes in which people actually talk unlike most simulators.

I was arrested and even when being arrested there's a short cutscene. Yes, this review sucks. Boohoo. I don't care. This is a real world truck sim. Whereas Euro Truck Sim is a truck driving sim.

Unlike Euro Truck Simulator, there is visible, physics based damage. Driving into traffic will result in the cops being called, guns drawn. The game's story mode however is archaic. The spoken dialogue slightly differs from what appears in the forced-on closed captions.\n\nThere's blatant sexual tokenization of women as well from the outset with your "footloose and fancy-free" secretary - your character even asks "is she married?"\n\nFrom playing it on Windows 8.1, the mouse cursor doesn't move with where your mouse is on screen, which led to half an hour trying to visualize where to hover my mouse to program my non-existent game controller settings.\n\nThe game needs an update to fix this rather dire issue.\n\nThis game probably actually has a lot to offer, but it's not aged gracefully in both on a cultural, and technical level.","June 20, 2014","false","0.5"," 8 of 19 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","8","19","0","0"

They had released a very good game about Russian truck drivers several years before.\nThey planned to adapt this game for players all over the world. But the development was too long and graphics wasn't very good even at release day. The potential of this game was great. But reality forced developers released the game "as is".\nBesides that this game don't run well with most joystiks or controllers.\nSo if you want to see nice picture and use X-Box controller for playing games you should choose Euro Truck Simulator 2.

Before I played it, I thought they just drove from one warehouse to the other lining their pockets with cash. But once I found out that every time they bump into something, drive slightly off the road, or go ten miles over the speed limit they have cops trying to run them down to arrest them, that changed everything. I know this game is supposed to be a simulator, and I'm sure from time to time truckers do get arrested, especially coming back from Mexico, but did they really have to put that aspect into the game?\n\nI've played a few trucking simulators before and none of them had me getting ripped out of my cab, thrown to the hood of a car, and arrested for "assaulting a police officer". Seriously, I got arrested for that. When the heck did I assault a police officer? I haven't even gotten out of my truck! And why the heck does it always look like it's raining on my windshield, even when it isn't? Ugh. Okay, fine, whatever, that doesn't sound SO bad, right? Okay, but since when do truckers have to compete with one another to get their load to the warehouse first so they can get paid? Yep, this game makes delivering cargo into a race to the finish line with three other hungry truckers. Oh, you want money for food and other living expenses? Better get here first! What the heck is this, the Hunger Games? But what else did I expect from a 1C Racing game? I should have known better.\n\nAside from the ridiculousness though, this game has some decent views, not such awful graphics, and once you get it configured with a controller (which is a massive pain in the butt), it isn't a complete mess. But don't get me wrong, this game should be avoided. Stay far, far away from this game. And if you actually want a good trucking simulator, pick up a copy of Euro Truck Simulator 2, that game is amazing. Unless you wanna pretend that in this game you're smuggling around a truckload of drugs to make it more believable. But who wants to use their imagination? We bought the game specifically so that we didn't have to do that!","January 8, 2015","false","2.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It exceeded my expectations at all levels save one; the graphics performance is underwhelming. It's running at sub 60fps, not at minimum settings but even at minimum doesn't seem improve the frame rate. OK aside from performance issues, i have not encountered big bugs except in the initial stages after i had done a lot of tweakings. It randomly crashed twice while i was driving. Maybe it was due to too many changes and clicking the apply button. All is well now but with a slightly low performance as mentioned before.\n\nSo what's so good about this game? Well it's more than a truck ♥♥♥ business sim; it's also has a story.\n\nLets go over the features.\n\n1) As a truck sim there are;\n\na) Headlights\nb) Signal lights\nc) Wipers\nd) Parking brake\ne) Engine brake\nf) Truck equipment / component upgrades\ng) repairs & maintenance costs\nh) fuel requirement\ni) hazard lights\nj) horn\nk) and of course, buying more trucks and upgrading your own truck (like in Hard Truck 2)\n\n2) As a business sim there are;\n\na) Hire & fire drivers\nb) buying more trucks\nc) monitoring schedules\nd) managing cash flow\ne) expanding business reach by adding offices in other towns\nf) competing with other companies (like in Hard Truck 2)\n\n3) As a story;\n\na) a personal log of encounters along the way\nb) cutscenes of your journey aka story\nc) detailed animated characters\nd) excellent voice acting\n\nSo what about the environment? Well it's good enough at low settings so it should be pretty impressive if maxed out. The road curves and hills are smooth, no jarring crude polygons as it once were in Hard Truck 2. No road mines either so that's a relief! Day and night cycles and weather cycles. The roads and highways, they are expansive and very impressive, at least to me. While driving from town to town there's plenty to see of the environment though some might disagree.\n\nAnd driving physics? Seems very good, you can see the motion of the suspension on the individual wheels. Keyboard sensitivity can be adjusted from fast to slow. So does the centering rate. These 2 settings are very useful in finding the right balance to suit individual driving preference.\n\nWhat about graphics and sound quality? All great! Trucks look detailed both in and out. Reflection details and rate of update can be adjusted many levels. Shadow details and viewing distance can also be adjusted many levels. Same with HDR and truck detail levels. In short all adjustable settings are graduated from 1 to 10 steps. Some settings only have on or off. It should be quite easy to find the right balance of quality and performance for any machine that meets the system requirements. Engine whirr and growl sounds real IMO. Radio stations play a wide selection of quality music. You can even add your own station like in Test Drive Unlimited.  Radio is one aspect where Rig 'n' Roll shine. You can hear up to 3 people talking in between music at random and they are rather funny & witty. What is even more amazing is the fact that the talking voices even interrupts your radio station.\n\nFinal aspect, nearly neglected to mention is the brilliant AI which ties the whole game together and is nothing short of amazing. Where in most other driving or racing games, the traffic or NPC AI is either dumb or gets in the way or pops in & out of existence at random just to block your path; in this game that rarely happens, even when you're racing with other AI truckers. AI traffic & other AI truckers not participating in the same cargo run, would never get in your way unless overtaking another AI traffic which is in-front of them. Even when your're driving against the flow, the AI traffic & other AI trucks cleverly avoid head-on collision. AI seems to extend even to the radio interruptions. For example; they might talk about the need to upgrade engine when your diving rather slowly in a race. The talking voices isn't there just to lend a live effect to the stations they also talk about random events that are happening in the game. Some messages given by the radio appears in your journal as clickable entries which may include random quests. Therefore turning on the radio becomes a necessity if you want to participate in the random events.\n\nCops are very aggressive and tenacious. It's almost impossible to lose them. If you go to a warehouse, they will follow you in or be waiting outside and continue the chase when you leave. If you refuse to stop, more cops will chase you and try to run you off the road. The resulting fines and damages to your rig can negate all rewards for the delivery or race run. So it's usually best to stop & pay-up at the first sign of a siren. Though it's possible to lose them, should they catch you later the previous fines are added to the current one. Also any accidents involving AI vehicles is deemed your fault no matter what; the cops are on a mission to give you a hard time. Never cross a yellow line in front of a cop or they will chase you to hell and back! Despite all the problems the cops can dish out, there's a neat feature called save game which can be made at any time while driving so you can immediately undo that horrible crash or wong turn you just made. ;)\n\nGame world is huge, beautiful and detailed. The lighting and reflection effects on the road when it drizzles and vehicle surfaces are impressive. It's best to look around while driving to appreciate the game world but accurate and dexterous finger work is a must to avoid crashing into objects while not looking where you are going and controlling the camera views simultaneously. This game is a big improvement over Hard Truck 2 in all aspects. Glad i bought it despite the 'Mostly Negative' rating at the time of this writing.\n\nLastly you don't need a wheel to drive well in this game; it works just fine with a keyboard. But you'll need a high-end rig to get the most out of it. Don't miss this underrated gem; try it for yourself. I absolutely love it! 4/5 stars.\n\nhttp://games.dailymotion.com/video/x2j2s6g?utm_source=dailymotion&utm_medium=autopromo&utm_campaign=fromplayertogames","March 6, 2015","true","68.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I will agree with most of the reviews on here. first and foremost THIS IS NOT A SIMULATOR. this is a arcade truck driving game. In my opinion this game has decent graphics for American trucks, and at present (to my knowledge) is the newest american truck driving game out until American Truck SImulator. but as stated earlier two entirely seperate games. Some Pros: Freightliner endorsed, variety of cargo, scenery is decent to look at (looks just like the california intersate) Traffic controls (for those that like light or no traffic) and there is a story line.  CONS: bad physics, low grade interior graphics, cops are too touchy, and the game is incomplete (as in-game the radio talks about and advertise a Las-Vegas add on yet it never was made). Closing Remarks: Play the game with an open mind and i think you will like it. as some have mentioned about no waypoints in the beginning of the game, just drive for a bit and something will happen.","February 13, 2015","true","92.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you want an americian trucking game either wait for Americian Truck Simulator or go check out the 18 Wheels of Steel games because I had enjoyed those ones. So I would rate this game a 6.8/10. Once again I am on the edge here but I will recommend it because I got a few hours of enjoyment out of it.","June 1, 2015","true","11.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is not the one you want... This was a real waste of my money and alot of my time. Seriously. I spent like, 10 minutes waiting on the world to load just for my first delivery. This game made me realize how much time I can wait for SCS to bring out American Truck Simulator, cause I can already tell it'll be a Hell-of-alot better than this game.","January 28","false","1.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
