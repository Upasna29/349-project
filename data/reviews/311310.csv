You also have a fair variety of options so you can tweak your game if it doesn't run at its best, I personally am running at highest graphics without FXAA & AA and I am getting 60 FPS no problem ( i5 4670k & GTX 960 if you want to know )\n\nShips\nWhen you get into the game, you start with a "Basic Cutter", it is a very decent ship, and I would suggest sticking to it for a while, be sure to "play around" and see how you like to play since it will be important later on. In the store you will see 7 rates of ships, what this means is that the ships are divided into classes, as they were, with 1 being your heaviest ( Santisima & Victory ) and 7 being lightest ( Lynx, Cutter etc. )\n\nTrading\nTrading, I don't yet know much about but it also plays a big role in the game, you transport cargo from one place to another, buying for less and selling for higher, there are specialised trading ships in the game which offer more space for the cargo, however, these ships usually make easy targets for pirates or other ships in general, so you should most likely do it with a friend!\n\nCombat\nThe game is fairly realistic, so battles are generally very slow and take time, you basically have to outmanouver your opponent and turn his ship into swiss cheese! The sounds are also great so hearing bigger ships fire feels very rewarding and very immersive. For battle, you also have a nice variety of customization, you can buy cannons for your ship ( Watch out for what class of gun you're buying, you can get confused! ), and in battle you'll have three basic ammo types, ball, chain & grape. Oh and, you can board ships! Yes! Sadly, you can't see the actual fight, it's more of a turn game, where luck and tactics decide the outcome\n\nThings to mention\nThe game is alpha, so there are bugs\nThe loading screens are very humorous\nThe game is very grindy\nDon't sail in big ships while low level! ( The way it works is the higher level you are, the bigger crew you can have, imagine sailing a Frigate with 40 men! )\nThere is a map, but you have to know how to navigate! ( You can't see your location on the map )\nI hope this review helped!","January 24","true","100.7"," 472 of 490 people (96%) found this review helpful 22 people found this review funny","96","472","490","22","18"

I bought the game two nights ago and already have almost 24 hours logged. I've assaulted two ports alongside massive fleets and levelled my profile to level three. Everything in the game feels solid, from the level up speed to the sense of achievement.\n\nThe game almost works like Mount and Blade: Warband does in regards to the sailing map. Time is sped up and you can find/initiate battles anywhere in the world. These battles take place in smaller "instances" just like M&B.\n\nThe combat is nice and firing cannons feels and sounds satisfying. Gameplay is very engaging because you can choose what your cannons shoot; cannon balls, chained cannon balls or grapeshot. Each type has a different effect on the target. The ability to play with a clan or friends is very useful for many poeple, but it is also possible to enjoy the game while playing solo (like me).\n\n8.7/10 in it's current state, insane amounts of potential that can be harnessed by the devs if they introduce things like better upgrades for ships, more options for traders or even just more ships in general.\n\nNote: Do not buy this game if you want literally 24/7 action. The game has an element of simulation to it, so do not expect an arcade experience with constant stimulation. The game requires you to sail and spend time making good decisions.\n\nEDIT (70 hours playtime): Since this review has gotten so much attention, I feel like I should update it with more of my thoughts. This game isn't just about getting bigger ships and more gold. It offers a unique sensation you feel when you participate in something bigger than yourself. Seeing the United States chat spam "USA USA USA" after every victory is funny, but also simultaneously very thrilling. Accomplishing goals alongside teammates and knowing that you contributed is a special kind of sensation. Most people feel it through organized team sports, but I can also feel it through Naval Action. Only a few games have ever gotten this feeling out of me (Planetside 2 and good ol' Minecraft faction server days to name a couple).\nTLDR; the satisfaction of teamwork and contributing to your nation's fights is where a lot of the fun comes from in Naval Action, at least for me.","January 25","true","115.2"," 172 of 186 people (92%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","92","172","186","6","0"

Absolutely worth it for anyone interested in piracy, sailships or just simply the "Age of Sails".\n\nThe ships in the game are absolutely magnificent. They really put effort into making them and anyone who loves building models of these old but majestic ships will certainly love the amount of detail and work put into the ships, not to mention being able to see the ships "come alive" as they sail across the sea in the game.\n\nAnother beautiful (though some might say terrifying) part of the game is the combat. Watching a ship as it turns with the wind, all it's gun ports open, the barrels of every cannon aimed directly at your ship and then seeing the rolling broadside as each gun is fired in succession is simply fantastic (and, yes, terrifying). The muzzleflashes light up the side of the ship and the sails, but is quickly hidden within a thick cloud of gunpowder smoke. Often the smoke from the gunpowder is so thick and heavy that entire ships can be hidden behind it. And the sound of the cannons is brilliant. They have loud, deep booms which scale as you get larger cannons, or even carronades.\n\nThe part of the game that still requires the most development though is the Open World part. This part of the game is still very barebones (the basic framework is up but it requires more work for certain, but then again, it IS alpha stage). The UI is largely, perhaps even entirely, a placeholder UI. The functionality is there, but it is not very appealing (again, it is alpha so beautification comes later).\n\nIs this game worth it ?\n\nIn my opinion, absolutely! If you like sailships, definitely. If you liked the old Sid Meiers Pirates or Pirates of the Burning Sea, then absolutely.\n\nHowever, as always, I encourage people to watch Youtube videos, reviews, twitch streams and so on to get a better idea of what the game is about, how it works, what it looks like and so on to make a decision.\n\nAnyways, long wall of text, but then again, it's meant for someone curious about the game :)","February 12","true","212.6"," 190 of 212 people (90%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","90","190","212","9","2"

Naval Action is purely a ship based game, no walking on land or walking around on the ships however this does not mean that boarding is not a thing, whether you are a pirate or you sail for any of the numerous navies you can capture enemy ships and either take her a prize, sell her or even just sink her and keep the possible loot for your self for trading purposes.\n\nThe game also features a crafting system which you can use to craft ships, however if crafting is not something for you you can buy ships from the stores or find a crafter which can craft a ship to your specifications, there are plenty of crafters out there.\n\nUpgrades allow you to change the qualities of your ships, most upgrades have some short of downside which means that you have to pick and choose which ones best fit your style, you also have a limited amount of upgrades slots and if your ship looses all its durabilities(lives) you will loose the ship and all its durabilites\n\nPositives:\n-many beautiful ships ranging from the tiny lynx(schooner) to the giant first rate 138 gunner that is the santisima\n\n-an open world with ports and plenty of enemies to fight\n\n-Great visuals and amazing looks\n\n-simple UI\n\n-everything isnt done for you, navigation and such is up to you so you can get lost\n\n-Both PVE and PVP servers so if you dont like PVP you can always be on the PVE server and be sure that you are safe from getting attacked by players, however if you like PVP join on in the exciting PVP on the PVP Server!\n\nNegatives:\n-UI although simple is not the most easy to use as it is very much work in progress and it does not look pretty\n\n-the game can be very demanding on your system, you need at least a decent cpu and gpu to play the game thus stopping entry level systems from being able to run this game at decent(30 fps and above) frame rates\n\n-No tutorial(there is a good beginners guide by me here though: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPAlcJFarVY&list=PLXxCN4OQuXYfe8cdzta7S8E0Ku5yNR790&index=1)\n\nNeutral:\n\n-The travel time on the Open World can be a bit excessive however depending on the person, it might be too fast or too slow, I find it personally fine where it is\n\nrecommended links:\nNaval action wiki: http://navalaction.wikia.com/\nVideo guides by olav:  https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXxCN4OQuXYfe8cdzta7S8E0Ku5yNR790","January 21","true","395.5"," 304 of 365 people (83%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","83","304","365","17","29"

Well let's cover a few things, first up is open world. Now the Open World is vast, it is the Carribbean and it is geographically accurate to every minute island that is present. Theres multiple ports, for all factions and you can capture ports of other factions. Every port produces goods, uses goods and is either shallow or deep (meaning what ind of ship you can take in). So now lets go into the battles, theyre gorgeous. The sounds, the feel, the waves and sky. Its all gorgeous. The battles take place in instances and whatever happens in the world around your instance also happens there. Theres multiple ship types, gun types, you can get missions from the admiralty (go here and kill this pirate) or you can trade, you can just hunt traders or go after contraband smugglers in your own faction. Now lets go into the bad parts. The forums are a place where nobody can disagree with the fanboys, if you are an American player the admins have something agagainst you, such as suggesting an idea it is usually immediately shot down but when the same admin sees on the Russian forums the same idea they praise it as brilliance. The second one is the grind, it is absolutely asinine in the early stages and just manages to make it worse on the higher levels. You start off with a garbage ship and no money and on average a fight will last you 30-45 mins for 50xp and a bit of gold. Now youre thinking thats not bad, but the amount of XP you need to reach rank 2 is 1000. Thats absolutely ridiculous. The AI is also some kind of super human with everything they do is absolutely perfect such as aiming, sailing, taking NO penalties to loss of crew (usually slows reaction time and steering down a terrible degree). PVP is there and its pretty meh. Unless you plan on doing nothing but dedicating all your time to this game this isn't for you. While the battles, crafting and sounds are fun it is drawn down by terrible AI, awful forums and bad decisions by the forum community who the devs listen to. I would give it a 7/10 however I do recommend it if you arent active in the forums and just want to play.\nEdit: Adjusted to 7/10 due to very quick patches and on time updates that are balanced.","January 21","true","261.2"," 175 of 219 people (80%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","80","175","219","10","10"

The developers of Naval Action have been highly influenced in developing their game by Pirates of the Burning Sea which is incredible to me having been a former PotBS player. Naval Action has a modern graphics engine(that looks amazing), but when you play it you get the distinct feel of PotBS minus the avatars. I for one miss what PotBS was and it will always occupy a special place in my gaming experience. So to see a game that is essentially in homage to PotBS is impressive and a must buy in my opinion.\n\nMost importantly and the reason I’m posting here, is the developers of Naval Action have been extremely interactive with the community and open to suggestions. Most of the major game features have been voted on and discussed on the forum extensively with the community. They are not making Naval Action in a vacuum and are using the forum as a sounding board to develop the game that the community wants. Naval Action is clearly being developed as a labor of love by some truly talented people. I’d love to see many people buy Naval Action to add their voices to the community and help make this game everything it should be.\n\nNow while I’m very excited about Naval Action, it does play very slow and is like an age of sail simulator. It  emphasizes developing skills very much like an FPS like aiming individual cannons to hit their targets, adjusting your yardarms manually, and plotting open sea travel. Nonetheless, the potential of Naval Action is enormous and with a little polish it could become an incredible gaming experience.\n\nLastly, If you think $40 is too expensive for an early access game then I defy you to find another game similar to Naval Action with an active population which is still in development. It is not a cookie cutter game, but a unique experience that is worth every cent of the purchase price.\n\nI’d like to invite you to Naval Action and hope you enjoy the journey as much as I have.\n\nCheers!","January 21","true","318.0"," 148 of 183 people (81%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","81","148","183","6","8"

From Cutthroats to Sea Dogs. From Sid Meier’s to Buccaneer to even getting The Patrician series as it had sailing ships in it.\nHowever, I’ve played nothing that is quite like this. Bar, maybe, the sea battles of Sea Dogs. But this categorically leaves Sea Dogs in Davey Jones’s locker along with the rest of the afore mentioned.\nI’m not saying those games are bad. That’s not true. I played Cuttroats in the 1990’s for hour upon hour. Hunting for that all but elusive Spanish treasure galleon.\nI just loved the fact that you had a PC game and you could do ANYTHING you wanted to do. They are all an open book to be written as you feel fit. Though, some did have a story line that you could follow, if you so desired.\nNaval Action is, in my opinion, stunning. The graphics. The ships. You can even build your own ship!! The sea battles. The game play. OK! It may not be for some. I’m sure that some will find it a little tedious to sail from place to place. But I find it tedious that a lot of PC games are just "wham, bang, thank you mam", type of games where there very little thought, but lots of action.\nThe fact that in Naval Action, you CAN and WILL get lost in the middle of the Caribbean Sea is... Is... Something to be really proud of.\nMost likely, you’ll get lost by your own stupid human error. Setting sail from Cuba, you’re headed south to Jamaica. All is OK for the first 10 minutes. Then 10 minutes ends up being 20 minutes and it is now that you start to look around the sea for signs. ANY signs. No Land. No Ships. Not even a flippin’ Albertros to blame. It’s getting dark. The sun’s setting and there’s a mist spreading over the becalming sea. That picture had taken your mind away from your immediate predicament. But regardless, you still watch it slowly setting.\nThen it’s back to reality.\nWhere the heck am I?\nWhat direction did I put myself in?\nSo you check. Why was I heading South East, when I just needed to head South?\nOh! Well. At least the designers of the game have given you and “emergency beacon” to use. Use it and it lets you teleport back to your capital city. Depending on which of the numerous nations you decide to choose from at the beginning of the game.\nBut this is almost a use once option. You use it and afterwards, you cannot use it again for another 3hours of game play. So it is to be used at your discretion and used wisely.\nSo, in summing up.\nIf you like the tall ships of the 18th century (And frankly, who doesn’t?).\nIf you would like to command one (And who wouldn’t?)?\nIf you like the Caribbean?\nIf you like a thoughtful game, which has enough intense action in battles, then getting this game would be a most welcome and very wise move, on your part.\nSadly, I have to go now and sort my rat infested ship. Then off to try and sort out my flea infested, pox ridden scurvy crew by keeping their tempers blithe with a barrel or two of rum.\nOh! Well. The life of an 18th century ships commander isn’t all about treasure, rum, wooden legs, walking the plank and warm seas. It’s not about loosing off a broadside of cannons against some foe and, well, finding the curvaceous talents of the even looser women found in some stinking drinking hole in a place they deem fit to call a port.\n“So.

I see another game with a huge amount of potential that could turn into something great -- and in a lot of ways it reminds me of old EVE. I hope Naval Action doesn't squander that potential.\n\nThis is not a complex game.\n\nI know, judging from a number of reviews on here, you might assume this is a complicated and convoluted game. It is not. Please do not let these opinions discourage you from trying this game -- It is very close to exceptional.\n\nI can see how some people might be intimidated with how the game appears upon initially starting it up. However, if you stick with it, you'll learn it very quickly. There is also an in-game "Help" channel that is quite useful, and many YouTube tutorial videos at your disposal. Personally, I was able to teach myself the game in less than two hours without using videos. I did search the forums for a couple things, but I was able to find answers fairly easily.\n\n1. Is this game worth $40?\nYes, I believe it is. When you consider the amount of content already, considering it is an early access MMO, it certainly justifies the price tag. I come from a generation very much accustomed to paying $15 monthly for MMO access, so one in the sub-$60 range and without subscription fees is quite welcome. I do understand the reluctance to pay into an unfinished game, but that's a whole other discussion entirely.\n\n2. Do you have to like naval ships/trading in order to enjoy this game?\nNo, not at all. In fact, I am more of a third-person shooter, survival, and sci-fi gamer. It's actually caused me to start reading about old ships and sailing when I never have before.\n\n3. Are you saying this game is like Eve Online? I played that game and it sucked.\nNo. This game is a lot more engagingly interactive. The combat is action-packed, and very intense. It has none of the bad qualities of Eve.\n\nThere's more I could say, but I think you should really just try it. I ended up keeping it, and I'm glad I did.","January 24","true","24.1"," 101 of 119 people (85%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","85","101","119","4","2"

Last night I noticed that the shallows near islands had become sand beaches and rocky shoals.   Another upgrade to the whole visual aspect of the game.   Watch some of the videos.\n\nThere are a few negative reviews regarding the grind and the time it takes to sail from place to place.  Also about nothing being fast and taking too long to complete.\n\nHave you ever sailed in a yacht on a sunny day? You really do not get anywhere fast.\n\nReal life age of sail battle could take all day to resolve if they even were resolved.  In Naval Action you could be in a battle well over an hour  and then sink if you can't escape a losing battle.  It is the age of sail after all.\n\nIf you want instant gratification and super powerful ships the moment you buy and join the game then you might as well go elsewhere.   You need to earn your place on the seas and there is a lot of help for you to get where you need to be to have fun in larger ships and sail with skill.\n\nThe initial grind can be very frustrating but everyone in the game has to do it. There are legal in game ways to make it a bit faster but as you get better it goes faster and you gain a larger crew which allows you to sail larger ships and gives you more options as to how you want to interact.\n\nSome trade mostly and build ships. Others constantly organize port battles and manage the wars against enemies. Several like to backstab fellow pirates and pay the price.\n\nThe world is in flux. Ports change hands, Power bases grow and shrink and ships get lost.\n\nWe all have lost our best ships in a battle but live to fight again.\n\nIf you want to join a game still being improved (and sometimes in ways we might not all like being tested), still growing  with a good base of skilled people in all of the nations from all over the world, then give it a try.\n\nI have played in "free" games and pay games where bots have taken over the game and completely ruined them.  This game depends on your skill and your clan and country's ability to hold important ports for supplies and staging and not on some computer bot working against you.\n\nJoin the grind, join the community and enjoy the game.   There is nothing more enjoyable than after an hour or more of tough battle with cannons firing, smoke wafting across the water and hearing your crew cheer when the dreaded enemy loses a mast and then you sink or board the ship and seize it!","April 19","true","379.9"," 83 of 100 people (83%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","83","83","100","3","2"

Its's a damn good game and certainly has the potential to be a very good MMO.  Let me start with the positives of this game, Keep in mind this is still in alpha.\n\n1. PvP is great. Battles can go on for 1 hour 30min, however, they dont feel like that at all. machanics are all there and keeps you intrested in the battle all the way to the end. Oh, fleet size pvp can get as big as 25 vs 25.\n\n2. Visuals are also very good, swaying over the waves as you try aiming at other countrys ships to sink it. priceless.\n\n3. Port Battles. Allthough port battles are still in develpment atm its still a joy to join up with other people from your selected nation to go capture ports from your enemys.\n\n4. A good selection of nations to pick from.\n\n5. Arr, matey, thar be ye booty!  (Be a Pirate)\n\n6. Crafting. Its still in its infancy but there is enough there atm to keep you preoccupied, although it still needs alot of work done to it.\n\n7. Board and raid other ships. destroy enemy sails with 'chain shot' then whittle down the enemy crew with 'Grape' board the ship than take the loot and ship as a prize.\n\n\nNow some stuff that is in the Gray zone, this stuff is a good idea but still needs alot of work in my eyes:\n\n1. The economy. As it stands at the point of writing this review in a alpha build, the economy is broken. There are some people that have got a monopoly on some of the goods and its very hard to get hold of some of the 'goods' to build ships. so the prices of ship building are very high and you will most likely loose any sort of profit. That said i have heard that its ok on other servers but some of the ship crafting needs to be tweeked to balance things.\n\n2. 'Durabilty'. On ships you get something called durabilty. These are effectually your lives. rate 7-5 ships have 5 dura (lifes) then rate 4-1 ships you get one less life per rate.  For me personally i would like to only see 1 life per ship but alot of people will disagree with me.\n\n3. Small ships are pretty useless and are used as a 'stepping stone' to get the next Rate ship. I would like to find a way so small ships are used later on in game.\n\n4. The map/ Open sea, Its well big. it fits in well with the game and how its done. you have to work out what direction to sail from your compuss and it can & will take hours to get to where you want to go. Its how it should be, however, its a bit boring for the eye. I do believe that they are planning to add things like storms and damage to your ships, etc... this will make it alot more dynamic\n\nNow to the bad things in this current Alpha build:\n\n1. UI is crap! its only a few blue boxes with text.\n\n2. Its very hard to just pick up the game and start playing it if your new, There is nothing to help you apart from the ingame chat.\n\n3. Missions are extremely repetitive yet they are one of the best ways to get exp and money.\n\n4. Feel the grind! The first few days i thought that the exp gain was to fast, however, that changed once i got rank 1st Lt. It takes bloody ages to grind exp and it really is quite painful.\n\n5. Current lack of content. There really isnt much in the game atm, howevewr, it is only alpha and i do know some very exciting things are going to be added and alot of rebalancing is going to happen.\n\n6. Trading is still very poor. This will get better over time but as it stands there really is not much point as it takes along time to get to port to port.\n\nThis is what i have made of the game so far from me playing it. For an Alpha stage game it really is solid and well done. If you can keep in mind that its Alpha then alot of the bugs/ balancing issues/ lack of content can be forgiven. there are somethings that i personally need to be changed but everyone is differant.\nI would suggest you watch a few streams of gameplay and ask lots of questions before buying it, i did, this will give you a better idea if you would like the game or not.\n\none of the best buys i have done for awhile, My £30 was worth every penny.\nFor an Alpha i give it a   ---- 9/10 ----","January 31","true","163.0"," 76 of 91 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","76","91","0","1"

Attend a pirate conclave with other Captains in a secret meeting place. Go to your nation's capital and walk to your Admiral's office for your next orders. Stroll around the marketplace to examine the wares and find something that strikes your fancy as you wait for your next load of cargo. Go to the shipyard and see your next ship under construction as smiths pour the molds for your bigger, better cannons. Take part in a Mount and Blade style boarding action, ,culminating in a one on one duel with the enemy captain.\n\nAll these features that would give the game much-needed extra layers of depth will never happen, as confirmed by the devs.\n\nThe game, as it stands, is playable but all except the hardest of hardcore will lose interest. The ship models are gorgeous, and the battles themselves are very fun and nerve wracking at times, but the game itself is a grindfest. Fight, level, get a bigger ship, repeat. Over and over and over. Sail for hours and hours in real time, hoping the wind will hold course long enough for you to get into port.\n\nI *want* to love this game,  but I can't.  Not for the price,  and not for the amount of content.  It seems like it's more of a proof-of-concept for what should be one mechanic of a much bigger game, and it really seems from what the devs have been saying that we'll never get that 'bigger game'. If it were $10 I would call it a must own. For now I'm going to give it a few  months and see where the concept has gone. I believe Assassin's Creed has shown that a market exists for Age of Sail games, and a AAA studio could take the core of Naval Action and make the best damn game you've ever played.\n\nEdited to include a point I made under the comments.

This couldn't be further from the truth. Every major decision is already set in stone, pretermined by polls from early backers. There is pretty much no Developer interaction - the only known Developer admin is hardly posting at all on either the Steam or the official forum.\n\nThere is no dialogue about future game mechanic changes. Giant threads of people remarkably unhappy about design decisions made in the past being broken (such as pirates not being a nation like the other 7 but very different from them) are just growing without any official word being taken into account. If a poll like the pirate mechanics vote has the overwhelming majority of 71% against pirates capturing ports, and hundreds of replies in it, it really can't be without a dev response at all.\n\nThere was a response, but you had to watch a certain twitch stream doing a Q&A session (not advertised on the forum) with an audience of 50 viewers. Not the way to do it.\n\nThere has been a single blog like post since the EA Launch six weeks ago, talking about upcoming features. One.\nIf you want information, you need to befriend moderators who are also close to the dev team, who will then feed you information that is generally kept secret so far - such as the very near economy wipe and the new economy system - e.g. Steel Sandwich on the official forum. I've received far more information that turned out to be true at this point from this hush hush source than I've received by following the developer announcement posts.\n\nAnother issue is that it is marketed as a sandbox, when that also isn't correct. There is one way to advance: sink enemy ships. Other gameplay mechanics might be in place, but they do not advance your character whatsoever. Also, they're designed in a way that you can't do them as long as you want, as you will run out of a finite, non-replenishable resource and have to wait for it to grow back - as if this was Farmville, not a full price game. Admin is also completely mute on this subject, making many economy players wonder if this game is even for them, despite it clearly being marketed as a sandbox.\n\nThis is not an Early Access game, this is basically a gofundme campaign where the developer asked for pre-purchases so he can keep developing the game that he wants. You're not paying to have your opinion heard about the game, you're not paying to help design it, you're paying to be an Alpha Tester for a game that is already finished on the whiteboard. I don't know whether that game will actually be good, because he's also pretty quiet on that subject.\n\nI do not believe this to be in the spirit of Early Access, therefore I am not recommending it.\n\nAs to how that could change: Communication can't be a one way street. The developers need to actively engage the community. Information is key. Share your roadmap. We're left in the dark what's happening within the next four weeks at this point.","March 1","false","196.4"," 283 of 429 people (66%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","66","283","429","17","9"

Music, mini games like poker where we can loose or win ships and or resources, actual boarding game where we can see crew fighting on board etc....\n- Game gets boing after a bit since it is mostly combat and crafting ships, reminds me of EVE which I have close to 2000+ hours in.\n\nSo I like what I see so far and I hope the Dev's will continue to polish this gem, I REALLY hope they do, because this has the potential to be phenominal!

I tried to flee, but they chained my sails an ultimately sank me.  I'd like to think I got a few licks in though.  I re-spawned to find they were also attacking a port nearby where I had an outpost, so now, with only the "basic cutter", I sneaked back into the port where my outpost was, loaded up a trading vessel with all of my crafted items and resources (more than enough to make another ship!) and sneaked out.  My enemies caught up with me but I was able to flee the battle in my trader and get back to my nation's capital with my treasures.

Review will be adapted during the game's EA development process\n\nSomeone still remembering the age-old title Age of Sail? I loved that title for it's atmosphere and approach to realistic sailing and shooting mechanics.\n\nIn many aspects, Naval Action seems to be a worthy successor.\n\nShip handling is difficult and demanding, but incredibly rewarding when you finally get the hang on it (I certainly have no arrived at that point. Still missing broadsides at point blank.) It feels very immersive, too.\n\nNow add a pinch of Pirates! to the lot and mix it with classical MMO features:\n\nNaval action circles around PvE and PvP (there is a PvE only server, too) sea battles in an open world sandbox (yes, that time of the year again).\nChoose a faction to side with and gain ranks and riches by doing missions, privateering, trading and, well: naval action. Grind your rank from petty midshipman all the way up to rear admiral while sailing the infamous caribbean waters.\n\nBe aware there is only a very, very basic and GODDAMMN ugly, but functional UI and port interface present at the moment (place holder)!\n\nThe AI is decent but not stunningly smart. It benefits from cheating and bonuses, too. Still lots of room for improvement here.\n\nAs to be expected you can find balancing issues, bugs and glitches but so far I did not discover a game-braking one. Remember: Early Access.\n\nIf you were disappointed by gamey ship handling in Empire: Total War but loved it's graphics and atmosphere, Naval Action will interest you. If you're willing to look beyond the Early Access issue and the heavy Elite:Dangerous style rank grind, which still feels dull and pretty unrewarding.\n\nIf you ever wanted to be Jack Aubrey, Mr. Hornblower, Arr! Blackbeard or Surcouf, this is your chance. Don't forget to have a looped volley of shanties running on your music player, though.\n\nThe Looks and Sounds\n\nSailing ships roll and pitch in the seas in all their detailed, glorious splendour. Mighty Ship-of-the-Lines exchanging rolling broadsides under a waning moon, their dim stern lanterns lit while the whole sea is enlightened by muzzle flahes just to be swallowed by dense gun powder clouds again.\n\nListening to the creaking sound of ships rolling in heavy waves and the impressive thunder of firing 32 pounders is impressive.\n\nAh, the ocean! It's colour sheme and rolling wave's look even more realistic and impressive than in World of Warships, and that ocean already looks stunning.\n\nSpotting a lone sail or traces of a slowly growing landmass on the fog-shaded horizon amidst the sheer endless, foaming sea really succeeded in immersing me right into the game.\n\nI've exclusively playing PvE until now- so I can't give a verdict about the PvP servers or the state of PvP in general.\n\nAs of update 9.7 there have been many additions to PvE content like gargantuan AI fleets, AI can sail all ship types, a stronger, very challenging AI opponent (as of update 9.73 made easier for lower skill levels), land-in battles (meaning the battle terrain will reflect the open world terrain).\n\nThe only thing that needs to be added for atmosphere are decent music (and by the way, those STUPID COMMENTS ON THE LOADING SCREENS NEED TO GO! They are not even close to be funny.) and more modelled sailors. Right now you've only got one sailor manning a gun each, the helm is unmanned and no one cares to deal with sails. Which looks kinda silly! Albeit the sailors models themselves are well done and the textures detailed.\n\nOn Crafting\n\nBuilding ships can be a pain. It all comes down to the hunt for blue prints enabling you to buildship type when consuming the blue print item.\nBlue prints do have a random drop chance while producing a certain ship type:\ne.g. building a St. Pavel 2nd Rate Ship-of-the-Line might give you a blue print drop for a 1st rate Victory.\n\nAs chance RNG is involved you may have to build several ships of a type to cimb up the blue print ladder. This can be frustrating. But as of patch 9.6 the chances for drops have been altered so there is a very decent drop chance by now. I have all the blueprints by now and don't even have the highest crafting rank- chances are influenced by your level relative to the BP level you are trying to get and the quality of the shiup you were building- the higher the better)\n\nCrafting is also affected by your crafting XP level. You get XP for building ships, modules, components and thus level up until you reach level 50 enabling you to build the mightiest 1st rates in exceptional quality and the best modules (that can be placed as ship components making them better), too.\n\nCrafting also requires ressources (surprise, isn't it? :P), which are consumed by producing ship parts. These parts are then used in the building process. Eg. Oak---> X planks--->X planks needed to build ship Y.\n\nFor the very crafting process you also consume labour hours that replenish over time. As they are also used for extracting ressources from production buildings, buildiong modules or components they are the rarest good. You'll have to be careful on what to spend them if you want to climb the XP ladder / built ships most effective. E.g. you'll have to amass the labour hours worth of two real life days to build a single Santissima Trinidad- without all the components needed!\n\n\nFeel free to ask me questions in-game, my Naval Action char is named "Agamemmnon" (sic! don't mind the stupid added "m", my apologies!, Admiral Nelson) mostly playing on PvE 1.","January 26","true","383.3"," 39 of 45 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","39","45","0","0"

When I bought it, you could only play something called Sea Trails, which was only combat and no open world. I got a bit tired of the wipes, so I didn't play that much. That didn’t mean I disliked it, though. Naval Action does in fact beat all the games I've played about warships from the age of sail. I think it beats Assassin's Creed: Black Flag and Pirates of the Caribbean Online by a long shot, even though I played the crap out of them. That was true even a year ago, when the ship vs. ship action wasn't as good as it is now and there was no open world.\n\nThe visuals are amazing, too. Stern lights and the day and night cycle gives a really good atmosphere. When in combat, the muzzle flashes of cannons going off as well as the gunpowder smoke looks better than in any other similar game.\nI have most graphic options on the lowest, but the game still looks amazing.\n\nNaval Action already have a lot of different vessels ranging from fast 8 cannon sail ships to giant first rate ships of the line with up to 138 cannons and three gun decks (four if you include the weather deck).\nIf you have played World of Warships, you will recognize certain elements when it comes to shooting. For instance, you can shoot individual shots to make sure the full broadside will hit. It is, however, more difficult and in my opinion better than in WoWs.\nWind is an important aspect in NA, as all ships are using sails. Tacking against the wind can be hard for newcomers, but there are good tutorials out there that cover this.\n\nOpen world is something I haven’t really played that much, but I do like it. You can choose between the British, French, Spanish, Swedish, Danish-Norwegian, Dutch, United States navies as well as Pirates. You become a Pirate automatically when attacking ships from your own navy. The whole crafting and trading system may seem a little overwhelming to some, but it is something that should be learnt quite easily. Off course, there are tutorials for that too.\nShips can be crafted, and players can set ships for sale at a price they choose themselves. You can, for example, sell a cutter (The first ship you get) for 100.000 gold, but nobody will buy it as they can get it for free in the store. Also, each ship have 5 durability, which means that if it sinks 5 times it is gone forever. You can buy repair kits, but in combat you can only use one. That means that you will often find yourself running away if you’ve ended up in a bad situation.\n\nApart from from the placeholder UI, the only thing I dislike about the game is that after you buy it, there’s no way to continue supporting it through the game itself.\nThe game is not for people who are just looking for a relaxed and forgiving MMO experience, but if you're interested in warship games I can almost guarantee that you'll like it.\nThere is more to this game than just what I've mentioned, and I might add to this review when I've played some more.\n\n10/10","January 21","true","92.3"," 79 of 112 people (71%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","71","79","112","2","0"

I can tell you the graphics are beautiful, the gameplay is really fun, the community is great, and this game really fills the huge empty gap that is currently missing for Open World Age of Sail games.\n\nThe OW is huge and It takes probably 20+ hours to sail across the Carribean in this game.  There is trading, crafting, ship building, port battles, storms, varying weather, day night cycle, several factions and free towns, realistic phyics, historical ships, large fleet battles, conquest mechanics...pretty much everything you would want in a realistic Age of Sail game.  For the combat, this game is more on the realism and hardcore, skill based side, easy to pick up hard to master, having to learn things like yard controls with tacking and boxhauling maneuvers.\n\nPlease note the devs have been rapidly releasing new features and there is not a lot of what I would call 'polish' to the game yet.  The UI is pretty barebones and some gameplay is not yet fully fleshed out.  The good news is their servers have been rock solid so far, no disconnects or anything.\n\nIf you are an avid PvPer you will love this game.  If you love large battles you will love this game.  Hell even if you only want PvE they got that covered too.  Buy this game as their won't see many like it in this genre.\n\nDefinitely a PotBS killer.\n","January 21","true","505.2"," 57 of 77 people (74%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","74","57","77","4","0"

You are able to rank up to command some of the biggest ships out there, like the 1st Rate HMS Victory, or build up your trading and crafting endeavours and rake in the big money.\n\nThere are a whole bunch of nations to choose from (United States, Denmark/Norway, Sweden, British Empire, France, Dutch Republic of the United Provinces, Spain and the outlaw Pirates), ranging in various difficulties depending on how many islands they start out with and their diplomatic capabilities. You can log onto a server (PvP or Player versus Player) where many of the ports can be conquered by other players of other nations and players of the different nations can fight it out in the Caribbean waters with each other as well, or you can choose to take it easy and sail around on the PvE (Player versus Environment) server where those things are disabled. Rank progression is shared among the two, money and assets aren't.\n\nEven at this early stage the tropical world you sail in looks gorgeous and the action when battling looks breathtaking. That being said, it's not a game for the people that are impatient and with a short attention span. If you intend on exploring the Caribbean you can easily spend 30 to 60 minutes sailing without anything in sight but open sea before reaching land again. But it's worth picking up for those who played Empire: Total War for the ships and possibly familiar with Pirates of the Burning Sea.\n\n[21/01/2016 Early Access Launch]\nMind you that this is a very early alpha build. There's no tutorial yet, neither any pointers, hints or tips, and UI is minimal yet functional and not all planned features are in the game yet. For the best experience it is recommended to find like-minded players through chat, on the forums or better yet join them on TeamSpeak. Many of the seasoned players, many who were able to play for more than a year, are more than happy to help answering all of your questions. If you want to play this rather for yourself on the PvE server, expect a steep learning curve.","January 21","true","635.3"," 56 of 76 people (74%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","74","56","76","2","6"

When I first started there was no open world, only a battle arena. This was fantastic because it allowed the developers to test combat mechanics. Since then, they've implimented the Open World, basic economy and crafting, a new damage model, and a ton of new ships.\n\nThe game is fairly niche, and it does have a steep learning curve when it comes to combat, but don't let that hold you back. The graphics are incredible, the sound effects are stunning, and the ships are majectic. The developers have been fantastic thus far; they have been very open to change and discussion, as well as listening to the opinions and suggestions of members of the community.\n\nNaval Action has been absolutely fantastic, and I have nothing but kind words to say about it. Now remember, it is an Early Access game, so there are bugs, and there are things that aren't as pretty or refined as they could be. There isn't an "Official" tutorial, but there are many fan made ones here: http://forum.game-labs.net/index.php?/forum/44-guides/  However, at the end of the day, I'd have to reccomend this game. The developers had put this release off for several months, because they wanted to make a good first impression. That alone, speaks a lot for the character of the developers. They're not in it for the early cash grab, but instead, they are devoted to making an incredible game.","January 21","true","547.7"," 62 of 88 people (70%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","70","62","88","2","1"

You spawn in your little dinghy at a port full of a bunch of other people in their little dinghies and one guy with a giant ♥♥♥ frigate showing off. This game doesn't have much curb appeal. You step in and it's clearly unpolished (as expected). The UI is bad and confusing, boarding ships is this minigame that people have described as "rock paper scissors" but really if you just always go offense you can't seem to lose, there are no tutorials or help in-game, and many items/descriptions are ambiguous like "Marines" give me "cannon_reload_time = 10%." What does that mean? Is my reload time going up or down? Or is it 10% of the original value? I also didn't figure out different wood types affect ship speed/health until about 15 hours in. That would be important. Also I didn't know that your rank affected how many crew you can have, not which ship you can buy. Would've been nice before buying a 200 crew ship so early on. I have encountered a few bugs, namely capturing ships and then not receiving them in the loot screen.\n\nStill, despite all these flaws, it is a damn fun game. Now that I've figured out how most of the mechanics work, there is a lot of depth to the overworld content as well as combat. The roar of cannons in the big 20+ ship battles is music to my ears, not to mention the game looking really good for an EA title. Also, the lag seems to be non-existant. I play on the EU PvP server since it's the most populated and don't notice any lag at 150ms nor have I seen anyone rubber-banding and such. Finally, the devs appear to be very responsive. They're active on Twitter answering questions and posting about updates as well as being very reactive to player feedback before the Steam launch went live.\n\nAll in all I give it a 8/10. The core mechanics are good fun and there's definitely enough content to keep you occupied. The devs have a solid base that's rough around the edges; once you get past the initial "wtf is this" from the UI and confusion, the game is really fun. Am I sure this game will move in the right direction? No. But from what I've seen the devs have a good head on their shoulders. Still, it's an EA title so take that with a grain of salt.","January 26","true","60.4"," 25 of 31 people (81%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","81","25","31","2","2"

Although still early in it's development, the game provides an immersive experiance that replicates the neccessity of quick thinking and adaptation to circumstance that pervades naval combat. The ocean is a 'living' being adding chaos to even the most well thought out and well timed turn to broadside the enemy. This chaos complements the commitment combat entails. This is not another simple a random number generator, HP driven fight with boats. This is more a physical recreation of a universe with accurately modelled physics. Combat is not resolved in seconds, nor even minutes. My first duel in the game lasted roughly 15 minutes, on the edge of my seat, hoping for some turn of advantage that would yield me the weather gage (naval advantage) and allow me to force victory.\n\nIf you want a deeper naval warfare simulation then get this.

The ship to ship combat is streamlined but deep. Requiring you to not only use the wind to your advantage, but also the waves of the ocean itself. You must navigate successfully, and command your crew to prioritize tasks onboard. All of this culiminating in an epic and tense battle, with the thunder of cannons and smoke filling the air.\n\nThe gameplay itself harkens back to Pirates! as well as elements that remind me of EVE (massive map, crafting and trading).\n\nPlayers choose a nation to start with, which will determine your starting location (U.S, U.K, Dutch, Sweden, Spain, Denmark & Pirates). Each nation has unique challenges based upon number of ports and geographical location. Interestingly enough I jumped on the French side, and lo-and-behold, most of the players were speaking French!\n\nOnce you start in your home port you can grab missions from the admiralty and head out to the open sea (which is an absolutely massive map of the Caribbean). Once in open sea you can engage battles that are under way, other players (if you're on a PvP server) or head towards your mission objectives.\n\nEventually you gain gold, experience and promotions. Allowing you to build, buy, or capture better ships.\n\nPRO:\n- Fantastic looking\n- Authentic Historical ships\n- Immersive weather and large map\n- Crafting (seems decent so far)\n- Tactically deep\n- Map does not show where you are, requiring you to use visual markers and a compass (I think this could be a PRO or CON)\n\nCON:\n- UI is a bit rough at the moment but is fairly functional\n- No tutorial on gunnery, crafting or trading\n- Somewhat steep learning curve\n- Map does not show where you are, requiring you to use visual markers and a compass (I think this could be a PRO or CON)\n\nAll in all, the UI is rough but the gameplay is solid. I was extremely skeptical of this title heading in, but after logging a few hours today I can safely say this game is already very fun and once it gets polished and more ships added in, it will be very very good.","January 21","true","21.8"," 21 of 27 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","21","27","0","0"

This game is very pretty, VERY pretty. So pretty in fact, I have to run it on all low graphic settings to squeak out 16 FPS. My gear is AMD 4300 quad core 3.8ghz 8GB RAM Radeon R7 250 w/2GB video RAM, it's not the fastest but I shouldn't have to ride the little bus just to run the game though. World of Tanks I run on high settings and get 25FPS and it's every bit as graphically intense. A minor quibble, let's get to other things.\n\nThe levelling system is a tad grindy, maybe not Korean MMO grind, but tedious enough that unless you're a fan it will take weeks of steady game play to get from the starting 7th rate ships to 5th (grinding all the way to 1st rate is for the no life crowd). The combat, while immersive, is using the same tired old tricks every dev uses to make the AI "difficult", in other words it cheats. Nobody uses anything other then Round Shot, and there's a reason why. I took a Privateer down to 47% Sails using Chain Shot (the preferred method of anti sail attack) and it continued to achive 10 knots, in close haul to the wind, This flys in the face of the Bernoulli effect on sails...with a dozen melon sized holes in them. The entire point of using Chain Shot is to reduce their use of anything but running with the wind and reduce their speed to a crawl, making them easy prey (a lot of ships during the period would strike their colors once their ability to maneuver was removed). I guess the devs decided that was either too hard to code (or maybe not 'sexy' enough) or ran out of funding when that part came up. By way of another players account of using Grape Shot (think big shot gun) to reduce a ship that started with 155 crew to 25 crew, and they were still able to maneuver the ship and reload and fire all canons as if nothing had changed. Yet again, another option removed for expediency of coding I suspect. I think they incude these ammunition types for historical accuracy street cred, but in reallity the AI doesn't pack it in until the hull is gone, and the only thing that does that is Round Shot. Remember, the whole reason to use Grape Shot is to remove the crew without damaging the ship to much, because then you now own a slightly used ship which is often times worth tens of times more then the cargo it's carrying.\n\nNow, lets get to the strategic map, shall we? For some reason, after months of Alpha and Beta testers complaining that open Faction enrollment was leading to grotesque Zerg factions skewing strategic game balance not one jot has been done to fix that. I get it, it's hard to tell people they can't play their favorite nationality in favor of sucking more EA sales and turn a blind eye to the steam roll that is happening with the ports, but the end game is not fun for anyone, even the umbrella factions as they will quickly run out of opponents. Soon, everyone is bored and quits to play something else. As the French I watched the Pirate faction in the USA PvP server take half of Martinique in 2 hours. After logging on before writting this they own most of the eastern French, Swedish and Dutch ports, the USA faction owns the coastline to Mississippi and a dozen ports encroaching on Cuba, Great Britain owns half of the Mexican ports, it's just kinda ugly. There's competitive and there's one sided, the abscence of any balancing makes for these weird one sided steam rolls. The thing is this has been covered by every MMO that's come before and failed to deal with the gorilla in the living room issue of faction balance, we know how it ends, writing your resume for the next game company.\n\nI cannot comment much on the Crafting or Trade aspect of the game, but port control is a huge facet of Trade, and the juggernaut steam roll of the ports has left many to give up on Trade if they aren't in the few zerg factions. Crafting requires for the most part a reliable resource influx, which is often tied to...wait for it...Trade. As you can imagine, quite a few have switched sides to the zerg faactions simply because that aspect of the game they like dictates they do so.\n\nWhat can I say, this game is still in Early Access so there's a possibilty these issues will be resolved before release, but don't bet on it until you see a video of some old Alpha dog telling you it's safe to go in the water again. I keep thinking, all they needed to do was pay some German board game designer 10-20 thousand Euro for consulting fees and implement his/her ideas regarding game balance, because those German board game designers know how to make a good playable fair game.","February 24","false","384.7"," 40 of 61 people (66%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","66","40","61","2","0"

But Naval Action, while still an Alpha, is shockingly playable for a game so early in its development.\n\nGame play is rather unique, and by unique I mean SLOW. Combat is slow, travel in the overworld is slow, crafting is slow, and that slowness is probably one of the greatest points of this game. If you are a fan of most modern games MMO or otherwise this slowness can be a schock. This is not Call Of Duty, or War Thunder. Naval Action is more a game of chess than a game of whack a mole. You plan your attack, you turn a few points off the wind and you wait for the enemy to roll into your broadside. A single ship to ship combat can take up to half an hour, a multi ship battle can take over an hour. Travel in the overworld takes planning and time, a trade route may take you hours of real time to travel. Nothing happens fast and in this quick twitch game heavy world the stately if slow action in Naval Action is a welcome change.\n\nFactions are a fact of life in Naval Action, there are no independent ships. You will have to join a faction in character creation but that does not mean Kill On Sight for every other faction; French Privateers will peacefully cruise past Spanish ships of the line in neutral waters, but you do need to watch your back. Just because you don’t attack does not mean you will not be attacked.\n\nOverall this is a pleasing game, but you do have to set some time aside to play a good session. I for one look forward to the further development of Naval Action, it has a lot of great potential.","April 28","true","143.2"," 19 of 25 people (76%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","76","19","25","0","0"

This community makes every effort to basically pvp via chat versus effectively PVPing in the game. If you dont do something somebody doesnt like then if you say anything "toxic" as defined by ♥♥♥♥ing nothing, then you will be banned. no refund, not any way to state your side of the case, nothing. BTW there is no chat filter, which i would be fine putting in, but there isnt. This in turn has fostered a community of the thinnest skinned, crying little kintergarden teachers that you can imagine.

This would be a great game if you got to actually fight somebody. The game has basically devolved down to playing fetch for an hour or better. The way the mechanics are currently you cant do anything, instead it takes upwards of 45 - 90 mins to actually chase down and sink somebody. Its basically boring as hell and unfortunately the only "exciting" combat is against NPCs which roll around the open seas like sea cows that never attrack any other player from another nation.

It's an EA game, that seems to have it's "goals" set a little low, and unwilling to improve it.\n\nThe ship combat is top notch. No doubt about that. They spent two years polishing the combat, and it shows. But, with a 10 man team, and 2 years to get this combat down, seems slow, even for just 10 guys. The ship models are sharp, great looking..BUT..The damage model is lacking. All you get is some torn sails, and holes in the hull that look like bulletshots in a wall on COD. No real destruction, no gaping holes, no little guys going flying(which isnt really needed), and the fire that can break out, looks dated at best. Sure, you have to aim your shots, and you have different "modes" of firing them. Plus if you want to maximize your turning, you have to manualy turn your sails. (There is an "auto skipper" that can do this, but it isnt going to work if you play any pvp).\n\nThere is a thread on the forums, on steam, where the Dev's "answer" some questions. And, most questions (granted some are a little ridiculous, but most questions seemed to ask about things that could only improve a MMO. And, the answers were; "Maybe, could, Dont know, and it's in there already"..Not what I would call answers to any of them. Yeah, some things may be out of reach for a small 10 man team. But, some things sould be very do-able, and were/are shot down, for "reasons". With a mini-game boarding action, and can't be bothered to give you any map tools (because it's "Hand Holding")I find that this game is going to be very over priced.\n\nIn my opinion, if you are going to make the "next" Pirates of the Burning Sea, but realistic. You need some MMO aspects that people can get behind. Not, just a great "feeling" in battle. If that was their main focus, they should have just kept their "Battle Arena" game they were working with, and left the MMO part to other games. It could have been a great 1700's "World of Sail", like World of Warships...And, left it at that.\n\nThis review may change later, if I can tell that they will get rid of this idea that making a game unnaturally difficult, in  disguise because they call it hand holding. (Which I feel like its more because it would be a pain in the ___ for a 10 man team) And, spend the time, or hire more Dev's to help, because it will be lacking a lot, if they don't. (It's not like they couldn't afford it with 40$ a pop)\n\nSo, the pvp/pve action battles: Id give a 8 out of 10\nthe trading(which they say they are working on, they probably are) 3 out of ten\nThings to make it feel like a MMO: 2 out of 10\n\nI would wait!","February 18","false","164.3"," 67 of 114 people (59%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","59","67","114","3","6"

I have been following this game ever since early 2014 and it's grown to a very enjoyable game.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: This game is not made for the impatient\nThe game requires atleast a decent interest in ship combat and sailing, you need to navigate yourself, the combat is made realistically. It is not an arcade, note that if you just want to kill, kill, kill this game won't be a good game for you.\n\nFirst of all, the graphics look fantastic. Probably the best looking game I've ever seen in the Unity engine. The Open world currently does look a little worse than the battles, but this is understandable for performance reasons. The game runs decently, haven't had any issues to achieve a solid 60FPS. Yet the dev's stated they would improve performance in the future so no worries about that.\n\nThe ships are beautiful and detailed, just look up the trincomalee in the game, and irl. It looks identical. Honestly amazing how detailed the ships have become. I hope to see more crew on deck in the future. More activites there would be nice.\n\nThe sound design is AMAZING, it sounds like you are actually in an 18th century sea battle, the smoke really adds to the battles aswell. Couldn't be more perfect.\n\nOverall the battles feel very complete already, it is the open world which does require a bit of work. Of course, the UI can be confusing at first, and it does not look the greatest. It is not the priority, and we understand this. The UI is something to improve on definitely. Another negative thing about the game is that there is currently no tutorial. So finding out what to do can be a bit tricky at first. So please use the help chat in game, someone almost instantly helps you on there.\n\nThe open world is a WIP and that is clearly visible, and this is most likely where the developers will focus on in Early Acces, so you will mostly see that progress.\n\nOverall, I bought the game on a Thursday and within a week I had played over 100 hours. A recommendation for sure, dedicated dev's, good communication with the community. Best Naval game out there right now!","January 21","true","706.4"," 20 of 31 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","20","31","0","0"

I liked the period, but was a bit sceptical, especially when combined with a paypal payment method and was just willing to try it.\n\nHow much was I mistaken. It is my most played game on steam right now. I did hunt AI ships alone. I did chase player ships off the perceived turf with a group. For a time I was the one of lucky few, who were able to build HMS Surprise. I did successfully trade iron, when there was almost none left in the whole carribean. I went to the edge of the world. I met people that were nice and crude, honorable and dishonorable, dauntless captains as well as cowards. Does this appeal to you? If yes, this game might be just for you.\n\nHOWEVER, you have to be willing to overlook some substantial flaws, at least for a time. Terrible UI. No help, if you don't search for it/ask. You have to be willing to accept behavioural standards of the community (courteous, gentlemenly). You have to be willing to learn. You have to be able to think of the battles as battles, not as the grind.\n\n2nd HOWEVER, you get an opportunity to participate in the development of the game you have been waiting for for the last 10-15 years, due to the great devs, who really listen. (I can pinpoint some features that are in the game to originate with specific players and specific posts on the forums).\n\nI will not tell you if the game is right for you.

By far and away the best sailing experience you will get out of a computer game. The finer parts of what the Devs have accomplished thus far would certainly be the optimization and multiplayer integration. Both of these two key features make the game a pleasure to play both alone and with others. The ship combat is amazing, firing a broadside into an enemy ship's hull is one of the most satisfying things in the game. The sound of the cannons is perfect and you can hear them roll out across the water like they should. The ships themselves are marvelous to look at and the scenery around them is wonderful. The only gripes I have with the game are the boarding experience is a bit lacking at the moment and the UI is underwhelming however the Devs have stated that it is only temporary. The game overall is wonderful to play and I would highly recommend the game if you are into the age of sail.","March 20","true","125.0"," 16 of 24 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","16","24","0","0"

I'd like to say that I could endorse this pretty looking game but I can't.\n\nThere are quite a few unsavory elements to the game. And here's a few.\n\n1. Unrealistic and overpowered AI.\n\nThe NPC ships in the game routinely break nearly EVERY sailing rule of physics in the book, maneuvering like hydrofoils even in a headwind. And if THAT isn't bad enough, their gunnery puts even present day warships with their guided missiles to shame with a near 90% hit rate even at extreme range with maybe 2 out of every 3 hits landing criticals. Also they seem to have a higher rate of fire than most players.\n\nThe devs DID recently reduce the AI accuracy on small ships such as cutters and brigs hoping that less experienced players won't notice that all frigates and SoTLs still have the "sniper elite" level AI and dance around like fairies.\n\n2. Toxic and hostile player community.\n\nThe game is supposed in alpha stage, which means that people playing the game are supposed to be providing feedback and making suggestions. However the player community will usually try to shout down player suggestions, throw insults and name-calling around, and attempt to derail the suggestion thread by leading it off topic into wild and immature tangents. They also seem to celebrate on the forums when frustrated players announce their intention to leave <like good riddance or don't let the door hit you in the *** on the way out, etc>.\n\n3. Devs alienate PvE and Independent players.\n\nWith only a single PvE server and no access to alt characters if you want to experience something new, for example playing another nation or just plain want to play a new character they give you only 2 options either completely delete your old character and make an entirely new one sacrificing all your gold, ships, crafting resources and all that even though you still retain both your rank and crafting xp or be forced onto a PvP server where only 3 of their 7 or 8 playable nations are even viable and where ganking and griefing runs rampant.\n\nThey claim that this is designed to prevent economic exploitation but that kind of exploitation already exists in the game in the form of the current guild activity.\n\n4. They are setting the stage for total disaster for the game economy and solo playability with their future economic goals.\n\nIn their most recent patch they did away with player ability to sail captured warships. Instead players now have to auto turn in warships they have captured in boarding combat over to their respective nation's admiralties for a tiny sum of gold and only allowing players to commandeer merchant ships. They also have future plans to completely do away with NPC resource vendors and allowing players to have the complete run of the economy. This action coupled with the canned ability to sail captured warships will inevitably open the door to massive overpricing of ships, and other items and make it impossible for any independent player to survive and be competitive.\n\nIt's like Pirates of the Burning Sea all over again.....Perhaps even worse.\n\nAt least portalus games has since begun to offer means of solo player survivability (if only to line their own pockets with real-world cash).\n\nWith this all said I can not in good conscience recommend this game to anyone.","May 10","false","253.7"," 33 of 56 people (59%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","59","33","56","4","1"

But Slow.\n\nI'm not opposed to a 'grind' in a MMO.  I like when games make you work for it, and you have something  to strive for.  This game does that well when it comes to ships, and levels.\n\nWhat I mean by slow, is the combat itself.  Sure you can destroy a small ship with a large ship with ease, but when it takes 20 minutes for a group of players to kill one large ship, it's just silly, and feels like a big waste of time.  The biggest pain point is that when you destroy a side of a ship, it WILL sink.  There is nothing they, or you can do about it.  You can slow the death by going into survival mode, but death is inevitable.  So my question is. WHY NOT JUST SINK ALREADY!\nYou cannot accelerate the sinking any faster.  If the armor is down on the ship, and you keep hitting the ship, it doesn't matter at all.  Just pound away for 3 minutes and the inevitable happens, or just turn sail and ride away and wait for it to sink.  JUST SINK, EXPLODE, DIE!\n\nThe combat is good.  High skill based shooting, and strategy.  I've been playing solo, so it's not been nearly as fun as it would be with friends, like most games.  I do see a lack of end game in the current state of the game.  You pretty much progress in ships and xp for it's own sake.  The only end game I see is either just disrupting other countries with groups of players killing them, or taking ports, which is difficult, but relatively boring.\n\nPlayers of POTBS or BBO will see a lot of resemblence in this game, although this game seems more shallow, with less to do.  The boarding function is clicking what you want to do, not actually doing it.  No 'adventure' type thing.  No land based gameplay at all. (granted that was pretty lame in POTBS but it did add depth. Land combat which was boarding combat, farming, gathering ect.)\n\nCommunity is solid enough.  Lots of questions get answered pretty quickly, and you will have LOTS of questions your first week.  I'd definitely reccommend it if you are playing with friends, and hopefully the devs will come out with some more engaging things in the future, rather than running boring/slow missions, and fighting fleets for the sake of fighting fleets.  PvP is good, and fun, but also rather meaningless unless you go out and hunt players which will not be worth any kind of reward for the most part.","February 4","true","22.4"," 25 of 41 people (61%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","61","25","41","4","1"

I've played this game before it was on Steam, for many hundreds of hours.\n\nThe game itself, is an open world game based in the Gulf of Mexico/Bahama's. East coast of America, Mexico, all the islands of the bahama's, and Jamaica, and East coast of South America.\n\nTravel:\n\nThe travel in this game does take awhile. It's a HUGE map, however you don't NEED to travel great distances if you don't want too either.\n\nImmersion and Combat:\n\nThe immersion in this game is very real, and realistic. Distance of the shot, the size of the cannon, the thickness and even type of wood the opponents ship is, the angle your ball hits, the velocity, all of this takes into account whether your ball penetrates, and even how it interacts INSIDE the opponents ship. That's right, a cannon ball can continue to bounce around a few times inside the ship, or blast out the opposite end.\n\nWaves and wind will affect your shot quite considerably in smaller vessels, and if you're fighting in a storm, your ship will bob left, right, up and down affecting your shot as well. Your cannon can only aim up, down, left and right to only a certain degree.\n\nYou can board and capture enemy vessels, sink them, break them down for component parts to make your own ship, or sell captured ships.\n\nPort Battles:\n\nPort Battles is also a thing, attacking enemy ports or defending your own, complete with defensive towers and the works. If the attacker is the victor, they take permenant control of that port, or at least until you capture it back.\n\nYour Choice:\nHow you play is entirely up to you, and what you do. You also do not have to "grind through the tiers". Small, medium, and large ships have vastly different play styles, and skills required to excel at them. If you find the the lower rate small ships suits your playstyle more, you can stay in them, and ignore the Man O Wars, and higher rate ships, and your fun will not be diminished at all.\n\n-----------\n\nThe video's for this game do it justice, and are not "enhanced" in anyway. You truly can, even from day 1 get into quite frightening battles, or you can go into the less populated area's, and be somewhat safe from attack.\n\nIf fighting isn't your thing, you can craft or trade as well. Finding a good market, and trade route can be extremely lucrative, and becoming a well known crafter can also be extremely lucrative as well, capable of making high end modules, or even first rate Man o Wars.\n\n----------\n\nIf you love open world games, love the time era this game is set in, and are genuinly interested in old ship combat, or simply trying to find a new game that that's both immersive, fun, and something you can easily play with friends. This is definetly a game worth getting.","January 21","true","164.6"," 18 of 28 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","18","28","0","0"

Man-o-Wars, Frigates, Brigs, and so on. Even named vessels are available, such as the Essex, the Constitution and the Victory.

The water looks spectacular, and thats a good thing for a ship game. The Ship models look outstanding as well. Then there is combat; when those cannons flash out in front of you and you lose all direction from the gun smoke rolling across the water, and as the cannons impact you can watch sails tatter and shrapnels of wood spray into the air. Just amazing.\n\nThe main practice of the game is warfare (both PvE and PvP), however there are rather good trading and crafting elements built into the game as well. A sort of... Elite Dangerous but with boats.\n\nI do recomend this game, however be warned, this game is a time sink. Even traveling around the map can take hours of sailing. A larger battle can also take upwards to an hour sometimes more, but this game is not boring even with the lengthy battles and travel times.\n\nOverall I look forward to what this game has to offer in the future as even in its current state it is very playable and Ive already sunk (<- ship pun) hours of time into it.","May 5","true","58.0"," 20 of 32 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","20","32","0","0"

I realize the price is steep for an early access game, but this is quite simply one of the most fun games I've probably ever played, both in the open world MMO genre and in general. I've easily gotten more enjoyment out of it than the last $30-$40 full release titles I've purchased, and the hours speak for themselves.\n\nThe Awesome:\n1. Combat is absolutely amazing. It plays somewhat like a chess match, in both large fleet actions and single ship actions. Each side makes a move, to which the other side attempts to counter. In a large battle, this mainly comes down to your side's shot caller attempting to give as many of his ships as possible a shot on the opposing fleet. In single ship fights, much of  the skill comes down to maneuvering to rake your opponent's stern to kill crew and dismount cannon until he can no longer fight, while preventing him from doing the same.  The combat is definitely the most polished part of the game, and it shows.\n\n2. Development: I say this mainly because the game already is in development, but I've seen very few games capable of treading the thin line between giving the players what they want, and doing what's best for the players and the game as a whole. These devs have done an amazing job on this, and many player suggestions throughout closed alpha and even early Steam release have found their way into the game. In addition, the development cycle is very regular, with a major content patch around the middle of each month, along with usually 2 ships added to the game. In addition, the devs have added multiple player-made ships to the game.\n\n3. The Open World map: This is probably the most important part of the game. The open world map is a scale representation of the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico, based off of maps from the time period of the game (early 1800s-late 1700s). This is how you get from port to port and find other players to sail or fight with. When engaging other players, your position relative to them and both of your positions in relation to the wind translates directly into the battle instance, making positioning in the OW almost as important as actual combat skill. A recent update now translates any land you may be nearby into the battle as well, meaning cunning captains can pin smaller and nimbler ships against land when they would otherwise be able to sail away unscathed. In addition to that, major fleet AI battles can be found quite easily in the open world as well (but make sure you bring friends).\n\nThe Not So Awesome (outdated, see EDIT):\n1. Finding a fight: One of the biggest complaints is the difficulty of finding a fight in the open world. This can be a challenge, but it does depend primarily on where you are trying to find fights. Generally, the closer to Cuba/Jamaica you are, the better the change of finding a fight (this primarily concerns the PVP1 server). Free Ports (uncapturable by any faction) allow you to base ships closer to these areas to get into the action quicker. In addition, duels can be set up in the port screen (just ask around in national or local chat for a dueling partner, and remember your ships must be the same battle rating to duel), which gives a loss-free way to practice handling your ship before jumping into real danger in the open world.\n\n2. Game Economy/Crafting: This is probably the least polished portion of the game, meaning everything I say here is subject to change. The economy is inbetween a full player driven economy and an AI driven economy. Money can be made quite easily by your production buildings, and those resources in turn supply the shipbuilders. Ships require resources to build if you want an above average one, otherwise basic versions with a minor flaw or minor improvement (to speed, crew space, rigging, etc.) can be bought for very affordable prices from the AI. AI only sells up to 4th rate 60 gun ships however, anything larger must be built by a crafter or captured from another player. If your objective in buying the game is to become a major crafter/trader and nothing else, you may want to wait for this feature to mature before purchasing.\n\n3. The "Grind": You'll find many reviews that complain about the game's grind. At the end of the day, the game is only a grind if you make it one. Unlike War Thunder, World of XXX, or other arena games where you are forced to play a vehicle  to unlock the next, the only limiting factor in Naval Action is the crew you can command. You start with 40, and this increases as you go through the ranks. You can still purchase any ship on the market if you have the money to do it, and some ships can be used without much downside with less than maximum crew due to crew management mechanics added to the battles shortly after steam release. In addition, the thresholds for how much experience (earned by damaging and sinking/capturing enemy ships in battle) is required for each rank was recently reduced by a large margin. All that being said, don't fall into the trap of thinking "bigger ship = better ship." The captain's skill ultimately decides the battle. Even a cutter (starter ship) can make the difference in an open world battle, and I know this from personal experience.\n\nEDIT FOR 9.8 PATCH:\nWith the 9.8 patch, finding a fight in OW is no longer an issue. Teleport timers have been completely removed when going from outpost to outport, allowing players to jump around the map to various hotspots as they please (so long as they have an outpost in the area). This makes it quicker and easier than ever to fight PVP.\n\nIn addition, ship durability/HP has been compressed, meaning there is no longer as much of a difference in the punishment each frigate can take compared to each other, or for how much each ship of the line can take compared to each other.\n\nAlso, many new upgrades were added to further allow players to customize their ships, as well as all the other awesome changes in the 9.8 patch notes.","May 13","true","672.6"," 20 of 32 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","20","32","0","0"

The map is stacked full of visitable ports/cities (as long as your nation has a hold of it).\n\nThe combat is in-depth and can be complex. That being said it can also be forgiving against the AI and the game developers allow you to have unlimited free repairs for the beginning ship which gives you the freedom to test your skills without punishing you.\n\nEverything from the winds direction, the waves & the caliber/type of your guns can affect the course of a battle significantly, which adds an unexpected element to the battles. Does your enemy have long range cannons or Carronandes? Are you Up wind or Down wind? Is there a storm at the moment, or is the ocean calm? This all adds a unique experience to each and every battle which personally, keeps me drawn in.\n\nPVP is awesomly fun, with both open world PVP or Small/Large battles you que up to and play in. They are generally 10v10 for small battles and 25v25 for large battles, which can get hectic but are always fun. Teamwork plays a major factor, shepherding ships across friendly broadsides, keeping the ship distracted while a friendly rakes their stern or even assisting in boarding by grape shotting the enemy ship (careful not to hit your friendlies).\n\nThe ship designs are wonderful, even though I would prefer to be able to see my crew during the open world sailing. Each ship has different characteristics, some being hulks with more guns or corvettes built for speed which allows the player to explore with their prefered traits.\n\nThe crafting system also allows players to construct and modify ships to add special abilities. For example, a Snow- typically a slower ship- can have upgraded rigging and be built out of a lighter wood, which will increase it's speed for a lack of armor.\n\nI would prefer if they added some in-game music from the era, but I usually just remedy that with some youtube of either the Assassins Creed Black Flag sea shanties or some classical music from Mount and Blade: Napoleonic Wars.\n\nThe community is wonderful and always ready to help, which is quite rare in my mind. It may be because the game has a bit of a learning curve that it deters people who would rather "troll" then play properly. Some people have been around for a long time, and some since the steam release and they integrated quite easily to form a very solid community that I am happy to be apart of.\n\nOverall I honestly suggest this game even though it's in early access. It is not one to miss if you are in love with the era or if you are naval fanatic like I am. If not and are hoping to dabble into the genre, this is a great start - the game is forgiving to new players & the community is willing to help teach you the basics.","February 5","true","146.8"," 13 of 19 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","13","19","0","0"

Maybe because it's early access, but to understand everything, you'll need to look up stuff on the game official forum or ask on the steam forum ( who has a very low population compared to the real forum tho ).\n\nThe game is very well made for an early access, I've owned this game since it's very very early access where you purchased it on their website and they sent keys by wave. There's a lot going on and the game mechanics are very good. But it's really ''realistic'', it's not an arcade kind of game like how you fight with ships in black flag, so if you're into that instead of something more up to par with real life standards, I'd recommend you skip this game.\n\nThe graphics are very good & I never had any lag ( playing this game on a 560M than on a 960 ), obviously there are some bugs, but it's pretty good looking so far.\n\nThe only thing that is a downer ( for me at least ), is the price tag, 55$ CAD is fairly expensive for an early access game, and I feel it may pose problems for future sales.","January 25","true","3.0"," 14 of 21 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","14","21","0","0"

I started a year ago in Sea Trials and recently came back to it while sparingly playing in between.\n\nIf you are a fan of simulation then you'll absolutely love the game due to the physics of sailing and combat. While the game isn't fully fleshed out in terms of "content" it makes up for it by the skill cap of fighting, for me at least. There is a great feeling once you understand the mechanics of sailing and put them into action. The game has an incredible open world at the time of review and it is ever changing as nations control and fight over territory.\n\nThe graphics are beautiful with small details like cabin lights at night reflecting off of the water, waves, and the horizon.\n\nWhether you are a sandbox enthusiast or you enjoy quick battles queue style (they have these too!)

They started with the very basics by first developing, fleshing out and testing the combat module years ago. It is clear that this is where Naval Action shines.\n\nIt's not a true simulator by any means, however, it takes whatever realism it can and molds it into a fantastic gameplay experience. Sailing mechanics such as manually controlling the yards is extremely fun and rewarding as your maneuvering the battlefield trying to line up a perfect broadside. Constantly keeping an eye on the direction of the wind, the angle of your yards, the angle and direction of your targets yards and ship. Outmaneuvering your opponent can be a truly rewarding experience and most definitely will help you in coming out on top and surviving a battle.\n\nThe 'overworld', or 'open world' part of Naval Action is very much so a work-in-progress. However, it shows us the potential of Naval Action as a large-scale war between multiple nations trying to outsmart eachother through stategical prowess and manipulating the political landscape. Naval Action has a long way to go but it has shown us that the concept works, beautifully so, and they plan to make it so much better.\n\nAlbeit a tad bit pricey for being an Early Access game, I personally believe it to be one of the best we've seen thus far. So if you like the Age of Sail in general, perhaps the masterpiece film 'Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World', the great series 'Black Flag', you might want to check out this game.","February 6","true","70.6"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","8","10","0","0"

The vast majority of the vocal players are "reality" obsessed,  they really belive that they are real sailors and they have no perspective on the fact that it is and being sold as a video game, not a simulator and thus they are obsessed with making the game as boring and unintuitive as possible in the name of being a "challange", from no world map to ai ships so few and far between that you spend most of your time sitting out to sea 1000 yards away from port waiting for enemy ships to appear and the devs answer to needing more ai ships is that the want to maintain a sense of realism and make it a "special experience" when you finally see a enemy ship, all this would be fine if you had somthing else to do to level up.

This, this is a really great find for fans of the era, or just looking for something different.\n\nSome things you must have a basic understanding of before you play.. or you will be really frustrated... You will / can learn but better to admit to yourself what level you are before rage quiting.. take that frustration and learn how.. its not so hard.\n\n1. Real compass to map navigation. There are no giant quest guides. No mini map route to use. You have a map. You have a compass. Terms like S by SE begin to come clear.  If your in the deep water, landmarks dont exist.  You have your compass, the sun and you have to think about how long you have been sailing and speed.\n\n2. Sails / tacking etc.. The physics are pretty good in what I have seen. Fortunately you do have wind direction available on your compass.. a little knowledge of sails goes a looooong way.  Also remember.. these vessels dont stop, accelerate or turn on a dime. It takes the crew a moment to make sail changes also.\n\nCombat is really well done. Cannons, various ammo types of the time, shipboard musket fire.. boarding..\n\nThe tide is with us, the wind fair, cast off!","April 1","true","63.2"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

I've enjoyed this game a lot through it's development and progress, however, you need to know about this game before you get into it.  Spend a week or two reading the fourms, watching videos on YouTube and such, and you should be well aware what this game is about before you perchase it.  Naval Action is a beautiful and entertaining game with a mostly decent community, therefore, you should want to know what you are getting into before getting it.\n\nThis game is not fully fleshed out yet, and many features are still yet to be developed, such as a port UI, official in-game diplomacy, proper economy, and provisions.  Development with the game is slow, and requries patience.\n\nThis review is not about the individual features of the game, but how this game is largerly operated by most of the community.\n\nNaval Action is an Open World Naval Combat game.  The game's era is between 1750 and 1820, therefore, this is not a galleon, sea-dogs and pirate game.  Instead, it is more of a game of national sepremacy from the Seven Years War to the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic era.  Right now, the map is the Carribean, Gulf of Mexico and lower seaboard of the American coastline,  but don't be dismayed, it's plenty big enough right now, as it will take hours to sail from one side of the map to the other.\n\nThis game is not a game where you can log in an expect a quick and decent battle however.  Battles themselves can take 30 minutes easily, and not to mention the amount of time looking for a target to attack.  If you want to play this game properly, you need to set aside an entire afternoon.\n\nMost of the real fun in this game are the large national fleets fighting for conquest.  These are largely operated by organizations, for example The Decatur Armada and Tattered Flags for the Americans, the Sea Lords Royal Navy for the British, Enfants du Roy for the French, and the Dutch Antillies Squadron for the Dutch (as well as many other groups, more information for them are on the Naval Action fourms).  Most of these organizations opperate off of a TeamSpeak 3 server to allow for communications.  Some are more strict than others, and is up to your prefernce.  These organizations however will try their best to help you through the ranks and teach you all the qualities of seamanship you need for Naval Action. The real excitement are the large ship battles that will occur as rival nations clash with each other on their borders in large battles for sepremacy in the Caribbean.\n\nBut yet again, people need to be aware that war is not fair.  If you sail away from areas protected by your nation, you are a free target for any other nation or player to attack you, fairly or not.\n\nThe fact is, the most important decision that you will ever have in this game is which faction you are going to pick at the very start.\n\nSome factions are easy due to the sheer number of players, like the British and the Pirates due to their sheer numbers, while others are thrown in the middle of the most contested waters in the game, such as the Danes, Swedes and the French.  Spain will forever be a target for the more expanively minded nations until they get a population, while the Americans and Dutch will be cursed in the early game due their lack of ports and resources.  Currently, there is not official diplomacy implemented between the nations and all are theoretically at war.  Diplomacy is largely crated by the player organizations.  For example, the Dutch and the Danish organizations are allied with each other, even though theoretically they are at war with each other in the game.  Therefore, it is wize to learn about which organizations are allied with which, and which ones are at war.\n\nIn conclusion, at the current state of the game, and particularly on the PvP server, the best way to treat this game is a battle for National Sepremacy.  Each nation has its own story: the Swedes, a story of survival; the Spanish, a story of prevervation; the Americans, a story of expansion; the British, a story of sepremacy; the Danes, a story of progress; the French, a story of unity; the Dutch, a story of achievement; and the Pirates, a story about too much rum and watching the world burn.  These nations may or may not achieve the stories the way that they wish, but they are the vital core of the game right now.  It is these nations and the people that follow them that make this game what it is.","January 21","true","044.5"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","0"

Down to Davy Jones’ locker you go!\nWell not most of the time……\n\nBased on the age of sail, wait, for those dimwits who can’t understand “age of sail”, that means your boat does not have a motor (NO ♥♥♥♥) it uses the wind for power. Boats at this time were made out of wood, so don’t expect to be driving the Bismarck around the Caribbean.\nEnough of the intro lets move on shall we?\n\nOpen World:\n\nReal life locations, beautiful sea, pirates, ports where you upgrade your ship or buy a new vessel, create a fleet (if you have the gold and experience), start battles, join your allies’ battle, attack merchant ships for expensive goods (my fav). Choose from a loads of nations: The British Empire (my fav XD), the French Empire (boooooo), the US (“damn colonial rebels” says in British accent), the Spanish Empire (filthy Spanish! I hate them…idk why but I do XD), the pirates (cowards and scum. I always go for theses ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s first). Plus a few more nations that I forget….sorry XD.\n\nNaval Combat:\n\nUse your brain and you will survive (hopefully). Don’t expect to start off with a first rate ship of the line with 108 guns (most powerful type of ship in the game). You, yes, you young captain you start off with a small 12 gun cutter. Sad and pitiful, you will work you way up to get better and bigger ships.\nCombat is fun and realistic. Cannons sounds like cannons do. Smoke textures aren’t bad would like to see something of a high resolution. Boats look beautiful. You can fire one cannon at a time or all of them (what we call a broadside). You can destroy the enemy’s sails, kill their crew members, or just batter the ships hull until she sinks (what I do most of the time). And there is also the option to flee……cowards use that tactic often. You’re not one of them are you? If you wanted to……you could always capture the ship! Sinking them is much more fun.\n\nOVERALL:\nIt’s a blast. Community isn’t fill with ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. Listen to pirates of the Caribbean theme with this game….will thank me later. Fought a brig in a cutter, lasted 5 mins 10/10 would get reckt again. Don’t do that plz. The devs still have lots to work on. Game needs better animation, cannons need to recoil, easier way to get to better ships. In the end the question you have to ask yourself is….would you to rule the Caribbean and slaughter the enemies of your empire through naval combat? Yes, Yes you would.\nIf you see me in game say hello and I hope, we conquer the Caribbean together! I always play as the British Empire, just letting all of you know. Good luck young captains!

Truly something different.\n\nOn the fence about getting this one seeing the high number of hours for many of the positive reviews. Took the plunge knowing I had 2 hours to decide before refund became unavailable. Glad I did. For the moment its like the old Pirates combined with World of Warships. Battles are just great, the detail level is a big step up from WOW, the battles are long and tense and swing back and forth as you land shots in the damaged areas and start to cause leaks below the waterline.\n\nUI - placeholder, does the job\nTutorial - non existant but plenty around in the community, and honestly its not that hard. WSAD to control your ship, your cannons shoot where the mouse aims give or take, you have to wait for the moments when you have a good line due to waves not being in the way. Community helpful so far in PvE server\nGrind - yes and no. Yes you have to fight a lot of fights to level up, XP rewards are proportional to the damage you do, and you need lots of slow earned XP - so you would be right in thinking that sounds like grind. Thing is that the battles are so good that I really don't get a sense of grind - this isnt right click on enemy, watch large hit point pool go down, use abilities etc etc, the battles are far better and give me a sense of both pleasure and achievement when I win through against the odds - more like Dark Souls, really skill based.\n\nSo I really like this. Its absolutely an alpha in early access with a long long way to go to be polished, but you play it to do the ship combat and that is simply the best I've seen. Really interested to see just how good this can get, its clear that it has taken big steps in the direction of being one of the great ship games, comparisons to EVE online frequent and deserved, and could easily go all the way.\n\nCertainly worth the price of admission if you liked Pirates! or similar and want something with a really detailed damage engine, and excellent core game mechanics.","January 25","true","185.2"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","0"

Waiting times to login. well yea thats going to happen as the game just hit early access via steam..\n\nAnd that all too important message of It is Early Access!\n\nRight then, I was lucky enough to be apart of the early stages of pre alpha testing 2 years ago, the advancement that has been made in that time has just been great, the damage model is fantastic and altho basic to most people the graphics are beautiful. Back when we first got to play on the open world, ports had barely any textures, islands were blurred but it still looks great (A semi comparison would be like legacy rust to current rust.)\n\nThere is so much more in the pipeline for this game and the devs have been fantastic. They listen and communicate with the tester and player base (Just go to the actual forums)\n\nThis is a more hardcore realism age of sail game rather than an arcade style boat shooter.\nThe learning curve can be quite steep for some but stick at it and there is the help chanel in chat for newbies to go nuts in.\n\nOnce you experience a propper fleet battle with teamwork, the sounds n the imagary is just fantastic.

By far the fastest and most effecient way to get into larger ships are to run "missions" which as of now consist entirely of go to X kill Y. PvP and open lobby style battles are great but bot and mission grinders are already showing up in these with much more capable ships and dominating.\n\nThe "Open World" map is extremely boring there is really not much going on. There is weather but it does not have any impact in the open world map. You basically stare at water for 15min-hours+ depending on how far you need to go aand with no map marker, you cant really even alt-tab. You may see some other faction and attempt to PvP them but the rewards for the missions are usually much higher and involve less risk.\n\nThe main problem is the by far best way to progress to competitive ships is the dullest part of the game. It involved sailing to a marker on the map which does not have a marker representing you so you have to navigate by feel. Then you fight one of 2/3 npc ships that spawn for that mission type. The AI does not present a real challenge but the battles still take between 10-40 minutes.\n\nPvE gameplay is not bad some people like that but it is really unpolished in this game. Grouping with friends significantly hurts progression. The AI is not the worst but not capable of presenting much of a challenge either. Its always the same battle this one ship easily but slowly win type gameplay.\n\nThe free Cutter/Yacht causes more problems as the ship is unlimited and free so the fastest way to progress if you cant stand grinding boring missions is joining the lobby battles and then charging in and just yolo doing the most damage you can, even ramming etc is a non issue since your ship is free and the faster you sink the faster you can get in a new battle. Using any ship that is not a significant upgrade from the cutter is a huge waste as they can be lost most people recommend using that the entire time untill you unlock the end-game ships of the line.\n\nIF they are able to change the focus of this sandbox ships game to PvP at least on the PvP server this could be a great game. They need to at least triple the exp gained in PvP small and large battle lobbies. They need to find a way to diversify the ships used beyond free ship/brig-snow/SoL, again by offering increased xp/gold for people not using a free ship.\n\nThis game does a bunch of things right but then puts the focus and highest rewards on the least polished and most dull part of the game.","January 24","false","81.5"," 63 of 119 people (53%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","53","63","119","2","0"

I mean not a single one, there's no help page. No tooltips. No explanation of what things on the Worlds Worst UI do. No explanation about settings and things you can toggle on your ship. If you want to find any of this out, you have to go dig around the game forums, and read explanations of things that are out of date or don't help at all.\n\nThe players in game don't really answer questions either. I've seen several lost new players asking questions, and being ignored by the veterans in the chat channels. The playerbase obviously isn't putting any effort into helping the new people get a grip on a complex game.\n\nThe progression is absolutely glacial. I've played for 8 hours now, and haven't even gotten halfway through the first captain level. Even the gameplay gets glacial, once your ship takes enough damage and your crew takes enough casualties (about 5 maybe, it's insane) everything takes longer to do. Guns reload so slow you could watch a youtube video in between shots. Don't get me wrong, I'm a fan of slower-paced games, and wouldn't like to see this game turn arcadey. But as it stands, the pacing is just painful.\n\nWhen it's on, it's on. It's great sailing into battle, broadsiding other ships. Until everything slows down. It looks like there's a lot of fun metagame in the faction conflict, but you're gonna spend ages grinding before you get out of your baby ship.\n\nWait until the developers get a clue before buying this. As it stands it's maybe worth $20, not the asking price.","January 22","false","98.4"," 266 of 513 people (52%) found this review helpful 19 people found this review funny","52","266","513","19","45"

I guess if you like EXTREMELY slow paced games with very little content then you'll love this game.  If you enjoy sailing around for hours on end with nothing much to look at, you'll love this game.  If you enjoy seeing a game that did almost zero research into historicaly based game play, you'll love this game.\n\nSo as you can tell I'm not to fond of this.  It does have potential, and yes they say it's in "Alpha", but from what I'm reading on the forums they may not be implementing some of the features this game needs to make it actually "fun".   Currently it's tedious and the grind is unreal.\n\nEven though during age of sailing they portray in this game had a lot of accurate ways to navigate the seas, this game has ZERO!  Yes, ZERO!  You have a compass that tells you direction.  You have no way to set compass headings from your map, your map has ZERO interraction with your compass.  You can't navigate by using the stars....no really, you can't!   This is a deal breaker for me, just lame.\n\nLong story short....avoid this game unless you like to sail around and look at subpar graphics and enjoy a long grinds to get marginal rewards and enjoy a mildly entertaining combat system.","February 18","false","83.8"," 19 of 34 people (56%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","56","19","34","2","0"

On top of that if you like combat games that can be played at any brain level - from simple automated sails with button smashing to the more intricate manual rigging taking advantage of winds and turn - then you must get this as well.\n\nThe entire caribbean sea is massive. And multiplayer. Link those two together and ... you get the point. Massive multiplayer.\n\nFrom simple beginnings up to a commodore standing atop your own ship of the line of battle, sail the world, battle rival nations, trade, join events with dozens of ships in battles that make Trafalgar look like a nice place to be when the shards of timber start flying.\n\nAlbeit the game is somewhat demanding on the hardware side any modern gaming rig can run it top options, so no worries there. On top of that the "lowest graphics" scum cannot exploit it as smoke, dusk, dawn, etc are as a problem to them as to the full graphics galore player. ( as opposite to games where downgrading graphics actually helps spotting...etc )\n\nAs a last statement, this development team was a great suprise in the workflow and testing process. They started the very basics working damage models to spectacular quality given the engine and only after that fundamental process did they go to the massive world testing.\n\nThat's where we are. One of the best games in decades.","January 21","true","312.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

You have to come to terms with the fact that this game is a marathon, not a sprint. If you are ok with investing time and effort into learning the machanics of sailing, gunnery, tacking and so on then there is nothing better out there currently. It's a realistic simulation and won't give you things like map markers, you have to navigate with your compass.\n\nKilling enemy ships takes a lot of skill and time but once you get good at you get this awesome feeling which only comes from knowing that you worked towards it and not just clicked your mouse at a reticule.\n\nYou will spend about 20 hours just learning the basics (preferably against the AI) and then buying a real ship which will be your gateway to the caribbean. Don't be intimidated by the learning curve though, there are a lot of helpful videos and many helpful people in-game as well.\n\nEven if you want to just relax after a long day at work, you can just hop into your little pile of oakwood, pick a heading and sail the high seas!","March 14","true","123.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

However, I seek to give an honest review that contains the good and the bad, so that people know what they are getting into, and whether the price tag is right for them.\n\nFeatures\nAuthentic Age of sail naval combat game that blends realism and gameplay for an enjoyable and unique experience.  Era of game:  mid 1700s to the 1820s.  It is not a sim.  It is not an arcade.  It is not fully realistic nor fully historical, but a blend of all these.\n\nAuthentic and Addicting Combat System\nNaval Action features one of the most beautiful and authentic Age of Sail combat systems to date.  Every cannonball, every wave, and many parts of the ships are all tracked to see where the ball hits.  Accuracy is not based upon rng or a magical skill number but actual gunnery, which is your own ability to judge the following three things:  the distance between you and the target, the characteristics of your smoothbore cannons, and the pitching and rolling of your ship through the waves.  I don’t know if this is well known or not, but I have hit the wheel of enemy ships and seen their ship go into “rudder shock,” which means they cannot turn.\n\nNo artifical skills\nThere are no skills to artificially train.  Instead of training skills at level up, you yourself have to get better at the game.  Whether it is knowing when, how and where to maneuver in battle, your ability to process the tactical situation, your own personal skill at gunnery, the way you position your ship while under cannon fire, or your ability to navigate the world, this game is all about how good you, your friends, and your enemies are. Your hand is not held by the game, but you will find the community is typically helpful if you have questions on how to do something.\n\nOpen World (OW)\nExplore a massive world that would take weeks to fully explore.  It is time compressed because otherwise it would take days of real time sailing just to go between ports, let alone the weeks needed to cross the Caribbean.  How it is right now, it takes 4-12+ hours of real time sailing to cross the map.  Travel can be long.  Local knowledge of the area, the channels, shallows, and hiding spots are all vital. However, at the moment, the islands can seem a little boring beyond the majestic views.  There is dynamic weather and you can get lost, especially in storms and heavy fog.  Venturing out of sight of land for the first time can be a little intimidating.\n\nMap\nThere is a very rough ingame map that shows the ports.  The devs plan to beautify the map once UI is decided upon.  There is no “You are Here” marker.  You will have to keep track of that yourself.  Navigation is a skill you will want to learn if you want to venture outside the Arena.  It is extremely daunting at first but easy to pick up.  Soon you will be pretty good at it.  The map lacks navigation tools.\n\nBattle Instances\nBecause every shot, every wave, and detailed parts of the ships are all tracked by the server, battles have to be instanced. Instances can have up to 50 ships, whether they are small cutters or ships of the line.  Shallows and land do not appear in battle yet but is planned.\n\nRealistic Sailing Model\nSailing in the battle instances is fairly realistic and authentic. To tack properly (turn through the wind), you have to learn manual sailing. Easy to pick up, fairly easy to master. It becomes second nature, like learning manual shift in vehicle.\n\nUI\nBattle Instance UI is pretty good in my opinion. I am a minimalist when it comes to UI. I don’t want all the extra crap blocking my view of the beautiful ships and environment. The Open World and Port UI are horrible (tech demo). I wish Game Labs would have spent a week polishing it a little before Early Access. The UI will be finished later. They don’t want to spend a lot of time working on something that will have to be redone in the future.\n\nEconomy and Crafting\nThe economy and crafting is basic, but every time I turn around, something new has been added and fleshed out. Don’t fall into the pitfall of buying crafting resources from NPC ports and selling them to NPCs. Sell to players or build your own stuff to sell. That is where the money is. Crafting and trading takes time, experience, and a lot of gold, but the payout is good.\n\nBoarding Combat\nThere are no avatars.  You cannot walk about your ship.  When you board the enemy, a tactical mini game appears.  Some people compare it to Rock Paper Scissors.  Some like it, some hate it, I think it is fine.  If this is a deal breaker, watch YouTube first before you buy.\n\nPVE\nThere is Player Vs Environment (AI).  The AI can be difficult at first, even very difficult.  But they soon become easy and boring once you get to know them.  There is a pve only server if you don't want to play against players.\n\nPVP\nThis is where the heart of the game is. Expect Ganks. Expect great 1v1 fights. Expect on-the-edge-of-your-seat group fights, where teamwork and skill is needed to clutch victory from defeat. This is the addicting part of the game.\n\nPort Battles:\nRight now port battles only consist of a few towers that you have to destroy along with any player defenders that show up. There is no land yet or proper forts, but these are being worked on.  A successful port assault will change the current owner to your nation.  Do not open player outposts in national ports except the capital city. All other national ports can be captured and you will lose access to anything in the port until it is recaptured. Port captures are way too frequent (negative).\n\nArena\nThere is an arena option available.Technically you never have to access the open world if you don't want to. Battle seems daunting at first, but in the Arena you can practice in a low stress environment with the free basic ships. Combat is easy to get the hang, very difficult to master.\n\nProgression\nYou start with a small cutter.You can progress to a ship of the line.The progression can be long.  Just pvp and have fun; no need to grind. You will get into the larger ships in due time and you will want to learn the game first. This game is all about the process.Forget the end game. If you get to the end game without learning the game you will cry when your extremely expensive ship ends up on the bottom of the ocean or in someone else’s dock. If you grind, it isnt any worse than WoWS.\n\nPrice\nThe price is expensive for an early access game. But in my opinion, it is very worth it. At almost 2000 hours, I have paid about 2 cents an hour to play Naval Action.\n\nStability\nEven though the game is Early Access, I haven't had any crashes in almost a year. It is very stable on my machine. There are annoying bugs from time to time and very rarely something is wrong with the server. Other people report crashes but those are usually people who don't meet the minimum requirements. People do report fps problems.

There is much work to be done on the game, so those who are easily annoyed should wait to purchase at the least. I have NOT had many crashes, but a few disabling bugs that are usually ratified by a restart/ log (can't enter port, Can't sell goods, etc). I have played just over 160hrs and feel I developed a good grasp on the game. And it definitely does not take long to get a bearing on your place in the world. Especially since they added a map. Before you had to look at a google map and figure out an approximate heading. Which wasn't always easy since many places have been renamed from what they once were.\n\nThere are many interesting aspects to the game that age of sail or naval fans will find enjoyable. While others might find it a pain.\n\nFor example, planning your route of travel is more than just saying you want to go from X to Y. You need to account for wind direction and how it will alter as you progress along your designated course. Traveling in this game is a LONG and grueling process. You will either love or hate it. A good captain will take advantage of favorable winds and timing of the change in wind direction to make the most out of their course. That said TACKING is extremely important, and the sooner you understand that the better. Going straight to your target location is not always the best or fastest choice. Depending on your sail configuration and wind conditions will determine if tracking is necessary or in many cases a necessity.\n\nAnother featureful aspect to the game, naval and age of sail fans alike will enjoy, is the angle of LIST or LISTING which ships employ in the game. You ship doesn't sit flat on the water, (at least in most every case), rather it will tilt to either port or starboard depending on the ship itself, water conditions, and wind. This really adds to the combat aspect of the game, making it challenging to place shots on the enemy. Captains need to learn how their individual ships preform and act accordingly to perform in battle. Using different sail positions or going to battle-sails are great aids. But it will come down to the ship (and upgrades in some cases) and how well the captain knows his ship.\n\nUltimately the game is still in its early stages and has a lot of work to be done, but don't let that shy you away. If you are a fan of naval era games or age of sail in particular you are doing yourself a great disservice not trying this game out.\nOh yeah, and if you set an enemy ship on fire……. Put as much distance between you and them. And thank me later ;).\n\nTL;DR: Fan of Age of Sail and not easily scared by semi-hardcore mechanics this game is for you. If not wait or simply do not purchase as this is not a game for the faint of heart or pew pew-sters.","January 21","true","189.7"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","6","9","0","0"

This is due to the fact that theyre not a finished product.\n\nNaval Action is one of those games that has the potential to be a true gem in the making:\n- The map is huge, and i really mean huge which gives that awesome feeling of truly sailing in the caribbean.\n- Lots of player factions, not just the classic 3-4, no 8 is the way to go.\n- combat is awesome, it is slow-paced but feels genuine in how the ships move and behave.\n\nSure, alot of things are still unfinished and placeholder, for instance the interface and the menus when in a harbor are just raw and unpolished, clunky and lacking. But im pretty sure those are items that are on the development agenda and bound to get the necessary attention in due time.\nFor now i feel that the developers are focusing on expanding the overall game, implementing a trading system (which i havent dabbled in and do not yet understand) and a crafting system (this looks pretty easy and straightforward and works well). Offering the playerbase more to do than just float around, do missions and attack other players.\nThis is a good choice, imo. Polishing can come later, give us a game first.\n\nAnd the game is there, free liberty to roam around with your teammates and hunt down lone traders or sailors that had the bad idea of going out on their own or without enough support.\n\nI have joined the United Provinces (Netherlands) on the EU1 server (which is the most populated one) and from what ive come to understand is that there are clans of 200+ members that already wage large-scale wars against other faction. Matter of fact, as im writing now, the French are making a move on the United Provinces along the eastern Venezuelan coast to go and capture some of the towns. Its all-out war!\n\nIts a true PvP-game which i think can only be compared a little to EvE in how large it is and how large battles can be. Im not 100% sure but i think a large battle can include up to 50 ships.\nThis might increase later, it might not.\n\nI think its an awesome game but it really is a WiP, one that even in its current state i highly enjoy and recommend!","February 2","true","75.6"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

It has some similarities to Pirates of the Burning Sea, but it is more complex, has way better graphics, and is way more realistic, at least in my opinion.\nStill, the game is in Early Access, so there's alot left to be done, as the UI for one, and I suspect there will be some sort of avatar part of the game as well.\n\nA few things bother me though, first of all there's no real difference between nationals and pirates, wich goes pretty much straight against what this game otherwise have in terms of realism, the second major thing is that it is very hard core, and is endorsed to be so by the vocal part of the community that are active on the forums.\n\nOverall I can say that the developers seem to listen very closely to what those active on the forums say, and not only ask for but also act on alot of the feedback they get. This however seem to further propel the hard core setup of the game, and I fear this can lead to a high degree of drop-outs among those trying this game out.\nThis doesn't seem to be viewed as a problem for most of the players, since there seem to be an opinion that it will create a good and healthy playerbase if "weak" players are weeded out.\nA good and healthy playerbase need enough players though, and I can see that might be a problem.\n\nStill, I recommend this game, it's very well made, the ship combat is good, and the graphics are beautiful, even damn beautiful.","January 31","true","325.3"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

Its a true blue sailing game that put its big boy pants on and actually made something that rides the balance between simulation and genuinely fun. The game itself is only partially fleshed out, and for whats there its already really awesome. The game has spent the past number of months in a closed alpha and the devs do seem to really care abou their game.\n\nThe game is not your "Assassin's Creed" style of naval combat. Its a bit more slow paced and 'realistic' to a degree. The game promises to be something really great, with a player based economy and polical system that has a very pleasant Eve Online flavor to it. The foundations of the open world are already in place with trading, raiding, and basic missions from the Admiralty in place.\n\nEach faction (The Royal Navy, The Spanish, The Dutch, The US, Sweden god help you if you go Sweden, Pirates, and Denmark) has its own semi historic territorial holdings in the Caribbean and so far the focus of the game is to expand your faction's port holdings.\n\nThe Devs promise chunky updates once a month from here on out and there will apparently be no more wipes.

Nowadays EA stands for Early Access but somehow there are those that expect an EA game to be feature complete(!?). For those that have been here since the devs first starting selling access keys and watched it grow from one PvE instance until now with Open World being just so incredibly huge this game has enough to justify the price for those who don't demand a $100mill game for their $40.\n\nUpsides;\nSlower paced game that simulates the forethought which went into sailing and fighting in Age of Sail ship. A much better "thinking man's shooter" than others in the store.\nNo crashes (using the x64 build) and only a couple of graphical glitches and minor, non-gameplay breaking bugs.\nVery good graphics. No, you can't disembark and walk around the port but that is a small nitpick that takes nothing away from the core game.\nDownsides;\nA slower game time-scale wise than many will be wanting to put up with - As one commented in chat the other day if you want to sail from one side of the map to the other plan on doing something other while your ship is sailing (studying, websurfing, etc). Not for the "I want it now, right now" crowd.\nSimple UI - This is one point that needs addressing soon. Something a bit more immersive such as the old "Pirates!" game would be nice but admittedly we still have many months to go before we can expect something of that scale to be implemented.\nA slow grind and even slower for those explorer and social gamers types. The first couple of ranks could be made a bit faster to rank up in. Me being an explorer type played 8+ hours yesterday and am still an Ensign. Those that learn how to make the most efficient use of their time will rank up faster tho' don't expect to rank up like you're playing WoW while wearing full heirloom gear.\nTL;DR\nA fun relaxing game that doesn't require the best hand-eye coordination but instead relies on speed management and positioning.

At first you'll sail around wondering why you spent $40 and what the hell there is to do... Do not be worried - NPC ships are everywhere. Ports are constantly being contested by opposing factions (again this will grow on new servers as the game sells). The game has an internal network of events - PLENTY to do - tons of ships to fight!\n\nLack of tutorials means deadicated learning through the community - join a clan if you can to be faster. Find the public teamspeak servers - read forums, look for help and you will find it.\n\nThe interplay of wind-based controls and line of sight cannon gunplay is an amazing mix for combat. It's realistic and very very strategic. Don't feel bad if you can't hit some ships with your cannons at first - moving speeds and shooting timing comes with practice. Once a bit more seasoned you can really hit hard in some of the bigger battles with a reletivly low level ship.\n\nLeveling seems intimidating but in actuallity it's very much like other MMOs, just multiplied down. 10 levels instead of 100, getting to level "2" will seem like forever - but in terms of time it's like going from level 1 to 10 or 20 in another MMO.","January 25","true","70.4"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","7","11","0","0"

There are pieces of it that are simply magical. There are others that are pretty rough.\n\nHard to judge a game in early alpha, but as of now, I can only give it a very tentative thumbs up.\n\nThe good:\n- As other have noted, the combat is incredible. If you have even the remotest interest in the Age of Sail, this is the combat sim for you. It is amazing. Combat is by far the best bit of this game, and may be worth the purchase price right there -- IF you are willing to stick with it. You really only begin to see the potential once you get out of the earliest levels and out of your default cutter.\n\n- The open world is beautiful to look at, and the ship models are gorgeous. They look and feel like I imagine frigates and ships of the line would have looked and felt at sea. Cannons roar, smoke billows. It’s jaw-droppingly realistic.\n\n- The PVP aspects are great, even for those who don’t like PVP generally (like me). This is a very slow game. It’s all about tactics, about limiting damage against and taking advantage of your enemy’s mistake. Fast twitch does nothing for you in this game, which is, frankly, awesome.\n\n- The new damage system is fantastic. It is physics-based, and takes into account range, size of cannon, the angle of your shot, the type of armor your enemy has, where on the hull or masts/sails it hits, etc. You can honestly snipe someone’s rudder, which is a very big deal. People are complaining about it now, but I think once it is tuned a little bit, people will come to love it.\n\n\nThe bad:\n- So far, 90 percent of the effort has been on combat and new ships. If you aren’t into combat, and PVP in particular, there isn’t much else going on here right now. Careerwise, it’s pretty much all about fighting. Trading is dull. Crafting is tedious. And this is coming from someone who has done a lot of both, a level 48 crafter.\n\n- The devs have done a lot to limit ganking, and I don’t think it’s anywhere near the problem others do. I’ve never minded an unfair fight if it’s fun. This is a game, after all. But others seem to get more worked up about it than I do.\n\n- The worst part I think is the lack of newbie zones, and instead the game relies on players for the most part to defend those areas. I stopped playing MMOs seriously a while back, so maybe this is a new trend -- that somehow players will balance the world out. It hasn't worked out that way, at least on PVP1. And I'm not sure that’s realistic in a game world. But as a new player you’ll be thrown right into the thick of it.\n\n- In fact, I can’t imagine what this game would be like to come to new. There isn’t, as others have noted, much in the way of instruction. No in-game tutorial (yet). No really safe place to practice and learn. And as noted already, if combat isn’t your thing, you’ll tire of this game quickly. There is a pure PVE server, but the AI combat isn’t anywhere near as fun as PVP.\n\n- The port battle system sucks, and needs a massive overhaul (which, allegedly, is coming). Currently, it leads to incredibly boring dynamics where a nearly indestructible fleet arrives because they had time to prepare, and defenders didn’t, and it’s over really before it starts.\n\n- Pirates are silly as currently implemented. The devs are trying to maintain some connection to historical accuracy, but as of now the game system, oddly, allows pirates to be the most powerful nation in the game -- on PVP1 that is. Pirates should operate solo or in small groups. They should have completely different reward dynamics such as disrupting trade, running contraband, etc. And privateers should be a career option. Pirates should be flat-out banned from owning anything bigger than a frigate -- nor should they want to. Seeing a fleet of 25 pirate Santisimas is just -- wrong.\n\nAll-in-all, this game is worth buying if you are a fan of Age of Sail. Even now, it’s well worth it. If you are not, or if you want to pursue a career other than one that is combat-oriented, I’d wait.","May 24","true","536.6"," 11 of 19 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","11","19","0","0"

The combat is excellent but the meat of the game is making money which is accomplished by trading which is done by an intuitive list of goods to buy and sell for various prices. All is well and good until you realize the time spent traveling between ports which takes FOREVER and then there's no guarantee you make any profit for the amount of effort and time involved. Most people will find this game frustrating and give up. I haven't quite given up but the game needs quite a bit of work so that normal people with jobs and families can get something out of this game without dedicating their lives to it.","February 24","false","159.0"," 13 of 23 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","13","23","0","0"

I loved POTBS. Thought it was a great game right up till they sold off.\nI was kind of excited to see this game. A friend was playing it and verry excited about it. I himed and hawed about getting into another navy game. So I decided to take the plunge, and now sorry I did. To be honest I cant say all things are bad. The sea graphics are exelent. The cannon fire and aiming great. The crafting system seams good too, I like the labour hour storage.\nNow over to the dislikes.\n1.  I am sure that in the 1700's they where using sextant. So why do I not know where I am in the game.\n2. Ship speed, Why am I going so slow in a small boat and turning like a barge. I do understand that a large ship going with the wind and all of it sale can over take a small ship. I do understand tacting the wind in a small boat. But when I get in a battle with a small boat against a big ship, skills in knowing this are of no use when my speed in manurving are nerfed. One like thought out of this they do have the dead spot, They should also have with it the ability to take the other ships wind that is running form you.\n3. Nice spread sheat for a port. Am I back in dos? I undrstand this is alpha and It will probally change. But with so much detail to the ships and the beautiful ocean., they could have sat down and done something better.\n4. Attacking ships as a team, I dont understand why I have to go out side the circle to enter the battle that I am trying to join with a team mate. If you are in a group you should be pulled in together.\n\nRight now I wouild give this game a 5/10, I will be watching and trying it after patches to look for improvements.  I am not going to recommend at this point just because of the price point.","May 7","false","39.6"," 19 of 35 people (54%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","54","19","35","0","4"

It's a slower paced game with moments of high drama. Players that enjoy games like Eve online, POTBS or Elite Dangerous would probably enjoy this.\n\nSailing the ships is a joy, the devs have really nailed that part of the game. It does take some practice to get any good at it especially the gunnery and manual sail control. You actually have to aim your shots here, there’s no tab target and use ability type stuff.\n\nThe graphics are really well done they can be taxing on some systems though and at this point the port UI still is unfinished.\n\nThe game world is large and as a result getting from A to B takes time. This gives you plenty of opportunity to chat with other players, plan you next crafting project or plot your next attacks. This may annoy players that expect things to be fast paced, others like me really enjoy a relaxing sail from island to island.\n\nThe game supports both PvE and PvP players with both types of servers available, the difference being you can’t attack other players in the open world on the PvE server.  PvP options include fighting on the open world, arena type battles and port battles for territory control.\n\nFor the less violent types there is crafting, trade and hunting NPC’s on the open world map. There’s also a rudimentary mission system, currently only simple kill NPC missions but they’re pretty challenging none the less.\n\nOne thing I must say is the game is very stable I've not had a single crash in 100 hours of play and the only bugs I've reported have been typos in the test. There’s still a lot of ideas and improvements to be added though so the next few months are going to be exciting.\n","January 21","true","695.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Many systems are missing, many are unrefined. It's fun but don't expect a full game yet!\n\nThis said, as a fan of C.S.Forester novels, I love this game. I have bought it on an impulse after playing Windward just to relax and boy, was it the right decision.\n\nCurrently what has received major focus is the naval combat (surprise!) - it feels good! While a bit overwhelming at the beginning and the interface not being in any way final, after spending a couple of hours and reading around (no manual, no tutorial yet but plenty of guides on the forum and youtube) I started enjoying myself immensely. I really believe the combat captures the right spirit of the era and to any sailing ship fun this will be a delight. After overcoming the initial part I realised I was craving for even more complex mechanics to tackle (and which are on the way).\n\nThe open world part certainly still needs work but the beginnings are all there. It is very rough on the edges but with time and feedback it can only improve, especially because the dev team actively listens to the players and tries to fix issues and rework system to make it the most fun possible.\n\nSo if you like naval combat and are not afraid of PVP (let's be honest, that's where the fun is)  then grab your portion of rum, hoist your sail and sail on towards adventures and glory!","March 9","true","84.1"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

In general I have been pleasantly surprised at the current quality of the game. I have logged 30 hours on this and game has never crashed on me or become unplayable. I have experienced the odd bug but the devs seem to work quickly to resolve them.\n\nThe game itself in its current state has plenty to do. The joy of sailing around an Open World Caribbean is there. You join a nation and are essentially at war with all other nations (attacking your own nation’s ships, unless they are carrying contraband, makes you a pirate for life). So whether it’s hunting down a trade ship or a frigate, there are enemies to fight, both PC and NPC. There are also Port Battles which can decide whether a port will change hands to another nation. These often become big organized PvP affairs.\n\nThe game was already populated by an active community before it came to Steam. There are active player groups with each nation. The website forum has  many threads on the full range of subjects that a new player will want to know. This is a good thing because the game currently lacks tutorials.\n\nRight now there are two sides to the game, combat (sailing around, accomplishing missions or fighting) and crafting/trade. You can craft basic goods and ship upgrades all the way up to crafting ships, which can then be used by you or put on sale in a specific port. You can also buy/sell goods in different ports.\n\nPlease note that in Naval Action, your XP rank limits how many sailors you can command but there is no limit on the ships you can buy. So you start off at 40 sailors (and a Cutter that needs 40 sailors to man it). Thus, even if you have the gold to buy it, you won't be able to man a frigate that require a crew of 200 or more, let alone a Ship-of-the-Line. An undermanned ship often performs poorly in every way. So resist that “buy” button, even when you have the gold to pick up a big warship. Make sure you can crew it (and outfit it with cannons/carronades, with you must buy separately).\n\nThe other thing that should be noted is time. It can take a while to sail around in the Open World, especially if the wind is not in your favor. Hitting the seas for a full 30 minutes or an hour is not unheard of if your destination is several ports away. The Open World also has no real navigation tools. From your starting point you really have to look at the map (M), decide on a bearing and sail in the direction you want to go. Once land disappears you don’t know where you are, its pure guesswork and planning. Just sailing off without paying attention to the compass can get you lost. Note that behind the chat window in the upper left hand corner of the screen in Open World Sailing there is another panel that gives you some options, including allowing you to teleport back to the nation’s capital port.\n\nFor faster play, there are missions that typically allow you to jump into combat fairly quickly, from a load screen for a simple PvP match, or a mission that sends you to a spot in the Open Worlds near your current port to do battle. These two mechanisms are often the best way to grind up gold/XP but are also the most convenient for players with limited gamer time.\n\nExpect a slight learning curve because of the lack of tutorials and a sometimes not-so-intuitive UI in a few places. I spent a lot of time combing through the forums on Naval Action’s website for the answers to various questions the first week I started playing. I highly recommend spending a lot of time in the starting Cutter (it's free and replacing it is free) to get acclimated to the game.\n\nIn general, if you enjoy Age-of-Sail, you'll enjoy this game, even in its current Early Access incarnation.\n","January 21","true","120.4"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

The ships are from the age of sail. At the moment this review was written there are no other games like this.\nYou play as a captain, sailing a ship along one of several nations including GB, Swedish, US, French, Spain, Danish and even pirates. As a nation you need to stick together, to gain more exp and defeat your ports against the hostile nations.\nYea thats right, you need to defend your ports. As the game is pvp based all the ports of a nation can be obtained by hostile nations, what leads to huge port battles that gain you extra exp aswell.\nThe fight-system is instance based. So you sail along the openworld map located in america and join battles with your friends or start a battle against an enemy ship you see on the water. The huge maps and hundreds of ports make it even very interesting for players just wanting to explore everything and look at the beautiful graphics. As you fight enemy ships (PVP or PVE) and do quests you will rise in rank. This allows you to hire more crew members needed to control large ships. The ships itself can be upgraded and sticked with different cannon types, for example short range carronades that give u a lot of damage but won't work if another player just destroyes you from range with his long cannons. This gives the game a nice tactical touch, especially when participating in big PVP battles (like 40 players for example).\n\nFeatures:\n- Nation based gameplay to garanty PVP (PVE Server is availible aswell if you dont like PVP)\n- Port battles (obtain the enemy port and use it as your new headquarter!)\n- Crafting System (for ships, upgrades and cannons. To get the best stuff, you need to craft it)\n- Trading System (ports produce ressources needed for crafting, but not every port produces the stuff you need)\n- Open-World\n- Instance based battles\n- Boarding-Feature (You can capture enemy ships and its holding)\n- Different ammunition types for tactical use (demasting, kill crew, destroy ships)\n- Different Upgrades and Cannontypes (make your ship suit your playstyle!)\n\n\nI totally recommend this game and are looking forward for new players joining our current playerbase. At the end of the alpha testing we are around 500-1000 players already.\nPlease be aware that the game is still in early access. Thats why there is no "nice" User-Interface in the ports implemented yet. But the fightsystem and graphics on water are absolutly fantastic.\nSee you on the map, captain!","January 22","true","170.5"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","4"

It beats such giants as Age of Sail, Pirates of the Burning Seas or Sea Dogs. You control every individual gun if you want to, you can control individual masts to turn faster or decide at what angle/distance the guns will converge. Ships react realistically to wind or gunfire damage, they can even be set on fire. This game offers slowpaced but hugely realistic and fun fights where a small cutter can outmaneuvre anyone, a swift frigate is the jack of all trades and a huge, slowturning ship of the line should better stick to a strict line of friends to survive.\n\n-It's a true MMO sandbox. The downside: there is no tutorial, you have to rely for forums and youtube for (good) explanations, there is nothing resembling a "story" and leveling up takes a lot of time. The upside however: It's an enormous open world where you can sail anywhere and it will take you more than 5 hours to cross from east to west and you will have to use only your compass without relying on an automap. It's a world of thousands of players, if you play on a PvP server you can be part of high politics made by the mighty guilds/fleets, conquer ports for ressources, try to starve your enemy out or make your nation the ultimate underdog, biting the large empire in sensitive spots. While the main part of progression is nearly exclusively combat at the moment (it will change in the future), traders and especially crafters play a huge role in supplying this war effort, where large crafting chains of coordinated players are usually coming together to build huge ships of the line.\n\nImportant Disclaimer: You can play this game as a casual pretty well, however a game session of 15-20mins will not bring you anywhere since travel times are longs and fights might lasts for some time. However if you can spend an hour a day on this game and are an avid age of sails fan it will not disappoint you.\n","January 21","true","036.7"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

It is not a bad thing and the game is very enjoyable, but if you expect a great story or trading simulator will be dissapointed at the current stage. The main part right now are battles, basically standart open world battles against whatever you encounter on your journey and different forms of large PvP battles. While many other features, like trading and crafting, are still in development with only a basic version in the current implemented into the game so far. These will be extendet inn future updates.\n\nI am playing this game since the Sea Trials and still really like.

Por esto tiene aún muchos fallos. Personalmente creo que será divertido, aunque requiere muchas horas para aprender y ver todo su potencial, y para disfrutar con las batallas. Esto es de lo mejor: las batallas grandes que realizarás con otros jugadores, conectado a un Clan por un sistema de chat. Al juego todavía le falta la interfaz y muchos detalles que le darían más realismo, algunas animaciones, graficos, detalles de ambiente, etc. Pero creo que todo esto lo lograran con el tiempo. Lo peor, y creo que no podrán arreglar, es la falta de secuencia historica. No hay Campaña, ni hechos historicos, ni barcos españoles, ni nada que se le parezca, ni tan siquiera sabes el año en que juegas...y el mapa no refleja el Caribe Español en el siglo 18. Es una pena pero la Historia se la han saltado y, pisoteado diría yo, pues NO hay indicios de que lo vayan arreglar, y si parece estar hecho para agradar a los Americanos. Por esto actualmente lo que hay es un agravio y una falta de respeto por la historia. Ni los piratas eran así, ni las ciudades del caribe, ni la historia inexistente en el juego.Una lástima. desde luego no es un juego educativo desde el punto de vista historico. Grave error.\n\n______________________________________________________________________\n\nIt is a game unfinished. So it has many lacks. Personally I think it will be fun, but requires many hours to learn navigation and to enjoy the battles. Those battles are the best: you will play with other players, all connected into the Clan with a chat system. The game still lacks the interface and many enviroment details that would give more realism,( some animations, graphics, details, crew etc.) But I think that all will come on release time. The worst, and I think we can not fix it, is the lack of historical sequence. There is Not Campaign mode, neither historical facts, nor Spanish ships, or anything like that, not even know the year in which you are playing ... and the map does not reflect the Spanish Caribbean in the 18th century. It is a pity but they will have jumped the history, and there is no indication that it will fix. This game seems to be made to please the Americans. Currently there is a lack of respect for history. Neither the pirates were so stronger, nor the cities of the Caribbean, were like we saw in the game.Certainly it is not an educational game from the historical point of view.

After I got it in closed alpha in the first 48 hours after installing it I had 27 hours played. Its so good.\nIt is alpha, so game mechanics will change, appear and dissapear. The devs themselves promise new and exciting bugs with every patch. Keep this in mind.\nApart from that, its great. Good god its great.\nCurrently there is no official tutorial or manual, the game changes too much to make one now. But, you can find plenty of help in the aptly named "help" chat in game. There is plenty of guides on the forums and several youtube videos.\n","January 22","true","477.5"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","0"

I'd compare it to a sailing version of EvE.

If you do like mount & Blade mechanics and its map style, there is a high chance you will like this game.\n\nIt was a disappointment for me, mainly due to combat system. The battles are not shared on world map; instead, it will "teleport" you to a battle shard, and the encounter will take place there. I personally think, such mechanics, does destroys the tactical immersion; taking away a bust ammount of possibilities and gameplay.\n\nBut nothing can be compared with the toxic community.

The devs have a fantastic setup for the future of this game and will surely make a game that will go down in history. But as of right now, there is just too many flaws that make me rage quit this game every time I try and get into it. I'll list some of my complaints below. Keep in mind that I have been playing this game quite a bit to try and see if maybe I am doing something wrong, but I am convinced that this game has too many issues for me personally.\n\n1. There is no tutorial at all.\nThis game has a very very steep learning curve, almost like hopping into IL-2 1946 on max realism for your first time. You are dropped into the game and are on your own immediately. They don't even tell you how to open your sails to move. You are forced to get in touch with a clan who can train you and provide you with some basic knowledge about how to even use the port menus. Joining a clan isn't too bad of an idea since almost all of the larger clans are happy to help but if you like to be a lone wolf it can be very frustrating.\n\n2. The AI is extremely overpowered if you try to battle by yourself.\nThis is perhaps my biggest pet peeve about this game. If you are by yourself trying to do a mission on your level it is nearly impossible to sink the AI. I did a battle in which I was in a Navy Brig, the AI was in a regular Brig. I had 37 leaks on his ship and he was at near zero armor. He was still floating like nothing happened. He could even sail into the wind at 8 - 10 knots while the second I turned into the wind, I came to a dead stop. I was at around quarter armor all around and had 0 leaks and I was taking on water at crazy rates after one broadside. I have never been able to take on an AI in battle unless I had a fleet with me or took on a low level mission while using a large ship. The AI seems to be way too accurate, way too maneuverable, and have armor that seems like it's made out of cast iron.\n\n3. The optimization is absolutely terrible.\nNot much really to be said on this subject. The game has pretty bad optimization.\n\n4. The game is extremely grindy for XP\nIf you want to level up within a day you have to get used to doing back to back missions. It's not bad at first but once you reach level 4 or 5, it takes forever to level up. If you want to get this to play for only a couple hours a day, you might want to get used to the cutter because it will take you weeks to level up. While this can be a con, it is also understandable since you don't want everyone rolling around in the best ship.\n\nI have many more complaints, but I am really not trying to go on a b*tch fest here. I'm just trying to say what I don't like about this game. I will probably continue to try and like this game but as I said before, unless you are constantly with a couple of people to help you in battle, it is near impossible to win fights unless you go against a small ship. For $40 I would personally say wait until this goes on sale for at the most $25 and pick it up then if you really want it.","May 3","false","53.6"," 25 of 48 people (52%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","52","25","48","2","4"

The combat similation is absolutely top notch for an Age of Sail game, and certainly many players who have been looking for a similar title to Pirates of the Burning Sea will find a new home here.\n\nAs I write this the game is pretty barebones apart from the combat areas, but entirely functional, and stunningly beautiful. Combat is simply sublime. The developers are active on their forums and take their heading from the community as to what the focus of the upcoming patches should be. New ships to be included are submitted and voted on by the community and are then pushed through to development.\n\nI really, honestly, don't have any major complaints to make about the game in its present state, I think the only thing major that needs to be addressed is the inclusion of some form of tutorial, as you do see in the in-game help channel a lot of new players a little confused about the same topics over and over again. Thankfully however the community is both welcoming and helpful, and seem entirely happy to patiently help you as you take your first steps (and mis-steps!) in the in-game world. The Basic Cutter starter ship is free anyway, and losses are to be expected as you learn the ropes! Its a fun process anyway, and rewarding when you get to grips with it.\n\nI find the the game has a certain feeling of satisfaction to it when you win a fight that you should otherwise, by rights have lost, only to prevail due to your skill at handling your ship. In that regard, it is definately a rewarding game.\n\nLiterally cannot tear myself away from it right now, its very good.","March 4","true","395.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I would Recomend this game if you are a Fan of open World and Real life Battle tatics. The map is huge and it's like Eve Online with the Whole fly through space and Get to another star system but your in a Ship and you can't warp you need to sail. I like it.

The (few) naval battles games that exist can't get close to the gameplay, realism and beauty of this game.\n- Combat is really well done. Every tactical option is here : 3 different ammunitions, crew management, advanced sails management with wind direction, different kind of canons, different kind of ships and possible strategies...\n- Very enjoyable with a group of friends, large or small. As it is a PVP designed game, you'll enjoy the thrill of naval action together. If you don't have a group though.... you'll get ganked !\n- A very large map. It easily takes half a day of sailing to get through one point to another !\n- Devs are very engaged on this game, and close to the community. They often reply on the official forums. Tired of AAA game devs ? Here they're really awesome.\n- Port battles are going to be awesome once they'll release... forts. But from the previews it'll be epic !\n- No subscription, no cash shop ! It's basically a MMO like the first guild wars, Buy to Play. Price is OK for the content.\n\n\nNegatives\n\n- Open sea mechanics are still new, and not very well designed. Trouble to find enemies that don't run, trouble to find missions... ports are conquered way too easily etc... That will change but the actual state of the open world is bad.\n- Grind is real. I didn't grind much, as I like to experience quite a lot of different things in the game, and after 350 hours I'd have thought to have end-game ships. Not really ! I am yet to unlock constitution and 3rd rates. So brace yourselve if you're a casual player that don't like grinding, you might never experience the end game anytime soon.\n- The game is a sandbox, and is definitely unbalanced on small servers. Choose your faction wisely if you don't like to fight with unfair (impossible) odds.\n- Crafting system is terrible as it is purely based on RNG, but hopefully it will change next patch.\n- UI is awful, as it is a placeorder. This will change before release.\n- Customisation is missing : no character or portrait, no ship cosmetic customisation. But that will likely change before release.\n- You keep combat XP forever, but devs will maybe/probably reset everything else before release. You've been warned. Nothing is final yet.\n\nOverall : 7/10 if you have a group of friends or meet nice players in game. If you are also a fan about ships of the golden age of sail it gets to  9/10, THIS GAME IS FOR YOU. If you're a casual solo player : 4/10. Unless you want to play in group on a regular basis, this game has not much to offer to you.\n\n\nFinal verdict : Recommended\n\nThe game is unique in its genre and should definitely be in your library if you like simulation of early 19th century sea battles. I repeat, this is not an arcade games and it is realistic to a certain extent, while not being a full simulation. The pace is slow, but needs skills.  If you like or don't mind simulation-paced games, then consider the followings :\n\nThe open sea mechanics are bad, but the excellent combat mechanics more than make up for it. Open world is still recent though, and the game will only get better until release. Devs seem to be very engaged at keeping work on this game, and don't really care about money.\nAlso, this is a PVP game before everything, and to enjoy it you need to group and grind at least a little. If you don't mind both of these requirements, then it is definitely a good game. It is still far from being perfect, but worth it even right now. Then, if you're a fan about naval battles don't hesitate. You'll probably love the game.\n\nIf the devs fix the open world mechanics and keep putting more content, I'd recommend it even for casual players.","March 7","true","498.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Well, it´s in EA obviously but the devs are pretty active and also very communicative, have frequent polls for new features/ development steps and so on going, so i´m not worried the game will grow to maturity...\n\nThat being said, for me as a PvE player there is not (yet) very much to do, going on missions or hunting ships on the open sea are the activities that i can do so far, but tbh, that´s exactly what i bought the game for. More PvE stuff is to come,like more mission types and other activities. Right now the production focus lied (and probably still lies) on the combat (pve and pvp) mechanics as well as economy/ trading and crafting, the latter being really complex already. So if you are a designated crafter, you´ll feel at home here as well...\n\nthe combat and sailing mechanics are what the game shines at. It takes a rather realistic approach. It features a manual aim system, where each gun type and also each ship has a certain way to aim...combined with the need to take your ships stability and the conditions of the sea into account, aiming takes a bit of practice. Each single cannon ball seems to be tracked, means not only it "hits the hitbox,applies damage and that´s it",but it might hit, penetrate the hull, run halfway thru the ship, kill some crew on its way to the magazine... you get it... or it might just bounce off and drop into the water...of course there are also chain shots for destroying the sails,as well as grapes, especially to decimate the crew of an enemy vessel, available... what ever suits your needs :)\n\nthe gameplay/ combat is very slow paced and has a most realistic age of sail feel to it, so if you are looking for a quick combat game,where you jump into a match and 5 minutes later leave again with 20 kills on your count, this is NOT your game...\n\nif you´re the type of guy who throws a party when you land a beautyful broadside barrage after outmaneuvering that large vessel over there, then yes, this is for you :) while we´re at cannon barrages: the sound of a 20 cannon volley alone is worth 100$ :D\n\nSo yea... the game is far from feature complete, especially PvE players feel the lack of content pretty quick, pvp players who have no issues with finding a guild might have an advantage for now :)\nBut that´ll change, since they have PvE servers as well as pure pvp servers, the devs are showing the same interest in both parts of the game... But as i said at the beginning, i´m here for the ship fights anyway, and those are unmatched by any multiplayer game i have played so far...\n\nbtw, the recently added open world is H U G E ... a trip from southern cuba up to Cape Canaveral (Florida) took me almost 2 hours :)\n\nThere are several playable nations (including Pirates, which might change,meaning them being handled differently in the future...for now they´re "just" a nation as the others), which -on pvp servers- fight for the control over the MANY dozens of towns all around the caribean sea... but as mentioned, i´m a PvE player, so i´ll leave the PvP review to others...","April 1","true","354.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

While I was not very active on the forums I played often and experienced the progression of the game and how active the developers and community were. While it may not be "action packed" compared to titles like world of warships, or navy field, or other titles of that genre, it is however special in its own right. Truthfully it's a sin to compare it to such games as this belongs more closely to age of sail games like potbs. The gameplay remains some what unique, mainly in it being the only age of sail game I know of with very modern engines and graphics as well as modern approaches on simulating movement. The shooting mechanics are pretty sound with every common approach supported. The damage mechanics seem spot with the ability to damage most main components. Similar to real life its much easier to kill the crew than the ship, wood ships killed men, modern metal ships killed ships. You can use Chain shot and destroy the rigging and even take down ships masts, leaving them stranded in the water. You can use Grape shot to kill crewmen, though its less effective when you haven't weakened their armor by using either regular ball or double shot. which is your traditional cannon ball, or a double weight / two cannon ball load. All of the types of ammo are properly displayed visually when shot, unlike some other titles. I rather enjoy seeing the chain shot spin through the air and rip through multiple masts. Especially when you have a 100 gun broadside and in a single pass criple a small pirate ship. The boarding action is fairly predictable when against the AI, however it does its job for now. The sailing physics, while slightly speeded up and simplified is still a bit of a challenge sometimes, but im glad it is otherwise sea battles might take too long to be enjoyed. The open world map at the last quote was 16 million sq km, and it took three hours to sail from the US spawn to Spanish shipping routes near florida. This is much faster than real life though still takes a bit of time. There is the ability to teleport to your home base every four hours though. I love the scale of the game because it allows pirates to actually work, and allows the game to hopefully not get too crowded with time. The progression through the ranks is still in the works appearently, with some exp values still being tweaked but seems not too fast or slow so far for me. Also anyone looking into the game, know that Fridays/weekends is big trafalgar battle time now, that means gigantic battles of epic propertions with every ship from sloop to first rate ships included. That is more than enough reason to buy it because I will never forget managing to steal a first rate with my 40 crewmen sloop one game because people forgot about me and my team mates grapeshotted and boarded the ship without taking it themselves.\n\nBuy this game if your looking for\n-semi slow paced\n-beautiful everything wow\n-regularly avalable fights of your choosing\n-active communities and friends\n-PIRATES YARRRRRR\n-100 gun broadsides\n-epic battles in the caribbean during a big storm\n-getting rammed by a sloop in your first rate and laughing when the sloop sinks\n-wolf packing and stealing 1st rates with 10 sloops (possibly more if he knows how to chain shot)\n-trafalgar battles\n-did I mention how beautiful and relaxing the game is?!?!?!?!?!?!\n","January 21","true","80.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Ai ships are now much more balanced, and reflect this by sometimes missing, and not being deadeyes. The grind has been tweaked much more so, more xp is given from missions, and all levels' requirments lowered. It's at a nice pace if I say so myself. Lots of new content being added, new ships, new mechanics, the game only gets better. The UI is still barebones, but learnable.

It doesn't detract from the game in anyway because combat is so much fun.\n\nIt requires skill to a degree to aim and shoot at distant targets, cannons (depending on type) help with range and or damage. Tip, when buying them you only require to buy once to fill your ship with the new ones, don't save for ages thinking you have to buy each cannon seperately as I did!\n\nThe map is huge and sailing takes a lot of time on the first ventures out without outposts to teleport to eventually. There is no "you are here" on the map, you have to use landmarks islands and the compass to travel.\n\nClans, trading, crafting, fleet battles large and small, port sieges and leveling will keep this game re-playable. Missions are a bit repetitive but if the devs could work out group pve missions with "bosses" and/or stages the pve side could be interesting indeed.\n\nReview changed to positive since the devs opened up a new server so that 40-60min wait times aren't the norm as they were at peak times on the only EU server at release. Thanks for that :)\n\nIf you are a fan of skill games, then this won't disapoint, it isn't a lock on and shoot type, it's an aim and shoot. With a full sideboard splatter or single cannon after single cannon. Love it. simply simple but effective!\n\nI don't think you will be dissapointed!","January 24","true","22.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If I could go back in time and join the Royal Navy I would. I know the life was rough but the ships are so freaking awesome.\n\nAnyway, this game is like a wet dream for me (no pun intended). I think there is still a lot of room for improvement but so far this game has really satisfied the need for a game centered around these type of old world naval combat.\n\nThe grind is REAL. XP does not come quickly or in large batches but you quickly become lost in the immersive details of the game. You literally have to run your ship and pay attention to everything that is going on. This game is almost like the DARK SOULS of boat games. It takes time, a lot of work and patience, but when you see those 3rd rates riding around decimating people left and right you know it is all worth it.\n\nMy notes to the devs:\n\n-  More XP per PVE battle would be nice. it is 1000xp to the first rank after you start and ~50xp per battle is brutally slow especially when the battles can go on for over an hour (especially when the AI jerkoff bot keeps riding into the wind)\n\n- Add collisions while roaming the open world. Force people to pay attention at all time. this would of course you to stop loading ships on top of each other as well.\n\n- If you are in Sailing mode during battle I don't see why your ship wouldn't maintain the same speeds it does in the open world. Everything should be consistent. I would understand a penalty while being in another mode during battle.\n\n- Please add the spyscope/telescope view to open world!\n\n- When zoomed all the way in on the starting cutter the mast is directly in the middle of the view\n\n- Better tutorial in the beginning. I had no idea how to earn XP or what to do other than drive the ship. Took a lot of outside research to figure out main objectives. I don't mind a challenge and figuring stuff out but i spent the better part of my first couple hours just riding around in the open sea aimlessly not knowing what to do.\n\n- YOU ARE DOING A GOOD JOB KEEP IT UP YOU ARE MAKING MY CHILDHOOD FANTASIES COME TRUE","February 22","true","34.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

With very interesting open world features in and more content being added quite often. Expect a large patch soon that will change fundamental game mechanics for conquering other nations ports and added diplomacy between nations.\n\nIts still in early development and it lacks a lot of finished and polished details but still very fun to play if you enjoy this period.\n\nStart with a lowly cutter and fight your way up the ranks until you have earned the crew that allows you to outfit a 1st Rate Ship of the line Nelsons Victory, if you can find one.\n\nYou can also advance your crafting talents and become a ship builder that help your nation by supplying your fellow captains with ships for trading or cannon thunder, for a fee to be negotiated.\n\nOr a shrewd trader that buys low and sells high, Transport needed goods from a port with a surplus to a port that lacks your commodity and is willing to pay a premium price.\n\nThe choices are yours, But remember The open sea can be a dangerous place. There be captains of other nations with whom you are at war, The smuggler who is trying to bring contraband to you or your enemies, or even the Pirates who wish to plunder your ship and cargo for a night in Tortuga with his ladies and rum bottles.","February 23","true","644.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/berthur/recommended/311310/","berthur","Sir Berthur","http://steamcommunity.com/id/berthur/","118 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nYou've seen the trailers, right?\n\nFew games really live up to its trailers and all its marketing nowadays. This one surpasses it. The realism is there, to a much higher degree than any even remotely similar game I have ever seen. You have your physics, the sea and the wind and the structure of your ship, to take into account in every move you make. You have your graphics, as beautiful as you could wish. And the immersion is there - every battle you fight counts, for good or for bad.\n\nThe ships range from the smallest cutters and schooners to the heavy first rate ships-of-the-line, and the variety in gameplay is enormous as you raise in the ranks. Furtheremore, the game offers other aspects of the naval Caribbean life than combat between nations - trading, crafting, plundering and politics.\n\nThis game already has ten times more to offer than the average AAA game, and so far the game has been growing furiously in both size and quality, from the match-based combat game it once was, during the Sea Trails, to the masterpiece it already is, despite a few bugs and a very rudimentary GUI. And this despite its still being considered an alpha version. It offers no tutorial as such, but instead it gives you a cutter to do with as you please, and which you can replace for free once you manage to sink it or blow it up. In my personal opinion, this is the best tutorial you could wish for.\n\nAnd lastly, I know the price is by some people considered rather high for an early-access game, but I assure you: if you would be willing to buy any of those AAA games for 150% of this price, then you should not doubt going for this one too. And contrary to so many of those games, there has been no talk about any DLCs, suscription fees or any other of that crap yet. And that detail alone is very encouraging.\n\nSee you on the high seas, captain.","February 27","true","228.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Second, and without a a doubt, this game is the best "Age of Sails"/naval warfare game I've yet to play and I've been computer gaming for over thirty five years.  Third, and the best part of it all, this game is only in "alpha stage" at this point.  This means this game will only become better as its developer continues to introduce new content and flesh out their current coding.\n\nAs to what I'd "like to see" (in regards to issues/improvement)... well... some of the reviewers (below) already mentioned what was on my mind.  I'd love to see the "Port" UI improved both graphically and functionally.  As it stands, it is relatively rudimentary but works just fine.  Furthermore, it would be nice if the "world map" had latitude/longitude lines in place.  For if we are to sail without sextant nor maritime map, we should be able to figure out our map/ocean location somehow... other than simple "gamer memory".\n\nAll in all, I look forward to hours upon endless hours in this game.

So if you are the impatient type, you've been warned.. xD\n\nThe game revolves around PvP and a player driven economy like in POTBS. So if you like to play economy games where you make money by crafting and/ or selling stuff and are thrilled by the idea of competing with REAL people over the caribbean market instead of only predictable AI I can again easily recommend Naval Action.\n\nPvP is the other reason why you would wanna buy Naval Action. PvP in this game is won by team play and teamspeak. It is strongly recommended to join a clan since working together will not only just bring victory but will also make getting ships and experience points easier. While 1v1 PvP and single gameplay is possible like preying on lonely players on the open sea the biggest parts are definitely big group battles and port battles. Port battles are fights for the ownerships of harbors of the caribbean. It is a bit like siege battles in total war but with players and on the sea instead of land.\n\nPvE questing is as bare- bones as it can get. The only reason why PvE missions are in the game is to make money and gain XP. There are, however, PvE servers in Naval Action but I do wonder what the frek they're doing over there?? xD\n\nI criticize, however, Naval Action for its use of ranks or player levels. You have to grind a long long time before you can sail bigger and more important ships while I leave it open to debate if bigger always means better?.. There sure are some roles for smaller ships to catch and stop hostile players from running away, for example. I like that there are shallow and deep water ports what makes smaller ships more important and gives players of a lower lvl a chance to partake in the more meaningful stuff of whast is going on on the conquest map. Same goes to crafting, you have to craft a whole lot of stuff you do not even want just to gain XP and advance in level. Furthermore, there's some stupid korean RnG mechanic which makes it very hard to get blueprints for certain ships sometimes.. (http://www.navalactioncraft.com/blueprints)\n\nBasically, as a new player you will most likely run into a period of severe boredom but that only lasts for a while. There are so called 'fleeting groups' which are run either by PUGs or clans to gain money and XP faster. I suggest to look out for those if you get bored with the game!\n\nFinally, always remember that this game is still in alpha!

After a few more hours I got to grips with navigation and once I worked out where I was I had to rely on map and compass, no player location marker in this game im afraid, you are forced to learn and adapt in this wonderful world.\n\nAfter basing my now upgraded yatch at kingston I operate in 5 day tours in which I will go into enemy waters, take a prize and bring it back into kingston for my own gain. I am under the flag of the UK which means I mainly attack French and Spanish ships, attacking an English ship would make me a pirate!\n\nI would recommend this game if you are intrested in the Naval history of this time and have an appetite for the learning curve, however you will not enjoy your experience if you are not willing to listen to more experienced players.\n\nThankyou for Reading!\n","January 22","true","34.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

And to be clear, I have played literally almost every MMORPG ever made, all on PvP servers, and all were pretty inadequate. My entire gaming career has been PvP, since the days of text based online MUDs. I'm old. Whatever.\n\nQuestion 1: Do you like sailing ships? If no, then don't get this game.\nQuestion 2: Do you enjoy "war simulation" pacing? If you need constant action, then don't get this game.\nQuestion 3: Do you like PvP? If yes, and if also yes to questions 1 & 2 then get this game.\n\nI cannot speak as to whether PvE players will like this game. I feel the PvE content is not rich enough by itself. There is 1 PvE server (and 3 PvP servers) as of right now and I have no idea why anyone plays the PvE server.\n\nGrind warning: there is some 'grind'. Your starter ship is limited fun and it may take you a dozen hours or more to really get out of it. That said, it is actually an effective PvP ship (no, seriously, try it in a group of like 5 of them and just go wolfpack hunting. You'll be surprised. To a big ship it's like being attacked by a swarm of killer bees) and you can participate in "Small Battles" off the Missions screen, that are basically PvP arena/cage matches. These "Small Battles" aren't a focus of the game but for a new player they can be a way to hop into quick fights for gold and XP until you're ready to try the open sea.\n\nWhen you're ready for the real game, it's there, and it's a pretty epic wargame. Imagine EVE if the combat didn't suck. Imagine Planetside with a world map strategy and resource control component. Imagine Pirates of the Burning Sea without the draconian "fair fight" mechanics that broke up your groups and guilds.\n\nThis IS early access.\nExpect map wipes.\nExpect gold and asset wipes.\nExpect some crude interfaces for areas of the game that have not been fleshed out yet.\nThe devs have said they will never reset our XP but anything else is on the table.\n\nIf you can accept that then just get it. It really is the best GROUP FRIENDLY PvP experience I have ever had.","February 21","true","584.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kangaxxter/recommended/311310/","kangaxxter","Smooth Trooper","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kangaxxter/","78 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nNaval Action is a hard core, age of sail naval warfare pseudo-simulator, emphasis on the Hard Core.\n\nFirstly, it nails the whole alone on the ocean feel (when you get away from busy ports). Part of the gameplay is learning to navigate using only a map and compass. If you're looking for a real Age of Sail feeling type of game, this is it.\n\nWhat Naval Action is not: easy. Naval Action isn't a Pirates of the Caribbean game and takes basically no cues from the movie franchise. Naval Action is more like Master & Commander than Pirates of the Caribbean. You could hunt a single enemy player for hours before engaging in an hour-long gunnery duel and boarding action.\n\nSpeaking of fighting, the combat is challenging, but fair, and the game doesn't try and hold your hand when you start. It takes a while to learn how to fight with the wind dictating your movement and with guns that have poor accuracy and slow moving projectiles, but nothing is as satisfying as landing a complete broadside and watching your enemy's armor become Swiss Cheese.\n\nNotice that I said Pseudo-Simulator. It's hard to be an actual simulator and be fun, so there are some player gimmes, like teleporting between cities, but more complicated sailing manuevers such as controlling your yards individually and the accurate sailing model give a sense of complexity missing from other naval themed games.\n\nHowever, there are two major caveats that Game-Labs gave up: The first is that you never have to sail at true speed throughout the Caribbean. There's an Open World overmap which you'll probably spend most of your time. In the Open World, the entire map is available for you to journey to but you can't fight in it and can't interact fully with your ship, and time goes faster, which in turn makes it seem like you aren't travelling at a snail's pace across the absolutely massive Open World map. When you reach a battle (either by attacking or being attacked), you'll transfer to a tactical Battle map where you move a true speed at true time and most of the simulator elements become available. If you've ever played Star Trek Online, think Sector Space vs. System Space.\n\nThe other caveat is that it is always windy. You'll never get stuck in doldrums or without a breeze, either in the strategic Open World overmap or in an instanced Battles. But that doesn't mean you can go in any direction you please, you still can't travel directly upwind, though fore-and-aft rigged ships will travel faster close-hauled than square-riggers. Yeah, you'll get to (or really, *have* to) learn some nautical sailing terms in this game, too.\n\nThe game is hard, and relatively unforgiving if you just think you can walk in and trounce the first enemy you see. Tactical planning is much more important that twitchy skill or APM. That being said, there are a ton of guides on the Game-Labs forums that will help you out on avoiding the major mistakes many players make. For good measure, I'll give you a first bit of advice: Don't go British.\n\nGood Sailing, Captain!","January 21","true","520.4"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/henx125/recommended/311310/","henx125","[i]Henx","http://steamcommunity.com/id/henx125/","336 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nNaval Action is a very addictive, slow-paced, deep game with plenty to do that all comes together to make for a very enjoyable experience that is best enjoyed in a group.\n\nAs it stands now, only about a week out of Early Acess, Naval Action is a healthy, promising game with a friendly and invested playerbase. The game focuses a lot on basing its mechanics on players' actions in the game world, and as such you can expect to see a vibrant world form as a result. The game's features are still being fleshed out so there is certainly still room to give players more control over the world they play in, but you see from developer's responses on the forums that they plan to give players the tools we need to make this world ours.\n\nSo what can you do exactly in Naval Action's giant sandbox? First off, you can fight basic battles with AI. These battles usually come in the form of 'missions', or Naval Action's equivalent to a quest. Missions simply order you to defeat the enemy at a given random location in the sea in exchange for bonus XP and gold. These rather mundane missions are the mainstay of the grinding experience for most players as it is a straightforward way to progress and gain the experience and gold needed to get the next best ship. Battles with the AI can also come in the form of hunting down AI trader ships or patrol fleets by yourself or with a group. Engaging with traders is a good way to try and make some money by “commandeering” valuable goods or ships, and engaging with patrols is a good way to get yourself killed; unless you bring friends.\n\nYou can also of course fight with other players. You can do organized PvP in the form of Small or Large battle queues that you sign up for every few minutes in any port, or you can hunt down players in the open world. You can also participate in large port battles with other players against other players to wrest control over cities and the resources they provide.\n\nAnd of course, you can trade and craft in order to make lots of money. These latter options require a lot of knowledge and time to do right, but can pay in dividends. It is also important to note here that any decent ships you might wish to command must be player-made, and crafting ships is no small task. The economy of this game is one of great potential for the budding capitalist.\n\nCombat as a whole is very well done in Naval Action. It is deep and too complex to go into detail here, but know that this is no arcade style ship game. It is slow paced, but can be incredibly intense, especially in PvP and in large battles. Ships are detailed and well designed, the open world is a delight to sail in, and there are plenty of friends and enemies to be made playing this game. I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone interested in games like EvE that maybe are looking for something more than context menus in their combat scenarios.","February 7","true","130.9"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

The game itself has 3 core elements right now, trading, crafting and battles, each of these features have their own fun and challenge to them. The game can be played PVE or PVP, with most people playing PVP, I prefer PVE. Currently You can play one of 8 nations; Britain, France, USA, Denmark-Norway, Sweden, The Dutch, Pirates and Neutral, although Neutral is a bit lacklustre right now and Britain is vastly overpopulated.\n\nThe mechanics are similar to that of Assasins Creed: Black Flag and Empire/Napoleon Total war naval battles, feeling more like the naval battles from the two total war games, going beyond their level of realism. You can control sails individually or have it automatically done for you.\n\nAs a warning the game does not handhold, currently there are no tutorials and the UI hasn't been properly implemented yet, but the community is very welcoming and people are happy to answer questions to anyone on the in game chat, people are also often happy to show you the ropes of battle against an NPC to help you get started too.\n\nThe Future of the game includes a monthly update, adding new features and with a very active and engaging development team who do their best to take in suggestions and answer questions both on their own forums and the steam discussions page.\n\nPersonally I thoroughly enjoy the game, and will be keeping a close eye on it into the future, playing along with each period, checking out new features and being involved with the develpment as much as I can. If it continues on the trend it is on then I expect it to be one of my all time favorite games, I am glad to support it and praise it highly.\n","January 25","true","636.4"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

If you enjoy team tactics, "Eve style" MMO strategy/diplomacy, naval warfare, age of sail history, pirates, beautiful graphics or any of the above I highly recommend you check out Naval Action.  Even in it's alpha stage the replayability and fun is undeniable.  This game is also much more approachable than Eve (not to knock Eve, also a great game) but still presents a lot of the same dynamics that make this genre so much fun.  Plus, combat is not simply clicking the right guy at the right time but involves "twitch" reflexes, accuracy and in general is more instinctive.  Even though the ships are often going slowly when you factor in managing your crew, getting off cannon broadsides/chaser shots, factoring the wind/adjusting sails all the while not trying to hit anyone (on your team at least ;D)... you are never not calculating or focussing on what you're doing.  10/10!","February 14","true","113.7"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ardaxis/recommended/311310/","ardaxis","🅰rdaxis🔥","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ardaxis/","417 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThis game does exactly what it means to; and that is, fulfills the desire of everyone with an interest in the age of sail to captain their own ship and venture the high seas of the Caribbean and Atlantic coast. Despite being early access, it's relatively content complete insofar as the open world is available. People have called the game "EVE:Online at sea", take of that what you will.\n\nCombat is instanced and content complete. If you've ever played the naval battles in Empire: Total War it's pretty similar to that. Although there's an auto Skipper, it pays to learn how to manage your sails as the wind is fully simulated. This game probably has the most realistically simulated water I've seen in a game too, as waves can rock a ship and knock your cannons' line of fire. You can switch your cannonballs out for chain shot to demast your enemy's sails and follow that up with grapeshot to knock out their crew enough for a successful boarding. You can even ram them if you're feeling particularly cavalier, I once got lucky and capsized someone's ship but I doubt that happens as much with the bigger hulls.\n\nI look foward to seeing what else the developers have in store for this game, so far they've promised a better economy and enhanced inter-factional diplomacy. For now I'd have to say it's one of the few impulse buys I actually didn't end up regretting.","January 26","true","40.8"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

The game focuses a lot on basing its mechanics on players' actions in the game world, and as such you can expect to see a vibrant world form as a result. The game's features are still being fleshed out so there is certainly still room to give players more control over the world they play in, but you see from developer's responses on the forums that they plan to give players the tools we need to make this world ours.\n\nSo what can you do exactly in Naval Action's giant sandbox? First off, you can fight basic battles with AI. These battles usually come in the form of 'missions', or Naval Action's equivalent to a quest. Missions simply order you to defeat the enemy at a given random location in the sea in exchange for bonus XP and gold. These rather mundane missions are the mainstay of the grinding experience for most players as it is a straightforward way to progress and gain the experience and gold needed to get the next best ship. Battles with the AI can also come in the form of hunting down AI trader ships or patrol fleets by yourself or with a group. Engaging with traders is a good way to try and make some money by “commandeering” valuable goods or ships, and engaging with patrols is a good way to get yourself killed; unless you bring friends.\n\nYou can also of course fight with other players. You can do organized PvP in the form of Small or Large battle queues that you sign up for every few minutes in any port, or you can hunt down players in the open world. You can also participate in large port battles with other players against other players to wrest control over cities and the resources they provide.\n\nAnd of course, you can trade and craft in order to make lots of money. These latter options require a lot of knowledge and time to do right, but can pay in dividends. It is also important to note here that any decent ships you might wish to command must be player-made, and crafting ships is no small task. The economy of this game is one of great potential for the budding capitalist.\n\nCombat as a whole is very well done in Naval Action. It is deep and too complex to go into detail here, but know that this is no arcade style ship game. It is slow paced, but can be incredibly intense, especially in PvP and in large battles. Ships are detailed and well designed, the open world is a delight to sail in, and there are plenty of friends and enemies to be made playing this game. I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone interested in games like EvE that maybe are looking for something more than context menus in their combat scenarios.","February 7","true","130.9"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

It's still unpolished, with a rough UI, grindy and clunky level progression, repetative missions.  They just throw new players in, with no explanations or direction.  Obtaining even a moderate size ship is the result of many long hours of combat.  Battles are slow, with small ones taking 30 minutes and larger battles nearer to 90.  Sailing a ship to a distant port can take literal hours of tacking against the wind, with no navigational hints or visible land at where you are in the vast carribean, left guessing your position.\n\nYet still, this is the best game I have played in a very long time.  Just a few months ago, before I knew of this game, and in the middle of the Aubrey Maturin series, I found myself wondering "Why isn't there a good, multiplayer age of sail game?"  I asked my friends, and they all agreed this was strangely missing from the world.\n\nNaval Action is everything I had hoped for.  The games slow pace means that combat, particularly PvP, is high stakes and suspenseful.  Rushing in towards an enemy, closing the distance while their broadsides crash into your ship unanswered, only to swing around at the last second and run yardarm-to-yardarm beside them, firing your carronades loaded with grape shot onto their decks as they bear, and boarding them in the smoke, is potentially one of the most gratifying experiences that modern gaming has to offer, with the possible exception of large battles.\n\nImagine 40 ships, some of them with over 100 massive cannons, running with wind, all firing at the enemy fleet at the same size a quarter mile away. closing in to a chaotic 80 ship melee at close quarters, blinded by thick clouds of smoke, fighting both sides of your ship while trying desperately not to smash head-on into friends and foes alike.  This routine occurrance is one of the most epic sights I have ever encounted in any videogame.\n\nI have found myself wary of Early Access games as of late, due to abandonment or extremely bad development decisions.  But not here, the devs seem to pay attention to player's input, and the game, though unfinished, is already in a very playable state.  Though there is not much 'content' as far as missions go, the sheer fun and complexity inherent in sailing battles keep it fresh, and skill very much matters, as a more experienced player in a smaller ship could win through maneuvering and tactics alone.\n\nI can't recommend this game enough.  If you like the age of sail, and are looking for a game to sink quite a bit of time into, this is it.","February 6","true","119.0"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

There's crafting components & ships; there's trading up and down coastlines; and there's combat, both individial and group based.

Find a clan, learn the secrets and amass the cash & experience necessary to become a captain of a first rate ship of the line.\nPlenty of forum and youtube available to learn the basics and gain proficiency.  In port (non ship) based UI is drab and boring, but is obviously only a placeholder.  Only negative is the 1hr server restart every day at 0700 hrs UTC.

I've played off and on since then, but I'm not an expert by any stretch of the imagination.\n\nNaval Action is a game about the 'Age of Sail' that lasted from the 17th-18th centuries. You take command of any one of a number of sailing vessels, starting from cutters and yachts, to the largest Man-O-War. Most ship classes are named for ships that actually existed (you can't rename them as of now, and I don't know if that's planned), and a few from more realistic fiction also fill the roster. they can hold different numbers and sizes of gun, larger crews, reinforced planking, and all manner of other upgrades to set them up for your tastes. Nothing exists at the moment to change them astecticly, however.\n\nAs these are sailing ships, the weather  (naimly the wind) can be your best freind, or worst nightmare. if you have to head northwest, and the wind is coming out fo the northwest, it's going to be a long and slow slog up to your destination. Learning how to use the wind to your advantage will be the hardest challenge you face in Naval Action. You ship can take damage, and if shots hit below the water line, you're liable to start leaking. Masts can be shot off, rudders damaged, and crew can be killed with grapeshot from the ship's guns, Sails can be shredded to ribbons with chain-shot.\n\nThe game itself has a map that encompases the whole of the Carribiean, and parts of North and South America. There are ports for a number of nations, all of them currently at war, as well as ports where any ship may enter. There's Pirate ports (I've yet to find Nassau, though D:)  and Pirates coming out of them. You'll start off by sinking (or if you can manage it, capturing) these pirates, before venturing out to wage war with the other nations, or trading valuble (and sometimes illegal) commodities thoughout the world.\n\nIt's a game best left for the patient, it takes me a good half hour to get to Cuba from Charleston, and another ten mintues to get to Hati or Jamaica. The overworld map is pretty large, to say the least.\n\nthe graphics in this game are top-notch when in combat-mode, though are a bit simpler when in the overworld. The menus are far from complete (though even they have come quite a ways). The sound is suprisingly good for a yet-to-be-finished title. Get yourself a good set of headphones, and you'll be sucked in, with the sounds oc water and creaking wood in between the smoky roar of your deck guns.\n\nPros:\n-The game is quite realistic - Wind makes a difference, and you can use it to your advantage.\n-Looks georgious while in combat.\n-Sounds georgious while in combat.\n-You can sail the Suprise.\n-Bigger ships do not always trump smaller ships (get on the stern of a frigate, and have the wind on him, and you can happily rake him in the backside all day long).\n-PvE options for people to learn on, but while XP transfers to PvP Gold doesn't seem to (a nice tradeoff IMHO)\n-Gives me a reason for having a whole playlist of Sea Shanites (Which I liked before I even knew about the game).\n-You can get large numbers of players together for large naval battles, when everyone knows what they're doing, ti's a sight to behold.\n-The Developers are really active in the community, and seem to enjoy us enjoying the game, which is nice.\n-A large number of nations to choose from, depending on how you want to start out, and what you want your ship's flad to look like.\n\nCons:\n-Realisim means that you can't go directly into the wind like AC4, you'll have to learn how to tack (this isn't as much of an issue for those who have sailed before like myself, but newcomers might want to watch a few tutorials Which I might even make a few myself)\n-Larger ships with square-sails are complex to operate for the newcomer.\n-No ship insurance built into the game as of yet.\n-Not every command can be re-bound. The functions of the number keys come to mind, how I'd LOVE to set up a custom joystick to handle that instead, but it's a bit less conveiniant then I'd like for that.\n-the overworld doesn't look quite as pretty as combat, and you will be spending time in the overworld a lot.\n-no spyglass in the overworld, where you'd realllllly like to have it\n-not optimized, which is to be expected, but those of you who cannot stand anything less then 60 FPS, turn back now.","January 21","true","67.0"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

It becomes apparent very quickly that Naval Action is a labour of love, each ship is beautifully crafted in a way that honours the real world originals, the combat is intense, lumbering, yet somehow despite that slower pace is always edge-of-your-seat split-second decision making. Quite the feat really.\n\nMost of the negative comments here come from the fact that the developers have decided to sell ´premium ships´ in order to pay for the very high capacity servers. Seems perfectly reasonable once you look at the details and reality, as opposed to simply get all hot under the collar because you want everything in life for free. The game world is huge, and to support that many players on one or two servers requires income other than the initial sales. The game is very reasonably priced, and there is no subscription fee. These ships aren´t pay-to-win. Stat-wise, they will be more or less the same as the normal ships, and unlike premium vehicles in other games it is possible to lose them (they can be sunk four times before they are permenantly lost). Seems reasonable enough to me.\n\nAnother reason some of the uninformed masses have complained here, seems to be the fact that there are no ingame tutorials or anything. It´s early access! All efforts are currently being directed towards creating and improving game mechanics. The UI, filler and content like more ship types will follow. Currently they are releasing minimum one new ship design per month.\n\nIf you understand this, then this game might be worth looking at in its current state. For all others, stay away from our baby.","January 21","true","267.6"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

Quick Disclaimer: For people expecting arcadey Assasin's Creed IV - Black Flag gameplay - look elsewhere, this is not a game for you.\n\nHowever if you don't mind the steep learning curve, and being sunk multiple times while learning how to fight an accurately modeled, painfully detailed sailing ship, how to tack into the wind, and sail using compass and stars, this is definitely a game for you.\n\nCommunity is excellent, gameplay is fun, open world is beautiful and massive.

Towns business, main gui, crafting, trading and anything apart from sailing, and battles is extremely basic. Most of the UIs are placeholders. Those that expect port business like in Sid Meier's Pirates will be disappointed for some time.\n\nHowever the feeling of sailing the beautifully crafted open world and engaging in hectic sea battles either vs players or the AI, and mastering the sails is bar to none yet seen in this genre.\n\nThis game is one of the very few in early access that i wholeheartedly recommend to all sailing ship enthusiasts.","January 21","true","154.8"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

These ships include the HMS Surprise, a frigate whose replica may be found in San Diego, the "super" frigate USS Constitution/"Old Ironsides", the 1st rate HMS Victory which can be found in Portsmouth, England and the USS Lynx, whose replica presently sails around the US. The ships of Naval Action are beautifully rendered with mind-blowing graphics and incredible detail, bringing a new attractiveness to the era's fighting ships.\n\nA notable feature alongside ships in the game is crafting. Through a complex and realistic set of steps, players can craft their own ships as to tweak their construction to increase quality or fit their play styles. This makes the game incredibly fun as over time, you can specially craft high quality ships that qualify as "dream ships". For example, my "dream ship" is a "speed-tweaked" HMS Trincomalee, a historical (and still around!) 52-gun Leda Frigate. She's very fast and manuaverable, and through efforts in crafting I produced my own "golden" version shaving down some of her armor in exchange for much greater manuaverability.\n\nNaval Action also does a very good job of accuratley and realistically simulating naval combat. Every single cannonball's trajectory is calculated- hits do not merely lower a ship's "health", but they bounce around, knock over a gun carriage, send splinters into crewmen and sometimes even bounce off the hull and hit other ships! To add, the use of sail manuavers such as tacking, heaivng to ect makes manuavering your vessel much more than using WASD. Historical strategies and manuavers can be easily recreated in the game- raking sterns as to try to disable rudders and to slaughter your opponent's crew with double shot, reefing lower and upper topsails to avoid sail damage (otherwise known as "battle sails"), using a heeling ship to get extra range, firing lower in the water to do more hull damage and much much more.\n\nThe only notable flaws or tediums found in Naval Action thus far are few, and not exactly game-breaking. The UI, at the time this was written is still fairly bland. To add, the game's economy can be punishing for those attempting to craft their own ships, as parts are numerous and can be difficult to find. The overall pace of the game is fairly medium-slow, which may make less patient players find themselves dissented with the game.\n\nHowever, the pros so overwhelmingly outweight the cons. This game is a brilliant masterpiece, and is well worth forty dollars as a true class A title.\n\nThanks for reading this long review, and consider buying the game!","January 21","true","311.7"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

I've played off and on since then, but I'm not an expert by any stretch of the imagination.\n\nNaval Action is a game about the 'Age of Sail' that lasted from the 17th-18th centuries. You take command of any one of a number of sailing vessels, starting from cutters and yachts, to the largest Man-O-War. Most ship classes are named for ships that actually existed (you can't rename them as of now, and I don't know if that's planned), and a few from more realistic fiction also fill the roster. they can hold different numbers and sizes of gun, larger crews, reinforced planking, and all manner of other upgrades to set them up for your tastes. Nothing exists at the moment to change them astecticly, however.\n\nAs these are sailing ships, the weather  (naimly the wind) can be your best freind, or worst nightmare. if you have to head northwest, and the wind is coming out fo the northwest, it's going to be a long and slow slog up to your destination. Learning how to use the wind to your advantage will be the hardest challenge you face in Naval Action. You ship can take damage, and if shots hit below the water line, you're liable to start leaking. Masts can be shot off, rudders damaged, and crew can be killed with grapeshot from the ship's guns, Sails can be shredded to ribbons with chain-shot.\n\nThe game itself has a map that encompases the whole of the Carribiean, and parts of North and South America. There are ports for a number of nations, all of them currently at war, as well as ports where any ship may enter. There's Pirate ports (I've yet to find Nassau, though D:)  and Pirates coming out of them. You'll start off by sinking (or if you can manage it, capturing) these pirates, before venturing out to wage war with the other nations, or trading valuble (and sometimes illegal) commodities thoughout the world.\n\nIt's a game best left for the patient, it takes me a good half hour to get to Cuba from Charleston, and another ten mintues to get to Hati or Jamaica. The overworld map is pretty large, to say the least.\n\nthe graphics in this game are top-notch when in combat-mode, though are a bit simpler when in the overworld. The menus are far from complete (though even they have come quite a ways). The sound is suprisingly good for a yet-to-be-finished title. Get yourself a good set of headphones, and you'll be sucked in, with the sounds oc water and creaking wood in between the smoky roar of your deck guns.\n\nPros:\n-The game is quite realistic - Wind makes a difference, and you can use it to your advantage.\n-Looks georgious while in combat.\n-Sounds georgious while in combat.\n-You can sail the Suprise.\n-Bigger ships do not always trump smaller ships (get on the stern of a frigate, and have the wind on him, and you can happily rake him in the backside all day long).\n-PvE options for people to learn on, but while XP transfers to PvP Gold doesn't seem to (a nice tradeoff IMHO)\n-Gives me a reason for having a whole playlist of Sea Shanites (Which I liked before I even knew about the game).\n-You can get large numbers of players together for large naval battles, when everyone knows what they're doing, ti's a sight to behold.\n-The Developers are really active in the community, and seem to enjoy us enjoying the game, which is nice.\n-A large number of nations to choose from, depending on how you want to start out, and what you want your ship's flad to look like.\n\nCons:\n-Realisim means that you can't go directly into the wind like AC4, you'll have to learn how to tack (this isn't as much of an issue for those who have sailed before like myself, but newcomers might want to watch a few tutorials Which I might even make a few myself)\n-Larger ships with square-sails are complex to operate for the newcomer.\n-No ship insurance built into the game as of yet.\n-Not every command can be re-bound. The functions of the number keys come to mind, how I'd LOVE to set up a custom joystick to handle that instead, but it's a bit less conveiniant then I'd like for that.\n-the overworld doesn't look quite as pretty as combat, and you will be spending time in the overworld a lot.\n-no spyglass in the overworld, where you'd realllllly like to have it\n-not optimized, which is to be expected, but those of you who cannot stand anything less then 60 FPS, turn back now.","January 21","true","67.0"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

Just take a quick look on the game-labs forums, everything the developers do is based on player opinions, they players even vote for which ship gets added to the game next.\n\nThis game is everything the 18th century caribbean had to offer, beauty, danger and hours of sailing.

But I'm glad I finally bought it.\n\n-The combat in this game is solid naval combat. Except for the poor looking boarding menus. Boarding works but it isn't fun and they'll have to change it for it to be fun.\n\n-It is open world and kind of reminds me of POTBS MMO if any of you played that.  There is a map but it doesn't ping your location so you have to rely on terrain and your compass right now. Also the missions are indicated by crossed white swords which can be hard to see during the day ( I suggested they change the color of those).\n\n-The port screen is ugly but fully functional. It does have a little messege saying Test UI please ignore so it will change. Making it pretty is something probably low on their priority list and that is ok.\n\n-The ships are beautiful but I'd like to see more customization of colors on the wood/designs, possibly sail color (but not a big deal), and a maybe a custom captain avatar sailing the ship. Right now every ship is the same color in its class, the deck's cannons do change style depending on what you have equipped,  and there is a very generic crew representation (which is ok enough for me, but some might want more here).\n\n-Sound effects and smoking cannons are great but the game doesn't have a music track yet, so I use my own in the background.\n\n-there is crafting, trading, and gathering resources to build ship which is nice. There is even a chance at making better ships such as exceptional.\n\n-there is clans, PvP, PvE, and co-op play so it has it all there. Not only can you craft, sell/buy ships, but you can also capture them in combat which is always nice(again boarding isn't fun right now though).\n\nOverall I enjoy  the game because I like naval combat and love playing it with friends over voice chat. However I also like customization and role playing which is lacks, but I can see them building on. I can see this game going a long way and recommend in its alpha state if you want a good naval combat game with the understanding the RPG element of it is growing and not complete yet.","June 3","true","39.3"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

There are 8 at this time.\nCombat is heavily based on three things. Which is good. Speed, skill and teamwork. ( a group of small ships working in unison can literally sink a 3rd rate warship.)\nThe Dev team have clearly done their research by reflecting the fact that the amount of guns didn't always win.\nA trade system which works on supply and demand much like Port Royale franchise. It is hard however as prices don't stay the same as players and wars affect both.\n\nCons: there is no marker on the map to show your position in relation to mission markers. (I had a mission near Jamaica but I found that I was next to Bermuda)\nThere is no way points to help with navigation which both these points can cause huge stress when trying to get to your mission. Especially when you get storms around you.\nThere is no way to test drive ships to see if they are for you and you how they are played.\nBase resources are too expensive and experience gain from battles is low. It takes 20 missions to get 1000 experience points.\nYou should be able to ring the ships bell any time with each button press to ring it. ( make use of morse code)\nThere should be a progression table to show what you gain from promotions.\n\nIt is highly function and extremely thrilling with combat and sailing physics and cannon and projectile physics too. It is worth as an early alpha £25-£35 due to its currently working and huge amount if features alongside a already vast community and friendly and dedicated Dev team.\n\nDon't ram a ship bigger than yours.

This leaves fighting AI ships which can do things that you will never be able to do such as almost turn on the spot with no regard to wind and fire rapid single shots as fast as an Uzi. Or you can join a clan and go PvP. From my time playing this is an experience of being bossed about a lot and players b*tching and moaning, then there is the fact of very few other players to fight so battles are always unfairly balanced. You are stuck to one server, if you move you only move your xp, no ships, no gold. On the server I originally chose the player count fell from 1200 in January to 150 when I last played in April. In fact they are now in the process of closing that server down rather than looking at the cause of player desertion.\n\nWhen I first thought of this game I was told the community was good and helpful and in game I will say whole heartedly that is the case. Whereas the forum is rather a dictatorship where if you post anything unliked by the developers or moderators they will either lock the post or erase it.\n\nI have stopped playing this game now, purley as since a recent update the battles are too hard. I am not a navy warfare mastermind or a particularly skillfull games player and without that the game has nothing. Everytime when I log into Steam I hope to see a content download for this game but it has been almost a month now and nothing has happened.

I'd like to go over why I am so happy that I decided to try the game for those that waiver as I do.\n\nI've played Sid Meier's Pirates for well over 1k hours before it was added to steam, this game sort of comes across as a much more in depth MMO version of that. Choose a nation, participate in PvE missions (small and large scale), capture ports of Pirates or other nations for your nation, fight people or capture traders/player ships in the open world, participate in a player driven economy. All of these aspects of the game accompanied by fantastic feeling combat and a true sense of accomplishment along the way, something I've found missing in a lot of games.\n\nIt's true that you don't show up as an X on the map, and must use your compass as well as landmarks to get around. I have yet to get lost (perhaps other than a couple minutes of questioning my exact location), and honestly navigation feels great and after a day of playing I could find missions far off of land easily.\n\nThere are several nations as well as pirates, and each one feels like a unique community. As you play throughout the day you see server wide messages of port battles, cities being conquered, you see in global chat people mentioning huge expensive ships being captured by pirates. The world feels alive, actions seem to matter and when you see a first rate ship sail by or you see people taking part in these huge battles with huge perma-loss risks and rewards, it excites a new player to want to continue.\n\nI already feel part of a national effort, I already feel a sense of accomplishment after getting a new ship and crafting enough to make a lot of gold. The combat feels fantastic, and though 10+ minutes may feel slow to a lot of people for missions, it never feels artificially slow. Each mission is still fun to me, fleet missions feel rewarding and sailing back to port with the risk of pirates jumping me and taking all of my rewards is honestly fun to me. (though very rare, but the possibility is there)\n\nI'm very happy that I'm playing this game, though it seemed hard at first it very quickly became a fluid and fun experience. Though people said missions were super slow, nothing has felt anything but natural and entertaining. This is a game that feels rewarding, the faction system makes me feel like I'm a contributing member and honestly this is the pirate game I've been wanting for years. I hope the development keeps going strong and adding more, but either way I've already gotten more out of this than a lot of games and plan on continuing for quite a while.\n\nCurrently as of writing this, the best advice I was given before playing was to pick EU PvP 1, even as a North American player. There is no noticeable ping in game, especially with the slower pace, and the national politics and action make for a great playing experience.  A definite recommend in its current state, May 20th*, subject to change of course.","May 13","true","121.4"," 13 of 25 people (52%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","52","13","25","0","0"

What was an amazing game with a lot of potential is turning into a lame duck.\n\nCombat is taking a serious turn for the worse as they are trying to move toward a more 'historic' approach to naval battle which seriously reduces the amount of damage done to enemies. No longer can you do damage at 200 meters or further from ships. Group pvp is now more of solo-within-group pvp as you can only have so many people within 200 yards of enemy ships with an angle to penetrate. Battles which were once exciting and skill-based are turning into hours-long snoozefests where you literally have to be almost on top of another ship to damage them.\n\nWhile they may tweak this to (I'm sure they will?) reflect the desire of the player base as a whole, it is indicative of the attitude of the developers. It is obvious that they are making the game that they want to make, regardless of the appeal to the larger gaming community in general or in regard to the opinion of those who they allowed to PAY to test and give feedback.\n\nBoarding combat is extremely uninteresting and detracts from the game. It is basically a PC version of rock/paper/scissors. All the suspense of childrens game with the graphics to match. The ship cannon combat graphics are awesome, but the boarding graphics don't even have crew representations, it is literally a text screen/overlay that pops up and reports the results of the 'hidden' boarding battle.  Some ships have a numerical crew (listed in your HUD) of up to 1200+, but when you board it shows an empty deck while the battle 'rages' in text.\n\nSince the steam release the in-port UI screen has literally been a blue screen with absolutely no graphics. It is about as close to a MUDD based game as you can get and has been that way for the last 3 1/2 months. Instead of taking the time to remedy such an obvious blemish to the game that they are charging $40 for, they are more interested in breaking things that are already working well, such as the combat system.\n\nFinally, the game is a serious time sink that doesn't allow you to just log on for 30 or 45 minutes and accomplish something. You literally need to commit to 2 or 3 hours to really have an opportunity to enjoy yourself. Out of those 2 or 3 hours half of that time will be you sailing around waiting for the fun to happen. Speaking of mind-numbing, the time it takes to sail in between ports is fantastically slow. I have watched butter melt that was more interesting. For someone with ADD/ADHD, this game could possibly be used as a torture device. Handcuff them to a computer desk and make them 'explore' in a 'historical' sense.\n\nThe developers are choosing to ignore testers (who paid to help test their game) for voicing opinions in an attempt (most of the time) to help shape this game. Well, I was a believer and advocate for this game, not so anymore. They seem to only want to listen to those individuals who give them the answers they are looking for, essentially the 'yes men.'","May 22","false","036.2"," 17 of 33 people (52%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","52","17","33","5","5"

You don't need to know a bunch about sailing to get good at this game, but it certainly won't hurt you to know either.\n\nThe statement that it's some kind of professional simulator is a bit silly, but it's got some nice physics and mechanics for combat.\n\nManual aiming of guns and option to command a broadside or fire each cannon in sequence. The details they put into the models even though it's in Alpha/Early Access is impressive.\n\nThe game is visually pleasing in my opinion. Though I imagine they'll improve it as time goes on.\n\nThe devs put out a lot of content regularly and try to communicate with the players. Does not seem like they'll just leave once they get tired of listening to us complain.\n\nOnly downside that I can see is that it takes a long time to do some simple stuff. Some folks would rather see some more immediate action, but it's not impossible (or uncommon for that matter) to go for a 30 minute span looking for a fight but finding none.\n\nPvE is the majority of my experience because I'm on a PvE server, but you get to keep your experience you earn (just not the equipment/gold/crafting levels/ships) when you swap to the PvP server.\n\nNavigation requires you to understand how to use a compass and map in concert. There is NO map marker to tell you where you are and there is not indicator besides a general marker on the map for where your mission will be taking place.\n\nOverall I recommend this game because it's very fun and somewhat addictive. Leveling is a chore, but frankly I like that because it's better than everyone being in high end ships all the time. The sense of achievement is good.","February 17","true","59.8"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"

As for the complexity and realism of sailing an age of sail warship and gunnery, there is information all over the internet. The game doesn't hold your hand in many respects and I personally like that, for instance, you dont see where you are on the sea, you have to work it out yourself. But I hope they can introduce somehow realistic mechanics, maybe a sextant, the sun, stars, or similar to add to realism, for navigation.\n\nThe game map covers the caribbean, whilst large it's not something you can get lost in for days, but I have heard it takes  several hours real time to sail it's width, wind dependant I assume.\n\nThe interface currently is really basic, hopefully that will improve and be polished.\n\nYou can dock in ports, which is represented in port by an interface, no avatar combat or walking around port. You can buy and sell in other ports and I think there is organised warfare between nations on some scale.\n\nNaval Action, has the beginning of possibly a great niche game, one that I think many people may want to play, it looks beatiful, the sailing and gunnery seem realistic. It remains to be seen how the game develops in a broader sense, with trading, crafting, warfare and the meta game, but the nuts and bolts of the game seem well established.\n\n","January 23","true","216.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

There are bugs.  There will be changes.\n\nI have participated in this game since the Sea Trials a year or two back.  The combat has continuously gotten more detailed, and new features have been added.  The economy, for now, seems to closely mirror that of Pirates of the Burning Sea.  The combat focuses on realism wherever possible.\n\nThe map is huge.  It takes hours to sail from one end of the Caribbean to the other.  The conquest mechanics are in development still, but the foundations are there, and seem to work well.  Each nation seeks to localize and then dominate their area, with forays out into other territory.  All is driven by control and commerce.\n\nIf your inspiration comes from the likes of Patrick O'Brian or C.S. Forester, this game is for you.

Open world sandbox, PvP and PvE, port battles, and just the joy of sailing are a few things you will find in Naval Action. Aside from that this is a most enjoyable game.

I have yet to really see anything that could be a bug or even be considered game breaking. Damage modeling is exceptional, and doing targeted shots can be very useful.\n. Not a run and gun shooter or action game. Combat involves ensuring position prior to going into a fight, and using strategy, tactics, proper formation use, and pure skill at manuevering a ship. If you want something that is a slight challenge, with sandbox attributes, and a good solid community then this is one of those games.

I was scepticle with this game at first I've tried games alike to this in the past and although they were good there was nothing that made them gripping, this game seriously has it all.The graphics are actually amazing for this game, they also keep adding little tweaks which make them more intense as the patches come out. The clans are great use and you are part of nations opposing every other nation, get in the right clan and its 24/7 game play.\n\nYou can play this game in several ways depending on what you want to achieve. You can play as a trader and make your money, you can also combine that and be a crafter making ships for others to buy from you. The crafting aspect is actually very good, one being that you don't just get automatic rights to craft anything you like, it creates more thinking and a tech tree to follow, one part makes this part and you only get a certain amount of labour you can use per hour which means people can't gain silly amounts of advantage. Also you have to craft certain types of ships with just a small % of a chance you'll get the blue prints to other ships meaning it takes time and tactic to be able to craft different ships.\n\nNow if you go for the battle side this is a very broad game play. We have port battles, PvP or just plain old hunt the AI. I must admit alot of thought has gone into this; you need to be able to think, control and watch. The devs keep patching this area and adding or smoothing out the tweaks and doing an amazing job for it. When sailing in battle you have to think which direction you are going, where your sails are pointing how much sail you have, how many people on guns, how many people on plugging leaks. It really is in depth as a game gets for this area you quite literally can control everything.\n\nOverall I would extremely recommend this game and urge anyone thinking to get this. The price tag is worth it!!! Constant patches and planned improvements that are set this game to be one you won't get bored on. I've clocked so many hours and the worst part is I never saw those hours go by, its truly addictive when you join the right clan community; my main tip is to join a clan to maximise every aspect of this game.","March 31","true","420.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

As for if you will like it, that is going to be covered in the section below, as for overall what you need to keep in mind this factor, which as in most games is in NA: Grinding.\n\nRequirements to enjoy this title: Not Pros or Conds just "if you apply to these, then get it"\nPassion for Age of Sail or Open Mind, if you are pickey and not particularly interested, dont even try.\nDecent PC, the game is graphics intensive but it is worth it, it is such a beutiful game.\nTime, you either need to have lots of free time or be willing to accept smaller amounts of progress for less time.\n\nThere are various others but those are the main headers that should be noted. As for cons, well, here are some I can name:\n$1600 gaming PC cant run this game much bove low settings.\nThe gameplay becomes repetetive, but in all fairness, real life Age of Sail was even duller than this.\nOpen world FPS is very low if PC is not powerfull enough and needs overall polishing. [Early Access, subject to change]\n\nAnd here are some warnings that I just thought I would throw out there, not pros or cons, just to be aware of:\nThough this game is not for younger kids I still would like to put it out there that there is some inapropriate content for children in the art of the vessels sternplates and bow designs.\nThe game has some semi-official factions that you can find on the forums such as the "SLRN" which operate in unity and perform raids and defend ports, etc. for those who are a bit more committed.\n\nAnyways, that would bring my review to an end, I give this game a 8/10, and for it being an Early Access title with much more planned I give it a 10 out of 10, but that is assuming they are adding much more content as they promise such as a better UI and more ships, smoother open world, etc.\n\n[This review comes from a Age of Sail fan who has played PotBS as well as other well known titles, and rest asured, this blows them all right out of the water. And if you need a quote from all of this it is: "THIS GAME IS AWESOME"]","February 1","true","46.9"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

The GUI is all blocks.  The game has this durability factor that you lose a ship and you lose the ability to play it.  The commerce is not working well.  You fight a ship for 30 minutes and some guy just pops in boards your almost demasted enemy ship and steals the booty.   Really the game will probably never be finished.   When Devs like this steal in to Steam to get early release it is because their funding has run out the investors pulled out... Steam has become the entitlement depot for half finished games!!!\n\nEarly access or not this game is asking you to pay $29 USD for a game that is only about a small instance combat mode.  Well done possibly but they are not trying to layers together a game on top of that effort that is not functioning.   If all you want to do is shoot cannons with a deck view against AI ships then go ahead and pay for it.  If all you want to do is shoot cannons at another player in a small room then go ahead and pay for it.  If you interested in an immersive game that captivates your overall ambition to be a master of a vessel and dominate with your freinds other players in a small room with out an objective then the game is finished for you.\n\nThe other layers of this game commerce is somewhat functioning if you can find a safe spot.  Otherwise you have to spend hours waiting for the wind to change to get into port safely.\n\nYour best bet is to kill AI ships and steal their cargo to build that big ship and fight in the small room instance.  Hope you dont get caught trying to go to port to sell the loot.\n\nAttacking cities happens way too easily.  Maybe 5 or 6 fall in less than an hour.  I am sure there wil be changes to this.  It is often boring with nobody but one side attacking.  Getting to the defense of a city you are not already right next too in this game is next to impossible.","January 24","true","334.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","5"

Has very playable content with VERY few bugs.  Its immersing and fun, but most importantly its CHALLENGING!  Some people argue that its empty in terms of content and a 'grindy' game which is true  (hello?  Still in alpha!) but personally I don't mind the grind at all as every battle there is a good chance you will sink if fighting a bigger ship or even 2v1!  You can group up with friends or randoms and battle against large AI fleets that cruise the waters and have epic scale fights, or have a chill and do some trading and crafting.\n\nNot for the type of gamers who want to blow everything up and own at battles within 15 mins.  Takes a long time to master the mechanics or sailing and aiming effectively and each time you advance in rank and get a new ship you have to re-adjust your skills to fit the new speed/turn/gun placements.  The detail they have put into combat is fantastic, and you have to pay attention to a lot of factors to stay ahead of the enemy to win.  and for such an early game combat looks fab!\n\nIf you liked cids pirates and such you'll love this game!","February 13","true","470.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

The game has a large focus on trade, and the major nations must struggle for control over all of the major trading ports in their attempt to acheive naval superiority. Large scale naval battles are acheived in a grand fashion, with beautifully rendered oceans, and ships. Smoke billows off of freshly fired cannons, and drifts away slowly with the breeze.\n\nBattles in Naval action require a bit of practice, and an understanding of basic seamanship will help asspiring captains greatly. The action here is slower than many games, and requires a bit of tactical positioning; it is critical that players learn to use the wind to their advantage if wishing to avoid destruction.\n\nNaval action is still in early access and has a number of issues at the moment.\nWhile the game is lovely, this graphical fidelity comes at a performance cost; further optimizations will hopefully reduce the strain on mid-range systems such as my own, but with my rig the game is perfectly playable. The UI leaves much to be desired as well, as the developers have opted to use a placeholder GUI while they work on core mechanics. This issue should easily be resolved in the coming months.\n\nCPU:i5-3750k 2.6ghz - OC 4.0ghz\nNvidia Geforce 660ti\n16gb ddr3 ram\n\nWhile It might not be for everyone, I personally rate Naval Action at ~ 9/10.\nTechnical issues keep me from giving it a perfect score, but I fully expect those to be resolved at a steady pace.","March 18","true","62.2"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

While rather pricey for a game still in an open alpha, the game itself is quite fun – with new content being added regularly.\n\nWhile still a game in active development with quite a few flaws and the sometimes painfully repetitious grinding for higher ranks/manpower/resources to make components to construct ships, the freedom afforded in the game is outstanding. Learning optimal angles to sail in the wind, manoeuvring to ripple off broadside after broadside at foes with great plumes of gunsmoke obscuring your vessel, your battleline - and ominously, that of the enemy. The ability to board an enemy vessel to take a grand prize for yourself and the crew. This game exudes the spirit of the Napoleonic era.\n\nMore than that, nothing quite beats the exhilaration of participating in a PVP fleet action in a wee 7th rate cutter against 4th and 5th rate enemy ships.  The stark terror of the sea about your small ship awash from a 25-gun broadside of 18 pound shot, with a mere six-gun broadside of 6-pounder shot to reply with.","April 3","true","30.4"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","3","6","0","0"

So for early access this game would be great as if they did nothing else! Very suprised at the game mechanics, graphics, MMO fluidity, and trading system.\n\nSo what for some of the positives:\n\n1) Easy Chat for Nation, global or learning.\n2) Smooth Battle sequences and transition into them.\n3) something fo reveryone - if trade is your thing, trade. Craft - craft. Fighting - well you have to learn to sail and battle on the high seas, if not you losse your neck to the enemy or pirates!\n4) Graphics are amazing.\n5) The world is vast and based in some of the natural history (although many liberties taken). If you want to sail all over, make new warehouse and dock at ports, expect to have the realism and time invested in doing so. At first I didnt like this aspect, but now after playing hours upon hours I respect it.\n6) Potential. Even though this game is great as is - it has great potential to go in many directions.\n7) Action. There is down time in the game - but if you want action it can be found almost anywhere on the seas.\n\nSome negative points:\n\n1) Hard learning curve at first. If your not dedicated, I could see where you would easily give up. It would be nice to have a tutorial or two for the new gamer coming into the world. So often on the chat I see, "So what do I do - Im new?"\n2) Action will get old - and so will crafting  at a certain point. Although the ship production line is quite extensive, it would be nice to open the ports, towns, and overall system to incude other aspects such as food, living quarters in town, explorations, and aging of ships just to mention some ideas.\n3) Capture and boarding of ships also gets old, would be nice to see something in the way of diplomatic surrenders like, "If you stop shooting at me ill give you half my cargo!"\n\nSo I hoped this helped. Alot of hours in before writing review, and Ive enjoyed this game immensly!\nCheers!","February 19","true","247.6"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","2","4","0","0"

Bear in mind it is still in early access, but if you're a fan of EVE Online or Pirates of the Burning Sea, you should get excited about the potential.  The combat simulation is deep enough to keep you coming back for more, with PVP being about more than mashing skills but also, positioning relative to target and wind, and proper target ranging.\n\nEconomic elements of the game include building and stocking your storehouse with resources to build your fleet, with the higher tiered ships being guild-wide undertakings that must be protected at risk of losing days/weeks of hard work if it is destroyed, (yes ships can be perma-destroyed).\n\nStarting price tag may seem steep for an EA game i'll agree, but if you're the niche player of the target audience, its money well spent for a good time.","January 21","true","646.2"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"

Even while in early access, I have found immense pleasure in sailing the Caribbean, using only a compass and landmarks to navigate, and engaging enemy vessels with a number of beautiful ships. The combat is comprehensive, utilizing demasting, chain shots against sails, wind, and positional damage--shoot below the waterline to start sinking a vessel, or use grapeshot on their weather deck to kill crew before boarding! This game is certainly not for everyone; it is NOT an arcade game, and if you do not have the patience to truly explore and learn the skills needed, you may not find that you enjoy this game.

The game is great, the combat sailing is simple, but has a high skill cap so skilled players can manually manipulate sails for more unique and/or efficient maneuvering.\n\nShip combat can take getting used to because the waves affect the ships, and there is some randomness to shot placement (These are not modern cannon). You need to learn where your cannons are placed on your ship, how your sails are setup, and what that means with regards to elevation and firing angles (ie. are the waves too high, or are the sails too full and canting the ship too much).\n\n\nThis is an early access game, but it has been fleshed out quite well since the open world was first introduced to early backers. The devs listen and interact with the community as well, so use the official forums to give suggestions and use the bug report feature to help make the game even better.\n\nDespite it still being Early access, I love this game.","January 26","true","465.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Once you learn a little you will gain XP and gold to be used to purchase larger ships.  Bigger ships brings more intense battles as well as higher XP and gold rewards.\n\nOr if you prefer to be a merchant you can travel the Caribbean searching for the best markets to purchase base materials like logs and metal ore.  Then transport it back to your base of operations and craft ships and materials that you can sell for a profit.

My laptop struggles a bit (plus a slow internet connection), but I look forward to trying it on my desktop with better internet.  Exploring the Open World is great, combat is fun, and the other players are friendly and helpful.  There is some uncertainty about etiquette for entering battles vs the AI that other players are already engaged in.  Some people welcome the help and others feel like you're stealing their xp.  Hopefully some sort of optional lock-out system will be implemented (or already exists and I just don't know about it).

While the game is more realistic than the others that are currently on the market, there are still some things that throw it off.\n\nBattles are initiated, which are followed by a loading screen.  Anyone in the area joins the battle when its initiated, and others are able to join while its in session by going to that location and joining.\n\nThe game is pretty slow, yet feels very fast paced.  Most battles tend to last about 30+ minutes, but every second of those 30 minutes is a great experiance.\n\nProbably one of those games that over the next couple months I'll put a couple hundred hours into; and will more than likely return to afterwards.","January 24","true","37.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It really is a no-brainer!\nThe seer amount of love and effort put by the dev's in this game is visible and felt\nin the first battle you set off!\nShips are beautiful, sounds and atmosphere fantastic!\n\nGameplay wise, is skill based! There is no RNG, or TAB targeting, or any of that nonsense in NA!\nThe more skill and knowledge you have the better you will fare on the high seas!\n\nGame itself is a nice blend of arcade and realistic gameplay. You can't really have a full realistic as battle's would last\nhalf a day, but it's still far from arcade and does require from a player to be aware of his vessel and its position, strengths and weaknesses , wind direction, sail management, cannon ammo type, etc.\n\nAt this stage game is a pure sandbox. You are put into the world and off you go. You can choose any from a high number of nations or go neutral or pirate.\n\nFor now, game is full of placeholders, and it's pretty basic. Do not expect a full product! It really is an "early access"!\nBut consider that i bought the game a year ago and still had my money's worth out of it at the time where it only had some kind of a team deathmatch in it. Now it has an open world set in the Caribbean with ports that can be attacked and conquered. It supports some basic trading and crafting. (YES, you can get ganked while sailing around but is gives the game a fun factor)\n\nThere are no official tutorials in the game and you will have to learn on your own. There are very good you tube tutorial videos that will give you a good explanation of game mechanics. One i will recommend is RamJB. Forum is also a good place to seek information.\n\nPlayerbase for the most part is mature and very helpful. Will we see a downgrade with the steam release only time will tell.\n\nI could ramble on but in short, this is a great game in the making. If you are a fan of the age, if you like immersive roleplaying games then this is your station! If on the other hand you are a player that is into instant gratification then i will advise you avoid this game as it will not give you any. THIS IS NOT world of warships with sails!\n\nSo support the making of the greatest naval game ever attempted and join us all in the high seas!","January 22","true","492.6"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Even while in early access, I have found immense pleasure in sailing the Caribbean, using only a compass and landmarks to navigate, and engaging enemy vessels with a number of beautiful ships. The combat is comprehensive, utilizing demasting, chain shots against sails, wind, and positional damage--shoot below the waterline to start sinking a vessel, or use grapeshot on their weather deck to kill crew before boarding! This game is certainly not for everyone; it is NOT an arcade game, and if you do not have the patience to truly explore and learn the skills needed, you may not find that you enjoy this game.

It really is a no-brainer!\nThe seer amount of love and effort put by the dev's in this game is visible and felt\nin the first battle you set off!\nShips are beautiful, sounds and atmosphere fantastic!\n\nGameplay wise, is skill based! There is no RNG, or TAB targeting, or any of that nonsense in NA!\nThe more skill and knowledge you have the better you will fare on the high seas!\n\nGame itself is a nice blend of arcade and realistic gameplay. You can't really have a full realistic as battle's would last\nhalf a day, but it's still far from arcade and does require from a player to be aware of his vessel and its position, strengths and weaknesses , wind direction, sail management, cannon ammo type, etc.\n\nAt this stage game is a pure sandbox. You are put into the world and off you go. You can choose any from a high number of nations or go neutral or pirate.\n\nFor now, game is full of placeholders, and it's pretty basic. Do not expect a full product! It really is an "early access"!\nBut consider that i bought the game a year ago and still had my money's worth out of it at the time where it only had some kind of a team deathmatch in it. Now it has an open world set in the Caribbean with ports that can be attacked and conquered. It supports some basic trading and crafting. (YES, you can get ganked while sailing around but is gives the game a fun factor)\n\nThere are no official tutorials in the game and you will have to learn on your own. There are very good you tube tutorial videos that will give you a good explanation of game mechanics. One i will recommend is RamJB. Forum is also a good place to seek information.\n\nPlayerbase for the most part is mature and very helpful. Will we see a downgrade with the steam release only time will tell.\n\nI could ramble on but in short, this is a great game in the making. If you are a fan of the age, if you like immersive roleplaying games then this is your station! If on the other hand you are a player that is into instant gratification then i will advise you avoid this game as it will not give you any. THIS IS NOT world of warships with sails!\n\nSo support the making of the greatest naval game ever attempted and join us all in the high seas!","January 22","true","492.6"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

I didn't really know what to expect.\nI felt like it was just like Elite but with ships. And it kinda is and it kinda isn't.\n\nNaval Action is a truly unique game.\n\nYou join a faction at the start of the game (You can make several characters with different nations) and based on that you are placed somewhere in the HUGE world of this game which takes place in the carribbean, of course. Not all locations are based on real places however. But that's good Imo because it offers more places to explore.\n\nThis is an early access game but it doesn't feel at all like it's in beta or anything. I haven't come across a single bug. Only thing I noticed was that I could buy iron and sell it for a higher price than I bought it for, in the same port, it fixed itself after I've sold only a few iron ingots, so I didn't get rich. (sadface)\nThe one thing they could do better is the UI. It's perfectly functional but it's not very good looking.\nAnd more ships...But I'm sure we'll get that.\n\nThe only real nagative thing I can say about this game is the HUGE initial grind you have to go through to get your first ship. This was almost fixed when they added the Pickle (but it's so hard to get that it's almost impossible). But I personally had to play for about 15 hours before I got my first new ship. You could do it faster but I had to do things in between mission so I wouldn't get bored. Good thing is that the devs have said there will be no more exp wipes which means you get to keep your level which is the most important thing really. Gold isn't as big of a deal. Not too hard to come by. So once you get passed that inital grind you're free forever. (Unless you make a new character).\n\nThe combat is slowish depending on the size of the battle. In most missions you will only face one enemy which is slow indeed, but not nessesarily boring. The larger battles are faster, and awesome to behold.\n\nPeople keep saying the game is very complex. Which I didn't reallt feel. No it's not just a game you can just in to and know exactly what you're doing in 5 minutes. But Give it an hour or so and you'll start to get the hang of it. People are really helpful so if you've got a question you ask in chat and you'll get help. No question is too stupid. (Except how to turn on your engine...)\n","January 24","true","42.9"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Once you learn a little you will gain XP and gold to be used to purchase larger ships.  Bigger ships brings more intense battles as well as higher XP and gold rewards.\n\nOr if you prefer to be a merchant you can travel the Caribbean searching for the best markets to purchase base materials like logs and metal ore.  Then transport it back to your base of operations and craft ships and materials that you can sell for a profit.  If you get good at it there is a huge markup on high-end ships.\n\nFor an "Early Access" game it feels fairly polished.  The only exception is the port/crafting/shopping interface which is expected to get a makeover.\n","January 21","true","331.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

There is some uncertainty about etiquette for entering battles vs the AI that other players are already engaged in.  Some people welcome the help and others feel like you're stealing their xp.

While the game is more realistic than the others that are currently on the market, there are still some things that throw it off.\n\nBattles are initiated, which are followed by a loading screen.  Anyone in the area joins the battle when its initiated, and others are able to join while its in session by going to that location and joining.\n\nThe game is pretty slow, yet feels very fast paced.  Most battles tend to last about 30+ minutes, but every second of those 30 minutes is a great experiance.\n\nProbably one of those games that over the next couple months I'll put a couple hundred hours into; and will more than likely return to afterwards.","January 24","true","37.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Bear in mind it is still in early access, but if you're a fan of EVE Online or Pirates of the Burning Sea, you should get excited about the potential.  The combat simulation is deep enough to keep you coming back for more, with PVP being about more than mashing skills but also, positioning relative to target and wind, and proper target ranging.\n\nEconomic elements of the game include building and stocking your storehouse with resources to build your fleet, with the higher tiered ships being guild-wide undertakings that must be protected at risk of losing days/weeks of hard work if it is destroyed, (yes ships can be perma-destroyed).\n\nStarting price tag may seem steep for an EA game i'll agree, but if you're the niche player of the target audience, its money well spent for a good time.","January 21","true","646.2"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"

Naval Action is a open world ship sailing MMO simulator. It is very similar to Eve if anyone knows about it, but it isn't as overwhelming as Eve. There is several different nations you can choose from, from the major players back in the 1700s like Great Britian and Spain, to the smaller nations like Sweden, Dutch, and even the Pirates. There is trading, crafting, and conquering territory with other people in the nation that you choose. There are PVE and PVP servers, both in US and EU.\nThe map is the entire Carribean, with the entire coast line from half way up the Eastern US, all the way down to the Northern coastline of Brazil. There are a huge amount of ports you can travel to and see what they produce and in what quantities as you plan out trade routes to make money or to craft ships, items, upgrades, etc. As you level up, you can sail bigger ships more proficiently as you are able to command more crew to sail these larger ships.\n\nSurprisingly, I have yet to see bugs besides a small graphical glitch when sailing around. One thing thing that can be a pro or a con is that traveling to different places takes time while in the open world part of the game. You can simply alt-tab or watch a video on another monitor, if you have one, to pass the time. When you are in the open world sailing around, the wind matters a lot in how you travel around, so you must plan accordingly or it will take forever to get to the place you want to go, and wind defintely matters in battles you get into. When you get into a battle, you and the other party will be put into an instance and other people from the two nations can join the battle while it is going on, but they have five minutes to do so before the battle is locked to the players or AI within the battle. In battle, you can sink other ships, board them and capture their ship, or run away if you feel the battle isn't going into your favor, but the enemy can stop you from running away if they can hit you at least once every one minute and 30 seconds.\n\nIt is still far from finished and the devs seem pretty decent as they listen to the feedback the community gives. Also, they have plenty of ships being added into the game as the game moves through early access, along with UI changes and other features added to the game.\n\nI just have to say I am addicted and can't wait to play more of this game.","February 9","true","183.8"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

From the entire Mexican Gulf in the west to the easternmost Caribbean islands in the east.

The community is mature and seems to be helpful. Being able to take ports from other nations, and having it affect the economy and politics of the map is great.\n\nThere have already been alliances made between nations and clans within the game.

Upon Joining the Americans (PvE) I was greated by a warm welcome of other players who asisted me in trading and fleet missions to get me a better ship. All thoguh I'm still out classed by their massive ships we still raid the Spanish coast togehter.\n\nPros\n\nLike i said, constant updatng don't expect for the glitch or bug you find to last long. Friendly players who are happy to join in your vendetas and help in your crafting or battles. Large amount of ships and ship classes to choose from. Even two of the same ship can have major changes. Either diferent thickness or being faster. easy grinding, most missions give 5000+ coins and different amounts of XP, depending on the mission you chose. Absolutly beautiful world down to the waves lapping against your boat. So even when your not filling a ship at port side full of holes you can still sail around and enjoy the scenery. Trading although a good mechanic still a little sketchy and chalengeing to properly do, best stick to sinking ships to start off.\n\nCons\nStill in alpha so major bugs and what not everywhere. Sink mechanic kind of boring they just go straight down. You can get lucky and set the oposing ship afire but still, would be niffty seeing a ship rolling to one side or the other or even completly over and then sink. No set tutorial, just drops you in the middle of the ocean and thats that. Find your own way. Best to look up how to videos or consult your local players. Navigation is simple. Map and compass. To simple... map could use gridlines at least. Finding your missions out in the open water. No waypoint no tracker nothing. You just gauge off your map and hope you get close enough to actually see it. There is fast travel but you can't fast travel with loaded goods and when you do theres a set time limit before you can again. (usually 3 hours) To be expected for an MMO but needs work. Sailing is actual time and requires a tone of time. Even sailing the full American controled coast from top to bottom might take close to half an hour. If  the wind plays nice. Port menu kinda boring but I won't complain about that to much. It is just a menu. Still a bit pricey for an early game full of errors. But has huge potential if you dont mind waiting. Still best to wait for it to go on sale. Massive ship battles are long at least an hour. But the payout is great.\n\nJust a few of the pros and cons. But I recomend it for all pirate or privateer fans. Saill across the 7 seas,  hoist your nations colors and fight for survival amoungest players, enemy nation ships, and pirates.","May 25","true","109.6"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

No matter how pretty you make the sunsets, no matter how detailed the ships, no matter the accuracy of the eye-candy for the period, having to rely on landmarks for navigation is possibly the stupidest game mechanic decision they have made. They give you a compass and what amounts to a speedometer, and tell you to navigate by sight. No concession to anything realistic about sailing is made. The world map is lovely, yet worthless in regard to getting from A to B. Yes, you can see the port you just departed from, and yes, you can see the port you may be attempting to reach. You can even see the crossed sabers indicating the position of the ship(s) you are instructed to sink, etc. What you are not given, and what you will be never given (unless the dev team comes down off their high horse) is any indication of where the hell you are on that same map.\n\nI played Pirates of the Burning Sea at launch, and then again 2 yrs ago. While Naval Action is in the "simulation" category, and PotBS was not, for all of its faults, PotBS was a better game. It had character and style. NA has plenty of screenshot-worthy moments, but the ludicrous and intentional lack of navigation realism cannot but render this game to me anything beyond a mobile Geoff Hunt painting. If you want to sail a pretty ship around scanning the horizon for a landmark to fix your position, then buy the game.  I think I'll uninstall for now and come back when the game is finished. Maybe, by then, the devs will realize that their desire for players to experience being "lost at sea" because navigation tools like an octant or a sextant would make it too easy is a cop-out.\n\nI have not, and will not say anything about the lack of tutorial, etc. because it IS an Early Access game.\n\nIf you have a couple of spare $20 bills lying around, buy the game. If you would rather see your money put to better use, send it to me and help me pay off my student loans.","May 18","false","6.8"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","6","12","2","9"

The devs are working very hard to tweak it, add balance, etc.\n\nBut authenticity comes at a price.  Unfortunately, the main cost is real time. This is a huge problem for the long term success of a game.  Just going on a simple PvP mission can take an hour or more.  By the time you sail to sea (crap - it's against the wind), get to your marker, conduct the fight, then sail back (crap - against the wind AGAIN), you have just spent 30-60 minuites (or more) in the game.

That means if you have 60 minutes to play before you go to work, before your next class starts, etc you can't play because you may still be stuck in a battle by the time you must leave.

For the majority of players with class, jobs, family, etc, the time cost is too high.\n\nYes, if you can only play a short time you can pursue your crafting skills.  But, it literally takes only 10-15 minutes tops to use up all the labor points you have for the day, so crafting can't fill the short time void very often.  You can also make trade runs, but smart players build their outposts so trade runs are rarely needed; why risk losing one's cargo when one can ship in complete safety using the automated delivery system that entails 0 risk to ship or cargo - and again can be setup in 10-15 minute tops?\n\nAnd that really, is all you can do.

I'm all for supporting a developer, I bought this with a friend, that's $80 that we both ended up getting a refund for. Had it been $20, I would have kept it and just hoped it got better.

We got in a sea battle together and ended up on opposite sides. That was the deal breaker for us. *Edit*\n\nThat said, there are not many naval games out there, and I did enjoy the second battle which was a mass of ships, I had no idea what I was doing but I shot things and made holes in sails.\nThe graphics are really nice and you can make some lovely cinematic stills, but uh.. you didn't pay $40 for cinematic stills did you now?\n\nEnd of the day, I'll follow this game and keep it on my wishlist for a future sale that is AT LEAST 50% off.\nBe warned guys, don;t let your desperation for some old timey naval combat get the better of you and part with your money because ♥♥♥♥ like this is part of the problem with the industry (that and microtransactions on full price games).","January 24","false","1.4"," 23 of 47 people (49%) found this review helpful","49","23","47","0","3"

You need 1000xp to Level 2 = Pure Mission Grinding!\n\n- There ain't alternatives to grinding missions, but to attack players of other countries, which you shouldn't do in early levels anyway, cause you have no effin chance\nSo if you don't have mates to help you out in those missions wich are 1vs1 battles against AI Ships and 50% of them will destroy you in the beginning, you have a problem\n\n- one of those missions ( 1vs1 battles ) will last for 30minutes or longer until finally a ship is destroyed and will sink, whether its yours or the AI ship.\n\n- there are only 3 things to do in this game: missions ( which are always the same procedure ), pvp battles ( will be interesting in higher levels / you can attack Harbours too ) or you can just farm Gold by buying and selling goods in different Ports, but you cant gain xp from that and there ain't trading quests yet.\nIf you decide to farm Gold first, you might be able to puchase bigger ships, but bigger ships need a bigger crew, and the amount of crewmember will increase with your rank/level only! so don't even think about joining a battle with a ship that needs 150+ crew and you only got your 40 member in level 1. Cannon reloadtimers will increase drastically, your turning and steering will be horrible, and you can't even manage to repair it either.\n\nSo.. if you're already a fan of ships , especially old ones and don't care about the difficulties during the game, get it and travel the carribean sea!\n\nOtherwise, give it a couple more months and check if they added more content.\n\nAlso feel free to check out my screenshots if you're interested.","March 3","false","17.3"," 22 of 45 people (49%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","49","22","45","0","0"

Here is why:\nFirst of all, the UI is absolutely horrible, and in addition, from what I gather through forum posts and the like, the devs do not intent to enhance it, or at least make it half way decent, in any way shape or form in the near future.\n\nSecondly the graphics. Played on ultra, with everything turned up, the game is still rough around the edges. For example, ropes on the ship are being formed in lines, even with AA turned to max, the contact of the ship with the water is in no way smooth, the vegetation on the islands contains very rough models, and suffers from similar AA problems, and the lighting/shading, is not remarkable either. Combine that with the fact that all you 'll be looking at in this game, are the above mentioned ship, islands and sea, the game is certainly no eye-candy at this point, for me at least. Whether the developers intend to enhance the graphics remains to be seen.\n\nThirdly immersion. Having to go through loading screen after loading screen, even to engage enemy ships at sea, just totaly breaks immersion. I can understand, and forgive, a loading screen here and there, maybe when you enter major ports, but not when they litteraly precede every enemy encounter. Further more, when not engaged in combat, the ship seemingly runs itself, with not crew on deck, as if it was a ghost ship. Not only that, but even when you do get to see the crew, which is only in enemy engagements, the crew is poorly animated, and they do not even engage in activities around the ship, either following your orders, or passivly. They have only 1 animation ,which is to inspect the cannon, and even that is terribly done. This lack of the human factor is also present at ports, that look abandoned as a direct result of this. I really hope the developers do try and amend these issues someday.\n\nMoving on, perhaps the most awful thing about the game at this point, and something that I am afraid will not be changing, ever, is the grind. Going by reports in forums, and videos, along as with what little I could gather from struggling to understand the menu, the grind is horrendously long, even to match that of free-to-play MMOs. Difference is, I can understand why F2P MMOs need the grind, which is to generate income from people skipping said grind. But in a game you pay 40 dollars for, such a long grind is to my eyes completely unacceptable. Sure, im all for not giving everything away at once, but the system going at this point is just off the charts.On a positive note, If the game has one redeeming vertue even at this point, it is that of the combat system. That is truly enjoyable, and the battles are truly engaging. It is however too, quite slow, which I personaly do not mind, however this might be a nuisance to some people.\n\nAll in all, the game feels too rough, and too early in development right now, which is not inherently a bad thing, but when the developers are asking a whooping 40 dollar fee, for this unfinished alpha, that you are going to be testing for them for free to boot, I can not, sanely recommend it. If the game gets patched up in the future, or if the developers realize they are asking too much for a game miles from being complete, and change the price, then I might come to recommend it. Until then, stear clear from this one.","February 9","false","0.8"," 16 of 33 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","16","33","0","3"

Accept auto generated tasks such as "go kill a ship we marked on your map" - it's a pointless mission with no story or any reason to give a ♥♥♥♥. It's just a random ship that you have to kill. No hunting it, no exploring to find it, you litterally have it marked on your map and you go into the instance.\n\n2. PvP - either have a group to play with or get ganked, the same old ♥♥♥♥ as the missions, kill the other ships with cannons. The boarding is pathetic, you click buttons in a rock paper scissors format...So pvp is just shooting ♥♥♥♥ing cannons all night.\n\n3. Trade / Craft - Buy and sell items on the horrible UI. Not only is it a pain to use and navigate, it's ugly as hell. You'll be buying items and then sailing to another port to interact with another pointless boring menu. No story, no reason to give a ♥♥♥♥.\n\nAnd that's it! Really! Shoot cannons, watch your boat sail on the travel-map, and interact with a horrible menu system. No story, no give a ♥♥♥♥, no boarding mechanic, you are literally a ♥♥♥♥ing ship. Not to mention, your crew cycles the EXACT SAME ANIMATION for the entire duration of your battle, they load cannons when they aren't being loaded, they stand there like mannikins, cannon balls pass right through them. This game is downright ugly in the details, but looks great from far away.\n\nThe pricing structure of these Early Access titles should follow the development of the game - as the game gets more complete, the price goes up.

To be worth $40, a game should grab me very quickly with something, anything and Naval Action simply failed me in that regard. The primary pull at this time, naval combat, is novel but you could probably have just as much fun playing Patrician III or World of Warships.

Having played everything from Sea Dogs to Age of Pirates 2 Gentlemen of Fortune mod, I found the setting to be an excellent take on a familiar formula, and a worthwhile update to the previous titles.\n\nUnfortunately it's lacking a lot right now, and is not worth $40 at this stage in its development. First off the graphics in the pictures and movies make it look stunning, but actually in-game I found that your basic ship design isn't much better than Age of Pirates 2, even the deck crew look bad, you can fire your guns from your ship and the cannon fire looks lovely, unfortunately the big billows of smoke will pretty much obscure your shots making aiming in this way difficult.\n\nAlso, the UI is as barebones rudimentary as it gets, and doesn't nothing for the immersion factor, in fact it felt like I was playing a government simulator of wooden ship combat, the ui elements are just that sterile and impersonal. I'm sure that this will change in time, but who knows what quality they'll implement in this feature at this time.\n\nThe other complaint I have is that there's no landing, you can't go ashore, you can't lead a boarding party onto an enemy ship, you can't duel with the captain after slicing through half the crew. I understand that they probably want to keep things more focused on the sailing aspect, but it was a feature in a lot of games like this and it seems like the sort of thing that should be continually developed in a title such as this instead of scrapped completely. To me it feels like a step back instead of a step forward.\n\nThe game isn't open world so much as an open ocean where your sailing mechanics are sped-up and highly unrealistic until you happen upon a generic crossed swords icon indicating a combat instance is available to join. Usually you find yourself joining a battle between a player and an NPC pirate that is underway, you may help out and before this fight ends 2 sometimes 3 other people have also joined. The outcome of the fight is pretty much a foregone conclusion at this point, and the idea that other players can essentially take over your battle didn't resonate well with me.  At present this appears to be how you slowly grind your way up from a crappy sloop to higher level ships and that's pretty much it, please someone throw some ice water on this raging fire storm of smoldering game play *snooze*\n\nUltimately I refunded this purchase because as it stands now, the game isn't worth what I paid for it, maybe in the future after more features are implemented.

Besides being FAR from finished, this game also misrepresents what it really offers.\n\nAll the beautiful videos are shot in the battle instances, where your ship behaves like it should, where graphics are turned all the way up, etc, etc. When you are in the open world, you are sailing a simplified, lower-poly model of your ship that clips through waves, sails straight into the wind with square sails up (and inverted!) and can turn on a dime. When you see another ship in the open world, you can clip straight through it. In open world, your ship doesn't even fly a flag. You can be in the middle of a storm and your ship barely rocks, you see waves clipping through the deck and sides and your gun ports are wide open (meaning, in the real world your ship would have flooded and sunk).\n\nDevs are too lazy to code small fidelity improvements, like gun ports closing or square sails being lowered instead of being inverted by the wind (which would cause the ship to stop or even go backwards).\n\nThe interface is not finished (it's super-primitive right now, like something out of 1980s). The  map is useless (you don't get a "you are here" GPS blip, and neither do you have historical instruments to tell you where you are). You sail by "best guess".\n\nIn general, the game boils down to "sail from one instanced battle to another, fight, either die or get other ship, sell other ship, sail to another instanced battle". You get experience ONLY from fighting, so you have to grind fights to get more experience so you can hire a bigger crew, and then grind gold and hope for a blueprint to drop in order to get a bigger ship. Oh, and your ship has "durability". If you get sunk 5 times, you lose the ship forever. There's no way to repair "durability", it's like old-school "lives" in coin-op machines.\n\nLeveling is GLACIALLY slow. To advance from level 1 to level 2, you need 1000xp. Each fight at this level gives you about 50xp (give or take). Even if you fight unarmed traders, each fight lasts 30 minutes or so (again, give or take). 20 fights, 30 minutes each (if everything is going OK)... 10 hours. Plus travel time (you need to find your targets, and hope they are alone rather than accompanied by escorts that blow you away in a couple broadsides).\n\nTen. Hours. Just to get to level 2. Think about it.\n\nI plunked down 40 bux for early access to this garbage and regret it deeply. Yeah, they gave me some free ships, but the game is just not fun, and I'm mad as hell at the deception. Again, do not believe the pretty pictures, those are all taken inside instances.

I've got 80 hours into the game, and I'm still sailing the starter ship.  Sure, I could be sailing the first square rigger (I just bought a snow), but why should I?  I'm almost broke, the starter ship is free, and I need to save for the next tier ship.  The system is broken.  XP is too slow (by about 4x) and gold is far too scarce.  People will say you can do it faster (and yes you can), but add in the reroll (because I picked France, and no one speaks English in chat), the failed try at trading (which is grindy), the aborted crafting try (which is grindy), and a days worth of exploring, and you are right at about 80 hours.\n\n80 hours (probably closer to 70 due to idling).\n\nStill in the starter ship.\n\nNow, you will get many saying this isn't going to be pay to win.  Call it what you want, pay to play, play to win, pay to skip the grind - it's all semantics.  The people in denial are just trying to set up an MMO with an elite class of players (the ones willing to put tons and tons of time into repetitive missions), while the rest of us sit back and wish we were part of that elite class.\n\nRepetitive missions you say?  There's only ONE mission.  Sail out for 5 mins, kill the pirate (or pirates), sail back.  20  to 25 minutes total (if you know exactly what you are doing).  A resonable pace is 2 missions per hour.  At first, longer, and you will fail frequently.  You'll get about 90xp per mission (on your way to 1000xp for teir 2 - tier 3 another 1000, teir 4 another 3750).  You will need to get to tier 3 for your first significant ship upgrade, but you had better not been spending any gold.  You'll need every cent to buy and equip that next ship  (and after that, you won't want to sail it, because you wont want to lose it).  I like the difficulty - no complaints there.  Only problem - the grind. Rinse, repeat until you are numb.  Grind even more. Oh you can go after that unarmed trader instead for 40xp- what great excitement!  You could also play PvP for xp, which is much more interesting, but your xp rate/hour goes way down - and worst of all you will sink more often.  With anything but the free ship, sinking is expensive - so no more PvP for you!  Great design, huh?\n\nNo thanks.  Save your money.  They make excuses  (it's an alpha!), well $40 sets a pretty high bar, unfinished or not.\n\nI should add, they will tell you that the Premium ships will only be cosmetic, but they are being dishonest. The Premium ships cannot be lost (but can be captured) (see source link below).The non-paying customers (I mean  the ones who refuse to pay more than the initial $40) get 5 sinkings per ship, then they are right back into the grind of paying for a new (expensive in terms of time) ship. That's the reason it's pay2win (or whatever you want to call it - semantics). The starter ship is free, so have fun with that, otherwise get your wallet out if you don't have hours and hours to play.\n\nA few more things...  Although the combat model is great, the AI cheats.  It has uncanny accuracy.  Devs say they won't tone it down because players eventually get good.  Well, this just punishes the new players.  And people don't actually get good at naval tactics.  They get good at learning to deal with a computer AI.  The technique of turning your bow or stern into an enemy to soak damage is almost laughable, and so unrealistic.  Oh, and the cannons are FAR too accurate.  Players are actually aiming for specific parts of the ships (trying to hit the masts, for example, or sneak a shot into the hull below the waterline).  For Pete's sake, these were smooth bore cannons on a very unstable platform!  Imagine you are on a real rocking ship, trying to time your shot with the rocking - you certainly aren't going to be aiming at the mast.  But in this game, no problem.  Shoot that mast clean off the ship if your aim is good enough (there's effectively a gyro stabilizer better than an M1 tank's in this game).  So if you are looking for realism, you won't find it here.\n\n\nFor anyone considering this game, look at all those thumbs down.  This is an accurate review.  Those thumbs down show you the fan boys you'll be playing with - trying to dishonestly bury these facts.\n\nDishonesty seems to be a theme with Naval Action.  Shame, shame, shame.\n\n*source of infinite durability (almost - ships cant be lost, but can be captured) - don't let anyone else say otherwise unless they give you a link\nhttp://forum.game-labs.net/index.php?/topic/4668-open-world-prototype-rules-of-engagement-ship-loss-and-spawning/","January 30","false","81.1"," 9 of 19 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","9","19","0","10"

Instead of adding much needed basic features to the game - such as a UI - they instead ruined what was once the most enjoyable aspect of the game: trading.\n\nIn Naval Action, you are able to craft and sail the few ships that are available in game. A player had formerly been incentivized to explore and capture ports to find resources, make deals with other players, and steal ships to rob them of their parts. I suspect that this challenge was removed because the developers theorized that the playerbase is leaving due to the lack of progress that players experience. However, the game is not fun in the absense of a challenge and players like myself are leaving due to the game's volatility and nonsensical changes.\n\nThere are only three things you can do in Naval Action:\n1) Stare at a featureless port UI screen\n2) Wander around a not-to-scale open world ocean (feels like you're sailing a remote-controlled toy)\n3) Fight in instanced battles, usually against AI","February 9","false","235.4"," 8 of 17 people (47%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","47","8","17","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/babalonkie/recommended/311310/","babalonkie","Babalonkie","http://steamcommunity.com/id/babalonkie/","227 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nPRO's\n\nAmazing graphics.\nComplex damage mechanics, every individual part has a purpose on your ship (Not accurate but complex).\nFun detailed battles (when fairly matched).\nA true to life economy (A little too true for my innocent heart).\n\nCONS\n\n1) The game has not got the right balance of simulation/fun. This subject is very long, but it’s too realistic in certain departments whilst neglecting departments that matter, and they ALL conflict with fun. This game is not a sim OR Arcade... it trys both.\n\n2) Low level Single/Solo players having a bad turn will lose all help from the built in starting mechanics (Missions and Freebies) and will eventually go broke and struggle without help. Game is designed purely for groups and almost punishes lone ships. If you spend hours looking for a balanced opponent, it’s ok but if you do ANY missions (which is only the level based port missions, which is also the main source of starting wage/currency/experience, as only ship battles give XP), It will always pare you up a level and not your current ships rate, so for example you lost a previous good ship and have downgraded due to cost... Those missions become impossible solo in a crap ship. Just entering the missions to check will cost you as you will have to repair your ships trying to run away. If you fight, you’re up against X2 vessels higher than your ranks corresponding ship. This at first was not much of problem, but with the improved AI its impossible now without help or a better ship. You gain little as your repairing and it takes allot of time and money to buy or rank up without exploiting the market. Capturing a ship is near impossible whilst solo in missions as you will sink either by the shear time or by the other ship. If you lose a ship you go down a massive jump. If you’re not good you will eventually resort to a starter ship and have no missions to help you. You will have to earn from random encounters with very low ships (few of). If you go after a ship correctly tiered in the vast ocean (up to 3 hours looking), it will take a good hour in real time to capture her), whilst realistic... not at all fun for any casual player that does not want to play the game for 10 hours straight every day whilst doing nothing the majority of the time.\n\n3) Economy has been owned By a large group of people, Basically they dictate all ship prices and put out other starting traders, devs have been made aware of this obvious event but have done nothing (You come on the early hours you can see them talking in chat and sailing in trade ships). The shop generated ships will be bought by them and relisted at stupid prices (1000% above the reccomended level price). So you can forget about your appropriate priced replacement ships unless you spend hours crossing the ocean with no guarantee of finding anything. So a good feature for those just wanting to exploit money, a bad feature for ANY casual player or anyone here wanting to focus on the ocean battles rather than the economy. Low level players having a bad turn will lose all help from the starting mechanics and will eventually go broke and struggle without help. When they introduce paid for content (They have announced paid DLC)... no doubt the market exploiters will gain real money in some way (Selling gold IRL etc).\n\n4) Weird and basic bugs with questionable help from "Admin". Chat, friends list and text sometimes disappeared and when I reported it with various other issuesI was told "Well no one else is experiencing it" with their admin reading and replying to my posts in a demeaning and unbeliavble manor. Next day it seemed to "fix itself" for everyone in my TeamSpeak. It happened a couple of times later and is mentioned in a much later update... Good acceptance of an error report right? Also the bad exploited economy, AI ships performing 100% whilst only having 5/160 crew, bad provided help mechanics for solo's, bad MM and the newest bug is being teleported to the other side of the map (ALOT... of sailing time back) and without my stored equipment, no ships and no docks (So can’t stay there and cant have any fun).\n\nOn all, my personal opinion is it’s not worth the cash as its all eye candy unless you want to start exploiting mechanics for gain. I bought the game in its private kickstarter and realy liked the introduced features back then... but now its all different and not all good. The game is not a Sim nor Arcade game (I like both type of games)... but its simulator aspects hamper the fun, even though it could do it right, by putting in restrictions for certain actions and tweak AI, they seem to desire either corruption or a game that a small population will desire. There is just too little features in this game. Lots of people out there have joined the exploitation of the economy and will defend this game visciously purely because of that trait. Others will just like the realistic feeling in the ocean and the awe left from a battle. But most will eventually succumb to the lack of content at the present or experience the Bankruptcy/Little progression.\n\nThis review is open for adjustment as the game goes on, but EA or not... it will get a review always based on the ORIGINAL COST VS CURRENT FEATURES during a reasonable time frame.","February 29","false","153.8"," 8 of 17 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","8","17","0","0"

It is advertised as an MMO with many different features to keep you interested, and at this point I dare say it is falsely advertised.\n\nIn the early days of EA resources were scarce and crafting was a challenge. You had to compete with other players for limited resources and not everyone could craft a ship every day. This also gave incentives for your nation to expand and take the ports of others in order to give your nation access to more resources. I enjoyed the competition and enjoyed nice ships being a rarity. The developers have since catered to care bears who only want an easy mode game, and as a result there isn’t really anything left to do. Resources are now in infinite supply. There is no point to capturing the ports of other nations for their resources. You will find everything you will ever need in an infinite supply in the ports right next to your capital.\n\nThe developers plan on wiping many aspects of player accounts due to the influx of cheaters. They have said they will soft wipe the servers, which means players will lose all of their gold, ships, and resources. They do not plan on wiping XP or crafting level. This won’t slow down a cheater who by definition isn’t playing by the rules; instead it will punish the average player. Sounds fun doesn’t it?\n\nThe one thing this game does decently is the combat. There is some fun to be had in pvp. This alone may keep you interested for a couple of days but it too will become monotonous and boring quite fast. When I started playing there were enough players to be spread around 2 to 3 different servers.

The open world is cool though. I like how the wind actually matters with the sails. But once again, there is nothing telling you about the controls. Grinding might be easier if I knew what to do. How does the trade system work? How does battle system work? How does the upgrade system work? How does the ship equipments work? I don't know any of these things, yet they are needed to play the game.  I don't like to give games bad reviews, but this game is not worth $39 I paid.

All good right?\n\nNo it has no end game besides faction battle on the PvP servers between factions, none on the PvE side at all.  Crafting in game is the same formula used 20 years ago.  So what you have is an MOBA  pretending to be an MMO with limited arena battles, all battle are instanced.  Gets dull after about 100 hours of play.\n\nOn PvP it's already devolved into a few Mega clans that work together mostly doing PvE battle vs NPC cities.\n\nThe game is one of the best looking Unity engine games to date but, it's never going to blow your mind and like all Unity games it makes your GPU work harder than it should for what you get.\n\nIf that is enough to buy it, you will be happy otherwise move on.","February 7","false","159.9"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","6","13","0","4"

You have depth and possibilities of gameplay and it's not easy to get into, but if you perservere with it (which I have not) I believe there are rewardings to be found here. However at it's current state, the game has a steep curve to get into, very basic graphics and in general everything happens in slow motion. However the slowness is due to the simulation aspect of the game and does not differ from fsx in that respect. I mean your'e supposed to sail the sea, not fast travel it. I feel this will be a game for the experienced players and niche market, which as with fsx or other sims, is not bad thing at all. It's still getting patches and releases so the devs are at least doing something with this. I sure hope it will see a finished day someday and then I'm happy to take another look at it.\n\nThere are severe annoyances that the community has been griping about for ages so lets hope the devs pick up on that one, such as the possibility for newbie players wait for experienced players to battle to death and then at last minute a newbie joins in and loots the shipwreck right before the winners noses or similar. Takes the wind off from playing competetively, and right now that's basically the playerbase this game has at the moment. Only curious and hardcore are willing to put up with this game's raw state of development. For these reasons I would advise to wait before getting this game, unless of course your'e that type of person.","March 2","false","1.4"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","6","13","0","0"

The developers don't really see what will keep a gamer  playing their game and what wont. It is not player balanced with nations. Basically it is USA and Brits fighting. If you are a player that doens't like to struggle in a game then join the USA nation and be bored most of the time. If you would like to have a challange and maybe get ♥♥♥♥♥ daily by USA now and then, then you shoudld join one of the other many nations in this game.\nAnother thing that is pretty bad about this game is that the gameplay is pretty repetative gameplay. No matter if you are pulling some NPCs from a different nation or doing missions on your own, it is all the same thing it never changes or there isn't anything different on how the scenario can change depending on the weather or any other factor.\n\nMy recomendation to those who are thinking of buying this game is that if you would like to spend the money to see how the game is, well just watch videos first of the game on Youtube and then make your decision.

Yes, a lot of work still needs to be done. When you first log in, the menus might put you off a little. They are functional, but ugly. Once you set sail however..... wow. Just wow. The ships, oceans and shorelines look stunning. Some days you sail on a calm sea under a hot bright sun, other days you will find yourself in a wicked storm that limits your visibility and slows you down. Rain and thunder roll over you and your ship heaves over the waves.\n\nCombat is amazing as well. It takes skill to maneuver your ships around, especially in the massive port battles! Those usually start out with the two opposing sides forming tactical lines, but halfway through the battle you will find yourself amongst a boiling mass of angry cannons, thick smoke and breaking masts. Ever seen one of those old paintings depicting an age-of-sail naval battle? It's like that. Exactly like that.\n\nAlso; the community is great. (And please; if you decide to buy this game, keep it like that!) The game is not for the faint of heart. You have to navigate around the map yourself (no TomTom in this game), and because there's no manual or other documentation yet it can be hard at first to understand everything. That's part of an Early Access release. But the community is there to help and it does a splendid job. Never before have I been brought up to speed in a game so quickly with the (freely offered) help of others!\n\nAnd last but not least; the dev-team is great. They keep the players up-to-date through the forums on a very regular basis. They say what they're going to do and they do what they say. Player suggestions, complaints and requests are answered and taken into development whenever possible. Amazing work for such a (relatively) small team of developers.\n\nIf you love movies like "Master and Commander", enjoy the ship-battles in "Pirates of the Caribbean" or enjoy watching age-of-sail documentaries about battles like Trafalgar, Chatham or the lives pirates really lived in the 17-1800's, then this is the game for you.\nRemember; it's early access. Not everything is completed and you'll have to climb a bit of a learning curve, but it is well worth it!","January 22","true","565.9"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

( Currently, you just shoot ships. It gets pretty mundane really fast )\n\nWhat you will get if you pick this up:\n- Highly detailed warships\n- A gorgeous open world with very well done weather effects and ocean effects that actually effect you\n- PVP or Missions or a super simple trading system geared towards warship construction\n- Long sail times between ports\n\nI am not recommending this at this time due to the fact that the devs seem to be unsure of what to turn this game into or maybe they just don't want to share their roadmap and the current lack of content for the era it takes place in just makes it feel very empty.

A realistic sailing simulator, with pretty ships during the age of sail, tons of fun playing multiplayer. It's really exciting to be in a big naval battle, line formation, giving the ships of the line their name, just  firing upon the other fleet, watching the smoke build up more and more as the battle goes on. The sounds of the cannons echoing over the ocean, and then the cracking and splintering of wood as the cannons impact the hull of the ship, with little pieces flying all over and landing in the water.\n\nApart from that, there is also the open world, which allows trading, exploring, sinking pirates, the usual stuff one would expect from a naval open world game. The time is sped up in the open world, but the travelling time is somewhat realistic, with the carribean area being very detailed in terms of islands and nations.\n\n\nWould I recommend this game? Definitely, it's not finished yet, early access and all,  there are still a lot of missing features, especially in regards to the open world, but the game already brought me so much delight, that I definitely got my money's worth.\n","January 21","true","62.8"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","3"

It is a game of patience at some times when it comes to travel due to the size of the world yet this smooth sailing I don't find dull but more of a nice break after battle.

It does naval battles very well, but it also does an open, real time world very well too. The game has plenty of content in terms of both progression and exploration. The world is huge. It sort of simulates a live economy of goods and services. There's also almost a dozen factions/countries with a pretty decent community so far.\n\nThe game plays well and looks good. There are a ton of 'Pros'. The only two 'Cons' is that it's a massive time Vampire and there are a couple of bugs that are super annoying right now. I imagine the later will get fixed, but the first is going to be up to you.\n\nIt's all multiplayer and getting together with friends is easy, fun, and fairly balanced.

The grinding has been all over though, the UI is pretty ♥♥♥♥ but the gameplay is where it stands at its best. You could actually feel the quality over quantity on the ship battles, because numerous times I have had for example 5 more basic cutters (first ship) than the other team, but gets destroyed by a 3rd rate. That just tells you how powerful the expensive and big ships really are, it's quite scary to face one of these in small or large battles.\n\nThis game has port battles which I haven't come through yet because of me ranking incredibly slowly in 80 hours. You'd probably not spend as much time to get up in rank, but for me it's been a pain in the ♥♥♥♥.\n\nSo in conclusion, if you have a lot of spare time you could try play this game, especially if you are interested in naval warfare.

It is an experience, and not one to be missed.\nI have thoroughly enjoyed every minute of playing this game. Sure, I was a bit frustrated with some of the gameplay at times, but that was my own fault. Naval Action takes a bit of time to get used to the mechanics, but it is no where as bad as EVE Online's learning requirment. Playing a few battles here and there will get you caught up to speed with how the game needs you to play.\n\nI was part of the Early Alpha of the game that you could only fight/battle (AKA Sea Trials), and even then I enjoyed the gameplay. Since the "Open World" segment was released, I have enjoyed it even more. During the Sea Trials, you were put into a arena to bombard your enemies with balls made of iron, however it was not a arena of land. No, you fought on a large sea map, with small islands that dotted the horizon, while other times you were surrounded by mountainous land formations.\n\nThis game may be created in the Unity game engine, but the team at Game-Labs has done a increadible job making the game look beautiful and play well. I hear many developers complain about how the Unity engine looks terrible, but Game-Labs has created a game to show just the opposite of what many devs think of Unity. The boats you sail and fight in look stunning and the environments are just as good.\n\nWhen this game releases, I hope that many people give it a chance, because those who choose not to will be missing out dearly.","January 22","true","211.6"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","40","2","5","3","0"

Less than 12 hours in, the game is packed full of action and adventure. Not only that, but it's actually the best Age of Sail game I've ever seen. Literally. Early Access truly does not exist to these developers in their dictionaries. They have dedicated their time to make one of the best games in the Naval category. After starting as a basic cutter, you progress through the ranks of your nation (or "pirate nation") and end up being a First Rate ship of the line*. During this time you'll experience friendships, hardships, fun, and other emotions. But in the end, you love the game and enjoy the work you've taken in over the time of such. You learned how to trade, how to fight, and how to ship as a naval captain.\n\nIf you want to play a game filled with adventure, action, the sea, and naval combat, then this is the right game for you. Maybe you just want something to waste your time on? Then this is your game. I recommend purchasing this game in Early Access for multiple reasons that are too much to explain on this. In other words, you'll have a great time with this title.\n\n*I do not currently own a 1st Rate ship.

Naval Action captures the difficulty, chaos, and terror of naval combat unlike any other game since Silent Hunter III. Its open world is influenced heavily by EVE Online and Mount & Blade, and while systems are rudimentary, they are all in tact and functioning. The size of the world is truly impressive -- the entire Caribbean, modelled precisely. It takes about 3 real-life hours to cross the map, if you have the wind... The political system is very intriguing and already shaky alliances have formed between certain nations.\n\nGameplay is remarkably tight for an early access title -- I have encountered literally no bugs, glitches, freezes, etc. The combat is difficult but accessible for new players, and the graphic fidelity in the battles is basically AAA quality -- think a cross between Wargame: Airland Battle and World of Warships at max settings but with MUCH better ocean, sound and smoke effects. Ships are modelled in much more clarity and detail than WoWS and waves and storms can dramatically influence battles.\n\nThis game needs more press and exposure. I've played every major war game, sim, etc., and Naval Action is the most promising I've played in a long time.\n\nIs it worth $40? Absolutely. The test UI is clunky and certain features need iteration, but the game is pretty much there and without the glitchy nonsense that afflicts most Early Access titles. This is 100% more polished than Day Z SA.\n\n","February 23","true","103.5"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

This is a very good game. Though it takes some time to get gold and ships do cost a lot... This game is still in development and I would strongly recommend you trying this game out if you are into a very realistic sailing simulator set arround the pirate age. I love the combat in this game and I hope they will add different maps and reigions to the game, also lowering ship costs in the game might make it easier and more fun to play. So it definately still needs some big changes to be made. There are only a few ships affordable (easy to get with the amount of gold you earn in each battle) are only a few.  I think this is a game that really shows off the "Age of sail" and at the moment I give it a 8.9/10\nsince it still is in alpha stage and I personally think that there are quite a few improvements to be made and many things to be added.

I cant recommend it enough, IF you are a fan of Age of Sail era naval games.\n\nThe pacing of the game is perfect, with no arcade like "turbo sail ships" as in many other games.\n\nThe dev team have NAILED the graphics, with the sea the weather and the ships an absolute joy, and the sounds are great too, although nice and subtle. The creaking and groaning, and more importantly booming guns and cheering crews when you dis-mast an enemy really give you an immersive feeling. The combat is incredible, with billowing smoke obscuring everything, and gun flashes roiling out of the smoke. Super fun, super cool looking and finally the Age of Sail game I have been waiting for.\n\nDon't think you need to grind this game as an RPG style progression MMORPG. You can have great fun and great fights in the starter level ships and some of the smaller ships once you progress a little.\n\nTeam up, or play solo, just get on board!\n\nThe thing that amazes me, is this is just the early access! It is fantastic already and can only get better.....\n\nWARNING. it DOES represent the Age of Sail fairly accurately, so while open world travel is slightly accelerated it still takes a long time to go any where far away. And in game combat can be very slow (RIGHTLY!) so if you want arcade action, this isnt for you.

Plenty of others better at this game than me have done that. What I can say and assure you is that you will get your moneys worth. For an early access game this is very solid. To me it seems they nailed the ships, fighting, sailingmechanics and left things like the ui to be worked on and other things too of course. But making what has to do with ships spot on before release makes it a very enjoyable early access. The game doesnt seem to suffer from having an application run on the side like spotify or mediaplayer playing music (movie music in my case to enhance the atmosphere). Sailing isnt just turning left or right as you will find out. You can change to manual skipper that makes you control the trim of the sails and make much sharper turns but it will take some training to get it right.

I played on the PVE server first to get a feel of the game  so I will not address PVP, but instead talk about the mechanics and PVE features.\n\nThe game is set mostly in the Carribean, where the player can be a member of one of eight factions of varrying historical appropriateness (Spain, Great Britain, Denmark/Norway, the United States, the Pirates, France, the Netherlands and Sweden).\n\nThe game map extends from Deleware to the north coast of South America, east to the Lesser Antilles and west to the east coast of Mexico and the Yucatan.   I haven't counted the number of cities and towns on the map, but it looks to be over 100.  The cities are divided between the various factions and also 'neutral' and "Free" cities.  Players can dock in any city owned by their faction or sometimes neutral cities, and  on the PVP server, capture cities.\n\nAt this time, you can only have one character per server. You start out with the smallest ship possible - a cutter -- but when you earn money you can add upgrades or purchase (or capture, or build) bigger, better ships.\n\nNavigation between the cities reflects the challenging theme of Naval Action.  There is no 'You are here' marker on the map so players must navigate using an in-game compass, dead reckoning, and loking for landmarks on the map.  If you get lost, there is a handy 'teleport me to my capital' button that can be used every few hours if you are truly desparate.\n\nSailing is also more difficult than most typical age of sail games.  For example, while I loved the sailing parts of AC: Black Flag, I couldn't help but wince at the fact that the sailing ship acted like a motorboat, ignoring the wind that-- you know -- defines the age of sail. Naval Action has captured similarly the beauty of ploughing through turbulent waves, but does a more realistic job.  Ships sail faster depending on your relationship to the wind's direction and you WILL come to a dead stop if you try to sail directly into the wind.  Bigger, more advanced ships require the player to manipulate two separate sails when turning into the wind in order to avoid getting stuck in comat.\n\nThe combat also takes a more realistic approach to cannonfire.  Cannon are treated as balistic weapons in this game, not lasers and there isnt a simple guide showing you exactly where to aim to hit your target.  Cannon are manually aimed;  you have to pay attention to distance, judge the fall of your shot, and adjust your aim on the fly.   You can fire a single shot to judge the range, or broadsides to fire all at once.  This means you will lose -- a lot -- while you hone your gunnery skills.  Luckily, death means respawning at the closest port.\n\nNaval Action at this time doesn't do much to help novice players.  There is no tutorial, it just dumps you into the world to fend for yourself.  While not all EA games have a tutorial (it is, after all EA), I'd hope the more difficult, less intuitive games should have something to guide a player on the basics. Luckily there are many videos on YouTube that can help explain gunnery, sailing and crafting for new players.  There is also an in-game help channel and players are more friendly than most games I have played.\n\nThe game is beautiful, huge and very rewarding, but it is in early EA.  This doesn't mean its buggy, what it means is that there isn't a lot of variety in many of the key ways of leveling your captian, making it kind of grindy.  One major feature are missions -- jobs you take while in port.  These all involve going to a spot on the map and duelling another ship.  You can hunt ships on your own, but this takes longer and also lacks tactical variety.    There are more PVP things to do like taking towns and fighting other players  but again these seem to involve more of the same missions above.  The developers have indicated that the really polished aspects of the game are sailing and combat, but most of the other features they plan are still in development.  For now, I think it will struggle to hold the interest of a lot of players until more features to make leveling more interesting.\n\nSome other badly needed features include a tutorial to help overwhelmed players.  Curiously, the developers tied Exp to your Steam account, so if you play on one server the Exp carries over to new characters on every servers.  While this might seem good, ships and money do not transfer, meaning that your 6th level character has to fight 6th level missions in a newbie ship.  The developers also need to reign in abuses of random encounters -- where other players can join your ongoing battle and help -- or greif  -- you.  Oh, and it seems surprising you cannot name your ship.\n\nLuckily the developers seem to be listening and dedicated to improving the game.  They have a thread where they ask players to post their three biggest gripes about the game, and I hope they use that to focus their efforts.  I will likely keep playing until I get tired then return to it periodically as more content is added and these issues are addressed.","March 14","true","37.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I am involved in the development process of this game for more than a year now.\n\nFrom the start, I was very impressed by what the Developers want to create here. And that with a quite small team of developers.\nSure,there are some bugs and the game still isnt completely finished (for example there is close to no GUI for the Harbors), but you can see the effort which is put into developing the game. And the progress is also visible. This is no game, which might end up not getting developed further. For more than a year I could follow the development progress and see first hand, that tester suggestions are taken seriously and often even get implemented into the game.\nThe game has absolutly great sailing and gunnery physics and its a blast to sail around in the caribbean with some friends, searching for enemy fleets to destroy. Or prepare and execute a port assault together to get access to additional ressources for your faction.\nSo if you are at all interested into the Age of Sail, this game is YOUR game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gamernoobjay/recommended/311310/","gamernoobjay","Gamer Noob Jay","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gamernoobjay/","106 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nSo it's time to change my review since I'm now 800+ hours into this game.\n\nI have pretty much experienced all the game has to offer, and I have to say Naval Action is my game. It's my Star Wars Galaxies, my Eve Online, and every other game I've played over the years that has sucked me in to become an obsession.\n\nLet me be blunt. Naval Action falls into the marmite category in that you will either love it or hate it depending on what you look for in a PC MMO.  It is NOT a game for people who want instant fast paced action. It's not a game for kids, and it's not a game for those who don't have even a slight interest in 18th century naval warfare.\n\nIt IS a game for the more mature gamer who enjoys a PVP game that has moments of inactivity (sailing) with burst of exciting naval combat with opposing players. The ships are beautiful and combat is very realistic.\n\nI've read all the recent negative reviews about this game having no end game content. Frankly I find this absurd. The end game 'content' quite simply is PVP. These guys have rushed to get in the biggest ships then wonder why people run from their 1st rate fleet. Their ego limits their ability to get out of their first rates and into something more PVP focused. In addition, they forgotten that this is an ALPHA game with much of the content still in development.\n\nThe other comments I read are about chat bans. As a 41 year old gamer, I've seen it all. Many MMO's have such a toxic community, it can be enough to put you off playing the game. NA on the other hand have a low tolerance attitude towards toxic idiots who have gotten it into their heads that due to the anonymity of the internet, can say and do what they like without fear of consequence. In naval action, such idiots are quickly dealt with leaving the rest of us rational and respectful players to get on with the game without having to deal with the drama queens.  Seriously folks, if you've been turned off a game because of its community, you'll find the NA community to be one of the most helpful and friendliest out there.\n\nSo as a potential purchaser of Naval action, let me tell you about what you can expect.\n\nOnce you get through the early stages of the game and get into a ship that has a role in combat, you will want to join a clan. NA is a social game and really it's all about the clan. Do your research, find a good one and I can promise you, you'll have a great time.  Once you are sailing with your clan, your world of possibilities opens up, and you'll spend a lot of your time going out and either defending your own waters against enemy players who try to harass your countrymen, or you'll go to their waters and try to harass theirs.  PVP is usually never hard to find.\n\nFor the PVE'ers, there is content for you here too, but I can imagine without PVP, it will become repetitive fast. PVP is were it's at!\n\nLike EVE online, NA has it's interesting politics. You'll no doubt find a nemesis, that guy you are determined to catch and sink.  There's lots of personalities out there, and you could be one too. Being 'famous' is all part of the attraction of NA, just like the real sea captains of the time.  For me, it's these clashes of personalities ad egos that makes this game so much fun.\n\nAt £29.99, in terms of fun per investment, I can tell you with my 800+ hours in this game, It's given me approximately 790 more hours of fun than AAA The Division at almost double the price.","February 19","true","961.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

And nothing quite as humiliating as sinking after a heavy defeat, or seeing your crew decimated prior to being boarded.

Combat occurs when a ship chooses to attack you (and attempts to keep you within a certain radius of his ship in a circular ring), or when you choose to enter an instanced event/mission/battle area.\n\nCombat involves sailing around and attempting to blast your enemy to bits before he blasts you. Ships have somewhat realistic damage models and can take hits on different sides. Leaks, fires, loss of crew will all act to the detriment of the ship. You manage crew and can select what tasks you want them to focus on. At the moment this is the most complete aspect of the game.\n\nShips and assets can be crafted, but ships may also be captured via boarding (where you manage crew in a rock paper scissors type minigame and attempt to reduce enemy crewcount or morale to 0). Ships sunk will lose a count of durability. Crafted ships will have up to 5 "lives," captured ships or the more powerful first rate ships will only have one.\n\nServers are PvE or PvP (other players may attack you in the overworld). The most active server is PVP1 for the EU.\n\nYou may also attempt to capture ports in special port battles, and secure a port for use by your own nation. Ports have hard hitting artillery fortifications. You will need a group to attack and defend ports.\n\nProgression is centered on the aquisition of experience, money, and assets. You can obtain money and assets through trade, crafting, or combat solo or in a group, and xp through combat.\n\nNations are entities which can take and hold ports. You select a nation at character creation, and nations will act hostile to all but themselves (player driven diplomacy is currentlg the only diplomacy in game). Pirates function like a nation, but can attack other pirates as well.\n\nPvE exists as NPC ships in missions, events, or fleets in the overworld.\n\nThe UI is barebones and there is little to no official documentation or tutorial to the game.\n\nDon't forget that its early access.","February 15","true","58.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The developers are working hard and patches/hotfixes are frequent.\n\nCurrently the UI is placeholder and well below standard, but it's functional at least. The game itself, the ships and the scenery are looking lovely though and it really captures the feeling of being in a sea battle.\n\nThe community tends to be very mature. Use of voice comms is frequent and large clans are organising for massive fleet battles on a daily basis but it's still very possible for you to solo if you are that way inclined. Some work needs to be done to balance the gold income here and there but that'll come in time.\n\nThere is currently next to no help ingame, but there is an unofficial wiki and a help chat channel in which people are more than pleased to provide answers.\n\nOn the whole, I'd wholeheartedly recommend this game as long as people understand that they really are buying a game that is (heavily) in development. I have no doubt that this game will see full release, the developers are excellent and the communication with the community is top notch.\n\nFinally a game that is going to give Early Access a good name.","February 15","true","84.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

For example, you have to navigate properly between locations using just a compass and without your position shown on the map, whilst you have to manually aim your guns in battle (rather than letting the computer do the aiming for you as in other games). You have to learn to read the wind and sail properly (different for each ship) and the difference between a good sailor and a bad one (me!) is significant.\n\nAlthough the game isn't easy at first (and there are no tutorials yet), this brings me onto one of the best facets of the game; the community. I have played more MMOs than I can remember but this is by far the friendliest and most helpful playerbase I have ever seen. Shout out for help or advice and players will quickly reply with what you need to know or sail to help you. I have had players capturing ships and giving them to me and the general chat is fun and interesting. It is common for fleets of players to group-up for hours, conquering ports etc and these times have been genuinely memorable for me.\n\nOnce you have got used to the game, it's simulation nature gives it more depth, more skill and a greater sense of achievement when you get it just right.\n\nGraphics are top-notch: ships are beautifully and accurately modelled whilst the sea and weather effects are stunning. Sound also is good with the whistling of orders given on ships particularly immersive.\n\nAs mentioned before, there are no tutorials in-game (yet), whilst the ui (especially in port) is pretty bare at present. Plenty of features are still being worked on whilst the mechanics of port-battles, boarding and much else are still being developed. Nevertheless, there is already so much good quality content present that I have no hesitation in recommending Naval Action even in early access - you won't be disappointed.\n\nSo, if you have any interest at all in the Age of Sail or warship combat generally, this is an absolutely must-buy game even at this relatively early stage.","January 21","true","441.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"
