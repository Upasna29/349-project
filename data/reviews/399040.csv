The graphics remind me of Lord of the Rings and other medieval fantasy stories.  The gameplay is solid, a good balance beteween not too many cards and not enough to win.  I've played a lot of solitaire games and this ranks up there at the top in my book.\n\nA unique feature in this game is a bonus when you choose cards of matching suits.  The bonus applies to your companions' power ups.  This adds to the strategy because instead of just choosing cards by number you have to decide if you want to match this one to get the suit bonus or match this other one to clear a column.\n\nYou start with one companion, and you get to choose between two different ones.  Along the way other companions will join you  on your journey.  You will have four companions max, one for each card suit.  Some companions are only with you for a little while as they guide you through the terrain, then leave and another companion takes their place.   The companion powers are things like remove a random card, reveal some face-down cards, give you a card that will help match something, etc.\n\nThe gold you get during the game can be used to purchase helpful items.  A sword to clcear away vines; An Axe to chop ice; A Mace to break stone.  Those weapons can only be used 3 times in a row before they break.  So you will be buying more from the store every so often.  There is also a key that locks a stack of cards and you can either buy one from the store or hope you find the hidden one beneath another stack of cards.  Occasionally dragonfire will ignite a card for a few turns.   You can purchase a water potion to douse the flames or just wait for them to go away after several card matches.  In addition to those regular use items there are one-time helpful items that are expensive but worth saving up for, such as the one that gives you an extra undo, or one that reveals more face-down cards.\n\nThe story is narrated by a man, and I think he does a very nice job.  There is a story page in the beginning of each section of the journey.  There are 10 levels of card play in each section.   This game is strictly solitaire card, no hidden object levels or anything like that.\n\nThere are 3 difficulty levels:  easy, normal, and hard.  I played on normal.\n\nThis game is very long, so you definitely get a lot of content for your money. 15 +/- hours for the main story on normal difficulty.  And once you beat the main game you can replay levels or play 3 mini-games including the tri-towers layout, or random layout.","October 3, 2015","true","35.9"," 28 of 29 people (97%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","97","28","29","0","0"

That game was challenging, but a smooth experience to play.\n\nThis plays in a similar manner/rules, but has a lot more muddling it. Random things like a dragons flame, or locks happening, either damning you to not get a perfect (unless you're very lucky with your card draws), or necessitating going into the shop to spend money on a consumable item. It breaks the flow and makes the game frustrating.\n\nIt's not a bad game but it feels like a downgrade--like there was artificial difficulty put in, just for the sake of being hard, rather than more fun.

Probably not.  Would I pay the asking price ($8.99)?  Absolutely not.\n\nWe're all pretty familiar with the way that solitaire works.  The rules for this one -- you have to choose cards that are sequential, not necessarily alternating between red and black suits.  The sequence can move up or down -- for example, when you have a "four" exposed you can either play a three or a five on it.\n\nYou get bonus points for the number of cards you can play in sequence.  You also achieve bonus points for various combinations and permutations.\n\nFor me -- there are so many free versions of solitaire out there that this one isn't necessary.  Yes, there is an overarching plot -- you are a group of fantasy adventurers journeying through the dangerous countryside, fighting orcs and dragons as you go.  But truly the requirements from advancing one level to another are pretty arbitrary.  And anyone who plays solitaire knows that your ultimate success is largely based on luck.\n\nGames based on luck, for me, begin to feel tedious.  Grinding is an unpleasant label you might apply to it.  Listen, I've had my fill of grinding after playing WoW for seven years.  The title "The Insane" was enough to convience me that I was wasting my life on sh*t that didn't matter.\n\nSo I get â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ off at games that essentially become grinding episodes.  The graphics are cool, the sound is passable, and the game enjoyable enough.  It's just that I think that there are plenty of free versions out there that makes me conclude that this one isn't worth spending money on.\n\nAs always, readers should view what I write seen through the lens of the casual gamer -- that is, someone who has limited time due to family, a career, and soul-crushing student loan debt.\n\nSave yourself $9.  Buy your kids some cookies at Target.\n\n","January 10","false","12.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

There are three different card styles to chose from for both the front and back of the cards. You then choose either Hollow Spirit or Merimas Brownlock to guide you. They gather hearts during the game and when fully charged they have the ability to remove one card. Before the start of each level you are given goals to achieve such as making a combo, filling the dragon bar or earning 5 stars. There are bonus cards available, bag of gold, jester wild card, swords, axes etc. There is also a Dragon card which will set a card on fire and that card can't be used until the fire goes out. There are achievements to earn and the gold you earn can be spent in the store to purchase bonus cards, axes, swords, spells, potions and even an extra undo card. Some of the cards will be blocked by locks until you get the key card, vines until you get a sword card, some blocked by ice until you get an axe, and even stone until you get a mace card. To play this game you simply use cards from the board to play a card higher or a card lower onto the foundation card until all the cards on the board have been used. If you cannot use any cards on the board you must draw another card on deck.
