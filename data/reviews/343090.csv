SimpleRockets is effectively a simplified and 2D version of KSP (the dev even says on the store page it's heavily influenced by KSP) so as you would imagine you build spacecraft of all different shapes and sizes and send them on their way into the dark expanse we know as Space. Blast off from Smearth and travel to Smercury, Smars, the Smoon, Smenus, Smupiter, Smaturn, Smuranus and Smeptune.\n\n+Simple graphics, they do look more akin to something you'd find in a flash game but they fit the game well\n+Simple building mechanics, you get a list of parts and they all have highlighted areas to show where they can be attached to other objects\n+Despite being such a simple game you can make some rather complex things as can be seen in the Store page screenshots though I'm not really good enough to make such things\n+Being a simplified version of KSP makes this a useful tool for practising things, particularly orbital mechanics, before trying them in KSP\n+As well as a sandbox mode there are a number of challenges with varying levels of difficulty to try out\n+The controls are great (basically the same as KSP as well which is nice)\n+You can choose what planet to launch from in Sandbox mode which is really cool\n+You can split the screen down the middle, one half displaying your spacecraft and the other half displaying the map of the solar system\n+The plants (and Smoon) all feel very different to each other\n\n-There's not a huge amount of parts available to use but from what I understand the game is easy to mod so perhaps we'll see some mod packs soon\n-The camera centers on the planet and can't be moved which is a little annoying upon re-entry as you often have to watch your rocket descend from an odd point of view\n-Sound effects don't play for anything that isn't attached to your command module, for example if you detatch a stage too early and your rockets are still firing you can't hear them. Not a major issue but something I found irritating\n-Parts only have very brief descriptions giving you a basic idea of what they do but there's no specifications for them\n\nVerdict:\nWorth Purchasing (7.5/10)\n\nSimpleRockets provides a more accesible experience than Kerbal Space Program while maintaining the essence of spacecraft building. If you're a fan of KSP but aren't overly good at it, like myself, chances are you'll enjoy this one.\n\nNo drama, Just Reviews?\n\nEl K.","June 6, 2015","true","3.3"," 81 of 96 people (84%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","84","81","96","11","17"

But don't expect nearly as much depth as KSP.\n\nThey call it SimpleRockets, maybe it should be called VerySimpleRockets.\n\nThe developer says that this game was inspired by Kerbal Space Program, and it does play somewhat like KSP... But it lacks the depth of KSP in more ways than one.\n\nSuch as being 2D-only, only having two dozen or so parts to choose from, lacking most of the happy-go-boom style and atmosphere I am used to in KSP, being limited to miscellanous challenges and a sandbox mode.\n\nIt lacks some conveniences in KSP, such as selecting a part while holding ALT to quickly copy it. I was also annoyed by the behavior of the auto navigation feature - I found it difficult to stop my forcket from rotating, it would wobble left and right of my intended direction.\n\nOn the other hand, it has a realistic model of the solar system. Mod support is listed in the trailer, but I haven't poked around enough to know what to mod.\n\nComplaints aside, it is, in fact, fun. If you don't want to drop $40 on Kerbal Space Program, this game might be a good alternative.","June 3, 2015","true","0.9"," 31 of 42 people (74%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","74","31","42","2","0"

I would recomend it but only if you love space or you want to learn from it. I would rate it at least a 9 / 10 for good physics and realistic calculations.","December 14, 2015","true","42.7"," 16 of 17 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","16","17","0","0"

You can either take on a preset challenge or fly in a sandbox environment. You design your own rocket from preset modules and then fly it! I found the game tremendous fun to play as well as educational on some of the basic principals of flying rockets\n\nLong Review\nThe build screen is a drag and drop affair where modules are dropped onto attach points. There are no resource restrictions so the design of your rocket is limited only by the modules available and your imagination.\n\nThe flight screen is a 2D display of your rocket. You control your rocket by using a segmented bar to select the amount of thrust and a circular slider to select the direction. There is an "action" button to allow you to perform acts like ignite rockets and separate modules. The flight screen can be split in two to also display a map showing your current flight path. The amount of fuel you have remaining is displayed as a progress bar.\n\nThe game plays in full screen or windows mode (although with restricted resolutions) and has a pause button, essential if like me you have a young family who can interupt you at any time! Input is via a mouse.\n\nThere is a good tutorial which takes 5-10 minutes and gave me a good basic understanding of what the game was about.\n\nOnce you have completed the tutorials there are 18 challenges to take on ranging from a simple blast off procedure through reaching a planetary orbit to landing on a moon. Typically a single attempt at a challenge is less than 5 minutes.\n\nHowever, this is the type of game that you need to be a gaming/physics genius to suceed first time on many of the challenges. So be prepared for disaster again and again and again until you find the right design along with the right strategy to succeed. The knock on consequence is that a 5 minute attempt becomes an hour to actually succeed ..\n\nThere is a personal high score table for challenges so you can compare your scores with different designs/strategies and try to keep improving your personal best\n\nThere is also a Sandbox mode where you can pick a planet to build and test your rocket on. The planets are based on our own solar system.\n\nProsThe user interface is extremely easy to use\nSmooth progression through the challenges\nAn easy game to pickup and play a single challenge in one sittingConsNone of the windowed modes fill my 1440x900 screenMarks Out Of 5\n5) Must have - stop whatever you're playing now and play this\n4) Worth the asking price and considering as your next purchase3) Maybe purchase if you're stuck for choosing your next game or mildly discounted\n2) Only purchase if it is heavily discounted\n1) Not worth getting even if given away free\n\nWhere I got the game from\nCoinplay Weekend Bundle 3 [coinplay.io]. The bundle cost me $1 and contains 5 games so technically this game cost me $0.20 (around £0.15) which is just insane value for money\n\nPlatform Played On\nIntel Pentium G3258 Anniversary Edition, 8Gb RAM, Palit GTX 750, Windows 10, Standard Mouse. Played at 1360x768 resolution\n\nMy best guess for a PEGI rating\n3 : I can't see anything in this game to take the rating above 3","October 5, 2015","true","5.6"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","0"

This is probably among my top few favorite games.  I would endorse this without reservation and encourage it for everyone.\n\nAlthough this game couldn't be said to have the best graphics of any space game, I beleive it reasonable to claim that this has some of the best and simplest gameplay of all realistic space games.  It is easiest to learn and has a sprawling potential for the imaginative soul who loves to understand how spaceflight really works.\n\nThis game puts real spaceflight physics (or a reasonable facsimile) into a sidescrolling 2d solar system and allows one to design rocket ships of all sorts and sizes and shapes using components that lock together.  If one builds their rocket ship correctly and it does not explode (a good portion of the pleasure in starting out in the game, as I recall, is building one ship after another and seeing all the things that lead to catastrophic failure and the presumed death of any presumably present pilots in a firey explosion) then one can go into orbit (whatever orbit one choses), fly to other planets or the sun (if one builds enough rocket stages to change one's velocity appropriately) and land on them with parachutes and rockets and sometimes water landings).\n\nThere are in-game instructions for how to manage various feats and there are challenges in the game to keep one interested.  I have completed all but one of those challenges.\n\nThere are mods for this game--at least the non-steam version--but they do not appear to be entirely compatible with the latest update.  I look forward to the possibility of mods for this game through Steam.\n\nI have seen in various updates an improvement in the types of ship components available and I always hope for more to become available.\n\nThis game is endorsed by the website AtomicRockets and I think that is a strong endorsement as they validly criticize so much that is presented as science fiction.  I would endorse this without reservation and encourage it for everyone.\n\nThe planets are out there in this game and only in understanding what it really takes to get to the planets in our solar system can one truly appreciate the value and accomplishment of the real space missions that have been acheived.","June 10, 2015","true","84.6"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","2"

So don't expect the depth of features/parts and graphics of kerbal space program. However in saying that, this game is a lot of fun and basically a light version of KSP. You build rockets, send them into orbit or do whatever you feel like. Make massive monster rockets than take 2 minutes just to lift off the ground, or build moon landers.\n\nThe choice is yours, and as there aren't too many parts you can pick up the basics and get something into orbit straight away.","June 12, 2015","true","3.3"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

However the game also feels like it can't quite reach it's intended goal, as it's just lacking in too many areas. Just to name a few:\n\nthe interface is a little clunky and lacks proper keyboard shortcuts\ndocumentation of rocket parts is lacking\ngamepad support for flying the vehicle doesn't exist\nbackground graphics are flat color gradients and fail to convey a sense of vehicle motion\nthe camera is static and again fails to convey a sense of speed or the forces involved\nmission design is very basic\nlack of Kerbals makes the whole thing feel sterile as there is no personality to it\nIt's overall not a bad game, but it feels more like EarlyAccess then a fully finished product.","August 1, 2015","false","5.4"," 17 of 33 people (52%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","52","17","33","5","0"

I was thinking I would need to repurchase the game to get the steam version, but it appears that is not the case!\n\nAnyhow, to the review. As others have said this is like KSP but in 2D. If you want KSP but your PC is too weak, or if you're not willing to fork out $40 for the game, this is quite a good alternative. While it is lacking in the amount of parts and the variety of parts, there are still many planets and even a comet (Of which there are none in KSP) to land on. You can still build rovers, bases, stations, and landers, which is great considering the games low price point.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Insignus/recommended/343090/","Insignus","Insignus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Insignus/","520 products in account","Simple Rockets is a rather straightforward game, which I picked up for about $8.00 USD during the steam summer sale. A steam port of a mobile game, the game title is quite accurate. You assemble and launch rockets using in a 2D world with a basic physics model and interface. It actively pays homage to KSP, which the author explicitly credits for some inspiration, and the build interface in particular is quite reminiscent of it.\n\nThat said, one should not expect the same level of detail as one would from KSP. There is a limited selection of components, the physics model is quite simple, and the interface is quite barebones, having been designed for use on phones and tablets. Manuever plotting doesn't quite exist, which can make it somewhat hit or miss. The upside, however, is that it is simple enough to get into, and there is no resource, part, or limits other the physics themselves, so messing up a launch won't set you back anything other than time.\n\nWhich is part of the fun, after all, watching your contraptions randomly explode into a billion pieces. It does come with some missions, but they are mostly for training and orientation. The sandbox mode is a welcome departure rom KSP, in that it allows you to build and launch from any planet.\n\nIt could use some additional polish, however that may not be plausible unless the developer is willing to make a PC only game version. In addition to aforementioned manuever plotting, the game currently lacksmany components, and adding RCS components to your vehicles can be a pain as there is no way to show the center of gravity for vehicles. The lack of these features doesn't detract from the game or its pricetag, however, so you can get by without them.\n\nOverall, I would give this game a 7.5 out of 10, rating it as a good way to play away an afternoon, thus passing the movie ticket test.","June 19, 2015","true","6.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The controls, maps, and building are all a bit awkward, and dont act exactly how they should. Its really just an IOS game, and it would be kind of fun to play on the bus on your phone.\n\nThat being said this game has potential, its not a bad game in anyway. I really only see it as being worth $3-5 for whats in it current, and what you get compared to KSP.","June 24, 2015","true","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

UGH. But I shouldn't blame this game for it, because it's either an ancient, foreign computer (which I'm using) that's tripping Steam up or that Steam was inadvertently designed to appear attacked by the games it runs to AVG, which stops the games. I did play it on a relative's computer, and I had fun launching rockets. Most of which tipped over and blew up, ran out of fuel before orbit and crashed and blew up, or landed on the moon... much to fast and blew up. I did get an ion engine craft into earth orbit, and then out of earth orbit. I suppose I'm still inexperienced with the game, although all the blowing up was sorta fun.","May 31","true","2.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
