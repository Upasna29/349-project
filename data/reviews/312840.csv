I've also finished the game and there are no substantial issues with the game, or any real changes outside of the fact that the stealth sections have paths on the minimap showing you where to go now in order to make them easier. The game's last moments still leave a bit to be desired, but the majority of the story is good enough that I would definitely recommend this.\n\nAs a word of warning, at the moment this game seems to save your game based on your steam name. What this means is that changing your name causes the game to forget where your save is, and if you have any quotation marks, question marks, or any punctuation that isn't allowed in a windows folder name, the game just freezes after you choose your language at the start.\n\nI haven't played the game past the opening yet, but I finished the original Indigo Prophecy and the original Fahrenheit release from GOG and assuming they haven't broke anything it's a great game aside from the ending so I'll leave the recommendation at a yes anyways.","January 28, 2015","true","2.3"," 521 of 642 people (81%) found this review helpful 35 people found this review funny","81","521","642","35","12"

Combine it with a terrific thriller to get Fahrenheit: a horrendous video game hiding a great cinematic experience.\n\nLong version:When it came out in 2005, Fahrenheit offered something new by focusing exclusively on the narrative and nothing else. It was a true interactive movie with cinematic techniques like split scenes displaying the same events from multiple points of view (like in the TV show ‘24’).\n\nThe plot is entirely character-driven and focuses on three main leads: Lukas, a murderer on the run; and Carla and Tyler, the two detectives on his trail. Their stories are split into more than thirty chapters on two separate threads that eventually meet in one big finale.\nA finale about superpowers, Mayan prophecies, an artificial intelligence, and somehow preventing the freezing of the planet with a martial arts showdown against an immortal priest. If you thought the end of Matrix: Revolutions jumped the rails, it has nothing on this game.\n\nSadly the derailment of the plot is vastly overshadowed by gameplay issues. The controls are horrid, no matter what control scheme you choose: for example, basic actions like picking up something require at least four-five mouse or stick gestures with bad movement detection. The few puzzles make absolutely no sense, and all key scenes are progressed by playing a double quick-time event that obstructs the entire screen. By the way, on easy mode, this minigame leaves roughly a quarter of a second window for each action before failing.\n\nI have no doubts that Fahrenheit was one of the best things ever in its time, but it aged horribly. If you missed it originally, you are far better off just watching a longplay than trying to suffer through its controls.","October 24, 2015","true","14.8"," 158 of 205 people (77%) found this review helpful 21 people found this review funny","77","158","205","21","14"

Yes they have done quite lot of works but remember this is a game from 2005 and originally released on PS2. Of course you can switch between HD and SD version by pressing F9.\n\nI got a copy of Fahrenheit: Indigo Prophecy (GOG version, uncut and SD only) a long time ago and I'm so happy that it's been remastered, as well as released on Steam recently. The gameplay is story-oriented. Which means, if you're into fast-paced, high speed action or even sparking RPGs, then this is not what you're looking for.\n\nThe best word to describe this game is "interactive movie". Everything you do may affect the storyline, which then leads to different endings. Even if you chose a "wrong" route, the game still refers to a conclusion (and yes you can restart from last checkpoint after all).\n\nPros:\n+ Awesome story line, with different endings based on choices made by the player. No, it's not simple to describe the whole story within some paragraphs here.\n+ Great voice actors.\n+ Well-done remastered version with controller support, Mac+PC ports.\n+ Uncut version (yeah, there're sex scenes in game).\n+ Cheap (got this when it was 75% off on Nuuvem, about ~$1.89).\n\nCons:\n+ Annoying quick-time events. They're based on PS2 control scheme.

Cool set of characters, a nice setting, mystery, good music and everything else you would want from this kind of adventure game.

The game turns into some kind of cheap action movie, the plot becomes absurd and you won't believe in your eyes. Did I smoke something?\n\nIndigo Prophecy is one of those games I just can't explain, you have to play by yourself.

If so, you should like that game. Fahrenheit Indigo Prophecy is a point-and-click adventure in which you control Lucas Kane, a guy who wakes up in the toilet of a restaurant with a knife in his hand .. and a body on the ground just next to him ! Also, you control two other characters, the two cops that are in charge of the investigation for this murder.\n\nFirst of all, the gameplay. It plays like a regular point-and click adventure game but an important part of the game is the cutscenes . The problem is that in some of these cutscenes, you have to do QTEs (Quick Time Events) in the form of 'Simon Says' with 2 pad of 4 arrows. Sometimes, it's just useless since there is no action at all and it's distracting. Some other times, it might be too hard and unforgiving for some people (I had no problem with that but read a lot of bad comments about that). The game is quite easy. You won't be stuck anywhere since the characters always tell what to do.\n\nMy favorite part of the game was the story. Really interesting story. It starts out as a thriller. Why did Lucas did that? Why did he mutilated himself in the toilet before commiting the murder? Why doesn't he remember? There's a lot of questions that are answered later in the game and I won,t spoil anything. It's better that way. I had no idea what this game was about and was pleasantly surprised at the end. There is also different endings depending of the different choices that you make during the game !\n\nAnother really good thing about this game is the voice acting. It sounds like a movie and it's definitely a good point. In French (don't know about the English voices), the voice-over is perfect and really intriguing. The music is really great too. It's mysterious and it adds up to the atmosphere of the game (and you can buy some good songs with bonus points in the 'bonus' section !)\n\nLast thing that I really liked was the camera angles throughout the game. Sometimes, you'll see 3-4 views at the same time to show more informations of where the people are or where to go next. Really fun and useful !\n\nIn conclusion, if you don't mind about the QTEs, get this game. The story is amazing, the writing is engaging and you'll definitely want to know what happened. Also, it's long enough to be well worth the price of the game (Took me 6 hours to complete it)","June 21, 2015","true","5.9"," 51 of 69 people (74%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","74","51","69","3","1"

Remastered in this case means visual improvements that are not really vital.\n\nFahrenheit is about an ordinary guy who's been randomly chosen to do unusual things, involving very much the whole world. Not only that you'll play as this super natural hero, there are two other main characters that you'll control and making choices between all three of them is really fun. You feel like you can really influence everything that happens although the reality is of couse different since the game can't possibly have more than a few multiple endings at a time for only 10€. Some people critisize this game for going a little crazy after the first half but I believe, that's the way it was meant to go and against all odds I enjoyed the crap out of it. The action scenes are very comfortable with both keybord and controllers, maybe a little more with the analog sticks than arrows. I loved the older version and wanted to support the devs even now that it's returned to Steam, either way it's getting 9/10 from me.\n\nFahrenheit is the reason I began to love and hate QuanticDream at the same time. I love them dearly for making awesome games that make you feel like your choices matter and the way the stories are told.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sfarmer89/recommended/312840/","sfarmer89","sef","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sfarmer89/","74 products in account","Fun fact: I played this game way back in the day when it originally came out on the PS2. Back then I knew it as “Indigo Prophecy”, and my teenage self was intrigued by its emphasis on cinematics and interactive storytelling, so I rented it for a weekend. I didn’t finish it during that rental period, and needless to say, I didn’t rent it a second time. The game’s story was just too weird. I think it was about the time that the main character began developing superpowers that I decided to let Blockbuster keep this one. So, ten years later and here I am playing this game again. Ten years older, ten years wiser… I’ve aged pretty well. Can the same be said for Fahrenheit?\n\nThe game gets off to a bad start when I’m greeted by French menus. This isn’t a big deal, but it’s a weird, lazy oversight, and it sets the tone for what’s to come. It’s especially weird considering this is supposed to be the “definitive” remastered edition of the game, but it just ends up feeling like a lazy port of a previous PC release. It does feature some updated textures for the new HD resolutions, but I honestly could barely tell any difference. Also, in another weird, lazy oversight, the game mode that features HD textures is actually the one with the old, low-res text and menus. I don’t know how the developers in charge of the port messed that one up. Anyway, after switching to English, I’m quickly reminded of director David Cage’s quest to create “interactive film” when, instead of “New Game” being an option on the main menu, there’s instead the option for “New Movie”. This, coupled with the game’s tutorial consisting of an in-game, low-poly version of Cage himself in a virtual movie set “directing” me, the player, through the game’s controls and promising a world where “anything can happen” creates an annoyingly pretentious vibe. Why must Cage remind me at every turn that this is an interactive movie? Can’t the product just speak for itself? Shouldn’t a game, or an interactive story, or whatever you choose to call it stand on its own as an experience instead of relying on the strengths of another medium?\n\nI have to admit that I do like the game’s engine and core gameplay, though. Quantic Dream came up with a pretty good control scheme and game mechanics for a title focused on storytelling. Interacting with the environment and selecting dialogue choices is all done with the right stick or the mouse pointer, which is both intuitive and immersive. Holding left to slide open a closet door to the left, for instance, feels natural, and actions that require holding a direction longer, like turning on a light, do a good job of putting the player in the character’s shoes. It’s simple, but it works. With this engine you could conceivably tell any film-like story interactively, with quick-time events provided for action sequences or scenes in which characters must exert themselves physically. The characters are also all well-animated due to extensive motion capture, and are generally well-voice acted. David Gasman in particular gives a grounded, believable performance as main character Lucas, which is actually saying a lot given the ridiculous material.\n\nThat’s really where the problem lies. Despite the game functioning fairly well and providing a good system for telling an interactive story, the story itself is, ironically, the game’s downfall. It’s just poorly conceived. Cage is ok with dialogue and basic character emotions and relationships, but for some reason he isn’t content with just telling character driven stories. Fahrenheit is full of supernatural nonsense that only serves to alienate the player from any connection they might have felt to the characters. Full disclosure: I still haven’t finished the game, even after writing this review. I honestly can’t bring myself to; it’s such an unenjoyable experience. As a kid I stopped when Lucas developed superpowers; this time I couldn’t make it past the giant termites. I wish I were making that sentence up. Every now and then I will indeed feel as though I’m in the shoes of a character, making dramatic decisions with consequence in the film of their lives. I like the scene where Lucas’s estranged brother Markus gives him a call. It’s legitimately dramatic and interesting, and then it’s immediately ruined when Lucas tries to explain that he only committed a murder because of some magic mumbo jumbo. I instantly stopped caring. The vast majority of the time spent playing Fahrenheit feels like this; it feels like playing a stupid video game.  A poorly written one that takes itself too seriously and comes across as pretentious for it. I find this quote from Cage extremely ironic and extremely telling:\n\n“During development, I discovered that this everyday facet of the characters was in fact the most interesting aspect of the game—much more than the supernatural side.”\n\nWhy couldn’t the game have just been full of moments like this, like the phone call between brothers who haven’t seen each other in years? Simple, relatable moments between real people with real problems.\n\nBecause of this I can’t really recommend Fahrenheit, even to fans of the adventure genre, except as maybe a historical curiosity. In the end, Fahrenheit is an admittedly ambitious, but extremely flawed and ultimately unenjoyable experience. It is interesting to see some of the strides it made, and its lineage can indeed be seen in modern adventure games like The Walking Dead, but in a genre that’s all about storytelling, and with a story as uneven and poorly-executed as this one, you may as well just watch a real movie instead of this cheap virtual knock-off. Fahrenheit: Indigo Prophecy Remastered is the pretentious poeticals of a college freshman.","February 14, 2015","false","4.9"," 52 of 75 people (69%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","69","52","75","7","0"

I loved the concept of the game - you're a man who has murdered someone but who was not in control of his actions and you must find out who or what has done this to you. Meanwhile, the police (who you also play the game as) are hot on your trail. Will you figure out the mystery before the police catch up to you? It's all pretty exciting...though recently I bought the game again, however, played through it twice in a row and began to realize how completely full of plot holes it is and how certain decisions that the writer of this game chose just don't make any sense at all. Luckily, it's pretty short - after two playthroughs I've only clocked in about 16 hours.\n\nIf you're not a fan of quick time events, you definitely won't like this game, since that is all the game uses in order to proceed. There are QTE's for fighting, QTE's for talking, QTE's for damn near anything.

Not in a performance or visual way but in its overall feeling or vibe. You can use gamepad or mouse and keyboard, typically I don't bother to bring this subject up but other than the obvious differences. The game actually plays quite differently. As in you have direct analog control with a gamepad and should you choose to play with mouse and keyboard (as I did) You will be greeted with tank controls. Which can be a bit jarring when camera control is taken away from you and to the games credit it when it is taken away the camera seems to direct you in very helpful ways as to not get you lost but does indeed take some getting used to try and find your roots again with tank controls.\n\nThe game has this feeling of Resident Evil mixed with Eternal Darkness. Both because the general horror nature of the game and Eternal Darkness because there is a mechanic in which you must monitor your every action as it effects the mental fortitude of the player character.\n\nYou play as 1 of 3 characters. Lucas Kane, Carla Valenti, or Tyler Miles. You switch in between them after their specific sequence is over. In the beginning it feels a bit odd. As if you are being forced to take a side. As you probably know, its in the trailer, it happens in the first 5 minutes, this game is old; its not a spoiler but Lucas Kane murders a man in a bathroom. Carla and Tyler are the detectives assigned to the case. So right from the very get go you are given subtle clues as to which side you wish  take as well as have plenty of character moments. This is a David Cage game after all and every little decision means something down the line.\n\nThe main interaction with the game is walking around and finding clues or talking with people. Action sequences are either directional quicktime events, a sort fake simon says game or a test of endurance by pressing left and right a bunch. There is also a couple of sequences which I didn't find very enjoyable and tested my patience quite a bit. Without saying anything explicit, it involved moving very slowly, regulating your breath and searching for a clue relevant to the situation.\n\nThere is also some VERY strange sequences with licensed music. Specifically with the band “Theory of a Deadman”, a band I listened to in High School. It felt very strange, maybe a little forced but in all honesty is wasn't the first time the game started to feel a bit campy and stop taking itself so seriously.\n\nTHE GIST\nFahrenheit: Indigo Prophecy is a very good adventure game, though in all honesty my ending did not feel very satisfying. The story goes places I never would have guessed and in my story one character had a very dramatic change of character that felt incredibly forced as if it was just something people expected from a blockbuster film. It made zero sense and I'm completely baffled by it. However its more a of a sub plot thing even though its alluded to as otherwise.\n\nVery old feeling adventure game but with some modern convenience. Sort of tows the line between nostalgia and something that telltale might do. Voice acting is well done but some of the sequences repeat if you ask too many questions I couldn't tell if it was a bug or just to reiterate things so you didn't forget them.\n\nThe games has some problems but the story is engaging and the characters are rather interesting so the small issues it does have can be overlooked.","May 26","true","8.2"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

I found this to be an immersive supernatural thriller, introducing Quantic Dream's unique brand of "interactive movie" gameplay that they do so well.\n\nThere's an overall cinematic feel to Fahrenheit that lends a unique atmosphere to the presentation. This is evident from the very beginning, which is probably one of the best opening scenes (not better than Silent Hill 2 though).\n- regarding the story (no spoilers), it's a psychological thriller that, as it progresses, takes on more and more over-the-top supernatural elements. I think many would be turned off by the far-fetched twists and turns that the plot takes, but I really liked it and was hooked till the end.\n- Gameplay is a mixture of moving around like the known adventure games, look around for stuff to interact with and doing many QTE (Quick Time Events) which kinda looks like the old toy (Simon) where you have to follow the lights sequences and push the buttons in the direction of the lights. also, it has the "choose your own adventure" style of dialogue (several conversation options at select points  (you're asked to pick one quickly to determine where it goes from there). sometimes if you fail you will die and have to restart the sequence.\n\n- The graphics of course looks really dated (kinda similar to Max Payne graphics). while it isn't the remaster i was hoping for it is still better than the original and much better than the PS2 version. the price is fair i think. i even saw the option to play it at 4K but my screen is only 1080p so i went with that. but no matter what resolution you use the textures aren't gonna improve much, I highly recommend playing it with a controller (Xbox 360 or xbox1 controllers works perfectly).\n\n- I really have huge respect for Quantic Dream, they took big risks in making this and their later games in a way that won't appeal to everyone and won't sell like other AAA games but are great and unique none the less.\n\n- The port ran fine for me so far except one scene in the office where all characters vanished and i was just hearing voices then the game froze and crashed, other than that one instance eveything went fine and dandy.\n\n- Small note to the developer, it would be better if i could highlight the resolution i want then click apply than having the screen flashing on me while scrolling through resolution options.","January 29, 2015","true","8.0"," 103 of 184 people (56%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","56","103","184","11","6"

And I must say that I still do. Well, at least about 3/4 of it. Those 3/4 are still simply amazing. It starts with what is probably the greatest opening I've ever seen in a video game, continues with you trying to figure out what happened from both sides of the fence ('cause you get to play different people's timelines) and ends... ah yes the ending...\nIn my opinion, the ending is more than disappointing. It's full of reeeeaaaally poor design and writing choices (  ♥♥♥♥ing superpowers, flying, running along walls, suddenly appearing AIs that are trying to take over the world, an extremely unnecessary romance which pinpoints the illogical character development and a really anticlimactic finale  ) which ruin pretty much everything that you worked for the entire game. Because when you find out what's going on you just wish you hadn't.\nNevertheless, remembering the mentioned first 3/4, I still have to give this game a thumbs up. Not just because I loved it 10 years ago, but because the story still ties me to my chair. There's apparently a lot of thought behind the whole story, and maybe the ending is simply not to my taste. Maybe someone else loves it, who knows?\n\nDespite my disappointment towards the end, I would recommend this game to pretty much everyone who is into story-based adventure games and hasn't yet played it, and if you have played it, just grab that sweet feeling of nostalgia on sale.\n\nP.S.: If anyone of you guys actually liked the ending please comment, I'd really like to know why :P","May 11","true","7.4"," 13 of 17 people (76%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","76","13","17","3","6"

You can't fault the game for being how it was designed years ago. I think Aspyr did a great job on polishing up the graphics for what they were (High Definition != High Detail!!!).  The sound seems to crackle a little in-game, noticeable in cutscenes or the main menu. The game has a great and weird story to it. The one thing that kills me, is the "DDR-Like" button quick time events. These use the Joystick, and if you know your Linux, Xbox 360 controllers can be hit or miss depending on the implementation. During the ...SPOILERS?......"Office Survival" QTE sequence, I was extremely frustrated do the the Xbox 360 controller's tendency to fling its resting "center" to the far right, which made some QTE actions register wrong. And when this sequence is as fast paced and forgiving as this one, it makes you angry. Play this one using a PS3 controller (USB or Bluetooth). You'll thank me later.\n\nPros:\nOverall the game has a nice opening, and a very nice detective feel to it. The soundtrack is very good and the characters do get their fair bit of attention each in the character development department. The "mood" meter is a nice addition to the gameplay, and it forces you to carefully evaluation your actions and responses to conversations. The character models are ok, given the time this came out, and the games budget at that time of it's original release.\n\nCons:\nThe quick time event system is frustrating as can be. I soon lamented every "Get Ready" moment, especially when the game was unforgiving enough not to allow me collect enough "lives" to live through the tougher parts of the game (which I beat with one life..oi vey). Seriously, if you cannot tolerate QTE's whatsoever, this game will drive you mad. Furthermore, clunky movements, accelerated by the very odd "action" system (where in you push the joystick to do things), make it even worse. Many times, the center positioning of my gamepad lost it's way, forcing me to switch to a PS3 controller from an Xbox 360, due to the better axis precision. No other game I own on SteamOS / Linux / Windows does this.\n\nThe graphics were polished up decently enough for what the original game was, but there could have been more done. This is likely understandable given the team's budget. The story near the end takes a very odd turn, with some of the dialogue leaving you quite confused.\n\nThis remaster is most certainly for fans of the original, and it definitely teeters on the edge of Yes/No for a recommendation here. I'd say, if you can stomach the QTE's and wonky controls, give it  try.","February 15, 2015","false","13.0"," 15 of 24 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","15","24","0","1"

Now with HD Textures\n-The first half of the game is tense, interesting and has a nice mystery atmosphere.\n- English Voice-actors are doing an awesome job\n- It is a very unique experience\n\nThe Bad:\n- The HD Textures can look a bit out of place\n- In the second half/last third the game falls completely apart:\n--The Story becomes an insane mess with deus ex machinas,\n--Characters have information out of nowhere as if stuff was cut out,\n--and a complete change of tone. The QTEs become absurdly long and all the really nice "puzzles" from the beginning\nare gone.\n\nSo what to do?\nYou kinda have to play this. The first half to see what you can do with David Cages Idea of Games. How interesting and working his concept is. And the second half you just have to see. It's fascinating to watch something become so absolutely stupid and over the top. It's "bad sonic fan-fiction" absurd. it's like if "Se7en" would have ended with a big DBZ Style fight between the main characters and 2 more characters who just came up in the last 5 minutes.\n\nSo buy it, enjoy the first half of the game and laugh at the second half.\n\nAnd for the germans here who want to play it in german:\nDO NOT DO IT!

I remember playing this game when it was released and thinking it was innovative and amazing. It's story had depth and its cinematic visual style was new and exciting to see in a video game. However, it has not aged well. I was able to get through the game again on pure nostaglia. The QTEs are cumbersome and intrusive as they prevent you from actually seeing what's happening due to all your concentration being on the Simon mini game or manically mashing your A and D keys. Aside from that, every damn action requires you to move your mouse in some kind of pattern. Everything. Want to take a drink of milk? 1)Move mouse up to open fride. 2)Move mouse left to take milk. 3)Move mouse left to drink milk. 4)Move mouse right to put milk down. 5)Move mouse down to close fridge. My. God. Plus, I don't know if this is because I'm just older, but there are things that some of the characters do in the game that makes it incredibly difficult to suspend my disbelief as well as set pieces that just make no sense (why is my bathroom as large as my bedroom and how the hell can I afford a place like this in New York?!) Look, bottom line is, if you have never played this game before, despite what I just said, I do in fact recommend it for the story and the experience.

It couldn't compete graphically with many of the AAA titles of that time, and the gameplay was something the industry hadn't seen before. At best, it was a neat experiment that (critically) fell short of greatness. The story felt like a sped-up version of Lost. Engaging, exciting and mysterious at the start, with a ridiculous theological (or in this case science fiction-y) ramp-up approaching the end. Because of the game's strict adherence to its "dynamic story" feature, oftentimes your play-through would result in not enough information or justification for the ridiculous plot points. The only way to get the full picture was to play the game <em>perfectly</em>. While that wasn't particularly difficult, it did require subsequent runs through the game, which is a clumsy way of providing a satisfying conclusion.\n\nThe new HD remaster, by definition, addresses none of those issues apart from the graphical fidelity. As with my REmaster Review, it is unfair to rate the game based upon story or gameplay elements ten years after the fact, so this review will cover how well the developer remastered and ported their game to PC, Mac and Linux.\n\nGraphical Upscaling:\n\nWhere other remastered games add things like newly rendered cutscenes, character models, environmental or weather effects, light bloom, dynamic lighting or increased particle count, Indigo Prophecy Remastered does nothing of the sort. Visually, the new version is almost unrecognizable as a different game. The only noticeable differences are that it runs at a solid 60-ish frames per second (which </strong>is</strong> a huge leap from the PS2/Xbox era) and the "film of standard definition" has been wiped from the screen; it's no longer blurry or fuzzy. Object outlines are clear and concise, the snow particles don't make traversing the street segments a chore, and it is now easier than ever to spot clues or interactive elements. While that certainly makes the game more playable, it doesn't match up to other more intensive remasters.\n\nRead the full review at http://casualsgaming.com/2015/02/16/indigo-prophecy-review/","May 18, 2015","true","0.8"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Keeping this in mind, this is a review of the remaster as if the original did not exist. The first thing to be noted is the texture work. While impressive for 2005, the "HD" remaster is only a small refinement on the original.\n\nOverall, the gameplay is far from inspired with most of the play revolving around controlling clucky characters and battling annoying and repetetive QTEs. There are times when Farenheit attempts to act as a game, but this is when it truely falls apart. The stealth section is poorly writen and overall frustrating without any real satisfaction in the end. The greatest failure of the stealth level is an entire lack of feedback given to a player, instead giving an arbitrary "Game Over" screen, not even indicating who spotted you.\n\nThe only redeeming element of this "interactive movie" is the story itself which holds a certain amount of interest. However the story does little to combat the gameplay.  Afterall, the story could have well fit into a 2 hour movie, yet was stretched into a  7-9 hour game. The amount of fluff is painful, with one section being nothing but lifting weights in a gym.\n\nPerhaps this game has some value in a historical context, but unless you are doing so out of academic interest, it is best to avoid it.","January 31, 2015","false","8.2"," 139 of 265 people (52%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","52","139","265","8","5"

I'm surprised that the sex scene didn't have QTE included.\n\nThe first half of the game is the best part: the setting for the mystery is very well put and there are actually some really good point and click elements going on. I was loving Lucas' psychic abilities to gather intel to make better conversation choices or actions, and even the work of the investigators was a pleasure to follow when they tried to reason the weird crime circumstances. But then the storytelling decides to focus on completely unrelated happenings that really drag the flow, like playing guitar, basketball, or boxing sparring. All these actions are just repetitive quicktime events, there's no reason to spend several minutes of minigames on those parts, just a simple cutscene would have done the trick.\n\nThere are also issues with controls and the camera, but those are relatively minor because of the genre. The main issue is the inconsistent storytelling, I really, really wanted more from the story itself, and got very frustrated when I was forced to do some inrelated actions, and the ending gets rushed because of that. And please, if you decide to create a branching storyline, make it split in some other ways rather than succeeding/failing in lenghty QTE events. Any other system would do, depending on your karma, character relationships, discussion choises or anything.\n\nThis game is one of the pioneers of visual storytelling, and I respect it for that, but by today's standards it has outdated really bad.  I feel like the developers had the full focus on the story and directing, but didn't have a clue how to make it work as a game, and they tried to include all kinds of elements that were either slapped on the story (pointless QTE during a normal cutscene) or ended up being almost completely unrelated to anything.

Multiple storylines with endless possibilities on how the story plays out, you really feel like every decision you make will alter the future gameplay and story, and for the most part, that's true.\n\nThe controls to me are just fine, tank controls for movement and utilizing the WASD and arrow keys for the "action" sequences. Outside of action sequences you use your mouse (or controller is that's what you prefer) to interact with the world around you.\n\nBack to the topic of the action sequences, so far they have all been in very appropiate places in the storyline I am going through and they have a nice balance between it being severely difficult to simon says for kids.\n\nAs big as the game might seem from the looks of it, it's actually quite linear, it's mainly the dialogue options that give you the diversity of your story, as well as what actions you did, and when, and how, and in what order. There feels to be a lot to this game and I can't wait to make it to the end and replay it in a tottaly new way, I'm ashamed to have ignored this game as long as I have.\n\nAlso this port works superb for me. Have not had a single crash or any problem with the game it self at all. Runs smooth and is definitely a joy to play, it even makes me feel better to have taken advantage of the summer sale deal on it and bought it for only 5 dollers, it's definitely a good investment to consider since if you at all enjoy adventure games, story driven games, games like "Heavy Rain", then you will like this game.\n\nThe only reason I can see someone not liking the game is if you don't enjoy single player, stories, tank controls, or thought processing.\n\nEDIT (9/27/15): Just beat the game for the first time, it was quite an experience, I still feel the same way as I had written before, absolutely great game, with a great story. I look forward to playing it again sometime from now, and make some different major choices than I hadn't decided to go with.\n\nAbsolutely great.","June 14, 2015","true","11.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

(Minus the follow situation: Later in the game a character suddenly, and for no conceivable reason, develops feelings for another person. While I could see the character feeling an attraction towards the other person, and I could see how the situation may well change a person's outlook, I found it totally out of character for this person to express their love for said character. Worse, there is actually a naked sex scene in minus 50 degree weather!\n\nThe narrative David Cage spins is a mash-up of old science fiction and fantasy tropes rather than anything new or original.\nGameplay is a mess. The camera is atrocious and an over reliance on quick time events leaves the gameplay feeling rather shallow.\n\nArt direction, backgrounds, and character models are nice, as is the games soundtrack.\n\nDespite all the negativity, I do actually like this game. I just wish the story made more sense and that the right thumbstick was reserved for the free movement of the game's camera.\n\nIf my review hqasn't put you off from trying this game and you later find yourself sharing similar views to me, then I would suggest giving Heavy Rain a go.

It explores how we're all trapped in stressful and unhealthy lifestyles and opens up to the idea of other dimensions and Mayan lore.\n\nExploration is encouraged to develop your understanding and lore of the characters and some moral dilemas will leave your compass spinning like a hooker in an orgy.\n\nOnly real complaint is the superfluous QTEs and the intensity of them.

Влипнуть и пройти в один присест как в старые-добрые в этот раз правда не вышло, но все же.\n\nЕсть в этой игре все-таки какое то сердце, несмотря на всякое-превсякое намудренное в финале.\n\nВ ней единственной из трех пройденных мной игр QD (омикрон пока не трогал) нормальные интересные персонажи. Они тут не куча СТРАДАЮЩИХ статистов из HR и не Элен "две эмоции - почти-рыдаю и рыдаю" Пейдж из позорного беенда. Тут у главных действующих лиц хотя бы есть харизма и они не проводят всю игру в режиме даже-в-зеркало-себе-не-улыбаюсь-оттого-что-серьезный-такой. Особенно радует очароваха и лапа Карла Валенти.\n\nВ фаренгейте Кейдж еще не возомнил себя мастером социального комментария и в этой игре его (комментария) ,слава богу, почти нет. Потому что пишет на серьезные темы Кейдж отвратительней всех в индустрии, по моему мнению. Тут же героев не пытаются насиловать каждые пять минут злые-бессердечные-люди, копы тут не работают с коррумпированными подонками, а детство у действующих лиц не повально беспросветно-блеклое. Игра не воспринимает себя шибко серьезно и от этого выигрывает. Когда ВНЕЗАПНО вылезают интернет-роботы и прочая чертовщина эта несерьезность очень помогает весь этот беспредел терпеть. Ну и персонажи все же тащат, можно сказать вопреки.\n\nВ общем, первоначальный вау-эффект конечно повыветрился, сейчас есть куда более талантливые интерактивные фильмы, но уютного B-очарования у этой игры все же не отнять.\n\nНу и надо все таки этой игре сказать спасибо за жанр в том виде в котором он есть сейчас.\n\nИ еще музыка там клевая","March 1","true","9.6"," 9 of 16 people (56%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","56","9","16","2","0"

While I was always interested in the game, the storyline and the atmosphere, I've never bothered to continue my journey into it. I was too poor and lazy to afford another copy.\nActually, I do have to admit that remakes allow people like me - those who didn't bother to buy into something at the time - or fresh gamers to experience goodies from the past. It's just that I'm not okay with giving that much amount of money to a company which does not care at all how their final product turns out. The thought alone that some people acquired the rights to publish Indigo Prophecy in 1080p glory, did a poor job at updating the graphics and added mind-blowing controller support (which isn't needed, at all, but a nice extra) and are charging 9 € for it is quite disturbing. Those guys didn't do jack-♥♥♥♥ for that game and are cashing in dem Dollars and Monopoly Monies.\nThat's the problem with all those new old games. People don't give a ♥♥♥♥, in most cases. They just want to make money.\n\nBuuuut besides that, Fahrenheit does not deliver the experience I expected it would deliver. Just look behind the qtes, that's the least offender. Personally, I can enjoy a video game if it delivers on some levels - eg story, artstyle, music, you name it. Problem is, the story of this game starts of really promising, only to show you one big middle finger after half of it. Seriously, don't even bother. I admit that I had fun for the first 2 hours, really, but everything after that is just one big disappointing mess of bad and unambitious writing. The godawful quick time events make matters worse.\n\nDon't invest your money in this. Buy 2 packs of cigarettes, get some cheap vodka and have a buzz, have some Wendy's, anything.

With it being an old game it might put people off of playing, but it shouldn't as they would be missing out.\n\nThe story is amazing. The different characters all are handled great, and with each event affecting their sanity, it creates tension within the game as you don't know how each event will affect the character you are controlling. The only thing with the story is that the ending confused me (I got the good ending), Lucas is dead, yet he can live with his wife (at least he calls her his wife, I'm not sure if that has happened yet) and soon to be child? How can she see him if he is dead? How can he create a child when he isn't living? It is obvious he is dead since his skin is ice cold, so how is that even possible? The cyborg said something about reviving him, they said they couldn't and he was dead, so that pretty much confirmed it. Other than that I think the story is perfect, the mix of supernatural elements is a great touch and makes it interesting.\n\nThe QTE moments can be rather tedious/annoying/hard at times, especially the rapid tapping of left and right movement keys (I almost failed to get a good ending just because I almost didn't reach the blue part on the bar at one certain moment), but the overall control scheme is fine in my opinion.\n\nThe remaster did wonders to the graphics of the game, it looks amazing for how old it actually is. I wasn't able to switch to the SD version to compare because it seemed to crash when I tried, but I didn't mind. Although the game seems to tab out now and again (after an hour or two of playing), and this usually happened in a QTE moment so I missed it and just restarted the game altogether to avoid ruining my playthrough, and to avoid it happening again not too long after.\n\nOverall it's an amazing game and it is worth the money in my opinion.

In 2005 this game was amazing. Is it now? Well..yes. It is.\n\nThe visuals are a little dated but they're still really good for what they are.\nThe gameplay is a mix of free-movement and QTE's but they're done in a way that don't become immediately boring. You can even crank up the difficulty of the QTE's or even tone them down [if you're wanting to play it simply for story]\nThe story? Damn it's crazy. It's a supernatural murder-mystery with emphasis on the characters. Not just character development but managing a characters feelings, stress and things like that.\nThe puzzles are great but what makes it unique is how you handle them. The best way to explain this is a particular part of the story where you're supposed to composite a sketch of the murderer. If you do it right then it will depress your murderer and make it harder to play as him. If you do the sketch wrong then it'll depress the investigators and make it harder for them. It's a real risk-reward system that I adore.\n\n\nThat all sounds positive, right? Well..there's issues.\nA lot of people are reporting getting a black screen and issues even setting the game up. In my case I literally have to spam enter when I boot it up and then I've got to go through a set of menu's in French [I don't speak French so it's not fun].\nI've even got a couple of friends that have said flat out that this won't run because of the issues. The Dev's know of the issue and I've come across forums where they've admitted they don't even know what's causing the issue.\n\n\nAll in all, I think this is great. I loved it 10 years ago and I love it today.\nAlso make sure you use a controller.\n\nAlso David Cage is in this game and he can't pronounce English and it's kinda hilarious :')","December 1, 2015","true","6.1"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

HOWEVER, playing with keyboard controls, the interface is clumsy, and while there may be a few out there with superhumanly fast reflexes who can do it, the special actions with the two-handed "Simon Game" type control seems to be impossible no matter how many times one tries.  Even on the "easy" setting, by my clock, you have about 1/15 seconds to respond by hitting one of four keys with your left hand and one of a different four with your right... in brief, literally the blink of an eye.  Maybe the game was designed for a slower processor, but on my 2.7 GHz machine, no matter how many times I repeat a segment, a success on this particular control seems to be impossible.  Success in these activities may not be necessary to proceed in the game, but a "built in" failure process greatly detracts from what would otherwise be an extremely enjoyable exercise.\n\nIt might be better with a controller, but, otherwise, I can only recommend this game for those who have super-fast reflexes and/or don't mind the frustration of not being able to achieve success in entire subsets of the story.\n\n","April 11, 2015","false","6.2"," 14 of 27 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","14","27","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/eliamoroes/recommended/312840/","eliamoroes","Elia Moroes","http://steamcommunity.com/id/eliamoroes/","221 products in account","Fahrenheit: Indigo Prophecy could be best described as an interactive movie directed by David Cage and published by Quantic Dream during 2005. The player takes controls of Lucas, a man who finds himself a murderer for reasons beyond his control, and Carla and Tyler, two detectives from the New York police department investigating on the same murderers where Lucas is involved.\nIf you are familiar with the other works from Cage (namely, Heavy Rain and Beyond: Two Souls on the Playstation 3), then you already know what you're in for. If not, Fahrenheit plays out as a typical adventure game: you must interact with items and talk to people in order to advance, the only difference being the whole "cinematic" feel of the whole thing (your movements are limited and you use quick time events to perform several actions). The formula is broken only on rare occasions (there are two stealth sequences, for instance) and the tasks you will be asked to complete vary a lot. At various points in the game you can take choices that will alter the main story, for better or worse: the adventure features different endings, with the very final sequences being a big factor in which one you'll get.\nAnother important gameplay mechanic from Fahrenheit is the sanity meter of the three characters: each one will get more or less depressed as the events of the story unfolds, with dire consequences if a character will get too hopeless. Performing certain actions or picking precise choices can increase or decrease a protagonist's sanity, althought this vary from character to character and honestly sometimes there is no any way to know in advance.\nThere are in-game bonus cards that can be found scattered across the various sequences, sometimes in view, sometimes hidden in drawers and such. They award bonus points that can be later used at the end of the game to purchase concept art, movies and other goodies.\nOne of the main problems I experienced in Fahrenheit: Indigo Prophecy are not about how omnipresent the QTEs are, but how tricky they can actually be. While playing expect to be suddendly tasked to clear various QTEs in rapid succession, with a lot of buttons to press at the right time. It's worth mentioning that failing most QTEs will result in a game over and the necessity to reload the game from the last checkpoint, but sometimes failing a QTE is necessary to achieve certain results, down to the very multiple endings: the game doesn't explain this at all. You should also know that using a keyboard could carry some technical difficulties too (button presses not being recorded and such).\nAnother problem from Fahrenheit worth mentioning is that the unexpected gameplay changes and some special sequences could be a serious issue for first time players and are mostly about trial and error (I'm referring to the far too many timed missions with Lucas, where you have to peform certain action in order to dodge a game over in the short time given, or two stealth sequences I mentioned above).\nTo end this review, you may have heard that Fahrenheit: Indigo Prophecy's story gets a bit ... twisted towards the end. I'd agree with that statement: while what we could call the first act of the game drags far longer than necessary, the second and the third act introduces so many outlandish and complicated elements that never have enough time to be properly fleshed out. While this was due to a severe executive medding, we can only judge what we have in our hands.\nThe remastered version doesn't add any new content whatsoever and provides mainly a graphical overhaul for HD displays.\nIn short, Fahrenheit: Indigo Prophecy is an interesting experimental game with an average story and a very tense gameplay, but it's very easy to find it entertaining at least","March 1, 2015","true","9.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Back in 2007 than I first heard about Fahrenheit from friends I didn't know what to expect of it, and I really couldn't get into it. Long story short, after getting into another Cage&QD Experience - Heavy Rain, I was impressed and suprised by the game and last year I played through B2S and was dissapointed how it turned out.\n\nNow I'm going back to the original of QD interactive Drama/Supernatural/TV/Cinematic thing. I know there is a DreamCast game made by QD but that doesn't look like QD we all know and love or not. So yeah, speaking about Fahrenheit this exceded my expectations, its a better and more engaging story than B2S, yet Heavy Rain is going to be my favorite QD game. (I hope for PC RE-releases on both those games), c'mon that easter egg at Tyler house, Vynil Case with Beyond Two Souls Official Score should mean something. *believe*\n\nAfter so many years I managed to finish it and yes it is worth it. But there are problems, technical probs with the game.

My first quantic dream game i played was Heavy Rain on the ps3, and let me tell you this i went into that game thinking it was going to be like Max Payne with 3rd person shooting and stuff. Boy was i wrong, it was heavily based on qte (quick time events) and decision making throughout the game. I played it through to the end and loved it, game of the year contender for 2010 for me hahaha and earned a place in my library of games. So on to Fahrenheit, first of all i had no idea this came before Heavy Rain and never knew it was on the Ps2 back when i had the console. But thank God they remastered in HD and on PC :p. Now this game is a bit different then Heavy Rain interms of Realism but i love the fact it didnt lose Cage's flavor.

In the first scene you're standing over a body that you can't remember killing, and it doesn't slow down from there. There's a "stress" game mechanic where you have to drink coffee, have sex, and do other morale-boosting things to keep from going totally insane. Which, under the circumstances, is a challenge. (Doing things like leaving bloody clothing where people can see it? Stressful, and there may not be enough coffee in the world to make up for it.)\n\nI'm having trouble explaining why this game is so amazing... the epic plot is one not everyone appreciates (it could've used a sequel or two to expand on what's eventually revealed about the underlying world and causes) but that's not really the point. You're fighting to survive, make sense of the world, and keep your mind intact from one scene to the next. It's immersive to the point that if your character gets hit, you wince.\n\nBy the way, you play as three distinct characters (mostly) so you'll be thrown into the shoes of people who sometimes have different agendas, one after the other. Have fun trying to simultaneously cover up and investigate a crime - it'll make your head spin, but in a good way.\n","November 12, 2015","true","15.0"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

The game is set in New York during winter time and you start the game in a toilet in a diner. You have to watch you character being possessed and carving symbols into his wrists before murdering someone else in the toilet. Your character comes to and sees what he has done and the cut scene finishes you are then thrown into his shoes and have to try and clean up the scene and leave the diner before your are discovered. This was super cool to me then and now because it really creates a tense atmosphere and this game has a way of being very real. After escaping you are then introduced to the other two protagonists NYPD homicide detectives. You have to look for the clues left by your former self you have to find the mistakes that you made during the initial sequence. This could be anything from leaving the murder weapon to leaving traces of blood and this is what makes the start of this game so good its all about the actions YOU make.

But the subtle detective/ fugitive story has turned into a complete mess by the end of teh game dealing with themes of apocalypse and doomsday. It's really dumb.  I finished this game in one six hour sitting and my brief memory of the demo was somewhat ruined.\n\nIn retrospective this was an ambitious game for the time it was created where developers were less afraid to take risks and i can see why it got the appeal that it did. It is somewhat of a cult game branching out to a niche audience. But honestly if the game had retained the quality of it's initial sequences this could have been up there with the best games of that era of gaming.

It starts off very strong. Great atmosphere, fantastic music and a very interesting premise. It stays fairly strong until just past the halfway point in the game. Then, it gradually degrades. It becomes incredibly non sensical story wise, Deus Ex Machina ridden and feels rushed. Gameplay wise it feels like 'Heavy Rain' (made by the same people) but has a very annoying 'Simon Says' element in cutscenes which distracts you from actually paying full attention to the cutscene.\n\nThe first half of the game is worth playing, it's very good.

Lucas tries to figure out what happened to him, and Carla and Tyler notice there is something strange with this case. Soon after, the plot takes a twisted dive off the deep end into a river of burning sh*t, like someone decided to drop acid part way through writing this game. I'm pointing my finger at you, David Cage.  With a war between two clans of Mayans magicians and Artificial Intelligence "things" to find a child who knows the answer to a question that will grant ten thousand years of power. Then, they pulled a Sixth Sense twist with Lucas being dead the whole time, being controlled by a "module in his cortex" by the A.I. and Lucas gets superpowers from no where that he actually had the whole time, so wtf.  So, after that huge spoiler alert, I stopped trying to figure out what was going on, and ultimately stopped playing the game before I could finish it.\n\nSince the story decided to f*ck my brain, I forced myself to concentrate on the actual gameplay mechanics to try and get through the rest of this game. Which may have been a bad idea, as I may have had better luck tolerating this game if I took my skull-f*cking like a man and tried to figure out the story. First, you control the most mundane tasks for the characters.\n\n*swipe left to open top drawer*\n"It's empty."\n*swipe left to close the top drawer*\n*swipe down to open the bottom drawer*\n"The thing I need is in here."\n*swipe up to take the thing*\n*swipe down to close the bottom drawer*\n\nI'm pretty sure the only reason why the game didn't make you swipe left to move your left foot, and right for your right foot, just to walk forward; was because you had to do that for a few climbing sequences, and it was unbearable for those short periods of time; also QWOP wasn't made until a few years after this game came out. Second, if you aren't walking around looking at things, or talking to someone, the game plays a cutscene with a quick time events overlay. Which, turns every badass fight scene in Indigo Prophecy into a game of "Simon Says." The overlay is literally simon says, I wish I was making this up. Finally, there's the conversation mechanic. There is literally no way to predict how the other character will react to a topic you bring up (unlike how it is in Mass Effect or Deus Ex: Human Revolution). But, all their reaction can do is raise or lower your "mood." I can't figure out what the mood bar does; characters don't act different and even at zero ("wrecked" mood) the character won't go off and kill themselves, there's plenty of ways you can do that on your own, on accident  don't mix pills and alcohol.  So, I didn't mind conversations that much, since there was no way to mess them up.\n\ntl;dr\n- Story that took M. Night Shyamalan off guard\n- Controlling every mundane task\n- Having to play Simon Says over every cutscene\n+ Conversation control wasn't bad\n+ Character mood doesn't change a thing\n\n2/5\n*Solid Meh*\n\nnot for me","June 15, 2015","false","6.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

An innovative game that feels more like an interactive movie with an interactive experience/control system similar to the one which has brought Telltale games recent success. Story driven, dialouge under pressure, and combinations of directions and buttons used in the action scenes. An innovative system back in 2005 and one that still holds weight. A fantastic remaster which consists of better graphics, and the musical score is brilliant, I think this time in better quality from what I can recall. I will also add that the game is still among one of the only games which uses split camera, real time action in a way that brings a fantastic thriller style movie, some of the shots and the framework on the camera angles are delightful, and would make many film directors proud.... Having now completed the game I would like to say that I really LOVED the plot and the way the game went. The occult ancient ritual story line, merging with the all powerful clans that control earth...? Loved it! I must say however that IS one of the most awkwardly un-needed sex scenes in a game ever !\n\nSo glad to finally have motivated myself to complete it!

[Despite what many say about the ending, I actually thought the whole game wrapped together nicely. However, I can see where some would disagree with my thoughts.]\n+ Unique usuage of the two systems. [The A/D and the WASD+Keys]\n+ Just hard enough that you have to try, but easy enough that you can still enjoy the game.\n+ Requires more thinking than just randomly clicking. Learned that in the first scene of the game.\n+ Morale. Your character cares about what he just did, and little things affect him.\n\nCons:\n- Stealth. I cannot stress this enough, I hate the stealth section of this game. Very poorly designed.\n- Character switching. It felt a bit clunky, and I switched characters minimally due to this.\n- How far your person will drop without your control.\n\nOverall, this game was actually a very enjoyable experience. I intend to play it several times over and see what happens if I do things a bit differently.

What Aspyr done so far was just fixing all the Win8 bugs that prevented to load the original game, adding widescreen and proper xbox360 controller support and update the textures for a 1080p experience.\nNevertheless the game's graphics look outdated, so don't expect any Ocarina of Time 3D or Majora's Mask 3D quality upgrade here...

Multi camers and viewports\n- easy to find the destination.\n- just looks cool to see a several view points at the same time in one screen.\n- Displaying an enemy character in the auxiliary view port was very thirilling when the character need to do something before the enemy catches him.\n2. Mood\n- I felt emotions like fear(basement of police station and mental hospital), excitement(while fighting with Oracle and avoiding police) and embarrassment(when something fall apart).\n- Music is really helping it.\n3.  Graphical effects\n- I liked flashback, shocked screen(burning white) and ghost view fullscreen effects.\n- Magnifying glass and snow effects was also interesting.\n4. Excellent voice acting.\n\nSomething wanting.\n\n1. eight arrows in the center of screen.\n- these arrows sometimes annoying me and I couldn't focus on the actual scene because of it. I wanted to give my eye focus to the action animations in the actual scene but I coudn't.\n2. Polygon count and animations are not remastered.

It was just Indigo Prophecy, as I played it in North America, and because of that it was also the cut version. So with this game, you get the remasted (with decent graphics) and an uncut story. All in all, Indigo Prophecy is an amazing game with a perfect and thrilling story. I really wish that they make a movie for this one day for it would make an excellent film.","February 14, 2015","true","8.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I won't say anymore since it might spoil the game... still I was very disappointed with the way they went with it.\nB, Again coming back to the final 10 minutes, it feels like the game was rushed. A couple new players are suddenly introduced; Jade who is apparently very important is a vegtable who says one sentence and dies; There's a magic cyborg that comes out of nowhere and is defeated with a single quick time sequence (compared to lengthy sequences earlier in the game for insignificant actions)...\n","March 22, 2015","true","9.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Go and give it a go, you won't be disapointed! :)\n\nI'd like to share a few thoughts about this Remastered version.\n\nNow I understand the people saying that this game shouldn't be called Remastered, since the graphics haven't been really touched, so it is somewhat a letdown if you look it that way.\n\nHowever, I still think that this version is a success in other ways.\n\n1. The textures haven't been replaced, but the game still has a native HD resolution and to be honest it looked pretty good even on my 55" television. Okay, I can't and won't compare it to any new title, but it was certanly a nice improvement over the original version.\n\n2. X-Box controller support. Now this might seem like a minor thing, but honestly when I first tried out my controller with this game I instantly noticed how great it was. It was far more superior than the keyboard and mouse combo  I usually prefer in PC games. I felt that this game was ment to be played with a controller, for example the moves you have to make to open a door or make a decision can be done with the controller sticks. Playing with a controller simply boosts the experience.\n\n3. Un-cut version, nothing to say here really, about time we got this. :)\n\n4. Price tag. I bought this game for 8.99€ and that was it's full price. If you consider that this is an improved version, and the original game has been taken off Steam a long time ago, not to mention that this is a quality game, you'll see that it is not a high price to pay. Still think it is a bit much? Wait for a sale and get it for half the price or even less! You can't go wrong.\n\nOverall it was a great fun for me to start the game again after all these years just laying in my bed with my X-Box controller in my hands looking at my 55" flatscreen. I'd recommend you to do the same. :)\n","April 14, 2015","true","3.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

All the stupidity, poor writing, bad voice-acting, and left-turns into full-on Crazyville are there for the player to observe and gape at in all their David Cage glory. Unfortunately, the gameplay (or lack thereof) also makes the transition, which undermines the experience by being just as garbage as it was when the game was first released. David Cage's obsession with QTE-based action sequences and the 3D equivalent of pixel-hunting will forever baffle and confuse, but as with the original release: it all works to the game's credit, because we play David Cage games for the same sort of entertainment found in watching The Room.\n\nI would love to give this game a recommendation, but I can't. The port is glitchy: it took me two hours to figure out how get it to stop crashing to desktop every time I tried to start a game, and it crashes anyway every time I have to reload. These problems are all solved by running the game in windowed mode, but playing a game that's pretending to be a movie in window mode is like watching TV shows in the little PIP box while the menu takes up the rest of the screen. If you buy this game, figure out if it will work immediately and refund if it doesn't. It isn't worth the time to make it work when you could be playing something else. Unless, like me, you're a massive fan of David Cage's lunacy.","November 26, 2015","false","9.3"," 14 of 30 people (47%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","47","14","30","5","0"

I love mystery games like this. Ive bought this game 3 times to try to get to play it.   Once the disc was bad, once they sent it for the wrong system. When I finally torrented it for PC, it worked, but people said you needed a gamnepad. I bought one, and still, the controls were awful.\n\nWell im pleased to say that the gamepad controls are now ever so slightly less ♥♥♥♥♥♥. That is to say- the controls are ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥.  We'vce had third person gaming now for at LEAST 20 years. Im not sure why trying to control my character has to feel like im driving a car with a spoon glued to the steering wheel (this is a completely apt analogy. You'll see).\n\nA police officer is pounding at my door. I have to rid the house of evidence. I pick up a bloody rag (which for some reaosn requires contextual right analog stick motions instead of a regular button push), and hurriedly carry it over to the window to toss outside. I find theres no option to throw it outside. Almost out of time, I frantically mash buttons to try to drop the bloody rag. Come to discover, the only option to rid myself of the rag is to walk back to the EXACT SPOT where I picked it up, and drop it. Stupid. Stupid, stupid, stupid. So thanks to the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ tank-esque controls, im caught red-handed  (literally) when the cop bursts in thru the door. THANKS DEV TEAM.\n\nThat said, story seems interesting. Lot of different options. Switching characters, and different characters find different clues and conversation points.\n\nAll in all, 7/10 thusfar.\n\nEDIT: I take it back. ♥♥♥♥ THIS GAME. Ive never yelled FUUUUUUCKKKKKK YOUUUUUUU  at a game so many times. Never been so close to putting a controller thru the screen as i am right now while playing this ♥♥♥♥ing game. ♥♥♥♥ this game and its garbage ♥♥♥ controls.\n\nWhat a shameless cash grab. I can find nothing "remastered" about this game. Its just as frustrating as it was the first go-round. Hell i only payed $5 for this and im annoyed. I had a torrented copy of this for free that played just as well.\n\nLazy.\n\nAnd yes...I mad.","June 24, 2015","false","75.0"," 8 of 18 people (44%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","44","8","18","2","1"

It is the kind of game that really gives a special feel. That intro in New York at night with the snow falling heavily outside Doc's Diner.

I cannot change between old graphics and new ones, though, so that's something I'm curious about. Will look further into it.\n\nI'm playing with a PS3-controller through a tool that makes my system think it's a 360-controller, and it works flawlessly.\nAll in all, this is a great game, especially considering how old it is.

They did a botched job on the port to PC in the sense that, sure, you may use a controller, but it will be missing one button, and you can't set it. You are missing one stick. A pretty vital thing to be missing in a game which makes use of all buttons on any controller. They can't even have QT it before release!

Of course since it's an old game.\n\nGameplay: 2/10 The game mechanics are possibly the most annoying things you'll ever see. From evading a thousand props for no reason by pressing the same keys on screen (this feels like an extreme version of Dance Dance Revolution) to constantly running through the same hallway 10 times. Completely unnecessary, tiring, and repetitive.\nEven when talking to other characters, and you've asked 1 or 2 questions to the person in front of you, for some reason you are later not allowed to make the other possible questions, which were offered just a few seconds ago. The game basically prohibits you from talking after a few tries.\nThere's also another game mechanic that is still here, which is spamming the LEFT and RIGHT buttons. It's horrible. And even if you get a program to spam it for you, the game adapts so horribly to your button-pushing that it misses your actions and says "oh, I didn't see you pressing the correct button (either L or R) so I'll just supposse you didn't press ♥♥♥♥ and make you fail".\n\nSound: 4/10 The audio is almost completely mono (1 channel) and it doesn't feel anywhere near from a "remastered" version.\n\nGraphics: 5/10 They could've put so much more work into it, but apparently just making better face and clothing textures is enough for the game. This feels like Half-Life (1) made in the 20th century. Wait..\n\nConclusion\nThe game has a great story. But you'll be spending a lot of time progressing because of obvious but horribly designed puzzles and trying to get a goal by pressing a total of 150+ keys in just 2 minutes, because of its horrible, non-polished game mechanics that will literally make you mad and tired. The story is the best thing of this, but since the story is the ONLY good thing about this game, you might just want to watch a walkthrough on YouTube, instead of having to deal with the button-pushing, Dance Dance Revolution-like design of this game.\n\nTL;DR If you have the old version of this game, stay with the old version. If you don't, then, for your own good (and for the health of your hands and wrists) watch a walkthrough.","February 24, 2015","false","5.1"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

Works brilliantly in 4K, and runs smoothly. Textures are really sharp, better than in most games these days, You can see every text from a payphone when you zoom to first person, and this is a 3rd person game so textures wouldn't even need to be that good. But at least, great work on this version.\n\nStill has same mood as original, as it is remaster and not a full remake. Still same game, with better resolution support, sharper textures, better controller support and so on.\n\nGame focuses a lot on a story, where you control multiple characters. A murdered who wasn't aware of what he was doing, and two detectives who are solving that case. Each character has a mood-meter, which can go down when character doesn't succeed, and goes up when they solve something etc.¨\n\nStory is interesting, as characters seem to lose their minds over the case, as it becomes more and more supernatural. You will be challenged with many situations that might affect what you'll face later on.\n\nOne of games mechanics is QTE's, and they are not a bad thing. They are integrated well into game, and offer a way of doing quick minigames which game has now and then.\n\nAlso featuring talking system, as in Telltales walking dead, where you have limited time to answer your questions. I think answers might not affect as much as in TWD, but still answers that you get for your answers might have an affect in your mood-meter on so on.\n\nWhole game is a movie like experience, and if i say cinematic; i do not mean 24fps, game runs smoothly.\n\nOverall, on of my favorite games of all time. Still, hoping that they will port developers newer games to PC.\n\n\n\n","January 29, 2015","true","7.5"," 23 of 49 people (47%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","47","23","49","5","0"

Confused and with no memory how or why he had killed that man the story begins and will send you into a world full of mysteries and dark forces.\n\nA very interesting feature of this game is to play different characters and each action of one character will result in different outcomes when you play the other character. Lucas can try to remove his traces from the crime scene and when playing the detective Carla Valenti you have to search for clues and evidence of the murder. This is something which makes this game so much enjoyable and replayable. It plays just like an adventure only with a thick cinematic touch, like a movie where you can interact and change the possible outcome.\n\nThis HD Remake enables you to play the game in high def resolution, the original version of the game only supports max resolution of 1024x768. Furthermore you will notice some sharper textures and there is also the possibility to change between the new and old textures while you are in the game with the key F9. Yes, the graphics aren't the same as in the latest games of Quantic Dream like Heavy Rain or Beyond: Two Souls. But back in 2005, this was standard and with some playing time you'll get used to it.\n\nAfter all if you are looking for an interactive movie with and interesting dark story and different outcomes then this is the game for you!","January 31, 2015","true","8.4"," 21 of 46 people (46%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","46","21","46","4","0"

The storylines that quantic dreams has put out is always amazing and I feel this is just the beginnging for them. Graphically the remaster does smooth over quite well and holds up well for a game that was made over 10 years ago. For those complaining about it not being that "remastered" i would say that the price point reflects that fact and is fairly priced. I may forgive a few bugs or glitches for hope that there will be a future patch to fix the abnormalities. This is on the top of my list of favorite adventure games until the next great game they make takes that spot. Unlike any game you've ever played and completely worth it.","January 29, 2015","true","4.5"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","29","2","7","0","0"

Oh the QTEs.\n\nImagine you could somehow deal with the camera angles (which are comparable to a square wheel in functionality) but the QTEs make you ragequit hard time after time.\nThe game just tells you to get ready and then slaps you in the face with a task that you fail at least three times before figuring out which buttons you're even supposed to use for this particular ♥♥♥♥♥how, then you fail some more going trial-and-error -style about HOW EXACTLY to move the analog stick up or something, and THEN some more failing because what's required of you is more or less inhuman, or just stupid. It's never intuitive, logical or the least bit pleasant.\nEvery single time that doomed "GET READY" appears on the screen you find yourself moaning in agony, screaming "WTF am I supposed to do?" at your controller and in the end watching your character ♥♥♥♥ing up again and again and again.\n\nIt gets to the point where you're not focusing at all on the story or what's actually happening on the screen, but instead on the controller and the pain you feel in your fingers and brain trying desperately to decipher the ridiculously bad controls. Every chance you give this game ends with you curled up in a ball in some corner, crying how you just wanted to play a nice story-driven game for a change.\n\nDoes this sound like an immersive or fun gaming (or "movie watching" as they call it) experience yet?\nThought so.\n\n\nSo,  I really wanted to like this game. Maybe I could've, if only playing it didn't feel like doing 4 kitchens worth of dishes with only a toothbrush and your own spit. But if that's your thing and you have the patience of a saint, sure, go for it. For everyone else I recommend just watching a playthrough on YouTube, as the story is actually OK (if you're into the unintentionally funny B-movie type).\n\nIn the end I'm just bitter, oh so bitter and considering a refund, maybe getting something from TellTale in exchange. And some therapy. And maybe new eardrums for everyone else in the room who went deaf from my screaming (Sorry!).","April 3","false","3.1"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"

[Spoiler free review]\n\nGameplay:\nThe gameplay is best enjoyed with a controller (I used an xbox 360 controller) and relies mainly on Quick Time Events (QTE) of hitting the joysticks in different directions as events play out, with failure costing you "lives" or outright ending the game. Reaction time is important, but I played it on normal and found it somewhat challenging without being ridiculous. There are also events which require "stamina" like taping the L and R shoulder buttons to build up the strength gauge. Aside from QTE sequences there's third person "search" modes where you basically gather clues, talk to people, or interact with the environment, with the ability to move the camera angle through preset angles or move it independently using the joystick. Most dialog is on a timer, meaning you have to choose a conversation option before time runs out during an interview.\n\nConcepts:\nYou play as each character in the story: the two detectives, as well as the perpetrator; It's interesting that you solve the crime you commit, haven't seen that in a game before. The characters are well developed, and are all unique enough to genuinely feel like a movie plays out (actually the New Game menu option is New Movie, the premise is kind of like you're playing out a movie.) Each character has an individual "stress gauge" in which you have to maintain their mental health, different events and actions will impact it one way or another, supposedly if the gauge gets low enough your character will commit suicide or something (I haven't tried letting it get that low, but there are moments when it gets close!)\n\nStory (spoiler free):\nThe storyline I won't go into detail on for spoiler purposes. Let's just say it's well written, has some surprises, and isn't overly predicatable. The way it's "filmed" using multiple simultaneous camera angles at times, or unexpected cut-scenes is really effective. It feels like a movie, you'll have a different feeling play this then you would playing a typical adventure style game, it's incredibly unique and surprisingly gripping, haven't had that much connection with many adventure games other than "The Cat Lady" (also a very good, dark, serious-tone game.) It's not an easy story to predict either, takes a lot of twists and turns.\n\nAudio:\nThere are dark, ambient tracks for music, as well as some real-world artist tracks (notably Theory of a Deadman did a lot of the music for this game.) The choices of music or ambience really fit the story. The audio is all spoken voice-recorded dialogs, and they're done quite well: some games have voice dialog that you can tell was recorded at different locations then slapped together, making it sound wonky. I would think all voice actors were present at the same studio for the conversations they recorded as the tones and inflections they used seem appropriate for the conversation.\n\nGraphics:\nGraphics are dated by todays standards, they're sharp enough on wide screen to appear "as good as they can" for using the original models and textures. I didn't find it hard to live with, the character models display facial expressions, speech matches the mouth movement. It doesn't look cheesy, it looks like it did: a high quality graphic game for it's time.\n\nRemastered?:\nThere isn't a lot of "remastery" to this game, the textures have basically been made wide-screen compatible. Controller support was updated to support modern game controllers. It is also compatible with newer windows (I used windows 7) and didn't require any muck-around to make it play, something most PC gamers deal with. The audio is from the original game, the quality isn't as crisp as it could've been (in it's day a lot of compression had to be used to make it fit on media, therefore the spoken dialog is noticably compressed, kind of like listening to a lower bitrate MP3) It's not awful, but you'll notice it compared to modern games. The 3D models and textures maintain quality at the higher resolution option, but have not been redesigned by any means. Basically the remastery boils down to "works on modern hardware" in this case.\n\nSummary:\nI highly recommend grabbing this game. If you've never played it before, but enjoy crime dramas on TV, I think you'd really like what they offer. I'm a long-time gamer and this is one game I can't really relate to any other game, it's completely unique feeling (Dreamfall: the longest journey, is somewhat close.)\nGames like these are a rare breed, and for $10, you really can't go wrong. I got about 10 hours or so of gameplay out of my first run-through, but that's just one option, I plan on playing it again to see how I can change the outcome by picking different decisions and such. The only reason I would consider against buying it is if you do not own a game controller for your PC, don't want mature uncensored sexual content, don't like QTEs, or do not like serious, gritty crime games. Otherwise, this is one game you don't want to miss out on!","January 31, 2015","true","8.7"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","3","0","0"

In particular the giant dustmite at the office sequence, quite often not reflecting the inputs I was making.\nHave not had any issues visually, however between scenes or if you redo a scene. It will flicker out to a black screen, then come back in which really can ruin the immersion which a game such as Farheneit.\nBesides the higher texture resolution, the game fundementally hasn't changed at all - some welcome additions such as an onscreen mini-map I have noticed in story not present in the original, so far this only appeared in the flashback to the military base scene.\nNice little Easter egg in Tylers appartment on the LP collection and his toy.

Still has terribly annoying gameplay based on extremely irritating QTEs with both wasd and arrow keys during cutscenes and dialogue, makes it hard to follow anything. If that isnt frustrating enough that youll die from that, youll also have trouble selecting the right answer and also die because choosing answers is on a 2 seconds time limit and you cant push buttons (no that would be too mainstream), instead you have to swipe your mouse (not kidding here) so wrong choiced are unavoidable. On top of that you have an incredibly frustrating mental level that seems to be somewhat random from what i can tell. And at some point you may come across a scene where it decreasing is unavoidable and youll (guess what) die. If you didnt gather enough youll simply game over after you restarted again. Congratz, you screwed yourself over.

One of my absolute favorites of the genre. Its atmosphere and cinematic feel draws me in every time.\n\nThe graphics haven't aged well. This version has improved textures, but it's still very obvious the game's a few generations old. Models are low-poly and shadows and dynamic lighting are highly selective.\n\nHowever, the atmosphere and feel are still there. The game still works VERY well. And with 1080p support and antialiasing and anisotrophy etc, and with GREAT 360 gamepad support (mimicking the old X-box controls - trust me, they're integral to the experience and feel very organic even in the QTE's) this version is definitely worth a purchase.\n\nAs others have mentioned, though -- the final act of the game is a bit... weird. I've heard rumors this was supposed to be much longer, or possibly a trilogy of games. And they had to squeeze in a lot of story content into that third act. That pretty much sums up how it feels -- like they took all the big "revbeal" moments of two more games, removed everything between those moments, and stuck them after eachother. So now, the end part of the game isn't that great. Still worth a playthrough, though.","January 30, 2015","true","1.1"," 2 of 9 people (22%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","22","2","9","2","0"

If you never did, trust me on this: It's a bad game. The only thing it ever had going for it back when it came out a decade ago was that it was different, hence why people have difficulty remembering if they actually liked the game or if it is nostalgia talking. It was a fascinating game, but it was never considered to be a good video game EVER.\n\nThis game is directed by one of the few video gaming industry's auteurs, David Cage. While it is commendable that he goes for it and tries to innovate story telling in video games, the problem with David Cage is that he is a terrible story teller. Even when the story is good, he's bad at telling it. But don't get me wrong, the story in Indigo Prophecy is usually bad. There are a few good moments here and there but it's generally garbage. Especially by the end of the story, it turns into a comedy where David Cage himself remains as the only person who doesn't get the joke.\n\nThe only circumstance in which you should buy this game is if you want to see what the deal is about, because it is a video game that has had an impact on the industry.

I am disappointed. The story is engaging, but the controls are absolutely abysmal. They aren't responsive, making it extremely difficult to pass QTEs and therefore I fail the levels. The game also crashes and sometimes closes / minimises itself. I am almost appalled at the quality, to be honest. I expected better form Quantic Dream, though I know this is an older game, the controls should not be so useless.\nIf you can get over the horrible controls, the story is engaging, but the writing lacks the 'oomph' of the two newer games. If you're a fan of Quantic Dream, by all means give it a try, but only if you don't mind suffering through horrid controls and glitches.","May 14","false","4.7"," 6 of 27 people (22%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","22","6","27","3","1"

I mean, Fahrenheit: Indigo Prophecy Remastered, is an update of the PS2 era game of the same name. Focusing more on being a movie than a game, it provides a unique experience built from the ground up with mechanics that AAA developers nowadays seem willing to inject into what should be purely action games. However, this title partially succeeds at using these elements to tell an enthralling tale.\n\nVisuals: Sharper resolutions and cleaner textures combine with PS2 era animations and the camera catching things which shouldn't necessarily be in the frame. I noticed the latter issue during the end cutscene, with chunks of the sky and visual effects cutting off with a flat line because my monitor is too wide. Otherwise, for the most part, it looks okay. Also, the sex scenes look hilarious.\n\nAudio: The soundtrack isn't very large, so a lot of the same music will be played over and over. Where this game is strong is in its voice acting. Every character is believable and delivers their lines with enough emotion to keep the player engrossed.\n\nStory: With the exception of that turn for the (Steam censored what I said here, lol) in the last hour or so of the game, it's a very well organized plot with multiple paths. It's filled with people that the game gave me a reason to care about, and I rarely get attached a game's story. Also impeccable is the level of detail, such as how certain actions (or lack thereof) will affect the character, emotionally or physically. For example, forgetting to do one thing might force the player to hastily cover up evidence of that mistake, sometimes even in the presence of other characters.\n\nGameplay: If you are not dealing with Resident Evil controls or quicktime event overload, you cannot possibly be playing Indigo Prophecy. The tank controls, I can get used to, even in the pseudo-stealth sections. The constant quick-time events, not so much. Almost every task that does not have to do with walking, from having a drink, to having a superpowered fight with that old dude from Saw, is a quicktime event. It's boring, it's monotonous, and it oversimplifies some tasks while making others too complex. However, considering that it is clearly intended to be more of a movie, I can be a little forgiving in that regard.\nMore perplexing is how dialogue is handled. Short, one word descriptions representing my possible conversation directions do not adequately convey enough information to allow me to make an educated decision. Sometimes I'm not sure of the tone the character will take, sometimes I'm not even sure as to whose perspective I am controlling the dialogue from.\nOther times, the system just seems impractical. For example, when talking with somebody who is standing perfectly still and will not leave until I do, why is the conversation still timed? Why can I only talk about 2 items off of my list of 4 items when the person I'm talking to has nothing better to do?\n\nOverall, it feels like a Dragon's Lair arcade game with less cliché and an occasional ability to take a breather.","June 8, 2015","true","7.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

To me it seems like you have to be nostalgic to nog see the complete pice of poo this game is. First of, caling it remastered is a joke and a insult to developers who actually releases good remasters.\n\nThe controls are clunky, camera is bad, game crashes all the time (tested on 3 computers, Windows 7, Windows 8.1) and to top it off has a "HD" mode with changes so minor it's a complete joke.\n\nI'm sure this game was good back in 2005, and still could be today- this is what a remastered version is supposed to give the player. But a remaster with so minor changes and so many bugs and little love put in t it, is just not worth it. Even for the humble 5EUR i paid for it.\n\nI've played through about halv of the game and this is where I will leave it, can't stand all the crashing and controls form hell. Thankfully the developers has released a lot of good games after this one- for example Heavy Rain. Go buy and play that one instead and let this one rot.","June 7, 2015","false","4.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Somehow Carla knows what Lucas has found out? Minor to moderate spoilers here for elaboration: She has believed with certainty that Lucas is guilty of the murder for the entire game, yet she buys into his story at the cemetary with no indication of doubt coming beforehand? The Oracle can teleport out of the way of danger, yet he has to walk up to you at a snail's pace in order to kill you? Also, how the indigo child is important is never really explained, we only get the why.\n\nAt the end of the game, I can't shake the feeling that a heavy segment of narrative was deleted, like a few chapters were removed from the game inbetween the amusement park scene and the final graveyard scene.\n\nThe characters are kind of a pain to control with keyboard and mouse, which is what I used. Might have had an easier time with a controller like some of the others have suggested. The quicktime events were annoying at first but I just set the difficulty to easy about 2 hours into the game, it seems to only affect the QTEs and ADADADADA mashing segments. I liked the sanity management system, I found it interesting how its engagement with the little things that ultimately keep you from falling into suicidal depression as Lucas.\n\nThe graphics are dated without a doubt, and this game is hardly a "remaster", but if you're into murder-mystery type games, this one puts an interesting spin on it. You play as both the detectives and the killer himself, and spend the game attempting to piece together the events of a mysterious murder from both sides.

Somehow Carla knows what Lucas has found out? Minor to moderate spoilers here for elaboration: She has believed with certainty that Lucas is guilty of the murder for the entire game, yet she buys into his story at the cemetary with no indication of doubt coming beforehand? The Oracle can teleport out of the way of danger, yet he has to walk up to you at a snail's pace in order to kill you? Also, how the indigo child is important is never really explained, we only get the why.\n\nAt the end of the game, I can't shake the feeling that a heavy segment of narrative was deleted, like a few chapters were removed from the game inbetween the amusement park scene and the final graveyard scene.\n\nThe characters are kind of a pain to control with keyboard and mouse, which is what I used. Might have had an easier time with a controller like some of the others have suggested. The quicktime events were annoying at first but I just set the difficulty to easy about 2 hours into the game, it seems to only affect the QTEs and ADADADADA mashing segments. I liked the sanity management system, I found it interesting how its engagement with the little things that ultimately keep you from falling into suicidal depression as Lucas.\n\nThe graphics are dated without a doubt, and this game is hardly a "remaster", but if you're into murder-mystery type games, this one puts an interesting spin on it. You play as both the detectives and the killer himself, and spend the game attempting to piece together the events of a mysterious murder from both sides.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/burshoo/recommended/312840/","burshoo","Bushro","http://steamcommunity.com/id/burshoo/","155 products in account","Heavy Rain... I mean, Fahrenheit: Indigo Prophecy Remastered, is an update of the PS2 era game of the same name. Focusing more on being a movie than a game, it provides a unique experience built from the ground up with mechanics that AAA developers nowadays seem willing to inject into what should be purely action games. However, this title partially succeeds at using these elements to tell an enthralling tale.\n\nVisuals: Sharper resolutions and cleaner textures combine with PS2 era animations and the camera catching things which shouldn't necessarily be in the frame. I noticed the latter issue during the end cutscene, with chunks of the sky and visual effects cutting off with a flat line because my monitor is too wide. Otherwise, for the most part, it looks okay. Also, the sex scenes look hilarious.\n\nAudio: The soundtrack isn't very large, so a lot of the same music will be played over and over. Where this game is strong is in its voice acting. Every character is believable and delivers their lines with enough emotion to keep the player engrossed.\n\nStory: With the exception of that turn for the (Steam censored what I said here, lol) in the last hour or so of the game, it's a very well organized plot with multiple paths. It's filled with people that the game gave me a reason to care about, and I rarely get attached a game's story. Also impeccable is the level of detail, such as how certain actions (or lack thereof) will affect the character, emotionally or physically. For example, forgetting to do one thing might force the player to hastily cover up evidence of that mistake, sometimes even in the presence of other characters.\n\nGameplay: If you are not dealing with Resident Evil controls or quicktime event overload, you cannot possibly be playing Indigo Prophecy. The tank controls, I can get used to, even in the pseudo-stealth sections. The constant quick-time events, not so much. Almost every task that does not have to do with walking, from having a drink, to having a superpowered fight with that old dude from Saw, is a quicktime event. It's boring, it's monotonous, and it oversimplifies some tasks while making others too complex. However, considering that it is clearly intended to be more of a movie, I can be a little forgiving in that regard.\nMore perplexing is how dialogue is handled. Short, one word descriptions representing my possible conversation directions do not adequately convey enough information to allow me to make an educated decision. Sometimes I'm not sure of the tone the character will take, sometimes I'm not even sure as to whose perspective I am controlling the dialogue from.\nOther times, the system just seems impractical. For example, when talking with somebody who is standing perfectly still and will not leave until I do, why is the conversation still timed? Why can I only talk about 2 items off of my list of 4 items when the person I'm talking to has nothing better to do?\n\nOverall, it feels like a Dragon's Lair arcade game with less cliché and an occasional ability to take a breather.","June 8, 2015","true","7.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The graphics and animation didn't age well. If you haven't played it at least five years ago or if you didn't grow up with knife-shaped faces and rigid movements, you may not like it. If you enjoyed it back then, don't hesitate. You will overlook the details and immerse yourself again in the story.\n\nIndeed, the story is captivating, somewhere between The Matrix and The X Files: ritual murders, action, mystery, paranormal activities, mid-air fights and the truth is out there, it has everything to keep you entertained for a few hours. The characters backgrounds are enough developped to make you care about them, a great point when you need to chose their fate.\n\nOverall, Fahrenheit is more an interactive movie than a game. The main game phases are:\n- chosing a relevant topic for a dialogue to move you further in the story\n- looking for clues in a room or living your everyday life in your office/apartment\n- QTE\n\nThe QTE phases are fast-paced so you can't really watch the action.

For the time this game came out it was a brand new genre. It is a story driven game so don't expect any shooting or action, it is just mostly quick time events and investigation that is all. It can be boring and repetitive but i had "mild" fun with it. Even if the graphics are old as hell i find them nice and maybe nostalgic the soundtrack is nice also.","December 11, 2015","true","6.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Even coming in with the knowledge that the story would turn batshit crazy before you know what's happening, I was still reeling when it happened. It's like the game is missing an hour of plot or something.\n\nThe game aged badly with the controls but at this price, it's worth it to play it until at least 75% as the story starts great and everything is interesting. I compare it to a Cthulhu story where it starts as a normal murder investigation with police work and then the supernatural elements start to show up.\n\nMy only real complain is the excessive use of QTE that are still hard on Easy... You need to focus all your energy on them hence you keep missing the action and all the flashes/camera angles make you lose track of them so you miss more prompts than you would otherwise.","December 31, 2015","true","7.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Overall the game is fun, visually interesting and has a reasonably strong atmosphere and soundtrack. However, there are quite a few flaws. The controls and camera are frustrating, even more so on stealth and timed sequences. The action sequences distract the player from what's taking place on the screen and are too easy once the player has got to grips with it and it's difficult to define what constitutes a passed or failed attempt at hitting the required buttons in time. Another major flaw is the story, which starts out as quite an intriguing mistery but ends up a completely confusing mess with elements that seem to be thrown in the mix for the sake of it. The characters don't have much depth and It also feels like developments in character relationships take huge leaps in short spaces of time and theres some parts that just absolutely make no sense towards the end and other parts that appear completely unecessary. I'd probably say this game is worth playing because it's fun, atmospheric and innovative but it could have been so much better.","October 7, 2015","true","11.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Only that this is not as perfect.\n\nIn many ways the way the story was build was wonderfully done. It has all kinds of elements with a great mystery that is revealed gradually. I was hooked from the instant.\n\nBut then came the disappointment. In the beginning I thought that the main female character was made very well. I thought that she was intelligent and independent and was able to go on in the story on her own, without depending on any "sex appeal". Boy was I wrong. This game has a lot of moments where I had to literally make a facepalm gesture, from gym scenes to awkward and surprisingly revealing sex scenes. And what is even more stupid was how  she suddenly fell in love with the main male character even though she couldn't have possibly been able to now him properly beforehand.  Also there were some unnecessary racist remarks with the other main male character Tyler. He had the same white voice actor as Lucas, and was somehow very skilled in basketball.\n\nOverall it still had some great moments and I enjoyed the overall atomosphere a lot. The music is done by Angelo Badalamenti, who also did the soundtrack to Twin Peaks and some other projects by David Lynch. And I still recommend it for people who enjoy story driven games.\n\nThe gameplay itself was quite non-existent since the game was mostly full of reaction minigame sequences, but that really wasn't an issue for me. I still understand if it were for somebody else.\n\n7/10, I recommend buying it when it is on sale. Or you can just look through the playthrough from youtube. You wouldn't be missing on much if you did it that way.","March 17","true","6.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Up until that point, the story was incredible. I felt attached to all the characters, was genuinely interested in seeing where the story would go, loved the music, and only closed the game out once in my time playing. Beat it in two sittings. Both were in the same day. Until I reached the ending, my only real complaint was the controls. They are pretty lackluster and it chock full of weird little gimmicky button sequences. Early QTE's if you will.\n\nThe last..oh..two hours however, in a roughly eight hour game, are bad. The plot gets completely thrown out the window and it feels like a new writer came in with no idea of what happened in the game prior to their arrival. It makes the ending feel really disappointing, undeserved, and off-putting.\n\nI do like the game, honestly. But in the end, I really can't recommend it. You will love it up until that last act.

Albeit in 2015 we had many examples of such, in 2005 there was no instance of it. Their advanture game was supposed to be interactive movie. The way you use your mouse / controller or even QTEs was supposed to reflec that. And no, in 2005 QTEs were not oversused all over the board and were acceptable by community.\n\nPlaying as three characters, of which one is trying to evade other two and other two are hunting him is extremely interesting. When on a scene you forget something, make a mess, you give incentive and easier job to detectives in question. Mix of mystery and detective work is where this game excelles even 10 years after its release.\n\nBUT. This does not hold up to the hype. I don´t know what happened to writers team, but at half of the game, they started pushing story and extremely interesting dialogues into the background and bringing up the kung-fu, matrix cutsenes. Which looked in 05 really cool, however story suffers because of this. This can be overlooked if not for the last several chapters where plot twists are so ridicolious, the explanation behind everything is insulting and the main character suddenly becaomes zombie with all walking dead zombie characteristics murders it. It seems writers started with great idea, expanded upon it and than started to get stuck and when trying to invent the end they just went with this because "♥♥♥♥ it, we have deadline to make".\n\nStill, even though the end if horrible, the rest of the game is so great that I am here, 10 years later, replaying the game for 5th time and purchasing the remastered version for 9 euro. There are very few games which can say the same about themselves.","November 2, 2015","true","27.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Only that this is not as perfect.\n\nIn many ways the way the story was build was wonderfully done. It has all kinds of elements with a great mystery that is revealed gradually. I was hooked from the instant.\n\nBut then came the disappointment. In the beginning I thought that the main female character was made very well. I thought that she was intelligent and independent and was able to go on in the story on her own, without depending on any "sex appeal". Boy was I wrong. This game has a lot of moments where I had to literally make a facepalm gesture, from gym scenes to awkward and surprisingly revealing sex scenes. And what is even more stupid was how  she suddenly fell in love with the main male character even though she couldn't have possibly been able to now him properly beforehand.  Also there were some unnecessary racist remarks with the other main male character Tyler. He had the same white voice actor as Lucas, and was somehow very skilled in basketball.\n\nOverall it still had some great moments and I enjoyed the overall atomosphere a lot. The music is done by Angelo Badalamenti, who also did the soundtrack to Twin Peaks and some other projects by David Lynch. And I still recommend it for people who enjoy story driven games.\n\nThe gameplay itself was quite non-existent since the game was mostly full of reaction minigame sequences, but that really wasn't an issue for me. I still understand if it were for somebody else.\n\n7/10, I recommend buying it when it is on sale. Or you can just look through the playthrough from youtube. You wouldn't be missing on much if you did it that way.","March 17","true","6.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

While it is true that most of the gameplay is long sequences of QTEs, the most interesting part of the game comes from the dialogue options and choices that you get to make. The game has a very engaging story, and objects that you find in the world or the choices you make do have a surprising amount of impact. For a game set in a bleak NYC, it has a lot of humour and charm, balanced well with serious story sequences. For anyone looking for a story rich game, I would highly recommend Fahrenheit.","February 28","true","9.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Now, I want to like this game but it is impossible given the fact that I can't play actually play the darn thing!\n\nThe game crashes everytime I try and do a QTE segment where I dive in icey water (which btw is really early on). And the screen freezes but the game goes on...  so it isn't playable. Really damn sad.\n\nI heard someone mentioin it being a multi-core processor problem but I have no idea. All I know is that I wasted money on a crap port. I tried to make the game run in 1 core but either I suck at configuring or it just doesn't work.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/app/312840/discussions/0/492379159718229721/\n\n(has same problem as me)\n\nUPDATE:  I got it working. I turned down anisotropic filtering down to 8x instead of 16 and turned front-buffer effects off. I suspect the front-buffer effects were the culprit though.\nI tested it again and the front-buffer effects were the problem. I'll change my thumbs down if I go through the complete game without anymore annoying issues.\n\nFINAL THOUGHTS: Leave the anisotropic filtering at 8x. Later in the game, I experienced problems when I wanted to undo my actions/choices. How do you do this? Simple, pause the game and go  to "Stop" then when on the Main Menu, "Continue" . Eventully turning the filtering back down fixed a problem where my PC would freeze when I did this (and I'm a perfectionist on one of my playthroughs  so doing this is a must). So once I did that, I had no problems whatsoever with the game. Oh, and my PC is pretty good if I say so myself... so save yourself some neckstrain and implement these settings... it might just save you time where you could be playing the game instead of fixing it.\n\nI enjoyed this game a lot; the story was interesting throughout its entirety... once I figured out the game's mechanics (I.E. what ppl are calling horrible controls, but they work once you get them). I didn't know about a tutorial mode... so yeah check that out, it might save you from looking up these facts on the internet.\n\nThe story was fun. There were tense, funny, stupid, romanitc, wacky, and intersting aspects to the game's story... it just has it all. I thought the game would play out like Heavy Rain and be really grounded and gritty... but I was surprised, I mean the game has a lighter tone than that even though the first segment was pretty dark. The soundtrack is AMAZING! I love all the retro throwback tunes in this game that seem like hip-hop jazz 80's stuff. It also has some really nice orchestrational moody stuff for the right scenes.\n\nCritique: Controls take some getting used to. Change the run key to Space Bar instead of shift, makes it more intuitive.\n\nGame has aged and that shows by the character animation, lip sync, and facial experssions even though their making of videos look pretty high-tech for the time. (most of it can be ignored if your immersed).\n\nBIGGEST NEGATIVE: Forced stealth sections... What in the h3ll were they thinking? Leave the stealth to the stealth experts like the MGS series, Deus Ex, Splinter Cell, or The Last of Us. This game throws you into the most teeth nawing, horrbily implemented stealth expeience of the decade, right next to some other games that might be worth a mention. (This game is newer than most of the ones I'm about to mention having originally released in '06). The games were: GTA San Anderas, Return to Castle Wolfenstein, The Getaway: Black Monday, Uncharted 2: Among Theives, and Goldeneye 007. Now, I don't expect you to know all of these references but be my guest and look it up if your curious.\n\nLuckily, there are only 2 stealth sections to the game. I would reccomend looking up how to do it if you become tired of trial and error. How is folliwing a scripted path with no freedom considered a fun stealth experience? It was definitely out of place. Quantic Dream is good at one thing and one thing only: That is, interactive narrative experiences... not stealth.\n\nIf you've never played this game before, then I would recommend picking it up. In the game, if you press F9, you can switch between Original and Remaster and the difference whilst some would call minimal, I would say is definitely better. It's no Cysis or Metro 2033 so if your in it for the grahpics then what the h3ll are you doing reading this? xD So, if you can stand the negatives I mentioned and your looking for a good narrative experience, go ahead, you'll enjoy it.

What it did have was an excellent story, character interactrion and the freedom to choose how you wanted it to play out.  Heavy Rain, made by the same company, expanded that concept even farther but Indigo Prophecy was the first of its kind.

The game kept me glued to my computer and the characters were well done. Then about 3/4 of the way through the game it all just fell apart. The storyline just turned to a cheesy sci-fi movie complete with absurd, unexplained physics, seemingly contradictory logic, and romantic relationships that make no sense at all.\n\nFor instance:\n\n*SPOILER ALERT*\n\n\n\n<SPOILER>\nYou are told by the physical embodiment of a rouge computer A.I. that he revived you from death.  (???)  Then you have random sex with a girl you've had next to no interaction with and she reveals she loves you although she has only ever spoken to you like twice. Then later she says she is pregnant... Even though you're a dead man who was revived by A.I. And you're not brought back to life either, because the game repeatedly makes it clear that you don't have any body heat or breath, and the A.I. says that you cannot die.\n</SPOILER>","January 7","true","12.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

So, be prepared.\n- The game mostly consists of cruel QTE. It's way more challenging compared to Until Dawn and similar games, and fully utilizes both of your hands. Prepare to break your keyboard several times.\n- Gameplay isn't very polished. If you fail to solve a task, the game will not give you any hints, you're on your own.

It have a very specific way of telling the facts and presenting the history to the player, frequently it assumes camera positions and cuts that clearly show the objective of making the game closest as possible from a playable movie (and hell yeah it can do that). Not only can it make the player start making bounds whit its characters but also to love the game’s history (although sometimes looking like you’re watching a Matrix movie). Fahrenheit isn’t the type of game that you go and tell your friends and them play whit them. Every player has its own experience by playing it by himself. If you’re tired of explosions and shooting (at lease for a part of it) and is after a well told history, than Fahrenheit is for you. However, even if it isn’t what you’re looking for, it is worth to check it out.","May 21","true","9.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

David Cage has a unique style of gaming where your decisions advance the story, yet there is very little game play to be had. Cage likes to focus on story and presentation rather than how fun a game can be.\n\nWhile Fahrenheit is a game that was considered good for it's time, when people come back to it they kind of realize how actually ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t the game is. Granted it's a 10 year old game now so not everything looks as good as it used to, but the overall choices and stupidity you might expirence when you play this game leave you scratching your head. Now this in no way makes the game bad, in fact this remastering of the game is quite well done, but I feel as though when a character does something that doesn't make sense it's not really because Cage intended it but he just didn't understand how that should really work. Overall though this is a good story and was one of the first of it's kind, I reccommend it to people who enjoy story heavy games (The Walking Dead, The Wolf Among Us, etc)\n\nPotential Spoilers down below but nothing that isn't encountered within the first hour of the gameplay\n\nExamples of Stupidity in this game\nYou have the option to move the body of the man you had just murdered out of sight, and this is basically to spare you a few minutes to get out of the restaurant. You drag him to the stall and it leaves a blood streak on the floor. You can then use a nearby mop to wipe up the blood yet your character completely ignores the blood smear he just created or his own blood in the stall he was just sitting in.\n\nShortly after you wake up at your apartment, a lone cop will visit your house, he asks if you're the man he's looking for and says your neighbors heard screaming coming from your place, you can say it wasn't you or say you cut yourself on some glass, the officer askes to come in AND EVEN IF YOU REJECT HIM he comes in anyway without a warrent. If you didn't have a chance to clean your house he finds a bloody shirt on the ground and proceeds to arrest you, mind you, you could have just told him you cut yourself on glass. But if you hide that shirt, but not your sheets in your bedroom, you can stop him and tell him not to go in, I've only heard one option but you can say your girlfriend is asleep naked in there, after which the cop loses all suspicion in you and then leaves. It's obvious David didn't really understand American law, and he also wrote a path that was to be expected for all players rather than an actual branching story where characters at least remember something they were told five minutes beforehand\n\n\n\n\n","May 22","true","2.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

As you can see it is a remastered version, which is very big improvment in that game. I would like to talk about Pros and Cons of that game, which migh be useful for you to read before you will buy that game.\n____________\nPros\n1. The best Story Mode I've ever seen in my life. I think people really tried to get the story very interesting to not get gamers bored while play.\n2. Actions (For 2005 it was very big improvement like to turn on radio, read newspapers, and get drunk... As I said this game is from 2005 and it is really good for it's age).\n3. Choice-matter game, that makes you feel what is really going on, you can get in the situation that happens with your character...And if you choose the way to go, it might change your character's feelings and the whole story mode.\n____________\n\n____________\nCons\n1. I HATE CONTROLS ! ! ! Controls for this game terrible, and there is no way you can play that game normally (PLEASE CHANGE YOUR CONTROLS ! ! !  )\n2. Camera is not following the character exactly how it should be (You will see it once you will play it).\n3. No "SAVE" button...to make sure that you saved the game: press ESC (it opens menu), and press "quit" with that it will autosave your game without any worries.... NEVER PRESS STOP ! ! !  I accidently lost my story persentage  :(\n4. *I dont really count it as the Con but still, City is too empty for that game and too small access around, so there is no way that you gonna walk around and discover the city (like in GTA III ).\n____________\n\nI think that's it )))\nI telling you that you can play this game when you feel bored and don't want to do that much of things, just to chill alone and do some "lazy" gaming, because this game is mroe like CHOICE MATTER MOVIE )))) mostly you choose what to do and do some actions for a quick time. I don't have to say that much of stuff about this game, but I defently recomend you to play this game especially if you are fan of old games and retro stuff  :D\nI wish you guys the best game time to spend in this game.  :D","May 26","true","3.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I have only played a tiny bit but this version seems to shine as muc as I remember the old one doing.  Action is a little slow for those looking for combat, basically quick time events, but still fun.  Story is fantastic, untill the very end in which case it is absolutely ridiculous and horrible.  The first 9/10ths of this game makes up for the silly ending in my opinion though.  Barring the last 15-30 minutes I whole heartedly recommend this game.","May 18","true","0.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

They also require a very fast reaction time compared to many QTEs.\n\nWalking is the old "tank" controls (A and D spin you and W moves you forward but S turns you 180 degrees instead of backs you up) and the camera does not follow your movements and in many scenes you can only switch between fixed cameras while in other scenes you are able to control the camera (which also has the habit of getting stuck and causing you to not be able to see where you're going).\n\nThere is also a first person section which is a complete mess without a controller, the A and D keys are used to keep the cursor in the middle and the right mouse button is used to turn, it took a good while to finish the section as I kept messing up the event by trying to turn with the keyboard.\n\nI do like the timed events, they give you a sense of urgency in situations where it would be requred such as cleaning up a crime scene before getting caught.\n\nI would not recommend getting this game unless you plan to use a controller or just plain enjoy torturing yourself.","June 5","true","69.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
