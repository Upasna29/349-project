This game is AMAZING and i honestly loved EVERY SECOND of it from the start to the end, even with all the glitches and overly complicated levels.\n\nNo, the first thing you're thinking is: "Are the graphics still acceptable?"  No, they are dated and old, but after the first few levels and bosses you really come to realize how well they fit the secenry of everything and granted, if they were in 3d, they just wouldn't be the same.  Thats not to say that they arent realistic enough to enjoy though.  Every one of the monsters and weapons look unique, save for the shotgun maybe, but they don't get boring or hard to look at after a long time.\n\nWhile many may think of this an only an expansion for Doom, the biggest problem with Doom was that it left you wanting more, no matter how many monsters you destroyed in ever changing ways, you still wanted more.  By the end of Doom 2, i was so sick (in a good way) of seeing rooms full of imps that i'm holding an air shotgun when opening doors in my own house now.\n\nThe biggest problem(s) for someone who wants to buy this game is going to be:\n\nA: Is it worth my money?  A $5 dollar game takes a good chunk out of a $20 steam card.  But not only do you get the main game, you get and expansion pack, the doom2.wad file that allows you to play online using ZDoom or any other services, AND if you own Garry's Mod, you can use the full GM-Doom port (this alone is pretty fun).\n\nB: Does it play nice with Windows Xp, Vista, 7, or 8 computers?  Like most early Pc games on Steam, a dosbox code is included to run the game with no fuss in coding anything.  Though as I said before, you get the Doom2.wad file, (witch is the heart of the game) and that can be copy-pasted into ANY doom emulator.  Find one you like and its smooth sailing from there.\n\nC: Is the Difficulty too high/too low compared to today?  If its a mid 90's game, it's going to be hard.  Most of the challenge though is spent not so much in the fighting but in the surviving.  You CAN clear a room of 20 monsters with one quick rocket but is that rocket going to explode in your face? or is it going to aleart other enemies?  Your Choice.\n\nSo as i said,\nBUYITBUYITBUYITBUYIT its the best game in the series (Doom and Wolfenstien) and is 100% worth your time.","November 28, 2013","true","21.4"," 147 of 149 people (99%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","99","147","149","0","6"

Every evening around my bedtime, my dad would retire to "work" on it in his office, and I was told by my mom not to disturb him. Overcome with curiosity, I snuck out of bed one night to go and see what kind of work he was doing, only to find him playing this game instead. I was afraid he would scold me, but instead, he lifted me up on his lap, set me in front of the keyboard and said "Lass, the world needs us. Let's save it"\nIt became our regular thing. I would sneak out of bed without mom knowing and sit up with dad while we played Doom II until it was time for dad to go to bed. At first I just watched him, then he started to teach me what he was doing as he played. Not many days later, I got to try it for myself, and under his wing, I managed to complete the game with some assistance. It was such a thrill for me as just a little child, and I had so much fun doing it.\nEventually my mom caught us; my dad, who was supposed to complete his reports for his work, was instead playing a game filled with horrible monsters and gore with his young daughter, and me; a 7 year old girl up at 11 in the evening on a school night.\nShe was not happy.\nI got grounded and I didn't see her talk to dad at all for at least a week. Still, it is one of my favorite memories from growing up.\n20 years later, I still return to this game, again and again. While a bit outdated graphically, Doom II is still nothing but a pleasure after all these years, and I can do nothing but recommend it. My now 55 year old dad also still play it, and has nothing but positive things to say about it.\n\nMom still doesn't recommend it.\n\n\n10/10, would get grounded again","March 25","true","1.6"," 58 of 59 people (98%) found this review helpful 33 people found this review funny","98","58","59","33","1"

There are some distinct differences though. Allow me to demonstrate: If you go thru a level and come across some secrets filled with ammo, a new gun, or some health and armor and you manage to murder everything in your path to the level's end, you are probably playing the first DOOM. However, if you are rummaging through a level and stumble upon some supposed "secret areas" that seem to offer substantial offerings but then quickly you realize, "oh wait, no, now there are monsters completely surrounding me and my surroundings have suddenly transformed into what seems like hell itself with absolutely no escape." Following your savage death, or your desperate and hurried arrival to the level's end, you should know that you are playing DOOM II.\n\nDOOM II throws in a nice variety of additional enemies with some very unique and deadly abilities. The combination of these new oppositions in conjunction with the even more greatly thought out and twisted level-design ensure that DOOM II is bo no stretch a walk in the park once you have gone through the first portion of the game. This game is challenging (assuming you are on standard or higher difficulty) terrifying, exilherating, mindless in story conception, albiet mindfull gamers will surely benefit with this game because with the staggering odds that are pitted against you (the Space Marine) a sharp mind and hair trigger reactions and neccesary to conquer and to survive through this game's perilous campaign.\n\nEasily one of my favorite games of all time as a game mechanic and skill oriented player. This game holds up to this day and is also highly moddable since there has been such an everlasting community around this game and creating additional content and tweaks for it.\n\nI could not recomend this game higher if you are one gamer such as myself.","December 26, 2013","true","1.3"," 29 of 31 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","29","31","0","0"

Although other examples existed, nothing was as action packed as this one and nothing was as fun.\n\nHonestly, if you haven't played this game already, then I say "What are you waiting for???" Seriously, I don't care how old or young you are. If you're old enough to know right from wrong, violent is bad and all that, and love action games this game is SERIOUSLY the best bit of money you can spend. This game has aged fantastically, and the modding community keeps it alive to this day!\n\nThis is a port of the old DOS version, but you can go out there and get open source ports to complement this that will seriously improve the texture quality like ZDoom. When you do that then you open yourself to a whole new world of graphics and gameplay.\n\nTry the original game as it is, the amount of slaughtering you do will be a blast, But once you're done get out there and download some mods baby!\n\nThe two I recommend is "MegaMan 8-Bit deathmatch", in which you can play as Megaman or many different robot masters in deathmatch games, and Brutal Doom, a popular mod which ups the gore and detail factor in the game ads alot of extra gestures and taunts, improves the quality and design of weapons, and adds extra things like a iron signts and a boot to the head and a rip apart option. This is definitely the way to play the game all the way through!\n\nFor more details on Brutal Doom see my video on Brutal Doom v20 titled "Boot to the head!"\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM7hkR9pdPs","June 25, 2015","true","0.6"," 24 of 26 people (92%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","92","24","26","3","0"

The levels in DooM 2 are absolute masterpieces, each their own puzzle and often require good navigational skills as some are extremely elaborate and focus on non-linearity and good resource management.\n\nAs like the original DooM, the visuals in this are a work of art, each and every texture feels in place, the concept couldn't get much better, the atmosphere is evil and consistent and the architecture is flawless. DooM 2's gameplay is incredibly fast-paced and requires you to maneuver skillfully through hordes of monsters and causing 'in-fighting' between monsters to conserve ammunition.\n\nEach and every slight detail of design this game has was put into consideration; monster placement, switches, the way you progress, keys scattered around the map, secrets, traps, FPS has only come downhill from here, regardless of all the flashy cutscenes and graphics presented in todays games this offers a far deeper experience than pretty much every FPS to date.\n\nDooM 2 is the definitive FPS experience showing how great gameplay and level design work hand in hand with each other and how important that combination is in creating a flawless masterpiece, this is one game I complete atleast 3 times a year from start to finish and have more fun in it with each playthrough, I recommend you play this on Ultra-Violence as that is the way its meant to be played and without saving throughout the levels as that takes away a lot of the challenege.\n\n♥♥♥♥ you.","December 16, 2014","true","13.4"," 30 of 37 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","30","37","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/somebody336/recommended/2300/","somebody336","somebody336","http://steamcommunity.com/id/somebody336/","2760 products in account","Doom 2 is the second game of the franchise coming out only a year after the original was released. It is set right after the events that took place in Episode 3 of the first game where you have managed to return to Earth only to discover that it has come under attack by the forces of hell. It doesn't take long to find out why humanity is on the verge of extinction as the amount of monsters you see on Earth is more than you even see exploring hell in the first game. To make matters worse they have sent brand new demons such as the Archvile, chain-gun wielding zombies and other demons far more powerful than those you spent the majority of the time fighting in Doom 1. This is definitely a sequel made for those with lots of experience playing the original and will hold no punches back. It is a far more difficult game than the original, as such I would suggest starting with that one if you are looking to get in to the series. If you simply want to play some of the insane number of mods available then this is the one to get since must mods are for Doom 2.\n\nThe only new gun in your arsenal will be a double barreled shotgun and packs a heck of a punch to anyone in its path but lacks the great range of the single barreled shotgun making both viable options instead of a straight upgrade. One of the first things you may notice is that there are no longer any Episodes to choose from. Instead you start from level 1 and make your way to the end of the game from there. It sucks not being able to start at the middle or the end of the game anymore though I did find this change to be for the better overall as you no longer end an episode and have to collect all your weapons over again when you start the next one. You may be thinking that has the potential to make the game too easy as you can now stock up on tons of ammo but that is not the case. Due to the powerful new enemies and the sheer amount of numbers they throw at you, ammo feels more valuable than ever. In the original game you would tend to stick to the shotgun the majority of the time to save ammo for Cyberdemons but in Doom 2 that will more likely than not get you killed as it is very difficult to handle the new monsters with a shotgun alone.\n\nWhile the Cyberdemon is still the most powerful enemy you will face I somehow fear the Archvile just as much or even more. It is quite a nasty monster that will set you on fire if it can see you requiring you to hide behind any objects or walls to break its line of sight. All the while it resurrects previously defeated enemies making your situation far more dire every moment that it remains alive. Those are the kind of moments you will more likely than not swap out your trusty shotgun and use up much rarer ammo types in the hopes that you won't need it later. The level design in this is downright sadistic and will lock you into small rooms full of enemies, descend the floor beneath you to fall face to face with an enemy or place enemies in hard to reach vantage points as they suddenly pelt you from above. Levels are much larger this time around and there is a big focus on verticality. The verticality can be very annoying as you cannot look up to shoot at them unless you are playing Doom 2 via a source port that gives you mouse aiming. Even then it is quite a rush as you are surrounded on from all sides and are even being shot at from above lending the game the feel that you are really fighting for your survival.\n\nIn Doom 1 more often than not you felt like you were a badass but in Doom 2 you really get the feeling that you are just surviving as the slightest mistake can be the end of you. Many of the times you will not see the fight coming as the walls drop around you to reveal that you are indeed surrounded in a room that appeared safe. It is a lot more action oriented than the original that had the sounds and groans of the enemy far before you see it to give it a bit of a horror feel. In this it is a lot more in your face merely dropping enemies without much indication. Whichever you enjoy more is up to preference though in some occasions Doom 2 does end up feeling down right cheap. One other thing I am not too crazy about is the obscurely hidden keycards for a few levels. I usually ended up finding them while searching for secrets only to discover that is actually the right way to go. I can see many players being completely stuck in some levels and ending up searching for a walkthrough. Thankfully most of the levels do not have obscure level design and flow rather well with you knowing where to go at all times.\n\nAll of the items make a return like the hazmat suit, night vision and soul spheres with no new additions. Secrets are still plentiful and more important than ever as finding a crate of rare ammo can be the difference between life or death down the road. If you die you start at the beginning of the level with only a pistol like in the original Doom. Environments were very impressive for their time featuring giant cities with skyscrapers and tons of things on screen. I still find it rather cool even today as everything you see will eventually be explored and is not just set dressing. Being able to fight in a large nonlinear city, shooting rockets while running faster than Sonic the Hedgehog is a lost art in modern FPS games sadly. Music is strangely enough no longer guitar shredding Metal and is instead a more laid back Industrial Techno sounding type of genre. It is strange as Doom 2 is a lot more action packed than the original and yet is the one with music that doesn't get you pumped. It has some really good tracks nonetheless and is really just up to personal preference. Controls have been modernized and has movement set to “WASD” with the mouse controls allowing you to look left and right. Pushing the mouse forward causes your character to walk forward which is annoying and cannot be disabled without the use of a mod.\n\nYour main mission is to help the remnants of humanity off the planet before being completely wiped out. Eventually you succeed in your mission and lay down your gun, sit back and wait for death while proud of the fact that you saved humanity. You get a call telling you that they found where the demons are pouring in from and you wearily stand back up to continue the fight. It sounds a lot better than it is to be honest. Story is minimal and you only get a bit of text from time to time. Like pretty much any other shooter at the time it is all about gameplay and it is still as fun now as it was back then. It is the same timeless gameplay from Doom 1 but with the addition of plenty of new powerful demons and much harder levels. If you liked Doom this is really more of the same only bigger, badder and more likely to make you John Romero's b****. At the low price it is now being sold at it is more than worth it to take a trip back to memory lane or to any fan of fast and frantic FPS action that's willing to look past the dated graphics. So rev up your chainguns and mow down demons until you are knee deep in the dead.","January 22","true","0.2"," 19 of 22 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","19","22","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kingsigy/recommended/2300/","kingsigy","KingSigy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kingsigy/","526 products in account","Doom was a series that blew me away when I was younger. I was born right before the advent of 3D gaming, so I grew up with the progression from 16-bit to 32-bit and then full on polygonal games. It felt like technology was moving so fast and that I was at the cusp of creativity.\n\nEven though Super Mario 64 had changed how I viewed gaming, Doom came into my life and changed what I thought of my PC. I now wanted to master the keyboard and mouse so that I could become a Doom god. I eventually got my own PC and Doom became my best friend.\n\nWhat I found was, I had a stronger fondness for Doom II. I couldn't explain it then, but I felt like the game was more intense. It seemed to move faster, had bigger levels and a greater variety of enemies. Even if it bared resemblance to the original Doom, it felt like a totally different game.\n\nI can now explain why I felt such a way. ID Software were always looking to outdo themselves. All of the creators had become masters of their own game, so they looked on how to up the challenge. Throwing simply more enemies would be cheap, but it also could work with some slight modifications to the gunplay.\n\nThis brought about the Super Shotgun (or Double Barrell), which has such a significant impact on combat scenarios and level design. Since you basically have a gun that is close range with the damage of a rocket launcher (and no splash damage), you can destroy lesser foes in a single shot.\n\nIt turns some of the drawn out encounters from the first game into lightning fast executions. You can clear out rooms of weaklings in mere seconds, where the original Doom required you to carefully plan out whom to attack first. That does still factor into Doom II, what with the enemies retaining their simplistic designs and the new enemies being super deadly; the change is now that there are dramatically more enemies.\n\nThe levels are much larger than anything from the first game, so you will encounter hundreds of foes in single levels. Your  arsenal will grow over the course of the game and you'll eventually find yourself with a large amount of ammunition. If nothing was done to even the odds, you'd be overpowered within 5 levels.\n\nWhile not every map is a masterpiece, the majority of this game has more in-depth designs. Vertical spacing is delved into; differing level heights play a bigger role; there are even some gimmick levels that throw large bosses at you with a small puzzle to kill them. It's definitely not just bigger = better.\n\nThe game also does away with Episode selection and has you play all 30 levels back to back. If you get good at the game, you end up never losing your inventory. Most of the levels have ammo backpacks, so even if you do die, you're never left underpowered. You may run out of ammo, though.\n\nThe newer enemies help flesh out the roster a bit. The original game nearly blows it's entire line-up in the first Episode, saving the really big bosses for the later levels. Doom II introduces one weaker version of a previous enemy (the Hell Knight) and some real pain in the ♥♥♥, priority targets.\n\nThe Mancubus is basically a walking tank with double rocket launchers; the Pain Elemental acts as a mobile spawning point; the Revenant is hyper fast and strong (though with low health); finally, the Chaingun Guy has impeccable accuracy and speed with his chaingun. It introduces a more steady difficulty curve that doesn't need to reset at the start of every 8 or so levels (like how the original Doom handled it).\n\nThe Steam version of Doom II is also limited to being a DOSBox emulation (much like it's predecessor), so that does suck. With the aid of a source port, you can also get some co-op going. You can even clean up the visuals a bit and add some more modernized controls.\n\nOverall, Doom II may not be as brilliantly made as the first game. I still enjoy the combat and larger levels more, but there is a sense that ID Software got a bit too ambitious. Regardless of that, there is no reason to pass up on playing this.\n\n9/10","May 16","true","22.1"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","8","8","0","0"

If you want to read my opinion about new " Doom" it's on bottom.\n\nI really suggest you to buy this , one of the very first FPS games to come out. If you enjoyed first Doom then surely you will enjoy Doom 2. Every single has played Doom in their lives , if the haven't they need to fix their lives. Doom is my childhood a game where i enjoyed killing people as a kid. Propaply a reason why I wnt to shrink a couple of times.\n\nSadly this game won't run my new PC i see many people have problems with that. Well can't blame the since game is over 20 years old.\n\nIf you hate this game , not even doctors could help or even save you. You are just a lost cause. You have to re-ask yourself a meaning of your life.\n\nMy opinion about new " Doom "\n\nThis is some Halo ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t right here just with " doom " demons. They should have just remastered Doom 3 basiclly or even better good old original Doom. This just dosen't feel like Doom anymore and not to mention that our legendary Doomguy now looks like Masterchief a bit , maybe too much. Just dont buy this rather save up your money and buy original dooms which are cheaper and 100x times better then this.\n\nI have been fan of Doom for a very VERY long time and i find this insulting Doom franchise . they basiclly ruined Doom with this is what im trying to say and to me this will never be Doom.\n\nThe only people who will find this " awesome 100 times better then original Doom " and stuff like that are either trolls . not Doom fans or just 12 year old kids who never even seen original Doom.","March 6, 2015","true","3.6"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","8","10","2","0"

This gives you 32 generally great new levels, a new weapon (the Super Shotgun - a double-barreled shotgun), and adds a number of new monsters that serve to elevate the gameplay even further.\n\nAnd...that's it. It's honestly more of an expansion than a sequel. But trust me when I say that the game is all the more better for it, because pretty much every addition is an improvement. Doom fans view this as the pinnacle of classic Doom, and custom level designers have generally used it in lieu of the first game since it came out. Not that the first game is bad; with the lack of Doom II's new features it becomes an experience all its own. But if you get the first one, you'd do extremely well to grab its sequel as well.\n\nJust don't play it with the included DOSBox emulator. What you're paying for is DOOM2.WAD - the game file itself. If you want a high quality experience, download Chocolate Doom if you want the closest thing to pure Doom, ZDoom if you want to easily play custom levels and mods, or Skulltag if you want to try multiplayer. Given how many of the aforementioned mods and custom levels there are, how many are still being made to this day, and how many good ones there are of varying types and stripes, you'd better believe it when I say it's worth it.","July 31, 2014","true","0.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

This game is still good after 20 years! Yes it shows it's age but the gameplay and level design (not to meation the kick @$$ soundtrack) all made up for the graphics. Even then the graphics are appealing to look unlike the gray, unispired modern day shooters.\nWeapons are easy to switch between and like in Serious Sam and Duke Nukem (That were inspired by this game) you'll find yourself switching weapons on the fly. Use Shotgun on the Imps, chaingun on Picky demons, BFG on cybor demon, etc. And with many types of enemies you'll have to learn what gun works best or'll you'll have a bad type.\nThe story is almost non-existant with John Carmack thinking that stories in games weren't important (Oh John we would not have been friends) but like the graphics can be forgiven for the great gameplay overall.\nSo should you buy? Sure. You might need to fix a few files because of DOS box but the steam forms have many a soultion for you. So what are you waiting for? Buy it and kill some demons all ready!","October 11, 2014","true","6.6"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

But somewhere, inside of me, I still have a large amount of young nostalgia in me, and this happens to be a highlighted game for me. You won't be able to find any good old-school FPS games better than DOOM, Ultimate DOOM, DOOM II, and Final DOOM. All of these games, including Id Software's other games, have been in my life forever, and always will. You must get this game if you also have that nostalgia that I have, and even get it if you have never played the game before. Especially if you play games like COD, and would like to try a new game. The gameplay is phenomonal, and the replay value is also great through the majority of the game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Megasan/recommended/2300/","Megasan","Megasan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Megasan/","543 products in account","Fight your way threw waves of monsters invading earth in this PC cult classic. Doom II has set the way for PC gaming since the 90's and it's still one of the most if not THE most cult classic PC game ever made.\n\nGame play: 9 out of 10\n\nBeing a game from the 90's doesn't stop this game from having some of the best game play for it's time. It may not be Call of Duty, or Half-life but it has really solid game. Doom II is the “Guns! Guns! Even more guns!” kinda of game play. Doom II is a simple a first person shooter, you move, you shoot, you get keys, to unlocked doors and find hidden stuff. Nothing over the top. However back in the 90's it didn't matter. It how many guns can I use to take out these monsters.\n\nWhile Doom has it fair share of weapons, It has a great design of monsters monsters and more monsters! Everything from your basic zombie soldier, to huge ♥♥♥ cyber demons ready to rip you apart at a moments notice. Each monster has there own style of game play. Some has simple things like a shot gun, or a melee attack, Some have more magical powers like fireballs or setting you on fire, while some are Cybernetic enhanced demons using rocket launchers or having a spider body with a chain gun on it. Whatever the case maybe this game doesn't sell you short on the fun factor.\n\nDoom also uses the color key/door system. Meaning you have to search around from room to room finding these keys to advance in each level. In Doom II you do not have to really Aim at the targets it pretty much aims for you by using an auto aim system since you can't really look up and down and such. Pretty much means you can be standing on top of something and shoot something below you and not even be aiming or looking at it. There are ways to change this of course but please read blow for more info on that.\n\nThe maps are very well design, with each one having a different theme to them. However unlike games now of days one level leads into the next which leads into the next one Doom doesn't really have a set “level” design on how you go from one map to the next map. It's pretty much like an episodic tv show where you have the “flavor” or “theme” of the day. Here it's more so the “Flavor” or “theme” of the map.\n\nThere are a decent amount of power ups, You have Berserk mode, Radioactive suit, full map, and more. Each adds a little bit more to the game play element which adds even more fun to the game as it is.\n\nStory: 5 out of 10.\n\nDoom it's self has a good story... if you read the novels and such however the game it's self gives you a more simple smaller version of the story. There isn't much there to really work with. It's mainly about demons and monster that have came from hell that are invading earth and it's your job to stop it. Short and simple. This game isn't about the over all story as it is. It's mainly about kill everything that gets in your way.\n\nGraphics: 9 out of 10.\n\nOf course the graphics are pretty bad compare to games now but for it's time they where amazing. It's a 3D game with 2d rending sprites. Every NPC and items around the maps them self’s are 2D sprites that “follows” you. Pretty much whenever you step left or right it will turn and keep looking at you. While there are times when the graphics of NPC's and items can look flat by the way you are looking at them, but doesn't effect the game play.\n\nThe over all graphics are set to be more Gorey/ Horror themed with a dark gloomy setting. While a lot of maps focus on a certain theme for each one, you can get the over all feel they where going for.\n\nMusic: 10 out of 10.\n\nThis music in this game is amazing. For being midi files it is top notice. The music is midi version of song like Master of Puppets by metallica to other big named bands. The sound track will have to coming back for more. Doom has one of the best sound tracks in history for video games.\n\nExtra: Mods and such:\n\nTil this day Doom is the most modded PC game ever. People are still making maps, skins, game mods, movies, and more much. This show you have much love this game has gotten over the years.\n\nNow there are some mods that I personally use that i recommend to people to enhance your game play better if you so choose.\n\nThe mods I use are as followed:\n\nBrutal Doom\nZandronum (single player and online).\n\nBrutal Doom takes the game and makes it even more Gorey and well brutal. This enhance the game play by adding more weapons, Alt fires for every weapons, Finishers, Harder mode settings, and much more. If you looking for one of the best mods out there for doom check out Brutal Doom mod. After installing this mod I can't go back to the basic doom game anymore.\n\nZandronum, is a mod that allows more enhanced game play to let you have free camra look, to allowing you to aim and not use auto aim. Allowing online play with friends or random people you meet or find on servers. There are a lot of different one like this out there. I use this one because it was recommended by Brutal doom for a better game play.\n\nOther mods:\nSkin mods\nMaps\nGuns\nPower Ups\nGame modes\n\nThese are some of the thing you can find, Skins for weapons, or NPC's. Maps from doom style maps to playing inside walmart or McDonalds. Guns, so when you get tired of the normal guns you can just add more! I mean who doesn't want the Rick Roll BoomBox gun Mod? Anyone? Anyone? Even more power ups and more game mods. There are so many mods out there that there are web sites dedicated to just that.\n\nCheat does:\n\nThere are a decent list of codes that can be use to give you powers like God mode, All weapons, Noclip and such. I don't recommend using them unless you have play this game so much that you're looking to spice things up a bit.\n\nCheat Engine:\n\nThis is a bit off for what I am reviewing. However I have used cheat engine to enhance my game play allowing more than what you can do in the game it's self. There are options in game that allows faster monsters, and respawning monster which is can be hard enough as it is. However I like to turn speed hack on and give myself x2 speed while giving the monster even more speed. It adds more of a challenge to the game and I don't recommend this to everyone unless your looking for a challenge.\n\nI know when I started playing doom back in the 90's for the first time. 5 year old me had so many nightmares because of this game but I couldn't put it down and ever since then I have forever loved doom.  Doom was my first ever FPS game and because of doom, FPS games have become my personal favorite style of video games.\n\nOverall score: 9.5 out of 10.\n\nDespite not having much of a story being there is. It makes up with everything else. If your looking for a story based game I wouldn't recommend this game to you. However if you want something insanely fun that's mindless then I recommend this game.\n\nIf you are new to Doom or never heard of it, You SHOULD do your self a favor and play this game.","February 16, 2015","true","0.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

Each adds a little bit more to the game play element which adds even more fun to the game as it is.\n\nStory: 5 out of 10.\n\nDoom it's self has a good story... if you read the novels and such however the game it's self gives you a more simple smaller version of the story. There isn't much there to really work with. It's mainly about demons and monster that have came from hell that are invading earth and it's your job to stop it. Short and simple. This game isn't about the over all story as it is. It's mainly about kill everything that gets in your way.\n\nGraphics: 9 out of 10.\n\nOf course the graphics are pretty bad compare to games now but for it's time they where amazing. It's a 3D game with 2d rending sprites. Every NPC and items around the maps them self’s are 2D sprites that “follows” you. Pretty much whenever you step left or right it will turn and keep looking at you. While there are times when the graphics of NPC's and items can look flat by the way you are looking at them, but doesn't effect the game play.\n\nThe over all graphics are set to be more Gorey/ Horror themed with a dark gloomy setting. While a lot of maps focus on a certain theme for each one, you can get the over all feel they where going for.\n\nMusic: 10 out of 10.\n\nThis music in this game is amazing. For being midi files it is top notice. The music is midi version of song like Master of Puppets by metallica to other big named bands. The sound track will have to coming back for more. Doom has one of the best sound tracks in history for video games.\n\nExtra: Mods and such:\n\nTil this day Doom is the most modded PC game ever. People are still making maps, skins, game mods, movies, and more much. This show you have much love this game has gotten over the years.\n\nNow there are some mods that I personally use that i recommend to people to enhance your game play better if you so choose.\n\nThe mods I use are as followed:\n\nBrutal Doom\nZandronum (single player and online).\n\nBrutal Doom takes the game and makes it even more Gorey and well brutal. This enhance the game play by adding more weapons, Alt fires for every weapons, Finishers, Harder mode settings, and much more. If you looking for one of the best mods out there for doom check out Brutal Doom mod. After installing this mod I can't go back to the basic doom game anymore.\n\nZandronum, is a mod that allows more enhanced game play to let you have free camra look, to allowing you to aim and not use auto aim. Allowing online play with friends or random people you meet or find on servers. There are a lot of different one like this out there. I use this one because it was recommended by Brutal doom for a better game play.\n\nOther mods:\nSkin mods\nMaps\nGuns\nPower Ups\nGame modes\n\nThese are some of the thing you can find, Skins for weapons, or NPC's. Maps from doom style maps to playing inside walmart or McDonalds. Guns, so when you get tired of the normal guns you can just add more! I mean who doesn't want the Rick Roll BoomBox gun Mod? Anyone? Anyone? Even more power ups and more game mods. There are so many mods out there that there are web sites dedicated to just that.\n\nCheat does:\n\nThere are a decent list of codes that can be use to give you powers like God mode, All weapons, Noclip and such. I don't recommend using them unless you have play this game so much that you're looking to spice things up a bit.\n\nCheat Engine:\n\nThis is a bit off for what I am reviewing. However I have used cheat engine to enhance my game play allowing more than what you can do in the game it's self. There are options in game that allows faster monsters, and respawning monster which is can be hard enough as it is. However I like to turn speed hack on and give myself x2 speed while giving the monster even more speed. It adds more of a challenge to the game and I don't recommend this to everyone unless your looking for a challenge.\n\nI know when I started playing doom back in the 90's for the first time. 5 year old me had so many nightmares because of this game but I couldn't put it down and ever since then I have forever loved doom.  Doom was my first ever FPS game and because of doom, FPS games have become my personal favorite style of video games.\n\nOverall score: 9.5 out of 10.\n\nDespite not having much of a story being there is. It makes up with everything else. If your looking for a story based game I wouldn't recommend this game to you. However if you want something insanely fun that's mindless then I recommend this game.\n\nIf you are new to Doom or never heard of it, You SHOULD do your self a favor and play this game.","February 16, 2015","true","0.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/praisecheadle/recommended/2300/","praisecheadle","c5","http://steamcommunity.com/id/praisecheadle/","1138 products in account","Doom 2 is a classic that maintains its fun to this day. At first glance, it looks very similar to Doom 1, using many of the same graphics, the same gunplay, and the same arsenal (plus the new double barrelled shotgun). Where this game differs from its predecessor is in the level design and overall flow of the combat. Whereas Doom 1 was very mazelike and encounters were more personal with a handful of enemies, this game frequently drops you in huge, open areas and sometimes throws dozens of enemies at you at once. The double barrelled shotgun changes the fight dynamics a great deal. Where the Pink demons were a challenge in the first game, they can be dispatched with one blast, and other enemies that were difficult to deal with are similarly cut down to size. To compensate for this, Doom 2 introduces a handful of new, more offensively focused enemies, such as the mancubus and revenant, which shoot rockets at you, and the archvile that catches you on fire and resurrects the dead. The effect that all of this has is that encounters in Doom 2 are usually more intense and challenging. As is the case in every classic Id software game, the level design is brilliant and encourages a kind of exploration you just don't get in today's FPS games. The levels are large and sprawling, but the clever design gives each level a sense of direction and flow, so you generally know where to go next. I can think of exactly two spots where the way to continue was overly obtuse (for those interested:  there was a keycard hidden in a very obscure place in the level "Refueling Base" and having to shoot part of the wall to open a door in a level called "The Spirit World" ). Still, two bad spots in a campaign that lasts about 9 hours total isn't bad at all. Visually, this game is very obviously old, and yet I still find it pleasant to look at. If you really must have modern graphics, there are plenty of mods to accomplish that, but the aesthetic of this game is so well realized that it's beautiful to look at thanks to the downright surreal and creative art direction.The singleplayer experience of Doom 2 stays fun for the entire duration of the game and is an absolute joy to play.\n\nEven though this game is 20 years old, the multiplayer scene is surprisingly strong thanks to the fact that iD software released the engine's source code for free, allowing people to create programs such as Zandronum and ZDaemon (both of which I reccomend highly for multiplayer) that allow players to connect with ease. The deathmatch mode of Doom 2 is hands down one of the most fun deathmatch games I've ever played. Everyone moves ridiculously fast and you will initially find yourself getting lost in a volley of rockets and shotgun blasts. The deathmatch gets so chaotic that it can become almost incomprehensible at times, but I find myself getting used to it after a few rounds and eventually making sense of it all. There are no perks or killstreaks here, just pure reflexes and strategy. Knowing which weapon to use in which situations is key for survival and the game is surprisingly accessible for new players as long as you just practice (despite playing singleplayer Doom games for a long time, I just started playing Doom multiplayer this year and generally hold my own in matches and manage to win every now and then). Co-Operative modes are also very popular and even though I prefer deathmatch, there is tons of fun to be had in co-op (one defense-based mod in particular gives you money for every demon you defeat, which allows you to purchase buildings for a base you have to protect, which is pretty fun).\n\nThere are a ton of user-made mods and maps available to try out as well, so purchasing this game (although I would really encourage getting the whole series as well) is a great investment as you will get acces to a great amount of content.","August 5, 2014","true","10.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Sequall to Ulitmate DOOM I think this game is no waste of money but, the dos box emulator for this game sucks so you will have to use source ports.I recommend the zdoom source port because it still fells your playing the original game when you use it also, you can make the game a bit modren by adding, jump,crouch,and swimming in the controls.Works great on windows 8.Before I forget when i bought this game it came with the master levels.Overall i give this game a 10/10 because of the outstanding levels,new textures, and the super shootgun.If you are a Doom fan this game is a must buy","July 20, 2014","true","9.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Today, I can still play it and have a blast. The game is obviously very old school but that does not make it bad. It is very fast paced and is very unforgiving at times. Some would call this a 'dumb gorefest', but from a design prespective, the game is very smart with some of its puzzles and map layouts and enemy placement. Vanilla, this game is still a blast. But, with a certain mod called Brutal Doom, this game is reborn and modernized while still keeping the fundamentals of Doom. This game with Brutal Doom is some of the best fun I have ever had. I would highly reccomend this game even if youre slightly interested in the games that helped form the FPS's of today. I would give this game vanilla 9/10. With Brutal Doom, 20/10.","August 9, 2014","true","7.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lotica/recommended/2300/","lotica","Lotica","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lotica/","991 products in account","I have mixed feelings on DOOM II as a whole. My main gripe really is that the game doesn't feel too different from the original in terms of gameplay. I'm not talking about the new weapons and enemies, I'm just mainly talking about what you have to do and what not. It doesn't feel like a proper sequel. However, that's okay. DOOM II does what it needs to do. The new enemies are a real challenge, the Super Shotgun is a blast to use, and the easter egg levels are a nice touch. The only other complaint is that the level design doesn't feel as polished as the first three episodes of the original DOOM. They get a bit tedious to explore after awhile. I mean I love DOOM II, but I just don't find it as impressive as the original. However, I would say get it anyways, especially if you're going to play mods, as a lot of mods these days use DOOM II as the base game.","May 29","true","0.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Not the first FPS, but I could say it's "The First Bad@$$ FPS Ever. PERIOD". Why the 2 rates? Let's say the 10/10 rate is related to the Game itself (or every Pros I've though of and listed) while the 0/10 is related to the Game As a Steam Release (Everything is listed in the Cons Section). Consider that I grew up with doom, I was 6 years old when the shareware was being widespread all over the world, and still nowadays I own The original DooM, DooM II and The Ultimate Collection DooM 95 (With Ultimate DooM, DooM II And Final DooM). Despite all this I regret to NOT Recommend this RELEASE (Not THE GAME, mind you). On a Side note: all the DooM chapters have been released on Steam like this, so I'm not recommending Any other chapter, specifically The Ultimate DooM, Final DooM nor even the Master levels for DooM II. My same Review will be posted in all those releases because of the same flaws.\n\n+++PROs+++The Following Points are the reason I MUST recommend this GameFPS. The genre was defined by THIS game (Yes, yes, there was Wolfenstein before, but the mainstream came with DooM overwhelming popularity). I still feel Adrenaline while sporting around an arsenal of weapons through Maps totally full of monsters and a gameplay that can be summarized as "shoot (or run through) everything that moves and get to the exit". Sounds lame but everything started from here, and simpler things are not boring here. They're Fun.\nMUSIC. It's a widely known story and it's true. Most of the bad@$$ music you hear in game are nothing but ripoffs from famous Metal or Hard Rock famous songs. How could a game be more Bad@$$ than this?\nMODS. One of the most Modded game ever. There are even lots of Ports, because DooM originally is a DOS game so it always had few issues with windows' environment (mainly audio related, who remembers autoexec.bat, dos=high umb and other damn DOS lines like them? XD). Lots of famous mods, that can revolutionize the gameplay (like Brutal Doom), or even new maps (See Alien DooM), or totally messed up demented projects (like the Italian And somehow Satyrical/blatantly blasphemous Grezzo 2... I am told it's greatly appreciated around the world... even though most characters are italian or from italian Television, and everything is written/spoken in italian... so... O.o). There are even lots of guides, both in steam and in other sites, with solutions to all of the CONs I've listed.---CONs---The following points are the reason I will NEVER recommend this release on Steam. STEAM OVERLAY. This release runs directly with dosbox, so obviously the overlay won't work.\nTHE PORT. Actually this release has no ports... It's the usual game that runs on DosBox... Which is not the best solution because it's just an emulation of a DOS Environment which means that you can easily experience some minor LAGs, both on video and audio. Not to mention the inferior Midi quality. On top of that it has 2 options, the classic input and the DEFAULT "Modern input" with WASD Movement AND Mouse MOVEMENT...Not Mouselook, MOVEMENT. So obviously you can't use the mouse because it goes in conflict with the WASD keys... And you can't use the arrows because ONLY Left and Right are Binded... WHAT THE F**K?!?!?!?!? WHO THE HELL IS THE INCOMPETENT THAT WORKED ON THIS $H17 AND APPROVED IT?!?!?!?!? AND THIS C**P IS THE DEFAULT SETTING!!!! I know there are solutions inside steam's community discussions and guides, but I don't care, releasing a product of the importance as DooM in this state is SIMPLY RIDICULOUS. And you want to know something? Do you remember the Excellent DooM 95 Port where you have a simple window with tidy options and settings? You even have settings to add Mods. Do you know who worked on that project in his Microsoft's days? GABE NEWELL. And here on Steam I have to find this Garbage on DosBox... I could have Downloaded from google in 2 minutes both the WADs AND a DECENT Port IF (i repeat) IF MY ORIGINAL COPIES  Of DooM, DooM II And "Ultimate Doom, DooM II And Final With DooM 95" (Yes I DO OWN ALL OF THEM) were somehow misteriously Burnt out... Steam doesn't consider profitable to ask microsoft a deal to use the best BASIC port for DooM? Fine, Use another one, or make something decent yourself, it's really ridiculous to get such a great game released in such a bad and approximate way... And maybe I'm mistaken, Steam is just a digital distribution platform and the quality of the product released relies on the Developer. It doesn't change anything. The fact that Whoever worked on this release setted the game to play by default with a SELF-CONTRADICTORY INPUT SYSTEM is still RIDICUOUS ... And a reason BIG ENOUGH to AVOID this release LIKE A DISEASE... (Ho-ho-ho, I'm a poet... XD... But seriously, don't waste here your money...)","February 2","false","0.4"," 22 of 43 people (51%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","51","22","43","3","0"

It has BIGGER maps, with MORE enemies, and at some point, MORE complicated puzzles that puts you in confusion on where to go and what to find.\n\nThe 1st Doom is hard, but this is HARDER. The game is hard as HELL on highest difficulty, and you have to fight through hell (literally) to beat the level. Of course all i said was from highest difficulty i played, so to those who are hardcore gamers, i say try this.\n\nOf course the set up is oldschool, so if you dont know then get to know it because its not really that hard once you understand the concept of oldschool setups (such as typing in notepad on the file, etc.).\n\nI'll admit the setup is quite boring, but the gameplay is where it'll ALWAYS keep your eyes widened and keep you going.\n\nUpdate: This game I would strongly recommend it because you can play with certain modifications like zDoom or gzDoom (in my case, I played gzDoom). Get it, its free to download and you are required to get this game in order to play it especially on modern computers alongside modern controls if you cant handle the classic stuff.\n\nFurthermore you can also play mods. For me, I play modded campaigns. So meaning, new levels and probably new story as well depending which mods you are playing. The challenge is very interesting too. If you want mods, I would usually either check Moddb or google the name of the mods. Or check youtube if you wish to see how it goes, especially typing "Doom mods" or "Top Doom wads".\n\nI will promise you, the day you start playing mods like this you will likely will never see the sun again. Experience wise, beated about over 20 mods (wads) and majority of them is megawads (which usually holds 32 levels (30 without secrets)). It has everything you need to make Doom modern (well except graphics of course lol). Like the ability to look up and down, or change controls through game, etc.\n\nBut yeah, get this, then download the modification. If you havent beat the original, you can either do it now after purchase or get gzDoom (again if you cant handle the classic controls).\n\nYou can do all that just from buying this game, so go for it if you want to do all this awesome stuff.","January 28, 2015","true","17.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The monster variety is insane, and will leave you constantly surprised to see new enemies. If the game gets too hard, get a few friends to team up and coop with you.

Had to mess around with files to get the DOSBox client not to crash at the title screen, which peeved me a little.  Get into the game and moving the mouse forward makes me run forward!  This wasn't a thing with Doom95, but again, I have to go Google a solution(another download).\n\nFinally, I'm not sure how to run other .WADs without even more noodling around - Doom95 let you pick a WAD in the autorun screen.  This?  Nope, just boots the DOSBox client and you're into Doom2.WAD or whatever the default WAD is.  You'd have to import the mod into the directory and rename it to Doom2.WAD every time you want to change WADs, I guess.\n\nI owned Doom II on CD as a kid, came with Doom95, and you just ran the client and in you went, no hassle.  This was the late '90s-early 2000s.  Yet instead of using that, they decide to package the DOS version...I got this in a package with the first Doom(which, again, already beat on the 360 but figured it'd be nice to play on the PC), Final Doom and Master Levels for Doom II(which I didn't own) and they're all the same way(I could do the WAD-swap trick I mentioned up there).  Classic games, but the porting job?...ouch!  At $5, I'm not sure I'm in any position to complain, but...couldn't they have at least used the Doom95 client instead of the DOS version?","July 19, 2014","true","3.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Now I'm going to give a reason why Doom II gets an even better score from me.\n\nDoom II continues with Doomguy carrying on the long fight with the demons, this time on Earth. It doesn't differ that much from its predecessor, that I can admit. No big changes to the gameplay nor the graphics. However I am a bit (or should I say very) biased towards the second game since it's  also the first one I played from the franchise. It's one of the earliest games I saw, one of the earliest games I played and one of the few favourite games I love. This game defined my childhood.\n\nYou can consider my review of the first Doom apply in here as well. But setting aside my bias I also think the levels in the second game are more memorable and there's a couple new enemies and also more tougher enemies to kill. It's like Halo 2 to Halo: Combat Evolved or Left 4 Dead 2 to Left 4 Dead. I tend to like the sequels a little more.\n\nPersonal Rating: 5/5 - One of my favourite\nOnce again, game time shows only 0.1 minute because of launching the game from the files through a source port.","May 11","true","0.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

You have a little tiny bit of installer work to do, but once you do, it's totally worth the price.There's mods that simply improve the games mechanics and graphics, to mods that completely overhaul and change the game. They stretch far and wide, from anime-style demon slaying action, magic spells, punching people in the face, MAP PACKS, and of course straight up rip and tear brutality. The community has kept this game alive. On some particular mods, like Zandronum, the game even has an active multiplayer community. Wow.\n\nYou need to buy this game for the mods, by the way.

How bad? No OpenGL/DirectX. Software Rendering Only. Locked 480p 4:3 Resolution. Good luck getting it to find your mouse or joypad either. This is only worth buying for the data files, which you should proceed to use in a newer Source Port engine.\n\nCalling this a port at all is outright dishonest. This crap got shoved onto steam when Bethesda got the Id catalog, and it's an outdated unpatched dos version running in an emulator. In no way is this a Windows NT port, but a disgusting cashgrab by Bethesda using a DOS emulator they also didn't develop.\n\nAny other avenue for legally acquiring those files is better than this. This is an awful hackjob that no one should support Bethesda with. If you don't believe me, go look at Super Noah's Ark 3-D. There is nothing preventing these games from running the way they should but Bethesda.\n\nIf you buy this and don't leave an extremely negative review, you are personally contributing to these bad ports on steam. Any and all encouragement to buy this by Curators should be met with extreme distrust and assumption of shilling. You can't play this as it ships and leave with a good impression unless you are a fool completely ignorant of PC Gaming and DOOM. As someone who has spent hundreds of hours playing DOOM, as someone who considers DOOM 1 to be in the high end of their Top 5 Games of All Time and DOOM 2 in their Top 10, this is not how you should experience doom.

The game hasn't changed, but it's packaged in a way that provides the worst possible Doom experience: it uses DOSBox instead of a modern, cross-platform source port.  It would take some intern at Zenimax about a day to repackage the game for Win/Mac/Lin with such a port, and not much more effort to include a nice launcher for custom WADs, etc.  There is really no excuse for them not having done this, and I will happily change my review if/when they do.","May 24, 2013","false","0.0"," 29 of 72 people (40%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","40","29","72","2","0"

From the files that you get from Steam, you can't adjust the controls at all.  From what I can tell, in order to get a playable game, you are expected to find and download third-party software by yourself.  If you don't know where to find a website that you trust to download software that won't end up being malware that destroys your computer, then you're out of luck.  The Xbox 360 version of Doom works perfectly with excelent controls.  If you want to play a game in the Doom series, I would highly reccomend buying it on a console instead of from Steam.","August 29, 2015","false","0.4"," 2 of 14 people (14%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","14","2","14","2","0"

While the game has absolutely aged over the last nearly 20 years, it is still an absolute blast to play. Before the days of linear, cinematic FPSes, the genre was fast-paced, pitting players in maze-like environment, forcing them to look for keys and buttons to open doors to unlock the exit before they met their demise. Weapons were awesome and unique, and the monsters were absolutely amazing. Every last monster was built out of clay and are turned into sprites, so the game looks a bit like a demented Robot Chicken skit. However, in the days of Windows 8 and whatnot, the game no longer works without a bit of setup. Luckily, there are guides on how to set up and configure everything so you can run the game on your new machines. The controls can feel a bit slippery, but overall the ultimate FPS still holds up today in all of its glory. If you are willing to drop a few dollars to experience history, then DOOM, or more specifically DOOM II, will be your gateway into the underworld.","December 18, 2013","true","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game is one of the grandfathers of FPS's and shows id Software at their absolute finest. I reccommend this game for nostalgia and for sheer fun factor. The graphics and playstyle still hold up to this very day. Though through the steam version it runs off DOSBox which isnt bad but for most cant seem to get it to work, which is why i see some people putting some bad reviews up for the game. If anything the information i can provide to you is to atleast buy the game for the WAD file (support id!) and download the mod for it Zanodrum this mod can help you play multiplayer as well as graphical improvments and gameplay improvements it supports other mods as well. I think what people dont understand though the game is 20 years old the modding community for it has grown even stronger. And is at the very most worth looking into for such a classic game that can be taken even further considering its age.

Everything that was great about Doom I, but multiplied times-ten. Doom II: Hell on Earth offers a lot more enemies, more maps, another weapon, and larger, more enjoyable maps.

Just make sure that you go ahead and grab a source port like Zdoom or Zandronium because the steam version does not let you configure any settings so you can only play with OPL Synthesiser music and you can't bind any keys.","December 6, 2015","true","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Back in those days, I spent hours trying to free enough base memory (DOS only gave you 640K) to play games like this.  After getting it running, the frame rate was really choppy and only playable in a reduced size window.  I remember seeing it on a 486 and being wow-ed seeing it run at full screen.  I also remember the first time seeing a chainsaw used as a weapon, which was really unheard of back in those days (Mortal Kombat had not hit the arcades yet).\nSo how does DOOM II hold up after all these years?  I will admit, when I started it up, it looked down right ugly running at full screen.  No joystick compatibility was a bummer as well.  I seem to remember my Gravis gamepad working on the original DOOM II back in the day, which I bought a Creative Labs Sound Blaster card specifically for the joystick port.  The level design seems to hold up well, and I still remembered many of the secret rooms.  I actually jumped a little when an imp popped out behind a hidden door, which I had forgotten about after all of these years.\nTo be honest, I had more fun playing this classic than playing any of the current FPS games.  You press enter, pick a difficulty, and you are playing.  In games these days, you have to sit through minutes and minutes of boring dialogue and cutscenes before you can do anything.  That why I always try to put players in the action as soon as possible in the games that I develop.","November 28, 2015","true","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game is one of the grandfathers of FPS's and shows id Software at their absolute finest. I reccommend this game for nostalgia and for sheer fun factor. The graphics and playstyle still hold up to this very day. Though through the steam version it runs off DOSBox which isnt bad but for most cant seem to get it to work, which is why i see some people putting some bad reviews up for the game. If anything the information i can provide to you is to atleast buy the game for the WAD file (support id!) and download the mod for it Zanodrum this mod can help you play multiplayer as well as graphical improvments and gameplay improvements it supports other mods as well. I think what people dont understand though the game is 20 years old the modding community for it has grown even stronger. And is at the very most worth looking into for such a classic game that can be taken even further considering its age. It's a Classic, and it Still has ton's of potential.","February 14, 2014","true","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The first thing I noticed about this game was that there were more textures, and a LOT more enemies. Levels have more depth to them, are much larger, and more often than not have well over 100 sprites onscreen. Sitting back in '94,this would've been pushing the limits of PCs, no longer being confined to small corridors and just a handful of enemies at a time. The only downside was the story, but the action-oriented gameplay perfected by ID software makes up for it, who seem to have had an everlasting obsession with the idea of being sent to Hell.\n\nDoom II also added 2 player co-operative (not present in the Steam version) building upon the 4 player deathmatch mode, supporting up to 16 players on one server! Basically, this game gives you a whole lot more of what the first Doom gave you.\n\nI'd give it a 9.5/10 considering the time it was made, it only loses points for story.","April 3, 2015","true","11.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

What is there to say that hasent been said already? Its a fantastic sequel to its original, keeping the same engine and adding new content and new challenge, with many more levels, but a sad lack of secret levels. When most people think of the doom franchise, this is the one where they turn their attention to, in my opinion the best of the originals, untill Doom 3D botched it up. (thanks 3d realms.) I aswell think that this is the game where the doom series reached its peek, with clever level design, an interesting final boss, a new weapon, and many new enemies and powerups. If you want to see where the FPS genre began, start here, its worth every cent. Also, dont let my 0.4 hours fool you. I have well over 300+ hours using a seprate engine calle (G)Zdoom, which makes the game more streamlined and easier to play.","December 14, 2014","true","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Foxysen/recommended/2300/","Foxysen","Foxysen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Foxysen/","1172 products in account","Doom 2 is a direct sequel to Doom, being released in 1994. Or you can count it as a stand-alone expansion pack. It doesn't change much.\nAlso, Steam version of Doom 2 comes with Master Levels, which should appear in your library. Well, at least this is what people say, I got whole bundle of Doom instead. It's quite a mixed bag of fan-made levels.\n\nNow, about how Steam version of this old game was handled. As bad as Ultimate Doom. First, DOSBox was configured in such way that it casues heavy lag to many. It can be fixed by editing conf files in the game's folder to use "Opengl" instead of "ddraw". Doesn't enable Steam overlay for some reason though.\nWhen you launch the game, it gives you a cchoice whetever to use classic control or WASD with mouse. Game also uses SoundBlaster instead of MIDI for music. If you want to configure your own control scheme or chooce another sound device, then tough luck, Setup.Exe was removed from files. Instead you will have to manually configure cfg files, putting numbers and figuring out which keyboard button corresponds to what number.\n\nNow, as noted, Doom 2 feels more like expansion pack then a totally new sequel. It still uses same main base of game, same weapons, monsters, engine. Instead of changing what already was there, it adds more to it. And seeing that Ultimate Doom is awesome, it's not a bad idea at all.\n\nWhat in general Doom 2 does is to buff up the challenge. It inroduces new enemies that fit "medium-tough" category that was lacking in Doom 1, including Reverants, skeletons who shoot rockets (some of which keep following you until they explode), Hell Knights, lighter version of Barons of Hell who were bosses of Episode 1 in Doom, mini versions of Spider Mastermind, who should be stun-locked in pain state with Chaingun, and even everybody's hated Archvile, who acts as occasional mini-boss. Few others as well, all bringing bigger variety and danger to otherwise weak common enemies of Doom 1. It also puts common enemies like zombies and imps into big crowds quite often. But it's all done because player got a new powerful weapon, getting buffed as well: Super Shotgun.\n\nSuper Shotgun isn't just alternative to Shotgun in a game, it's as good as becoming main weapon and replacement to shotgun, even taking over same slot. It delivers a wide pack of punch, with triple more damage than shotgun, being almost like a close-quarter rocket hit. The only small flaws is just slightly longer reload and that it uses two shotgun shells as ammo, but shells are so common in Doom 2 levels that it doesn't become issue at all.\nAll it means that you can easily take down crowds of common enemies which could be quite an challenge in Doom 1, changing balance. It also makes some other weapons, like Berserk fist, Chainsaw, Pistol and Shotgun pretty much useless by comparison, so much for balance between weapons. You sure would use chaingun only to stunlock Spiders and such.\n\nAnd Doom 2 bring new, bigger and more complex levels, all 30 of them. More confusing too. Supposedly, the action now takes place on Earth, but seeing how level design is still highly abstract and non-sensial, you wouldn't be able to tell that. Outside of very few "city" levels, that are huge space with cubes. And well, to be honest, level design isn't on par to Doom 1, especially when it comes to looks. Doom 2 levels is mostly concentrated on being challenging and giving it "gotcha" moments, with many ambushes, they have more space to walk around too. And some of the ways that you are supposed to solve the puzzles aren't always obvious. You are supposed to shoot the door instead of using it, you know. Or having to drop down the acid to press the button that you probably don't see from above. It's not pleasent. And yes, it still has moments where game forces you to run over acid, making you take some damage. Or just teleport into small room with four imps from all sides.\n\nSpeaking of unpleasent, this game looks worse than the first Doom. The color pallete choice is quite ugly and the rendering of light doesn't help in this case. The usual variety of bright color (that was working excellent with lighting that was making them darker) is gone from most levels, after Map 4 you the only kind of texture choice you will be seeing is dirty ones. Black metal, brown wood, brown bricks. Even new monsters use brown as main color. And they say that WW2 shooters were the most brown ones. So yes, it looks worse.\n\nAs for music, it still delivers. Less memoriable pieces, but it does give give game soem personality. Exploration in hell of these brownness. But yes, music is excellent, not all rocking, but still, has some evil sound to it.\n\nSecret levels also should be mentioned. Even back then iD Software started to reference to their older games, and thus all two secrets levels are Wolf 3D levels, even including blue nazi enemies from there, which happily get killed by mightier Doom guy. And yes, unlike BFG Edition on Steam, these ones weren't censored.\n\nMutliplayer doesn't seem to be implented in Steam version, so you should use Zandronum source port for that.\n\nSo yes, I can recommend this game, as it's still an awesome FPS. Compared to Doom, it's much more meaty, killing dozens, and core gameplay got improved with new enemies to challenge you in various ways. On other hand, level design, both in looks and maze-gameplay, took a hit and aren't on par with original.\n\n\nBut we talked about game itself, as there is another phenomena of Doom 2: Modding. Doom2.wad is a file that is often used as a base for almost every mod, and Doom modding is where most people go, making use of simple engine for their maps or even dream games\nIf you want to mod or enjoy them, then you should get this one for sure.\nAnd then you will be able to play many various mods, whether it's Brutal Doom (that changes gameplay and then you have people thinking that Doom is about tons of gore and other teenager/new-school stuff), some other spammy mod, complete conversions or a multiplayer mods, like Zombie Horde (because zombies HAVE to be everywhere), All Out Of War 2 (Like that C&C FPS game, 1v1 me) or Ghouls Vs Humans...\nWait, GvH was good one.

If you like your demon-hunting bloody and lighting quick, look to no other game; although I should mention the game is two decades old and counting. The graphics are certaintly nothing to scream about. However, they don't impede the frame rate which is always brisk for the quick actions needed to survive the hellish landscape. If you've played and beaten the first game this is just like it gameplay-wise except with larger levels, new weapons, and enemies. I'd recommend playing it on the second-to-last difficult level for the ultimate challenge. No other games quite compare to the feeling of being chased by a bunch of imps and thinking you are opening a door to a respite only to spring forth a trap of chaingun dudes ripping your flesh apart. **** (STARS) out of **** (STARS)","March 4, 2014","true","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The Doom community offers far superior alternatives, with Zdoom letting you change everything from text size and color to the freaking midi device running.\n\nDOOM and DOOM II are the best shooters ever made, and will remain the best for a very, VERY long time.","March 7","true","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Then, for my surprise, there was this new game called "Doom 2" which I discovered at my cousin's home, but I still couldn't help to ask myself: "But what about the first game? I might be living under a rock, after all". Anyway, it was extremely fun and although back then I didn't have much patience to play it as it was meant to be, I'd just screw around with some cheat codes, which helped me to easily beat the game. Then time passed by and I've noticed that some fans released a few really interesting mods, like this one that would convert the guns into DBZ powers, something that made me revisit Doom 2. Well, who knows, time carried on once more and eventually I've met this game here on Steam. This time I decided to take things seriously, so I've finally managed to beat the game without cheating, finally putting an end to this story. Overall, yes it's an old game and yes, it can't be compared with the recent FPS. Nonetheless, it's a classic and will always have a charm of its own.","September 26, 2015","true","5.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a good game, but it lacks some of the artful cohesion that made the original DOOM so great. The original game did a lot better at telling a story through its level design and gameplay. The levels in DOOM II, by contrast, feel much more abstract, and feel more engineered to antagonize the player than the original DOOM. That said, the mechanics are (for better or worse) exactly the same as the first game, adding one new gun and a host of new upper-mid-tier enemies. There's plenty of great levels here, all things considered, it's just a shame that the sequel to DOOM feels more like a fan-made expansion pack than a full-fledged sequel.\n\nPresentation-wise, the Steam version of the game runs through DosBOX, which is serviceable, but feels a little low-effort. Fortunately, the game files are all there, so it's not difficult at all to find a source port to suit one's tastes.","June 21, 2015","true","7.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But i like the first game alot more because of its very memorable level design. I just prefer the levels of doom 1 over doom 2.  Doom 2 has a lot of levels where you get stuck at and takes forever to find out where to go next which breaks the flow of the shooting. The original also had these moments from time to time but it happens alot more here because the levels are more open then the original and they feel like mazes. I wasn't very fond of some of the new enemies they added as well. Gameplay is identical to the original they just added the super shotgun which is one of the greatest weapons in gaming history.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gatechgrad/recommended/2300/","gatechgrad","GaTechGrad","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gatechgrad/","593 products in account","DOOM II was the first DOOM game I played back when I was a teenager.  Back in those days, I spent hours trying to free enough base memory (DOS only gave you 640K) to play games like this.  After getting it running, the frame rate was really choppy and only playable in a reduced size window.  I remember seeing it on a 486 and being wow-ed seeing it run at full screen.  I also remember the first time seeing a chainsaw used as a weapon, which was really unheard of back in those days (Mortal Kombat had not hit the arcades yet).\nSo how does DOOM II hold up after all these years?  I will admit, when I started it up, it looked down right ugly running at full screen.  No joystick compatibility was a bummer as well.  I seem to remember my Gravis gamepad working on the original DOOM II back in the day, which I bought a Creative Labs Sound Blaster card specifically for the joystick port.  The level design seems to hold up well, and I still remembered many of the secret rooms.  I actually jumped a little when an imp popped out behind a hidden door, which I had forgotten about after all of these years.\nTo be honest, I had more fun playing this classic than playing any of the current FPS games.  You press enter, pick a difficulty, and you are playing.  In games these days, you have to sit through minutes and minutes of boring dialogue and cutscenes before you can do anything.  That why I always try to put players in the action as soon as possible in the games that I develop.","November 28, 2015","true","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Play as DOOM guy as he pushes the demon threat back from his base of operations onto Planet Earth, where he seeks to finally put an end to the chaos.\n\nGameplay: Bob and weave with the new super shotgun weapon, your most used weapon in the game most likely. The pistol, regular shotgun, rocket launcher, plasma rifle, chaingun, BFG are also great options. Health still doesn't regenerate, but of course there are pickups you run over. More puzzles, switches, portals, new enemy types such as the Arch-Vile await. 30 main levels to go through.\n\nSound: Crisp booms for explosions and ending animations.\n\nGraphics: They still hold up with a source port. The final level is a spectacle to behold.\n\nTechnical: No framerate issues or crashes. Glitches can occur if you look in areas you're not supposed to be with the skybox, but it's not a big deal. Make sure to use a source port like Zandronum.\n\nFinal Verdict: Out of all the DOOM games, this one is the most enjoyable and easy to replay. If you have the money, buy it however you can (note you can get this game DRM free on GoG). Necessary for your gaming library and understanding of how the FPS genre has changed since 1994. Try to look for the DOOM bundle sale when possible.","January 7","true","26.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

After revisiting the game, I've changed my opinion about it, probably because of knowing the control scheme this time, and getting a different computer.\n\nBefore, I commented on the controls being a bit... iffy. While this time, I got used to it, it's still a bit disorienting, as you might be used to controlling FPS games with WASD. But with DOOM 2, there's two ways to control, using WASD and the mouse, with moving the mouse up and down moving the character back and forth, possibly moving you in the way of a bullet, or off a ledge. You'd have to get used to the mouse controls, and you'll most likely only use the keyboard to switch weapons. I personally didn't see this as a problem with my re-visit.\n\nI loved the game this time around, maybe because there wasn't a loud sound glitch after the first level, or most likely because the computer I switched to is more optimized for DOOM 2.\n\nTo everyone who read this review before I changed it, I'm sorry for giving it a harsh review at first.","June 30, 2015","true","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","17"

Buy it already. You run at 40 mph while blasting dozens of monsters from Hell in tight corridors and broad arenas. It's fun.\n\nDON'T play it through Steam, however. Look up Skulltag and learn how to set it up. Purchase the Steam edition only for the doom2.wad file you need to run Skulltag. With Skulltag, you get better graphics, more options, a good platform for running custom levels, and support for a myriad of features not available in the DOS version (like jumping, swimming, and crosshair aim which some mods use). GZDoom is an another choice, but Skulltag is mostly an improved version of GZDoom from what I can tell.","May 16","true","1.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sharuun/recommended/2300/","sharuun","No More Please","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sharuun/","205 products in account","This is probably the first time I've ever seen a game sequel be just as competent as it's predecessor, without really raising or lowering the bar.\n\nI like DOOM. I like it a lot. And with all the hype behind the new DOOM 2016, I just couldn't help myself but throw some more hours into beating its sequel: Hell on Earth.\n\nBecause DOOM 2016 would beat my poor little laptop to death.\n\nDOOM II takes place right after DOOM I, where Doomguy gets back from Mars to see earth covered with demons, and decides to take care of the problem the same way he did previously- by killing every demon that stands in his way. Like Carmack said, the story in games aren't important. While I may disagree with that statement, I do agree that an action-based should focus more on keeping you in the action as much as it can. And DOOM I and II both succeed in that, in my opinion.\n\nWith making a sequel, there's often the question of what will be added on to the new entry. With DOOM II there is a wide variety of new levels that are much more intuitively-designed than the first game, along with a new onslaught of enemies to face, including one of my least favorite enemies ever: The Pain Elementals. F*** those guys. Seriously. F*** those guys.\n\nSurprisingly, as far as new content goes, besides the new enemies and levels, all you're given for new weapons is the super shotgun, which quickly became my favorite weapon. It uses two shotgun shells per round, and does extra damage as opposed to the standard shotgun. The game is challenging with all this new stuff, and I found myself in the DOOM-daze, where all I can think about over the week is playing more DOOM and getting more and more sucked in with every playthrough.\n\nThis is a very addicting game, but one flaw I saw throughout it (besides the lack of story) would be how the game really feels like an expansion to the original DOOM. It may have the run-time of a full game, but the textures, mixtures of old enemies with the new ones, and same arsenal as the first game, makes the game feel like more of DOOM I. I personally believe a game should accel from the foundation of the first game, but whether you disagree or agree with me is entirely your choice.\n\nI won't deny that I love this game still. Just as much as the first DOOM. It's fast-paced, looks great, sounds great, and is addicting from start to finish. But since a lot of it does feel like the first game just bleeding into a sequel, I'm giving it the exact same score I'd give DOOM. A 7/10.","May 27","true","6.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
