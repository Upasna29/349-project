And it definitely has a certain Tron vibe, only instead of Jeff Bridges, the protagonist is a bored, incapacitated old man.  Compelling!\n\nAm I glad I bought it?  Yes, because now I don't have to wonder if I was missing out on something great.  So IS Tank Universal great?  No.  Is it worth your time as a die-hard Tron fan?  Possibly.  And if you've never seen Tron?  Less, um... possibly.\n\nAsk yourself:\n"Do I enjoy Tron-inspired games where the primary mechanic is mentally calculating how to hit moving targets from a moving vehicle on sloped sufaces with a relatively slow-moving projectile that is affected by gravity (even though the existance of gravity in a digital world makes no sense)?"\nIf the answer is "yes" and you have $5 to spare, buy Tank Universal.\n\nBut also ask yourself:\n"Am I deeply annoyed by incoherent/irrelevant storylines, especially when I'm forced to endure them in lengthy, unskippable cinematics?"\n"Do my eyes roll back into my head during tedious, unnecessary travel sequences through static environments with no interaction?"\n"Do I have a hard time letting go of my nagging sensation that a game, for some unknown reason, isn't as good as it could have been?"\n"Did I hate Tron?"\nIf the answer is "yes" to any of these, consider passing over Tank Universal.  Maybe the tank moved a little too slugishly, or maybe the upgrading & leveling system lacked the right incentives or rewards.  I could never figure it out.  The game always felt like off-brand Legos: that kind that fit together, though not quite right, and never with that secure, satisfying "click" of precision.  Don't get me wrong, it's still fun, but why didn't Grandma just buy EXACTLY what I WROTE on my *** **** LIST!?!?\n\nSorry, I'm thinking of my 9th birthday.  What were we talking about again?","January 6, 2014","true","0.3"," 101 of 116 people (87%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","87","101","116","4","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheSadTruth/recommended/19200/","TheSadTruth","QETC™Crimson","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheSadTruth/","4156 products in account","At first glance, the appeal of this game comes from the contrasting colors of its tron inspired graphic style, although it is not a graphically intensive game. The graphic style works well given the story of the game and some tidbits like animations for dying, respawning, and starting a level. Something that was bugging me about the game, however, is that after doing some searching online the developers of the game stated that the game was locked at 30 fps. I'm not playing on a potato here. The sound is appropriate to the visual style of the game and changes to accent certain in game events, but it can get repetitive.\n\nAs for the gameplay of this game, you wander around some twenty odd levels as either a tank or a soldier on foot. As a foot soldier you don’t have weapons and can only run around and use a shield and its gameplay consists of either exploring around structures that are too cramped for a tank or running across a battlefield and using your shield to protect you. As a tank, you go around the map completing objectives such as traveling to advance the story, escorting units, or base defense/offense where you have to build up your base and capture the enemy key/flag while keeping your own safe. During the base missions, you don’t have to micro manage units or building anything, all you usually need to do is bring a resource to the base to make it begin construction and mark resources for harvesting and the computer will automatically build things. You also have only one primary weapon, the tank’s cannon which can be charged for more area of effect and damage, but charge resets if you are damaged. You also need to collect shards from killed enemies to use powerups such as sprinting or firing rockets or summoning units. Once you have enough shards you can use any power that you have unlocked according to its cost. To unlock these power ups and upgrade them, certain tasks will give you points to upgrade them as will finishing levels and you have to go to an upgrade station as a tank. Some power ups can be used with only a few shards and others are very powerful, but you need to save the shards; but I personally preferred to use them on sprinting most of the time.\n\nMany of the levels give you the idea that the world is huge and as such, you are incredibly slow without sprinting, but your sprinting is limited by these shards which only drop upon killing enemies. This problem is compounded by the game’s respawn locations and lack of a save system. If you die on some levels, you could be ages away from the next objective, but at least you will respawn with some shards to spring back, if only for a little while. As for the lack of a save system, you must complete a level in full or your progress will not be saved, so make sure that if you play this game that you can commit some time into finishing a level or just idle on it. If it weren’t for the slow pace of the game compounded with sometimes terrible respawning locations, the game would be more enjoyable, but it is still worth playing it to play something that is a different genre.","May 23, 2015","false","10.0"," 16 of 20 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","16","20","2","0"

Very fun game & very unique in some aspects, the game gives off a neat Tron like feel, if Tron was a complete warzone anyway.\n\nStory wise Tank Universal delivers, I'm only a few hours into the main story but it's pretty fun, the only dissapointment is that they set it up that you're some old guy using a simulation helmet.. ruins a bit of immersion, but oh well! The actual story is pretty fun to play but so far I've realised there's a lot of empty parts of the game where you're just driving endlessly to get to your next objective which can be a bit drab.\n\nWhen you're actually in a battle though the game is very exciting to play, alongside a ranking up system with Steam achievements to match your rank the game can make it feel rewarding to excel in combat.\n\nOverall? Great game but the level design needs to be worked on, and there's a lack of a proper skirmish mode (Maybe you unlock it when you complete the game?) -Also the music they have in the game.. perfect, well suited to it's theme. 8/10\n\nI would love to see these developers have a kickstarter to make a much more advanced version of the game too.","July 9, 2014","true","2.3"," 22 of 32 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","22","32","0","0"

Tank Universal sticks to just the tank battles rather than all the different gaming styles it's obvious inspiration, the movie TRON, taught us about. This indie developer hit the mark with a sweet blend of tank simulation that is fun to play. It really feels like you are another human wandering the computer plains in a parallel story to the original TRON movie.\n\nThe game only has one real weakness, it wasn't an officially licenses TRON game. Because of this it doesn't have the strongest story line in terms of dialog and has to makes up for it in presentation. It does this in spades however and can keep you engrossed as you truly feel like you are alive in the original TRON world. Most of the time, in game, I felt as though a greater story line could have come about if only the author wasn't skirting copyright. There is an epic sense of why you are playing that feels like it needs stated outright. This is obvious, for those of us who have seen the original TRON. Without being able to state the complete and rather epic story that is hidden within Tank Universals premise, the story comes off shallow and lacking. It feels like we missed the main plot line of something truly epic. Despite this flaw, the game is incredibly fun.\n\nThis game is great in what it does, it does WELL! The tank battles are fun, and can be quite challenging! The battlefield is a living environment and there are some decent physics at play. There is even a small amount of strategy in how you attack directly affects the results of battles. Watch as the enemy rebuilds his fortress if you slack off on the attack; beware indirect fire, and call in a Titan to literally tear down your enemies walls.\n\nI only wish that Tank Universal had been a licensed TRON game as this is what the first 3D TRON game should have been. The licensed official game should have been the sequel to this one! All fans of the movie and or tank battles should try this game out!\n\nTanks / Simulator combat / indie / simple strategy / retro style","October 26, 2014","true","7.5"," 13 of 17 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","13","17","0","0"

The only thing missing are the discs and the clank-clank as you walk around (which Tron 2.0 got so so right for me)..\n\nSo, what is Tank Universal? Well, it's a Tron-homage-labour-of-love.  It's clearly an indie game.  The lack of voice-overs, and very simplistic animation marks it out as a small-team (one man?) effort.  Also, the story is very similar to Tron (Bad Guy taking over the system, User logs in to kick ♥♥♥, and all other programs are amazed at how the User has more skills and powers)...\n\nTank Universal packs so much in. There's a little bit of wandering-around on foot, and a lot of time spent in a tank.  While in the tank, you can traverse mazes, explore the beautiful world they created, play domination, and so on. Everything under the 'umbrella' of being a good dude fighting in a world of bad dudes, and needing to travel around it to stay ahead of the 'bad dudes', while getting closer to the 'big bad dude' for the final fight... There's really quite a lot of variety, and stuff isn't repeated to death, like they would be in a AAA game, where they have to milk every last cent out of an expensive asset (for example).\n\nI was impressed by pretty much everything in this game.  The ship/tank models are lush.  The world design is stunning. The sounds/music are very very close to Tron, and the visuals are 100% spot-on (They even replicate the irregular 'flashing' of the poor rotoscoping in the movie by pulsing the brightness.. So ingenous..)..\n\nIs there anything which makes me unhappy?  That the game ended.   Playing domination was great fun (I was playing in easy mode, which may explain it).\n\nSo, if you love Tron, and want to play a tron-like classic good vs. evil game, and aren't too hung up over spoken voiceovers, or FMV, then this game is for you!.\n\nHighly Recommended\n","July 1, 2015","true","10.0"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

There was some sort of story line to the game, but it was very strange, but not nearly as hard to follow as Eye: Divine Cybermancy. The tank was not too hard to learn to control, the only thing that took a bit of work for me was aiming the arc of the cannon at high speed long distance battle. Much of the game has you doing roughly the same thing over and over again, with more elements added on though. Capture the flag, but as the game goes on the "flag" gets harder and harder to get to. But there are a few times you have to get out of your tank to do things, like try to hold on for dear life as you ride a virtual goat or something!

Developed by a single person, New Zealand's graphic designer Phil Jones, the game kicks off by introducing you to a terminally ill patient who was prescribed a virtual reality headset in order to help him relax. Inside this virtual reality is where you will take control of Unit8, a soldier finding himself at the beginning of a revolution against the society that rules the virtual world, deciding to join the resistance and help them defeat Gorgon, the ruler and oppressor of their world. From that point onwards, the game will send you on different snatch and grab missions combined with the occasional open combat against Gorgon's forces, which does get repetitive after a while, even though each chapter has its unique twist. Even though the premise is kind of weird and intriguing in its own way, this first chapter of who knows how many has nothing new to offer, as we've seen numerous dictators vs resistance stories before, and this one has nothing new to offer. There are only a few characters defined with names, such as the commander of the resistance whose orders you will follow, but there is nothing that will make you attached to his story or the cause you're fighting for, making the entire story feel pointless and boring nonetheless as you will spend most of your time moving from point A to point B without any given purpose.\nRating: 5.5\n\nGameplay\nEven though there are some on-foot sections those are strictly implemented for the sake of the story, leaving the rest of the action to be experienced from inside your tank, the instrument of the only gameplay mechanics you'll get to play with. Aside from simple movements you will have nine different abilities for your tank, ranging from speed boosts to healing and even a nuclear bomb later on in the game. Using each one of those abilities requires shards, which you can acquire by destroying enemy tanks, making it vital to collect each shard if you want to head into the next battle prepared. While the first abilities you'll earn will also be the ones you'll use the most even by the end of the game, as using speed boost in order to dodge enemy fire is key, the ones unlocked later on will probably be a one time use only, as things such as mines or smoke bombs are less efficient and use shards that can otherwise be used on the traditional, yet efficient weapons. The objectives you'll aim for will quickly become dull as well, even though the game somehow combines them in chapters in order to hide that, but in a slow moving tank across a battlefield filled with objectives such as destroy thing A or reach point B, it's hard to have fun when you're constantly doing the same thing in the same way you did before; there is simply nothing new worth unlocking as you progress to the game, as you will see everything good there is in the first hour and be disappointed afterwards as you notice that's all there is.\nRating: 6\n\nGraphics\nThe sad truth about Tank Universal is that it looks outdated and ugly; sure, the game wants to look retro, but low resolution textures, limited colors and ugly visual effects are things that cling more to outdated than retro. On top of that, even considering the Tron-like look of the game, the environments look roughly the same, rarely changing colors or a few objects here and there to differentiate levels.\nRating: 3.5\n\nAudio\nThe tehno beats go in theme with the overall look of the game, but everything else from repetitive and low quality effects to annoying explosion sounds and the lack of dialogue makes the audio part of Tank Universal something you could easily live without, as the sound effects will rapidly get annoying and repetitive.\nRating: 4.5\n\nExtras\nIt takes around eight hours to finish Tank Universal, and even if there is a multiplayer mode, I couldn't recommend that as it lacks modes and barely works properly at all, and even when it does it still gets boring after 10 minutes. You could try to replay some of the chapters in order to achieve the highest level and earn all achievements, but even with all that you can only squeeze a few more hours.\nRating: 7\n\nVerdict\nTank Universal is quite impressive considering the fact that it's all been done by one single person, but leaving his congratulations aside, this is still a pretty bad game, as the story is barely an introduction to what may possibly happen in a future sequel and the gameplay becomes boring quickly enough, not to mention the outdated graphics and sound design.\nRating Overall: 5.3\n\nCheck out the full review and a lot more about Tank Universal at http://gamedragons.net/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=362[/url[/b][/h1]","August 23, 2015","true","26.5"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

The objectives you'll aim for will quickly become dull as well, even though the game somehow combines them in chapters in order to hide that, but in a slow moving tank across a battlefield filled with objectives such as destroy thing A or reach point B, it's hard to have fun when you're constantly doing the same thing in the same way you did before; there is simply nothing new worth unlocking as you progress to the game, as you will see everything good there is in the first hour and be disappointed afterwards as you notice that's all there is.\nRating: 6\n\nGraphics\nThe sad truth about Tank Universal is that it looks outdated and ugly; sure, the game wants to look retro, but low resolution textures, limited colors and ugly visual effects are things that cling more to outdated than retro. On top of that, even considering the Tron-like look of the game, the environments look roughly the same, rarely changing colors or a few objects here and there to differentiate levels.\nRating: 3.5\n\nAudio\nThe tehno beats go in theme with the overall look of the game, but everything else from repetitive and low quality effects to annoying explosion sounds and the lack of dialogue makes the audio part of Tank Universal something you could easily live without, as the sound effects will rapidly get annoying and repetitive.\nRating: 4.5\n\nExtras\nIt takes around eight hours to finish Tank Universal, and even if there is a multiplayer mode, I couldn't recommend that as it lacks modes and barely works properly at all, and even when it does it still gets boring after 10 minutes. You could try to replay some of the chapters in order to achieve the highest level and earn all achievements, but even with all that you can only squeeze a few more hours.\nRating: 7\n\nVerdict\nTank Universal is quite impressive considering the fact that it's all been done by one single person, but leaving his congratulations aside, this is still a pretty bad game, as the story is barely an introduction to what may possibly happen in a future sequel and the gameplay becomes boring quickly enough, not to mention the outdated graphics and sound design.\nRating Overall: 5.3\n\nCheck out the full review and a lot more about Tank Universal at http://gamedragons.net/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=362[/url[/b][/h1]","August 23, 2015","true","26.5"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

The music is good and you can just lose yourself in it and destroy entire tank regiments like a boss. The difficulty curve is reasonable, though it could stand to be harder.

The controls are pretty fluid, though the tutorial level could stand to be expanded upon in sequels. It could also stand to be longer as I am almost completed the game and its barely been 6 hours (which for an Indie game is impressive, but should be longer in the future). The large levels are nice, and the cyberpunk style works well with the music and the setting.

It may not be the most graphically advanced game, but the gameplay is fantastic.\n\nEvery level brought something new, it didn't feel repeditive at all, and on normal difficulty it offered a good challange, so going straight to hard difficulty is not required. If I had to list a con in the game it would probably be the cut scenes, as they were a little dragged out.\n\nBasically, I would say that if you can get this game on a discount buy it.

First it is an indi game. Nicely done low budget game. You can see at the attempt of making a nice story. It is really text lines with some of the a little crudely made characters. But what you expect from a cheap game like that. In the 80s there was a movie called Tron. It was about a person just somehow got teleported to a computer world that looked very sciencefiction like. Strange energy neon like lightings, walls and floors. It was original back than.\n\nIn the 90s a nice game called Tron 2.0 was developed. I must have played that game till the disk broke. It was with fast lightcycles and first person shooter like combat. It only lacked the famous tank combat from the original movie. This game was bringing back some good memories of that game. The primitive yet somehow future style computer generated music.\n\nIt is nice to have in my game collection as I am a huge Tron fan. The lighting in the game is really Tron like. The tank combat it is just plain simple and good. I love the look of this game and for the price of a few pennies it is just  something I had to have. I can't complain or say I regret it.

The tank fighting is fun and ascends to being unique in particular areas, but I wouldn't say it's anything special (and for the game's price, why should it be?).\n\nThe game's visual actually work towards the game's advantage too, effectively selling virtual reality world you're placed in and sometimes tasked with exploring from the beginning.\n\nIt's not all just tank battle either.

The player goes up against a giant eyeball overlord along with men from a resistance movement. Together they fight past vast amounts of enemy vehicles such as tanks, artillery, and even ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ bombers.\nThe story is more or less just there so people won't complain about lack of a story, and the read-only dialogue is laughably bad at times, but the game contains a lot of fun to be had and some really unexpected twists.\nOnce you beat the campaign, you can test your strength in the "skirmish" mode, where you have 20 minutes to kill as many enemies, of all types, as possible, and try not to die in the process.\n\nHowever, there are a few downsides to this game:\nno multiplayer whatsoever\ncapped at 30fps\nyou don't have a reliable way to deal with swarms of enemies\nThis game is one of a two-part series, and there is a Tank Universal 2 in the works. Hopefully we see some modernization in it, I would absolutely love to skirmish with real players.\n\nOverall, I really like this game, and definately recommend it, but know that replayability is extremely limited and there is no multiplayer.\n56/64 bits","July 12, 2014","true","9.0"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","54","7","13","0","0"

I was always tempted by the beautifully rendered TRON-style visuals and the simplicity of the art direction about the game.\n\nAfter finally having it sit there and stare at me, I decided to buy it and give it a shot. Man, what a suprirse this game turned out to be. The in-tank gameplay is excellent and quite difficult. You'll find yourself learning to place and gauge shot distances almost instantly, though you may be outclassed by the AI in this regard. The levels are large, and somewhat sparse of detail but it fits the feel of the TRON Visual style.\n\nSound design is excellent, though there are no voice-overs for any of the characters. Even pulling a gibberish-langauge Voice Over like E.Y.E would have been acceptable, but the demands on a one-man dev team mandated this cut.\n\nThere are a few on-foot sections that feel rather out of place as you can't jump, crouch, nor engage in any combat. You simply can run from place to place.","October 5, 2011","true","6.6"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

First off, when you start the game the controls just feel floaty and bad. Theres no view bobble or anything it kind of feels like your on a segway. The mouse sensitivity is way to high, if you move your mouse at all you are basically doing a 360. Turning mouse sensitivy down also does'nt work, you still turn like speedy gonazales.\nGraphics: My god. you can tell all of the work went towards the tanks and battles. The walls have no texture, no joke some walls were just black voids. The "human" are an absolute abomination. Polygons are jutting out of them, you could cut a ♥♥♥♥♥ by walking to her. Once you finnaly get into a tank. (about 30-40) minutes in it's not that bad. The begining is god aweful though.\nTank Battles: Oh my god. They nailed it. Being in a tank and trying to dodge and weave while trying to line up a shot is really fun.You can also charge up your shots by holding the fire button. Also there is 9 other gadgets in the game. I only got to play with the turbo. (which is nuts, you fly with that on.) And the other was a shield recovery. I can only imagine the other will add a pretty decent amount of depth in the game. You can also upgrade your tank with crystals dropped from destroyed enemy tanks. This part was the focus of the game obviously and they did a great job, it's fun challenging and rewarding.\nFinal Score: 7/10 ( only because of tank battles.

If you have 5 bucks to blow, and like neon splashed shooting games, it's totally worth it.\n\nThe "Meh:"\n\nThe game is relatively short. Once I finished, I was left wanting more levels and more challenges.\nThere's really not a whole lot of change - it's like an fps in a sense. Simple: point and shoot. Kill the enemy.\nThe storyline isn't particularly deep, and it's a bit hard to follow.\nI wish there was more you could do while on foot. Perhaps weapons, on foot levels, comandeering different vehicles.\n\nThe Good:\nThe visuals might not be Battlefield 4 on a PS4 quality, but they're still straight eye candy.\nThere's a lot of thought and effort put into level design. The levels are sprawling and engaging.\nCombat progresses from pretty easy to (possibly) infuriating. There's certainly no lack of difficulty in the later levels.\nYou are forced to think strategically; reload speed, position, and cover all become major factors.\nThe battles take place on a mass scale. Artillery, towers, turrets, bombers, mechs, enemy tanks, it's all there.\nFantastic waste of time! The gameplay isn't careless, but it isn't serious enough to frustrate me or regret playing.\n\nEveryone has said it. If you like TRON and the old school arcade games like Battlezone, you'll probably feel right at home here. I certainly recommend trying the demo before buying. If you like the demo and have 5 bucks to blow, it's definitely an investment you won't regret.\n\n\n","January 29, 2015","true","17.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It depicts the tank parts from the classic Tron movie very well.

The music is great and kicks in a beat when the action revs up...\n\nVisually you can choose any resoluiton, which isnt default when it comes to Indie games yet, you have a few other graphical settings like vsync and "glow" effect,but its enough to pull of the "Tron look". I just recommend turning off the grain effect.\n\nThe game plays you both inside and outside the tank. Outside is mostly for story where you walk around and talk to people etc and inside is where most of the action is.

If you have 5 bucks to blow, and like neon splashed shooting games, it's totally worth it.\n\nThe "Meh:"\n\nThe game is relatively short. Once I finished, I was left wanting more levels and more challenges.\nThere's really not a whole lot of change - it's like an fps in a sense. Simple: point and shoot. Kill the enemy.\nThe storyline isn't particularly deep, and it's a bit hard to follow.\nI wish there was more you could do while on foot. Perhaps weapons, on foot levels, comandeering different vehicles.\n\nThe Good:\nThe visuals might not be Battlefield 4 on a PS4 quality, but they're still straight eye candy.\nThere's a lot of thought and effort put into level design. The levels are sprawling and engaging.\nCombat progresses from pretty easy to (possibly) infuriating. There's certainly no lack of difficulty in the later levels.\nYou are forced to think strategically; reload speed, position, and cover all become major factors.\nThe battles take place on a mass scale. Artillery, towers, turrets, bombers, mechs, enemy tanks, it's all there.\nFantastic waste of time! The gameplay isn't careless, but it isn't serious enough to frustrate me or regret playing.\n\nEveryone has said it. If you like TRON and the old school arcade games like Battlezone, you'll probably feel right at home here. I certainly recommend trying the demo before buying. If you like the demo and have 5 bucks to blow, it's definitely an investment you won't regret.\n\n\n","January 29, 2015","true","17.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

My birthday, my cousin is over and were on my families brand new E-machines windows ME edition. He loads up a website full of java games, and one of them put you in charge of a Tron-tank in a green Tron-like world full of red tanks. That game was fun, and ever since then I have had an afinity with being a tank driver (That was all I did in BF2). I saw this game and thought back to that birthday. Pretty solid tank game all in all. Very good story, borrowed A LOT of elements from Tron but still to good effect in this universe. The game has a rocking battle system, designed like a DOTA type game (think Leage of Legends). Had their been a way to buy different tanks and play on different maps besides campaign levels, and of course a multiplayer component, their really is not anything that would have kept me from recommending this game to just about anyone. But, it has none of those features. I still got a lot of enjoyment from this game (suprislingly), I don't regret picking it up.","November 16, 2011","true","9.3"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

When I got around to playing the full game, I found that they took the whole Tron thing and ran with it, making about as blatant a rip-off as rip-offs go. From the plot to the obvious copy of the MCP, very little is original about this game. The walking portions are also pretty bad and only highlight the low budgetness of the game with poor animations and textures, and nothing you do while walking is very fun at all. It also proclaims to be part one of two games, and as far as I'm aware no Tank Universal 2 exists, so if you can somehow get into the story, you'll probably be left wanting.\n\nAll that aside though, the tank combat is serviceable, though I feel it really would benefit from online multiplayer. It would be a great stretch to call this a good game, as it seems to focus on the worst parts of itself, but if you can get it for cheap (I think I've seen 90% off coupons for it) and really dig tanks and Tron, it's probably worth a lark.","February 1, 2014","true","1.2"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

The missions you do in this singeplayer tank game are really fun and large; this is the perfect game for multiplayer but sadly it isn't :I\n\nI got about 8 hours worth of this when i played it ages ago but whenever i see Tron/ Tron inspired things it makes me want to play it again.\n\nAll the combat you do is done within your tank as you help the rebels destroy the evil "overlord" (like in Tron :P) by capturing the enemies core and taking back to your base or by destroying their base (Depending on the mission). You fight and flight alongside other tanks as well as a variety of space ships, artillery and base defences.\n\n\nThe gameplay is awesome, the graphics and sound are classic and can never get old and the story is intriguing and makes you want to keep on fighting and help the rebels win the war. I love this game and the only thing that could make it better is if it had multiplayer.","March 14, 2011","true","9.0"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

The tank movements are really unresponsive and hard to control, let alone dodge incoming enemy fire. Shooting is also really bad, since there's a huge delay between shots, so you spend half of the time just walking around. Because of those reasons you end up dying a couple of times, and the worst thing happens. You get to a lift, call it,have to stay in the same position (if you move you have to call it again), and wait a couple of minutes to be on the battlefield again.\n\nI would never pay the full price for this. Hell, I don't want this not even for free.","November 26, 2015","false","0.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"
