I can not speak for any of the other languages, but the English translation for Snow Light is embarassing. Not only does the vast majority of the script read like it was run through Google Translate without revision, it has enough typos to clearly indicate the writer/translator did not even bother to use spell check.\n\nThe terrible writing is not the only thing that muddles this story. The game uses so many acronyms that it can be difficult to keep track of them all. Some exist in the real world, some are made up for the game, but they all run together to combine with the incoherent translation in making the story extremely hard to follow.\n\nThe art ranges from appearing decent to looking like something a teenager threw together in Microsoft Paint. In some cases you can tell the artist reused a face asset which makes a character look like a mishapen freak of nature with two mouths.\n\nThe text is not always accompanied by sound. During my playthrough there were a number of long durations of text exposition that occurred in either total silence or with just some ambient white noise. The game has no voice acting, and most of the game sounds are just cheesy stock-sounding gunfire noises.\n\nThe interactive aspect consists of approximately ten quick time events that appear without warning and involves seemingly random keypresses. You never know when to expect them, what key you will have to press (either once or quickly in repetition), and they have a very short input window. When you fail the game goes back around 5 seconds for you to do it again once you know to expect it. Luckily you only lose those few seconds each time, since you will most likely fail them all at first (they also pop up at the top of the screen while you are reading the dialogue at the bottom). There are also two branching options that the player can choose from, but they appear to only affect a specific scene each and does not have any affect on the larger narrative.\n\nThe narrative itself, as difficult as it is to follow, ends as if this is the first chapter in an episodic game.  I don't know if this is the developer's plan, but even if it is, do not expect much satisfaction from the story. There are much better visual novels available on Steam. I suggest you exhaust as many other options as possible before purchasing this.","November 2, 2014","false","1.6"," 241 of 248 people (97%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","97","241","248","9","7"

(Maybe it reads better in French or one of the other languages, but I somehow doubt the story is saner.)\n\n- As a visual novel, the game is a debacle. The story is an atrocious mess of jargon which is apparently a side-story to the creator's epic "Dragon and Weed" (This is not a joke, it explains this in a heavily abridged form in a submenu you can find) saga that you can bet your ♥♥♥♥ I'm never going to look up. There are maybe 4 "branch points" in the game. They do nothing. Save and click either option! Nothing changes at all. As a result, you're just here to watch whatever strange superpowered wankfest this is play out over a few hours, with the occasional break in the form of...\n- Quick-Time Events. No, seriously. Keep your hand on the keyboard and make sure you're familiar with french keyboard layouts, because that's what the keys are bound around. Earlier in the game there are more of these and then they just stop, like even the developer realized how dumb they were and didn't care enough to remove them. At least one failed to register for me until I restarted the game, so don't go in expecting them to be tightly-coded, either.\n- The game says it runs in some sort of custom 3D engine! Probably to allow for the QTEs. It's not very good and somehow it crashed twice on me in the process of playing. A visual novel with no branch points crashed on me. Just take in how much of a wreck it is that this is a thing I'm writing. It wasn't a hard thing to test, fella.\n- I don't speak the other languages to compare, but the English script is a debacle. Characters will repeat the same line back at each other randomly, some phrases are just entirely garbage (my favorite line in the game: "It's seems that Menkens hathwart someone he shouldn't. Men of the Bad Santass are here and not to joke..."), and more than a few lines just stopped a word in and continued on like the script wasn't matching up with timing somehow. Others were just still in French for no reason. Unlike a lot of VNs, there's no rewind function, so I hope you like being left in the dark or restarting entire chapters to figure out what the hell is going on. It's not going to help.\n- The art is terrible. Action scenes don't feel kinetic, they feel like someone on Deviantart just learned Photoshop has filters. One of the climactic moments of the story has a man take off his shirt and then suddenly the screen is a mess of glowing red chains, because "he used to tame the tigers". It then cuts to black and suddenly he's beat up a little.\n- I hope you don't want a soundtrack, because the only accompaniment the game has are some three-note "baby's first music" compositions, a lot of generic stock sound effects like gunfire or explosions, and most of the game is silent. Entirely silent.\n- I guess the obscene price on here is part of some kind of weird scam by the creator to get you to buy it from him elsewhere directly rather than give Steam a cut. (I got a review key.) It's not worth buying, so take neither route. This thing is a trainwreck, and in that sad "400 passengers dead" style rather than the "oh man it's so bad it's good" fashion.\n\nIn no way should you ever give this game the dignity of a thought, much less devote yourself to playing it.","August 14, 2015","false","2.4"," 118 of 121 people (98%) found this review helpful 27 people found this review funny","98","118","121","27","3"

Not because the story is bad, it starts out pretty good to be honest. But, there're just some serious grammar failures and some serious artwork errors.\nI'll write a more complete review later, but at this moment I can't get myself to reading more of it and as such I do NOT recommend it at this moment.\n\nAlright, I booted the game again. (Almost a year later) and although the developers said that they would fix the translation problem.., it's still a brutal mess. Most of the time I'm just so frustrated by trying to fix the mess I read on screen, it makes me feel like I'm taking somekind of grammar test; "Detect the 15  failures in the small block of text." That's how bad it is. This shouldn't even be released on Steam.","November 8, 2014","false","0.2"," 53 of 67 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","53","67","0","0"

This led me to be depression, and I feel I'm too smarter for peple to understand. A goal that I thought would be playing video games until I am too dumber and then I would be happier. I feel tat I would better suit my friends then. It was a good plan. And then I'll be happier.\n\nSo I play Snow Light. Snow Light is a game about the future where many wars and battles and wars occur between the many letters of factions, suh as UNECA, SAUN, AJNA, ASIS, DAAP, CAAP, ETC, etc. I do not know what all these letters mean because they mix everything together after a while, but please do not confuse them, because it is important for the stry to make sense. The name of Snow Light is not Snow Liht. Not her first or her last name. It is Catherine Anna Delbtos Da Verrone. She is shoot bullet faster than the speed of light, so her code name. And is light boots. But it is also caled Katy. The game is mainly about her puruit of White Maks, which typos very often in his talks, like spelling whenm and hae. I think about who is White Mask, you might find other people who typos lot, and it would suspicioun.\n\nTo do this, Snow Light trvels to far away places in the world, and QTEs many many many people. My favorite was the Favalas Tiger Man. And Menkens. You also get to play naked Rebecca in two points. She has sexy, but I still like Snow Light beter. And there is fat man. You are going to South America, which is not in USE, and Russias, and England, and other locaions. I will not spoilers but ahahah, there are many spies and doble cros and names named Lisa ahahah.\n\nGraphic are good, especialy during the battle scenes where whole screen shakes, 1080p. And there is a helicoptor. There are a few bugs, which plays in cineatic talks before it happens, but it gets you used to ignore half of what is said in any case, it is not too bad. QTEs are in Visual Novel, and you may be asking WHY, but it is important for the high scoe. It adds replays. Can you make 0 QTE fails? Play again and again.\n\nAll in all, I would say my test was success. My IQ now is 82. So I am much less intellident. I fit in with friends lots better, ahahah. Somteimes they look at me weird because I have hard time forming complete and understanding sentnces, but I am much happier because I played Snow Light. You play Snow Light too. You be happier.\n\nRemember: Do it quickly and use synchronisation.\n\n>tfw Dragon and Weed will never be grenlit ;_;","June 21, 2015","true","6.6"," 89 of 267 people (33%) found this review helpful 229 people found this review funny","33","89","267","229","27"

This is more like playing a graphic novel with sub-titles that you have to read. This has decisions that you have to make that could affect the game play. Once I got used to the style of the game it isn 't that bad. The game is not for everyone. The game can use more attention. Yes I do recomend this game because it is not a common game where everything is fast moving like a RPG or FPS.","January 2, 2015","true","0.4"," 9 of 175 people (5%) found this review helpful 23 people found this review funny","5","9","175","23","8"
