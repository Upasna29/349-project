View this as a tentative YES, leaning heavily towards NO for the state it's in right now. This game needs work. A lot of work. Also- some of the positive reviews are really fishy. First-time reviewers who are overly enthusiastic about a game they have .1 hours in. It reeks of friends + family reviews. One of them even has 'MUMMY' in their name. Review continues below:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrVYc8kMVY\n\nThe concept here is fantastic. It's sort of a blend of 'Battleblock Theater' and 'Mighty Quest For Epic Loot'. Build your 'pyramid' using blocks, traps, etc- to try to prevent other players from making it to the end and stealing your treasure. Similarly, of course- you try to defeat other players'.\n\nThere is a cash shop. I'm holding off judgement on that for now, to see how necessary it seems... but for now, just know that there are seemingly only a small handful of items you can use in your Pyramid without having currency. It's DEFINITELY early access. There are some big issues. I can't get my xbox one controller to work with the game at all. Often at the start of a level, the game just repeatedly kills the character every second until you reset the game. It's often choppy. It definitely has promise, and there's some fun to be had even in this state.","October 12, 2015","true","2.0"," 44 of 57 people (77%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","77","44","57","6","6"

It absolutely kills the game for me, and makes even simple and easy levels frustrating. This does make timing more important, but the fact that it complicates basically everything else makes the experience unenjoyable. There are several moments where you have to mash back and forth on the arrow keys to time a jump across an obstacle, or even doing it between two different obstacles, because you can't stop running. The objective of the game then goes from scaling walls and avoiding obstacles to figuring out how to get around the auto-running to successfully navigate.\n\nThe controls are also a bit frustrating. Delay in inputs means you have to make yourself jump or turn earlier than you want to, which probably isn't that bad until you play a level where optimal timing is essential. It showcases the downsides really boldly. Wall-jumping is the absolute hardest thing to do, as you'll either not jump when you want to in some cases, or not go far enough to the other side of the wall. There's even a glitch where your mummy climbs an invisible wall all the way up to the ledge. It's frustrating and hard to really replicate; it just tends to happen. It's amusing at first as well, until you run into an obstacle or fall because of it, and you may not even realize what's happening at first. When you're wall-jumping to avoid obstacles, it's a run killer. And I don't usually feel like it's my fault when I die, unlike other hard games, because the controls don't feel responsive.\n\nThere are other small glitches and bugs that aren't bad on their own, but dampen the experience overall. More than once have I wall-jumped, only to jump through the wall into my death. Some cases, I'll land inside the wall and can move around and jump out. I had to quit the game and reboot it when I beat the tutorial because no menus would pop up for me otherwise. Collision detection seems finicky, as I'll apparently have gotten into an obstacle when it seems like I've cleared this. This is most evident with the crocodile pit, but I'm willing to excuse that as just needing to be extra sure I clear it.\n\nThere are good things however! I like the vibe and aesthetic of the game, and the music wasn't annoying like most games in this genre tend to be. While you can only really jump over obstacles, the variety of traps and the methods in which they kill (or even affect) you is pleasant and refreshing. The ability to complete challenges and earn stuff at a decent enough rate is appreciated if one doesn't want to purchase any of the microtransactions, so you don't feel like you're grinding just to grind. On smaller notes, I appreciate that not only can you reduce the quality of the game, but even at the lowest settings for quality, it still looks really nice. Except for some hiccups in the period between dying and resetting, the game runs really well on my piece-of-♥♥♥♥ computer.\n\nThe ability to play others' levels and rate them and compete on leaderboards for each level is appreciated, but there's a major problem here; you can't preview the map before playing. The most you get is around five seconds to survey the map, no matter how huge or littered with blocks/obstacles (and this includes the time it takes to zoom out to look at the map). You have to essentially dive into these maps blindly, and for maps that are either huge, complicated, or non-linear, this is a killer. I've quit maps several times because of this. Even something small like seeing a preview of the map before I play the level would help incredibly. It would also help so I know when to avoid levels that are essentially auto-completion or not designed well, and allow me to get the most out of the game.\n\nNormally, this isn't the kind of game I'd play, but it's free and Early Access, so I decided to check it out. There's potential, and tightened up and improved on more, I could see myself coming back to this every once in a while to enjoy. But at this stage, I simply can't recommend it.\n\nOther suggestions/nitpicks:\nPlease get rid of that slow clapping when you complete a level. It's really annoying.\nAchievements are always nice!\nA little more diversity in the music so I don't feel like I'm tuning out.\nLabeled menus. I could hardly tell what button to click because none of them were labeled or told me what to do or what function they had.\nLevel of the Day/Week, something to emphasize the community's creations more.","October 14, 2015","false","1.0"," 35 of 47 people (74%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","74","35","47","3","1"

The level editor is poorly implemented, leaving little incentive to try and make an interesting level: especially when the controls make the platforming such a chore in the first place. Menus are also unclear and mostly unlabled. Finally, the game gives you an utterly patronising slow clap when you complete a level: as if I wasn't unimpressed enough!\n\nThe concept is wonderful, but this game is woefully under-developed and not worth playing yet. There's no point in this being in early access, considering that a single-sentance pitch would actually promote this game better.

Though I didn't want to mess with the other half of it (the player/build-your-own sections), I enjoyed the developer levels available. I appreciate not having the auto run and the controls were fairly intuitive. I notice a lot of people complaining about the view. I think it is a good distance, though I will admit I exited out of a level or two so that I could see the whole layout of the level again. If the object is to get a quick idea and then stumble your way through a trap-filled maze, this works very well. However, if it's just to get through the levels, it'd be nice to have a "bring up the map" button--it could even keep the sand running. Other things to note: It was extremely frustrating to die merely touching the dropping foot, even if it wasn't dropping; there is a dun-dun-dun glitching sort of sound whenever I hit respawn; and it has cute artwork.","October 28, 2015","true","0.9"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","78","7","9","3","1"

Pyramid Raid plays like a "runner" game with the added bonus of wall jumping thrown in here and there, when you add timed traps to that you can get a game that's pretty decent. The game comes with a level maker so you can also make and share your own courses with other players, and to top it off you can customize your mummy a little bit for added flavor.\n\nI liked Pyramid Raid, but overall there is nothing exceedingly special about the game. It can be fun, and I recommend you try it if you are into playing free indie games, otherwise there just is not that much here.

I only have small things to pick on the developers about. I wish the view when running was a bit wider. The traps really aren't difficult to navigate. A lot of them just require you to jump. The only reason I ever really die is when they come on the screen to fast and I can't process it. It can get more annoying that difficult. I also don't like the auto-run thing you have going. It makes it harder for people to navigate some jumps and it would be better if you could easily control when you run and when you stop. Honestly, you just need something that will make a player have time to analyze a trap rather than it just appearing directly in front of you. Also, traps that you do more than just jump over.

This is one of those games. I can't really 'Recommend' it, but NOT recommending it, kinda makes you sound like an ♥♥♥, and it's free to play too, so..\n\nMaybe it's not for anyone other than children at this point. Because there is really nothing in the game right now. You are a mummy and you just jump, jump, and then jump. And then finish the level. If you don't die, that is. So a child may have fun with it. But I don't see why anyone should kill their time with this right now.\n\nI played the first 10 levels and then a bonus level. And I was pushing it. Having fun doesn't really describe it, it was more like ploughing through the levels and 'Let's get this done and out of the way' kind of experience.\n\nSo anyway, pros:\n\n+ Character design is funny (mummies and ♥♥♥♥) (supposed to be scary but it's kind of funny)\n+ Dying animations are funny\n+ Music\n\nThat's about it really, now on to the cons:\n\n- No content other than the foundation features of a platformer (jumping, dying, traps)\n- Game feels kind of empty, because all you do is jump over the same obstacles over and over again,  trying not to die, and all for just reaching the end of the level. Then what? Next level. Wow exciting.\n- Can be frustrating sometimes (for example, the character jumps excessively, making you jump INTO the traps on the walls. I think jumping needs to be toned down a bit.\n\n***All in all, it's an early access game, so obviously there is going to be a lot of stuff added to the game in time.

Even for a an early access game, this game has ridiculous bugs that should have been fixed before going public. Bugs such as sometimes climbing up an invisible block while trying to walljump, or if you jump fast enough just going straight through the wall. All of this could be forgiven, but for some reason the creator decided to make you have to pay for items in the in game shop, but the only way to gain money is to play levels, or for people to beat yours. This creates two problems:\n1. You start with hardly any money whatsoever. I think you get enough for 3 or 4 spikes. That's hardly enough to make a level that's difficult or interesting.\n2. The fact that you gain money for simply having people beat your levels gives absolutely no inscentive for you to make them difficult, or even possible to fail. Why would you, when that only cuts down your profits. In the current version of the game, there is absolutely nothing stopping me from just making a level that has the start and exit next to each other. That is not good game design.\n\nThis game needs to be thoroughly improved before anyone should even consider playing it, never mind spending their hard earned cash on it.","October 18, 2015","false","0.5"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","1"

If they had a better level builder with more options I'd probably be building more than playing.

Now they remove the level editor and most of the game and want you to pay for it. If it was a better game i would pay for it but this is probably the worst game ive played the puzzles were terrible with no imagination in making them.
