Your character can walk, run, slide, jump, double-jump, wall-jump, climb walls and even hang and move on ceilings. This variety of movements opens up to a lot of exploration in the levels, and such exploration is rewarded with lots of in-game money and hidden collectibles. The in-game money can be used to buy upgrades and costumes.\n\nThe levels are huge, with plenty of side-corridors or side-paths where you can find items. Since I wanted to explore every inch of each level, I often got tired before reaching the end. Slightly shorter levels (i.e. splitting each level into two) would be good.\n\nThe combat has a fast short-range attack (which you will end up using almost all the time) and a long-range attack, as well as a couple of gimmicks (left-trigger + short attack, or right-trigger on top of an enemy) that are a harder to pull off, and slow down the action as the camera freezes in a bullet-time fashion. This kind of effect gets old very quickly and breaks the flow of action.\n\nThe character has a stamina meter (for stuff such as running) and a health meter. The health regenerates when not taking damage.\n\nDue to the amount of buttons used (4 buttons and the 2 triggers used as digital input), it might be a bit cumbersome to play on keyboard. I can't say about it, because I used a controller.\n\nAlthough each level is huge, the game is a bit short, as this was meant to be the first episode in a multi-episode saga. And the storytelling in this game is not very good, I had the impression the levels did not follow any logical order, I haven't seen connection between most levels. (For comparison, "Sonic 3" storytelling is perfect!)\n\nOverall, this game is okay. Between "Yes!" and "No!" I give this game a "Meh".","October 8, 2014","true","8.9"," 66 of 76 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","66","76","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/9940/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","Blade Kitten is a charming game when you first start it up. The main character, Kit Ballard, is a spunky cat-girl who happens to be a bounty hunter with a new rival in town. The look of the game is cheery and bright, and the promise of a fun rivalry-based adventure sets the scene nicely. Although they say first impressions are generally the most important, this rule doesn't really apply to Blade Kitten. The game starts strong, but fizzles quickly due to some awkward mechanics, technical issues, and a paper-thin story.\n\nKit Ballard, as a main character, is interesting enough, and certainly fills the cat-girl "moe" archetype satisfactorily. However, the story, which starts off strong, falls into the "chase" trope fairly quickly, and becomes no more than snippy remarks and chase scenes during cutscenes. Although the lead and her rival certainly have their personalities, they just aren't enough to keep you engaged in the story.\n\nHowever, since this is a relatively cheap game, a lax story might be forgivable. What isn't, however, is bad gameplay mechanics. The game's world is futuristic, and characters seem to hover around on a lessened gravity planet, which sounds cool in theory, but in practice proves to be quite frustrating. The game's levels feature platform-based gameplay, which means precision-based running and jumping is a must. However, the low-gravity properties of the game mean that there is a lot of skidding around, and you can't stop on a dime or take off at full speed. Though this isn't much of an issue in the beginning, you'll find the sliding mechanic increasingly annoying as the game progresses and you encounter "trap" levels that require precision button pressing and obstacle avoidance.\n\nAnother aspect of the game's mechanics that gets agitating quickly is the swordplay. Blade Kitten’s weapon of choice is a big, floating sword that can attack enemies near and far with quick or ranged attacks. However, the problem with the sword is that it only works half of the time. For instance, sometimes I would target an enemy from a distance, and when my ranged attack was unleashed, the enemy would still be standing there. Even the quick attack was flawed, and hammering on the swift attack button when encountering several enemies at once never yielded the results that I hoped. The floating sword mechanic could have really been cool, but with the lack of precise targeting, the sliding controls, and the lack of consistency in battle make this weapon more of a chore to deal with rather than an exciting gameplay component.\n\nThe game's mechanics really handicap this title and cause it to fall short of its potential. And the real tragedy of this is that the level design is actually quite good. Though the game takes a traditional approach to the side-scrolling aspect, there are multiple paths you can take through each level, and there are tons of bonus areas with treasure chests to explore. However, these areas are normally hidden behind puzzles and switches, which can be difficult to hit because of the wonky controls. On more than one occasion, I passed by treasure-filled bonus areas because I simply wanted to finish the level instead of trying to suffer sliding around trying to hit switches in a precise manner.\n\nBlade Kitten's level design is also a missed opportunity in the visual area. Though there are plenty of hidden areas and things to explore, none of it looks particularly interesting. Levels generally find a comfortable color scheme, insert a few new elements, and stretch these few elements into an overarching world. This type of visual scheme is not only boring to look at, but can also be disorienting, as backtracking to similar areas can get you seriously lost if you are trying to find a certain area that looks like another part of the stage.\n\nThe only aspect of Blade Kitten that is consistently good is the animated cutscenes. Although most of these are brief with forgettable dialogue, the cutscenes are animated in a very high-quality cel-shaded style. All the animations are fluid, and the game really hits all the right notes for the anime style they wanted. The main characters feature some fun facial expressions and lightning-fast movement. However, even the cutscenes are hampered by poor voicework, which often comes across as wooden and completely unemotional.\n\nAs far as replay value is concerned, Blade Kitten definitely doesn't have much going for it. Although the game has several unlockable items, including new weapons, costumes, and battle-enhancing consumables, the game's currency is dispersed a little too liberally, and it is very possible to unlock all of this content before you've even reached the halfway point. This might be a good thing if you are just trying to run through the game, but if you are looking for a game you can play and then explore, Blade Kitten doesn't have much for you.\n\nBlade Kitten certainly could have been a good game. It started out promising, and I was excited to experience an old-school platforming title with fun characters that played off the anime/manga tropes we've all seen over the years. However, what I got was a game with bad mechanics, repetitive level design, and little incentive to keep playing past the first few levels. Overall 6/10.","August 16, 2015","true","10.4"," 37 of 41 people (90%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","90","37","41","2","2"

After 5 years Blade kitten has gotten it's episode 2 and conclusion. Was it worth the finish though? One way to find out, isn't there?\n\nBlade kitten is a Platformer developed by Krome studios and released by Atari in 2010. If you're familiar with either, you'd know that Krome Studio's made a previous platformer game on the Gamecube and other consoles called "TY: The Tasmanian Tiger." which is a game that personally I've had a lot of good experiences with when I was younger. Sure, the voice acting was cheesy and some game mechanics were irritating as sin. But it was a fun game. And if you know about Atari, you know they went bankrupt some time ago, but I'll get to that later.\n\nIn Blade Kitten, you play as Kit Ballard. Essentially a catgirl with an interesting hair genetic, but realistically she is part of a rare(?) alien race called the Felion's. It looks like "Felines" but is pronounced differently, get it? Anyways, her job is to be a breaker; which is the game's essential equivalent of a Bounty hunter. Hunts targets, get paid. Usual stuff. First person she runs into is her soon to be rival but not main antagonist; Justice. Blonde woman working for an evil-ish military group known as the Sollers.\n\nGameplay is simple stuff. The game runs entirely on a 2.5D plane. 3D models but the game always sticks to it's camera angle; and the game's entire system runs as a platformer. Kit's attacks focus on a hovering "Breaker Blade" which can be swung at melee range, or sent out at a distance. You can hold RMB to spear people's armor or shields, or just to yank them in. There's also special attacks, like a Q to mount and throw soldiers by the head.\n\nThere are a few kinks to work out though, that's unusure if they'll ever get fixed up. First off, Episode 1 was originally designed for consoles. It shows when the "how to play" is just a bunch of symbols with no real display on what you're /supposed/ to press. The only one that does show this is the loading screens, and if you have even remotely decent of a computer it wont be around long enough to read. The Enemy AI can also be seen as unfair at times, countering hits from you are most of the basic enemies 90% of the time.\n\nWith Atari closing down in a later year and stopping development of Blade kitten Ep2, there was a pretty long hiatus. But now we have it. Episode 2 has nicer animations, a more consistent 60 FPS and a rather shiny level design! Plus, all the original characters voice actors and new content to boot. It's fun stuff, and was a nice wrap-up for the series.\n\nPro's\n------------\n+Decent Level design\n+Lovely world-building\n+Slipped in references of older games\n+Level keeps up with you, allowing the player to go pretty damn fast at times.\n+Slippery, almost wild yet usable controls.\n\nCon's\n------------\n-Some enemies are downright irritating\n-Climb command registration can be sometimes odd\n-Some map bugs\n-Enemy's can be expoited using Wild controls, making bosses rather easy.\n\nVerdict: Buy it if it interests you. There /is/ a demo, so try that first.\n\nThanks for the efforts Krome Studios, I'm glad you didn't leave the game for dead.","March 18, 2015","true","18.3"," 29 of 31 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","29","31","0","1"

Blade kitten on PC used to be pretty bad when it first came to PC, with some kind of stuttery frame rate limiter which made me feel nauseous playing it.  The dev though NEVER GAVE UP!  Just like Blade kitten the dev not only stayed active on the forums, but kept updating the game for PC to resolve these issues.  The voice acting in the game is really awesome with lots of costumes to unlock and powerups to buy.  A simple platformer game, probably one of the few ever made where the controls WORK!  Crawling up walls, makes exploring the levels pretty fun, like any platformer its not the combat that makes the game its the controls, the feel, and the exploration.  From having a little pet to the animations in the game, all of them are awesome!  Replay value is high since the controls are simple, even if you forget them like I did there isnt any move that complex like other games, this game you can pick it up play it, quit anytime, then go back and BOOM right back at the checkpoint.\n\nRating:  10/10  Value:  $14.99","June 4, 2014","true","28.7"," 32 of 36 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","32","36","0","1"

There. I said it.\n(Bonus points for the additional gothic dress for our cat girl heroine. Me-ow!)\n\nBlade Kitten is a 2.5D, action-platforming game starring Kit Ballard, a cat girl (in an optional gothic dress) who controls a levitating AI sword and is followed around by some weird flying pet... thing, as she does battle against various factions out to get her while she tries to reclaim a data stick stolen from her and get payback for her destroyed ship. Or something. The whole story is a bit of a mess. There's very little real explanation for who anyone is or how they're all connected or ultimately what's going on. The story and apparent goal seems to shift dramatically from one level to the next with little real sense of focus for anything, just a vague over-arcing narrative that's sporadically dropped then brought up again at whim.\n\nI presumed there was more to this than meets the eye and, indeed, found the game to be based on a web comic of the same name. It looks like it's been going for quite a while, but despite an intensive Google search for what must have been at least a good minute and a half, if not two whole minutes, I still couldn't really find out much about the material it's based on. The lack of explanation (aside from a brief in-game glossary) would suggest it's aimed at established fans, but if it's as obscure as it appears to be then that's a huge misstep and is essentially shooting itself in the foot from the start. The story elements aren't offensively bad or anything, and I guess you'll get the basic gist, but I just wish it would've kept its attention on one thing rather than feeling like it was cramming in every feature of its universe to appease fans who the developers probably thought would be annoyed if their favourite parts weren't included. The mostly useless pet, Skiffy, being a pretty glaringly obvious example of something from the lore being shoehorned into some kind of role in the game.\n\nBut despite the way it was presented, I did still really like the universe that we're shown (and the gorgeous art style in particular) and would be happy to learn more about it. I want to know more about this flying, AI sword, dammit! The lead is very well written and acted, and I never felt like the game was talking down to the player and treating us like idiots. In fact, the game, and Kit herself, come across as somewhat self-aware without ever breaking the fourth wall, and as a result feels far more inclusive and engaging. But as for the supporting cast? Mmm, not quite so much. They're more standard, video game fare.\n\nThe actual gameplay is far more successful, though. You'll run, leap and hack your way through 13 stages, searching for secrets, unlocking costumes and buying new swords and upgrades. But the main appeal of the game comes from Kit's agility and dexterity, as she sticks to just about every surface to climb along walls and ceilings, opening up huge potential for exploration. That's something that might actually throw some players, in fact. Most platformers are about running a gauntlet as you overcome obstacles of one kind or another to reach the finish. But in this one you'll spend far more time roaming the occasionally labyrinthine stages, sometimes wondering whether the path you've taken is where you're supposed to be going, or if you're unwittingly making your way towards the dead end with the collectibles. But once you know your way around and how to best deal with enemies (jump over them, innit), most of the stages can be speed run in around about five minutes.\n\nWhen you are engaging in combat, you'll probably have a little less fun than when you're running around. There aren't a great deal of enemy types, and the majority of them will be dealt with in largely the same manner; either rush up to them with a flurry of light, but fast slashes, or send your floating sword off to deal heavy, ranged strikes. You can also jump on some enemies and toss them around, or do a jumping ground stomp attack for crowd control, but from moment to moment, you'll mostly just be cutting up the waves of fodder then running along. It's pretty trivial stuff for most of the game, thanks largely to your regenerating health as well. But, to be honest, I'd rather them be easy than have them kill the pace and become tedious roadblocks every time they're encountered. Also, the controls aren't quite tight enough for anything too challenging, either. Most of the time they're fine (I played it entirely with a game pad), but every so often it felt unresponsive and I'd suffer because of it. Was never too major, but enough to be a noticeable annoyance.\n\nSo, it's not perfect. The story is muddled, the combat and enemies are kinda uninspired and some more moves or combos would've been nice, the levels can sometimes confound, and the controls could be improved. But even so, I did still really enjoy this one and felt the fun and easy-going positives far outweighed the negatives. Especially the price. It's kind of a steal how much game you're getting for so little. So if you like platforming, exploring and cat girls in gothic dresses, then this has your name writing all over it. Well... at least if your name is Blade Kitten.

Kit Ballard is funny, smart, cute and badass kitten with really sad past; and when I play fun-to-play character with actual character, game is always better for me.\nHollow Wish is world we play in and is lovely to look at, but dangerous to explore because of various enemies that makes your life harder. Some of them are really easy to get rid off, but you will find some tough and annoying mothereffers here as well.\n\nEliminating single targets, or smashing thru hordes of enemies is fun and enjoyable; but sometimes it is really far from it, because when you find yourself in siege of enemies from left and right and they are upon you, closer then you wish, and it is really difficult to get out of their deadly grasp. And besides few glitches events, this is probably my only complain for this game.\n\nAs story goes.

Some of the puzzles are okay, the rest of the game is not. Even with a gamepad, platforming basics like double-jumping or long running jumps are hampered by the game thinking it knows better than you and auto-aiming jumps. Combat is clunky and it is easy to get stun-locked to death by enemies. But by that same token, there's no challenge, as you respawn with no penalty and checkpoints are incredibly common. The sword selection is passable, but the only other upgrades are HP and Stamina ups, and nothing really unique. You CAN dress your character in a selection of very stylized japanese costumes if you like, but once you realize you're playing in pajamas and bunny slippers, it loses its appeal. The worst part is the voice acting, however. The protagonist never misses a chance to spout squeaky cutsesy dialogue in a voice that grates on the ears. I stopped hunting down treasure chests because I couldn't stand to hear another "Win Get!" or "Awwwwwlright!" It even does it when auto-aiming your jumps for you.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DeltaBladeX/recommended/9940/","DeltaBladeX","DeltaBladeX","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DeltaBladeX/","4044 products in account","Blade Kitten is a platformer based on a web comic about the adventures of Kit Ballard, a bounty hunter. You will run, jump and attack through the 14 levels in this game in your quest to hunt down your current target.\n\nStory\nWhile this game is based on a series of web comics, knowledge of them isn't required, as the game is set three years before the events in the comics. Good for me, since I've never read the series myself.\n\nThe game has several in game cut scenes within most of the levels to bring the story to you, but it isn't anything that interesting. Come to a planet to receive information on your current target, get attacked by a rival bounty hunter, and start chasing after her. Other events happen later after you have caught her, including missions to help random people which just happen to be connected to your target. Rather poor in my opinion, and not likely to get me to read the comic at this point.\n\nPresentation\nWhile not to the level of a professional development company, the graphics of this game are beautiful. The levels have plenty of detail in the background and the characters themselves all look great. The style is well suited for the characters, looking like what you would hope for from 3D versions of comic characters. Certainly a high point of the game.\n\nThe music itself is less impressive. At best, it is forgettable. Fortunately, it never got so bad that I wanted to mute it. Regular sound effects are better. You have attacks, grunts, breaking items, jumping and even some calls from wildlife.  Certainly some hard work was put into these. Lastly, we have the voice acting. More good work here. The voice actors actually used emotion while doing their lines, and the voices were well suited for their characters.\n\nControls\nThis game is most certainly made for a gamepad. Don't even think about trying it with a keyboard. Assuming you own a gamepad, the controls works fine. You have movement on the left analog, some camera control with the right, a jump key, both melee and ranged weapon attacks, defend, dash and interact. Everything you need for this adventure.\n\nGameplay\nNow, this will have a fair bit to chat about. As a 2D platformer collect-a-thon, this really is an enjoyable game, with plenty of secrets to hunt down, earning you the dosh to unlock extra content like weapons, costumes and health / stamina boosters. Getting into the combat, it's not quite so great, but it does the job.\n\nThe levels are mostly linear, with a range of hazards to traverse and plenty of coins lying around for you to grab. But if you are willing to go out of your way by climbing on every surface like this catgirl is capable of, you will find a number of chests, discs and animals around the levels to be added to your inventory. This game tugs at the strings that had us old timers spending hours in titles like Mario or Sonic, and doesn't disappoint here.\n\nNow for the fighting. The basics of this are simple button mashing. Most enemies will present little challenge. However, there will be a few tricky opponents that will require you to use other techniques like blocking or ripping their equipment from them. Those are used so little though, you might just forget you have those skills at the times you do need them.\n\nLifespan\nAs you can guess from a collect-a-thon type game, there is plenty to do after you have beaten the story. Trying to find every item to unlock 100% will take a good while, and completing this task will unlock the remaining costumes that money alone can't purchase. As well as that, there are several achievements to work on, like completing a level without a scratch, taking out 5000 enemies or  having the best time for the levels total 90 minutes or less. Getting all of those should help boost the playtime if you are a completionist.\n\nClosing\nWhile I felt the story and music were near failures, the rest of the game pulls this up to being a title I would recommend to a platformer fan. Unfortunately, sales for the title seem to be uncommon, so you might be looking at full price if you wish to pick it up on Steam.\n\n---\n\nUpdate time\n\nThe devs recently got this series back from Atari, so after some new work, this game has returned to the Steam store. Now featuring some new costumes, cleaned up controls, more challenging AI opponents and even the bonus feature that is Steam trading cards. Even better, Episode 2 is on the way, and the game is now much cheaper. I will heavily recommend people give this a purchase.","July 30, 2013","true","6.8"," 44 of 68 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","44","68","0","0"

It has creative and fun gameplay, and a good and extensive backstory. Plus, now that it is once again under Krome Studios' control, it is no longer a dead title, and is once again actively maintained, with a sequel that is now actually on the way.\nSometimes, the characters can be pretty annoying.

I put off buying it for a long time despite very low price because of a few negative reviews on game mechanics. Turns out those reviews dont know what they are talking about.\n\nYes this game has a few kinks that you should know about combat. There for instance is a kickback during which time you are stunned. This kickback+stun can be stacked on you by multiple enemies resulting in unexpected beatdowns and deaths. We are not talking about La-Mulana type of kickback here that defines the whole combat system but it's significant enough that it should be taken into account. Melee enemies dont let you go once they connect with their blows resulting in half your health going away. You regenerate fast but sometimes its not enough.\n\nAnd what about your weapons and moves? Standard sword slash works well on 1-2 enemies but a group of enemies all at once? your DPS is not fast enough and you dont hit them all so the enemy will retaliate so adjust your tactics accordinly. You CAN take them out most of the time. but not always.\n\nEnemies deliver their blows once they have progressed on their move and some of them are non-interruptible even if they die. The long range sword throw does not connect every time as it works bad in close range. In addition it consumes stamina which is important when you jump around trying to do your moves so it's better to be used when skirmishing or as an opener.\n\nUse your head - your character can easily in normal situations just spam on the normal attack and win. But sometimes even the basic grunt can kick you down from a ledge if they have the height advantage or form a tag-team with another one to beat you up if you fool around too much.\n\nUse that shield of yours.  Jump on top of enemies and throw them. Their bodies trigger doors, switches and even crumbling walls.\n\nAnd what about platforming and levels? Well it sure is overdone. Just the start screens of levels, you can basically just spend 5-15minutes clearing the opening screen. See a ledge? there is a secret there - there always is. Every. single. time. at least money if not a chest or a teleporter to some other area.\n\nArrows tells you to move forward? nope. go back, there is still a ton of secrets or there is a alternative way forward with loot on the way.  I dont recall any other game overdoing secrets the way this game does. A typical level has the arrows pointing where to go but you must do the traditional 'uh-oh, game wants me to go here - i need to go back' -routine as much as possible and instead look for walls and ledges where to jump. or just hang from walls and make your way to seemingly impossible places - where there is a huge section of the level and here you will spend the next 5minutes. In another game called Limbo you got an achievement for 'going left'. this game takes 'go everywhere, there are so many secrets it will take time'  to a whole new level. On average levels last for a very long time so there is plenty to do.\n\nTo sum up the good this game has weapons, upgrades, costumes, nice artwork. good responsive platforming controls and easily learnable combat with small details that you can learn if you like but it's not mandatory. To get ahead in the game you dont need to learn all the details but it sure helps a lot.\n\nI am very entertained this far. Unique game for me. Good looks and interesting stuff to do.\n\n9/10.","January 14","true","10.3"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","12","13","0","0"

The game's fallen on hard times but it's finally getting back up on its feet. It was originally supposed to be an episodic game, which explains why it's so short but problems arose with the crew and budget and the rest of the game was put on hiatus for a few years with only a skeleton crew to slowly move things along. Well, the wait is finally over and soon we'll be getting the next episode in just under a month.\n\nBased on the dev's very own webcomic series, Blade Kitten stars a quirky young intergalactic bounty hunter catgirl named Kit Ballard. The game itself is pretty great if not short and sweet, with classic platforming elements akin to games like Crash Bandicoot. You can also get alternate costumes for your kitty throughout the game without any need for DLC. The game is set in a pretty, alien landscape and the cel-shaded 2.5D artstyle itself is pretty charming and somewhat anime inspired and it all blends together very beautifully.\n\nIf you love platforming/hack 'n' slash games with cute girls, then I definitely recommend this game.

What got my attention was that the character was a feline/human mix (instead of fully human like most action games), the world it took place on, and the overall combat.\n\nI gotten the game few years after watching his videos and enjoyed it myself. However I was having a few tehnical issues but that's due to hardware limitations on my end (shadows hurt my FPS greatly, and have to keep turning them off whenever I start the game).\n\nSometimes the controls would get a bit sticky or respond oddly, and sometimes the collision detection bugs out or has Kit perform a different animation. The combat was overall okay, was difficult to trigger some of the criticals on some blades along with the head-swing attack but takes practice and precise timing and aiming.\n\nThe story is... there but doesn't always transition smoothly as you progress through the game. Not a bad story, but has a few plot holes that may go unnoticed in the first playthrough. The Episode 2 DLC wraps up the story very well, though.\n\nApparently, Blade Kitten was a comic before this game was made. Some parts are mentioned in this game regarding Kit's past but give little detail. I'm not sure what they're like though. I've read some of it after playing the game... seems to be alright.\n\nI'd get this and the ep. 2 DLC in a bundle than separately, save you some money.\n\nAlso, some of the outfits are so darn cute! ^_^","May 2","true","24.4"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

It would be so much better if the collision detection was loosened up, because it feels more jarring like a 2D Sanic Hegehog game in that you can perform all these incredible moves but get stopped up every few seconds and it takes longer than I appreciate to recover.

Side-scrolling platformer with blade fighting. Nice graphics that don't try to be too realistic keeping it's own colorful, animeish charm, a few characters, lots of different items to collect, 5-8 hours to play (takes a lot more if you are trying to find and buy everything) and the best; a bounty hunter Kit Ballard, the nekomimi and main character of the game. After the game got back to Steam, many things changed from the first release. Controlling Kit is better and the game got a little bit harder. Especially at the beginning you notice that if you aren't prepared, you find yourself dying many times in a row. But, after you get to know the controls, know what attacks work best for different enemies and buy yourself new blades and extend your HP and stamina, you will beat the game pretty easily. The soundtrack and levels were nice and I loved the hints of Ty the Tasmanian Tiger.\n\nThe shortness of the game made me pretty sad and the ending just wasn't right (Episode 2 is seriously needed). Also the story... Okay, it was something that you couldn't understand that well if you hadn't read the comic (wink wink, you can read a little bit of it in BK's official site). Sometimes there weren't actual story going on, you just killed enemies and tried to proceed (and find stuff maybe). But that didn't really matter. I just kept playing.\n\nOtherwise I enjoyed the game. I loved how Kit could climb almost everywhere and the humour of the game was something that got me. Even after beating the game I'm still playing it trying to find and buy all the stuff. While the game may not be the best platformer and especially not the best game of Krome Studios (I've been always a huge fan of Krome's games). It still has it's own charm and fun. If you are a too serious gamer with picky and hardcore taste, this isn't for you. Nekomimi girls can be pretty cruel 'ya know, but if you really don't like cute-looking catgirls, stay away if you aren't into the platforming part of the game. My score for the game would be 7/10.","May 25, 2014","true","41.0"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

As someone that grew up with the likes of Spyro, Crash Bandicoot, and Ty, it took me back to my PS2 days in terms of gameplay.  It's a fun hack n' slash that takes you to Hollow Wish as a bounty hunter Felion (cat person-y...thing)  Since its re-release, the controls have gotten tighter and the AI responds better.  One on one, most enemies will pose no major threat.  In fact, many are susceptible to one certain type of attack or another. But when you are swarmed with Darques, trying to get that last fragging item you need and you keep dying to sludge projectiles and you break two keyboards in a blind rage because THEY ARE EVERYWHERE...you'll understand the difficulty isn't in just completion.  It's in the 100% completion.\n\nThe story itself may be lost on those that haven't read the comic by the same name, but that didn't prevent me from enjoying it any less.  (If anything, I went to the Blade Kitten site and read what Space Captain Steve had up there.)  For fans of the comic, there are plenty of costumes to giggle over, and enough cameos to make a fun episode.  Sadly, there was no Alamo or Gatty in this one, but you can unlock Justice, Lucy, Sun Dae costumes.  Through the game, you avoid deathly lasers, noinks in red suits, and the occasional visit from Cthu--FALDERDAN, RUN!  The goal is to wander through this planet, beat up the crook, and make a nice profit while you are at it.  But our protaganist, Kit Ballard, finds that she's taking jobs and not asking enough questions.\n\nThe world is bright and colourful, with a lot of fast paced action and some precise jumping.  It's cartoony, which I like and is rare to find in a market over-saturated with hyper-realistic FPSers, Racers, and Sports titles.  The background/foreground interplay give the platformer a sense of added depth and deception, as many of the goodies are stashed in places you'd overlook or not even notice.\n\nThe sound quality is pretty crisp and clear.  The music is upbeat, which I like, and lends to the overall cartoony world.  Every so often, you'll hear someone screaming, "Situation: Oscar Mama Golf" and get a cheap giggle.  They also have some sound queues, hinting at certain items being in the area.  The voice acting was okay, but a lot of the voices were re-used, making the few NPCs you get to talk to sound flat and dull.\n\nThe game is by no means the best of its genre.  At times, you can glitch through certain walls and fall into puddles of toxic waste causing insta-death.  Other times, you may get annoyed at the sudden white distortion splashed against your screen.  And some of the cutscenes (in my experience, the final cutscene) begin playing the audio before you even complete the fight, so you had two sets of audio playing when the scene actually starts.  I had a few crashes after hours of gameplay.  And in one cutscene, Kit glitched out looking something akin to the Ben Drowned statue.  But you aren't spending $60 dollars on this title.  For the price, I would definitely recommend this game.\n\nWith the return of control of this title back to Krome Studios, there are plans to release the second episode of this bright story.  Do not be fooled.  The game is -not- dead.  It was just sleeping for a long time in AtariLand.\n\nTLDR:  The game is fun, hack'n'slash goodness.  A little glitchy in unimportant places.  For $6 bucks, it's worth it.  Even moreso if you can snag it for $3.  7.5/10","May 25, 2014","true","26.1"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

I dig the quasi-JRPG style and a lot of the game design is actually rock solid. It has good platforming elements, good exploration, secrets to find, weapon upgrades, costume unlocks. The combat seems a little sketchy at first, but it makes more sense once you realize that the game expects you to take a more leap-and-dodge, hit-and-run approach to combat (especially don't forget about that slide kick!) instead of  running in with blade swinging like a berserker.\n\nUnfortunately, I don't feel like I can recommend the game because the controls are just way too sketchy. Controlling the character does not feel as responsive as it should, which really detracts from the fun of playing an ultra-agile type character. There are also a lot of buggy behaviors with walls and floor when you move the character eratically. For example, Kit is supposed to automatically cling to walls and climb them as easily as walking, which she normally does. But sometimes you'll attach to a wall and kit will automatically start climbing down and will keep climbing down even though you're not pressing the controls, and will keep climbing down even when you press up to get her to go the other way. I also experienced a situation several times where, if you throw up her shield/hold move where she stabs her blade into the ground, but you do it around an edge coming out of a fall, she will sometimes fall halfway through the floor, so only her head is sticking up out of the ground. Also, within the first ten minutes of playing, I somehow managed to get kit stuck in the shield/hold position where she would default back to shield/hold every time I stopped walking, and I had to leap around like a crazy monkey for a minute to get her to stop doing it. These are but a few of the "buggy but passable" behaviors you may experience.\n\nThe aesthetic is great, the attitude is great, the game design principles are rock solid. Really the only thing that truly hurts this game is that the character controls do not feel very tight. They are aaalllmost there. It's so close that some people will consider the other positives enough to overlook the loose and shaky controls, and if that's you then buy it up. But I think for a game that is supposed to be an action platformer with hit-and-run combat and ninja-agile character, the controls should be super tight, and they very simply are not.","August 22, 2015","false","1.0"," 14 of 22 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","14","22","0","0"

If you're not invested in the Blade Kitten webcomic, then the story is going to make almost no sense to you whatsoever, as it assumes almost full knowledge of who its characters are and what exactly is going on on the part of the player. That said, at least most of the dialog is snappy and Kit is definitely a fun character to see interacting with everyone.\n\nThe game itself is sort of a Strider-lite, padded out with "COLLECT EVERY SINGLE THING EVER" elements. Attention was paid to making sure Kit was as agile and zippy as the game's title might imply, and stages are huge enough for you to explore around in for quite some time.  Combat however, is largely unsatisfying and the simple weapon upgrades are hardly distinguishable from one another other than attack power and their various special attacks, which all do the same thing anyway (one-hit kill normal enemies).\n\nThe real bummer is Blade Kitten has a ton of technical issues including terrible framerates, dodgy input detection, and Kit getting stuck inside geometry, forcing checkpoint and stage restarts. The technical issues are common enough to become a hindrance, and there's not really anything you can do on your end to fix them.

In fact, a few of the hours I've logged in this game have been spent on the pause menu as I got so bored I started doing other things instead.\n\nThe music is pretty good, and level design isn't half bad. At times it feels like a (good) Crash Bandicoot game, even to the point I'd call it fun! However, that's about all this game does well.\n\nThe game has a currency/upgrade system, which is fine until you realize there's only one weapon worth getting. Most of your money goes into stamina upgrades, as the alternate costumes are bland and uninteresting. Health upgrades should normally be as effective as stamina boosts, but the only times your health hits zero are instant-death situations.\n\nMost of the combat in this game revolves around hitting the attack button until something happens. If you don't have the (very inexpensive, you can get it during the first level) final sword, almost every attack will bounce off and you have to use 'special' attacks which consist of swinging your sword out a bit further and sliding. There's also a ground-pound attack that takes far too much stamina to use.\n\nPlatforming in this game relies mostly on physics. That's not a good thing. You often find yourself stuck on a wall, pushed through the level, or outright unable to run and jump. The game has an aspect of velocity to it that doesn't make much sense in an action platformer. The entire game feels like a poorly programmed ice level with a stamina bar.\n\nNitpicking time? Nitpicking time. There's a section at the end of the game where you're forced to climb long sections of walls while flying bugs attack you. Being attacked while climbing makes you fall. There are enemies with shields that can deal minor damage while stunlocking you, and if there are two surrounding you then you'd better hope you didn't buy any health upgrades. It's best just to run past them as you need to use a special grab attack to take away their shield. Special attacks take stamina, also known as the make-the-game-go-by-faster meter.\n\nThe final boss is well designed. Brings together a culmination of the game's essentials: climbing, running, jumping, and attacking. However it's heavily dampened by the horribly annoying four or so lines of dialogue being constantly spewed and the fact that all of the things I just mentioned are broken. I ended up exiting the game and watching the ending on youtube for a sense of finality. The plot's not even that great, considering you have to read the (not so good by any means) comic series that the game neglects to tell you about.\n\nOverall it's a good port in terms of additional content and playability, but you can't just paint a brick wall red and call it art.","January 12, 2015","false","7.4"," 30 of 53 people (57%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","57","30","53","4","0"

Which I find very odd and I wish the developers would update the game with a more updated, less glitchy control set up. hell, I feel through the level at one point, and I have no idea how I even did that.\n\nOverall, I've been really enjoying this game, but maybe not for the reasons most people enjoy games. yes, it's fun, and that's the main reason I like it, but it also is kinda buggy and I find that oddly endearing.\n\n8/10\n\nIT'S TOO SHORT THOUGH","March 12, 2015","true","5.6"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","6","8","2","0"

Kit is a breaker, which is a bounty hunter, I don't know why they didn't just call her a bounty hunter, maybe due to her close resemblance to Dog the bounty hunter, they wanted to avoid a lawsuit. Kit is also apparently a comic book character, I have not read the comics, but they are probably a treat But they're not as good as Marmaduke\nLook at you sitting at the table, Marmaduke. Who are you to do that? You're just a dog.\n\nIn Blade Kitten, Kit arrives on the planet Hollow Wish in search of a bounty, go figure. But unfortunately, her bounty chip (card?) is stolen by a rival who is, sadly, also not my girlfriend, and Kit has to get it back. What happens after is a journey across Hollow Wish to both get your stuff back, stop the Sols (I think they're called the Sols), and track down your bounty.\n\nThe game uses a typical side scrolling jump and fight collectathon style. Kit, being a cat girl, is very nimble and can move around the terrain easily, and probably do that think where cats lick their legs and it sticks out all weird and stuff. The animations themselves are rather basic and stiff, though they're not offensive enough to ruin the experience. Kit also has what you call a hover blade, which she can use to fight enemies up close or at a distance.\n\nThis is the part where I talk about the environment.\n\nThe game, althought colorful, has rather generic set pieces for you to prowl along through. See what I did there? Cause she's a cat.\nIt almost looks like a cartoon movie from the 90's actually. You have a city made out of some sort of stone substance that isn't brick, you have a sewer level, some cat walk levels (haha), and an open plain level where you can ride around on a weird raptor horse thing.\n\nSpeaking of 90's cartoon movie, the voice actors themselves don't seem all that into it. Kit's manages to get her personality across, but other than that, a bunch of her lines seem ham fisted or half heartily delivered. Much like the gameplay, it is stiff like the whiskey I fix myself every morning to help me forget. Why did I let them die?\n\nAnd further mo- Wait, that's it? It's over? That was like... Two hours. Oh, there's an episode two coming soon, when did this game come out?\n2010? Get out of here.\n\nI guess you can say this game is short of purrfect. It's nothing to write home about, but it's also nothing to hate. If you can get this game for...Three dollars or so, you'll probably be good to go.\nBlade Kitten: waifu wars: the reckoning: HD Edition: Third Strike, only on PS2, gets two kitty claws out of a possible four.\n\nMy favorite mythological creature is the pregnant Chinese woman.\n\nThe Curator, a place where I speak about my deepest and darkest secrets:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/Dickbuttexperience#curation","February 16, 2015","true","2.8"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","64","9","14","12","0"

I don't know if later it will say I have more time or whatever, but yeah.\n\n\nSo Blade Kitten. This game costs around 6 bucks on steam I think. The game is about a teen catgirl in between cute and sexy who uses a floating blade thing to beat the crap out of enemies. The game has some charm and I'm going to come out and admit that I'll be a little biased in it's favor since I adore catgirls <3. With that said the game is pretty average. It doesn't stand out a lot and it has a somewhat generic plot. The game is actually based on a comic or something (which I couldn't get into).\n\nThere are a lot of 'quirky' lines in the game that border on beng the kind of memes I dislike with the soldiers saying things like 'lima oscar lima' which translates to 'LOL' . For some this is comedy. For me it is another reason to not be immersed. Also the phrase 'falterdan' is essentially the ef word for anyone curious.\n\nThe game is pretty silly and mildly comedical, but tries to pull a little balony out of it's butt with a sudden 'seriousness' which wouldn't have been so bad if I didn't find myself sympathizing with the soldiers more than the main character. The soldiers also could make cool characters because they are silly. I guess what i'm saying is that they make bad bad guys and the main bad guy is...lame and generic. Also the final boss is a little bit of an 'i don't care, why am i helping' sort of moment.\n\nThe music is ok, but there isn't a lot of variance. The environment is actually pretty nice and the side scrolling is done pretty well. Platforming isn't really frustrating and the controls work well for what it is. I like the concept of the game and would love to see more catgirls, but I think this game either needs to go full wacky or take a step back and reconsider having the enemies shout 'get her you noinks!' (it means noob for those who don't know).\n\nOverall the game is just a little above average. I like the main character's design and her personality has at least a little depth to it. The game itself is complete and fairly polished. The game runs well, just fails to stand out. Worth 6 or 7 bucks? Debatable. I'd say grab it somewhere beneath 5 bucks though, but it really isn't all that bad.","June 19, 2014","true","3.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Just don't. The protagonist may be a catgirl and the story definitely sounds like some 14 year old's favorite fanfic, but somewhere beneath the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ voice acting and the vainness behind buying costumes for Kit that do nothing but reveal slightly more of her unmentionables lies one of the best platformers to come out for the PC. Although some of the physics can get wonky, especially when climbing up walls, the controls never feel like that big of a burden. The soundtrack is surprisingly great, fusing traditional East Asian rythms and instraments with Electronic music. Graphically, the game is above average for an indie game, but the animations are some of the best I've ever seen; AAA title or otherwise (eat it, Bethesda.) The combat does have a steep learning curve, but where this game really shines is in the exploration.

Oh, and did I mention that the price has been reduced to roughly 1/3 of its original cost with Episode 2 planned to be released at around the same price?\n\nGameplay-wise, Blade Kitten is a solid 2D Action Platformer with tight controls, good physics, decent combat, fun level design, and enough optional exploration/collectibles to appeal to folks who are into that sort of thing.\n\nGraphics-wise, Blade Kitten looks good. The graphics are by no means ground-breaking or cutting-edge, (this is a game from 2010 by a rather small developer, after all) but they serve their purpose by illustrating a colorful and interesting world.\n\nSound-wise, the game is average but adequate. The voice acting is decent and the music (while somewhat forgettable) is by no means unpleasant to listen to.\n\nStory-wise, Blade Kitten is fun and interesting. Kit is an amusing and likeable protagonist, and most of the other characters are amusing and likeable as well. The story so far is incomplete as Episode 1 ends on a cliffhanger, but it left me wanting more and I eagerly await the release of Episode 2.\n\nOverall, Blade Kitten is a solid buy for the price. It's a fun game that will keep fans of the genre entertained and leave them wanting more. If you enjoy 2D Action Platformers with solid gameplay, colorful graphics, and an amusing cast of characters, then I highly recommend checking out Blade Kitten.","June 17, 2014","true","7.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I haven't finished it in one sitting, so it's definitely not short + there are lots of unlockables on each level I haven't found yet, the controls don't seem 100% intuitive at start, but while you get used to them, there's absolutely no problem in navigating at all (just wsad, shift and e to use an action). Voice acting is 100% fine for me, the story isn't FF7-like, but it's fun to follow. The only drawback I have is that the game runs on 30FPS, and it makes my eyes tired since it's quite dynamic ;X.

Worth 100% of the price.\n\nLong version\nThe game is a little funky with the controls but its still fun. It has a nice story with a lot of BAM moments, like BAM now this, BAM now that, BAM boss time. Its cute and funny too, more jokes that make me laugh from a character that is easily loveable and very adorable instead of trying so hard for some over the top meta crap. My play time at the time of this review was 4.2 hours, I only ran to the end of the levels and did not try to collect or replay parts. Not because it was bad but because I like to do things fast, so depending on your play style, thats about how long the game is. It was my own personal preference though. I like to speed run, there was a lot to look at though and now that I beat it on my little speed run I think I'll play it again and take my time .The game isnt perfect, no game really is but it gets a 10/10 from me.

I'd wait for a sale if you are on the fence though.","January 19, 2011","true","20.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Really liked the art design. Dub was acceptable, music acceptable. Gameplay fairly simplicistic, hopefully it will be expanded a little in Episode 2.\n\nPlayed episode 2 as well, and it's boring. It adds a few more costumes and a few more weapons, but overall nothing really changes, the story is not particularly engrossing, the enemies are boring (except for the final boss) and the characters themselves are fairly boring as well.

Gameplay wise it also reminds me a bit of 2014's remake of "Strider" - if you liked that one, "Blade Kitten" might appeal to you too. It's like a "Strider light" in every way (including the much lighter tone) - a fast paced metroidvanian jump'n hack&slash. I really wish there were more games like that out there.\n\n2) Since episode 2 is out, the game is finally complete. If episode 2 is installed, it gets merged seamlessly into the main game to bring it to a conclusion - nice! I like that they took the difficulty up a notch here, too. The game is still rather easy, though, and I wish the bosses were a little bit more challenging.\n\nAnyway "Blade Kitten" is a cute time waster that is easily worth its very moderate "full price".

I was hoping the character would at least have some charisma, and she does, but only in a Bubsy "aren't I cool and edgy" kind of way.\n\nFinal verdict:  don't waste your time on this.","August 16, 2015","false","0.4"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Ten minutes in I was hung over with massive gaming sickness.  Five hours later, I'm only just starting to come around...\n\nThe gameplay is rather standard, using a similar movement system to the space ninja shooter WARFRAME for acrobatic commands, for a platformer: climb, run, jump, and look for secret areas while following a breadcrumb trail of currency.   Honestly, Mario Bros. for the Gameboy did it better.  Despite the flashier graphics and 2.5D scenery, Blade Kitten fell into my gaming litter box.","July 5, 2015","false","0.3"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","2","4","0","1"

I got super bored doing nothing but just climbing every wall and breaking open yet another divergent path over an utterly massive area just to get money to buy items that you really don't need to beat the whole game. There is also no clarity as to which direction is the "right" one so you can't really skip the collectathon, and it feels all about collecting money. It could have really benefitted from more levels that are smaller and more interestingly designed. The gameplay is also very slow and floaty, no satisfying snappiness to the controls, and the combat could have been so much more. The bad asian stereotype shopkeeper was offensive. All that said, they have at least come a long way with the title over the years. It used to run waaaaay worse.\n\nIf you like annoyingly huge open levels where you slowly do almost nothing but collect money for pointless things between fairly boring cutscenes, get this. If you like satisfying platforming, fun action, tight and engaging controls, and requiring skill, you may want to go for something like Shantae or Freedom Planet instead.","June 24, 2015","false","11.4"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

I can deal with very poorly written Japanese-wannabe teen dialogue ("Win Get!" "Situation Oscar Mike Golf!" (yes, the enemies say OMG) "Do want!" and more) and the awful voice-acting. I can deal with the weird implications of a cat-girl collecting bagged goldfish and the button-mashy fighting.\n\nWhat I can't deal with is broken mechanics and lazy development. Melee enemies that can attack you from a different plane than you, so you can't hit them back. The player being pushed off the correct plane, dropping you through the world. No dead-zone on the control stick, so you are forced to move in a direction if you want to do a slide (which is mainly a combat move). No indication when the overhead grab will and won't work, and using the same button as the wall-grab, sticking you to a ceiling if you're too close during combat, which you can't attack from. Enemies continuing to attack you while you're in an attack animation against them. Being stun-locked by constant staggering attacks (and sometimes map hazards) for 20+ seconds, until death.\n\nAnnoyances include: Fast stamina usage and slow regen. Run-jumping becomes a long-lump and you lose the ability to double-jump, meaning if you're running and want to do a jump up to a higher level, you will instead shoot off the side. No benefits to collecting collectables besides completionism.\n\nNow, the gameplay itself is fine. Bland, but it works, for the most part. But this is no Strider, and the plot will send you to sleep, only to be woken up by the occasional cringe when the protagonist speaks.","March 7","false","7.7"," 10 of 21 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","10","21","0","0"

The game tries to explain this parry system it has, but the system is horribly flawed. supposedly you can deflect an incoming attack by tapping the attack button right when they attack but it never seems to work and i can't figure it out. most of the time my character just flinches if an enemy just looks at them funny and it's just a really bad exprience all around.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/whatisarat/recommended/9940/","whatisarat","Dangerous Beans","http://steamcommunity.com/id/whatisarat/","407 products in account","I only played this game for a little while, and it has some problems, but the reason I stopped playing is that I was getting motion sickness from the camera zooming in and out, which is my problem rather than a problem with the game.\n\nI was on the border about how to rate this. The controls are 'iffy', and I really hate that I can't map movement to the d-pad instead of the gorram analog stick, especially since the game requires quick turns during combat and analog sticks can 'whiplash' and make you end up facing the wrong direction (this happened to me A LOT during play). Most of the control issues are really because the character just has too much going on and the controls aren't really locked down to any single mechanic, so even walking around feels floaty, and jumping is pretty ridiculous in some cases. You can stick to walls and cielings and climb around on them, you can also do Metroid-style wall jumps in cases where you can't stick to the wall. There's also these weird glowy things that try to make you land on them while jumping if you're anywhere near them. The tip sign says they're only supposed to draw you in if you hold the L-trigger, but it seems that they're always on instead. In any case, the controls are functional but need work before they can feel natural and repsonsive.\n\nCombat is sort of bad. I mean I was only in the first stage, but the problems were immediately evident, and I expect them to get worse as the game progresses. The main problem is that your stun animation is extremely slow, and you're not invulnerable during it, so it's incredibly easy to get stunlocked just by standing too close to an enemy, let alone between two. To add to the frustration, the enemies seem to be invulnerable during their close-range attacks, so you can get into some really crappy situations that aren't fun or challenging, but simply frustrating.\n\nThe character dialog isn't childish, but simply corny. I had though that we had advanced as a society since the early 90's, but clearly I was wrong: We've simply added memes into the vocabulary of "things that kids say".\n\nDespite all that, this is a workable platformer, and some of the moves are cool when you pull them off. I got the game on sale, and I don't really feel bad about it, despite not being able to play because of my motion sickness, which - again - is not the game's fault; I'm just overly sensitive to certain camera movements.\n\nIn the end I decided to vote up because when I was originally considering the purchase I saw a number of very concerning issues being raised in the negative reviews. They almost all turned out to be bunk, or at least far less of a problem than was being indicated. For instance, a couple reviewers said that there's no way to block. There are - in fact - two ways to block. You can simply hold the attack button for half a second, or you can use the L-Trigger to activate your shield and grab onto the ground. There doesn't appear to be any limitation on this either. You can sit there for days and the shield soaks up all the damage, so I'm not sure what that was all about. Additionally, some reviews rightfully cited control issues, but wrongfully exaggerated them to apocalyptic proportions. The controls feel floaty and sometimes wall-gymnastics don't go how you planned them, but they are entirely workable, and I've certainly seen a lot worse on more expensive games. Finally, the stunlock issue was presented by some as game-breaking. It's annoying and frustrating, but it's also very easy to deal with if you just activate the shield for a moment and then jump out of the crossfire between attacks.\n\nAnyway, that's my 2 bits.","January 9, 2015","true","1.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Blade Kitten looked interesting at first glance, but it wasn't able to keep up with that first impression. The story as far as I played was non-existent other than chasing a blonde girl just to exchange insults when you catch up so she can run off again. That's it. No reason, no explanation, no world-building whatsoever. It's a catgirl with a sword chopping up lots of generic guards. I wasn't expecting a literary marvel but come on I at least want some kind of plot thread that's not out of a Tom and Jerry cartoon.\n\nThe combat did not gel with me either. Combat for the most part consists of swinging the sword, and having it blocked, or trying to swing the sword and getting stunlocked by two enemies kicking you repeatedly. I looked at the Blade menu and found out the swords had stats, but they don't seem to do anything. I bought the Grengis which had near max stats in all categories except Recharge, while boasting that it would break through any defense. Hah, no. No change at all in combat. I still get blocked and kicked and stabbed. It also doesn't help that everything is extremely floaty, so there's no feeling of solid control. More like I'm sliding around and slashing haphazardly.\n\nAll in all I don't recommend Blade Kitten. There's nothing worth playing here unless you really happen to like pink-haired catgirls that the game tries to tell you is a top-tier bounty hunter with a serious face.","May 22, 2014","false","1.6"," 1 of 10 people (10%) found this review helpful","10","1","10","0","0"

Based on the Blade Kitten comic (fans can buy the 3 already published issues or read them online in the game's website, with a new page being uploaded every week), this is a 2.5D (3D scenarios and characters, 2D gameplay) action platformer with great physics and lighting, an engaging story and lots of humour. As you advance in the game, you will be allowed to buy new swords and costumes, which will even reflect in cutscenes.\n\nThe colours, the backgrounds, Kit's animations and the game replayability (you'll always wonder where is that secret you missed on this stage, or how cute/badass will Kit look while performing this attack, or in that cutscene) made me wonder when Blade Kitten Episode 2 would be released.\n\nAlthough it is fully playable with a keyboard, I recommend a game controller.

It looked kind of interesting, so I decided to delve into a bit.\n\nImmediately off the bat, audio levels were through the roof. A really minor complaint, since that's fixable. However when actually playing the game, I realized that other games have used the same mechanics to a much better affect. For example, Kit (the player character) and climb on walls and across ceilings. This mechanic is very much inspired by Strider, though feels much more clunky and not as fun. Jumping and platforming in this game is also not great, as you basically lose control of where you're going to land once you hit the jump button. Also combat does not feel great either. Trying to slash enemies up close results in you getting smacked about and stun-locked, which causes you to resort to your ranged slashes, which drains stamina, which could be used for double-jumps and sprinting and etc., etc. etc.. And as the icing on the complaint cake, the voice acting, primarily of the main character, was annoying. Every time you get a bonus item or die, she'll have some sort of quip that made me want to mute the game.\n\nThough some mechanics are kind of cool (e.g. stabbing your blade into the ground to resist oncoming air currents from giant fans), it just wasn't for me. If you have the money (it's fairly cheap for the base game, realizing this mid-typing, so I probably shouldn't be too demanding) and are feeling brave to try the game, feel free to. However if you're expecting a great 2D platformer with tight controls and good systems, I'd recommend other games like the Strider 2014 game, or just about anything else really.","May 11, 2015","false","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The first episode is great, because they let you explore the levels without hurry and find all the secrets (which are plenty). But the second one has two problems: infinite enemies and too many instances where you have to just run forward non-stop, because something is chasing you.

The story is pretty disjointed, it seems like you just go on random favors for people as you go along. I'm not usually big into story in games so I didn't get much out of it anyhow, but even watching the cutscenes didn't give me much idea of what was going on.\n\nThe gameplay is a lot of 2D platforming. There is a ton of Hex (the currency) to collect in levels, so much so that you can probably find hundreds of different secret paths that can lead you to more. This is a nice touch as you can use the hex to upgrade your character and get more costumes. It encourages exploration, and can lead to spending a lot of time in levels just messing around and finding hex. The platforming itself is generally solid, and climbing allows you to get to a lot of areas without much trouble.\n\nThe combat is one area of the game I didn't much care for. It seems that more often then not the best way to fight is to just abuse overpowered energy skills rather then fight normally. Because of this, fighting becomes quite boring, and it's mostly optional anyhow, which lead me to skip most enemies in the game (of which there are a lot). The amount of enemy spawns which seem endless in some areas seems to encourage that run away playstyle. The combat itself just doesn't have much depth, you can shield, spam attack, or spam energy skills. The boss fights are also pretty\nuninteresting.\n\nI really like the art style of the game, which seems cel-shaded. The character are animated well and I feel like I'm playing an older style console game seeing them interact.\n\nThe game lasted me about 3 hours but it would take much more time to collect everything in the levels, so if you're a completionist you can definitely get your moneys worth. I guess the game is somewhat episodic because it ends without any type of real finish to the story, and there is a Part 2 DLC. This might be something to keep in mind if you want the complete story.\n\nI did enjoy the game, but it could do with some improvements. I'm not sure if I'll go for the DLC at this point, but I might consider it in the future.\n\n7.2/10","July 3, 2015","true","3.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Zenja-soba/recommended/9940/","Zenja-soba","Zenja (James)","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Zenja-soba/","221 products in account","Ok, quick rough and dirty explanation for how this plays using examples:\n\nImagine Megaman Zero, Donkey Kong, Contra Hard Corps. , Metal Gear Rising if it were 2D, and Prince of Persia.\n\n\nI plan on coming back to give a more elaborate review when I play episode 2 (it's got like a Half-Life thing going on). Now for what I was able to type up after playing:\n\nWhatever you consider it a mix of, it's a pretty fun game. I did not intend to sink 4 hours in one sitting playing it. Combat is fast paced, level design is really interesting and rewards exploring. Some levels have multiple routes, or just multiple ways to traverse a route. Plenty of secrets (in the form of chests), a handful of unlockable upgrades and weapons (but nothing too deep), and even unlockable costumes, some of which look really neat.\n\nHowever, despite me really enjoying it and reccomending it, the list of flaws is bigger than the list of benefits, but they're very minor flaws.\n\nThe game isn't the most polished. For instance, cutscenes and scripted segments act strange when just coming from certain gameplay moments (enemies will move and attack but wont hurt you), and the way it restarts cutscenes if you died shortly after is a bit annoying. There's also some design hiccups in some parts. The game doesn't tell you about all the mechanics in the already unhelpful tutorial. In fact, the game will instruct you about shield breaking (hold down B against enemies with sheilds) while you're fighting the last boss (of episode 1). There are other mechanics you will have to find out on your own because the game doesn't even allude to them, such as jumping from a wall while sticking to it with your sword, to name one. I reccomend just trying to experiement with the controls and then move on from the first level.\n\nAbout more superficial complaints, let me start by saying the story leaves much to be desired. We're given no background about the main character, her rival, the world, what a "breaker" is, and the general lore. However, there is a comic that goes along with it, but that shouldn't be an excuse. Though it's not a big deal because of what story there is, it's really only on par with, say, Sonic Adventure 1 (at least this doesn't have plot holes out the ♥♥♥). About the main character, there are things likable about her: She's cute, she has personality,her character is established fairly, and her voice acting is decent. Everything else isn't that great. She can be annoying, has the charisma of a teenage girl, has a vocabulary that contains the words "Epic Fail", and often times says other stupid things. As for the game's graphics, just pretend this is a port of a PS2 game with upscaled graphics and you'll have no complaints. In fact, the game was made by the same devs as "T.Y. Tasmanian Tiger", a 'we too' attempt at making an animal mascot on the PS2. Though let's just say this game redeems them.\n\nLike I said, all of those complaints are very minor compared to this game's stengths, and you should check it out if you like action platformers. Not only does Episode 1 go for less than 2 dollars during any holiday sale, theres a demo. It's just this game might be a turn off at first, but if you keep with it, you will like it for sure.\n\n\nAnother thing worth mentioning is that it's fairly short, about 3 or 4 hours of gameplay, depending. This is because this game was going to be released in parts, but part 2 never came for the longest time untill some time in 2015, 5 years after the initial release. Aparantly there was some legal dispute. Either way, the amount of gameplay for 2 bucks during a sale is a good buy, and there is some replay value. As of writing this, I don't know what episode 2 brings to the table, but I'm sure it's more or less the same thing, just more of it.","June 20, 2015","true","5.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Not to mention that she just seems to be having so much fun with everything that she and all the other characters play off of each other nicely and make it enjoyable to both fight and watch cutscenes.\n\nThe combat is simplistic, mash the attack button and jump around like a kangaroo. Congrats, you've beaten most of the enemies in the game. There's an interesting mechanic where you can do the aerial wall grab move against certain vulnerable targets for an instant kill with an extra cash reward, but sometimes a move will leave an enemy vulnerable and sometimes the same move won't, so it can be really frustrating when someone blocks all your attacks and won't light up for the finish move. Also, the wall grab prefers to grab walls and ceilings rather than enemies, so if you jump up and try to insta-kill an enemy in a room with a low ceiling, you'll be gluing yourself upside down for a second in the middle of the fight. Also, the move is kind of hard to pull off with a keyboard since you need to use the q button in conjunction with wasd.\n\nThe programming is...well it's finicky. Usually the game works fine, but there are plenty of weird parts. For example, often on the instakill move, Kit or the enemy will be in the wrong location and will slowly drift into position while Kit says her taunt. There are some other weird situations like this, but there's one of these actually has the potential to break your game: for context, this is a 2D game with 3D graphics where you're supposed to run along the x-axis and jump on the y, but there are times where Kit accidentaly moves some distance in the z-direction. This can make her collide with background characters and objects which can actually make it impossible to proceed. If this happens, you had beetter hope you left an enemy alive in the current area so that they can kill you and send you back to the checkpoint. I know I'm not the only person who's had this problem as I've seen forum posts about the glitch as well.\n\nThe story has a REALLY bad problem of assuming the player has information that they have no way of learning. Nearly the entire game, I'm wandering around in random directions and eventually reach the place I was appreantly supposed to go to. I would travel right to get to the outskirts of town, Kit would get something that she needs to take to the top building in the town and instead of just backtracking a bit I would for some reason end up in a factory underground that I have to climb out of to get into the city. The entire story just keeps dropping you in random places and say "Okay, go to the Holy Island now" with no indication of which direction it's in or how far you are from it.\n\nHonestly, I recommend the game as it's a fun diversion with some really nice characters. However, the game suffers from some issues with it's programming and its narrative conveyance, so just be aware of that going in.\n\nPS: As a side note, on the first computer on which I played this game, a certain cutscene always crashed the game and made it impossible to proceed. Later, I got a new computer and tried the game again; I started a new game to remind myself about the controls, but then learned that there is only a single save slot in this game, so I had to play the whole thing again (learning that I previously had made it nearly to the end of the game). As such, I can confirm that the game doesn't have much replay value and the second playthrough was a chore. The "Skiffy" scenes where your pet uh, flying...rodent...thing goes off into the foreground or background to perform some task is completely unskippable and the little guy takes his sweet time doing them which made it really hard for me to stay immersed in the high-octane gameplay.","August 27, 2015","true","5.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Now for what I was able to type up after playing:\n\nWhatever you consider it a mix of, it's a pretty fun game. I did not intend to sink 4 hours in one sitting playing it. Combat is fast paced, level design is really interesting and rewards exploring. Some levels have multiple routes, or just multiple ways to traverse a route. Plenty of secrets (in the form of chests), a handful of unlockable upgrades and weapons (but nothing too deep), and even unlockable costumes, some of which look really neat.\n\nHowever, despite me really enjoying it and reccomending it, the list of flaws is bigger than the list of benefits, but they're very minor flaws.\n\nThe game isn't the most polished. For instance, cutscenes and scripted segments act strange when just coming from certain gameplay moments (enemies will move and attack but wont hurt you), and the way it restarts cutscenes if you died shortly after is a bit annoying. There's also some design hiccups in some parts. The game doesn't tell you about all the mechanics in the already unhelpful tutorial. In fact, the game will instruct you about shield breaking (hold down B against enemies with sheilds) while you're fighting the last boss (of episode 1). There are other mechanics you will have to find out on your own because the game doesn't even allude to them, such as jumping from a wall while sticking to it with your sword, to name one. I reccomend just trying to experiement with the controls and then move on from the first level.\n\nAbout more superficial complaints, let me start by saying the story leaves much to be desired. We're given no background about the main character, her rival, the world, what a "breaker" is, and the general lore. However, there is a comic that goes along with it, but that shouldn't be an excuse. Though it's not a big deal because of what story there is, it's really only on par with, say, Sonic Adventure 1 (at least this doesn't have plot holes out the ♥♥♥). About the main character, there are things likable about her: She's cute, she has personality,her character is established fairly, and her voice acting is decent. Everything else isn't that great. She can be annoying, has the charisma of a teenage girl, has a vocabulary that contains the words "Epic Fail", and often times says other stupid things. As for the game's graphics, just pretend this is a port of a PS2 game with upscaled graphics and you'll have no complaints. In fact, the game was made by the same devs as "T.Y. Tasmanian Tiger", a 'we too' attempt at making an animal mascot on the PS2. Though let's just say this game redeems them.\n\nLike I said, all of those complaints are very minor compared to this game's stengths, and you should check it out if you like action platformers. Not only does Episode 1 go for less than 2 dollars during any holiday sale, theres a demo. It's just this game might be a turn off at first, but if you keep with it, you will like it for sure.\n\n\nAnother thing worth mentioning is that it's fairly short, about 3 or 4 hours of gameplay, depending. This is because this game was going to be released in parts, but part 2 never came for the longest time untill some time in 2015, 5 years after the initial release. Aparantly there was some legal dispute. Either way, the amount of gameplay for 2 bucks during a sale is a good buy, and there is some replay value. As of writing this, I don't know what episode 2 brings to the table, but I'm sure it's more or less the same thing, just more of it.","June 20, 2015","true","5.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Not to mention that she just seems to be having so much fun with everything that she and all the other characters play off of each other nicely and make it enjoyable to both fight and watch cutscenes.\n\nThe combat is simplistic, mash the attack button and jump around like a kangaroo. Congrats, you've beaten most of the enemies in the game. There's an interesting mechanic where you can do the aerial wall grab move against certain vulnerable targets for an instant kill with an extra cash reward, but sometimes a move will leave an enemy vulnerable and sometimes the same move won't, so it can be really frustrating when someone blocks all your attacks and won't light up for the finish move. Also, the wall grab prefers to grab walls and ceilings rather than enemies, so if you jump up and try to insta-kill an enemy in a room with a low ceiling, you'll be gluing yourself upside down for a second in the middle of the fight. Also, the move is kind of hard to pull off with a keyboard since you need to use the q button in conjunction with wasd.\n\nThe programming is...well it's finicky. Usually the game works fine, but there are plenty of weird parts. For example, often on the instakill move, Kit or the enemy will be in the wrong location and will slowly drift into position while Kit says her taunt. There are some other weird situations like this, but there's one of these actually has the potential to break your game: for context, this is a 2D game with 3D graphics where you're supposed to run along the x-axis and jump on the y, but there are times where Kit accidentaly moves some distance in the z-direction. This can make her collide with background characters and objects which can actually make it impossible to proceed. If this happens, you had beetter hope you left an enemy alive in the current area so that they can kill you and send you back to the checkpoint. I know I'm not the only person who's had this problem as I've seen forum posts about the glitch as well.\n\nThe story has a REALLY bad problem of assuming the player has information that they have no way of learning. Nearly the entire game, I'm wandering around in random directions and eventually reach the place I was appreantly supposed to go to. I would travel right to get to the outskirts of town, Kit would get something that she needs to take to the top building in the town and instead of just backtracking a bit I would for some reason end up in a factory underground that I have to climb out of to get into the city. The entire story just keeps dropping you in random places and say "Okay, go to the Holy Island now" with no indication of which direction it's in or how far you are from it.\n\nHonestly, I recommend the game as it's a fun diversion with some really nice characters. However, the game suffers from some issues with it's programming and its narrative conveyance, so just be aware of that going in.\n\nPS: As a side note, on the first computer on which I played this game, a certain cutscene always crashed the game and made it impossible to proceed. Later, I got a new computer and tried the game again; I started a new game to remind myself about the controls, but then learned that there is only a single save slot in this game, so I had to play the whole thing again (learning that I previously had made it nearly to the end of the game). As such, I can confirm that the game doesn't have much replay value and the second playthrough was a chore. The "Skiffy" scenes where your pet uh, flying...rodent...thing goes off into the foreground or background to perform some task is completely unskippable and the little guy takes his sweet time doing them which made it really hard for me to stay immersed in the high-octane gameplay.","August 27, 2015","true","5.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'll start with the controls even tho they are rather small issues.\n\nI played with a gamepad and it worked rather smoothly other than a few occasions where I couldn't jump for some reason in a platformer this is a rather large issue but as quickly as the came they pass I could honestly blame the controller as much as the game for this but it happened enough that I began to notice it. Other than that the controls worked like a charm on a controller.\n\nLevel Design 1:\nThis is my biggest complain, upon speed running the game (90 minutes or under) I noticed that everything in the game seemed more likely to be placed there simply to slow you down rather than for a functional reason. Example being on a level where you ride a mount across roughly open fields with some ruins you have to jump or break through you come to a area where you have to dismount and turn off a set of pipes dropping sludge down into a mesh covered hole then get back on the mount and continue on. On my first play through I gave it little though but upon replaying it I found myself asking why it was even there. the pipes seemed to just come fromm the sky and pour into a hole in the ground, even accepting sky pipes pumping down to the empty field why did I have to entire this waystation turn it off (not even a minute spent in the area mind you) other than to get by it which I could easily have just stepped 2 feet infront of it and bypassed it completely. After this I noticed it more and more in other levels where they did the same thing at one point later in the same level you get off your mount to clear a obstacles and the mount literally enters the foreground and runs off so once you finish the little minute long section its waiting for you on the other side. Being that you have no pactical reason to not just skip that entire area like your mount just did.\n\nLevel Design 2:\nThere is a level where you have to jump across a sludge river (lack of a better term) by jumping from one pole to the next, the area warns you it has instadeath. Upon falling in the sludge I found myself taking damage but not insta death Which lead me to question why I'm running from the pipe dropping it that is progressing after me. Out of curiousity I jumped into it and insta died. My only real problem when this is why is it that only the falling sludge insta deaths me, its the same sludge on the ground as falling but the ground sludge is just a damage over time effect. Shouldn't both have either instadeath or dot damage?\n\nLevel Design 3:\nAs with complain number 1 tasks seem forced at more than one point you have to time laser crossings but they are along major paths that every day works and soldiers would be using which leads me to ask why they practically exist there? I know I'm probably thing too much into it but at one point there is a laser cannon on a workers path way aimed at a guard station so that if you trip a alarm you can activate it to have it cut down the gaurds exitting the guard station. Why would  the guards allow them to set that up there?\n\nLevel Design 4:\nThere are very few of these but they are annoying, megaman wall jump sections. The couple I found gave me trouble which is probably why I disliked them but once again why are they needed? You can climb on almost everything in the game stucking to extremes in some cases. In all these areas they are "metal pipes" yet earlier and later in the same level you can climb other metal pipes just fine. I'm not seeing why these few (probably under 5) even exist other than to slow you down.\n\nLevel Design 5:\nThis is a akward one because I liked it at first. The games combat can be daunting even difficult until you release its pointless. On my first play through of stage 1 I fought every enemy I explored every nook and cranny it took me almost as long to beat this first level as it did for the entire speed run (55 minutes of 90) Did I enjoy it yes and found that it seemed like it was either a super long stage or there it didn't have stages and the "check points" (nicely placed I might add) were its way of saving. Upon speed running it I found if I just leaped over the enemies and didn't take too many wrong turns I could complete the level in 6-9 minutes (almost all the levels except the 2 that can be beaten in under 3 minutes) Which leads me back to level design 1 above. The enemies and combat system and nice, although they are basically red ranged soldier, red melee soldier, white ranged soldier, and white melee soldier (with a couple exceptions). Once I realised you didn't have any real need to fight them I questioned there existance, but they do actually pertain to the plot and seem to fit the world nicely. Which leads me to ask why then didn't they just make the force fights? That you couldn't progress until you fought atleast some of the enemies. I ran into only 3-5 of these which can mostly be skipped by not setting off a alarm. The 3 bosses where fun to fight and made me appericate the work the put into them to make them so different and have special ways to beat them.\n\ntl:dr\nI know people will say i'm over thinking it or what fun is a game without obstacles in your path, things to make you go out of your way to do. I understand this and accept it its just in this game every time one of these is placed there it seems almost glaringly so just to hinder the player rather than to fuctionally exist in there world as well.\nAfter I started to notice all of this I started looking at the game completely differently. I still enjoy the game and will buy episode 2. So i'm not saying Run away and don't play this game. I actually like it.","June 22, 2015","false","7.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The story is pretty disjointed, it seems like you just go on random favors for people as you go along. I'm not usually big into story in games so I didn't get much out of it anyhow, but even watching the cutscenes didn't give me much idea of what was going on.\n\nThe gameplay is a lot of 2D platforming. There is a ton of Hex (the currency) to collect in levels, so much so that you can probably find hundreds of different secret paths that can lead you to more. This is a nice touch as you can use the hex to upgrade your character and get more costumes. It encourages exploration, and can lead to spending a lot of time in levels just messing around and finding hex. The platforming itself is generally solid, and climbing allows you to get to a lot of areas without much trouble.\n\nThe combat is one area of the game I didn't much care for. It seems that more often then not the best way to fight is to just abuse overpowered energy skills rather then fight normally. Because of this, fighting becomes quite boring, and it's mostly optional anyhow, which lead me to skip most enemies in the game (of which there are a lot). The amount of enemy spawns which seem endless in some areas seems to encourage that run away playstyle. The combat itself just doesn't have much depth, you can shield, spam attack, or spam energy skills. The boss fights are also pretty\nuninteresting.\n\nI really like the art style of the game, which seems cel-shaded. The character are animated well and I feel like I'm playing an older style console game seeing them interact.\n\nThe game lasted me about 3 hours but it would take much more time to collect everything in the levels, so if you're a completionist you can definitely get your moneys worth. I guess the game is somewhat episodic because it ends without any type of real finish to the story, and there is a Part 2 DLC. This might be something to keep in mind if you want the complete story.\n\nI did enjoy the game, but it could do with some improvements. I'm not sure if I'll go for the DLC at this point, but I might consider it in the future.\n\n7.2/10","July 3, 2015","true","3.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This happened multiple times, and is an extremely bizarre thing that I had to go into Task Manager to end.\n\nA buggy, glitchy mess that somehow is still somewhat enjoyable through the suffering. The gameplay is very much a hack n slash. Victory is gained through the constant mashing of the two attack buttons and jumping around a lot. Enemies ragdoll around and the art design makes great use of the 2.5D style here, letting enemies come in from different plains of view and adding a great set of backdrops and visuals to an otherwise bland experience. The platforming is a bit wonky and prone to some bizarre physics, but was never too offensive and more than capable of moving you through the variety of areas, but don't even bother doing some of the bonus stuff; there were plenty of times that my pursuit for the more difficult unloaded the normal levels and led to me falling through the world multiple times; inexcusible for a game about all those hidden secrets.\n\nCombat is also somehow a mess, even though it is quite truly just two different buttons to mash.

Hitting guys far away usually takes them out within a hit or two, but if you get up close they deflect your attacks in some sort of arcane counter system, stun lock you, and kick you repeatedly. You learn quickly to not do close attacks. Like most aspects of this game, combat can also be fairly glitchy, often with enemies falling in the floor but still being able to attack making them virtually invincible. Thankfully, fodder is fodder, but in the decent amount of time I put into it, all I encountered was fodder.\n\nThe game does change it up a bit with the scenarios, although some can go on for far too long. Where the real redemption and where the over all worth is would be in the excellent animation that occurs in the cutscene. It's clearly all in engine, but whomever was in charge of doing all the lipsynching and animation overall has a lot of talent and skill. That is not to say those who put this together aren't; even at its worst the game clearly has a lot of love put into it, just not a lot of polish. Even though the story never really goes past "chase this one person to find this other person between one-liners," I still enjoyed what was there. The amount of utter brokenness I encountered within my few hours of playing are fairly unexcusable, but at the same time I'm glad this game has been successful. The second episode has been out for some time now and I hear it's a better over all experience, so it's good to hear that they're doing well and that they are so open with their audience.\n\nAll the same, Blade Kitten fails to hold on to the initial fun the first few minutes offers and offers little variation throughout its short campaign. While successful overall in its ambition, the amount of gamebreaking bugs and bland gameplay ruins my overall feeling for it. This game definitely has an audience, but it's not one I can recommend in good concscience, and makes me wish once again there was a "maybe" button. Worth getting in a bundle or sale to find out how you feel about it yourself, as I am clearly in the minority.","November 28, 2015","false","19.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Fully voice acted, fairly good platformer controls. Give you flexibility to play it old school on a controller or do several keyboard+mouse  styles. Plot is... kinda disjointed, but evocative enough, especially with the voice acting.\n\nCONS: It's a little wonky getting used to having your weapon float and learning how to time your attacks so your blade is actually available to launch another attack. Wall climbing is somewhat touchy and more than once I got stuck in a slide or to a wall.  Never permanent, but it happened enough that it makes some of the rapid movement and combat sections somewhat annoying.  Short. Two hours in I had completed more than half of the game.\n\nMIXED FEELINGS: Some replayablility to find all the hidden collectibles, but it's no Metroid-vania. You don't revisit areas with new options, you just revisit them to find what you missed.  Despite the tooltips scattered around through the first few levels, They still leave some things out. Go into the options menu and read the manual first, as it also gives you some important context.\n\nOverall, I definitely recomend it. It's low cost and it's a fun platformer for the price.

Was it in one of the bundles I bought? Or did I buy it specifically because of the name (yes, I am that easy)? I have no idea. But no matter how I got the game, I'm glad I did.\n\nWhile the story is quite simple (and not all that interesting, to be honest), the game has a lot of charm. The quirky protagonist can be funny at times, the levels are visually interesting and just plain pretty and the movement, ooh the movement.\n\nI really like when a protagonist can move easily through levels and doesn't get stumped by the smallest walls or drops. ("Oh no, a hedge, I can't possibly LIFT MY LEG OVER IT, can I?") Blade Kitten is right up my alley. Kitty moves swiftly and with ease, climbing sheer clifs and overhangs like it's just a stretching excercise. The movement feels really fluid and pleasant. It's a joy to play.\n\nI have noticed that some reviewers found it difficult to do precise platform-to-platform jumps and complained that the movement is perhaps "too fluid". I think that missing some jumps in a platformer game is to be expected ;) I guess it comes down to personal preferences, but it needs to be said that even when you do miss a jump for whatever reason, it's never fatal. You can easily climb back up and try again. This happened to me a few times but it never felt like a chore.\n\nOn the contrary, I felt such joy playing this game. It's just well-designed and well-made game. It throws new things and toys your way very often, so it always stays fresh. Even Kitty herself can be "customised" by buying new costumes. The pacing reminds me of the good old Prehistoric 2. When you got bored with running around and smacking dinosaurs, the game gave you a kite to fly for a whole level or so, which completely changed the dynamic. Blade Kitten's design works similarly and as a consequence never feels dull.\n\nOne small beef I have with the game is that in later levels it's very easy to get stun-locked between multiple enemies. Kitty, attacked from both sides, sometimes can't escape the onslaught, as there's no one-second-immortality-after-being-hit as in other platformers.\n\nOne larger beef I have with the game is that it essentially ends nowhere and prompts you to buy Episode 2. I had no idea that what I have is a story-wise incomplete game. It was a bit of an unpleasant surprise to find out just when the story got a bit more interesting. I don't know the reasoning behind the episodic format. Usually, tactics like these make me feel ripped off as a customer. Still, the game on the whole was a joy to play (and both episodes are quite cheap, anyways), so this time, there are no hard feelings.\n\nThis is the only platformer game I have played end-to-end in just about fifteen years. Because it's just good.","January 20","true","5.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The music is on loop, the fighting system is very slow paced (eg. you're stunned whenever you get little damage, with no invincible episode, so if you have 3 enemies around you it's bye bye) and the levels seem unnecessary long and complex.\n\nReally would've liked this game :c","January 18","false","9.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The way her blade follows her around and you can command it to either slice and dice or throw it at bad guys is pretty cool too. I have been on the fence about this game for years now.

When you're climbing down angled surfaces you'll sometimes slide and that animation will keep playing which sometimes gets you stuck. My only real problem is the difficulty hike on bosses. The rest of the game will be fine but then bosses are just in your face wrecking your sh*t.

I finished it in 14 hours but I have quite a lot left to go back and find.\n\nI love the characters (have not read the comics but I now intend to), the light-hearted humor that doesn't destroy the parts that were more dramatic, the music, the vaguely nostalgic feel of a late 90's style platformer. I liked being able to  jump and wall-climb pretty much anywhere, making the levels a nice open map. it sort of reminded me of Strider but with cute catgirls, and *everything* is better with cute catgirls! making the collectables a currency for upgrades and vanity items was a good choice.\n\nI did encounter a couple of bugs: a cut scene failed to trigger for me, making me have to restart a section, and I also managed to fall through the world. the controls could be awkward at times, a sequence of buttons refusing to activate because I got the timing a split second off, or me not being able to tell the difference between traversable and non-traversable territory.  the final boss with its incredibly fiddly mechanic that didn't trigger half the time was a pain in the ♥♥♥, especially as it kept suddenly refusing to attack me, making it hard to bait. these bugs don't make it unplayable, just a bit irritating at times, and I think the good parts make up for it, especially as the game is cheap and constantly in sales.\n","May 16","true","15.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
