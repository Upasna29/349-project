The graphics are also quite well done, allowing a 3D pan of the playfield with the right click button.  Both the Steam Overlay and widescreen modes are supported.  The only criticism I have is the somewhat bizzare occasional splash screens that dole out life advice.  Seriously, the game tries to be your therapist or at least comes across as a political activist.  That minor gripe aside, I found myself quickly engaged by this title and a little hard to put down.  For casual puzzle gamers, Ziro is an excellent option.","July 22, 2012","true","0.8"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","10","12","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/smokindan/recommended/33660/","smokindan","Dan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/smokindan/","439 products in account","A pretty good puzzle game. It's all math based with you eliminating dice by putting them next to each other and combining them. It's a pretty straight puzzler in that there's only really one way to solve each puzzle but there's enough flexibility there to alleviate too much frustration.\n\nPlenty of content but it's all gated which is a little annoying i.e. you must solve each puzzle before you reach the next. No skipping puzzles - nothing. That means you can get really stuck which is where I am at. No puzzle game should stop you dead in your tracks. It should have a learning curve introducing new mechanics along the way and then applying them but there shouldn't be huge leaps and, if there is, then it should provide you with some out to keep progressing.\n\nAny worth it for a few dollars if you're a puzzle fan. Check out some videos if this makes no sense at all.","April 6, 2011","true","4.7"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","8","9","0","0"

YOU GOT IT! Is a very ingenious game where, in each level, you find a board with some dices that you have to clean to pass the stage basically. You make disappear the dices adding two with the each number on it, elseway they would add or subtract one each other. During the first 20 stages will appear few tutorial windows which explain you how to play and what some special dices do. There are a lot of special dices and the game counts more than 300 levels, so don't think you will waste your money for a game that last just few hours! In the end, if you like puzzles you must try this game and even if you don't, you should give it a try because is cheap and worth a lot: a double reason to help the indie market. ;-)","September 12, 2013","true","61.7"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","67","8","12","4","0"

Slide some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ numbers around and do some math as well. It's good, and gets very difficult when you have to cope with multiple possibilities and combinations that might be correct -- but might not.\n\nWho knows, maybe you'll even learn how to conserve energy by "cooking your own roast rather than driving to the pub on Sundays" as one of the game's helpful tips suggests. But I doubt it.","December 29, 2012","true","1.2"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","6","9","0","0"

It is uninspired in it's design but it is in its core a simple puzzle game with simple mechanics. It just left  a sour feeling in me for the 41 minutes that I played it. I really tried to enjoy it but I couldn't go beyond what I had played. Buy it during a sale if you want to try but persoanlly, there are more inspiring puzzle games than this one.

So, it's really hard for me to have fun with this title. Ziro is based around the mechanic of using arithmetic to calculate ahead of moves if a series of die will match. If you like these kinds of challenging puzzles, you'll really enjoy this game. It's just not for me.","April 29","false","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
