You will research new weapons, armor and even technologies such as genetic engineering and mech warrior (half man, half machine ... although more like 5% man 95% machine). You will have to capture and interogate the aliens, perform autopsies, and try to understand why the Aliens are here, and how you can stop them.\n\nThe visuals are great, although they are a little over the top. You can field warriors clad in pink with bright blue big hair, or you can choose dark comoflaged spec ops type soldiers. It is up to you and has no effect on the game other than to meet your own preferences. You can name you soldiers to make it more personal, and more dramatic when they die.\n\nAll round this is a fun game, and with DLC such as the Enemy Within and mods such as Long War this game has a lot of replay value, and potentially could be something you sink hundreds of hours into.","January 1, 2015","true","250.4"," 299 of 313 people (96%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","96","299","313","11","2"

About Enemy Within, and the chances it brought. About the mod Long War and how it turns this great game into an epic marathon.\nBut you don't want to hear that. You want to know if this particular game is worth your money and your time.\n\nIn short: It is.\n\nThis is game about adaptation. About turning the weapons and technologies of the invaders against them, about choosing where to pool your limited resources, or where to send your troopers to fight, knowing some may not return.\nAnd boy, does it hurt when your beloved sniper, the one you've been watching over from the start, that guy that could always be counted to nail a crit at extreme distances. He has just died because you send your fire team ahead and he was left behind to offer support... until a flanking alien killed him in cold blood. That's X-COM. Those memorable moments that happen amidst the familiar landscapes. You'll also offer silent prayer to that unfortunate civilian that had to die so that you could hit that alien cluster arround him with a rocket.\n\nIn terms of crunch, the tactical aspect is very solid. A large part of the battlefield can be brought down, and so can your cover, making each battle less about hunkering down and dealing and taken fire and more about manuevering. A flanking, agile soldier can become just as deadly as the one hunkered down behind a wall with the giant machine gun.\n\nA very enjoyable game, with engaging mechanics and a smart AI that makes for very emotional, un-scripted moments.","November 18, 2015","true","607.6"," 233 of 240 people (97%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","97","233","240","14","1"

Naturally this made it quite difficult to satisfy the fans of the original as well as to attract new players in equal parts.\n\nWhat Firaxis did well, was the graphical style and presentation, XCOM offers the style of the first UFO games, while bringing it in the new era. Nothing extraordinaire for sure, but fitting graphics with the one or other really nice possibility to take a screenshot or enjoy the headshot with which your sniper eliminates this pesky alien.\n\nRegarding the gameplay they tried to keep the balance between streamlining and complexity.\n\nThe maps are handmade, offering some nice details and mostly destroyable enviroment, but since the random element is gone, they keep on repeating themselves after some playtime.\n\nThe same can be said for the progression of the game itself.. your soldiers are basically divided into classes, which have fixed perk trees to choose from on level up. Without the added options of "Second wave" and the additional possibilities from "Enemy within" to enhance your soldiers with mech or gene modifications, this brings up a similiar problem to the maps, the soldiers are very similiar to each other. As mentioned the add-on options change this in a positive way, beside the modifications you can for example enable that each soldier has different starting stats.\nStill this does not reach the complexity of the original X-Com soldiers, but helps the diversity significally.\n\nAs for the base management and battles themselves.. once again it is the mix of old and new. The Action points of the old soldiers are gone, now each soldier has two actions per turn (with the right perks, it can be way more though) one for moving, the other for shooting. Again perks as well as equipment can change the possibilities of a soldiers actions.\nThis system together with an intelligent cover system works quite well and makes for interesting battles.\nThe base has fixed fields, which you have to fill during the game. Also with the add-on the possibility of the enemy invading your base returns, though as a scripted event.\n\n\nWhat gripes i have with the game is, that for example it forces you to go a certain way in science and engineering, besides the story elements themselves. If you don´t rush satellites for most of the states you have a hard time to survive. Same with the interceptors. A bit more freedom and variety would be helpful, especially for a game with such a possible long time motivation. "Enemy within" helps in this respect, but cannot eliminate the weaknesses in full.\n\nNevertheless they did quite a good job, bringing the alien hunt to the modern age.\nSo if you like strategy, grab this one :)","November 26, 2013","true","40.4"," 253 of 291 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","253","291","0","6"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sickbadger/recommended/200510/","sickbadger","fightoffyourdemons","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sickbadger/","187 products in account","This is for EU and Enemy Within.\n\nThis game is not for the light hearted. You will lose. You will fail miserably. You will have a lot of fun.\n\nThis Sisyphean experience starts off easy enough. Couple of greys, a world moderately in danger. Then the panic strikes, then the world starts asking more of XCOM, then somewhere along the lines you lose 3 men in a Muton ambush, or a squad wipes on a crucial civilian extraction. Then there's the once in a lifetime chance shotgun blast across the map that kills the Sectopod, the single Archangel sniper spitting death from on high like some blessed avenger with a plasma lance cutting a swath through the heathen hordes of aliens. "That's XCOM, baby" is the common phrase other players will use. The emotional rollercoaster you ride through this game is a unique experience, should you buy into it. (The canned ending, personally, is the worst, but your personal experience each playthrough is unique and randomly generated. Your mileage may vary)\n\nThe turn based gameplay is one of the best and worst parts of the game. There's a lot of unskippable cutscenes and dealing with the "aggro" animation when you run into a mob(s) is rather annoying. On the flip side, the tactical control is intuitive and you'll find yourself slowly starting to game the game (lol) and thinking imaginatively. XCOM wants you to do this, I think. Its designed to be unrelenting but it has chinks in its armor. On the 'backside', building your fortress of badassery is either a mundane task or a nailbiting terror fest. Every click could spell disaster for your budget or you may find yourself spamming "scan for threats" for ages at a time. It plays with you, which is only fair since you play with it.\n\nEW expands greatly on EU's strengths. There's a few setpiece missions that do intend to wipe your team, raising the stakes and discouraging spamming a single A team for every mission. The new Mechs and other units will test your Commanding skills and livened up the "meta", diversifying how you respond to missions and consquences. Rocket punching (a la Pacific Rim or Big O) a berzerker is one of the best video game moments I've ever had. The EXALT half of the game is interesting, but a distraction at best (you can clear these segments rather early in a playthrough) and the extent of their treachery wasn't really felt. The story of the "furies" is a pretty forgettable story itself, but the boost to your psi units is worth the risk.\n\nAll in all, the idea that each playthrough will have its different moments outside of the canned story is a pretty cool and integral part to the XCOM experience. While new "second wave" options will spice up that even further, it could use a sandbox mode or a 'infinte wave' mode as you can stumble through the game or carefully plan every step and still get to a weird, grindy moment in playthroughs. I'd definitely try ironman mode for later playthroughs or things like "training roulette" to let the RNG throw everything its got at you.\n\nGood luck, and happy hunting, Commander.\n","December 19, 2013","true","162.4"," 162 of 184 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","162","184","0","1"

I love turn based games and this takes strategy to the fullest. In this game it is man vs. alien and we are fighting back to remove the aliens. You control a squad of soldiers that you move and tell them who to attack, defend, or to do overwatch to attack moving enemies. There are four types of soldiers you can get randomly when they level up and each will gain rank and you choose from 1 or 2 abilities when they do. If your soldiers die you have a chance to save them by healing them before they die but if they die they are gone forever. You also have the build up your forces by researching technology and spending resources to buy new technologies, weapons, and buildings.\n\nThis is a highly addictive game which can be pretty difficult if you don't cheat (save often and reload over and over again to get the best results). An interesting thing about XCom is it saves its random number generator so that means if you load a game and do the same actions over again you will get the same results but if you do things in a different order you can get different results (the chances to hit will be the same but if one soldier is more likely to hit, he might hit an enemy when another would miss).\n\nThe only thing I didn't like about this game is it seems to be very short to finish one playthrough but you could always play again with a higher difficulty or it also comes with Second Wave which lets you chance certain settings in the game. I would highly recommend if you like turn based strategy games.","August 12, 2014","true","5.3"," 156 of 176 people (89%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","89","156","176","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/deathbomb1/recommended/200510/","deathbomb1","Dirk Dickbutt","http://steamcommunity.com/id/deathbomb1/","389 products in account","Xcom is pretty tragic, I guess.\n\nYou play as a commander for Xcom, an organization with a fatality in the thousands. Your duty is to stop dirty alien ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s from descending from that place where baby Jesus may or may not live, and killing everyone you've ever known and love. Don't worry, everyone you know and love will still die, only at a slower rate. With the world's leaders at your back, you recruit soldiers, engineers, and scientists from the greatest bunch of cowards planet earth can provide.\n\nAfter you set up your base, you begin researching, purchasing, and building, using satellites to watch the skies for the spooky aliens. When one of those grey ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s finally decides to show it's big dumb stinky head, you shoot down it's stupid looking space craft and send your friends to die horrible, brutal deaths.\n\nOh yeah, and you can customize the name's and appearances of all your Xcom operatives, so you get super attached to them right before a horrible spider creature disembowls the guy and lays eggs in his scrotum. I will never forget you Stinky Poo Poo Marine. But it only goes downhill from there when you realize that the crotch eggs turned your bff into a zombie which will then explode into a crotch alien that in turn can turn the rest of your squad into angry crotch aliens. I will never forget you, Stinky Poo Poo Squad.\n\nCombat with the little green men is handled turn based, and unlike it's predecessor games, you actually have a chance to bring someone home alive instead of drowning your enemies in corpses. You take turns moving your units around cover to take pot shots or flank the aliens in small scale squad combat. And while the enemy brings powers and weapons far beyond your own, you have your own advantages as well such as actually being able to aim or your soldier panicking and actually shooting at the enemy that made him panic.\n\nIt's not all hopeless, though. In between the murders of your best friends and the pants wetting terror that your operatives endure, things slowly begin to go your way. The more aliens you wipe out, the more space stuff you pick up, the more space stuff you pick up the more stuff you can research. But the end of the game, after all the aliens have been sliced open and eaten, I mean researched, and all of the space guns have been carefully looked at. The operatives lucky enough not to get their skulls punched out the back of their heads gained enough new equipment and experience to go head to head with even the toughest alien.\nSectoids become a nuisance at best, Muton's who were once like mini boss fights become the standard infantry you have to contend with, and all the big scary robots that the aliens used to have romantic evenings with your operatives sphincters are completely over come by being covered in a large angry blanket of plasma fire. It's quite the empowering experience to be the ones doing the alien ♥♥♥♥ pushing instead of the other way around.\n\nThe expansion pack goes even further beyond, adding a human enemy faction that likes to take your lasers in the face the same way fat kids like to eat cake,  as well as giving you the opportunity to make both battle jedi and giant robot men that make you feel safe in their big strong arms.\n\nBut should you play X-Com Enemy Unknown/Enemy Within?\nYes, you should. While one can argue that it's nowhere near as expansive or in depth as the original series, it offers a newer and more accessible way to enter a fairly old and reveared series. It's a gateway drug into the older and more demanding games. Just don't go naming your soldiers after your high school crush if you don't want to see her murdered and eaten by crab spiders.\n\nI give DBomb: Adversary confused/ Combatant Inside, Seven old timey UFO movies out a possible four War of the World remakes.\n\nI saw the face of god and it was weeping.\n\nOh yeah, the curator.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/Dickbuttexperience#curation\nWe're nearing 200 followers now and 100 members in the steam group.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/anthonyedwardstark/recommended/200510/","anthonyedwardstark","CapRichard","http://steamcommunity.com/id/anthonyedwardstark/","546 products in account","XCOM: Enemy Unknown is the crown jewel of modern designed turn based tactical games.\nHere you will not find a true sequel to X-COM, but you will find a good game nonetheless, even if it's in a totally different league. This is more like an evolution of a Final Fantasy Tactics, rather than UFO.\nThe tactical gameplay and the strategic layer are interlinked and form a choesive whole. The more mission you win, the more goods you will bring home and use to beef up your squad, until you win against the alien menace. The Enemy Within Expansion adds more stuff and goodies to research and to spend your resources on, making for a more varied gameplay and providing the player with more choices to make, both in the strategic layer and in the tactical layer.\nThe permadeath that permeates the whole experience, makes this a game that punish you for bad decisions, from start to finish. It's higly reccomended to play this in 'Iron Man' mode, which is a mode where manual saving is not possible and the game autosaves after each action, increasing a lot the tension.\nThe game also offers nice replayability options, thanks to possible different squad layouts, a big numebr of maps and the 'second wave options', modifiers that change the behaviour of many of the game mechanics, avalaible for a second, third and more runs.\nThe game suffers from an inverse difficulty curve, where the lategame is much easier than your early game, and the Enemy Within expansion makes this worse. The descreased difficulty and teh lack of major events make the late game a bit of a slog.\nI suggest playing EW on a higher difficulty than your average EU playthrough to compensate. The game also has some bugs here and there, even if in EW and with the latest patch, their number should be reduced.\nAll things being said, this game is a must buy for gamers looking for a bit of turn based combat, which is so rare to find nowdays.","November 25, 2013","true","147.7"," 162 of 187 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","162","187","0","1"

See Conclusion\nNOTE 1: This review will include an XCOM: Enemy Within expansion review.\n\nNOTE 2:I'm reposting some of my old reviews because I adopted an easier to read format (and because for some reason I can't edit my old reviews)\n\nINTRODUCTION:XCOM: Enemy Unknown is an isometric turn-based strategy game and a remake, or rather, reimagining of the classic UFO and X-COM games.  The 2012 version aims to bring back the turn-based genre into the mainstream market by introducing the series to modern day graphics, mechanics, and a streamlined and revamped gameplay but still maintaining its tactical stratigic depth.\n\nThe player assumes the role of the XCOM Commander who is tasked to lead an elite team of soldiers, scientists and engineers from all across the globe in an effort to thwart a massive alien invasion.  You are Earth's first and last line of defense.\n\nPROS:XCOM: Enemy Unknown (BASE GAME)\n+ High Replayability with multiple interchanging missions.\n+ Very challenging difficulty.\n+ Streamlined Gameplay Mechanic: This remake of the series streamlined the gameplay in a way that it is easier to learn but very difficult to master.\n+ Good voice acting and cut scenes.\n+ Tense and action-packed gameplay.\n+ Customization options for your base, air force and soldiers.\n+ Good enemy variety which forces players to adapt.\n+ Well Optimized for the PC.\n\nXCOM: Enemy Within (EXPANSION)\n+ New 'Mechtrooper' Class is fun to play and a great addition to the roster of soldiers.\n+ New 'Meld' resource forces players on a more aggressive and fast-paced play style.\n+ New 'Soldier Augmentations' using the Meld substance will provide soldiers with alien-like abilities which is fun to use.\n+ Localized Voices: The expansion now gives the option to use the localized version of the game and make their soldiers speak in their native tongue (not all countries though).\n+ New missions such as Infiltration with Extraction Missions and Base Defense.\n+ XCOM: Long War Mod is available and easy to install to give the game a fresh new life.\n\nCONS:- Bugs: Updated, patched plus an expansion, but still having some of the day one bugs lingering around.\n- Graphic and Camera glitches.\n- No Co-op challenges or missions.\n- Not enough special missions.\n- Interceptor Jets have limited upgrades and customization (can't even change the name of the pilot).\n- Late game is a bit too easy and may become boring when everyone in your team is fully upgraded.\n- No mid-battle or mid-mission inventory change.\n- Some maps repeat if your campaign drags on too long (ex. If you enable the Second Wave 'Marathon' Option).\n\nCONCLUSION:GREAT GAME and HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.  X-COM: Enemy Unknown / Within, is an excellent remake with a revamped game mechanic that is easy to learn yet hard to master.  It has updated graphics and visuals that bring the world alive.  The combat is tense and action-packed that keeps you at the edge of your seat. Plus, it has lots of missions that have good variety which provides a very challenging difficulty.  And above all, it provides a very fun experience for both fans of the series and new players alike.\n\nWell worth its full price. I never had the pleasure of playing the original X-COM games and I know that some of the hardcore fans might have been put off by the streamlining of the series.  As for me however, the 2012 remake is a game that delivered one of my best experience on any turn-based strategy game in a long time.\n\nIf you're looking for the Classic X-COM experience, check out Xenonauts:\n\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/223830/","February 28, 2015","true","616.4"," 150 of 173 people (87%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","87","150","173","6","16"

His best friends, Grace and Matt, tagged along. Each of them were promoted to Squaddie during their first missions, and they were given their combat roles. Jordan became an Assault trooper, Matt Support, and Grace Heavy.\n\nMatt gave his life to save Jordan in a botched mission. Grace spent weeks recovering from her wounds.\n\nJordan was given the nickname "Spitfire" after his next mission. The loss of his friend turned him into a hardened killing machine. The commander recognized that, and Jordan began receiving promotions and being given experimental weapons and armor.\n\nJordan picked up a few more friends on the battlefield. He swore not to let any more good men die. But it wasn't long before the aliens took another one of his companions. Beatriz, a Brazilian medic, was gunned down right in front of Jordan. He and Grace made the aliens pay with their lives.\n\nAfter that Jordan was the spearhead of every operation. The commander sent him on every mission. And Jordan never failed. His fellow soldiers relied on and supported his unorthodox brute force tactics.\n\nEventually Jordan and his friends were promoted to the highest combat rank of XCOM: Colonel. They became a cohesive unit on the battlefield. The researchers made sure they were equipped with the most advanced tech available. Jordan was even hand picked by the commander for a special project. He was the only one in XCOM that completed the training.\n\n*Spoilers censored*\nWhen the time came to take the fight to the aliens, Jordan did not hesitate. He led his team to the enemy (spoiler). But in the end, the aliens' psionic powers turned half of the squad against itself. The cohesion was lost, and Jordan called for covering fire from the team sniper, Boone. Boone was a crackshot, perhaps a little too good. His bullet went straight through the (spoiler)'s skull, severing the link between it and the squad. Jordan's heart sank, however, when Grace slumped to the floor. The experience shattered her mind, killing her instantly. He called to the squad's medic, Miracle, but for nothing. Miracle had also died from the experience. Two more of his friends, dead in an instant. What if he could have disabled the alien, or somehow severed its link without harming his friends? He didn't know, and it didn't matter. As the rest of the squad began to evacuate, he turned toward the (spoiler). He knew what he had to do. Boone and Domingo were the only ones to make it home that day. They had won, but at what cost?\n\nRest in peace, my friends.\nMayara (Heavy)\nMatt (Support - Medic)\nBeatriz (Support -Medic)\nBenjamin (Rookie)\nGrace (Heavy)\nMiracle (Support - Medic)\nJordan (Assault, Psionic Operative)\n\n\n\nAll of these characters, along with a few others, were named after my friends. I cared about them, I panicked when they were in danger and I was heartbroken to see them killed. Leaving the bodies behind to evac the surviving soldiers when things went south was not easy. This was the one of the most emotional experiences I've ever had in a game (Note: I haven't played Spec Ops: The Line.) and I loved it. The fact that it didn't have to come from scripted events and cutscenes made it even better.\n\nI've only played through the game once at this point, but I certainly plan to run through it a few more times. This game is worth its current full price, but if you can catch it while it's on sale there is no reason to pass this up.\n\n10/10 would tell my rl friend that he died in my game again.","June 17, 2015","true","23.7"," 114 of 129 people (88%) found this review helpful 52 people found this review funny","88","114","129","52","2"

You play as the XCOM commander and an enormous weight sits in your shoulders since no decision is easy when you are at war.  Decisions will be made right from the very first time you play the game weather on choosing some locations above others, depending on what advantages each brings to the table as well what technologies you want to focus first. Strategy is key in both combat and the XCOM facility. It’s not about simply erasing any possible threat but also trying to capture some species for further analysis and study as well to bring more researches that can improve your armory and fleet giving you a better chance at surviving. It is also wise to build a squad in different ways, using different skills in the battle so you can be ready for the most scenarios the game will throw at you.\n\nIf you let immerse yourself during the brief introduction to the Story you will get a sense of constant panic and terror due to the global alien invasion showing no mercy killing everyone, civilians and soldiers. While the strength of XCOM is the pure strategy gameplay there will be plenty of time for you to get a raw sense of fear, as well for most of your untrained soldiers since panic will also be part of the battle and will influence their behavior during critical times.\n\nPaying and attention and playing the Tutorial will be very useful in the game but later on you will learn from your own trial & error experiences. While some strategies can work based on some luck, other will require for you to grab every single chance and make every single bullet/turn counts. Difficulty can be a bit harsh if you are not used to genre but believe me, it’s worth learning the basic stuff. I would say that Easy difficulty felt like Normal and Normal sometimes felt like Hard (and so on). If you are a truly adventurer and fearless commander, higher difficulties will put your patience, skills and strategy to the test during every single turn.\n\nThe soundtrack is minimal since it’s not a big focus on this game but I felt quite excited each time I was in my paramilitary facility and I became aware of a new threat. The music right when you choose which member will fill your squad to fight in battle give you a decent sentiment of anxiety making you eager to find the next battle location, type of terrain, possibility of new threats and so on.\n\nIn the end, XCOM: Enemy Unknown proved to be a time sink, but a good one, there’s no doubt. There is plenty of options for you to make the game adjustable according to your difficulty preferences and there’s a decent amount of content while pushing for new technologies, new weapons, new armor and suits and new ways to fight the enemy. Make your choices wisely, time is short, resources are limited and remember, you can’t save everyone so expect losses in the battlefield without forgetting to extract wisdom from each battle, won or lost.","October 17, 2014","true","35.2"," 98 of 115 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","98","115","0","5"

XCOM: EU is a very tight, lean and challenging game. I commend Firaxis on an excellent difficulty selection where "Easy" really allows for a pretty casual game once you figured out the basics and where a multitude of options and modifiers (Second Wave) allow you to tighten the screw as much as you like.\n\nCombat is tense and tactical, easy to learn but challenging to master. The action cam makes some cool "cutscenes" out of your movements. And the occasional directional hint towards the nearest enemies helps reducing downtime on larger maps.\n\nIf you are willing to accept a few simplification over a more exact and detailed simulation you'll be pleased by an elegant design, a great atmosphere and an awesome expansion once you had you fill of the basegame.","November 9, 2014","true","203.9"," 119 of 147 people (81%) found this review helpful 30 people found this review funny","81","119","147","30","2"

A great games this is.\n\nXCOM: Enemy Unknown is about an alien invasion, well not really a full scale invasion, not yet, but it's an invasion. You are XCOM, an organization that responsible for any threat regarding to allien or anything that comes from outer space. It's quite addictive like Civilization games.\n\nXCOM: Enemy Unknown gameplay is so addictive, build up your base, train and promote your soldiers, research technology based on captured allien tech on the field, build interceptors to take down incoming UFO's, stopping alien assault and abduction of humans, assault alien UFO crash site, it never stops. Soldiers can be customized with armors, better rifles or shotguns, give them some laser weapons and they look like a Stormtroopers. There's also a time when your base will be attacked by the X-Rays, it's what they called the alien there since they don't really know what those aliens are, so many creatures. So much to do.\n\nXCOM: Enemy Unknown, for a strategy games, it has quite great graphics and effects, better detailed and all. Performance are perfectly great, no issues whatsoever.\n\nIf only modding is officially supported, nevertheless I recommend XCOM: Enemy Unknown.\n\nRating 9/10","November 7, 2015","true","102.6"," 75 of 83 people (90%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","90","75","83","9","2"

I'm not going to include that in the review because I'm planning to write a separate review for it. This review will only be about the BASE GAME + ALL DLC.\n\nAlso, I have not played the original XCOM games (shame on me, I know) so I won't be making any comparisons to those.\n\nTL;DRFor the people that don't like reading walls of texts.\n\nWHAT IT IS:\nA Tactical Turn-Based Strategy Game where you're the Commander of an organization formed by the Council of Nations called the XCOM. You are tasked with defending the planet from an alien invasion by sending your squad around the world in order to fight the aliens.\n\nGENERAL RECOMMENDATION:\nYES. I highly recommend this game.\n\nRECOMMENDED FOR:	Those looking for a hardcore tactical turn-based strategy game. Make no mistake about it: XCOM EU, even on lower difficulties, is HARD.\nThose looking for a game that features aliens.\nThose looking for a game that would test their patience. In a good way.\nThose looking for a game with a ton of replayability. It's a great time sink!\nNOT RECOMMENDED FOR:	Those looking for a casual experience. This game is anything but casual[i.imgur.com].\nThose who don't like strategy games in general.\nThose who don't have a lot of patience.\nThose who hate RNG.\nThose looking for an active multiplayer community. There's barely anyone on when looking for a multiplayer match nowadays.\nTHE REST OF THE REVIEWFor the people that actually like reading walls of texts.\n\nTHAT'S XCOM, BABY!\nTutorial mission. Four of your soldiers were sent in to investigate the first alien activity of the game. The game teaches the player with the basics on how to play the game. So far, so good. That is...until the game starts introducing combat.\n\nYour team gets ambushed by the aliens and your soldiers get picked off one by one. By the end of the mission, only one of your four soldiers is left alive.\n\nThe tutorial mission teaches the player a lot of basic things such as moving, flanking, and shooting. But more importantly, it teaches the player that the game is not going to show any mercy even during a tutorial mission. That it's going to be brutal. That losing some soldiers in battle is required to win the war. And this sets the tone for the entire game.\n\nXCOM is brutal, but it is also fair. It's one of those games that is easy to get into but hard to master. And it's also one of those games that punishes the player even for the smallest of mistakes. The game can get very tense and gives the player a great sense of urgency. Thus, making each victory feel very rewarding.\n\nIt's this difficulty that is actually one of the game's main selling points. And it fits perfectly for this type of game because after all, alien invasions are not something that humanity can easily prepare for.\n\nLOOKS GOOD EVEN ON LOW\nI can't talk much about the graphics because I play on a crappy laptop and I'm not really the type of person who plays games for the graphics. But all I can say is that the graphics look great even when putting all the settings to "Low". It also runs decently on low-end laptops (like the one that I'm using).\n\nYOU'LL KEEP COMING BACK FOR MORE\nThis game has a ton of replayability. Every playthrough could turn out to be different. There are four difficulties to choose from: Easy, Normal, Classic, and Impossible. There's a "Second Wave" option, which allows the player to start a game with different modifiers. And if that's not hard enough, you can try Ironman mode where the game automatically saves every move you make and you can't load any previous saves aside from the latest one.\n\nYou can also customize a couple of things in-game such as the name of your soldiers, what their nationality is, how their armor would look like, among other things.\n\nEven though a single playthrough can last for over 20 hours (on lower difficulties), there's a ton of reason to keep playing again and again.\n\nGREAT SOUND BUT GETS REPETITIVE OVER TIME\nThe music in the game is good especially during combat or when you're about to send your squad on a mission. It fits well into the setting of the game. Sadly, it does tend to be very repetitive especially after playing the game for hundreds of hours. This is understandable because music wasn't really a big focus of the game. It can also be easily remedied by just playing your own music in the background.\n\nBUGS\nThere are a couple of bugs in the game. Most of which are just bugs that affect the game visually. But there are bugs that can actually turn the tide of a battle. During my entire playthrough of the game, the bugs didn't bother me that much. And I guess I'm just lucky to not have encountered any game-breaking bugs during my Ironman playthrough.\n\nCAMERA ISSUES\nThe camera and manual targeting system are very wonky. This is especially true when trying to throw a grenade or blasting an enemy with a rocket. Sometimes, I end up throwing a grenade at my own soldier by accident thanks to the wonkiness of both the camera and manual targeting system combined.\n\nRANDOMNESS\nRNG. Random Number Generation. Some people love it, some people hate it. In XCOM EU, RNG determines how successful you are in hitting an enemy. A 99% chance to hit still has that 1% chance to miss and trust me, in XCOM EU, it CAN miss.\n\nI can understand how frustrating it can be but on the upside, it does add more tension into the game knowing that as long as your chance to hit is not 100% you're most likely going to miss.\n\nCONCLUSION\nXCOM Enemy Unknown is a must-buy video game especially if you're into hard strategy games. Great gameplay and replayability combined will ensure that you'll keep coming back for more. It is in no way a perfect game, but it is still amazing nonetheless. It may not appeal to everyone, but if you're like me and this is your cup of tea, you'll love it.\n\nThis is also the base game needed to play XCOM Enemy Within which makes an already great XCOM Enemy Unknown even better. But that is another review for another time.\n\nREVIEWER'S CREDIBILITY\nThis is only my second review ever on Steam but I feel like I've played enough of the game[i.imgur.com] to be able to write this review.","March 21, 2015","true","329.1"," 66 of 72 people (92%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","92","66","72","4","3"

Frusterating. Rewarding. This is XCOM: Enemy Unknown.\n\nAnd you'll love it.\n\n\nSeriously though, developer Firaxis did an excellent job wih this game. Coming out of Civ V, this was a nice change of pace from waiting for your opponents to do something interesting (Civ V), to spliting your squad into two groups near the end of a mission, only to encounter an enemy that forces you to take a step back and regroup. One soldier may die, one may miss A LOT, and one may got shot in the face while running away. But you know what? That's the charm of this game. It requires that you change up your tactics on the spot, and use each solider's strength's to the enemy's weakness. Some enemies may be able to throw grenades, some may jump around the map, and some may be able to infect your guys into zombies (No, seriously).\n\nThe maps themselves are all excellently hand-crafted, even if they pop up again from time to time. You'll also research new techs for your engineers to build, gaining new equipment, armour, and weapons. Sometimes a UFO will pop up, requiring you to scramble a jet to take it down. Other times you'll be required to choose which country to assist, raising the panic level of another. What happens if the panic level gets too high? Well, the country will revoke its support. Lose too many? You fail the game.\n\nMission variety is also a thing in this game. You'll sometimes have to investigate alien abductions, clear out UFO crash sites, and repel terror attacks. My personal favourite is the UFO missions, but the others are just as fun. As for this games presentation, it's done wonderfully. The graphics may not be HOLY BALLS AMAZING, but they set a tone and art style that gives the game the atmosphere that hummanity is getting hammered down. The music ranges from cinematic fight music with a sci-fi flavour, all the way to creepy atmospheric trakcs. The story itself is very basic: The aliens are invading, and XCOM is formed to fight them off. The cutscenes definitely add a cinematic quality to this game that is masterfully done.\n\nAlso, don't expect this game to be for the light-hearted. You WILL fail. Your soldiers WILL die. Countries WILL reach critical panic levels. But prevail through it, and you'll find your success.\n\nIf I had to rate this game, I'd give it a 9.5/10. I forgot to mention that intercepting UFO's is extremly barebones, but either than that every other problem is extremly insignificant and shouldn't bring the game down at all. I should also mention that this game makes my laptop overheat, but that's more my fault than anything else.\n\n","October 19, 2014","true","80.4"," 63 of 73 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","63","73","0","3"

Its not just a tactical strategy, because between missions you'll be managing a secret base with easy menus. You'll get to buy equipment, assign what to research, add facilities to your base, hire new soldiers, manage the ones you have, get air power to combat UFOs, launch satellites and see how you're doing across the globe when it comes to ceasing alien panic. A failed mission isn't a game over. Without successful missions, panic will continue to rise in regions. Sometimes, you'll need to chose one of three regions to defend. Do you take on a mission in Nigeria and ignore Germany and China? On top of that, each mission has rewards they tell you up front. Japan gives $200, but Australia has a Lieutenant Sniper and Brazil offers 4 engineers. The choice is yours Commander. Each month, regions pay you based on your performance in that region. The only game over is losing most of Earth to alien forces.\n\nThe gameplay for the turn based tactical strategy is simple, yet deep. Your usual squad consists of 4 - 6 members. Each of your troops have two turns. Once all of your troops have taken a turn, then the opposing side gets a chance.  In these turns, you can move a troop, attack an enemy, reload, defend your position, overwatch and use abilities. Some actions like overwatch and reload will end that troop's turn. Move troops to cover so they don't get murdered. There is half cover and full cover. Cover can be destroyed with grenades, rockets and gunfire. Attacking enemies is easy enough, the game tells you who you can attack, what your percentage is that you'll hit them, up to how much damage and a critical hit percentage. Gold icons mean the enemy is out of cover. Each enemy has energy that you can see above them unless you off set that in options. After three or four shots with your primary weapon you can either switch to a weak pistol or reload. Overwatch allows that troop to attack an enemy if they pop out of cover during the enemy's turn. So if you have a 20% chance to hit the enemy, best to overwatch for when they move during their turn.\n\nThe abilities get based on classes and unlocked for each soldier as they rank up. When a troop has reached its first rank (squaddie), he or she earns one of four classes: sniper, heavy, support and assault. Other than abilities, it gears the soldier more toward certain weapons and tactics. Snipers use long range rifles, but need a pistol for short range. Heavies have the most powerful heavy weapons and rocket launchers, but cannot get critical hits. The rocket launcher, grenades and other things can be freely aimed so you can use them to destroy cover. Assault classes use shotguns, assault rifles and pistols. Support classes can use the same thing, but they move further on the battlefield.\n\nIts not just unlocking abilities, but for every rank you chose which of two abilities to unlock. So you can make every soldier different. I can't cover them all, but snipers unlock things like headshots that increase critical chance, a recon throwable to see more of the battlefield. Assault class has abilities such as run and gun to fire your weapon even after using two turns to run and flush that forces an enemy to run out of cover. It all adds so much variety and the choice is yours. You can customize all your troops down to their name, look, country and so on. You're not forced to micro manage them.\n\nEach unit can get equipped with armor and an extra item, such as various grenades, more armor, med kit, scope for better accuracy and an arc thrower to capture enemies alive for research. Your troops can be flat out killed in battle. Death is permanent. Sometimes you get lucky and the soldier isn't dead, but needs to get stabilized with a med kit or they'll die in three rounds. That doesn't mean they'll be back in the fight without an ability granting it. If you chose to abandon a mission, you need to get everyone back to the ship or they're lost forever. There is a memorial to show you all the lives lost.\n\nYou are in command and beyond a mission or two that teaches you, you'll be on your own with no hand holding. The game does a good enough job explaining things so you can make informed decisions from equipment stats, to research and objectives on a mission. There is a lot of freedom in this game. You can micromanage as deep as you want.\n\nThe game shines when it comes to the enemy variety and intelligence. When you first begin you face common sectoids that will laser at you, but the moment they seem insignificant, they can use metal powers to create shields around greater enemies. Thin men not only explode into poisonous gas, preventing you from killing them up close, but they also can shoot the poison to ensure they're always hurting your team. There are items to prevent poison, but its not worth it. The game amps it up to floating creatures and giant mechanized discs complete with drones that do little damage, but heal the robots. Later on, there are much stronger soldiers that intimidate, which can cause your own troops to become uncontrolled with fear if their will power stat isn't high enough. Other variations continue to charge at whomever shoots them. There are even enemies that will mind control your own troops into fighting for them. If that wasn't bad enough there are fast moving aliens that cause people to become difficult to kill zombies. The enemies will try to flank you and if you can't find any to kill your squad will hear them make noises in directions to bait you over to them.\n\nThe maps are well put together. No matter if you're in a giant alien mothership or in the middle of the woods next to a book store. Everything is credible, both the grandiose and the mundane. The missions have compelling objectives that sometimes tell a story. Its more than just kill em all, its save people to prevent them from getting turned into zombies. Rescue a diplomat and get him back to your ship safe.\n\nOutside of combat, there is the day to day operations of your base. You can have your crew research weapons, do alien autopsies, sift through futuristic technologies in order to unlock new gear and weapons. The engineers will construct the weapons, ships, armor and equipment. Everything not only costs money but parts you find from missions. You can even build new facilities, things like laboratories grant you more scientists to research faster.  There are satellite relays to increase the satellite capacity you can have in orbit. All these things need power and there are a variety of generates to construct. You have a limited amount of space at your underground compound, so make good use of it. Putting two similar facilities next to each other gives them a bonus.\n\nWith satellites operational, they'll detect UFOs and you send out continental aircraft to shoot them down. Each continent can have up to four jets and you can equip their armament. Not just that, but to make combat more engaging for you watching, there are items you can buy and use to help your jet win the fight. You can also break off from battle to keep your jet from getting obliterated if it gets too bad.\n\nAll the research, satellites getting launched and facilities getting made isn't done in a day. That's where you wait. Day by day, you scan for activity. Sometimes there is a string of days with no contact. Other days there are UFOs, missions, crash landings and the council sends you on missions. It really sinks you into a world all its own. There are a few different personalities in your base. All with different perspectives. The head scientist prefers you capture aliens instead of killing them. The lead engineer could care less. The ring leader is your even keeled assistant, helping you, and keeping you on point. It all blends together to make a convincing game world where you save the entire planet one mission at a time.","December 5, 2014","true","70.9"," 59 of 67 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","59","67","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Brotmeister/recommended/200510/","Brotmeister","Hans Brotmeister","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Brotmeister/","352 products in account","XCOM: Enemy Unknown is a re-imagining of the classic X-COM: UFO Defense and as such has a similar setting. Aliens come out of nowhere and attack earth. The multinational organization X-COM has to battle the aliens, reverse engineer their technology to create equipment that is on par with that of the invaders and eventually defeat them. As the X-COM commander the player decides about the building of base facilities, instructs the scientists and engineers, is in charge of the deployment of soldiers and commands them in battle.\n\nXCOM: Enemy Unknown naturally takes much inspiration from the older X-COM games but also changes quite a bit. Some of those changes are actually good. Some are rather bad and some are just horrible.\n\nIn this game you have one base and cannot construct additional ones like in the previous entries in the series. Also the squads have been downsized to four people at the beginning and six with upgrades. I actually like that because it counteracts the grindy nature of the game a little bit. Building one base to completion takes quite a lot of time anyway. Also while playing the original games I always took machines with me because they would take four squad slots thus reducing the number of soldiers I had to command. Spending the whole first turn with just moving a dozen people out of the landing craft was tedious. Also there are character classes now. Every class gets to choose from different abilities to learn as they level up. This adds depth to your squad selection, especially since squads are smaller now. The game also mixes up the grindyness with some missions that have special objectives not seen in previous entries. The developers also chose to have some non-interchangeable talking characters at your base. That actually adds a lot of personality to the game and I really like it. In my opinion XCOM: Enemy Unknown gets those changes right. However, there are changes that are more problematic.\n\nThe previous X-COM games use an action point system. Moving, shooting, ducking, turning, switching out equipment all takes away from your soldier's action points. XCOM: Enemy Unknown however drops the action points. You just have two actions per turn. For example moving and then moving some more. Or moving and then shooting. This system would not be so bad if it was not flawed. Shooting ends the soldier's turn. Reloading also does. Because of that there is not benefit to standing and shooting as opposed to moving and shooting. Also, reloading and shooting in the same turn is not possible. Reaction shots to enemy movement in the earlier games where possible whenever the soldier ended his turn with enough unused action points. In this game however, you need to activate the ability "Overwatch" to have the chance of a reaction shot. Using this ability also ends your soldier's turn. Also whenever moving you have to decide beforehand where to move. You cannot move step by step to check if you got a line of sight to the enemy. If you have no line of sight at the end of your movement you cannot shoot. That is especially frustrating because unlike in the prequels it can be very hard to judge if you will have line of sight after moving to a certain position.\n\nCover in this game does not act as physical barrier anymore, it's just a modifier on the attacker's hit roll. Yes, it gives a certain protection from enemy fire but everybody can be hit at all times given there is a line of sight to his cover. This doesn't work well with the games' rigged RNG rolls. Sometimes enemies will just one-hit your soldiers who are standing behind heavy cover from a great distance while your soldiers have problems hitting enemies that are five meters away from them in the open. In the original games you could stand so close to enemies that missing was virtually impossible because an actual projectile was going out on a 2D plane. Also, there is no collision detection for shots anymore. In the previous X-COM entries you had to be careful with your positioning because friendly fire could be a serious threat. Now you can only hit the target that you were aiming at in the first place. It is not possible to accidently hit a teammate or another enemy instead.\n\nXCOM: Enemy Unknown handles armor in a bad way. Armor does not reduce damage taken. It just adds more hit points. In the classic games energy armor would make a soldier nearly invincible against small weapons. In this game however a soldier in the heaviest armor can be worn down by sticks and stones given there are enough sticks and stones thrown at him.\n\nI think it is great that there are character classes now. The problem is that soldiers start without a character class. They get assigned one after their first promotion. This assigment is random though. That means if you need more soldiers of a certain class you have to constantly take rookies with you and hope that they survive, get their promotion and turn out to be the class that you have wanted in the first place.\n\nSome of the upgrades have the only point of battling bad design choices. You can for example upgrade your weapon technology to slowly reload automatically over time. Also, with the gene mods you can use in the expansion you can enhance your soldiers with hit point regeneration per turn and with an ability that makes them untargetable in cover given that the enemy did not see them at the beginning of your turn before moving into cover. You can also buy an upgrade to have your rookies already start with a character class. However it is still random. Those are sure nice upgrades but none of them would be necessary if reloading, cover, armor and classes would not have been handled that badly.\n\nEnemy movement: This is the aspect of the game the does not want me to recommend it. The game has many flaws but this one is just infuriating. Every time you spot a group of enemies they get a free turn of movement to get into cover, flank you or run towards you. This happens during your turn - in a turn-based strategy game. Also, most of the enemies appear in groups now and you always trigger the whole group of them. It often happens that you move all your soldiers without seeing any enemy and then you discover an alien squad with your last soldier, letting them get into optimal positions to fire at you in their upcoming turn. This doesn't work well together with enemy types that can one-hit kill rookies, converting them into bullet-sponge zombies afterwards. After you spot them they use their reaction movement to get closer and immediately close in for the kill in their turn.\nIt happens really rarely that enemies move before you discover them. In most cases they are standing in place waiting to be triggered like land mines. Because of that melee combat is completely unviable now. In the classic games you could sneak up on enemies if they were not looking in your direction. Now they always now that you are there and start moving at once. Also, sometimes enemies will just drop from the sky - sometimes right next to you - making all planning and tactics kind of useless. The only other game in which I have seen such levels of lazyness in enemy placement and AI was Dragon Age 2.\n\nI still have my fair share of fun with the game and maybe you will too. But as it is I cannot recommend it since it is full of really weird design choices some of which are so blatantly bad I cannot even imagine what the developers were thinking. Sometimes it is really infuriating. The most frustrating thing is that the developers got so much right just to screw up royally in other departments.\n\nIf there would be a re-release with a proper action point system and decent enemy movement and placement XCOM: Enemy Unknown could easily become one of my favourite games of all time despite its other flaws. As it is now it sadly cannot.\n\nMore reviews here","August 20, 2014","false","57.3"," 280 of 418 people (67%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","67","280","418","15","12"

In some ways its quite limited here and there compared to original X-Com titles of 80s, but overall, I'm loving this game.\n\nThings to love about XCOM:\n- replayability - every new game is fun in its own way\n- hella lots of fun with 2nd wave options (after you complete the game and decide to start another one, some new options unlock, randomizing your game)\n- great customization (make sure you get all DLCs for this)\n- interesting missions, good map variety (Enemy Within, Slingshot DLCs)\n- the game sometimes gets quite brutal, wiping your team in a matter of seconds. Now try playing in Ironman mode, where you can't load! While this feels horrible, it forces you to learn your sub-optimal strategy won't work well in higher difficulties. Which is a good thing, overall.\n\nThings to note:\n- losing soldiers makes you feel bad\n- enemies hitting with unrealistic odds every now and then\n- your soldiers may miss 3-4 shots with 80-99% accuracy, one after another (don't worry, 100% shots always hit, although they may miss even at point-blank if its not 100%)\n- some game mechanics seem weird and take time getting used to\n- loading a game won't make your soldier hit instead of missing. More than that - your soldier may actually miss instead of hitting!\n- skipping a DLC mission will make it never return (in Enemy Within), so don't skip it. It comes back in Enemy Unknown. Launcher treats these as separate games.\n- some bugs 3 years after release. Nothing game-breaking, though.\n\nOverall - I absolutely LOVE this game and highly recommend anyone who played Xcom of the past or any tactical shooters.

You build labs, workshops, satellite arrays, order new equipment, choose your research projects, hire new soldiers, and so on. Basically, you'll be stressing over budget and deadlines ("How many sectoids corpses and UFO parts do I need to sell to build that satellite to save Egypt? Wait, what is this? Dang it, 1 month to research a half-decent armor? Should I get more scientists?").\n\nBut of course, the core of the game are the field missions. Every in-game month you get roughly 4 or 5 of them. Most of the time your goal is simply to eradicate all hostiles targets. Every now and then you'll receive special council missions where you have to extract/escort a VIP or deactivate some bomb. In addition to all that, the Slingshot DLC adds three story-driven council missions and the expansion pack Enemy Within includes another set of linked council missions (you have to enable them before starting a new game[i.imgur.com]).\n\nThe combat requires some thinking. You'll be controlling a small squad (usually 4 to 6 units). If you move your soldiers around like they're a bunch of kids high on sugar, you're going to get your butt handed to you on an alien platter before you can say "yolo swag 360 noscope". So, don't spread your team out! Instead, keep them tightly together if you haven't engaged the enemy yet. This is especially true if you're playing on Classic or Impossible difficulty. The first time I played, I thought the game was stupid and obscenely unfair, but upon reflection I realized I was playing too aggressively and with complete disregard to the true nature of the cover system. With that in mind, learn the strengths and weaknesses of each soldier's class (assault, heavy, sniper, support) and how the cover system really works. Always go for full cover. Most of the time half cover is a big fat NOPE! If a soldier is in half cover and you can't take the alien down in your turn, hunker down or move to full cover! When attacking, your chance to hit is based on a lot of factors as the aim skill of the soldier, type of cover of your target, range, weapon used... The RNG can be a real pain: you're going to miss some 90% shots so always have a plan A, B, C, and D before pulling the trigger.\n\nThere is a decent variety of enemies. During most of the early-mid game you're going to be completely outmatched by the aliens. But in the late game, you'll have access to some sweet, sweet gear and, with the Enemy Within expansion, gene mods. At first they may look OP, but in reality the aliens scale with you (damn you, mind-controlling Ethereals and nightmarish Sectopods who take only half damage from all hits. Seriously, curse you!).\n\nAesthetics and sound\nGreg Foertsch, the art director who also worked on Civilization IV and Alpha Centauri, did a stellar job designing the visuals of XCOM. The levels feel dark and creepy, yet the colors and effects are incredibly vibrant. XCOM really breaks the old stereotype of the awesome-but-terribly-ugly strategy game, as you can see it for yourself in the screenshots: (1)[i.imgur.com] (2)[i.imgur.com]. My only complaint is about the textures, even on PC they are basically console-level quality. Usually you're going to look to the battlefield from a considerable distance, so at least it's not that big of a problem.\n\nWhat about the soundtrack? Epic, just epic. Nothing will get you more in the mood of kicking some alien scum ♥♥♥ than the badass deployment song. Kudos for Michael McCann. The guy also did the soundtrack for Deus Ex: Human Revolution, so his work speaks for itself.\n\nStory\nXCOM is not a narrative-driven game. The story is simple: aliens are invanding and your job as commander of XCOM is to lead Earth's finest soldiers against the bloody barbarians. So how this game can elicit such a wide spectrum of emotions, throwing the player in a mix of grief, anger, and joy?\n\nWhy XCOM is so good?\nEvery soldier you get is assigned a gender, nationality and, when he or she is promoted to Squaddie, a random class. Everything else is up to the player. You can edit name, nickname, change physical appearance, choose special abilities, and so on. Differently from other strategy games like Age of Empires or Total War, you're not controlling a vast army of faceless cannon fodder. In XCOM, you typically have a roster of 15 to 25 men. After some time it's inevitable to start forming a bond with your soldiers. The game is hard, is brutal, and it was meant to be played with Ironman enabled, that is, no save scumming, no reloading, no undo.\n\nWhile some games are like a dull superhero movie, where you're never in real danger and you just steamroll your foes, XCOM is more like Shingeki no Kyojin: your enemy will outclass you in every way, eat your best soldiers alive and make the rest go back to the Skyranger ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ in their pants and crying. The thrill of battle, not knowing whether or not your men are going to survive, and the dreadful challenge of facing an unknown enemy: that's XCOM. Well Commander, it seems your wits and courage are the only hope humanity has left.\n\nA last note about the DLC\nAlready have XCOM: Enemy Unknown? Maybe you got it for free voting for the Golden Joystick Awards 2014? There are two small DLC:\n\nThe Slingshot Content Pack adds three new missions, an unique character, and five new achievements.\nThe Elite Soldier Pack just add a few comestic options for customizing armors and one new hairstyle.\nAs you see, they're kind of cool but not really necessary. Maybe if there is a nice sale and you have some money laying around...\n\nNow, the must-have is Enemy Within, the third big one. It's an incredible expansion pack with a lot of new awesome content. New items, new aliens, new human (!) enemy faction, genetic modifications, and MEC Troopers. Yeah, you read it right. Freaking M-E-C-H-S! I can't remember a more satisfying moment in my recent gaming history than the first time my Norwegian mech Odin falcon punched a Thin Man in the face!\n\nIf you don't have XCOM: Enemy Unknown yet, grab the "XCOM:Enemy Unknown Complete Pack" when it's on sale. It includes everything and with a 75% discount it's a total steal!","December 29, 2014","true","158.4"," 45 of 55 people (82%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","82","45","55","2","6"

Released in 2012 and using the UE3 Engine, Enemy Unknown takes place in a future where aliens have invaded earth and you are the last line of defense. As the commander, you direct soldiers turn-based style to eliminate alien threats, secure objectives, and more. At the end of each mission, prior to the start of the next, you have the ability to use do research, and create new technologies, as well as handle your finances.\n\nVisually, I think the game looks pretty good for being 3 years old. The fog of war is well done, and there are multiple difficulty settings to give players even more of a challenge. I played on Impossible mode, as well as Ironman mode, with all the special features turned on to make the game as challenging as possible and it worked. The AI is great and can present a challenge to those who rush in, forcing you to actually use tactics to clear objectives. Enemy Unknown also has an expansion called, XCOM: Enemy Within, which adds a variety of content. The Elite Edition contains all DLC Content and is the best deal if you are interested in picking up this game. I'm not a huge fan of turn-based gameplay, but this is actually a really great game, nicely done, and worth paying for.","September 11, 2015","true","3.3"," 36 of 46 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","36","46","0","0"

I found the tactics in this game to easier than in the original (especially in the beginning), but the base management side more challenging to figure out, which is good (WAY too easy to make easy millions in the original). I LOVE the "chunky" aesthetics of the game that are a throwback to the original's look, and I've even taken a liking to the change from time units to Final Fantasy Tactics style combat; it really helps the game move along at a nice pace without changing the feel of combat very much. I always used to leave enough time units in the earlier X-COM's to move behind cover and crouch after a shot, so I am pleased that this whole sequence of ducking in and out of cover to fire is built into the game's cover-mechanic. The alien's getting a free move when you see them does not bother me in a thematic sense (they're on "free-move-overwatch" I guess), though it is sometimes immersion-breaking, since you know you cannot be shot at until you "activate" a group of aliens. A bit different feel than the original, due to unseen aliens not shooting, and XCOM soldiers being MUCH harder to kill.\n\nAnyways, I LOVED IT. I haven't encountered the bugs I've seen others complain about, fortunately, and Firaxis has somehow made this game even MORE addictive/compelling than the original, with that same "just one more turn" feel that the Civilization series has. I totally see the complaints about the camera with multi-level maps, though; it's really terrible!\n\nAlso, it feels a bit more scripted than what I was expecting, both in the strategic level (3 uninterceptible abduction missions at the same time) and tactical level (aliens don't move until encountered).","November 13, 2014","true","57.0"," 29 of 35 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","29","35","0","0"

Firstly, let me say that I love XCOM. I owned the original UFO Defense for PC and PlayStation, Terror from the Deep, and Apocalypse. I played many reboots including Afterlight and some community made versions as well. This game comes the closest to remaking the original and adds a few nice elements in its own right.\n\nIll list off the bad first. This game is RNG hell! Try this scenario. You’re down to your last move and have a half dead Muton waiting around the corner. You wisely saved your crit happy, shotgun toting, assault run and gun soldier. You confidently streak towards your adversary with only a slight degree of separation as you stop moving. You check your aim, breathe a sigh of relief at the 98% hit chance. You fire away only to find your Muton buddy laughing furiously as you miss. How did I miss at point blank distance with a shotgun!? Next turn my emboldened Muton friend slaughters my cross eyed soldier with one quick shot to the face. This in turn causes a nearby rookie to freak out and panic. He begins shooting my colonel in the back causing her to bleed out. From this point on in your life, 99% will never be a sure thing again.\n\nNow here is the good. Excellent challenge. This game forces you to think ahead and plan accordingly. Do you think you mastered the game? Try classic or impossible difficulty with ironman enabled. And if that’s not enough try out the long war mod. Both tactical and base management layers offer enough strategy and replayability to keep anyone that likes strategy games entertained for at least two playthroughs. Now add all the alien lore discovered by engaging new aliens and base side research and development, and you have one engrossing experience.\n\nGraphics and sound are fantastic. The game presents in an isometric top down orientation for the tactical aspect. In between turns you can sometimes hear the ominous movements of moving aliens or mortified screams from unsuspecting civilians. Environments are very detailed and there are enough unique maps to not see any repeats on a single play-through. Music is great, but still doesn’t beat the PlayStation soundtrack in my humble opinion.\n\nI highly recommend that any person wanting to experience a great turn based strategy game pick up Enemy Unknown and at least the expansion Enemy Within. Despite the RNG issues, the game is a solid, well thought out attempt to make XCOM relevant again. Fraxis did this game some justice for both stalwart XCOM veterans and new players alike. XCOM 2 has already exceeded my expectations as well. I however think this game belongs in anyone’s collection.\n","May 8","true","241.5"," 20 of 24 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","20","24","2","0"

It's worth of your time.\nIf you don't know the serie, but you just like playing good games, play it!\nIf you are fan of the original serie and you think that everything after X-COM: Terror From the Deep which has XCOM in the title is a blasphemy, don't touch this!\n\nLike this review?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/henkkaart/recommended/200510/","henkkaart","Henkka","http://steamcommunity.com/id/henkkaart/","597 products in account","I really don't know what to write about XCOM: Enemy Unknown. One one hand it is a great tactical strategy game with some cool features, on the other hand it seems to be either unintentionally broken or designed so horribly that it basically makes the turn-based gameplay pointless.\n\nVisually XCOM is great, mostly. The designs, weapons, armors, vehicles and bases in addition to most of the aliens are really nice looking and have variety to them. The human characters, mainly the male soldiers are rather unnerving in appearance. The female soldiers are mostly ok and the story characters work well. The music sets the mood and there are some good standout pieces (especially the "Ready for battle" song).\n\nNow, I know that the franchise is a meat grinder of sorts, fighting tooth and nail to win one battle at a time with the ever-looming threat of making that one bad call and getting a TPK even on a regular search and destroy mission. And I am fine with that.\n\n1. Not being able to choose the class of your soldiers when they start ranking up. You would think this is an OK feature and perhaps if it worked well enough it would be. Now it is completely random (or at least I haven't found out how to affect it through my own actions): I started a new game, played the first few missions and leveled up my squad only to find out that 2 of them became snipers, one went to become a heavy and another an assault class. Ok, so early in the game that is not a big problem but when I bought an additional squad member position to my team and picked the next rookie to go on a mission things went from "silly team composition" to "how does this even work": I now had 3 snipers in my team in addition to the heavy and assault. A basic abduction mission is easy to handle even with an uneven team but when I have to race against time to save civilians of disarm a bomb and three of my squad members can't move and shoot/overwatch at a low level is a big problem. Sure, I could have picked other rookies and started to level them up but once you play few missions and every perk you gain when leveling up is of great importance, you rather choose the ones you have as high level as possible to ensure that a TPK doesn't happen. Especially since the panic levels increase fast in the first hours of the game.\n\n2. Me see evil; me no shoot evil. I have come to learn that unless you have a 100% chance to hit a target, you will more than likely miss. It doesn't matter if the percentage is at 90; out of 10 shots with 90% probability to hit the target, your soldiers will hit maybe, just maybe, half of them. Even if the target is standing in an adjacent square. And what is absolutely baffling to me is that your soldier can stand only one square away from the enemy unit that is standing in the open and your soldier's hit percentage is only 65.\n\nI witnessed a case where 4 of my soldiers were surrounding a Muton (the big green hulk) that was hiding behind a one square sized cover (an alien artefact that needed to be salvaged so no rocket launchers). The soldiers were positioned so that only one of them wasn't flanking the enemy unit aka the cover was between them. The other three soldiers were one square away from it, flanking from the sides and behind with no cover )this would mean a red shield if it was a player controlled soldier). It took all four of them to bring down the Muton that had already lost half of its HP. Two of my soldiers, the one not flanking and one of the flanking soldiers missed and the rest to managed to hit and kill the Muton. Now, if this was to happen the other way around, 4 enemy units surrounding one of the soldiers, the soldier would have been killed instantly, no misses. It is as if the aliens have a naturally better chance at every shot they take, no matter how good my soldiers' gear is.\n\nAlso, when an alien like a sectoid is half the map away from my soldier (that would have maybe 10-15% chance to hit the sectoid if it was the soldier's turn) and the sectoid not only hits my soldier who is behind a cover and deals critical damage, I call BS. It seems that when the distance grows, the likelyhood for my soldiers to hit the target diminishes, fairly quickly I might add (which in itself is logical). However, it seems that no matter how far the enemies are, they are more than likely to hit you, no matter the elevation difference. Also the "higher elevation boost" for soldiers, especially snipers is ridiculous. I have only once seen it give any advantage and that was when the sniper was only few squares away from the enemy unit that wasn't behind cover and even then with the S.C.O.P.E. the hit probability didn't rise to more than 80%.\n\n3. Bullet trajectory. A minor but most irritating and definitely a design flaw in the game is the way bullets, plasma, lasers and whatnot fly when someone is shot. If the game calculates the hit/miss before the actual animation is shown, it would be nice to not see bullets or other death rays to hit a target and then see "Missed" in the notification. I mean, how hard is it to program the animations to "miss" when the statistics state that the shot missed the target? It is really confusing to see my soldier take hit from a volley of plasma and then get "Missed" when I was already mentally prepared to see the soldier die. It is just bad design.\n\n4. Statistical cover and visual cover. Sometimes it seems that no matter how well in cover you are, you get hit. I don't fully know how the cover works, perhaps full cover is nothing more than "a crit denier": you take hit but don't get hit with a crit, similar to "hunker down". Sometimes the bullets and whatnot seem to hit the environment, sometimes they travel straight through it and hit the target. It is rather difficult to place a sniper in a good position to overwatch when you can't tell for certain if a wall is just there for level design purpose or if it is actually a wall/cover. One time my sniper was in a place I never would have expected for him to be able to shoot anybody but surely enough he just calmly stood up and shot an enemy unit through a couple square thick spaceship wall.\n\n5. No free aim. This might seem a pointless nitpick but I think that removing the possibility to shoot other than just visible aliens is a silly thing. The game has destructible environments, the rocket launchers and grenades have free aim and there are features in the maps that can become environmental hazards for both the XCOM and the aliens.\n\n6. Overwatch works some of the time. The idea of overwatch is important if one wants to survive the missions and more than once it has saved my squad. However, I find it ridiculous that every soldier shoots at the same time if a target comes into their field of view. Once I had 3 soldiers, 2 assaults and a sniper take a shot at a single target: the assault with a plasma rifle slaughtered the target, the second assault and sniper therefore shot at nothing remarking "I've missed the target" which is funny since the target was already rendered into atoms. Oh, and most times, if the target isn't less than 5 squares from the soldiers, they are more than likely to miss, even if the target is in the open.\n\n7. Enemy movement on my turn. How this feature got through the QA is beyond me. How can you make a turn-based strategy game when the enemy units always get a freebie when you spot them? Wouldn't it be more logical that they move around the map even when you have not yet spotted them instead of creeping in one spot and then scattering around like cockroaches when you finally spot them? I find it immensely bad design that they can move to a cover and then take a full turn after the player has completed their turn. Many more times than I want to remember, I have spent my actions covering my units while assuming the enemy coming from the darkness only to spot them with my last soldier and see them reposition themselves flanking me and then have a turn to TPK my team.","December 8, 2013","false","31.6"," 208 of 359 people (58%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","58","208","359","10","16"

The deep and evolving gameplay is among the best I've experienced in a game like this, along with the fact that everything feels extremely polished and crafted with a a great deal of love for both the genre and the original game.XCOM: Enemy Unknown is a worthy tribute to its progenitor and hopefully the start of something brand new for players who've been dying to get a good squad-based strategy game that lets them not only think, but feel as well.To say that XCOM: Enemy Unknown is a phenomenal remake would be selling Firaxis' monumental accomplishment short. The developer hasn't just managed to capture the spirit of the original; they've also tweaked, trimmed, and innovated enough to deliver the freshest, most engaging strategy game in recent memory, if not ever.Even if you don't like strategy games, if you love action games and have an open enough mind to try out something a bit slower-paced, you will be rewarded with one of the most thrilling, thought-provoking, and heart-pounding games of 2012.Amazing tactical complexity, satisfying strategic depth; slightly dodgy ending, but your own stories are more important anyway.

I played it without the expansion my first time through, not to get overwhelmed with research, engineering, and options. And for me that was definitely the best thing to do, because the base game has droves of stuff in it to keep you invested.\n\nThe hours flew by like so many overconfident Interceptors and pregnant Skyrangers birthing my soon-to-be-sorry-or-promoted Alien Death Squads of dashing, grenade-tossing, laser-wielding soldiers onto the battlefield, again and again. Good times.\n\nIf you have a hard time grasping WHY a certain action is better than another, watch the brilliant Youtube videos of Beaglerush playing it on Ironman Impossible. You will still mess up at times, but just watching a few minutes of those videos took the game from being "pretty cool" to being "an absolute joy to play and finish".

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/wirdjos5/recommended/200510/","wirdjos5","Wirdjos","http://steamcommunity.com/id/wirdjos5/","89 products in account","This remake of the 1993 X-COM: UFO Defense, an obtuse and painful but ultimately satisfying game, attempts to bring UFO Defense into the 21st century while also improving on the original game's intentions. Sadly, (or happily depending on your faith in such an endeavor) all of these changes present a double-edged sword. For every system Enemy Unknown improves - and they are solid improvements - something of the freedom or atmosphere of the original is lost. Some sacrifices are small but expected, such as the way you've built your base not having an effect on base invasions (a feature that itself was only added to the remake with the Enemy Within expansion). Others are a bit more surprising, such as the total change in atmosphere brought about by taking the original troop limit of 14 down to the much smaller squad of 6. Limiting the number of soldiers on the field at a time means that each individual is more valuable and stands out more readily which is also bolstered by an increased level of customization. I found myself even more attached to my Enemy Unknown soldiers than my UFO Defense regulars and as that attachment was one of the biggest joys of the original, it's hard not to consider that a successful change. However, with only 6 soldiers gaining battle experience at a time, any casualty is devastating, meaning you can no longer afford to send a group of bright-eyed red shirted rookies into a situation as you, an experienced commander, know it is unlikely they will survive. So that sense of constant Pyrrhic victories, of losing three men to breach a downed UFO and eliminate the final alien, are lost to gain a more beloved solider with a richer player-made story. This difference encapsulates the transition between the two games. While UFO Defense focused on the greater conflict, with individual soldiers representing little more than a resource, Enemy Unknown focuses on those called to fight and how this conflict affects them. The overarching narrative hasn't changed much, but the change in perspective makes for a unique, fresh experience.\n\nThat being said, Enemy Unknown can stand (and fall) on its own as well. The terror of a completely unknown threat and the slow unveiling of what it is you're fighting and why it's fighting you is satisfying without depending on the crutch of name dropping the original's enemies. The unlikelihood of any one shot being 100% certain in accuracy or damage forces the player to come up with backup plans and to deal with the unexpected, keeping the player on his or her toes. Sometimes, however, the unexpected comes not from an intended monkey wrench, but from an obtuseness in the game's mechanics. After completing two full games on two different difficulties, I still have a very poor idea of what a soldier will or will not be able to see and where. This disastrous flaw could have easily been corrected if I had the option to see from the soldier's point of view. Graphical glitches are also relatively common leading to a rushed and unfinished feel which is only compounded by the expansion, Enemy Within. Meld - a resource introduced in the expansion to fuel the new gene modifying and MEC trooper initiatives - both adds a new time element to missions and sticks out as completely artificial. Again this issue seems like it could be simply resolved with a bit more story relevance and/or more logical placements. The 'abduction' mission type seems equally artificial in that they always occur in threes, leaving the commander to choose only one site to defend while leaving the others to their fate and causing panic across those continents. The player is left with no solution to this 'one step forward two steps back' situation nor is there any explanation for why that's so. Which leads me to my biggest complaint about Enemy Unknown: The whole experience feels like it's on rails. Not only doesn't the alien invasion operate on its own independent timescale (a theme which is repeated with the aliens I meet in the field), but it doesn't even seem like anything I as the player do has an affect on how the invasion plays out, past the basic win-lose proposition. Due to this design direction, some story elements can't reach a satisfying conclusion. For instance, the comparison between the alien's situation and XCOM's current trajectory never pays off. The aliens seem to have undergone some great cruelty which is played up from the beginning as being both inhumane and the reason they're so effective, but there is little to no consequence for the XCOM project visiting the same cruelty on its own soldiers to match the enemy's results. This is possibly the most interesting story this setting has to tell and yet it's simply pushed aside once the situation is realized.\n\nStumbling blocks like these keep this exciting, ensnaring game from achieving the greatness it seems to be aiming for. But if you're prepared for a little (or a lot) of that 'what could have been' frustration, it's not the worst way to spend a good chunk of your time.","January 26","true","109.7"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","11","11","0","0"

I started the game and was doing extremely well... until the stressfull atmosphere got the best of me and I stopped playing right before the alien base assault (sorry for the spoilers). Then I saw the announcement trailer for xcom 2 six months later and remembered how awesome the game was (and how awesomely powerful my assault soldier Sasha Boroso was). So, as any courageous man would do, I opened up the game again, chose my ironman game and booted it up. I wasted no time and headed right to the alien base as brave and heroic as ever. I entered the base, explored a little, and, finding no aliens in the immediate vicinity, relaxed a little and said to myself: "See! It's not too hard! Nothing to be scared of!". I opened the first door and found a floater that I could easily flank with Shasa Boroso's run & gun skill. So I rushed in... only to realize that there were 3 chrysalids right behind. They immediatly surrounded Shasa... and I was left with little choice but to go all in and try to explode them all (and hopefully not Shasa) with my heavy's rocket launcher. So, I crossed my fingers, closed with anger the game's warning about damaging a friendly, and shot. Well... the floater was killed (yay?) but the 3 chrysalids were still alive... AND SO WAS SHASA! So I ended my turn with glee and hoped that maybe it was lunch break for the aliens and that the chrysallids would simply turn and run off. IT WAS LUNCHBREAK! ... except they didn't turn... nor run off... Actually they, took turns munching on my precious Shasa that died and became a zombie. At that point my fingers lingered over ctrl+alt+del, but I grabbed hold of myself and said: "HEY! YOU'RE TOUGHER THAN THAT! THE EARTH NEEDS YOU!". So I killed the chrysallids with my heavy and a smile returned to my face. Yeah... but then Shasa's zombie came and killed my heavy with a 7 damage hit and poison (7! REALLY 7 AND POISON! CHRYSALIDS DON'T EVEN DO THAT MUCH AND THEY'RE ALIENS!)... Then I really got angry, closed the game through the task manager, and hoped it wouldn't have saved. ... But no, it had, and there was no reverting to autosaves since I was on ironman. So it was officially at that moment that I started to cry. And amidst the sadness, the pain, and the suffering, I realized that me abandoning earth was acually a good thing!

Before I start with the good, I think I should look at the bad.\n\nFirst thing that comes to my mind for what's bad about this game is its value for money. The Xbox 360 and Playstation 3 have what's essentially a Game of the Year edition (dubbed XCom Enemy Within: Commander Edition) which comes with the base game, the Elite Soldier cosmetics, the Slingshot Pack, and Enemy Within, all for an MSRP of how much you'd pay for the base game on Steam. Because of this, you're better off waiting until March 4 for the Complete Edition (Essentially the Commander Edition for PC)\n\nAnother issue i have with this game is that it does not illustrate your soldiers' line of sight. More often than not, I found myself moving a soldier to a piece of cover where I would think has a good shot at an alien, though I end up wasting his or her turn due to a lack of line of sight. This is even more of a nuisance for players who enjoy using Snipers with the early-game Squadsight ability.\n\nAnd now for the good: While it's a difficult game in its own right, it certainly has enough content for several playthroughs. While you may get intimidated by the fact that you're often outgunned, you'll learn to get used to the combat. However, shooting aliens is only half of the game.\n\nThe other half of the game consists of the XCOM Headquarters, where you will need to research new technologies, arm both your soldiers and aircraft, shoot down UFOs, and manage global panic. Oh, and because you'll find yourself dealing with simultaneous abduction events, you'll find yourself having more problems with global panic than the actual combat, but this doesn't necessarily make the game unfair, as the resources to maintain panic are reasonably accessible.\n\nThe final verdict: GET THIS GAME","February 5, 2014","true","90.5"," 19 of 27 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","19","27","0","1"

Still a third person strategy game. Compared to the original there is a lot less to manage at your xcom base and mission preperation. Feeling a bit dumbed down but much easier for new players. I welcome the change but could of had a bit more options at the xcom base. Character customization is nice but could of had some more options. Combat and gameplay is extremely crisp and fun. If you are not in cover and flanking correctly you are getting your ♥♥♥ toasted. Enemy designs are spot on sounds and wepons sound energized! This xcom offers difficulty modes which further help new players to the series get accustomed and vets get their ♥♥♥♥ wet with unforgiving difficult. 2K continues to uphold excellent 50's themed games and makes me wish I lived back in that time period spot on clothing and areas. There is a decent amount of gameplay here but you are punished for taking your time getting some requirements for other missions and taking every side mission for extra xp and items. Feeling like you are on a timer the whole time you will feel rushed half way through the game ruining the experience. There are very little cutscenes though the ones that are there are perfectly fine. I will say this is the worst ending to a modern gen game I have ever witnessed. After everything me and my crew went through for a 10 second ending. YES A 10 SECOND ENDING. I felt slapped in the face. Makes Mass Effect 3 forgivable. In the end Xcom enemy unknown leaves you wanting more in every area of the game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Mountain_Man/recommended/200510/","Mountain_Man","Mountain Man","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Mountain_Man/","162 products in account","Summary“That's XCOM, baby!”\n\nReviewXCOM is a game that tests your understanding of probabilities.  If you think it should be impossible to miss three 75% chance shots in a row, or that a 95% chance is a guaranteed hit, then you're going to have a bad time.  This is a game that will punish you for your mistakes, mercilessly grind your successes under its heel, and basically conspire to beat you at every turn, leading to a tense, addictive experience that will knock you down and keep you coming back for more.  It works because while the game is brutal, it's fair, which has inspired fans of the series to coin the phrase, “That's XCOM, baby!”\n\nThe premise is this: the earth has been invaded by extraterrestrials, and in keeping with the trope, they are aggressive and more technologically advanced than us mere humans.  The XCOM project is an international organization, and you, as its commander, are given the unenviable task of protecting earth from the hostile invaders.  Failure to diligently carry out this objective will result in member nations panicking and pulling funding, which means fewer resources at your disposal and eventually defeat if enough nations leave you high and dry.\n\nGameplay happens in two phases: base management and missions.  Your base is depicted in a really cool cutaway view, showing your facilities deep underground.  While it's not the most functional presentation, the attention to detail is amazing, and you can zoom right in close and see what your personnel are up to.  It's purely cosmetic because all of the real work happens in menus, but it's still fun.\n\nDuring the base management phase, you can visit the “Situation Room” to get an overview of how close member nations are to panicking, assign research and construction tasks to your science and engineering staff, maintain your fleet of interceptor aircraft and satellites, hire new recruits, customize and train your soldiers, and expand your facilities.  It's a balancing act because you have limited resources, and each task takes a period of time to complete, so it's important to prioritize your most critical tasks first.\n\nOnce you've organized everything to your satisfaction, you head to Mission Control and click “Scan For Activity” which advances time, completing your various projects and discovering alien activity around the globe.  Sometimes there will be multiple simultaneous attacks, but since you can only respond to one of them, you again have to balance various considerations, such as the expected difficulty of the mission, what sort of rewards you will receive upon successful completion, and how close each nation is to bailing on you.  This is when the real fun begins as you dispatch your troops to deal with the alien menace.\n\nBefore launching a mission, you have one last chance to fine-tune your roster of soldiers (initially four, but you can eventually have up to six) and their equipment, and then it's time to head out to the field.  Missions take place in a three-quarter perspective turn-based arena with you and the aliens alternating turns, and each unit gets two actions per turn (however, using a weapon will end that soldier's turn even if it's their first action).  This is a perfect realization of Firaxis' “less is more” game design philosophy, because each action you take carries so much weight, and it keeps the pace of battle fast and exciting.  Some people criticize this portion of the game, saying that it's too easy to leapfrog your soldiers from cover to cover, putting them in “Overwatch” which gives them a free shot if the enemy moves into their line of fire, and simply waiting for the aliens to come to you, but this isn't necessarily the best or most effective strategy.  Sometimes you need to be more aggressive, especially during abduction missions where you have to kill the aliens faster than they can kill innocent civilians; then there are the time-limited “meld” canisters you'll want to collect which appear as part of the Enemy Within expansion (which I strongly recommend).  Furthermore, “Overwatch” comes with a to-hit penalty, so there's no guarantee you'll take down the enemy anyway, and even with your most carefully laid plans, things can fall apart in spectacular ways, leading to your soldiers being injured – meaning they'll be out of action until they've healed – or, worse, killed.  It's amazing just how quickly the tables can turn, so it's always important to stay on your toes because sometimes even a single mistake can cost you the mission.\n\nAs your soldiers participate in – or perhaps I should say survive – missions, they gain experience and are randomly given a specialty such as sniper, support, heavy, and so on.  As they continue their careers, you can choose from a variety of special abilities like smoke grenades to make it harder for your enemies to draw a bead on your troops, or allowing your sniper to target any enemies within another soldier's line of sight.  You can even customize your troopers' appearance, nationality, the color of their uniforms, what sort of head gear they wear from full battle helmets to stylish fedoras, and even give them personable nicknames.  All of this is ultimately a cruel tease, however, because it seems like just as you start to become attached to your individualized soldiers, they get brutally killed in a hail of gunfire and their names enshrined on the Memorial Wall where you can revisit your depressing failures whenever you want.\n\nUltimately, XCOM is a vicious slog to your own inevitable defeat at the hands of a superior foe – there's a reason the sequel takes it as a given that the humans lost the war – yet despite it all, I love this game.  As I said earlier, it's brutal but fair.  Yes, there are times you're at the mercy of the “random number generator” gods, but the majority of the time, if you lose, it's your fault.  The reason people think the game cheats is because they remember their losses, like that time they missed two 95% chance shots in a row (and, yes, that is statistically possible), but they forget their wins, like the time they took a desperate gamble on a 40% shot and got a lucky critical.  That's XCOM, baby!\n\nThe presentation is excellent with attractive, detailed visuals and solid sound design.  I especially like the “action cam” that is occasionally triggered during missions and gives you a ground-level view of one of your soldiers taking out an alien (or alternatively, an alien taking out one of your soldiers), or showing one of your troopers kicking down a door or vaulting over a counter.  It's a nice touch and happens infrequently enough not to wear out its welcome.  On the Linux side, Feral once again has done an excellent job giving us Linux fans another top-notch game.\n\nI would also strongly recommend buying the Enemy Within expansion.  This is a proper, old school expansion pack rather than a soft sequel in that the new features are seamlessly incorporated into the base game.  You get access to more soldier upgrades, more maps, more missions, more enemies – basically a more complete and fleshed out XCOM experience.\n\nGood luck, Commander.","February 14","true","27.2"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","2"

You'll grow fond of your soldiers- too fond, perhaps, as they're only ever one unlucky move away from a gruesome and unfair-yet-also-annoyingly-fair death.\n\nThe closest thing to it I believe would be the Heroes of Might and Magic series. It is a game of two halves. About a fifth of the time is spent on the overview screen, the rest in suspenseful battles against lurking aliens.\n\nWhen you're not on the field, you level up your base and choose how to prioritise research and funding. Do you invest in new alien tech? Do you hire new soldiers? Do you launch satellites to keep the world peaceful? It's not as punishing as I would have feared. You're not going to dig yourself into a corner by choosing the 'wrong' decisions. In a way you're simply choosing how you want to fight your foe. There's enough depth and complexity to keep you going until the end of the game and you'll want to play it a second game to see just how different an alternative approach can be.\n\nAnd then there are the battles. You gradually advance your troops across a variety of different battlefields, trying to scout out the enemies whilst remaining safe enough to withstand their retaliation. These adventures span somewhere between 10-30 minutes each and are all gripping and beautifully done affairs. You'll get angry when your characters miss an easy shot, but will squeal with glee when they somehow hit something through 2 walls and a car window. It really is something to behold.\n\nThe down-sides? The graphics aren't too good and yes, it is annoying when your characters die. It almost makes you want to re-load- BUT DON'T DO THAT!

Later on, your pilots are flying the Firestorm, highly advanced fighter ship which is more or less alien in origin, and can be equipped with such awesome firepower as the plasma cannon, or the fusion lance.\n\nYour weapons and armour similarly are upgraded as you progress through the research tree, starting with basic weapons as you might find these days, upgrading to lasers, and then plasma weapons.\n\nSo, what are you waiting for? Go kick some alien butt.","September 11, 2015","true","219.0"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","90","9","10","2","1"

It has streamlined or removed some aspects of the original game, for better or worse. To me the changes are mostly all positive. Game still feels familiar enough to appeal to many of the veterans.\n\nXcom gameplay consists of two parts, the tactical combat on the field and little bit of base management. In base management you get limited options to build laboratories, workshops, power generators, satellite uplinks etc. with their different benefits. You can purchase different kind of perks with games currency, you can research new tech, manufacture new items and gear in engineering and sell items you acquire on missions on black market.\n\nThe combat itself is really fun, you have different classes of soldiers and you can level them up by completing missions and shooting up aliens. With levels (promotions) you can choose one of two special abilities depending on your soldiers class. Different classes are sniper, support, assault and heavy.\n\nThere is a multiplayer option but it's a bit lacking. You can only play 1vs1 matches with your custom made squads. Somekind of co-op would be nice.\n\nFiraxis games really is the master of turn-based strategy with Xcom and Civilization. I recommend everyone to get the expansion pack Enemy Within, even for the first playthrough. Since it doesn't add new campaign but implements new storyline in the orginal games campaign. It also comes with new tech and some new enemies. Another recommendation would be playing with Iron man mode on, when every death of your squad is permanent. Since then game autosaves and you cant save manually. It really adds some great tension to the game.\n\nAn amazing reimagining of a classic that works really well either on keyboard and mouse or a gamepad!\n\n[Score: 95]","January 18, 2013","true","117.4"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Whiteswart/recommended/200510/","Whiteswart","Whiteswart","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Whiteswart/","1424 products in account",""XCOM: Enemy Unknown" is an eligible descendant of a blockbuster strategy series "UFO". It responds to roots with piety and conscience. Yet, it's a completely different game - and I think I know the reason. It is a victim of new age in game design. A casualty of "fit to casuals" tendency.\n\nIf you want a clear picture, imagine a cute girl. She was born to sweet-hearted and smart parents. She is nice by nature, as they say. She has no problems with seducing almost every guy in her class. And then she goes to high school, where somebody occasionally points to our girl that she is too fat to be popular. Or too witty. Whatever. Our girl is too good to not abide those stupid marketing rules. And then comes diet. No fat. No protein. No books. Only to look "decent" compared to the so-called high school elite.\n\nSee, she's still real pretty. But very skinny too. And she never allows herself to be really clever. Never slips more-than-one-word-a-second from her mouth. She doesn't smile now.\n\nOr maybe she doesn't smile just for me?\n\nLet's take a closer look at her.\n\nFirst thing we see is a very cunning make-up. Visuals and sounds are great, all those movie-type cut scenes in game are fascinating, and some of them bringing good memories for those who have seen the original UFO game.\n\nNext thing we'll be involved is a sharp turn-based shootout with unknown lifeforms, rational and deadly. We gotta think tactical to overcome it, one wrong step and your soldier will die in vain, making others stunned and shocked, just to be shot in the next turn.\n\nThose two parts, visuals and chess-like tactical shootouts are dominant. A primo. Sales hook. Love the game for those - and you won't be disappointed. But if you are a geek like myself or just remember good old UFO ... let's go further.\n\nNext, we see a kind of a micromanagement system, a strategic part of game. There come the bad signs. See, economical part of "XCOM: enemy unknown" is anything but realistic. It's manageable, balanced... but dull and frustrating. Most players will spend more time personalizing suits of every soldier in squad than in "strategic" part of game.\n\nNext… we see restrictions. The most powerful military alliance in the world have only one transport plane, for six soldiers maximum. So if aliens are striking in three places, we can secure only one of them. Two others will be infected. That’s cadaverous feature, reflecting to both size of invasion in contrast to human forces AND modern gamedev tendency to "make moral choices”. X-com organization can deploy only one aircraft at the time to shoot even a Battleship or Carrier type UFO. Only if it will be shot down, they let you send another… but even a heaviest UFO can outfly our interceptors. X-com can’t directly hire engineers and scientists – it relies on small grants from council from time to time. .. And so on, and so forth…\n\nSo. It can’t be compared with previous games ‘cause they're still way ahead in all terms, except for graphics quality.\n\nBut, returning to our girl portrait, maybe she still deserves to be loved, if only for small things? Not exactly. Her flaws are not brackets that can be turned down sometime. It’s in the thinking. A new age child, never heard of "Depeche Mode". 21st century big media project. That’s not something you'll want to spend life on. All she wants from you is a decent lunch in restaurant, sweet talk with her … and she’ll spend a night with you. Maybe even a week or month – she’s still a good girl from good parents, remember? But no love. No hard feelings. As SWAT says, “we move in, and we move out”.\n\nIt’s not a game “from fans to fans, 4 fun”. It’s a product. AAA Product. Fine by looks, working well for its price, engaging at multiplayer… but definitely not a sleep-taker. Not a masterpiece. Pompous and shiny money-taker, that’s my decision. 7 out of 10.","August 1, 2014","true","253.1"," 22 of 35 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","22","35","0","2"

It is gripping, crafty, and terrifying. An engrossing, deep turnbased combat game, married neatly with a real time strategic base mechanic makes this one of the standout titles of 2012.\n\nX-Com is a successor of the classic X-com titles from the mid to late 90's. While this new title has been developed by a differrent company, Firaxis, they have managed to preserve what was so enthralling about X-Com and the alien threat. With a new engine,powered by Unreal Engine 3, Firaxis brought X-Com to a new generation with slick graphics and fresh gameplay.\n\nX-Com has two main layers. The first is the "meat" of the game, which is the tactical combat. Players are tasked with squads between 4 to 6 elite soldiers, each with varying skills and abilities that are unlocked as they get kills and survive more missions. A range of custumizable options are in the game, such as changing their appearance or names, and choosing different skills as they become available. On the battlefield players are faced with the ever imposing alien threat, which is intelligent and ruthless. The aliens have many different species, which act as the classes. From the lowly sectoid to the fearsome muton, players will be constantly challenged with ever increasing numbers and powers. All the aliens feel very distinct, and the ai does avery good job of keeping players on their toes. They will use any advantage they can get,be it suppression and flanking, or simply ganging up on one man, and will remorselessly destroy the unprepared squad. Thankfully X-Com has a few tricks of their own. As players progress, new armour and weapons become available, such as the S.H.I.V, a mobile weapons platform that replaces a soldier in the field and can act as agressive mobile cover, or the skelton suit, which allows soldiers to use a grapple hook to reach elevated positions. Perfect for getting that sniper in for the kill. Late game will players will see even more advanced alien technologies be adapted for your soldiers use, and even delve in to phsycic abilities.\n\nThe second layer of X-Com is the base management. This is where players are tasked with monitering global panic, issuing promotions to vetrans, researching alien technologies, and contructing a fortified base from which to launch operations. It is here that all new weapons and tactics become available, so it is crucial to manage X-Com's limited resources wisely, as one mistake could leave you  without the proper weapons or technology to survive the increaing alien menace. As permadeath is in the game, players must strive to keep their soldiers equipped with the latest and greatest if they hope to achieve victory. Missions will occur at random and vary from seek and destroy, a timed bomb diffusal in which the player must find and diffuse bombs scattered around the map before an alotted amount of turns, to Vip escorts. Each mission takes place on a randomly chosen map, so no two playthroughs are the same.\n\nX-Com Enemy Unknown is a a fantastic title that will challenge and entertain, and I highly recommend to all types of gamers.","November 25, 2013","true","90.9"," 15 of 22 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","15","22","0","0"

I have never played a strategy game that I really liked. I got this for free when I pre-ordered Bioshock Infinite, along with Civ 5 on GmG. I tried Civ 5 first, but really couldn't get into it at all. So I am only now giving this game a fair chance. I literally said to my best friend that this was the last strategy game that I was going to play if I didn't like this one.\n\nThis game though...This game is great! I can't fault it so far. It sort of feels like a game of chess in a lot of ways. Nice graphics and art style too. Actually, the visuals and music remind me of Deus Ex, which is great. It sounds like the same composer to me.\n\nThere are also a lot of familiar voices, which is actually kind of distracting, because I am trying to figure out where I know the voice from and not concentrating on what they are saying...The council guy sounds like the narrator from Screenjunkies 'Honest Trailers' lol (It IS him!) :D\n\nHaha, and I guessed the other one right too! It's the Dharma Initiative guy from LOST! :D\n\nHa! again! It is the Deus Ex Human Revolution composer too! :D\n\nAnyway, the gameplay and strategy elements are very engaging. You need to plan your moves and take good advantage of cover while getting your squad into position.\nThen there are squad member promotions, weapons upgrades etc. which offer some interesting choices. The engineering and research aspects are very interesting too. You need to prioritise what to develop, research, build etc.\nAt certain points you have to choose where to go and who to help, which causes panic levels to go up in the regions you don't help. So you have to manage panic levels too.\n\nThere is a lot going on here, a lot of re-playability, and very satisfying gameplay. I am finding it quite addictive so far and I am glad that I have finally found a strategy game that I like. This is definitely helped by the way the game is designed and the intuitive, easy to learn UI, which is a big reason why I haven't liked other strategy games that I have played.\n\nSo yeah, very cool game so far.","July 3, 2014","true","38.5"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

As a gamer who played games in early 90s allready and played the first XCOMs when those were brand new. After i played Enemy Unknown i had a feeling that this isnt what i expected.\n\nI bought XCOM long time ago and i must say that i found the price of the DLC outrageous later, especially because it actually added what i expected to be in the base game. Since this experience i dont buy brand new games until they have expansions out and they have GOTY or complete packs available. I miss the 90s and early 2000s when internet not existed or was used only by the minority of the population, because game DEVelopers had only one chance to release their product so they released complete products. Nowadays none of the AAA games complete, if i play any of them i have empty feelings, i feel that something is missing, in sequels i have a feeling that "omg this was in previous version, why not in this" ofc those coming with DLCs but this feeling ruins my entertainment.\n\nIn this case i missed that aliens dont invade my base and a few other things, dont missunderstand that, the game was ok, but when my first playthrough ended, i was like: "ok, that was it? hmmmm am i rushed through or really that was it?"\n\nDo i recommend the base game? yes, if you not played any original XCOM game, but if you dont own the game i suggest the complete pack with DLC (i still find it outrageous that complete pack cheaper than buying the DLC for those who bought the game before, i promised, because of this, that ill never buy DLC but suddenly i got it as gift).\n\nDo i recommend the game with DLC? yes, its awesome, no emptyness feelings, the game got what should have been at release, this what we should have gotten for the price of an AAA game.\n\nThe game is pretty hard and challenging, i liked it, need to plan every movement of your units, i felt some classes are useless, i actually preferred only support and snipers for my crew because supports can explore area and avoid getting hit with ligthning reflexes while exploring and snipers can eliminate enemies from long and safe distance.\n\nBase Game: 3/10 for me at least, its my opinion.\nGame with DLC: 10/10 original XCOM feeling, i wasnt able to stop while i played.\n\nI encountered still a few BUG in the game but usually quiting game and reloading fixed those, so nothing serious.","November 20, 2015","true","55.8"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","9","11","0","1"

How should we treat the immigrants? Should we kill them?\n\nYour immediate response may be: “We should not kill all the immigrants.” Understandable pity. But what if the immigrants are destroying our cities via their plasma weapons?\n\nThis game, XCOM: Enemy Unknown, answers that question; in such a case, we must create a multi-national, multi-gender special forces group with which to kill the disgusting invaders.\n\nYou see, in the game the aliens enter our atmosphere--UNINVITED--and start stealing our women and shooting our men. And for this reason, the commando organization is made--XCOM. XCOM’s elite soldiers fly to the gas stations and grocery stores and office buildings of our pure Earth, in their jet-version of the V-22 osprey, and shoot the aliens. It is..beautiful. Like Mozart.\n\nI love how the game slows down whilst you see an alien take its final bullet, no longer able to withstand human fire. Do you know the film The Matrix? Of course you do. Imagine, though, that instead of Neo dodging bullets, it is outer space foreigners slowly getting torn to pieces by our Made on Earth bullets; the yellow, green blood spewing from the bodies.\n\nCross over the ozone layer without a valid passport now, alien! Oh! You can't? Why? Is it because you are dead?\n\nBut it doesn’t stop with bullets. XCOM eventually gives your troops laser and plasma weaponry, which replace your metal rounds. And they are worth it, so worth it. The laser and plasma are red, green, and bright. They make the killings like Christmas Eve at night. I actually get the shivers thinking about it. Mmmm, yes. I have..so many memories of the glow, bursting through immigrant bodies. I love to just...close my eyes, and conjure up memories from this game. They are so beautiful.\n\nI almost forgot the explosives. Grenades and rockets fling the xenos’ bodies like rag dolls. Unfortunately, though, the game doesn’t slow down and focus the camera on their flying corpses.\n\nYou can also capture the aliens alive. Three times you HAVE to do this. I didn't like those parts.\n\nIf you decide to get this game, you should do so right before a vacation begins. I couldn’t stop..hunting after it began. ALSO, you should get the Enemy Within DLC with the base game. Doing so will let you turn your troops into large, mutilated, killer robots. They lose their humanity, yes, but that’s okay; it helps you kill aliens at a faster rate, and with greater force.\n\nIf XCOM’s aliens came in peace, then I guess it would be okay not to kill them all. But as the game shows, the aliens do not come in peace.\n\nWhen the real aliens land on our planet and start taking away our jobs, we should follow XCOM's example.\n\n9/10","March 27, 2015","true","51.7"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","100","6","6","11","0"

It's a turn based chess match that goes on between you and the computer. Throughout the game you command a base and can research aliens for better technology or understanding, add new departments/building to the base that in turn effect production or improve fire power, and train new units. Such things like plasma snipers that are much more accurate, or jet packs to move efficiently. This is essentially the RPG element that adds an extra depth to the game without it jumping simply level to level. Not all technologies are guaranteed to be studied or recovered. If you do too much damage to an alien, you can very well destroy the body and the weapon. When pursuing the aliens, you have the option to choose which country to intercept them in. Obviously depending on who you've helped will determine their stance with the XCOM organization. Every time you end your turn, there could be an invasion, it could simply stay quiet, or there could be a chance for one of your fighter planes to intercept an alien craft. In-game when fighting, you have the basic choice to move a character, tell them to take cover and keep their head down, attack, or be prepared to attack a moving target. The lastly mentioned option is extremely helpful when making advancements in dangerous or unknown areas. The game does a great job notifying you of movement patterns and the amount of cover available at certain areas.\n\nGraphics are absolutely on point when it comes to this game. It's not the greatest or finest of graphics, but their choice of style absolutely goes with their theme. Sounds are appropriate for the setting, and sounds of aliens can be heard. If they are heard, characters do react to that sound. I must commend the guy who did the camera angles in this game, absolutely well done. The camera zooms in and let's you see (over the shoulder) what the characters see.\n\nOverall a good game and can be very difficult at times if you make the wrong move (so save a lot with multiple slots)! It was a fun game but I felt after playing a good campaign there wasn't much else to play. Challenging a buddy to a shooting chess match is always fun though.\n\nFor what it's worth, I hate turn based games. I managed to make it through this one and actually came back to finish it.\n\n\n\n\nRATING : 7.7/10","June 25, 2014","true","26.7"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","6","6","0","0"

Your job as commander is to exterminate all alien threats. Chase them away from the earth. You have some advisors with you. The Chief engineer , the Chief researcher who give you explainations to what is happening and sometimes give commentary and tips. And officer Bradfort. AKA captain obvious.\nFind the aliens, cature or kill them, research their bodies, use their own technolagie against them, wipe them out and send them back to where ever they came from. Simple but greatly executed in this game.\n\nThe gameplay:\n\nThis is a turn based strategy game. which means: you take a turn and move your characters, then the enemy does the same. You react to the enemy which keeps it fun and suprising because you dont know where they are based in the beginning. you have to search the area with your soldiers until you run into the aliens. You squad consists of 6 soldiers. (4 at the start of the campaign) and different classes ( Assault, Sniper, Support, Heavy) You can choose who and what you want to take into battle. When you take control of a soldier and move him/her around you have a couple different options. Your soldier can only move a number of tiles every turn. This depends on your soldier's abilities ofcourse. Every class has different abilities and weapons to choose from. Back at base you have a overview of your entire base. Which you can expand underground. you have to be careful with your finances and where you invest them in. You have to research alien technology so you can adapt to the enemy. The mechanics in the game are solid.\nCustomize your squad their abilities the colors the names  its enough to choose from. Its really enjoyable to name the soldiers after your friends and family. You actually care more about your soldiers that way and you mourn them when they die. If you want more custom option there is a DLC pack for more options.\n\nGraphics, performance\n\nIts nothing really outstanding but it looks great for a turn based strategy game. Im not a huge graphical fanboy but I do appreciate good graphics which this game delivers. dont get me wrong, its not amazing looking but the graphics do the job for making the world seem believable when you are fighting the aliens on random generated maps. The game has some flaws like the turn not ending, but its nothing game breaking. It just works fine with full 60FPS and no stuttering or anything like that.\n\nConclusion & Final verdict\n\nThis game is a damn well executed turn based strategy game. The mechanics and micromanagement are solid and the game runs well without any issues. It is a remake well done.\nEverything in this game ranged from great to amazing. I even bought the complete edition with all the expansions. The replay value with this game is great, the story is fine and the battles at higher difficulty asked for a even more careful approach. It gave a fair challenge.\nFor me it was a great time playing this and my final verdict for XCOM Enemy unknown is an amazing 9.5/10 A almost perfect remake\n\nDo you enjoy turn based strategy and tactical combat? Pick this game up. you won't regret it.\n\nGood luck out there Commanders!\nWant more recommendations? Come see our reviews on our favorite upcoming games!

I would promise you that at least 90% of the people who have praised this game have not actually played it in a true Ironman and Classic playthrough. And I want to make two poiints here: Why the game fails as a game, and why it fails as an XCOM game.\n\nWhy it isnt an XCOM game:\nThis game is simple, and by that I mean REALLY simple. Xcom enemy Unkown plays like a really old board game(think Monopoly/Risk), the ruleset is extremely simplistic and leave such a large gab to chance that almost all decisions you make are irelevant.\n\nMost people(even those who dislike this game) do not seem to understand this as they complain about 'bugs' that cause shooting through walls, floors, and other things. If you actually play this game and look at the ruleset applied it becomes clear that those were never bugs or oversights, this is simply how this game works. 'Props/Cover/objects/ground' never exists in this game, it all applies a very Warhamer/LOTR/40k logic, but simplified: If you have line of sight on an enemy you can shoot at it, only you and the object matter, the hit calculation is PURELY created by the different effects on a unit.(aka, if he is in cover you get -40% on the hit chance. What is the cover and how is it actually position and what about the 5 other things obscuring the view? Like I said, board game logic.\n\nAs such the shooting through a wall was never a bug, it simply is that the ruleset has no consideration for anything but the 3 or so objects used in the calculation.(That is why there is no free shooting, 'bullets' do not exist, that is why explosions always do the same damage, through walls or not through walls. That is why all cover works in a very binary state of existing or not existing.)\n\nWhy am I rambling on this? The people who played the old Xcoms and say this has the spirit of xcom are utterly wrong, Xcom (as silly as it sometimes was) was in a way  a simulation. It tried to "simulate" squad combat, based on a ruleset that was as 'reaslitic' as would be possible while being fun. If you looked at something and thought about how it would work based on your reasoning then most of the time  it would react the way you expected it to. Bullets would travel, if they missed or were shot at a bad angle they would travel in an angle away from where it meant to go, if the bullet hit an object it would damage or destroy the object, an explosion would damage objects, if the bullet can travel the path and is shot in the correct angle it WILL travel the path. Expectations were formed on your understanding of how things would interact, not simply by the very (often binnary) ruleset given to you.\n\nThis game has nothing to do with XCOM besides the skin and that both are a Turned based strategy, their fundemantal game design is different and as such it fails to be an XCOM game.\n\nWhy is it a bad game even on its own terms?\n\nAs said, it plays like a board game would, which can be fine, I like board games...\nIt plays like a bad board game.\nA board game will give the player a defined set of rules the player has to adapt to in order to overcome a certain problem. Almost any board game ever will be forced to fall back to the concept of luck as certainty on everything will become boring.\nBut the job of any good game is to give the player a multitude of meaningful obtions for allow him to minize the randomness of the dicethrow to such a level that he can confidently predict the outcome based on the rulest the game uses.\n\nThis game fails to do that across the board.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause just about every single thing you can do has simply has far too little actual impact on the game. Cover can either lower your chance to be hit by 20%, or 40%. Which might not sound like so little but considering that the whole game is cenetered around the concept of cover and by extension of it flanking, it means that flanking is not a nessesary move, cover simply isnt reliable as it is. Compared to other such games(Warhamer/LOTR/40k) where a wall would be a wall and it would give you 100% cover, and flanking it would give you 100% more of a chance to hit.(small cover would amount to something akin to 50%)\n\nAdd to it that just about every unit in this game has 60 to 75% aim, and the fact that the 20% and 40% is a simple reduction(not a multiplcation or such, simply: 75% is your aim, -40% is cover, 35% chance to hit. And 1 hit mostlikely means dead) and you quickly find out that hiding behind a wall has very little actual power, at which point it becomes clear that  the direction of engagment is rather a minor detail.\n\nWhat about height?\n\nWell, the game gives you a set boon for being 'above' an enemy, but do to its very simplistic nature that 'Above' is often rather wonky.\n\nAn enemy can be in 'high' cover, getting a 40% defense boon while being two floors below you(meaning you could easily shoot over their 'high' cover as it is not as tall as the object you are standing on) While you are in 'low' cover, still two floors higher.\n\nIn the end you will both have the same odds of hitting each other and even if you have 'high' cover while being on a roof, all you got is an extra 20% hit chance.\n\nDo you see the general theme? Anything and everything you do moves the hit chances up or down by such minute amounts that they really have very little impact. Throw a smoke granade(of which you got 1 per mission in early game) and you get 20% more cover for two turns. In what sitersations is a 20% shift really that important?\n\nBecause often those 20% is all you can change when it comes to winning or losing your 10 hour long campaign.\n\nThe dice throwing is also made much worse by the fact that all engagments are very small scale, while in a game like Warhamer you would throw 30 dice and 30 units, you throw 5 or 6 here, of which any can decide the whole game. The more dice the more likely things will even out to be reasonable odds, here they never do.\n\nSo, playing this game pretty much amounts to playing a extremely simple(to the extent of being almost completely binary in logic) board game that doesnt even have the curtesy to let you infulence it. It gives you a lot of strategic options but most of them will have such minor impacts on the dicethrows that the most important strategic advice for this game is 'never trigger more then one group at a time'(As implied by that, the game is also full of really bad design decisions which I won't even touch on as those are commenly complained about)\n\nBesides that it is worthy to note that big oversights were never fixed in this game even though the expansion 'fixes' it. The example being that there is no button to easily disarm all your troops so you can re-equipt things.(Which is a UI oversight and should have been patched, not an expansion feature).\n\nLook at Xenonauts, look at this and give it some thought, you'll figure out why I called this game 'simple' and a 'bad board game'.","December 5, 2013","false","122.2"," 324 of 608 people (53%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","53","324","608","7","19"

There is no question, the game is amazing. From managing your squad of soldiers, to researching new technologies there's a lot of things to do. You have to manage your base, and manage your funds. Half of the gameplay is making choices on what you should build or research next. That's also part of the fun. The combat is a lot of fun! Beat the game and play on Ironman mode with Second Wind options turned on.

The whole thing is just so well done. It manages to capture that purely addictive fun of the original X-COM, with adding crazy updated graphics and easy-to-navigate menus. This title skillfully eliminates some of the more tedious parts of the original game, and keeps only the good stuff. Team management has never been so fun.\n\nPros:\n+Hours pass by and it seems like only minutes\n+Awesome modern graphics that pretty much can run on toaster (all things considered)\n+The best parts of the original series, with all the tedious parts scrapped\n+Lots of options all around: from soldier customization to how you view the battle (minus camera options, see Cons)\n+Lots of extra DLC to keep you busy forever, and not to mention a sequal\n\nCons:\n-Compared to how well everthing else is done, the camera is terrible. You can only view from 4 different sides (8 would be nice; analogue would better - I mean whats the holdup?)\n-You cannot change the angle of the camera, either. It feels too 'top-down' for me. Needs like a 15 degree shift.\n-Lots of DLC, but then again, this translates to lots of money. They have a great product, and they know it;)\n\nFor my Steam friends: If you have not experienced the pure addictiveness of X-COM, you are missing out. At least grab this on a great sale (should be plenty considering the sequal is coming out). This game literally created its own genre.\n\nSide note: I recently also played and reviewed Xenonaughts, which is an awesome spiritual predecessor of X-COM. I would love to ultimately root for the indie underdog and say that title is the best, but unfortunately Enemy Unknown takes the cheese for best modern X-COM game.","October 6, 2015","true","20.2"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","71","10","14","4","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/andgeo/recommended/200510/","andgeo","IMT AndGeoChu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/andgeo/","170 products in account","Are you and Anime fan or a whovian? Yes? Well here is the game for you:\n\nFeaturing both England AND Japan you can now dress up your soldiers to be kawaii sugoi Doctors w/ guns!\nReferences: Guns(Doctor Who and animes feature guns!), Aliens(Doctor Who and animes feature aliens!) and of course Japan and England.\n\nJokes aside, XCOM: Enemy Unkwown is the newest sequel in a long line of strategy classics.  This time it has been simplified to make it more accessible, or at least that's what everyone says. I can't really confirm that as I haven't played the older titles. Let's see how it holds up to the legacy.\n\nVisuals:\nThe game looks very good, especially for a strategy game, however with the visual fedelity of both game and the impressive cutscenes we also have some problems due(probably due the Unreal Engine). Textures load terribly slowly even for the Unreal Engine. The frame rate also seems to suffer due to the engine, however I am not sure about that.\n\nSound:\nSound design is actually quite good. Music, sounds, voice acting and of course the general composition of those challenges some AAA movies as it reminds of Alien, and other classics.\n\nGameplay:\nAs already mentioned, gameplay is quite simpe. Now, don't get me wrong XCOM is one of those game that is easy to grasp but you WILL get anal probed trying to master it. As it is a standart TBS you move your soldiers in your turn and get #rekt when the enemies turn comes. You have equipment, a small set of skills and different weapons to fight the ET threat. All quite standart but fan. Maybe you have already guessed but difficulty is kind of a thing in this game. Like in BF3 it's also quite weird. Basicly a "difficult mission" can range from "stomping enemies to the ground" to actually "a bit diffucult", then we have "very difficult missions" that can again range from "this makes me sweat a tiny bit" to "oh my god where do those elite mutons come from?". I would recommend to pick the easy difficulty for unexperienced players, normal for TBS veterans and normal+ for XCOM veterans.\n\nPlayability:\nThis games biggest problems are it's bugs and the aggro-system.\nYou have multiple game breaking bugs that can scramble saves, block your turn(good luck if you haven't saved), etc. And also quite a few glitches.\nWhat I mean by "aggro-system" is the moment in-game where you encounter enemies. That can be random, not only will saving at the beginning of a mission not mean that the enemies come from the same directions(which can be both good and bad), some times you will just be overwhelmed by enemies that throw themselves at you from nowhere.\n\nFinal Verdict:\nA fun game when it isn't frustrating as hell. Play this if you are a fan of the originals and want a lighter version, or if you want to get into the genre. I would say that it takes some influence from Starcraft 2, so maybe if you like a combination of SC2s style and a TBS with a faster pacing in a "Battleground: Earth" atmosphere then buy this.","October 26, 2014","true","35.0"," 20 of 33 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","20","33","0","2"

The game can often suffer from the 'victory lap' syndrome, where the last half of the game is just you slaughtering everything in your path and building your team for the final mission.\n\n3.)

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/AerialMaverick/recommended/200510/","AerialMaverick","Disease Mongering","http://steamcommunity.com/id/AerialMaverick/","208 products in account","Strategy games not your kind of thing? This game will change your mind. It's an extremely fun turn-based strategy game with a cool cinematic action cam (that you can disable if you don't like that sort of thing or if you want to speed up the gameplay a bit). There is also a little bit of "base management", where you decide how things operate at your HQ. It fits into the larger theme of this game where choices have consequences. While the game can be challenging, it is definitely not hard to learn. Throughout my entire playing, I never got bored of it because as you progress throughout the game, you get new weapons, new enemies, new abilities, etc. and have to adjust your tactics correspondingly. I only have the base game and no DLC, and I've barely touched the multiplayer (only played a minute or two before I remembered I had to go to work, this game is that addicting!), and I would still nonetheless highly recommend it. I heard the Enemy Within DLC adds a lot to the game.\n\nSome minor issues I have with this game is that the user interface seems to be designed with consoles in mind. The camera control is a bit wonky, especially when the camera is backed up against the edge of the map or it's really high up. You can pivot your camera 90 degrees but this only allows 4 different rotations of the camera. Since XCOM 2 is being designed with a focus on PC, these shouldn't be a problem. The text is too big, and generally this isn't a problem UNTIL information boxes that can't fit all the text have it slowly auto-scroll down after a time limit (and they don't let you scroll yourself). Also, another problem with the large text info boxes is that they sometimes get in the way "free-aiming". Things like grenades, rockets, and Rift. An example would be this picture:\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=599103439\nYou can't see the blue mouse arrow but it is approximately in the center of the circle. Unfortunately, that's overlapping with the text box. Not just that, but "free-aiming" can get very difficult to control some times. My recommendation is to just move the mouse slowly.\n\nSometimes you can't see how my red health bars enemies when you're selecting a(n) enemy to fire at and they list hit chance and crit chance. Can be a minor annoyance when you're trying to select the enemy with the most HP to shoot at, or the least or just any certain amount.\n\nTrying to finely control elevation can be difficult. I'd say 99% of the time the higher you are, the better (unless doorway arch is blocking your view), but at times I can either choose a fairly low elevation to hover at with my Archangel or Hover SHIV, or go around to the very top of the building (so that you're standing on or hovering above the ceiling), which is definitely not what I want.\n\nSelecting teammates who are hovering through clicking on them can be quite difficult (i.e. Archangel armor or Hover SHIV)\n\nThere also seems to be the rare line-of-sight issue, where you clearly have a direct shot at your enemy but the game doesn't think so, see these 2 pics:\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=597358696\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=599103455\n\nAlso, sometimes this game tabs out and switches to my desktop. Not much of a problem because I can switch it back but hopefully this gets fixed in XCOM 2.\n\nNot many people seem to play the multiplayer :(\n\nI wish there was a way to "un-equip all" soldiers so that I wouldn't have to search through my barracks to find who had that last SCOPE or plasma pistol, or whatever piece of gear. I heard this got fixed in Enemy Within though.","January 12","true","78.6"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

The battles are grid-style, turn-based, squad-based-strategy-RPG in nature.  And the gameplay that doesn't occur during the battles, like base management and the like, is very captivating and fun.  That adds up to a great all around experience of a hybrid strategy/RPG/management game.\n\nPut simply, this is a masterfully crafted game.  It has many elements of many styles of games, and the developers did a great job finding the perfect mosaic of the concepts.  The battles are strategic, challenging, and have just the right amount of luck based influence.  The meta-game action between battles keeps you engaged and always trying to reach that next upgrade— this makes it impossible to stop playing sometimes. It can be that addictive.\n\nI suppose XCOM: Enemy Unknown isn't really that innovative, but something about it just feels very fresh and different.  There are many games out there that produce a similar experience, but not many can achieve a level of quality this does.  Any fans of strategic, tactical, RPG-ish, managerial type games should check out this game.\n\nFollow my curation page to see more of my recommendations!","November 18, 2013","true","73.6"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","0"

Now, first off, this is not Real-Time Strategy, this is Turn-Based Strategy, and the only previous experience I had with such titles was tabletop games, and Pokemon. So I gave it a shot.\n\nThe game is set during the begining of a war with extraterrestrial beings. You are made Commander of the Extraterrestrial Combat Unit, XCOM for short and lead a global effort to push back the invasion. With a Council overseeing you, and people being abducted every day, this is no easy task.\n\nHow do you stop the alien menace? The gameplay is mainly divided into two parts: all of the gameplay that happens at the base (i.e. sending air support, investigating alien technology, changing your soldiers' names and looks, promoting soldiers, choosing countries to support, and expanding your base) and the gameplay that takes place in the battlefield, with your international squad of customized elite soldiers (i.e. moving them, shooting at aliens, recovering resources, saving civilians caught in the cross-fire). Both parts are incredibly well done and very fun to play.\n\nNow, when I say elite soldiers you might think this is easy, but make no mistake, this game is unforgiving, sometimes to ridiculous extents in higher difficulties. It should prove a challenge to beat the game even on Normal, as countries stop giving you their support and the world crumbles around you. And, as it is no longer common in most AAA games, death really does matter in this game. Do you have a Sniper Major who you spent hours costumizing, giving medals to, promoting and always saves your team? One lucky shot by the enemy and you have him no longer.\n\nIf you like intelligent, highly customizable, hard but enjoyable games this one is for you.\n\nAnd don't even get me started on how good the DLC is.","June 28, 2014","true","83.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Turn-based grid tactical battles, along with a more meta overview of your headquarter operations, provides rollercoaster campaigns where you will inevitably bond and part with your highly customizable squaddies.\n\nThe reason I state high replayability is due to:\n- Varying difficulty levels,\n- "Second Wave" options which change mechanics for drastically different strategizing (e.g. lower health= lower dmg, higher crit chances, more random damage)\n- FANTASTIC DLC/Expansion: Enemy Within.\n- Popular mod titled "The Long War" which adds ridiculous amounts of brand new content for a longer and harder campaign when you've exhausted the base game+expansion.\n- Great community to discuss strategies and share mods\n\nA succesful campaign in the base game will likely take over 10 hours, but you will typically not succeed on your very first try.

They're going to succeed, unless you, the player, stops them. The player takes over the role of The Commander of XCOM, a last-ditch international cooperative force of the best of the best of humanity's soldiers, scientists, engineers, and pilots. Your squads of soldiers will be deployed on missions to recover alien technology, defeat alien terror attacks, and uncover the mystery of the invasion in hopes of ultimately thwarting it. This side of the game occurs on a turn-based tactical combat layer that will be familiar to those of you who've played the original, or even games like Final Fantasy Tactics and the like. For a good chunk of the game, the aliens have better guns than you and are often statistically superior, so your soldiers must make good use of cover and positioning to overcome that challenge.\n\nThe rest of the game (research technology, training soldiers, building equipment/facilities, managing aircraft) occurs on a base management strategy layer. It's a fairly light take as far as management games go, but it gets the job done, and there are multiple ways to go about things. You need to deploy your squads, aircraft, and launch satellites in such a way as to minimize global panic and keep your benefactors (countries) on your side\n\nOne of the best parts about XCOM is that it mirrored facets of the original well: the game can be deadly. You can lose your campaign, and then boom, game over, the aliens won. A tactical battle can quickly go awry, resulting in you losing your top squad of soldiers and forcing you to field newbies once more. This terror is best exemplified in the game's Ironman Mode, which only allows a single autosave file, and the game autosaves with every single turn. Lose the campaign, and your save is deleted. Combine that with one of the harder difficulties (Classic or Impossible), and difficulty junkies will surely get their fill.\n\nAll in all one of the best strategy games to come out in the past decade. The expansion (Enemy Within) and other DLC (Slingshot) add more missions and options to the game in a great way. A must buy for tactical/strategy lovers and a great "first strategy" game for newcomers, though they may want to start on Easy or Normal.","February 27","true","88.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Due to recent extraterrestrial attacks, the XCOM Project has been activated and you have been appointed as its commander.  Your duties include directing the initiative's research, sending order to the engineering department, selecting and hiring the best soldiers for the job, and commanding said soldiers in battle.  You'll also be building and modifying satellites and aircraft to provide intel and defense against the alien threat as well.\n\nAs the war progresses, the alien invasion forces will become increasingly dangerous.  New alien types with more advanced equipment and abilities will show up throughout the war to catch XCOM offguard.  Fortunately, this is where your research department tips the scales in your favor.  After eliminating an enemy threat you will acquire alien materials and corpses that your scientists will be able to study.  Common results from these studies include new gear options for your soldiers, additional aircraft and air-based weaponry, new facilities to build in your base, and more that will further your cause.  I was always very excited when my research resulted in a new piece of gear based on alien tech that was significantly more efficient than what I had previously used.\n\nIn addition to improvements to their gear, your soldiers will gain promotions as they acquire experience in combat.  Each of the four classes has a unique tech three that they will progress down as you see fit.  Each rank allows you to choose one of two options that will offer new abilities to use or passive buffs to the unit's overall efficiency.  One Heavy soldier may be built around specializing with his rocket launcher, another might be entirely focused on maximizing their machine  gun capabilities, and a third might have a combination skills from both skill lines.\n\nThere are two other aspects of XCOM that I feel need to be mentioned in addition to the standard mechanics: Second Wave and Long War.  Second Wave is a menu full of options that is unlocked after having completed the game once.  These drastically change the mechanics of the game and include changes such as a semi-randomized skill tree for your units where one, or potentially both, of their options for a particular rank offer skills that are not usually allowed to that profession.  For example, you might have an Assault trooper who has an advanced talent with medicine that is capable of healing their allies for significantly more health, an ability that is usually Support-only.\n\nLong War, on the other hand, is an unofficial mod created by players who saw the opportunity to futher improve an already great game.  Though there are plenty of mods out there, none that I have seen can come close to comparing to the ambition shown in Long War.  I won't go into the details here but I find that it improves almost every aspect of the game for me.  If you're interested, read more on it here:    http://www.nexusmods.com/xcom/mods/88/?\n\nThere are very few people that I wouldn't recommend this game to.  The variety of difficulty options makes it an enjoyable game whether you're a more casual player of if you're a hardcore masochist (I'm looking at you Impossible/Ironman).  The mechanics are great, the atmosphere is fantastic, and everyone who I've spoken to who has played has had numerous stories to share that are a lot of fun to hear.  Just remember, you'll be losing a lot of soldier that you've customized grown attached to.\n\nNow stop reading and save the world from the alien menace, Commander!","January 16","true","129.8"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

EU is capable of encapsulating all things that i loved about the original UFO Defense. Tension, fear, and complex choices are the back bone of this genre. While the game does have some cracks in the facade its mostly forgivable. Its obvious that some of the mechanics were rushed, some things were skipped, left out, deleted at the last minute, but this is common in a world of deadlines and shareholders.

Apakah anda sudah siap untuk kehilangan waif-..pasukan karena satu keputusan yang salah?\n\nApa anda mau mencoba bermain catur dengan latar 3D Map dimana bidak nya adalah Pasukan Khusus dan Alien?\nThis is your game.\n\nKelebihan :\nStrategy yang menantang\nGrafik yang ciamik\nMembuat frustasi\nCustomisasi yang luas\nMap yang strategis\nAtmoshphere yang menghipnotis\n\nKekurangan :\nStory terlalu simpel dan sangat berpotensi untuk di perluas\nMap terkadang repetitive/berulang-ulang\nPlayer agak terbatas pada cerita\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nAPA SIH XCOM ENEMY UNKNOWN?XCOM : EU adalah Turn-based Strategy game(Strategy dengan sistem permainan yang bergantian) yang di rilis 2KGames dimana kita mengambil peran sebagai Komandan organisasi gabungan antar negara yang bernama XCOM, dalam usaha untuk menangkal Invasi Alien ke bumi.\n\nDi sini selain memimpin pasukan khusus di setiap misi nya, player juga mengurus segala kepentingan di markas mulai dari Riset untuk peningkatan prajurit/Pesawat tempur sampai urusan pembangunan di dalam markas XCOM.GRAFIK DAN SOUNDXCOM Enemy Unknown berbasis Unreal Engine 3 yang mana untuk game genre strategy Engine semacam ini sangat memuaskan mata.\nEfek suara mulai dari Senjata, Voice-over, sampai backsound sangat memanjakan telinga. Atmosphere yang tercipta memberi sumbangan besar untuk game ini.\n\nBahkan di awal cerita dan beberapa lokasi, atmoshpere nya bisa membuat player berfikir 2x untuk memainkan game ini malam hari.STORYPada dasarnya story di XCOM EU hanyalah moving timeline. Tapi disini kita akan terasa membangun cerita kita disini, melatih pasukan dan bertempur bersama mereka membuat sensasi tersendiri yang akan(secara pasif) berhubungan di akhir cerita GAMEPLAYDengan menjadi Komandan/Pemimpin dari Proyek XCOM ini player harus menjaga agar Teror Alien di bumi(10 Negara?) tidak berkembang. Player secara garis besar akan dapat/harus:\n- Memimpin Markas dan Pasukan khusus di tiap Misi\n- Melakukan Riset Teknologi\n- Melakukan Pembangunan\n\nMission\nUntuk misi, player akan melakukan Scan di Ruang Control Utama untuk melacak lokasi UFO atau menunggu laporan Penculikan oleh Alien. Setelah menemukan atau mendapat laporan maka Player akan mengirim Skyranger ke lokasi yang bersangkutan. TETAPI, untuk misi penculikan player hanya boleh memilih 1 dari setiap 3 Laporan Penculikan yang ada yang berarti Player harus memilih dengan tepat agar Teror tetap terkendali karena kalau sampai Teror di suatu negara melewati batas maka Negara tersebut akan mengundurkan diri dari Proyek XCOM yang artinya akan mempersulit player karena pendapatan untuk kebutuhan XCOM akan berkurang.\n\nRiset/Research\nPlayer harus melakukan riset agar dapat menyamai atau bahkan menandingi Teknologi Alien. Mulai dari melakukan Autopsy mayat Alien, Menciptakan Senapan Plasma sampai membangun Jet berteknologi Alien sangat dibutuhkan demi menandingi kemampuan dan kemajuan teknologi Alien.\n\nPembangunan\nMembangun Markas XCOM menjadi Markas Organisasi paling maju sepanjang sejarah manusia adalah hal yang menyenangkan dan membuat frustasi. Dengan tampilan "Rumah Semut" yang dapat zoom-in/zoom-out player seakan melihat kehidupan kecil yang sedang berjuang melawan kehancuran mereka dari balik kaca.\nSelain pembangunan ruangan dan kebutuhan tenaga, player juga dapat(diharuskan) membangun Satelite agar dapat memantau tiap negara yang masih berdiri dan dalam perlindungan XCOM.CustomizationLagi, untuk game yang bergenre strategy XCOM EU mempunyai Customisasi yang sangat luas. player bisa mengubah nama, suara, ras, rambut, warna armor yang digunakan pasukan secara individual. In My Opinion ini sangat sangat membuat kita semakin masuk jauh ke dalam dunia XCOM EU. Bayangkan, membuat karakter seperti teman/pacar lalu di suatu misi mereka jadi makanan Alien? yup, Galau Confirmed~.Final Verdict8/10\n\nUntuk kamu yang suka tantangan dan khususnya strategy games cepet-cepet beli game ini. Worth every receh yang ada di celengan ayam kamu.\n\nFootnote: Ini adalah review pertama OP dengan bahasa Indonesia, maaf bila ada percampuran bahasa yang baku dan tidak baku. Segala masukan dan saran akan sangat di hargai bagi OP yang masih berkembang ini.\nSebenernya gak ngerti juga kenapa ada yang mau baca sampe bawah sini, tapi terima kasih xD\n\nMau diskusi tentang game  atau Review ini? silahkan ketik REG (spasi) Libiral *plak*","January 30","true","28.2"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","0"

Strategy games apart from sims are far and few between, especially made by AAA studios and publishers. This game was no different, as it took a very long time to get developed since the publisher originally wanted to make it a first person shooter.\n\nInstead what we got is a delightful return to form for the series. XCom Enemy Unknown is a game where you play as the commander of a team that specializes in stopping an alien invasion of the planet Earth. The game is a turn based strategy game and heavy in things like cover and approaching carefully. Your squad of soldiers likewise is heavily customizeable, and as you complete more missions they grow identities of their own.\n\nWhat amuses me is how the game likewise punishes you for failure. There's a setting in the game called "Ironman" mode which disables quicksaving. What this does is force you to either restart an entire mission from the start, or bite the bullet and move on if one of your favorite squad members dies. Because you can only level up soldiers by completing missions, this mode makes you play extra carefully so you can get everyone out alive.\n\nEnemy Unknown is a refreshing change of pace from the nonstop first person shooters we get every few months. A title that injects a little humanity into an otherwise drab and faceless genre. Where your unwilling to make redshirts out of your pawns.","June 13, 2013","true","14.7"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/adamcurran/recommended/200510/","adamcurran","Adam","http://steamcommunity.com/id/adamcurran/","58 products in account","A great turn-based strategy game with RPG elements. There are many aspects I like about this game, including the combat mechanics; although the game can occasionally seem unfair (how could I miss with 80% hit chance?), it is actually a well-thought out system that works very well for the most part. I like how there are two different play modes - one is the on ground combat, and the other is managing your base. Think of the management aspect like a simplified Civ game. You are responsible for hiring scientists and engineers, building specific rooms, managing finances, hiring soldiers, deciding which soldiers to genetically modify, to name but a few. I also like the way each solider type (heavy, assault, support, and sniper) have their own tech trees. They are slightly limited, but enough to keep it interesting. The expansion adds plenty of content, such as new missions, weapons, and enemies.\n\nNegatives are fairly minor. I feel there could have been more environment types (they get very stale after a while). Animations are sometimes a bit off, not enough to ruin the flow of the game, but they are noticeable. There is one enemy where their turn takes way too long, and can be irritating to wait for it to finish, especially when you are looking to load to a previous save.\n\nOverall, a fantastic turn-based strategy game. Certainly one of my favourite stratey games. If you are late to the game like I was and enjoying good strategy, I recommend buying this ASAP.","April 10","true","81.5"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","1"

They are responsible for a vast amount of Mac ports, from Borderlands and Deus Ex: Human Revolution to Lego Batman and Worms 3D. The release of the Linux port of XCOM: Enemy Unknown is their first Linux release to date. Feral Interactive's Linux native port stands up well and plays smoothly at the highest settings. This is a very high-quality port and showcases the great work that Feral do. Expext more high quality Linux ports from them!\n\n\nNow more about the game:\nIt's been years since I've played the original XCOM on my 386 computer, but I still vividly remember the hours of fun I had filing my team out of our landing craft to do battle with the alien hordes.\n\nWhile my memory of the specifics of the classic XCOM are a bit hazy, I can tell you that all the major elements that I remember are fully intact in XCOM: Enemy Unknown (XEU). You get to do loads of research between missions, you can scramble jets to intercept UFOs and most of all, you get to send your team all over the world in turn-based combat with the aliens in your patient quest for new technology.\n\nDespite the similarities to the original, it is immediately apparent that a lot of thought and polish went into the development of this new game.\n\n--Your teammates can go up in rank as they gain more experience. Best of all, more experience means more abilities, but even this is not linear as you are often stuck with a choice of abilities, both almost equally tempting.\n\n--Prepare to die a lot, but the Soldier Memorial adds a nice touch and encourages you to be more careful with your strategy to prevent further losses.\n\n--Being able to view the "anthill" of your base and excavate new areas gives you a great deal of satisfaction between missions.\n\n--There are short load screens, but they are integrated so well that you hardly even notice them (in particular the spacecraft cinematic when you fly to or from an engagement).\n\n--Having people at headquarters that actually talk to you reminds me a bit of the advisors in the Civilization games.\n\n--But perhaps some of my favorite things about XEU, are the global threat alerts and council meetings. Through both of these, you really feel like you are part of a global effort to defeat the aliens, not just America vs the Aliens. As you'll soon find out, aiding other countries is crucial to getting ahead and keeping the aliens at bay.\n\nAs for negatives, I really have nothing but a nitpicking. The graphics are more practical than they are pretty. You won't be ooh-ing and aah-ing at anything, but at least you'll never mistake an alien for a pile of rubble.\n\nOne final note, although the game is rated "M", my experience (about 5-6 hours worth) has been absolute "E", minus a little animated green goo and blood. There is an option to turn off "squad language" which is where I imagine the bad language and the "M" rating lie. So parents should have no problem with having their kids play this game if it is set up properly.\n\nIn an age where some developers seem to favor style over substance, it's nice to see a game that remembers its roots. I've put hundreds of hours into "graphically bland" games like Civilization, the original XCOM and Final Fantasy Tactics. I foresee that I'll be putting quite a bit of time into this game as well.\n\nA must play/buy for all Linux gamers!","June 22, 2014","true","16.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It's a challenging, engaging game, no doubt about it. It's easy to get hyped up on XCOM 2 (ETA: less than a month as of review), but this game has charm. Sure, stuff like forced failure in the form of abductions and unusual glitches mean the game isn't perfect. But no game is.\n\nIt's hard to describe the feeling I get from playing XCOM, because it is like no other game I've played. It's not forgiving. RNG will get in the way every day. Your soldiers will die. You will cry. But you will get up, and try again. You will get better, and try again. And you will strike at increasingly higher difficulties, hopefully achieving the venerable I/I run. The fact that this game pulls no punches means that every action, every death, and most of all, every victory, means something.\n\nThey've digged up an old game from the grave. That means there's changes from the good old UFO days. People that liked the old UFO games may not like this one. It definitely changes a lot. There's no more TUs. Inventories are streamlined. You can only have one base.\n\nBut I played the old UFO, and I loved it to bits. I played this reboot, and I loved it to bits. So it's not correct to say that nobody who played the UFO games will like this one, because I did. For old veterans of the franchise and newcomers alike, I must wholeheartedly recommend.","January 12","true","723.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Half of the game is spent planning, researching and building in the X-COM HQ and the rest is spent out on the field. However neither fells like a gimmick on the other. In the base you'll feel either excited to use your new tech, or terrified that you could lose more soldiers. In the field you'll long for the time when you can get back to base hopefully with a full squad. Since mission are, for the most part randomly generated it has a huge replay value. While the story is a little lack luster there are some good moral moments and the gameplay makes up for it.","March 16, 2014","true","165.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

I rate games on several factors: music, sound effects, graphics/art style, game play, difficulty options, learning, replayability, stakes, and story/dialogue. I then weigh that to the price of the game.\n\nThe story is so compelling and something I absolutely love. Earth is under alien invasion. In order to face the threat, the forces of Earth ally. There's many places that need help, and you cannot pick all of them. Hopefully you can gather knowledge to further your tech to aid in the war. I love how the US works with China and Russia and other countries.\n\nThe music of Mass Effect reminds me of the music from XCOM. That's one reason why I liked Mass Effect and why I LOVE XCOM. This ties into the stakes. The stakes are high! Alien invasion. There's only one planet. And the music expresses how this is a war for survival. And I felt it. No matter what there will be casualties.\n\nStakes ties into the story and difficulty. The planet is under attack! And if you choose the ironman difficulty. If someone dies, they're dead. So every choice you make matters, and may or may not result in a injured or killed squadmate. Or a failed mission.\n\nThere's a lot of learning in this game. I've played it on Ironman. And I have started the game over, a dozen or so times.\n\nThe graphics didn't blow me away. But the art choices did. The lighted lines of the alien canisters to the look of a sectoid or muton. The color pallete of a soft blue with black and white gives a futuristic vibe. And the UI is quite intuitive. There's personality! The skyhawk has a no sectoid paint on it.\n\nGameplay is where the game really shines! I love tactical strategy based games. Final Fantasy Tactics, Fire Emblem, Shining Force, Shadowrun, etc. And this game has it. Combat will take a long time. Each movement will be calculated. Is there enough cover? Can I flank without getting flanked? How much will moving to this spot increase/decrase my to hit %?\n\nReplayability. The game has it. You can beat it one way, maybe following a specific strategy or losing a few council members. Or you can make an attempt at not losing any members or only using a specific class. I've played this game so much and everyone I've told about it has loved it. I'm sure you will too!","December 17, 2015","true","303.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Never would I envision another game would barge in and join this prestigious list of games. Out of nowhere, comes XCOM: Enemy Unknown.\n\nXCOM: Enemy Unknown is a turn based tactical warfare game where you command a squad of soldiers against aliens (classic). Expectations are set for you as commander to save human civilization and rid of the invading species. Right at the start, the game flung you into the mix of things with a steep learning curve. On the commanding side, you have to maintain panic levels that keep your ally countries to fund your XCOM project which is your main source of income. If you fail, they leave the XCOM project forever and you get zero funding from them onwards. The income is used to upgrade your base, weapons, and other perks. On the battlefield, keeping your squad members alive is crucial. The game runs on perma-death. If a squad member dies, he dies for good. After that, he can only be selected in the memorial and you can lookup on which mission he perished. Of course you can hire a new soldier but losing your best soldier on the field doesn’t feel good right. During combat, the way you inflict damage to your opponents is percentage based and relies heavily on positioning as well as flanking. Ever missed a 98%  point blank shot? Hell yeah. But when you hit that crucial 9% shot that saves your team from total annihilation. A sigh of relief. You will never have the calmness to expand your base as the game throws problems one after another at you. The brutal yet realistic nature of the game brings a satisfying gaming experience.\n\nAs mentioned, the game excels in turn based combat. It is realistic as it does not provide you an easy way out of sticky situations. An easy mission can be brutally difficult if patience is not taken into consideration. Charging into a swarm of enemies almost guarantees a death or two. What makes this game better is soldiers having distinct classes when ranking up. Each class will have their own skill tree. With each soldiers’ rank up, a skill can be selected between two choices to specialize the unit. You can choose having higher defense to soak up damage for your allies as a vanguard or increased critical chance while close up to the enemy to be that devastating spearhead your team desperately needs. Your team composition is solely up to you. Moreover, the underlying tension when in base or out in the field on uncertainties of what will happen next will keep you on your toes. I’ve spent hours in the game calculating my every movement, in which I thought I only spent minutes. This just signifies how immersive this game truly is. However, XCOM Enemy Unknown has its fair share of problems. The first noticeable flaw is graphical glitches. I saw my Japanese sniper nicknamed ‘Headshot’ charge up his plasma rifle to land a headshot while the plasma beam pierces through a friendly unit, a car, a wall AND then the alien’s head. In addition, switching elevation level in the game can be frustrating at times as layers of flooring are hard to navigate properly. The second issue is the random map generator. There is a limited pool of maps that is chosen for each mission and when you play a lot, you start to notice maps reoccurring, just from different angles where you start the mission from. The suburbs of USA look exactly the same as the that from India. Nevertheless, these imperfections don’t create much of an issue for an extremely flawless game, literally at 98%. With XCOM 2 just out, I might just be seduced into purchasing it seeing how good the prequel, XCOM: Enemy Unknown is.\n\nPros:\n- In depth turn based tactical combat\n- Realistic and unforgiving in nature\n- Customizable and personalized team composition with plentiful options\n- Tension loaded experience\n\nCons:\n- Constant graphical glitches\n- Repeating maps used for missions in different parts of the world\n\nRating: 9.8/10\n(What? I’m obsessed with 9 and 8 together in this game, 98% sure)","February 5","true","27.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I'm glad I gave it a chance because this is one of the few single-player games I've finished and thouroughly enjoyed.\n\nThis game is definitely about adaptation; you must constantly be aware of positioning, how skills interplay with one another, and learning (painfully) what does and doesn't work against certain alien types.\n\nThe story isn't terribly engrossing. You progress through the story by researching alien technology and integrating it into your own arsenal. What makes it so much fun is naming all the characters after your friends, and then trying like hell not to get them killed. Thank god for the save/reload function, as I used it far more often than I probably should have.\n\nI enjoy turn-based games, and this one doesn't have a ridiculously high learning curve--anyone can play on normal and with some basic trial-and-error, figure out a way to beat the game. However, the one thing I didn't understand at the beginning, and wish I would have known earlier on is: BUILD SATTELITES. BUILD UPLINKS. Finished? BUILD SOME MORE.\n\nIf you enjoy tactical, turn-based games, and you haven't given XCOM a try, I highly recommended it.

But when you put Firaxis behind the wheel, the geniuses behind Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri, you're bound to have a success!! And XCOM: Enemy Unknown is so much more than that! What really gets you into the game is not the awesome and compelling storyline, or the brilliant combat and cover system, or the tons of upgrades and research, or the customizability of your entire squad, but the actual remake of a game that has been with me since my childhood days and they really nailed it perfectly! From brilliant kill cams to riveting action cut-scenes as your soldiers moves from cover or flanks an enemy to barely dodge an incoming plasma blast; this game is as perfect as you'll get to any other reboot. It is extremely forgiving to newcomers of the XCOM series and/or turn-based strategies so if this is your first time then look no further, you'll have one hell of a fun ride! I must admit though that near the end, 30 hours or so in, it did start to get a bit repetitive with the alien ships and panic missions, but the game happened to end not even an hour afterwards with the final mission so I must admit this was perfectly thought out. Not too long, nor too short, and definitely worth every cent and second spent on the game. A thoroughly and unforgettable experience!","October 25, 2013","true","32.6"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

It's extremely well polished from a graphics POV and the music score does well at driving your emotions depending on what you're doing.  While at home base there's a pulse pounding track running to make you feel lke you're doing something important.

You had a city to build bases in and determine your coverage area versus in EU, you just pick a country for your home base and then build satellites to cover the rest. It's a strategy element I did miss even after I stopped playing apoc over a decade ago.\nSecond, when you get into the harder difficulty levels (e.g. Impossible), it can take a lot of attempts to get your game moving forward.

Even after I've played through this game, I continue to come back and play it, even months between playthroughs. It is kinda glitchy with a mouse and keyboard, I'm not sure if these get fixed with the controller or not. Its a hard game though, if you dont want to try, dont play XCOM. You have to try, you have to think you cant just rush a turn, the game will punish you for it.\n\nThe one thing that is infuriating with the game, is the game is true with its percentages. 99% is NOT a garentee. You have a 1% chance to miss. Its possible. I cant tell you the amount of times iv'e had a 99% hit chance, and missed, leading me to lose the game or something. Of course, this happens about 1/100 times. So its not super common, but its definatly clear that just cause your percentage chance to hit is high, doesnt garentee the hit. This fact might ruin the game for some people.","February 23, 2015","true","158.6"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Sure, it is turn-based combat and if you really tried, you can find a few faults with it, but the gameplay is tight, fun, brings across the combat from what I know of the original xcom very well and is very engaging and rewarding.\n\nYou play as the commander of the XCOM project. An organisation built to defend earth from the encroaching threat of alien invasion. In the base you arrange for a whole host of things to happen; You sort out your soldiers (hiring, dismissing, equipping, promoting, skill selection, customisation etc), your research projects to get better stuff, interrogations of captives, your base expansions, building and improving of equipment, taking requests from other Countries, selling alien objects, sending up satelites etc etc. So basically, you do lots of stuff. It's deep, engaging and you honestly do end up getting absorbed in everything which all ties up nicely and affects your soldiers in the field.\n\nThe field operations are turn based assaults, rescues, area securing and other various missions (depending on dlc or not) which take place in different areas which you do get to see a few times, but are infrequent enough and varied enough to still be interesting. The aliens you fight are nicely varied and gradually get more difficult as the game progresses and the whole thing has a nice tie-in with the base gameplay. You capture aliens, alloys, meld (dlc) and sometimes even soldier units in the field, then use those in the base to make more stuff, which then helps in the field next time. It's smooth, intuitive and really engaging.\n\nThere are flaws, naturally. Sometimes some of the abilities seem a little abstracted from the map geometry and units can sometimes see or even shoot through walls at times. The randomness of the ways you can get resources can be a limitation if you're out of funds for this month and seriously need to start building more stuff, but it does not affect gameplay negatively to a huge extent.\n\nOverall, XCOM: Enemy Unknown is a fantastic game, with a good story, immersive gameplay and great mechanics. It is fun and interesting, which in my book, is a big plus these days!","November 29, 2013","true","157.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

I also used to be a person who did not like the idea of turn based strategy games. Then I tried xcom, and fell in love with this game so much that when I got a computer I bought it on Steam too. What makes this game so good in my opinion? This game takes time to learn. You will make mistakes and lose. When you do not allow yourself to make the same mistakes and learn from them, the more you play, the better you will get. What I like most about xcom is the fact that when I first started this game, I was clueless. This is my first turn based strategy game. As I continued to play xcom, I became better and was able to finally beat classic difficulty with ironman mode enabled. This game requires you to make hard choices that are not always clear. That is why I like this game so much. It requires you to think about every choice you make in the base management side, and in the turn based tactical combat side. Every choice you make in base management has an upside and downside. The combat layer also has hard choices as well, requiring you to adapt and have backup plans, should your initial plan fail. Trust me, you will learn to hate this game and love it at the same time. The tutorial does a nice job of teaching you the basics, but it does not teach you some of the more unorthodox strategies that you have to learn on your own, or learn it from other players. Even though this game does have some bug issues from time to time, the main reason you will learn to like this game is simple. It will never be exactly the same twice. EVER. My main advice to new players or first time players of xcom, is to take your time. Patience and planning ahead will always be your most deadly weapon in this game. I hope that anyone reading this can give this game a chance as I did. I can honestly say that I do not regret playing this game one bit. If you like turn based strategy games, this game will give you a run for your money.","July 26, 2013","true","403.6"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

(The Schmaltzy Cynic)","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Brian_Colfxire/","468 products in account","Before I had played XCOM, I always thought it was a rogue-lite that lasts 10+ hours before you fail. The difficulty of XCOM had always dissuaded me from trying, which I think more people would love the game if they knew the challenge can be manageable.\n\nHowever, and this is said after I've finished a 19-hr Normal game and tried 15-hr of Classic Mode (with modifiers like ironman), I don't always think the game is fair with its difficulty. It can be very unfair with broken mechanics,  UI/camera problems and a steep difficulty spike from Normal to Classic.\n\nI won't say the unfairness ruins the game because I want the challenge, but they are all issues. My ideal solution of a difficulty is one that has the AI behavior of Classic but the leeway you have in Normal mode. (Something I've heard is possible with the Long War mod.)\n\nAn Important Note\nI do own the complete edition of XCOM, so while I have Enemy Within I have not played it.  I wanted to evaluate the merits of Enemy Unknown (around 30 hrs) before I evaluated what EW adds to EU.\n\nAlso, one note about the cosmetics'/council-missions DLC: Buy them ONLY if you care for customizing your characters but do not buy them individually (either buy the base-game or complete pack).\n\nWhat the Game Does Right\nWhat Firaxis does considerably well is provide a more streamlined, accessible game for a hardcore niche title. I have tried XCOM: UFO Defense long ago, so I have experienced what the old games demanded of the player.\n\nSo while I see how the base management, item-inventory and squad-sizes are less demanding, I think the game's focus on squad-tactics, resource-management and the action of XCOM makes for a fun game in its own right.\n\nThe best way I can describe the game is that it's a Civilization's take on XCOM. (Barren on plot, heavy on gameplay and the personal-stories you can have from the gameplay.)\n\nTo my surprise, there is a considerable variety of missions--though you'll mostly get three: Exterminate, Extract and Escort--when you include the randomized council missions to keep the game refressing even after 15+ hours.\n\nNormal (Recommended) vs. Classic\nIf you are new to XCOM, I would suggest you begin at nothing lower than Normal (with saves). After your first win, you should enable no saves to keep yourself from reloading every turn. (i.e. Reloading for maximizing probabilities.)\n\nThe only worry you have in Normal is of overpowering yourself if you prioritize the base-management/squad-upgrades. You can easily take away the tension. The early-game difficulty returns after the alien base-assault when the game brings its heavier units.\n\nEasing yourself into EU is not the only reason to start at Normal. You should have no problem managing finances for the base and squad-upgrades, so you'll also learn what to prioritize. You'll also learn which autopsies and interrogations give you bonus "research points" for other research. (The research is very similar to Civ 5, except with required materials for study.)\n\nBasically, the normal mode is to familiarize yourself with the mechanics and the game's glossary of enemies, the armory, and bonuses.\n\nClassic Mode is where most would say the true game is found. Enemy behaviors are greatly improved--Thin Men spit acid, Floaters actually fly up to flank you, etc.--and the early enemies are more threatening rather than being forgotten. (Like the Outsider.)\n\nYou will fail if you start in Classic, and even after familiarizing yourself on Normal you probably won't reach the Alien Base assault for a while. Even with many of the Second Wave modifiers for difficulty, the Normal setting never gets as interesting as Classic.\n\nIn order to get that far, you also have to learn the shortcomings of EU.\n\nMore Trigger Warnings than Tumblr\nAll jokes aside, the best tactic is to let the enemy spot you, not to trigger their location. It's also the first example of how EU breaks its rules for a consistent challenge.\n\nFor whatever reason, every time you spot an enemy they get to scatter freely and then attack you at the end of your turn. (Sometimes the enemy will sit still and you must trigger them.) The best solution is to either scout ahead with someone ghosted or use trackers to spot them from afar and hunker down.\n\nI don't have an issue with constant the two-second cinematic. What I do have a problem is how your units do not react similarly to spotting an enemy.\n\nAnother related issue is Overwatch. Because of the isometric camera, you have to hope that when the alien is spotted that they'll be within range. This could easily be fixed with a range-setting to make it more useful than a prayer on a battlefield.\n\nThe battlefields themselves also have issues. Sometimes the free-aiming system can be misleading when it comes to altitude. The transitioning of floors can make some encounters hard to distinguish what you can and cannot hit. And aliens can sometimes hide in the one corner in the map with one entrance.\n\nThe most obvious broken system is the aiming system of XCOM. It never feels fair for me or the aliens for how simple it is.\n\nI think the aiming calculation could be less infuriating with its hit-or-miss system. For whatever reason, a sniper-rifle is treated the same as a shotgun or assault rifle. Hit or miss with some critical chance for hits.\n\nHere's one suggestion: Instead of all guns acting the same, we personalized guns to have a certain tactic. For example, the shotgun could have a wider spread (3 tiles) with the central line-of-sight (1 tile) that does the most damage. Too far away, it'll miss completely; up close, it will do some damage which is better than missing.\n\n(Snipers could stay the same. Assault rifles, with a burst fire, could have some medium spread while heavies would have the most spread.)\n\nLastly, and a real big issue for Classic, the Recruits.  I consider them broken because if you lose your classed units, then you've lost.\n\nRecruits all start out with poor stats/equipment (aside from one Squaddie perk). They are randomly given a one of three classes AFTER they get one kill (which restricts them from using any weapon). It just adds needless padding; worse, it can end the game there.\n\nAn XCOMplimishment Despite its Flaws\nWhat I think EU succeeds in is providing a unique experience where you develop a love-hate honeymoon.\n\nIt begins all tender and carefree until those damning issues make you want to quit or to give up. In spite of those issues, they never keep you from trying over and over again. thinking, "Some day I can look over all failures by accomplishing this one thing. It will be the one thing I've done right." Then, nine-months later you find that there's a Sectoid baby. You  dispose of it, and you are left pondering where did you go wrong and what to do about it now.\n\nThen you start it all over again. (Just like Cpt. Kirk would want to be remembered.)\n\nEnemy Within review: Steam Review","February 16","true","55.2"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/taerdin/recommended/200510/","taerdin","Taerdin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/taerdin/","1226 products in account","In XCOM: Enemy Unknown players are tasked with running a military base who's sole purpose is to defend the Earth from alien attacks. The base view is presented in an ant farm style, which allows you to explore the structure of your base as though it is a living system. Unfortunately in this iteration of XCOM satellite uplinks/nexus are so vital to your success (especially on harder difficulties) that you are forced into a fairly standard base makeup. If you don't focus on getting your satellites up, you will almost certainly lose.\n\nThe main focus of the game is the battles, which on the whole are interesting and tense. Cover is vital during tactical battles, and if you do not use appropriate cover on harder difficulties you will quickly lose your valuable soldiers as often times taking one hit means death. Forcing yourself to use Iron Man difficulty or otherwise not reloading your saves is almost certainly the most interesting to play the game and means that losing a soldier is permanent. But it's this chance of permanent loss that brings so much tension and excitement to the battles. There is nothing like the joy of nailing an alien on a 25% chance shot and save a squad member's life, or the sting that comes from missing a 97% shot you thought for sure was in the bag. Soldiers rank up from battles and learn more and more abilities as they do. Successfully completing missions and killing aliens you can recover their technology in order to research it and further improve your soldiers. The visual upgrades your soldiers get from new equipment is probably one of the most appealing aspects of the game. Seeing a loved soldier move up from standard gear to become a future soldier with glowing guns and sleek armor is fantastic.\n\nUnfortunately in the battles the AI opponents do not follow the same rules as the player units until they are 'activated' by coming into field of view of your soldiers. Until they activate they are essentailly one 'unit' and will teleport around the battlefield (outside of your view usually) into positions of varying believability. For instance one time I cleared a building by killing all the sectoids within, and then my soliders heard a sound coming from the neighbouring building. As I stacked my soldiers up on the doors and prepared to breach the building they suddenly heard sounds behind them. I sent them back to the first building only to find more sectoids had teleported onto the ones that I just killed, and were no longer in the building my soldiers heard them in only two turns ago. Another case of this is when my rookie soldiers began to panic and hunker down, I once had a group of sectoids teleport in the middle of my soliders! They quickly took cover on every side of my soldiers and were flanking from so many angles that there was no chance success at all.\n\nAnother way in which the game 'cheats' is during some missions (usually 'council' missions like escorting VIPs or defusing bombs) aliens will simply drop in from the sky. They'll either drop in out of view, behind you, in perfect sniping positions, at your flank, at all of your flanks... in other words, pretty much anywhere. There is a pattern to when they drop in, but there is no warning, or rather the warning comes as they are dropping on top of you which kind of renders it useless.\n\nWhile there are certainly some problems and questionable decisions in this reboot, overall it is a very worthy successor to the original. XCOM: Enemy Unknown kind of screws up the base building by railroading you into satellite focus, and the tactical battles by cheating the rules your soldiers are forced to follow. On the other hand they enhance the experience by allowing your soldiers to learn interesting abilities when they rank up, including some interesting equipment and enemy types, and just making the game much shinier and easier to play.\n\nOverall it is clearly one of the most solid strategy games on Steam despite it's flaws. It is one of my favourites in my collection and I'm sure that will only be reinforced by Enemy Within.","November 25, 2013","true","90.2"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/flamingking/recommended/200510/","flamingking","Dothraki Horselord","http://steamcommunity.com/id/flamingking/","228 products in account","In XCOM: Enemy Unknown, the earth is gradually coming under attack from extraterrestrials seeking to kill us all. As the head of the XCOM project, a secret organization funded by nations throughout the world to fight the aliens, you manage your squad of soldiers on the ground in turn based tactics, the direction of your research labs (better armor or better weapons?), and even general base-building (Should I go with more research labs or a power generator?). Decisions, decisons.\n\nAs time goes by, the aliens will step up their offense, sending down a variety of aliens from the dreaded tank-like mutons to the spider-like zombie spawning Chryssalid. But shall you prioritize the correct research, you'll get better weapons to combat the ever-growing threat.\n\nThe combat in the game as I mentioned, is turn-based tactical, as you control a squad of 4 (at the start) performing a search/destroy mission. You soldiers level up as they perform missions and kill aliens. They can be promoted into one of 4 classes namely Assault, Support, Heavy, and Sniper. Each with their special abilities. As your men level up, you'll begin to feel for your men, each with their own unique nicknames. You could even rename them in to your friends if you like! But be careful though, if you don't get your men into cover, they will die. Alot. XCOM is an unforgiving game where emphasis is based on being aware of your surroundings and efficiently using cover.\n\nThe game is best played on Ironman mode where the game overwrites your save file with each turn you make, so if you lose your colonel, well, you can't go back in time to reverse that poor decision you made. The game is made by Firaxis, makers of Civilization series, so you can expect a top notch quality game.\n\n5/5 GOTY 2012\n\nEdit: It's even better if you could get the expansion for the game, XCOM: Enemy Within. Just released a month ago, it features a whole new variety of maps (so you won't replay the same map for the upteenth time.), more enhancements for your men featuring the power-fist wielding mech suit (to punch those darn aliens!), genetic mods for your men to become something like Captain America! And a whole new enemy faction; Exalt. These buggers want to use alien tech for world domination, akin to an evil version of XCOM. They can sabotage your base, steal your credits etc. But you can take them out later in the game.\n\nXCOM Enemy Within also mixes it up with a whole new alien resource to collect when on the ground; meld. They can be used for gene mods and building mech suits for your men. But be careful though. These things self-destruct after a certain number of turns, thus mixing up the combat! RIsk = Reward baby!\n\nXCOM ENEMY WITHIN is highly recommended for enhancing your XCOM experience! It's easily one of the best DLCs out there this past year. 5/5\n\nAs usual XCOM is not for the faint hearted. Missed that 95% chance shot with your sniper, and getting your men killed the next turn? That's XCOM BABY! Have fun Commander!","November 30, 2013","true","27.9"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Graphical glitches do remain from Enemy Unknown and happen from time to time, EXALT is really not scary at all after the initial reveal, there aren’t a whole lot of extra maps for regular missions and although the new alien enemies are nice they don’t offer a whole lot extra and seeing even more types would then have been great.\n\nOn the other hand, the simple addition of EXALT does nicely shake up the game and the extra council missions are incredibly fun to do. The MEC class is a fantastic addition that is definitely satisfying to use and offers new strategic options, the Meld resource is a good extra goal to chase after, and the numerous extra research, foundry and of course gene mods are certainly a welcome addition that only serve to make this already highly enjoyable game that much better.\n\nFull review: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YJgWBj6JC0","November 27, 2013","true","50.9"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

THIS GAME IS BRILLIANT!! Totally innovative take on turn based strategy. With smooth swat style movement of your team across the field of battle, you really feel the impact of getting a kill when you need to and the pain of sacrificing someone when the mission comes first. Amazing gameplay mechanics for the strategy aspect and a great base building/management system for leveling up. You really feel the global urgency in the whole story flow, and the soldier customization allows you to start thinking about backstories for them. I almost cried when the Li-Lee brothers Bruce and Jet sacrificed themselves to save a fleeing V.I.P being escorted by Sarah Conner and Snake-eyes.

The variation between base management and combat creates a perfect pace, with two distinct well developed mechanics. The plot is very basic, the presentation is great, but the star goes to atmosphere it creates: it's tense, builds up very well and adds suspense throughout the entirety of the game: you really care about the soldiers you train and the misson they are undertaking, while you're always curious to learn about the aliens you are facing.

However, even if tactical parts are stripped down to a certain extent, this remake isn't anymore a simple remake. It's a remaster or a reboot; it has a rather good story line, it adds tons of gameplay features to consider being really good design choices, it got rid of bothering features like the air combat system (which had an awesome music track in the original nonetheless) and of course it has considerable visual/audio overhauls. This game stays true to its root(s) in a degree that it indeed is comparable to the original game (which is a really rare achievement for reboots) but, in my opinion, blows it away with so many additions that it beats the classic masterpiece. This game sets a new standard for this genre.\n\nVeterans, if you think it's too easy for you and I'd see where you'd be coming from; it offers many options to increase it's difficulty. If it's just to set the difficulty higher as a whole or to enable the Iron Man mode, where you play it a lot more like a rogue-lite (permadeath, auto-saving-only) or maybe enabling more randomness. You pay a bit freedom in this game (freedom of base locations i.e.), but you get so much more.\n\nI highly recommend this game to anyone slightly interested in TB-Combat.","December 13, 2013","true","446.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Armour upgrades can all be specialised to the units (e.g. use armour 1 for the sniper, 2 for heavy, etc.) without much thought, but still with a lot of precision.\n\nI can't actually think of very many downsides. Everything is really good.\n\nThe ending however; (Spoilers below. Mouse over for words, skip to ignore)\nDouble-tap the end boss in the head with an elite sniper and the boss dies. Although there are all these aliens around the main device, you can just ignore them, kill the end boss guy, and win the game. That was kind of disapointing.

That is the motto you live by in this awesome reboot of the long ignored but never faded title. After your first fight you get to head back to base and begin customizing soldiers the way you want, even so they are named after and resemble your friends and family, giving you just that much more investment in their continued survival. But soon the fights become more intense with choosing between moving your characters to better positions or taking the risk to stand your ground and fight. The enemies you face get progressively harder as you advance through the story (unless you're on a harder difficulty then then they get harder no matter how much you've progressed) and all of them have different ways of fighting you off. The tension is always up to 10 and goes to 11 on those times where you're outnumbered, outgunned and running low on medikits. Even if you make it back to base the tension does not let up. Different countries start to panic and threaten to leave the council that fund your operations. You live or die on the choices you make on a shoe-string budget. You even begin to sell off important assets just to make it a few more days.

The dreaded school-grade system.\n\nBefore plastering the grade all over your faces, i might as well recap some of the main problems in this game.\n\n\nOn the GAMEPLAY side, it is simplified greatly. Mostly for the console ports, this means little-to-no modification of squads inventory. Unless you count changing the off-hand items and body-armour, which i dont mind you..\n\nMovement and actions, are done by spending two (2) Action-Points. Now this sounded questionable to me the first time i played the game, but afterwards i came to the conclusion, that it is actually a good decision. It makes combat and strategic planning more questinable, knowing whether moving a soldier in that certain piece of cover (Il get to that point later), Protects him from any enemies that might appear behind the corner. And some of mote frantic combat bits are also made more tense with the finite number of actions you can do. Although, the game has a terrible tendency to CHEAT. Yes the AI cheats like a Free-to-player on mobile devices who got his hands on his moms credit-card.\n\nMultiple times, the AI takes an impossibly accurate shot. Through several walls and straight into the face of soldier who was in heavy cover and while in the tactical screen before going to combat, the AI decides to introduce three squads of baddies out of the blue, after you move one soldier just 5 meters (or the blue movement-indicator). This caused me a great pain when i decided to do the obligatory Ironman run. My poor assault specialist moved to a piece of cover i thought was safe at the time and suddenly 3 squads of Mutons appeared and pretty much circled the poor fellow. And as they circled the guy, the Mutons kept looking at eachother as asking "Who brought the lube ?"\n\nAnd the vaguely-referencing to-intimacy situations didn't stop there, there were multiple other similiar happenings all the way throught. Argh.. i cannot talk about it, it gave me PTS.\n\n\nWhat else?... Graphics.\n\nGraphical quality is console-level. And by that i mean early Xbox360. Bland and boring, low-resolution and just overall... Meh.\n\nAnd while on the subject of graphics, i need to bring up the Unreal Engine. It does this game no favours. I'm trying to think game that came out at the same time as XCOM and used Unreal as its engine. But my brain draws blank. Unreal Engine has its quirks, and for some reason i always see glitches when playing XCOM, even today as i Rage-Quitted another Ironman session due to the AIs cheating ways.... The camera goes spaztic randomly, pointing in random directions getiing stuck in some places and generally being broken.\n\nAnd there is whole another bag of delightfull glitches always hiding somewhere. in case you didnt know im playing the base game, since Enemy Within cost a bit too much on release and when it actually was on sale i had no money. So im not entirely sure whether the bug-fixes were in the expansion, following the CapCom way of balancing with its fighting games, or do i just have an obsolete version or do i need to re-install the game again, for the umpthteenth time... Nope its up-to-date.\n\nOh and another minor nitpick. The randomly forgets its set Graphics options. Out of the blue, just like that. b*llocks to that.\n\nWriting this is making me angry, not because of the game per-se. (Kinda funny that last word, it means A*SE [*R] in Finnish)\nIm angry because the game is just.... Just.... ADEQUATE.\n\nAlright you simpletons, better explain it properly:\n\nThe game is a decent re-imagining of XCOM, but its buggy nature and other minor problems makes it lose its value as an XCOM game. The Original, which works just fine since it uses DosBox. Has more options and i just realised why i disliked this game, the forementioned lack of options on what to do and the finite resources thing.\n\nI cant go on about this, otherwise il be here the whole forthnight.. Suffice to say, XCOM lacks in all aspects that made the original good.\n\nBut as a game on its own, i can recommend it.\n\nBut, but, i would still ALSO recommed trying the original, i know its clunky as all hell and the AI blinsides your soldiers now and again, but after a while you learn how to deal with that and adapt accordingly. Something that the remake kinda lacks i might add.\n\nAlright, time for the obligatory grade thing.. lets see..\n\nSemi-solid remake, hell amount of bugs and glitches even after "Patching", AI cheats like a motherf*cker..\nGot it.\n\nC+\n\nWhen you think about it, you know why i gave it that grade.","April 3, 2014","true","185.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

That is the motto you live by in this awesome reboot of the long ignored but never faded title. After your first fight you get to head back to base and begin customizing soldiers the way you want, even so they are named after and resemble your friends and family, giving you just that much more investment in their continued survival. But soon the fights become more intense with choosing between moving your characters to better positions or taking the risk to stand your ground and fight. The enemies you face get progressively harder as you advance through the story (unless you're on a harder difficulty then then they get harder no matter how much you've progressed) and all of them have different ways of fighting you off. The tension is always up to 10 and goes to 11 on those times where you're outnumbered, outgunned and running low on medikits. Even if you make it back to base the tension does not let up. Different countries start to panic and threaten to leave the council that fund your operations. You live or die on the choices you make on a shoe-string budget. You even begin to sell off important assets just to make it a few more days.

It is incrediably addictive, and has many great elements. For one the perma-death system is great. It is something that gives you the sence of nervousness as one of your best soliders is put into the frey of battle. The thought that you could lose him/her at any minute puts you one edge in evey battle. The base building system is extremely addictive as well, because chosing between the right research options could be life or death for your soliders and xcom its-self. Enemy variety is wonderful, few games are able to do what this one can each enemy acts/ behavies differently and the huge extent makes knowing your a top priority and giving veterins of the game a advantage.\n\nneg:\nThere are some graphical glithes, and the enemy can sometimes not make a desions, and require a restart, BUT most of it has been fixed and is something that can be looked past.\n\nConclusion:\nThis game is incrediably acchomplished in all feilds from enemy variety to gameplay.

For me, the biggest problem with the game is the slow pace of the combat scenes. Even if you turn off the cinematics during the combat, it still feels kinda slow, and will eventually start to feel boring and repetitive.\nAnother thing that makes the game even more repetetive is the lack in variety. The amount of different maps is very limited, and most of the maps always use the same objective of "kill all the enemies". A few maps do use other objectives like escourting and bomb defusal, but I think those occur too seldomly to bring any real variety to the actual "main game".\nI still recommend it though, it is a fun game.

As good as games like Total War and StarCraft are, turn-based strategy with a small squad was always my preference, because what actions you take feel like personal choices, making every single decision you make on and off the battlefield a tough one. And BOY, do they get tough. If you have paitence to loose time and time again, then an experience on the rewarding levels of Dark Souls awaits you. XCOM reminds me a lot of games like Fire Emblem, Advance Wars, or Tactics Orge, but it sprinkles some western elements into it as well as some sci-fi giving it a unique identity of its own. Overall, this game ends up culminating into a big pile of difficult, stratigec, rewarding fun. And honestly?

You will feel tension with the different member countries of the council due to the politics it entails as they ask for assistance with these invasions. You will feel stressed out on which upgrades you need to do first, but you will also feel satisfaction whenever you upgraded something and is extremely useful for your next missions.and lastly, you will feel a bond and attachment to your squad members which will be with you through thick and thin, from being a novice up to the time they really pack a punch.

I never once felt like the AI was intelligently maneuvering their troops to advantegous positions, 9 times out of 10 just relying on the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t of having arbritarily more stats on harder difficulties to outshoot you. The only real explanation for this is "That's XCOM, baby!" This game is beyond frustrating.\n\nHowever, it's a solid title through that. You can sink quite a few hours in this game, and even though you'll often scream and pull your hair out, you always come back for more. It's very fun and satisfying pulling off some awesome tactical moves like suppressing a unit then flushing him out of cover with a shotgun. Very cool.\n\nTry it. Seriously.

You are in command of XCOM, an organization devoted to fighting off the threat of alien invaders. Your mission is to protect the Earth from this invasion, stopping alien abductions, terror attacks on population centers, and otherwise keeping everyone from panicking and defunding your project, gradually accumulating superior weapons and technology from the aliens so that you have a fighting chance.\n\n\nOverall, the game is quite strong; the macro-level stuff is fairly addictive in its skinner-box techniques as there is always something new which is going to come just around the corner, and the combat-level stuff works well enough, though it is not perfect either. On the whole, it really makes you want to play through the whole game, though at the very end of the game it may end up feeling a bit strange; there comes a point at which you are really in control of the situation and the earlier desperation goes away, and about that same point the research starts really drying up, meaning that if you take too long to finish the game, it could potentially get a bit dry; the last couple missions before I beat the game were the weakest in the game simply because I had figured it out and there was little threat from the game at that point.\n\nStill, I played through and beat the game in three or four sittings, which is always a sign that a game has you hooked.\n","July 26, 2014","true","40.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

There's also an option that prevents you to save during missions which will make you think twice about what move you're going to make as every single mistake can change everything during a mission.\nThere's 5 classes (6 in enemy within) all with their own very important roles. Each time they level you get to choose a perk in their skill tree, normally each class has their set perks to choose from but there's an option that makes the perks random so you could end up with a soldier that has a perfect set of perks from different classes.\nXCOM also offers the ability to build up your own base, do research and create items and weapons and it's more or less up to you in what order you want to do things.\n\nThe Enemy Within expansion gives you a new class, a heavy cyborg/mech kind of class aswell as implants for regular soldiers that will boost them quite alot.\n\nThe missions in The Enemy Within are the same as in Enemy Unknown so if you think you'll only be playing the game once I would really recommend getting the expansion right away as it offers alot more options to your playthrough.\n\nEven if you're normally not a turn-based gamer I would recommend trying this game, you won't be disappointed.","December 23, 2013","true","61.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It's pretty much a tactical combat game, so that shouldn't be the case.\n- If you play with a decent tactical sense, you'll end winning "too soon".\n- Higher difficulty just gives you less "money", not smarter opponents (Again, it's supposed to be a tactical game, not grand strategy).\n\nIn the end, this is a very solid game, that will provide some great fun and even some good memories.\n\n","August 19, 2014","true","165.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

If turned based is your thing and you haven't played this, you are missing out.\n\nIt's got a story that keeps you interested and really wanting to push forward. In depth turn based combat that while on harder difficulties will completely change how you approach a fight. Unit, squad, and base advancement that will not only improve its capabilities to push your tech further, but your soldier as well.. physically, genetically, and mentally.\n\nThis "World Army" created by corporations, governments, and private investors has its own interesting aspects, especially in the grand scheme of the story. And by far my favorite part is turning on the languages for the different countries for your soldiers, makes the depth of it even better, though I do wish there were more languages.\n\nOn the downside, the AI can seemingly get some pretty insane RNG crits on your soldiers even on the easiest difficulties, and the end game is determined pretty heavily on how you play your hand early on. But this is also a good thing if you really like making that choice and sticking to it.\n\nAll in all, get it, you wont regret it unless you hate turned based strategy games. And for those who get it and beat it, try downloading and installing "The Long War" mod for the game, it will pretty much triple the amount of play time you get with the game and add a ton of fun new things to it.","May 9, 2015","true","178.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Most reboots/reimaginings/rediscoveries leave you with a bitter taste in your mouth.\n\nOk it's not funny. It's disappointing. And bitter.\n\nThe results of years of anticipation & longing, fear of letting down a frothing fanbase that crushes creativity & publishers rushing games out the door I suppose.\n\nBut anyways, that doesn't exist here. The bitter taste that is.\n\nThis reimagining seems to capture the spirit of whatever it is that made the original set of xcoms great whilst still dressing it in a way to appeal to the unwashed masses.\n\nThe low level tactical game which is I propose the meat of xcom is perhaps better than the originals. They've done away with a lot of the tedious micromanagement such as dragging ammo into or out of each of your soldiers. They've streamlined & simplified things & yet somehow still managed to retain enough so that it doesn't feel as if it's been dumbed down. You're left with nail biting decisions such as "should i rush forward to finish off this alien & risk exposing new aliens"? Or "should i take that 40% shot or cower in cover?".\n\nThe high level strategic game however leads a bit to be desired. There's only 1 base. & everything just feels a little bit boring once you've worked things out. I liked the way apocalypse headed with all the crazy levels of details in the city layer & this seems like a fair step backwards.\n\nAnywayz, i hereby award this 11 thumbs up.","November 12, 2015","true","406.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

Your squad is deep and varied, tech and research provides gear that changes up your options and approaches, and the presentation and story are done in a compelling and involving way; it's not hard for me to develop attachments to my individual soldiers, especially with campaign options that allow each to have a unique skill tree.\n\nAll of the things I like about this game are further enhanced by the Long War mod for it-- more equipment, more challenge, more character builds with more compelling and balanced options, and more varied technology to uncover.  If you're a fan of base building strategy and turn-based tactics, this one deserves a look-- buy it with Enemy Within, its fully featured expansion pack that greatly improves the campaign experience and lets you train psychic humans using alien tech, among other things.

He seems to be quite remarkable in the sense that he misses all his 40% - 90% shots and I can only assume that this is because he is a financially deprived alcoholic who left his kids to join XCOM and is too drunk to shoot. Although he makes incredible game changing 10%-20% chance to hit shots all the time. Needless to say, I warmed to him immediately and I literally think he has a hidden 'luck of the irish' perk or a four leaf clover stowed away somewhere.\n\nBryan Murphy is the only reason I am continuing to play my current playthrough and that is because of his rather magical ability to save soldiers he considers more important than him. However this is not the case. For this reason I am seriously considering spending vast amount of XCOM savings to put Bryan Murphy through officer's school. Hopefully this would boost his self esteem long enough for him to agree to a rehab program I have set up in base to help recovering substance abusers better themselves.  As a commander I am seriously concerned for his well being.\n\nCome christmas time, I always give my soldiers a christmas bonus to raise their morale. I even take days off when the alien threat is minimal to go out and help my troops buy quality presents at excellent prices. Due to Bryan Murphy's drinking habits I personally took the liberty of visiting his loved ones and shopping on Bryan's behalf incase he was too intoxicated to remember to do so himself.\n\nDespite a shady origin and troubled personal life, Bryan is a hardworking member of XCOM and is always ready to take on new challenges on the battlefield. He has distinguished himself amoung his peers as a good guy to watch your back. Whenever I want to test experimental weapons, armour or genetic alterations, Bryan is first in line to get to grips with the new equipment. Should the day come where Bryan wishes to leave the military and seek purpose elsewhere I give my absolute recommendation and can asure potential employers that he will receive flawless references from the XCOM project.\n\nTL;DR XCOM: Enemy Unknown makes you care for your soldiers\n\n10/10","December 9, 2015","true","76.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

I fully approve of this makeover, it's in many ways streamlined in a good way. Kind of what Mass Effect (2) did. You can even play comfortably with a controller except that the game can be still as brutal and gripping as the ´94 one, especially in Ironman mode. Turn-based tactics that don't feel like micromanaging a sidejob, while the situations and tension can still make you crap bricks. Permanent death for your favorite soldier still hurts. The expansion Enemy Within has an excellent pile of extra choices and content on top, but I'd recommend getting that only for later playthroughs, the game's beginning is hassle enough in vanilla already if you're playing first time. If you want to obsessively control every single bullet that goes in every marine's clip, there's always the original or Xenonauts for you.

There's also an option that prevents you to save during missions which will make you think twice about what move you're going to make as every single mistake can change everything during a mission.\nThere's 5 classes (6 in enemy within) all with their own very important roles. Each time they level you get to choose a perk in their skill tree, normally each class has their set perks to choose from but there's an option that makes the perks random so you could end up with a soldier that has a perfect set of perks from different classes.\nXCOM also offers the ability to build up your own base, do research and create items and weapons and it's more or less up to you in what order you want to do things.\n\nThe Enemy Within expansion gives you a new class, a heavy cyborg/mech kind of class aswell as implants for regular soldiers that will boost them quite alot.\n\nThe missions in The Enemy Within are the same as in Enemy Unknown so if you think you'll only be playing the game once I would really recommend getting the expansion right away as it offers alot more options to your playthrough.\n\nEven if you're normally not a turn-based gamer I would recommend trying this game, you won't be disappointed.","December 23, 2013","true","61.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I'm confident that it's currently impossible to do, therefore most of the time you have to send an overall solid team on each mission, instead of adjusting it according to the battlefield.\n2) Making the base development at least feel faster. It's terribly slow to do, although you're supposed to be the top organization on Earth fighting against the biggest threat in human history. It's just a game, but cmon, the support you're getting from other countries is pitiful.\n3) Random damage spread is very unforgiving. It forces you to rely more on gadgets and abilities, which is good, but especially Overwatching is often worthless due to the pure hit chance. I'd prefer if it affected the amount of dealt damage rather than only deciding between hit and miss. So if the hit chance was 60% for 10 damage, it would still most likely do that 8-10 damage, a worse dice roll would result somehing between 0-4, but not always only 0.\n\nIf these points were fixed, it would be a nearly perfect game. Now it's occasionally quite frustrating, most of the time very nice and enjoyable, but just sometimes frustrating.","December 27, 2015","true","16.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

A grid is a two dimensional field in which everything is partitioned off into tiles which all take up the exact same amount of space and have the same shape.  Each tile is arranged on the grid such that it's position in relation to all other tiles is exactly the same as any other tile's position in relation to the tiles that surround it.  Grids can continue on in any direction for as long as they need to.  You can think of grids as a sort of pattern that can be extended or cut short (made shorter or longer), but the pattern will stay the same.  Grids do not need to have a consistent shape, but the patterning of the tiles does need to remain consistent.  If you are still having trouble grasping the idea of grid I can suggest some additional reading:\n\nMetric Spaces by Thomas Wieting (2013) [people.reed.edu/~wieting/essays/MetricSpaces.pdf]\nThe Amazing World of Grids by Harold Svenberg (1957)\nGrids and Lowest Level Computational Methods by Paul Moore (1989)\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Grid\nhttp://etc.usf.edu/clipart/42600/42677/grid_42677_lg.gif\n\nIf you are still having trouble grasping the concept of grids I suggest you go back and re-read my introductory paragraph with the knowledge that you now have from your additional readings.  Yeah, I realize that that's a bit of a cop-out but I'm kind of at a loss for how to explain this any more clearly to you.  I really thing that you must be overthinking this, a grid is not something that you normally have to explain to people at all.  Even with children who do not know what a grid is you can show them some examples and they'll get the basic idea.  I mean you certainly don't need to be some sort of grid guru just to understand what I'm going to be saying in this review.  You really just need a basic understanding and some common knowledge.\n\nSorry, I think I came off a bit condescending there.  Let's try this again.  I know you can get this if you just take it slow and try to think critically.  Grids are made up of tiles, tiles are arranged inside of the grid in a constant pattern.  Really the tiles are just subdivisions of the area that the grid covers, a way of splitting up the space into many different parts that all have the same size and shape.\n\nNow come on, don't be so hard on yourself, I KNOW you can do this!  You've come this far and I can't let you give up.  I want you to think about grids for an hour each day until you finally have a firm grasp on the matter.  All I ask is one hour.  Return once you've completed that for me, and good luck!\n\nWell congratulations, you did it!  I know this road must have been long and hard for you but I think that you've achieved something truly remarkable.  I'm proud of you and I encourage you to be proud of yourself.  You've worked hard enough, go ahead and take the rest of the day off, as a present to yourself.  You've earned it!  Then once you've rested up get out there and seize the day with your newfound familiarity with grids!","May 28, 2015","true","50.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","2","2","2","0"

You are in command of XCOM, an organization devoted to fighting off the threat of alien invaders. Your mission is to protect the Earth from this invasion, stopping alien abductions, terror attacks on population centers, and otherwise keeping everyone from panicking and defunding your project, gradually accumulating superior weapons and technology from the aliens so that you have a fighting chance.\n\n\nOverall, the game is quite strong; the macro-level stuff is fairly addictive in its skinner-box techniques as there is always something new which is going to come just around the corner, and the combat-level stuff works well enough, though it is not perfect either. On the whole, it really makes you want to play through the whole game, though at the very end of the game it may end up feeling a bit strange; there comes a point at which you are really in control of the situation and the earlier desperation goes away, and about that same point the research starts really drying up, meaning that if you take too long to finish the game, it could potentially get a bit dry; the last couple missions before I beat the game were the weakest in the game simply because I had figured it out and there was little threat from the game at that point.\n\nStill, I played through and beat the game in three or four sittings, which is always a sign that a game has you hooked.\n","July 26, 2014","true","40.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

So it's fairly easy to recommend- if you liked the first X-com, or liked its crushingly unfair difficulty, you'll enjoy this new game. You get a nice graphical facelift for your troubles, and a little mixup of the types of aliens; Snakemen have changed? evolved? into Thin-Men, for example. The game is streamlined a lot and much of the stats and things are hidden away to perhaps draw in a more casual gamer, though the "classic" difficulty is there to satisfy veterans with plenty of dead rookies. My few complaints usually hung on the UI. It's poor, and especially during missions the game would frequently ignore clicks, or have a lot of trouble with multi-story missions. If you're an X-com fan you've probably already played it, but for the uninitiated I would suggest it too, for you've probably never picked up a turn based squad game before, and they're quite fun.","January 12, 2013","true","21.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

There's also an option that prevents you to save during missions which will make you think twice about what move you're going to make as every single mistake can change everything during a mission.\nThere's 5 classes (6 in enemy within) all with their own very important roles. Each time they level you get to choose a perk in their skill tree, normally each class has their set perks to choose from but there's an option that makes the perks random so you could end up with a soldier that has a perfect set of perks from different classes.\nXCOM also offers the ability to build up your own base, do research and create items and weapons and it's more or less up to you in what order you want to do things.\n\nThe Enemy Within expansion gives you a new class, a heavy cyborg/mech kind of class aswell as implants for regular soldiers that will boost them quite alot.\n\nThe missions in The Enemy Within are the same as in Enemy Unknown so if you think you'll only be playing the game once I would really recommend getting the expansion right away as it offers alot more options to your playthrough.\n\nEven if you're normally not a turn-based gamer I would recommend trying this game, you won't be disappointed.","December 23, 2013","true","61.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Yes, you will say "just one more turn/battle/other increment of play" until you realize you've been playing longer than you meant to. But that's a good thing.\n\nXCOM is divided into two sorts of games. There's the management portion, where you manage your XCOM base, research new technologies, launch satelites, destroy UFOs, manage you (initially very small) budget and try not to let the worldwide panic go up too high. This portion of the game starts out fairly challenging, with multiple countries in states of panic depening on your choices and a limited budget that you must decide what to do with. However, this challenge soon becomes non-existent. Late in the game you end up no longer facing the choice of which of two countries to help, and panic seldom goes over a single bar. Though to be fair, this really only happens when you're completing all of your missions without fail.\n\nThe other portion of the game is the tactical combat portion. In this part you send your squad of up to 6 soldiers into specific missions. This part remains engaging throughout. It plays like a turn-based, cover-based shooter. Which is an interesting mix. Later in the game you get more abilities for your soldiers, which creates some interesting choices. Facing a new type of enemy can be interesting as you don't know what kinds of things they are capable of (will they do heavy damage? Mind control your soldiers? Do damage to you if they die near you?) though that effect wears off when you've seen all there is to offer. Death for your soldiers is permanant, but in some cases you can save them by getting them a medikit when they fall.\n\nThe two portions of the game are engaging on their own, and feed into one another nicely.\n\nI do have a few gripes with the game though. I wish when soldiers went down they would ALWAYS be able to be revived with a medikit, as it seems to be based on chance now, and can be frustrating. Late game can be a bit unchallenging as well, but that's really only an issue if you're just grinding to max out your levels before the final battle. (Which is easier than I thought it would be, so grinding isn't recommended anyway.) Even when doing that though, a wrong move can still mean death for your soldiers. The ending is also kind of... meh. Lots of questions left, few answers. It does leave things open for a sequel though.\n\nI highly recommend this game if you're into thinking-type games. If you're looking for another mindless shooter where you blow up aliens... look elsewhere. Great replay value as well, with multiple difficulty settings.","March 7, 2015","true","51.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","2","2","2","0"

The mix of tactics and strategy, the ability to scare the daylights out of you, with tough missions and excellent rewards meant it still has a place on my hard drive ven today.\n\nSo when they decided to change up the formula for the new XCOM, I was apprehensive. When I first played it, I thought it was good but not great. It just felt like it was missing too many tactical options. So while the game was certainly well done and a fresh new take on the series - while still remaining true to the turn based roots and source material - I felt it was missing something. I simply felt constrained by the tactical combat options. But it still is a solid game on its own. Just not a great one.\n\nBut with the expansion, this game feels complete. It's still not as good as the original, but it stands on its own two feet and is a great gaming experience. The combat is the central part of the game and it's generally well done. There are irritants of course, but it's good - and once you get deeper into the game with the meld options it becomes fantastic. You can build your squad of soldiers and really shape your approach to combat.\n\nPlus, the production values in research, manufacturing and the overall story are pretty darn good too. These "add on" components aren't very deep, but you are forced to make difficult choices. Do you use that meld to boost your sniper or create a walking tank? Which nation do you sacrifice and who gets coverage from the alien invasion? Which mission do you go on? Do you try to save that soldier in a bad position or do you let him die? Meaningful choices are in every part of the game.\n\nNow you might ask what's the expansion versus the base game and why did it make it so much better? I'll leave it to you to get the feature list from the store page. But in my opinion it wasn't so much the quantity of what they added but what was added gives players enough options to really approach the tactical battles the way they'd like. Do you want super-soldiers? Or do you prefer tough guys enhanced by Aliens-style exoskelletons that can punch an alien through a wall?\n\nThere are two big flaws in this game to me:\n\n1. The missions aren't always interesting enough. There's an early one involving a ship (that floats, not flies) that's incredibly well done. It's tight, tough and gripping. But that's the only real memorable mission in the game which is too bad. They could have done so much more with crafting some more interesting missions.\n\n2. I hate that when you find a group of enemies they call get to run for cover before the fighting starts. It's a "gamey" decision that detracts from proper planning by the player.\n\nStill, these are fairly minor warts given the fun I had with it. In my book the base game is solid and good. The expansion takes it to another level. It's still not as good as the original, but it's worthy of the name of the title and the best game of this style since the original.  This title - with the expansion - belongs in any gamer's library. Highly recommened.","March 24, 2015","true","117.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/heath_jeffrey/recommended/200510/","heath_jeffrey","Beyond Malachi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/heath_jeffrey/","23 products in account","Cons:\n- Some 'random number generator' frustrations because of the way 'chance to hit' plays a big role in the game.  At 75% chance to hit, you can count on missing multiple times every couple of battles, which usually results in a teammate dying.  (And even though the game is kind of designed to let characters die now and again, it's actually such a big penalty that you do NOT want it to happen).  Even at max, 95% chance to hit, you'll get the occasional 2 or 3 in-a-row miss that drives you crazy.  Save often so you can quit and reload when someone dies.\n- It's possible to ruin the game for yourself early on through the base management (the Sim City-ish bit).  I can't remember what it was, exactly, but one thing you can invest in results in the aliens levelling up.  Invest too much too early, and you'll be facing deadly aliens while you're still at low levels with no cash.  At that point it is literally impossible to win.  Definitely look up a couple of FAQs before you start, so you can avoid this.\n\nPros:\n- Absolutely, utterly, everything else.\n- The storyline is brilliant.  Intrigue, conspiracy, side-stories that tie in well with the main story, and gameplay and character and facility development that is heavily tied into the storyline.\n- I was really surprised that the sci-fi alien attack setting was really well done.  Enough human development and intrigue focus that it didn't feel overly 'Star Trek-ky' or anything.\n- Base and facility development isn't my kind of thing, but it was actually quite enjoyable in this case - more about levelling up aspects of your team than really micro managing everything Sim City style.  There was one thing related to how you level things up to avoid (see above), but otherwise it seemed secondary to the actual missions and battles.\n- A good amount of variety amongst the types of soldiers you can get, with such different abilities that you really utilise them in different ways.  This really plays up the strategy aspect, as you decide which combinations of soldier types to use each battle.\n- Having soldiers get injured, so they can't join missions for a while, is a great idea.  It forces you to play with combinations you might avoid otherwise, which adds extra variety and depth to the game.\n- The abilities... and then the super duper awesome abilities that you won't believe you get later!  (Hint: If you read any FAQs, don't trust them when they say you need to focus on one set of the two super sets of options that come available.  You can afford to invest in both, and it's MUCH more fun to have both).\n- Quite a good range of mission types and alien types keep the variety going.\n- Other stuff that I can't remember or can't tell you for spoiler reasons.\n\nThe cons are pretty big, but you can avoid one if you read up on it a little and reduce the other by getting into regular saving habits.  I did both, and I honestly think XCOM is the best game I've played in years and years.  There are some other great games (like Divinity: Original Sin) that come close, but this edged them out because... it is simply THAT cool.","June 1","true","10.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The countries that fund Xcom each desire you’re services and as they get attacked it falls on you to resolve whatever situations arise. The aliens will attack three countries simultaneously and since you only own one transport ship (no matter what) you may only respond to one in every three attacks. When this occurs you will weigh the rewards and aid the wealthiest or most convenient country… the other two countries will “panic” and if neglected for long enough they will quit Xcom and withdraw a portion of your monthly funding… Heres the kicker… every time a country is left unaddressed in a crisis their panic level will rise by 2…. However every other country on the same continent will rise by one!  There are a few game mechanics that allow you to delay you’re inevitable defeat but nothing to out rightly stop it. You must beat the game before you lose eight nations.\n\nSo to recap\n1. You will buy aircraft in sets of four at a time and you can have a hundred soldiers on standby but you can only own one transport ship and therefore can only respond to one third of all alien related crisis… Also the transport ship only seats six at a time… when upgraded….\n2. Countries will inevitably quit, when they quit you cannot provide any incentive to bring them back into the fold. You will lose when eight countries quit because no paramilitary group can perform efficiently without the support of Argintina, Nigeria, Cairo, South Africa, Brazil and three other second world (I’m feeling generous) nations.\n\nThat’s the premise. What about the game play?\n\nWhen the aliens “attack” a city you usually get there after they have inflicted the maximum amount of damage they can given the ordinance at their disposal. You’ll walk through urban areas and note that despite a few corpses they are completely depopulated. The only sounds emanating from the city are non specific alien growling, I found it strongly nostalgic and reminiscent of Doom. Now the kicker is that the aliens aren’t engaged in any particular activity when you discover them, in fact they don’t actually exist on the level at all until a member of your squad reaches a predetermined point. Once you step on the games invisible red wire poof! a plethora of alien life appears. They promptly interrupt you’re turn and fan out and occupy the best defensive or offensive positions. Since the game is ostensibly a strategy game you will scramble for better cover or attempt to flank them… only to get counter flanked by a second or even third group of spawning aliens.\n\nHere’s the fun part. The aliens cover more ground then you, they have more support skills and offensive abilities then you, they have significantly better aim then you, Before long they get guys that are tougher than yours. They even “wallhack” and will target members of your squad that they haven’t rightfully seen. The first rule of Xcom is that the aliens outnumber you… on earth.\n\nThe core gameplay of any turn based squad strategy game is ultimately going to be about cover and how well cover is integrated into the actual game play. Well heres the word. Most enemies are able to traverse great distances on ground. Some of them also have abilities that directly negate or ignore cover. “Thin men” can spit venom over obstacles to hit soldiers they haven’t seen. Floaters can fly off the map and reappear at its opposite end ext. In this game cover is over rated. You’re guys are going to be shot through walls, cars and hills. In turn You’re guys… earth’s last hope and the super elite of every nations military will consistently miss shots on enemies  in plain sight on level terrain with no hint of obstacles or cover in the way.\n\nRecap\n1. You’re soldiers are all near sighted. They can see for maybe thirty yards on a clear day, not counting obstacles. This game mechanic is done to hide the fact that the aliens will spawn at designated locations just outside you’re field of vision.\n2. The Alien AI is rudimentary at best. They will occupy defensive features… If they spawn right next to them\n3.. The strategic nature of the game is purely aesthetic. If you attempt to fan out and flank them you will only spawn more aliens and get caught in a cross fire.\n\nIn conclusion. Turn based strategy games are a niche genre and companies that cater to a niche get catered to by the niche. There is no logical need for improvement and their first priority is rightfully to keep their fans happy. An outsider will play this game and realize very quickly that while they thought they were taking home a strategy game they were actually getting a glorified version of Russian roulette, a random number generator. While it has great aesthetic value, strong writing and passable voice acting it brings very little to the table that wasn’t present in the 90s and relies very heavily on mechanics that have been defunct since the days of John Romero… There are a number of mods that seek to improve Xcom and fix many of the aforementioned quirks but it’ll be many years before I give Xcom a third chance. Until then if I get a strong urge to play a turn based strategy game I’ll return to 1997’s Final Fantasy Tactics which still stands at the top of the genre.\n\nPS: *SPOILERS* The enemy is the aliens.","June 13, 2014","false","20.4"," 55 of 106 people (52%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","52","55","106","2","0"

Between trying to manage a base and trying to win battles out on the field of combat, the entire experience comes together beautifully. Its not the type of game I can play day, as its actually quite stressing at times, yet its the game I find myself picking up again and again. Its challenging, bordering on needlessly brutal, but its the type of game that inspires you to get better and play on harder difficulties in order to overcome even worse odds.\n\nIf you find yourself wishing that strategy games were less about who could click the fastest and spam the hardest, and offered a more tactical, thoughtful approach, then this is the type of game for you. They don't make too many like this anymore, and I wish they did.\n\nI am impatiently waiting for news of a second full game in this reboot series.

Reviews, the zeitgeist, friends and relatives. XCOM is good they told me. I was disinterested. I was wrong.\n\nA tactical tour-de-force not without its limitations and frustrations, and lacking in real artistic punch, XCOM is well worth a purchase.\n\nYou're handed command of a force tasked with stopping the alien invasion of earth. You have an underground base, which is essentially your menu screen giving you access to your soldiers and the customisation options available (both practical, such as gear they take into battle, and superficial options such as name or appearance can be altered here) and you choose your research projects, buy gear and generally make the big decisions about how you want to save the world.\nOnce you launch a mission, various different types of which exist, you're given an isometric viewpoint and turn based control of your squad and told to, in most cases eliminate all trace of the alien menace.\nYou will carefully position your squad in cover, your sniper on overwatch, your assault on the frontlines, edging your way through the fog of war until aliens are spotted and it will be going well. You'll remove the first batch and feel smug, clear the map, return to base and congratulate yourself on a job well done. You conduct missions in each of the 18 countries signed up to the XCOM project, and keep the panic from spreading with your successes.\nSoon however when the stronger, move maneuverable, harder to kill aliens show up in missions and start ruining your plans by spitting poisonous clouds just where you wanted to be, or flanking your oh so carefully positioned sniper who has been with you since Mission #1 and sending her to her perma-death covered on plasma burns, you will be livid that you've been out gunned and out thought. After liming through the mission your battered squad return to base where your decision to build a research lab instead of a workshop isn't looking so great, Germany is on the verge of leaving the alliance and taking funding with them, because you chose to respond to a threat in Japan last mission as the reward was more use to you at the time, but the earth needs saving, and with a little luck you still think you can manage it.

With all the classes and equipment, multiple levelling up paths, and particularly the Enemy Within content (genetic modification and cyborgs - hells yes!), you always feel like you are getting more powerful - and the enemies difficulty scales up with you!\n\nMy only complaint for Xcom original harcores is that the line of site and mind control mechanics are a bit rough around the edges (if you try to storm entrenched aliens from above, you're going to have a bad time!).\n\nAnd one final thought - even though I am a PC-first gamer - you have to play this one with a controller. UI is so much slicker and more precise (especially when moving in tactical battles) - and you have to try zooming in on your base and see your soldiers hanging out and training - never even figured out how to do it with keyboard and mouse!\n\nBoth main game and Enemy Within are must buys for any strategy gamer!","March 22, 2014","true","97.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

In this part turn-based startegy part base management game, you protect Earth from an invading alien force. Sound familiar? Just another alien game? Rest assured, this game is much more than it appears to be, and is a rare treat for tose looking for a game that pushes you cognitive abilities.\n\nI have never felt my brain go into strategic-overdrive as it did when I played this game. Fair-warning, this game does NOT hold your hand, and to avoid losing (that's right, you can LOSE a 20 hour game) you'll have to be both quick-witted and an effective  base manager. Only those who conduct the proper research, manage resources and money efficiently, smartly equip their soldiers, and maintain their relationships with the countries in the XCOM council will succeed in their turn-based skirmishes, where players control up to six marines to eliminate the alien threat.\n\nThe duality of this game is one of its strengths, as the ground battles and the base management go hand-in-hand. Didn't invest in the titan armor research? Well I guess your soldiers are going to perish an unnatural death down on the ground. Failed to protect a member of the council on an important mission? Well I guess Nigeria is pulling out of the XCOM project and thus cutting its funding.\n\nSpeaking of failure, that is also another one of the game's strengths, and something you'll be deeply terrified of. You can name and customize your soldiers, and eventually you become attached to them (think pokemon), arming your favorite guy to the teeth and giving him a badass nickname. And these soldiers will go through Hell, facing a mulitude of different alien classes, each with completely distinct looks and effective strategies to use againts. However, your precious characters can die permenantly in these missions if you don't do everything with clockwork effiency. That same urgency extends to the diplomatic side of the game. If you screw up to many times, enough nations will leave the council and you LOSE. This sort of challenge is rare in modern games and is a welcome revival.\n\nAll in all, if you're looking for a exhilerating game that engages your brain, tis one's for you.","February 12, 2014","true","36.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CIarkness/recommended/200510/","CIarkness","CIarkness","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CIarkness/","132 products in account","This is a review for the XCOM along with all the dlc's, so that means XCOM: Enemy Within.\n\nSo far, this game is fantastic, very unique gameplay compare to basic turn based strategy games. Variety of options included for those who wants a challenge or simply prefer the game easier. This game does have a multiplayer as well, but I have not yet tested that out, the singleplayer however, is simply amazing.\n\nThe game involves you controlling a squad of members, taking cover and strategic positions on the battlefield while attempting to make tactical decisions focusing on objective as well as keeping your squad alive. There are several classes as well, base classes are Assault, Support, Heavy, and Sniper. You can genetically modify those classes or even machin-nize your soldiers to make them exceed farther. As game progresses, the game also requires you to research and construct facilities in order to advance in both tech and more of overall diplomatic control. One of the game's biggest element are countries under the council, as aliens attack, you would be force to make decisions that pro's one of the countries but con's the other countries, ultimately influencing the panic level. When a panic level hits 5 bars, a country would likely to leave the XCOM project, making it so they no longer can fund you. When a certain number of countries leave XCOM, the game is over.\n\nGraphic: 8/10\nExplanation: The performance is very well done, and I do enjoy the action-figure type of graphic, the FPS caps at 62 for smooth, that isn't a problem for me. However, I believe there's space for graphic improvement, overall a 8 which is pretty godo.\n\nPlot: 7/10\nExplanation: The game does have pretty good plot overall, however, XCOM in my opinion is one of those games where you play for the gameplay and the research, spending time trying to find out why aliens are attacking. So plot is less reliant when it comes to overall feel.\n\nGameplay: 10/10\nExplanation: The gameplay is absolutely amazing, first of all it's pretty unique compare to modern day's games, it combines RTS aspects with turn based TRPG. Really polished, always neat stuff to look forward to, and overall if you enjoy strategy games, I would say you would like this as well. The sci-fi theme is a plus for me.\n\nReplayability: 8/10\nExplanation: This is more sort of my current feel with the game, with Second Wave (Additional Game Options) I would certainly not mind replaying a game maybe twice for a different route and a different result, as for others I can certainly see less replay value for them. I would not rely however, on multiplayer for replayability over singleplayer.\n\nOverall: 9/10\nConclusion: Great game, if you are considering or wondering rather or not to get this game, don't think about it, add it to your cart right now. I got it during the steam sale from around $25 along with all the dlc's, which was a steal, at full price it is very well worth every penny. One thing I would say is, don't get too attach to your squad, they will most likely die hehe.","January 4, 2014","true","47.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The aliens may be the same, and in fact I'd say they did a good job of updating all the aliens to be something new and unique, but this has almost none of the traditional x-com charm and difficulty. Everything is based on a very simple cover system... either you're in cover, or you're not. You don't shoot in the direction of enemies, like you do in the original games, but rather you shoot at a single enemy, and either you hit, or you miss. If you miss, you might get lucky and blow up their cover.\n\nThe game operates on a mob group system. Aliens are in groups, and if they spot you, they get a cinematic in which they run in to cover. This means that if a group of aliens has not seen you this turn, they will not shoot you during their turn, so the threat is minimal. Even at the start of the game, you're fielding a squad of 4 guys vs. many aliens. Later on you go up to a whopping 6, making the aliens feel very weak... how are we even losing this war?\n\nAll that said, if you take away the xcom, the game is a functional TBT. It's fairly decent, and can be quite enjoyable. If you're looking for x-com, skip it and go buy xenonauts, or go help out with any of the open source fan projects out there.\n\nSadly, the game is also riddled with bugs. Sometimes you will be unable to shoot an enemy, even though they can shoot you. Sometimes your troops will end up walking somewhere they can't go, resulting in them being stuck for the mission if they can't fly. There's many others, especially in multiplayer, so only get it if you're interested in TBT. It's a good introduction of the genre to those who wouldn't normally play such.","November 28, 2013","true","213.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

You begin as a mostly weak military organization set to keep alien invasions at bay. As you complete missions and capture and examine aliens, you can research and acquire their technology to make yourself even more powerful. Begin with a group of rookies shooting with cheap assault rifles and end with a team of elite soldiers with plasma weaponry, advanced armor that lets you climb up walls, and psionic abilities to decimate alien opponents.\n\nInvestments and time management are a necessity in normal mode and absolutely critical in the game's famous "Classic" mode, which requires several difficult decisions and sacrifices to complete the game successfully. XCOM is a fun and challenging time on its own in this respect apart from the already excellent combat system.\n\nXCOM: Enemy Within is also a great "true" expansion to the game that adds lots of great weapons and story content. It's a hell of a lot more relevant than today's cheap DLC injections into every video game.\n\nTry Ironman Mode for an extra challenge. Every decision you make sticks to one auto save, so you can't reload if you make a mistake.","January 29, 2014","true","57.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

In short: it's a Sci-fi strategy game.\n\n-Detailed breakdown review-\nStory:  You're the worlds primary defense against Alien Invasion, you are the leader of the XCOM Project. Your job is simple: beat the aliens. But accomplishing that task isn't so simple, you need t keep the world nations calm, research technology, and then have your engineers create whatever the scientists have cooked up.\n\nGame Play: Game play is where this game really shines, the graphics are fun to see, it's easy to implement many unorthodox strategies, you get to customize your base, but the most important investment of your resources will be in weapons and armor.\n\nIt is very important to emphases the difficulty of this game; unless you happen to be some military genius or a natural at this game (either could be true, and you still need to save before and after each battle) you will need to save your progress and reload from that save state. On the easiest difficulty the aliens will have no problem blowing up the poor S.O.B. you left out of cover because you misclicked... Trust me, he/she will be dead or in uselessly low health.\n\nBy the end of this game I had recovered a terrible habit/condition... called "Save before you do anything". I developed this habit while playing Pokemon and Knights of the Old Republic. Upon playing this game I was saving before and after every battle.\n\nAchievements: There are the standard achievement type: Beat the game, beat the game on the hardest difficulty, do this unique thing while playing the game. There are also DLC achievements, so you will need to own the DLC if you want to get 100% completion.\n\nConclusion: All in all, I have really enjoyed this game, and will definitely be spending more time working on the harder difficulties. This game can easily be put in the top Tiers of Strategy games that were developed in 2010-2015.\n\nTo recap: Story - Interesting, not really the selling point, but doesn't take away from it. Gameplay, very good - much micromanaging. Achievements, 50-60% easily obtainable just from playing, the rest are rough or DLC.","March 7, 2015","true","33.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The long campaign is challenging enough on Normal, with a big leap in enemy threat and movement on Classic - both of which are enhanced immeasurably by Ironman mode, which removes the temptation to save-cheat. The last difficulty level, Impossible, rightly so, your soldiers will die, a lot! This game is a winner. So much craft has gone into its atmosphere, into small details that together add enormous depth and flavour to the world: the occasional conversations overheard while fiddling around in the base; the mission loading screen, which gives you a view of the troops inside the carrier, fidgeting and tapping their feet in transit; soldiers acquiring nicknames after a few missions; the memorial room for fallen warriors, with a cork board of photos on the wall, which records their names. Near the campaign's end, there's a direct tribute to the original game's designers, the Gollop brothers, accompanied by an achievement called 'On the Shoulders of Giants'. It's a beautiful touch, a nod from one development team to another across the generations. They have something in common now. In their own time and place, each made a fantastic game called XCOM.","March 10, 2015","true","180.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I was looking forward to playing it for its tactical turn-based combat system, but found myself having more fun with the base management, research and engineering system. However, it does not come without any faults, I encountered numerous bugs, ranging from the non-saving options menu (that I have to re-configure each time I play) to buggy in-game user interface.\n\nThe meat of the game, tactical turn-based combat, was an OK experience (Line of sight system isn't perfect, sometimes an alien is right in front of you and your soldier can't see them, I didn't enjoy the Overwatch mechanic, and randomly activating 3 alien camps with one movement is not fun). The best part of this game is the squad system, you get to customize and outfit all your soldiers;  there being different classes, abilities trees, weapons and equipment.\n\nSidenote: I do criticize Firaxis for releasing XCOM: Enemy Within as a standalone game on consoles, but on PC you have to buy the $32 base game XCOM: Enemy Unknown before you can play the $32 Enemy Within, which is just the same campaign as XCOM:EU with some extra missions and updates. I would recommend XCOM: EU, but buy Enemy Within only if you like the base game and if it goes on sale.","May 26, 2015","true","47.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","1"

It's unique, it's intuitive, it's absorbing and it's a hell of a lot of fun. The game is essentially a strategy RPG where you have to plan every move you make meticulously and with attention to military squad and cover tactics, but you have to manage the back end as well. Engaging in a bit of building and management simulation akin to a 4x game to make sure that your troops are able to keep up with the enemy's technology levels. It's incredibly engaging to pull off a perfect mission, or have to make difficult decisions where one side of the game has to make sacrifices for the other. The game can be very unfair or even luck-based at times, but it's easy to get back into and it can make hopeless battles if not fun then still engaging and rewarding on a more personal level (in an emergent storytelling sort of way). Consider this one a strong general recommendation, walking a perfect line between accessibility and compexity.","February 16, 2014","true","83.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The strategic mode leaves you researching and contructing a bunch of toys to use and looking forward to the missions where you'll get new resources and things to research, and the tactical missions leave you with new enemy after new enemy and all sorts of items to bring back.  It evokes the feel of the original very well.  I'm not the biggest fan of the change to a much more colourful and Fisher-Price type look of the tech and in particular the weapons, which all look like childrens toys, but otherwise the visual look and feel is implemented very well and perhaps just as importantly consistently.  The game just gels very well together in terms of gameplay, visual design, and sound design.  The production values are high and so is the fun.  The only real thing I felt was a misstep other than some elements of the visual design is the difficulty.  While the original could be tortuous sometimes and some scaling back was probably neccesary in today's gaming market, the game is actually pretty easy on all but the highest difficulty, as long as you stick with troops with good stats and stay on top of research and production of new weapons.  One of the disappointing things for me in that regards was the chrysallids.  In the original they were Aliens-inspired creatures that would zombify your men or civillians, and when you killed the zombie a new chrysallid would emerge.  It made things very frantic when you saw one.  Comparatively, the new chrysallids look and feel very different.  While they do have an instant-kill melee attack (the originals actually didnt, except insofar as they hit like a brick s**thouse), the zombies are mostly unthreatening enemies and there's no extra chrysallid when you kill them.  It effective neuters what was one of the original games greatest threats, because of how quickly a chrysallid could ambush and spawn more chrysallids.\n\nThose gripes aside, its an engaging and well-done game which remains a time sink for me to this day.  The only turn-based strategy game in the last decade which has had me going "just one more turn"","December 4, 2013","true","291.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

You begin as a mostly weak military organization set to keep alien invasions at bay. As you complete missions and capture and examine aliens, you can research and acquire their technology to make yourself even more powerful. Begin with a group of rookies shooting with cheap assault rifles and end with a team of elite soldiers with plasma weaponry, advanced armor that lets you climb up walls, and psionic abilities to decimate alien opponents.\n\nInvestments and time management are a necessity in normal mode and absolutely critical in the game's famous "Classic" mode, which requires several difficult decisions and sacrifices to complete the game successfully. XCOM is a fun and challenging time on its own in this respect apart from the already excellent combat system.\n\nXCOM: Enemy Within is also a great "true" expansion to the game that adds lots of great weapons and story content.

As a general advice don’t get used to your buddies too much, unless you are playing on the lowest difficulty – in which case you can leave your man card on my desk on your way out. Oh and one more thing; people who fail my class get promoted to rookie status, get awarded with granddad’s old rifle and army jacket, and can go prove themselves on the front lines.\n\nStep 2 – Dig a hole\n\nWhile your less intelligent classmates are fighting on the frontlines, you will be sitting in the comfort of the anthill you call your base. Using all the technology available to man, the faceless representatives of Earth’s nations have decided to dig you a hole on a continent of your choosing, with different advantages. Europe for example will allow you to maintain your research facilities at lowered costs, while Africa will make sure that any unfortunate extraterrestrial you manage to bring home will spill their secrets much quicker. Later on you will have to dig deeper to expand your new bachelor pad. In order to give you a chance in your ongoing fight with the seemingly endless alien armada, you will have to build additional manufacturing, research and training facilities, all the while making sure you have enough energy to run the whole thing.\n\nStep 3 – Sun Tzu says…\n\nKnowing your enemy is half the battle. When fighting aliens with vastly superior numbers and technology that makes the Silicon Valley look like the arts and crafts class from fourth graders, it is pretty much the entire battle. The way ahead lies in collecting as many alien artifacts as possible, bringing back their corpses and even live specimens as time goes on. The German ex-mistress turned scientist Dr. Vahleen will “probe” these poor animals and provide you with new technologies, while the obligatory generic Japanese Dr. Shen will manufacture whatever comes out of her twisted mind. As you fight the new specimens of the alien invaders, their remains will let you upgrade your weapons and armor, produce better aircrafts, or even unlock special abilities for some of your soldiers. Falling behind on these will decrease the already small chance of survival of your faithful bullet sponges, causing you to fail essential missions.\n\nStep 4 – The coin is mightier than the sword\n\nEven though the world is about to end, nothing is free. While the visitors from outer space managed to turn back inflation by about 70 years, everything you build or develop will cost you money. Your afternoon world saving club is financed by 16 countries who are willing to pay and provide you manpower if you provide them protection. This extortion racket works as long they are actively protected. To translate, you will get payment from countries you watch over with satellites. If they get too many unregistered visitors they will “panic”. Every month the council will evaluate your performance. If the panic meter is full at the end of the month, the country will leave the project, and fend for itself. This is something you should try to avoid at all costs, because you will lose potential income and the bonus provided by protecting an entire continent. Should you get low on the almighty mulah, you have multiple options; you can sell alien parts or some of your weapons to other countries, or if they give you one, complete council missions. Managing your finances is very important even in the face of total annihilation. Running out of money while not the end of the world, makes the game a lot harder.\n\nStep 5 - Time to get technical\n\nDefending Earth in XCOM is a tough but fair experience. While the game will give you equal opportunities to smash your mouse against the wall, or shout victoriously as that damn alien’s head blows up, it is not without its flaws. Shooting through walls is common. While this is understandable with some of the later weapons, it is painful to watch as your soldier executes a fatal shot through walls they can’t even see through. The camera sometimes takes angles where nothing is visible, and no amount of rotation or zooming can make it better. Aiming with rockets or grenades is a pain to say the least, often making you miss perfectly valid shots. Needless to say, these are almost always critical situations since using explosives means losing alien artifacts. The system otherwise is fairly easy to learn, and while certain useful tricks, such as the importance of constructing the same type of buildings next to each other are easy to miss, the game tries it’s best to explain everything.\n\nThree stage plan: 1.We engage the aliens. 3. We liberate Earth and celebrate. Easy right?\n\nThe road to victory will be long, and undoubtedly challenging. I can’t promise anything but blood, toil, tears, and sweat.\nThe multiplayer option allows you and your friends to choose sides, and use those nasty alien powers on each other, while equipping everyone with that mega laser rifle you could never afford in-game. While sometimes laggy, the multiplayer works fine 90% of the time.\n\nIn conclusion, for anyone who likes turn-based tactical shooters, this alien shooting, Earth defending, base building 2K creation is a must. A true spiritual successor of the original, the game will satisfy the hardcore fans of the original, as well as newcomers to the franchise.\n","October 21, 2014","true","152.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","75","3","4","6","0"

Or, well, not really a game, more of a "say goodbye to those you love" simulator.\nIn long, XCOM: EU is an amazing top-down turn-based strategy experience which forces you to think tactically, strategically, intelligently, and I'm pretty sure all the words I just used mean exactly the same thing. Yet, I don't think I have enough words to describe XCOM. How would you describe seeing someone you trained from rookie to Grandmaster of Shotguns dying because of a cheap blow from a 1 health enemy who didn't die simply because one of your troops missed a 90% hit chance shot? Demoralizing, depressing, and yet, it doesn't stop you from carrying on, just makes you throw your last rocket at that enemy to make sure they BURN.\n(but rockets explode, they don't burn...)\nI very much enjoyed the experience of playing this game, I'd do it all over again (which I'm doing currently, just on a harder difficulty level, so that I can cry in the corner some more) and I definetly recommend it.","May 10","true","49.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","75","3","4","3","0"

Follow those rules, and you should soon find yourself having a good time.\n\nMore faithful spiritual successors to XCOM exist out there, but a big part of the fun behind XCOM: Enemy Unknown is that the process of tactical micromanagement is scaled back, and the progression towards researching fun gadgets and hardware is expedited.\n\nThe expansion pack, Enemy Within, might at first appear to lock all the goodies behind perilously tantalising resource nodes, but most players should be skilled enough to obtain a few meld canisters by the end of the first month, and the actual cost of the facilities and tech needed to convert the new currency to even bigger, shinier toys is cheaper than might be expected. Everybody can now have their very own Mecha Hitler for a low, low cost.\n\nThere isn't any point in questioning the logic of XCOM. Yes, the governments of the world are silly for expecting their ultra-elite special counter-invasion task force to fund their own operations through means tantamount to bribery, corruption and smuggling of unregulated organs and explosives to third world countries. It's also absurd that such an organisation as XCOM is only capable of recruiting raw cadets who've barely passed basic training, instead of opening up channels with the Navy SEALS, the SAS, the KGB or something. If it was up to me, then XCOM would only recruit from Nepal. Get some Gurkhas to wreck some grey meat. That said, come the end of the game, the XCOM project does appear to have an excellent knack for selecting psychics, so maybe the strategy of recruiting miopic idiot savants was smart after all.\n\nLastly, the controls can be very contrived. Sometimes you'll be fighting against the cursor to get onto the right square, as the screen keeps swapping between Z-levels. A control may work better for some people, because if your mouse button is sensitive and you sometimes misclick, then prepare to cry as your cyborg colonel sprints the full distance out into the open and spreads his cheeks for muton sausage.\n\nThis game will make you want to drop the dev team into a shark cage dangling above the eldritch shrieking of an ancient cosmic entity, but when RNGesus, or Nuffle, or whoever you pray to for high percentages is on your side, you'll feel such euphoria as your sniper gets an overwatch clutch crit on a stampeding chrysalid. Of course the damage counter will only register a 4 and the alien beast proceeds to go all Starship Troopers on your finest support medic, but hey, that's XCOM (I hate you Firaxis, xeno scum)","May 20","true","136.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

It's a fun strategy game that I found myself pretty invested in after only about an hour. While a lot of people knew what they were getting into because of the original game, I was unfamiliar with it.\n\nThe game is a fairly straightforward strategy game along with a base building element. You receive periodic funds and materials from missions to either upgrade gear for your soldiers, research technologies, and keep the world at peace with satellite coverage and UFO interception. The game does a pretty good job of making sure you aren't able (at least not easily) to do everything, so you have to somewhat plan out what you want to do in order to make sure things go smoothly.\n\nThe way the campaign progresses in pretty neat. At least, I hadn't seen it before. The game will tell you a specific thing to research, or item to build, or facility to construct, but the game doesn't seem to give you a deadline to do it. If you wanted, you could just kept the game going forever. But at the same time, going for too long without being able to protect the council/countries means that you have to keep progression in mind. It almost seems a little like Persona, of all things.\n\nThe core gameplay was pretty great, there is a ton on emphasis on positioning. Cover is basically the determinant of whether your unit will live or die. I lost 3 units pretty fast before I started being more careful. It's always really neat in these types of games to watch as units fall into roles and favorites become clear over the course the of the missions. I ended up with 2 snipers (which are fairly over powered, as everyone has probably heard) 2 supports, a heavy, and an assault. Each one ended up being used in a way that felt organic. I didn't need to meticulously plan, I just tried things to see what worked and what didn't and it all flowed so well.\n\nI wished class changes could be decided. Unsure why it had to be random. I had other issues with manual saves and weird locks up that happened if a certain outcome was forced (say, attacking two of the elites with a grenade, they normally have a reaction cutscene but didn't work with 2 of them). I also wished there were a few more things fixed in place instead of just random missions on procudural maps. The few that were there were pretty nice. Some more enemy variety would have been good too, couple annoying recolors with are just boring.\n\nOn normal, the base game got a bit easy but the last mission certainly upped the difficulty. Once you know what works, you simply just repeat it every mission while spending your money at the base. For me that meant keeping snipers back, having a shotgun running around, and a tank absorbing blows while some medics pranced about. So the game loses a little magic at this point, but luckily this is right as the campaign was ending so it didn't overstay its welcome.  I am also hopeful that the expansion content will help some of these issues. I am certainly interested in trying it at some point down the road.","February 9, 2014","true","19.8"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

This is waaay better! Manage your soldiers, assign new abilities as they increase in rank, build their weapons and shoot some aliens! No two matches feel the same, as the AI offers new challenges every time: as soon as you begin to feel comfortable there comes along a new species, forcing you to rethink your approach. What's better is that there is no single way to play the game, but you have to adapt to your base layout and to your soldiers' classes. Immersive game world, very detailed but not hard on your computer specs, so it's always very smooth. Beyond base management, research and engineering the battlefield is the game's strong point, and I guarantee you'll think the AI cheats when your colonel misses a 95% shot, and you'll swear and shout at the screen whenever your squad faces unforeseen annihilation; you will cry like a baby girl when you meet the Sectopod! Yeah, it's that immersive.\nAlso consider getting the Enemy Within DLC, it expands the game adding maps and features like genetic mods and freakin' MECHS!

The problem could be called "Streamlining" (Total War Rome 2 has this problem as well).\n\n1st is the research tree which is significantly smaller than the original. There is only one advanced Interceptor and very few weapons for it to research. The squad sizes are also very small (4-6) compared to the original so when you lose someone experienced it hurts a lot! (Losing 1 or 2 people in a mission early on can cripple your chances of completing it.) The maps are smaller and the mechanics of engaging enemies (Small groups that get their own "!" animation when you come across them) is disappointing.\n\nBase building has been made much less interesting since in the original your base could be invaded (and you could have multiple bases). The X-COM: Enemy Within expansion does actually have a base defense mission but it is scripted, happens once, and how you built your base does not come into it.\n\nWhich brings me to my main problem with the new X-COM. I do not feel like the Commander of X-COM. In the original there were no scripted events, it was all organic gameplay. I made the decisions, I hired the scientists, bought the ammo, kitted out the soldiers in details and planned ahead and I was fighting for the Earth. This may sound dull but it added to the immersion.\n\nIn the new X-COM the game plays out with 3 main characters and I feel incidental to the whole thing. I could just go put some slippers on and let them do it. You are hand-held and guided through every part of the game, constantly being told what to do, what you should do and what to expect by the "main" characters.\n\nThis game is also much shorter in terms of the time taken to complete it. I just finished a game having shot down a mere 6 UFOs. In the original I would barely be seeing more than their initial scouts at this point. The ending is also very abrupt and jarring.\n\nSo yes, this is a good game overall, it has some of the hallmarks of the original but overall it is a hollow shell compared to it, even with the expansion (Which I HIGHLY recommend). I am hoping that some of the X-COM indie games like Xenonauts ( http://www.xenonauts.com/ and early access on Steam ) can give me my real X-COM old-school fix.","November 26, 2013","true","92.9"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/JiveForceOne/recommended/200510/","JiveForceOne","Jive Force One","http://steamcommunity.com/id/JiveForceOne/","404 products in account","Pros: It has some great strategic depth to it with turn-based squad battles, and customization of your troops is more fun than it should be.  The game does a good job of putting a lot of weight into each choice you make, because you really feel it when you lose one of your soldiers, and it sucks.  Other than the occasional RNG bs crit damaging one of your guys, or causing a pointblank shot to miss, the difficulty is spot on.  You can't just rush your guys around the map and hope for the best, you actually have to think about your moves and how to win.\n\nCons: Story isn't much to tell, and is definitely not the center of the game.  There are a few minor bugs such as camera angles freaking out with the action cam, but nothing game breaking.  There is supposedly a bug in the last mission where the game will just hang up on the enemy turn (I haven't run into this myself, but I saw it happen on a livestream), but with the autosave happening every turn its more just a minor hassle to restart the game and reload the last save.\n\nOverall:  Excellent game, if you like turn-based strategy this is a must have.  While I have not played the original I have heard that it is NOT the same game, but that being said its worth it to pick up, especially on sale.\n\n8/10","November 28, 2013","true","61.6"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

And it could be soooo much better. Enter: a mod for the rescue.\n\nThe game offers a strategical management-layer with a time-compression feature and turn-based tactical missions in which you have to fight aliens with your squads. This combination works well and keeps you coming back. It starts great: there is a lot to do (research, building equipment, managing your soldiers...), the slick interface is doing its magic, you get your first valuable veterans, your abilities increase and everything is new and shiny. Nice pace and a good sense of progression.\n\nAnd then you notice the first oddities: the line-of-sight system is a joke. This game creates its very own reality and logic, but it's easy enough to adapt to this. You will get a feeling for this weird reality. The cover system works despite being laughable at times and being far from realistic.\n\nThis game has countless little weaknesses. The strategic layer suffers a bit from being extremely streamlined. The game is keeping you busy with artificial difficulty and urgency. The panic system is erratic and a big cluster♥♥♥♥ of frustrating randomness. I did not feel threatened by aliens assaulting Earth but screwed by the developers. The late-game is lacking in content, as if they made the game and then cut away the "Enemy Within" expansion. It's disappointing and left me behind unsatisfied.\n\nStill I highly recommend the game despite all its weaknesses. It's a flawed gem and it can really suck you in. The tactical missions are exciting and reward bold moves just as much as they have a tendency to punish you for not being careful. Here eliminating the randomness becomes a satisfying challenge (destroy the cover first, finish off the enemy AFTER). It gives you perks and equipment to react to new threats and keeps things interesting. On the strategical layer the rigid schedule of scripted events makes for a more beginner-friendly experience. Many people will appreciate the ease that comes with a somewhat predictable course of events. Like it always is: the strengths of the game really highlight the weaknesses. And at the end of the day it is among the limited number of games i have finished more than once without ever being bored. Just don't expect a faithful recreation of the old XCOM games.\n\nThe expansion addresses the lack of content, but most problems persist. All that being said: I highly recommend the mod "Long War" (EW required!). It overhauls the game in many aspects. It will give you a much deeper experience. It turns XCOM from an "Invasion Simulator Light" into a well thought out strategy game with a great sense of consequence. It forces you to think and actually punishes you for messing up.

Nothing wrong with that, except that many times movie/game suffers in process and its not as fun as it used to be. Good example of that seems to be Point Break (original was with Patrick Swayze, Keanu Reeves and Gary Busey) where new movie did not even come close to original.\nI used to spend hours playing original UFO (on Amiga, PS and PC) and have it played even last year with help from OpenXcom (requires original DOS files to work, updates game and makes it Win7/Win10 compatible, don't need DOSBox) and I was very wary how this new game will play, but as soon as you do tutorial you can see that many of good things from original game are back.\n\nOn positive side, there is less base management (actually, you have only 1 base to worry about) and new use of laboratory and production seems to be more developed for consoles rather then for PC, but missions are still lots of fun and there are many nice touches, like rotating camera that can follow your troop, voice and comments from troop as well aliens sounds well made.\n\nThere are some glitches (firing trough the wall and random crashes), but nothing few saves can't fix. :)\n\nIf you like turn based game with management system and alien killing fun - this is game for you!","April 12","true","50.4"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Anyway, it was a top down "tactics" game: you controlled a rag-tag bunch of Medieval fantasy-style characters on a quest to purge the darkness that had been unsealed. One of the main draws of this game (and one of the main reasons I'd still return to it in the present day) was its simplicity; you had options, but you mostly had to rely on formation and non-fog-of-war tactics to really succeed.\n\nWhile I did, as I aged, fall in love with other (console) tactics games for various reasons - Final Fantasy Tactics, Disgaea, Front Mission, Advance Wars - none of them retained the complexity of those of the earlier games in the Shining Force series (especially Shining Force II) by way of simplicity, but rather by way of introducing complex or quirky mechanics that, while amusing for the first few implementations, grew steadily into automotonic repetition... or by quasi-forcing you to grind your way to the top (You technically could grind in Shining Force, but you didn't often NEED to as much as you might in, say, Disgaea).\n\nWhich brings me to XCOM. I'd been introduced to it indirectly by a number of YouTube LPers, and fell in love with the crazy antics and frustrations they experienced... especially the ones they inflicted on themselves by hacking into the game and ramping up the difficulty beyond even that of present-day Impossible mode, just for the challenge of it. When I later saw that there was to be a new edition (and even later, saw the amazing graphics of said edition), I jumped on the bandwagon as soon as I had the time and money to do so, and I have not been disappointed.\n\nXCOM will always keep you on your toes; unless you're a master at the game playing on Easy or Normal perhaps. I myself have not yet mastered this system (years of fuddled implementations of "flanking" rules are still wreaking havoc in my brain), but success in the game relies more on simple squad tactics than it does on any sort of weird crafting, class, or combat, or other system. You need to think ahead practically all the time on the field (and off), carefully cross terrain and explore the map, and hopefully only ever uncover a group of aliens when you can actually handle them in one or two turns. Every battle challenges you to choose the right strategies every turn, whether the best option is to play more defensive or more offensive, play economically or in more of a rushdown style (either of which can backfire horribly). And because dead characters are dead... not resurrectable as they might be in the more lightweight tactics games of modern day (save Fire Emblem), I actually tend to really "care" about them. Any alien that blows up my main avatar is going to die in the most gruesome way I can manage.\n\nCoupled with an amazing combat engine, XCOM also challenges you with managing the actual base of your operation (in a much simpler and streamlined fashion than in the original), which again challenges you to think about how you ultimately want to build your base, and when to build which structure, and when to do which research, and which items or weaponry or armor or accessories to purchase or upgrade... all on a budgeted income. Perhaps it's an odd thing to say, but the limitations imposed upon you actually help to drive the game, and help to make the game an enjoyable one. While I did enjoy the slight period in time that I could relatively ROFLstomp the enemy due to overpowered weaponry, I find I still have the ability to so long as I size up the enemy first and plan intelligently my assault... it just takes a bit longer to do so.\n\nI have not played Enemy Within... but I look forward to a purchase in the near future. Still, even without the expansion, XCOM: Enemy Unknown delivers... alien heads on a platter.\n\nMmmmm. Juicy.","December 24, 2013","true","83.1"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

But I did like it and sort of was planning to get it and learn more about it to get better at it. But, that never happened. So anyway I was kind of excited about this remake or what you wanna call it. I wasn't 45 euros excited so I didn't buy it until I got it for a really good price at a steam sale. And I am glad I did. It is a good game. The gameplay is really fun and brings back a lot of memories from old turn-based games I used to play and enjoy. But at the same time it is hotted up and the graphics and style is really nice and adds to the enjoyment.\n\nI also like how the scientists and engineers talk to you about whats going and the way they are telling the story. But, there isn't really much of a story there. I really like the gameplay and the mechanics and the way the story is being told, I just wish it was more of it. If I would've paid full price for it I would've been dissapointed, I expect a lot more from a game if I pay over 40 euros.

With some games, for example the Hitman series, I'm almost exclusively interested in the systems behind the gameplay. XCOM resides in a weird spot in between. It immerses players in a tense atmosphere and at the same time presents a complex and multifaceted strategy game.\n\nIt feels nostalgic but plays modern. Some parts are generic and videogame-y, but it get's you completely immersed in the feeling of being a commander, fighting for the survival of human life on earth. It's complex, but accessible. It's a challanging game, but never unfair. It's imperssive how well every little part of this game, from the interplay of the two different strategic layers to the last piece of UI, is designed.\n\nEverytime I talk about XCOM, I can't do anything else but praise it. It's one of those games I'd give a 10/10, if I believed such ratings were adequate.

What they did in 2012 was basically resurrect  not only the forgotten turn base genre(outside Civ of course), but a series(Xcom) that had been basically left for dead and then turn it into a consensus GOTY. I have never reached 100+ hrs faster and no game has consumed my soul as much as  Xcom. This game is about patience, timing, and budgeting and thats not even describing the combat situations where one false move, just one, and i guarentee you are going to be bringing home body bags. The questions is how many?\nIf the Civilization series has been known as "one more turn" for its addictive gameplay, then Xcom's motto is "one more mission" becasue you cant stop, i dare you to try.\n\nPositives\nBeating a mission is as satisfying as a strong run in Dark Souls\nMaps, while static, are reused but from different starting points keeps the games different each playthrough.\nThe controller scheme is absolutely perfect.\nEach mission, each combat scenario never is easy.\nFrom start to finish, every decison is meaningful and possibly catastrophic at the same time.\nIts genius is the simplistic asthetic at first and then understanding the complexities as you dive deeper.\nIts brutal, but fair. Sometimes.\nI love the fact you can basically break the game by just skipping the story missions.\nThe tutorial is basic. It took me 2 playthroughs maybe 3 before i fully understood mostly everything.\n\n\nNegatives\nYou will lose sleep, possibly girfriends, friends and family. Its a soul stealing, life sucker.\nThere are bugs from sound quitting to random crashes.\nLine of sight is difficult to equate especially when flanking.\nThough you are doing missions around the world every map looks like you are in the US.\nThe elevation penalty for enemies is drastically understated when they are located below your player.\nNo way to sneak up on enemies until very, very late in game. They basically get a free turn to find cover.\nPaid $6 to customize the team with different armor colors, helmets. Totally worth it but its ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t at the same time.\nThe inventory UI is bad. Should have been a shared inventory system.\n\nMy quick tips if you are going to try iroman:\n1. Forgo armor early and build lasers\n2. Understand taking an abduction will reduce that countrys alerat status, but the others you ignore will raise their continent +2\n3. Always find Full coverage. This is a must.\n4. NEVER go down the middle of a map.\n5. Keep switching in and out team members to build a deep bench.\n6. Dont crowd squad close together, but keep them close enough they can all get a shot.\n7. If already in combat, dont move ahead further and trigger enemies hiding in fog of war. Patience.\n\n\n\n","September 27, 2014","true","137.1"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

I was looking forward to having another great strategy game in my library. It took ages, but oh, was it WORTH IT. I'm in love with this game. I really am. Would I want to marry this game if given the opportunity? YES. I just love it.\n\nThe game is fast paced, even for a strategy game, and danger lurks every corner. XCOM just says "Alright, hope you enjoyed the tutorial. Now we'e going to load you with insanely difficult missions where your squadmates might permanently die. Oh, you saved the wrong city? Too late. Game over." That is XCOM's difficulty summed up. Is this a good thing? Yes. I don't want games that "Oh, let me show you how to destroy all the aliens" and "Oh, silly, this whole game is a tutorial!" They waste my time. Recently, I've been thinking about comparing this game to Civilization V, another extremely popular turn-based strategy game. I cannot give my opinion on it yet, but I will.\n\nThe graphics are fine, no issues with it. It keeps a cartoony feel and doesn't go too far into realism. It seems a bit bright in this kind of atmosphere, but it gets the job done.\n\nI like the songs, and they match the game pretty well. Not the greatest soundtrack, but still impressive.\n\nOverall, XCOM is an extremely good game, but there is one major downside to this game: BUGS. The game crashes here and there, and it is loaded with bugs. I have issues in combat where the screen is focused only on a corner and nothing else. It gets really annoying pretty quick. One other issue I found is that sometimes when you're at your base, you're stuck there. Seriously. It freezes up. I can't think straight due to how great this game is, with the base building, the great replayabilty, awesome gameplay, and lots more. If this game had no bugs, it would be perfect.\n\nI would definitely recommend this game. Aside from a couple of issues, XCOM is a great reboot to an amazing series. With it's strong replayability and awesome turn based combat, Enemy Unknown shows to be one of the finest games of 2012.\n\nGraphics- 7.5/10\nGameplay- 9/10\nStory- 7.5/10\nAudio- 8.5/10\nReplayability- 9.5/10\n\n\n.:8.4/10:.\n+Intense gameplay\n+Base building\n+Lots of unique enemies\n+Challenging and addictive\n-Bugs everywhere\n-Crashes often\n-Visuals can seem bright at times","March 13, 2014","true","29.6"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

Somehow they feel slow, and I just want to unwind without thinking about things too much. But Xcom managed to pull me right in. It succesfully mixes turn based strategy with a bit of management, and,... guess what ? It's great fun !\n\nXcom uses a certain graphical style, which reminded me a bit of Team Fortress 2. It's not super detailed by any means, but I still liked the clean look of things.\n\nThe combat is brilliant, with the camera zooming in when a certain action is taken. It makes the combat feel exciting. Completing missions and killing enemies will level up your soldiers. You'll learn to take care of them, because when they're a higher level some of their abilities might just save you and your squad.\n\nThe story is nothing special, but the way the whole game is executed is just amazing. You'll have to make some difficult choices (concerning building certain items/facilities and the missions you choose to accept), none of which are right or wrong.\n\nThe sounds and music also add to the atmosphere of the entire game.\n\nAlso, for a single-player game it's surprisingly lenghty as well. It should take most players well over 20 hours to complete, especially if you mess up your first few games (like me).\n\nHighly recommended !\n\n[Rating: 90/100]","November 11, 2012","true","26.0"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

Is this bad ? In my opinion not. XCOM: Enemy Unknown is faster and action pumped as his ancestors. Most important for myself is, that the new XCOM has not so many Horror or shocking moments like for example when your solider is shot from the unknown. Now its only about strategy and action and I love it. Sure things like the old inventory or AP System are missing but after some time you wont miss it anymore.\n\nLet's get to facts like Gameplay, Music and Graphic.\n\nThe gameplay for itself is very good and easy to understand. The tutorial will also show you the most important moves and strategies.\nThe Music, especially "Deployment" is one of the best gaming music tracks.

The "spotted enemies get a free turn so often they can just move to flank/surround your squad and murder them freely in their turn" rule is enough for it to be shown in a circus to be poked with sticks and laughed at. The classic difficulty is not classic at all, it's just a losing game against rng roulette where aliens get instakill crits from maximum distance while your guize have 40% hit while standing two meters away, because "hardocre yo!".\n\nDue to the above the game can randomly just lose itself for you. Example: one of these mind-numbingly boring VIP search and rescue council missions. I spot the VIP. I have to approach him for him to notice me. I cannot approach him without triggering two thin men spawns (that get a free turn). After I approach him, I cannot move him to a place where he won't be hit with a poisoning attack. After he gets poisoned, he panics. After he panics, he gets one-shot by one of the thin men that literally fall from the sky behind my line in automatic overwatch. Mission failed. 8/10, would rage again.\n\nThe tactical battle mechanics have literally nothing to do with classic UFO games bar the "secret organization fights aliens in turns" premise. Even the most basic stuff like being able to shoot whenever and at whatever you want is not there. Instead, the game carbon copies the core mechanics (one move-one attack instead of ap, no free movement, 4 slot "inventory", attacking through skills with "action camera" animations and so on) from the so-called tactical jrpgs. Which is not surprising, considering this is a console game after all.\n\nThe strategic layer is more akin to EU, but of course horribly castrated with things like one base, one skyranger, one (scripted) alien base etc., because that's apparently what 20 years of advancements in gaming brings us.","June 4, 2014","false","34.3"," 106 of 207 people (51%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","51","106","207","6","15"

It is absolutely a fantastic game and there is a good reason why it is so widely recommended. HOWEVER, I encountered so many rage inducing bugs and glitches that I cannot, in good faith, recommend  XCOM: Enemy Unknown. Enemies appearing out of thin air and killing nearby squadmates, a bizarre glitch that happens when you try to perform an action and then reload your weapon causing you to have to reload the mission, because you then cannot perform any further actions, and finally percentage values for aiming that are inaccurate. (I missed three shots that were 100% back to back to back). The saddest part is that, according to fans, many of these issues are solved if you fork out the cash for the expansion. It's not worth my keyboard, mouse, or a hole in the wall from these rage inducing issues. Considering I purchased the game years after release there is no chance that these bugs will be fixed unless I want to pay for an expansion that supposedly fixes these issues.","October 23, 2014","false","12.8"," 26 of 50 people (52%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","52","26","50","0","0"

This time aliens have invaded Earth and are generally up to no good, and it's your job as Commander to stop them.\n\nThe game is turn based strategy through and through, although you do have to manage your base and your finances. You do this by keeping countries happy, which reduces panic, which in turn earns you cash. As you defeat the aliens you gain access to their technology which you can study and adapt to you own needs.\n\nMost of the game-play elements from the classic series make a return, meaning that you will have to manage your base, keep an eye out for alien craft, build whatever you need and control any research whilst keeping a tight grip on your finances. As you progress your soldiers will become more skilled and generally more powerful, and as your study continues and gain access to more powerful equipment.\n\nThe game has multi-player too, so you can fight against human players as well as the computer controlled opponents. When you do send you soldiers to fight each player is given a “turn” in which to move or shoot. The the general rule is that you have to find cover, and then shoot back. Your squad has other skills which you can use to adapt to the enemy's strategy. There are a lot of different aliens to blast, some of which are quite tough, especially in groups.\n\nThe game can be easily played with a controller or the more traditional keyboard and mouse. The game has a sort of way-point system which snaps to a grid. This works well for the most part, but the cursor can sometimes sort of “twitch” which means that your soldiers don't quite go where you want them to and crucially are not in cover. If you take you time and make sure it's where you want it before you click then it's OK.\n\nGraphically the game is quite attractive although a little simple looking. Having said that most of the action takes place from an overhead perspective, and there can be a lot of enemies on screen – especially in the later missions. The maps are not overly large, but are well designed and have many different features to take advantage of, giving you a lot of options during combat. Having said that there aren't really that many and you will fight in the same areas over and over – even if they are supposed to be different countries.\n\nThe game should keep you busy for a while as there is plenty to do and an alien plot to uncover, but the small control problem and the limited locations can make it a little frustrating.","December 1, 2014","true","144.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
