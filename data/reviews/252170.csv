Anomaly: Warzone Earth Mobile Campaign is a Tower Offense game, instead of the traditional Tower Defence games. This makes the Anomaly Franchise stand out of other games.\n\nWith that said, the original intention of creating Anomaly: Warzone Earth Mobile Campaign is to be played on mobile devices, rather than on a PC. As this is a game meant for mobile devices, it is pretty much the same as the original Anomaly: Warzone Earth, just that you would realise that there are no keyboard shortcuts, making it unfriendly for PC gaming.\n\nFor PC gaming, my recommendation would be to get Anomaly: Warzone Earth, instead of Anomaly: Warzone Earth Mobile Campaign as I find the PC version more enjoyable and with keyboard shortcuts, making the overall gameplay more convenient rather than having to use the mouse all the time.","January 1, 2015","false","0.1"," 21 of 25 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","21","25","0","0"

If you have already played the PC version of this game, you may wonder what the developers wanted to achieve by doing so, since the game adds nothing new to the original concept or storyline. This game differs from its PC kin in that, owing to a mobile keypad's limited control abilities,  there is no commander to guide its cavalry. Consequently, the way the Hacker and the Energizer work is also slightly different.\n\nUnless you want to be able to tell everyone that you've played this game and know what it's like, don't spend your money on this. Buy the PC version instead. It's much more interesting and offers longer gameplay.","November 26, 2013","true","13.6"," 17 of 20 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","17","20","0","0"

It's more of a re-hash of the same story, abbreviated, for those who haven't seen the story before (in the full "Anomaly Warzone Earth").  Which is understandable as the "...Mobile Campaign" was likely introducing the story to the mobile market.  However, perhaps being a mobile-targeted app, the campaign is short.  I was able to complete the entire 12 mission campaign in approx 2.5hrs, not defeating every turret on every map, but nearly so.\n\nAnyway, I got used to the massive sized-for-smartphone buttons (having also played "Anomaly: Korea" which is also a smartphone-targeted game) so that part of the controls weren't too annoying for me.  Quality-wise, to me, this game seemed a little better than Korea.  In fact, this was almost as good as the full "Anomaly: Warzone Earth" game.\n\nOn the plus side, I liked not having the separate commander run around and get lost in all the action on the screen.\n\nIn the end, the Mobile Campaign is worth a play if you really like the Anomaly game series.  7 out of 10.","January 21, 2015","true","3.4"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","0"

Idea of reverse Tower Defense game is great. So, how is Mobile Campaign? It feels so good, like normal game. Really. Think of it as of DLC, or maybe extra chapter, for base game. Sure, maybe it's more easy than original, it have those annoying TAP this, TAP that, things but that's all. If you enjoyed first Anomaly game then you should play Mobile Campaign. And if you never heard or played any Anomaly games, then start from beggining.

The biggest difference is you don't have the commander unit running around, but you can still deploy powers like repair and air strike by just clicking where you want to use them.\n\nThe campaign is quite short at 2.5 hours, there is an extra wave based mode but except for the lack of commander, its identical to the same mode in the original game. I didn't encounter any bugs, but there's a lack of keyboard short cuts compared to the original, clearly influenced by the mobile control scheme.\n\nOverall its worth playing if a) you enjoyed the original game and b) you pick it up on sale - I recently bought it for 90% off which seems like a fair price.","November 11, 2015","true","5.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Anomaly: Warzone Earth Mobile Campaign is a Tower Offense game, instead of the traditional Tower Defence games. This makes the Anomaly Franchise stand out of other games.\n\nWith that said, the original intention of creating Anomaly: Warzone Earth Mobile Campaign is to be played on mobile devices, rather than on a PC. As this is a game meant for mobile devices, it is pretty much the same as the original Anomaly: Warzone Earth, just that you would realise that there are no keyboard shortcuts, making it unfriendly for PC gaming.\n\nFor PC gaming, my recommendation would be to get Anomaly: Warzone Earth, instead of Anomaly: Warzone Earth Mobile Campaign as I find the PC version more enjoyable and with keyboard shortcuts, making the overall gameplay more convenient rather than having to use the mouse all the time.","May 14","false","7.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
