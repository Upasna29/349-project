The game looks good and the audio is crisp and clean, the mutators are a integral part of the game and makes the game so much fun, you chose from 3 different random options and there are plenty of those to keep it random and fun at the same time.\n\nThis game was relaunched after a long time due to the old publishers (THQ) shutting down the servers as they went bankript which is a shame, the problem still with the game is that it still has optimization issues and the biggest problem of populated servers, the game literally has 8-10 people playing at during its peak while has even zero during down time which is a real shame coz this is one of those highly underrated titles that i am sure many people would love to play as we dont have many mp games in the similar genre these days.","March 21","true","5.8"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

If you're a fan of old-school Arena FPS such as Quake you will absolutely love this. This game is the Quake of modern times and needs a bigger userbase. If you like the genre, BUY IT!\nThe movement system of this game is possibily the smoothest and nicest one I've ever seen. It's even better than Quake's movement system. You have an extreme control of your trajectory in mid air, for example you can rotate by 90 degrees in mid air and change your trajectory with a sharp turn. You can accelerate slightly by jumping (similar to bunnyhopping).\nThe maps are AWESOME and there is custom maps support - users can create their own maps and share them with the community.\nThe graphics are next-gen but I don't really care, I prefer keeping them at minimum because all the nextgen effects and shading distract me.\nFor the first time ever, I like a modern game as much or even more than Quake, trust me.","August 22, 2012","true","19.3"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","6","7","2","0"

Sure the graphics are obviously great but the "arena shooter" elements aren't that good compared to past games that did it right, namely Quake 3 Arena and Unreal Tournament 2004. Guess Nexuiz is a b@stard child of Quake 3 vs UT2004.\n\nCurrently, I can't find myself to like Nexuiz. The weapons are uninspired, the maps are not memorable and very tiny 4vs4 arena. Since the game doesn't have a map editor, I bet MAP PACKS will be the CoD standard.\n\nOVERALL:\nNexuiz is a bland game with cool mutators that save's it from mediocrity. But you'd be better playing other alternatives instead which are far from lacking from F2P FPS games to older arena shooters like Quake 3, Quake Live and Unreal Tournament (any edition would do).\n\nRECOMMENDATION:\nThe best recommendation I can give you is play QUAKE LIVE, which is FREE and the gameplay is much better than Nexuiz... and with MORE MAPS and Players!\n\nRATING:\n5.0 / 10","May 21, 2012","false","1.3"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","2"

I even sat in an empty server for 3 hours waiting for someone to join but it never happened, without players there's no real point in picking this up.\n\nAside from that there are some other issues too, the weapons all kinda look the same and hud  (especially the weapon indicators) are in a really bad spot.  The mutators feature while interesting for about 5 minutes gets annoying fast and i can't really see keeping that on ever.  Visually the game kinda looks cluttered, not nearly as bad as most modern fps games but still a huge step down in visual clarity from nex classic/UT99-2004 (think oversaturated overdetailed maps like the stock UT3 ones where the details just end up getting in the way of playing)\n\nMight be worth picking up cheap if a community ever starts to form, but honestly it seems almost too late at this point.","March 23","false","0.6"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","0"

It's the kid that tries to dress like Quake and Unreal Tournament and hang out with them... but he's way too immature to pull that off.\n\nIt tries to call itself a competitive shooter bringing the MP arena fighting back however it falls flat on it's face.\n\nIt relies too much on random events to be a serious competitive shooter. A competitive game should have as little randomization as possible so it can be mastered through hard work and not "luck".\n\nGraphic wise it does look good, which tells me that they should have paid more attention to the gameplay than the graphics.\n\nI don't recommend this game at all. It's not even that fun to play it with friends... Just go play the original Quake Arena , Unreal Tournament or even Shoot Mania.\n\nThis one is trying too hard.","July 19, 2012","false","0.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

As a standalone purchase however, this game has an insufficient player base to justify the expense.\n\nI suggest to the developers:\n\n1. Hold some Nexuiz events to better market this older title\n\n2. Decrease the stand-alone price and/or add in some additional DLC (between your more active projects) to increase it's cost vs. benefit rating\n\n3. Actively seek to include the title in other bundles to increase availability and perhaps expand the player base (I acquired the game via the Cryengine dev pack on Humble bundle for example).\n\nI am changing the rating on this review to a positive one--as I do find myself playing the game and that, unto itself, speaks volumes.\n\nThird impressions:\n\nNexuiz is slowly growing on me. No real online multi-player (lack of population). Still having issues with aiming--given run/jump speeds etc. I have yet to receive any medals--so I believe this remains glitched and may have to be worked around for the achivement to trigger for pokemon purposes. Fun for short bursts, but still can't recommend it as an individual purchase at this time.\n\nSecond impressions:\n\nCTF is definately the best match type so far--such has remained enjoyable.\n\nHitbox/accuracy remains an issue--the raw/base movement of characters still seems to surpass actual projectile speed (does not seem to be a lag/graphic setting issue, but more play is needed).\n\nMutators are enjoyable and afford an excellent, and in a couple instances--funny, variation to some of the other arena games I have played.\n\nTried some online quick matches. Player population remains very limited. One game was fine (albeit a loss) the other has me questioning how prevalent hacking is amonst the minute player base (1-2 shot kills 8 times in a row within 10s of respawning, and whilst on the run, seems a tad high--but then I am new to this product. However, such was not noticed in any bot matches or my other online/pvp matches to date).\n\nFirst impressions:\n\nAcquired via the Cryengine Humble Bundle.\n\nMaps are generally well designed. CTF is fun, however, DM is, unfortunately, quite bland.\n\nBoth CTF and DM suffer, from what is intended to be a feature, by the ADHD style of movement within Nexuiz. Yes it is fast paced, but so much so that it is more about "spray and pray" than actual aiming/accuracy.\n\nThe frequency of powerups/drops et al. is also very high on the maps I've explored to date. This makes resource conservation of little value, thus far, and further supports the "spray and pray" style.\n\nIf you want arena combat, akin to Speedy gonzales running around with a rocket launcher, then Nexuiz fits the bill.\n\nI remain hopeful I'll see some value, beyond achievement collecting, in Nexuiz and I will update this review accordingly as additional play time is logged.","March 29","true","13.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

There are several unique weapons rannging from the nex, your classic railgun sniper to the rocket launcher. Thus far the game has 3 modes.\n\nCapture the flag and team dm being the standard modes with a DLC that adds in 1v1 duel mode. Ontop of that you can pick up mutators which change how the game is played by making everything black and white, making your opponets mute so they cant hear and adding in the dev's floating heads that shoot lazers. Around the map there are armour pick up sort of like in quake which are essential to your survival.\n\nAll and all I enjoyed playing this game, there are a few bugs and the lack of a community and difficulty finding a game with more then 3 people but if you have a friend to play with i reccomend this game though if your looking to play online I wouldn't bother picking it up due to lack of community.","August 2, 2012","true","11.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The Quakeish feel is still there, but it feels somewhat bloated now. It is however more likely to attract the new generation of gamers with aforementioned in-your-face graphics and dubstep-filled loading screens.\n\nIf you're looking for yet another reaction shooter and don't mind recycled content or just have the desire to pay more for the polished look, go for it.

As is often the case with tournament combat games, the backstory is paper thin and serves only to briefly explain the futuristic setting.  While the combat is quick paced, and there are a variety of fun mutators like super jumps or unlimited ammo, the game unfortunately looks and feels almost identical to Unreal Tournament 2004.  This may not be a bad thing for fans of the genre because the game will immediately feel familiar, but I found myself growing bored quickly and the lackluster weapon effects and HUD did not do much to encourage my enthusiasm.  That said, it is a competent entry in the genre but the lack of a single player campaign, steep system requirements, and rather lackluster gameplay should keep all but genre diehards away.","July 20, 2012","true","1.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If 8 friends want to get together and just blast and have goofy fun, then ok but serious competitors, steer clear. Now that a patch has been released the gameplay is smooth and the weapons work well.

It's a pretty competent little arena shooter, here's some quick pros and cons:\n\nPros:\n+Pretty nice looking, especially given it's age.\n+Gun mechanics are solid and consistent, a must for any arena shooter.\n+Map design is pretty solid.\n+Bots are present and provide a decent amount of challenge if you crank the difficulty up.\n\nCons:\n-Not really any players at all. Which sucks, because this game has competitive potential. You'll be playing bots or your friends who own the game, and not really anyone else.\n-Menus are bland and often confusing to use, especially so when setting up custom matches.\n-Occasional bugs, nothing game breaking however.\n\nQuestionable Things:\n-The randomized mutators. While they are fun, you have to turn them off to get any true competitive play, because their random nature upsets the game balance more often than not.\n\nSo, all in all, it's a competent game. I recommend it because it does have bot play, and it's not too pricey. It'll at least scratch your arena shooter itch until UT4 comes out of Alpha.\n\n","March 15","true","1.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Now if only all the players would come back to populate the servers...\n\nWhether you like the game comes down to only 1 thing: how much you like the crazy Nexuiz mutators. These change the game drastically, sometimes affecting all players. Of course, there are also game modes without these mutators, but this is what makes the game special.\n\nSome examples:\n\n- All players get jetpacks.\n- Controls are inverted for everyone!\n- 1 random player loses his weapons and becomes a living bomb. You can kill lots of players with a kamikaze (although most of the time it's rather annoying)\n- Color blind mutator literally changes everything to a greyscale. You'll have trouble telling teams apart. Friendly fire is on.\n- Everyone can only use melee for a few secs\n- Ground suddenly feels like ice and everyone is sliding (careful around edges ^^)\n- Nuke. Everyone dies, then respawns.\n- Invulnerability (only you)\n- You get Strength (double damage)\n- You get your favorite weapon.\n- Shooting teammates now heals them instead!\n...\n\nThere's many more (about 50?). The global mutators take turns in a stack. The stack can be cleared too. Mutators affecting only you take effect instantly when you pick em up, I believe...\n\nHonestly, it's chaotic as hell and a lot of these mutators are rather unwelcome (kamikaze and nuke). But if you like chaos, you will like this.","June 5","true","3.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
