It feels like a vertical R-Type with a late 8-bit/early 16-bit feel to it. The gameplay feels like a good starting point for players who are just getting into the genre and don't want to have a wall of bullets thrown at their face. It also offers just enough difficulty in the later stages in normal mode to keep things interesting for novice players like myself. The hard difficulty is where players with a little more skill than myself will find their fun since normal mode is pretty much 1CC'able first time around for expert players.\n\nThe music is also pretty darn good and really gives an older play like myself a warm and fuzzy sense of nostalgia when playing. The sound effects also sound like something straight from a classic shooter from the yester-years. Overall I think the sound and music for the game are spot on and go great with the aesthetics.\n\nWeapon variety in this game feels great and weapons don't feel thrown in just for the sake of choice. The play gets to choose from 3 charge attacks in the beginning. Each attack comes with pros. The Megashot, for example, stops your ship upon fire rather due to kickback, but grants you a huge damage boost. The weapon upgrades feel great and all have different damage levels along with utility that make certain situations more tolerable.\n\nThe game is pretty bare when it comes to configurations. To put the game into TATE you have to set your monitor to landscape. This isn't a big issue, but people will find this annoying. The game also automatically scales to your current monitor resolution instead of allowing you to select it. The game itself runs fantastic. These are issues to be expected from a game made by a ridiculously small team with a micro budget.\n\nOverall this is a solid purchase for those looking to scratch that shmup itch.","February 28","true","3.2"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

I've expressed my preference for the former in previous reviews here on Steam, so I'm always delighted when new ones show up that are well crafted. "Battle Crust" delivers on that front. “Vertical R-Type” has been the common description for it, which pretty apt. The controls are pretty simple, one button for regular shooting and one button for charge shots. In order to use the charge shot, you need to have collected at least one power up. It's straightforward enough where someone can pick up and play it very easily. In addition, adhering to the classic style shmup formula, there are multicolored powerups to collect that transform your standard pea shooter into an assortment of different weapons with strengths and weakness. The game does a good job of placing these accordingly, tailored to whatever is going on while you are playing. It's easy to recover you charge shot upon death, and you never feel like you have to rely on your weak default weapon for too long. You can also select from three different charge shots upon starting (and continuing), which have different properties, and change the flow of the game accordingly.\n\nThe game is pretty well designed and telegraphed, so you never feel like your deaths are unfair. Skilled shump players, however, who habitually single credit Cave shooters and the like would likely find the challenge lacking except on hard maybe, and consider it a sour point. For others, it will be challenging enough (I'm just now getting to last stage on Easy on a credit, to give you an ideal of my skill level), and thus best suited for more casual players, beginners, or people nostalgic for classic shooters. The presentation is enough of a draw for groups outside of this to at least check it out though.\n\nAnd then there's the music, done by my personal favorite VGM composer Hyakutaro Tsukumo. Previously known for his works with the defunct company Technosoft ("Thunder Force V" chief among them), and more recently for his soundtracks to indie dev Dracue Software's run and gun mech games, such as "Gunhound EX" (also on Steam). Instead of employing his usual over-the-top modular synth rocking that defines lots of his works, he opted to compose the soundtrack with old school FM synthesis to match the classic theme of the game. Despite the retro, chiptune sound, the music still has a lot of the rock and roll grooves and melodic, bombastic highs common in Tsukumo's style. On the whole, it is very well done, and a soundtrack release is the only thing I'd like to see from this down the road, because I think it deserves one.\n\nThe release itself is pretty spartan, since it was apparently self published by a sole Japanese developer, so it lacks things like achievements, and it has a few configuration oddities to navigate since they aren't in the game itself. Still, the game itself is solid, and definitely worth the value at 8 bucks.","February 28","true","7.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"
