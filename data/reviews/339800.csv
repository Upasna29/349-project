Having only ever dated men, I was very eager to learn more about the experience of dating women and, on this front, found the game very enlightening! I learned a great many things about dating women, such as:\n\nAll women become cranky when hungry and will not speak to you until you buy them food.\nAfter 4 dates, women will send you unsolicited explicit photos even when you never respond to their texts.\nAuthenticity is your enemy. You should only express opinions you think the woman in question also holds.\nWomen enjoy racially-appropriate gifts, regardless of context or previously expressed interest. Also: giving an Indian woman a Native American dress qualifies as "racially-appropriate."\nAfter completing HuniePop I feel like I now have greater insight into dating and sexual politics. I have learned valuable lessons I can apply to my own relationships to become a better romantic partner.

How do I put this.\n\nI showed this to my friends because I thought it was a train wreck of a game, yeah? Turns out one of them had enough disposable income and enough deep seated hatred of me to actually buy it out of the blue for me.\nMy screams of anguish echoing through the house, I installed it while he cackled maniacally in my ear. Then, through Steam's wonderful beta features, I streamed it and he watched me play.\n\nI won't lie: It's a funny game. Throw all the logic you've got stored in your brain case out, and it's good for that at least. The puzzles ramp up strangely well, though really, I'm ♥♥♥♥ing awful at games like that and am not a good metric for the difficulty of them in the slightest. There's racism, specifically from your bubblegum fairy friend, and all the girls are less human beings and more charicatures of what certain human cliques are supposed to be, but that's alright: It makes it even funnier, as long as you don't take it seriously. By the time another friend started watching me play, I was invested, and the three of us laughed our asses off constantly (partially due to our own commentary, partially due to the game).\n\nIt's not BAD. But then again, I'm the kind of person who sits on Newgrounds playing ♥♥♥♥♥♥ flash games all day, so I'm not exactly smart. I will say, however, that it's not some kind of spectacular rainbow coated super game: It's funny. The puzzles are challenging, for lobotomized dickmonkeys like me, and what more do you want? I mean, it's got blatant objectification of women, but we've already established that if you're going to play this you need to turn off the logical and reasonable parts of your brain and basically just go with it.\n\nIf you're the kind of person who's open minded and doesn't get offended easily and you desperately need something to do because, like me, your standard hobbies are slowly becoming less and less fulfilling as you descend into the maw of inevitable insanity, go for it.\n\nIf you're literally anybody else, then take any recommendations with a grain of salt: It's certainly not something everybody will find as amusing as I did.","January 19, 2015","true","28.7"," 1,484 of 1,612 people (92%) found this review helpful 957 people found this review funny","92","484","1","957","25"

A game where you ask girls how big their honkers are, get them drunk, then try to Candy Crush your way to their climax? Really? Yep, really. And it works great.\n\nI started out my adventure deciding I would try to get it on with both of the blondes. My plan works great, until I ask them both their family names and realize they are mother and daughter. I don't know whether to cry or to get turned on. In my confusion I decide to just keep going. Unlocking the secret characters was great fun.\n\nThis game is incredibly sarcastic, and has a lot of great references. Let me paraphrase one of them to you: "Guys keep asking me to put a shoe on my head, I don't get it." The girls in this game are objectified and stereotyped on a large scale, but it's done in a satirical way.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/willizord/recommended/339800/","willizord","willizord","http://steamcommunity.com/id/willizord/","377 products in account","This is a game about lying to women as much as you possibly can so you can eventually have sex with them. Your character (who can be male or female, so that's nice) wakes up at the prodding of a voyeuristic nymphomaniac fairy who really, REALLY wants you to get laid. She teaches you the secret to becoming both a dating master and a sex machine... that secret being a metric ♥♥♥♥-ton of "Bejeweled". Of course.\n\nThe gameplay is just about everything you can expect from the rather niche "Puzzle Dating Sim" genre. You match tiles, you buy gifts, and you ask/answer the most inane questions the writers could dream up. Your character hasn't got a job: Mr./Ms. Protagonist literally makes all of his/her money from dating women. That's right, your dates are so grateful for your time and your puzzle skills that they'll literally pay you to date them. It leaves one to wonder how the protagonist fed him/herself before a fairy showed up to teach them the ins and outs of dating for cash.\n\nThe girls are likable enough. Even the one that is intentionally unlikable. However, they all unfortunately suffer from crippling Alzheimer's, and will often ask you the same question two or three times in a single hangout session. God forbid you ask them a question more than once, though. Be sure to remember every minute detail they tell you, because you will be quizzed.\n\nEven the most promiscuous of these women will only put out after your fourth successful date with them, and only at night. The resulting "sex scenes" involve playing even more Bejeweled while your partner moans and eventually climaxes at how incredibly hot it is. Their fetish for matching tiles is only matched by the deep shame you'll feel for playing this game.\n\nAt the risk of making you feel dirty whenever you play "Candy Farm Crush Saga Heroes 3: Reloaded" (Though let's be honest, you already do), there is an uncensor patch for this game. It's incredibly easy to find and to install.\n\nI recommend this game under these conditions:\n\n-Is the game on sale?\n-Are you an unabashed weeaboo?\n-Are you fine with having a softcore porn game in your library?\n-Do you want to bang a transdimensional fairy who's old enough to be your great-grandma's great-grandma?\n\nIf you answered "yes" to any of those questions, then you probably already own this game.

In fact, it becomes much more difficult.\n- Chicks dig pretenders. Do NOT try to be yourself. Trust me, it's not gonna work.\n- It's completely OK to ask questions about weight and bra size. Girls expect you to do so.\n- There is little to no reason to ever have anything to do with someone you've already banged. Move on.\n\nHuniePop is pretty much your regular light dating sim. You ask girls generic questions, they in return quiz you to find out if you've paid any attention at all and in the end, if done correctly, you've humped every girl in town. For some reason though it feels more fun than dating sims usually. I'm still trying to determine if it actually is more fun or am I just being fooled to think so.\n\nIf you've played any dating sim before, especially any western-made, you've seen most of this game already. First you're introduced with your mission to get down with every girl you meet. Sometimes it's because you're trying to win a bet, sometimes you're doing it just for the hell of it, sometimes you're getting revenge, and so on, and so on. This time the reason is a magic fairy who comes to your aid because you're a pathetic mess and need to get some poon-tang ASAP. Then you run rampant around the town meeting girls and memorizing trivia you learn from them. Wooing the girls can be made easier by handing them various obtainable gifts.\n\nWhat's different in this game is dating. Instead of putting anything you've learned in actual use, you're playing a round of Bejeweled... Candy Crush... You know, that puzzle game where there's a board full of bricks of different colors and you're supposed to swap bricks to create lines of three or more of same color. You need to get certain amount of points and you have 20 turns to do so. If you succeed, date is successful and your prey likes you a little bit more. However, every time you win a date game, next date becomes more difficult with higher target score. You can improve your in-game skills to get point multipliers, but at some point you're likely to find yourself in a situation where every move has to be magnificent. There's no time limit though, and sooner or later you're gonna understand why.\n\nOnce you've managed to bend your target under your will, it's time to move to your bedroom. Again you're facing your nemesis, the bling-bling puzzle game, but this time it's slightly different. You have unlimited moves, but your score keeps running down to zero. In order to reach your target you need to score faster than your points decrease. During this your conquest stands next to you in her underwear moaning. It's rather peculiar portrayal of intercourse, I must say. It makes you feel like you're rolling all over the place like a tornado, trying to twist and tweak everything you can, as fast as you can. If you can conjure a hysteric state of mind at will, it will be extremely helpful.\n\nThe game is put together very well. Graphics are pretty, background music can run hours without becoming annoying and voice acting is a lot better than you would expect, although sometimes it's difficult to believe that every girl has their own voice actress. Girls have extremely different, yet quite stereotypical personalities. Dialogue varies from hilarious to awkward to annoying, so a lot, but thanks to voice acting you don't want to skip any of it (unless you really hate the girl in question).\n\nThere are some minor nuisances. Once you've done the deed with a girl, there isn't any reason to interact with her again. There are some minor details like costumes and hairstyles you can always try to unlock but nothing that affects gameplay and nothing that matters at all in any way if you're not gonna see that girl anymore, and again, why would you? Item inventory has less space than there are items to obtain. For some reason this becomes quite annoying, especially because there is absolutely no reason to limit the size of inventory. Also, there are Steam cards but no achievements. Personally I would've picked achievements over trading cards, but that's just me.\n\nI still don't know for sure whether HuniePop really is fun or just masked as fun. I'm playing it hours at a time, but I'm not exactly sure why. It doesn't really bring anything new to the table. It doesn't offer anything I haven't yet seen. If you're familiar with dating sims this one is going to feel familiar right off the bat. I recommend this game, but ONLY if you like the genre or want to find out what dating sims are. Even though it's very generic, it's still very well made and an excellent example of a dating sim. If you've tried dating sims before and haven't liked them, this one is not gonna change that opinion.","January 22, 2015","true","33.9"," 509 of 551 people (92%) found this review helpful 224 people found this review funny","92","509","551","224","5"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/presidentgoku/recommended/339800/","presidentgoku","President Honoka","http://steamcommunity.com/id/presidentgoku/","850 products in account","When I bought this game, I was not expecting much from it, in fact, I thought it would be nice if I can get around an hour or something. But damn, was I wrong. To be honest, I was really surprised by the fact that the game was actually well made. I'm assuming the game was made by an American developer, and yet, they really seem to understand waifu, moe and hentai factors that exist in the current hentai anime trend. Is that a good thing? For someone like me, yes ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)\n\nIt is basically Bejeweled with dating sim, and my goodness the game is just well made in every possible way.\n\nSince It is basically Bejeweled, if you know how to play that, then you should be able to play. But there are things that you must remember, such as which jewels give you what kind of effects. And honestly, it took me some time to master that, but you should be able to find out eventually as you keep playing. The game gets pretty challenging as it goes, so you will need to get good items and such to make the game easier.\n\nAnd honestly, I would've just given up on the game if it were not for the whole real good dating stuff you can do in the game. You actually can buy girls gifts to please them and also you can get more love from your girls by giving them the right answers to their questions. And by this, it felt as though I actually was dating them, I somehow ended up memorizing those girls' birthdays, last names, etc (Sad, I know -_- but you will be, too ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) )\n\nAlso, I noticed you actually can get...panties, PANTSU of each girl when you sleep with them. My goodness, can this game get anymore hentai than this? I honestly thought it was such a neat idea, taking away their pantsu. What do those pantsu do? Well, you can use them to unlock something, but in most cases, they are basically meant to be the medals of honor ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) I always take a look at those pantsu to make me feel proud of myslef ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)v\n\nAnd I thought it was pretty nice to see that the game has 3 secret girls that you can unlock. I mean seriously? 3 more waifus? ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)b\n\nAll I can say is, this game needs a sequel. We want the sequel....no, "I" want the sequel. The only complaint I have would be that, the girls you see in the game and the girls you see on artworks are somewhat kind of different looking. So I really wish this could be fixed in the next game.\n\n\nRating:\n\nI have disappointed my parents out of 10.\n\n\n日本語レビュー\n\n簡単に言えばBejeweledです。しかし、女の子たちとのデートシミュレーションがメインなゲームであり、彼女たちがする質問にちゃんと答えたりとかプレゼントを上げたりとかしなきゃ先に進めないし、絶対購入者のほとんどはそれが目当てでしょうに。( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)\n\nゲーム自体はパズルの面で少しずつ難しくなるため、アイテムやステータスを上げる必要があります。きっと途中でやめたくなるかもしれません。「難しすぎる・・・」となってもうここで終わりにしようかとも思ってしまうかもです。しかし、このゲームでは彼女のハートをゲッツし、彼女たちと甘い夜を過ごした後に彼女たちのパンティー（！！！）をゲッツすることができるのです。こんな変態ゲーが今まであったでしょうか？パンティーのとこを見ても「彼女が君と一緒に寝たときに履いてたパンティー」とかマジで完全もうエロ過ぎてあれだよな？何このゲームめっちゃ何かよく分かってるな、おい、マジかよ？何かもう、女の子のパンティーをコレクションできるってどんだけエロいんだよ、開発者、俺もう１２枚集めたからシェンロン呼んで良い？良いよね？（崩壊）\n\n・・・・とにかく、このゲームはそういうヘンタイストたちの心を揺さぶるものがあるのです。問題点と言ったらまぁ、これは日本語が無いと思うので英語ができなきゃちょっとこれを完全に楽しむのは難しいかもです。ちなみに、このゲームには隠しキャラが３人います。そしてその中の一人がネコの女の子で、英語でご主人様になってとか言ってきます（興奮）もう何このゲーム？めっちゃよく分かってんな？おい、こんな子とデートするんだぜ？？おまけにこんな子のパンティーをゲッツできるんだぜ？？しょうもねーゲームだな、おい、どんだけけしからんゲームなんだおいはやく２出して下さい。\n\n\n結果：\n\n十点満点中、「もうとっくにご存知なんだろう？俺は二ポーンのヘンタイワールドから来たヘンタイスト・・・穏やかなニートでありながら激しいエロスによって目覚めた伝説の超戦士・・・・スーパーヘンタイストだーーーーー！！！！！！」\n\n\n・・・・って俺なんちゅうレビュー書いてんねん","March 14, 2015","true","12.3"," 494 of 540 people (91%) found this review helpful 323 people found this review funny","91","494","540","323","0"

A girl could have a DD cup size, be 5'6" and weigh 118 lbs.\n- The girls all seem concerned about their weights, many of them claiming to be dieting or trying to lose the weight despite enjoying junk food/candy/desserts\n- The information you learn about the girls is pretty superficial: "What's your favorite color?", "How tall are you?" and then they expect you to memorize that and you get more points for that... Pretty silly\n- No "date" dialogue; the dates only consist of you playing the Candy Crush game well enough to get to the point threshold. Sometimes they ooo or ahh in response.\n- No jealousy dialogue\n- You literally have no other activities except hitting on these girls and where you go is determined by which girl you want to see\n\nDespite having more wordy cons than pros for this game, I still recommend it because it was different than most visual novel games I've played. It appeals to the common denominator of interactive soft-core hentai lovers, but if you're looking for an involved story with good dialogue, I would say look elsewhere. There is no emotional journey, no growing, you're literally just trying to get with as many different girls as you can. It really bugs me that the protagonist has no identity as well, as I loved that you could play a girl (and the dialogue changes accordingly). The information you learn about the other girls is comprised of nebulous details too, just awful and boring when some of them have children they don't talk to. I'd rather memorize things that matter, like their child's names, or why they hate university, or how they got to be the person they are. Not to mention, some of them just insult you when you ask the stupid questions you have to ask them anyway.\n\nThis game doesn't try to be anything more than what it advertises, though. Even when they advertise you get plenty of "plot", the "plot" must be in quotations because it's more of an illusion that there's a plot. You want sexy pictures? You will get them. You want dialogue choices? You will get them. You want girls moaning as you match icons together? It's there. It's simple and if you're into light-hearted playa sexy time, you'll get it. It's just disappointing for the people who actually play for the story and relationships. I haven't managed to sleep with all of them (I can only play Candy Crush for so long), so if there's an ending where you do see an emotional journey, I apologize as I haven't gotten there yet.\n\nTLDR: Boobs.\n\nEDIT **SPOILER ALERT**: I have finally slept with all the girls. There is no ending or closure that I can see, except for getting the rest of the outfits and hairstyles. Honestly, I would only recommend you sleep with everyone just to get the rest of the CGs, but my claim on lack of story still stands.","January 20, 2015","true","16.9"," 266 of 300 people (89%) found this review helpful 60 people found this review funny","89","266","300","60","11"

I streamed this game straight on twitch for over 12 hours. Got suspended at the 12th hour cause I didn't know that even Steam's censored version still had a lot of porn in it.\n\nThe game itself is well made with good music (except for the carnival BGM) and very high production values all throughout. The clincher is the writing: its excellent; and the full english voice acting is superb. The developer shows self-awareness by giving us realistic-sounding women that swear, drink, and talk about sex and your obvious interest in their lady parts openly.\n\nIf you're looking for your by-the-numbers visual novel with chicks falling into your lap and gameplay comprising of reading / clicking furiously through textboxes and occassionally choosing the right (obvious) answer to please the girl, then this game is not for you.\n\nIf, however, you're up for a challenge and appreciate the occassional naked girl bits, then HuniePop is amazing. This is the Puzzle Quest of anime porn games.\n\nP.S.: This game lends itself to a portable release really well. They should make a PS Vita / Android version.","January 21, 2015","true","38.5"," 160 of 180 people (89%) found this review helpful 27 people found this review funny","89","160","180","27","0"

Unlike the usual dating sims, however, the date spot is chosen randomly, and your success at the date is determined by winning a match-3 puzzle game. Also unlike the usual dating sims, you don’t focus on winning one of the girls, but instead can (and in fact expected to) date all the girls at once, without any negative repercussions.\n\nThe puzzle aspect of the game is top-notch. Among other things, you are required to focus on specific pieces depending on which girl you are dating, and there is a huge selection of power-ups (represented by date gifts), and choosing the ones that work well together is very important for late-game puzzles.\n\nDating sim aspect, however, is kind of lacking. The girls have very distinct personalities and some backstory, but next to none present-time development is happening: as you date the girls you are rewarded with photos and new outfits for them, but your relationship isn’t going anywhere. Meeting new girls and learning more about them is still fun, though.\n\nFinal thing worth mentioning: HuniePop was originally an adult game, and while Steam version is censored, I believe it is still NSFW, which may be off-putting for some people. Those who enjoy adult content, though, will be pleased that it is possible to un-censor Steam version of the game (information about that can be found at Steam forum).\n\nI fully recommend this game to everyone who like match-3 puzzles and isn’t put off by adult content. And while HuniePop isn’t 100% typical dating sim, I believe that dating sim fans will thoroughly enjoy it as well.","January 31, 2015","true","74.0"," 101 of 106 people (95%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","95","101","106","5","0"

Yes sex sells. It sold me. But this game is more than dating sim, it‘s a really hard puzzle game. Of course the main goal is sex.\n\nThe magic sex fairy appears and you start your journey to conquering the girls with only a pack of tissues and a porn magazine in your pocket. You start going on dates with different girls and make your best to seduce them by telling them how you masturbate and so on. Your goal is to have sex with all of them. Well, not at the same time of course. Though it would be nice i guess, a super hardcore mode?\nEvery girl has a different personality and taste. You can talk to them and you must remember their birthdays, favorite time of year, their breast size, hobbies and many more. Also you can give various gifts to them. Like yoga bag, sombrero, happy pills, watering can, vibrator and so on. If you want to have better chances to succeed on a date, you must feed them and most importantly – make them drunk by giving them lots of alcohol.\n\nAfter you ask girl on a date, the color matching puzzle game begins. You must connect 3 or more blocks of the same color to get points. There‘s always one color which gives more points and another one gives less points, depending on the girls personality. Each personality corresponds to a different color. In addition to getting the girls drunk you take a few gifts with you, which could increase the count of some blocks, depending on the gift. One date is not enough to get into girls panties. You‘ll need 5 successful dates for this, and believe me it‘s difficult. One wrong move and you can forget about seeing those ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ tonight. Same as in real life. There are broken heart blocks and if you connect them the score goes down so far that it‘s practically impossible to succeed at the date after that. And to succeed at this game is almost same as hard as in real life. After each successful date the girls send you a sexy picture. With time the pictures become more and more revealing and you know you‘re getting closer to your goal. And when you finally get into bed with a girl it simulates the sex very accurately, you'll see when you get there.\n\nHonestly i don‘t know how this game got on steam, but steam needs more sex themed games. Valve could make an adult section where maybe only people with credit card information would be allowed or something like that.\nI can recommend this game to people who want something funny and completely wrong. Don‘t take it seriously (same goes for my review, don‘t get offended by it, i‘m just trying to match the mood of the game in my review), the game is about having fun. I know some people hate games like this, but to each their own. I love variety, i play very different games and i‘m not judging anyone if they play games i don‘t like. The game is aimed to male audience of course, i doubt women would find this game interesting. But it would be interesting to see similar game for female audience.\n\n\nPros:\n\nSex\nBoobs\nFunny dialogues\n\nCons:\n\nNo DLC","March 1","true","6.9"," 95 of 102 people (93%) found this review helpful 37 people found this review funny","93","95","102","37","13"

The puzzle mechanics are basically a slightly easier version of candy crush with each puzzle piece playing a distinct role for the "date." The girls themselves are very varied in personality and in looks and each requires different techniques to "succeed" with them (if you know what i mean ;)) The characters are really well voice acted (compared to other dating sims) and there is a lot of art used in the game.\n\nThe only negative thing i can really say about the game is with the main character (you) are slowely and methodically being transformed into a player by a love fairy (who you eventually date as well). But that is does not at all ruin the fun of the game and I highly recommend.\n\n10/10 would date again :D\n\nAlso, here is the exteded video discussion of the game:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPZkOZVjWgw","January 19, 2015","true","32.0"," 140 of 173 people (81%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","81","140","173","17","3"

Do you long for the joy of human interaction, to know the touch of another person? Of course you don't. You're a wibblyboo. You are proud, strong, and foreveralone.\n\nAnd HuniePop is here for you.\n\nJust about every waifu stereotype is lined up here for your perusal. There are some fun interactions but very little 'sim' gameplay. The HunieBee makes it borderline impossible to screw up, informing you of everything from names all the way to the sorts of gifts that will get you into dem shorts the fastest.\n\nNOT SO FAST, says HuniePop. You may have gotten her all steamed up and good to go with your timely offering of a spatula that you just happened to have on your person, but a woman is not some easily-bought ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ you can just pick up like that. The real way to a girl's heart lies through the mystic ritual of match-3 voodoo. For some reason.\n\nThis is at least fun and you already know how it works. Match the colors, make smart usage of the special power tokens to give the girls the vapors, and then spray your load of +numbers and beepboop sounds all over their nubile young bodies, leaving them reeling, blushy, and eager to slob on your pixel knob.\n\nMasterfully display your command of tile-matching and you will eventually get them to take their clothes off and give it up for your alpha male stylings. Censored, of course! We can't have the sight of an exposed ♥♥♥♥♥♥ distracting us from our murder simulations. If this riles you up like the red-blooded porn aficionado you are, it is fortunately very easy to decensor the game (check the forums to see the stickied post from the devs with simple instructions.)\n\nBut srsly. The game knows what it is and it knows what the target audience wants. Luckily, it has managed to make this pandering a surprisingly fun romp for just about anyone who enjoys puzzle stuff and bare-bones social sims. Some of the characters even end up likable whether you want to bone them or not, aided by some pretty decent voice acting.\n\nIs gud? Is gud. u buy nao.

(Pretty sure I have the uncensored version too, unless Steam got lenient over the years.)\n\nTo be honest, this game's more of a Puzzle/RPG with girls since you can level stats and what-not but to call it a dating system is a stretch.

That all changes the day that you get visited by the sexy, scantily clad dating fairy who vows to teach you how to play the field and promises that with her help you’ll go on dates and get laid. From there the “Yukki”-esque fairy teaches you the core gameplay mechanics which aren’t that too different from other puzzle games in the vein of Bejeweled. You go on dates that consist of the puzzles where you connect three or more of the various colored balls and earn “Affection” points, and you can earn bonus “Affection” points by paying attention to the girls personality and focusing heavily on the color balls that she desires most. You are tasked with reaching a set level of Affection points to pass the level and have a successful date, however with every successful date you have, the level of Affection points required for the next date becomes significantly higher which certainly adds to the difficulty considering you are limited to 20 moves per date. In addition to the colored ball tokens, there are also bell tokens which give you an extra turn, heart tokens which increase your passion level that increases the affection points you get when you connect the colored balls, sentiment tear drops that allow you to use various items, and purple broken heart tokens that sap affection points from your date and can be truly devastating to a date. At the conclusion of each date both successful and failure dates, you are awarded “Munies” that you can use to spend on food, drinks, and gifts for your dates.\n\nAs you talk to the girls and successfully choose the right dialog branch you are awarded “Hunie” which is used to upgrade your traits that give you bonuses and allow you to perform better in the puzzle dates. It’s sad, because one of the games both strongest and weakest points are the dialog, for both the cut scenes and dialog trees. The dialog is really what makes this game worth playing…It will make you laugh, cringe, and blush, however it becomes repetitive very quickly, and spending time with any one girl for too long will cause the dialog to loop back around and start recycling itself.\n\nWith each successfully date; you earn a “heart” in the girls love progression bar. Once you reach either 4 or 5 hearts depending on how into you the girl is, if you successfully pass a date puzzle at night then things will get disappointingly hot and heavy. You’ll finally get laid and the sex mini-game puzzle is just merely a puzzle similar to the ones you’re used to only with no limit on your number of turns, you have to rapidly connect the colored ball tokens to combat the decreasing Affection points bar  all the while your date is moaning and egging you on. Upon completion of the mini-game you are awarded a semi-nude sexual photo of your date that gets added to your photo album. The fact that that’s as far as the game is willing to push the envelope is a little disappointing, If you are going to make a game that focuses on this type of subject matter and the entire goal of the game is to have sex…then there should have been more of a payoff than there was.\n\nBesides the puzzles and dialog, the game also features a very large amount of “Plot”. The Plot is very well animated and the various image stills you receive in the game are all very well illustrated. The only issues some may run into with the “plot” is that the steam version is censored, but this can be easily remedied if you so desired with a patch released by the devs.\n\nThe game successfully delivers a fairly solid puzzle dating sim that is delivered with the look and feel of a visual novel. The game is held back however by its sub-par voice acting, repetitive dialog, and less than climactic climax scenes.\n\n\nhttp://noobsthatplaygames.com/","January 24, 2015","true","2.9"," 127 of 161 people (79%) found this review helpful 24 people found this review funny","79","127","161","24","1"

You make matches with limited moves to earn enough points to win a date.\nAll the tokens on the grid represent a chararistic people have, such as talent or romance, and each of the ladies prefer something unique.\nTiffany, for example, prefers you match the green flirtation tokens and doesn't care too much for matching the red sexuality tokens, so you're enticed to focus on making better matches with the flirtation tokens to earn more points, while matching sexuality tokens won't earn you as many.\n\nThe sex minigame is like the date one, but there's no limit on moves, and your points constantly drop.\nEarn enough points to reach the limit, and... You and your date reach the limit, I guess.\nAlso, the girl will moan and make general sex noises when you make matches, so, wear headphones.\n\nI think now's a time to mention that art is awesome. Each girl looks cute, and you can dress them up in different clothing.\nI just think Lola doesn't need to wear her stewardess uniform all the time, alright?\n\nThe music is hit or miss. Most of the date themes are really fun, as well as some non-date themes, but other themes are just plain generic and dumb.\n\nThe game is fully voiced, and the writing is really funny, even if it's incredibly stupid at times.\nEach character is interesting, and while they're just there to have sex with, they all have fun personalities, and unique traits.\nKyanna is a single mother who constantly works out to stay in shape, Aiko hates her job as a schoolteacher but is a sexual deviant, Nikki is a huge introvert who'd rather stay in her room than attend clubs, and Audrey is a ***** who does drugs.\n\nThe gifts you can give these ladies are kind of dumb, and racist at that.\nKyanna is latina, so her gifts are Mexican-themed like (I kid you not) maracas and luchador masks, while Aiko is Japanese, so you can give her chopsticks and kimonos.\nHowever, Aiko DOES call you a racist for giving her these gifts, so I assume the game is in on the joke of being a parody of dating sims.\nAlso, your love fairy companion "loves her some chocolate" and has "yellow feaver." No comment.\n\nI think I "beat" the game, having sex with all the girls, even the secret ones, but there's no ending.\nThe devs promised an update for post-game content around Valentine's Day, so I'll keep my eyes on that.\n\nBut, for now, I can only recommend this if you like fanservice and puzzle games.\nAnd anime girls moaning in your headphones while you play Bejeweled on crack.\n\nEDIT: Welp, my Valentine's Day plans were canceled, so I go this game to fap my sorrow away, and finally see the update!\nNow, there's an ending to the game, achievements, a few bonuses and tweaks, and an even harder difficulty.\nI still recommend the game, but again, it isn't for everyone.","February 7, 2015","true","15.0"," 68 of 76 people (89%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","89","68","76","18","1"

You play the game on a day to day basis as a hopeless dude (or lady!) looking to date one of many women in the game. It is a quirky game with the art style of a Japanese visual novel and the writing of one of the many flash based, dude-bro western dating sims.\n\nGraphics:\n\n2D- Japanese Visual Novel styled art\n\n+Surprisingly decent production value for this style of game.\n+Surprisingly accurate lip sync for all characters.\n\n-Art style is inconsistent between character stills and collectible CG. (Honestly of the three characters I have completed so far, none of them really looked entirely the same as the in game stills. The art isn't bad, but it can be a bit jarring.)\n\nMixed- The character art. The art style itself will be highly subjective but many of the characters felt generic when it came to character design. This will be a matter of opinion however and you can easily check the characters before you buy.\n\nSound:\n\n+Surprisngly good soundtrack. My personal favorite is the Spanish guitar tune that plays during certain romantic dates.\n\nMixed- Voice acting. I found the voices hit and miss. Some of the characters sound VERY similar due to sharing voice actresses and can be extremely noticable at times. My personal favorite is the main hostess Kyu.\n\nWriting:\n\nThe actual writing in the game takes some getting used to. It uses, in the developers own words, a highly abrasive western style of writing. So expect some "ladybro" speak, club girls, and the like. I personally found it very entertaining but it might be a shock to those who are not used to this western style talk coming from Japanese style character art.\n\n+ You are bound to find someone you like in this large cast.\n+ The writing maintains a consistent quality. If you like the story, you will be pleased to know it maintains it style and quality throughout the whole game.\n\n- There are very few "events" in the game. Girls have an introduction scene, and an ending scene. Otherwise all character dialogue comes in the form of question and answer. You will ask them questions, and sometimes they will quiz you on what you asked. You can see some character development through this but it feels like reading a Flash card and it repeats often.\n\nGameplay:\n\nThe puzzle aspect of this game is a simplified bejeweled. It starts of easy and then with every victory it increases in difficulty. That is to say ANY victory will make EVERY puzzle hard. So if you complete one girl and then start another, her introduction date will be much harder than the previous girls.\n\nIn between puzzles you will go around talking to each girl. Talking earns experience, which is called Hunie in this game, which is used to increase traits that make certain block more valuable. A useful thing to improve as each girl has a preferred color of block to match. If you are succesful in impressing a girl you can earn dating gifts that do cool things like turning all the bad blocks into good block, or cashing in on multipliers to help complete the date.\n\nGirls have a stamina bar that keeps you from talking to her too long. You can increase the stamina using food which is bought with cash, called Monie in this game. Monie is earned by dates. You will get monie even if you fail, so it is still worthwhile trying a date no mattter the difficulty.\n\nConclusion:\n\nOverall I find this to be a fairly fun puzzle game that is light on content. If you like Bejeweled, cute girls, and abrasive humor I would say the game is worth the asking price. I do hope that in any sequel they will expand on, well, everything. It is a very simple game but with some fleshing out I feel it could find a good niche between the puzzlers and the dating sims.","January 23, 2015","true","13.0"," 69 of 87 people (79%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","79","69","87","4","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Hotdogbitchface/recommended/339800/","Hotdogbitchface","Hotdog Bitchface","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Hotdogbitchface/","2391 products in account","Welp. It certainly brings new meaning to the term “single player” I suppose.\n\nI should begin by saying that I’m not terribly experienced with dating simulators. Outside of Hatoful Boyfriend which I absolutely loathed, the last dating sim I played was some flash-based game on Newgrounds called Ganguro Girl back in 2002 - a guilty (…) pleasure back in my younger days. Due to the sour taste that Hatoful Boyfriend left in my mouth, I lost interest in the abundance of dating sims now plaguing Steam. It took a special video to pique my interest:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcGPYxpPt6Q)\n\nAnd so I played it. I played it for 10.5 hours, apparently. Somehow, I even got my non-gaming girlfriend hellaciously addicted to it.\n\nStory\nHuniepop begins with a dream sequence, in which you meet a very perky and attractive female. After some pathetic attempts at flirting, you wake up in your bedroom and find a “love fairy” in your room, who spends the rest of the game helping you pick up girls that are so stereotyped that it puts Mean Girls to shame. Such stereotypes include ♥♥♥♥♥y teacher, ♥♥♥♥♥y milf, ♥♥♥♥♥y high schooler, weird spiritualist, geeky girl, mega ♥♥♥♥♥ and a young single mum, among others. Your goal is to sleep with each and every one of them.\n\nGameplay\nThe developers described the game perfectly. For those too lazy to read the top right of their screen right now, the basic gist of it is that it’s half dating sim, half match-three puzzle game with an awful lot of “plot”.\n\nThe dating sim portion of the game involves you talking to each of the girls, asking them questions and every so often, answering their questions, which may include them quizzing you on questions that they’ve asked you. Talking to girls and answering their questions correctly earns you points, which can be used to purchase upgrades to your stats (charisma, sexuality, etc), which will make the other main portion of the game (the puzzle portion) easier. You can also earn these points by buying gifts for your target waifu.\n\nAfter you’re done talking, you can choose to take a girl on a date. The dating portion of the game plays as a very simple match-three puzzle game. Each gem on the screen has a different purpose, and your goal is to match three or more of these gems to earn enough “affection” to successfully complete the date. Just like the real world, certain girls seem to favour some attributes more so than others – matching three “sexuality” gems may work wonders for the cougar lady, but won’t quite do against the shy little geeky one. Other gems don’t contribute directly to the affection count, but assist you in earning more affection. The passion (pink hearts) gem, for example, provides passion which will increase the amount of affection that other gems provide, whilst the sentiment gems (light blue) allow you to use certain gifts in the middle of the puzzle which provide extra bonuses. Each puzzle has a limited number of moves that you’re allowed to make. Running out of moves before reaching the target “affection” level (which increases with subsequent dates) will result in you failing the date. Successfully completing the date will reward you with a decent sum of money and more importantly, greater admiration from your future waifu. Once you successfully date a girl 3 times, the game allows you take a girl out at night, which results in… Yeah.\n\nUnfortunately, the game never really gets deeper than that. Yes, you can buy food, drinks and gifts for the girls, but there’s no challenge to this as each girl’s favourite foods and gifts are not only listed in their profile but also indicated with a star or heart next to the item in the store. The getting-to-know-you portion of the game never really offers anything challenging or original compared to any other dating sim ever. On the other hand, the simple-yet-addictive puzzle portions of the game do provide some value in breaking up the monotony of scrolling through lines of cringeworthy-but-hilarious dialogue.\n\nThe “plot”\nI imagine anyone reading this review will understand that there’s a huge different between a “story” and a “plot”.\nHonestly, I was actually surprised at just how graphic some of the depictions of the girls were. I’m not even sure if I’m allowed to talk about it here. If Steam reviews censor swearing, then they’re probably not going to be happy with me talking about pictures of naked anime girls bent over and dripping ♥♥♥♥♥ from their nether regions. In a weird sense, I think I’m legitimately too old for this stuff now. I’m sure an 18-year-old virgin might feel differently though.\n\nThen there’s the other major thing that differentiates this title from Hatoful Boyfriend – The absolutely hilarious voiceovers. Seriously, the dialogue in this game is golden and the voiceovers are spot on. I really wouldn’t want it any other way.\n\nOverall impression\nHonestly, I enjoyed this game because of just how incredibly hilarious and inappropriate it was. The puzzle sections of the game were a fairly welcome addition to the genre and helped to keep the game more engaging and challenging than its contemporaries. A word of warning though – you will be judged by your Steam friends for playing this game. Whether you choose to proceed despite that is up to you.","January 25, 2015","true","10.5"," 46 of 53 people (87%) found this review helpful 23 people found this review funny","87","46","53","23","4"

Going into the game all\nI knew was it was a dating sim with puzzle game elements…. what the real selling point was for me was when I saw all the incredibly ridiculous steam reviews:\n\n“Well, I didn't expect her to ♥♥♥♥ on the first date let alone squirt. And when Tiffany refuses anything other than Anal, I almost choked one out right there and then”\n\nThat was when I knew I had to see what the heck this game was about.\n\nThe game focuses on you playing as a guy who is an absolutely hopeless virgin who is utterly horrible in the dating scene. That all changes the day that you get visited by the sexy, scantily clad dating fairy who vows to teach you how to play the field and promises that with her help you’ll go on dates and get laid. From there the “Yukki”-esque fairy teaches you the core gameplay mechanics which aren’t that too different from other puzzle games in the vein of Bejeweled. You go on dates that consist of the puzzles where you connect three or more of the various colored balls and earn “Affection” points, and you can earn bonus “Affection” points by paying attention to the girls personality and focusing heavily on the color balls that she desires most. You are tasked with reaching a set level of Affection points to pass the level and have a successful date, however with every successful date you have, the level of Affection points required for the next date becomes significantly higher which certainly adds to the difficulty considering you are limited to 20 moves per date. In addition to the colored ball tokens, there are also bell tokens which give you an extra turn, heart tokens which increase your passion level that increases the affection points you get when you connect the colored balls, sentiment tear drops that allow you to use various items, and purple broken heart tokens that sap affection points from your date and can be truly devastating to a date. At the conclusion of each date both successful and failure dates, you are awarded “Munies” that you can use to spend on food, drinks, and gifts for your dates.\n\nAs you talk to the girls and successfully choose the right dialog branch you are awarded “Hunie” which is used to upgrade your traits that give you bonuses and allow you to perform better in the puzzle dates. It’s sad, because one of the games both strongest and weakest points are the dialog, for both the cut scenes and dialog trees. The dialog is really what makes this game worth playing…It will make you laugh, cringe, and blush, however it becomes repetitive very quickly, and spending time with any one girl for too long will cause the dialog to loop back around and start recycling itself.\n\nWith each successfully date; you earn a “heart” in the girls love progression bar. Once you reach either 4 or 5 hearts depending on how into you the girl is, if you successfully pass a date puzzle at night then things will get disappointingly hot and heavy. You’ll finally get laid and the sex mini-game puzzle is just merely a puzzle similar to the ones you’re used to only with no limit on your number of turns, you have to rapidly connect the colored ball tokens to combat the decreasing Affection points bar all the while your date is moaning and egging you on. Upon completion of the mini-game you are awarded a semi-nude sexual photo of your date that gets added to your photo album. The fact that that’s as far as the game is willing to push the envelope is a little disappointing, If you are going to make a game that focuses on this type of subject matter and the entire goal of the game is to have sex…then there should have been more of a payoff than there was.\n\nBesides the puzzles and dialog, the game also features a very large amount of “Plot”. The Plot is very well animated and the various image stills you receive in the game are all very well illustrated. The only issues some may run into with the “plot” is that the steam version is censored, but this can be easily remedied if you so desired with a patch released by the devs.\n\nThe game successfully delivers a fairly solid puzzle dating sim that is delivered with the look and feel of a visual novel. The game is held back however by its sub-par voice acting, repetitive dialog, and less than climactic climax scenes.\n\n\nhttp://noobsthatplaygames.com/","February 4, 2015","true","1.1"," 48 of 57 people (84%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","84","48","57","13","0"

I mean, you can't take it seriously; all the girls are basically caricatures and the conversations never rise above ludicrous but the mechanics are entertaining, there's some laughs to be had and the puzzles ramp up to be challenging (mind you, I never play puzzle games so maybe the Candy Crush masters will find this easy).  You meet girls, ask them questions, get asked questions and go on "dates" represented via the match-3 bubble puzzles where the personality of the girl affects the value of each bubble type (so one may value "Flirting" matches more and another "Talent" matches).  Your conversations are tempered by a constant need to buy food and gifts to keep her talking and the dates oddly give you the money you'll need to start all over again.  Eventually your night time dates can lead to bedtime frolicking represented by a "lightning round" style puzzle.\n\nThe game is unabashedly what is is and if you think you might be offended, you certainly will be so save your money.  If the trailer makes you laugh at either the dialogue or voice acting, you'll probably enjoy yourself for at least a while.  I don't know if the game will have a ton of staying power from a gaming standpoint (unless you want to collect a bunch of semi-naked pictures) but it's fun while it lasts.\n\nOf special note is the musical score which is very catchy and well done.  It's rare that I notice game music enough to realize it and I found myself enjoying it multiple times throughout my playing.","January 19, 2015","true","27.5"," 44 of 51 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","44","51","0","0"

account","Well lets start by saying that this is "THE GAME",and when i say "THE GAME" i mean "THE GAME" that's causing an extreme amount of controversy on STEAM as even if you play the censored version you will still end up (eventually) seeing some rather rude image's of the girl's you will date,but if you download the patch "BOY-OH-BOY" the image's you see then are thing's that wouldent be out of place on some dodgy website,how do i know............................well i just do OK,so stop asking me question's about it *GULP* ;)\n\nHuniePop Release Trailer -\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrr4xVU06VE\n\nOk i hear you cry it has BUM'S and BOOB'S in it but what does it actually play like and is the game actually any good????????????\nWell lets deal with the most important thing first and that's the gameplay,now when you start the game you wake up and come face to face with Kyu who is a magic love fairy hailing from the mythical Sky Garden,ok so not your usual morning wake up call,me i set my alarm clock.\nShe then proceed's to tell you that she has come to help you try to get dates as you are pathetic at it (well that really made me feel good about myself) and you need her help,this lead's to you walking round the various location's the game has to offer and meeting your prospective date's.\nSo after meeting the nine girl's we then get down to the brass tac's of the gameplay and you learn that to unlock new outfit's for the girl's you need to buy them gifts,but not just any gifts ones they will actually like.Now this is where your Hunie pop device come's in handy as when you activate it,it gives bios for all the girl's and also access to your inventory,the shop to buy gifts,your traits and the ability to upgrade them and more beside's.\nAnd believe me you need to upgrade your trait's to get anywhere in this game as when you go on a date you then get to the main part of the game where you have to MATCH 3 symbol's that are the same and score enough points and you win the date.Sounds easy yes,WRONG as each girl like's and will be happier with certain symbol's matched together in three's than other's and all girl's like different combinations,so you will have to learn what symbol's and then remember if you dont well you fail your date if you do then eventually you'll end up with another notch in your bedhead.Then you move onto your next date and start talking to the girl and then "RING-RING" you get a new message and also a photograph for that successful  date,OK that even happen's in real life but (and i do mean BUT) as you win more date's you get more revealing photo's from the girl's until you actually get to bed them,BED THEM yes BED THEM!!!!!!!!!!!!!\nSo after four successful  date's (IT ISNT THIS EASY IN REAL LIFE) you get to...................well like i said bed the girl and in doing so what do you get for your trouble's and hard work,a pair of underwear..............likes its some sort of trophy.\nNow when you have successfully dated all girl's you may think that's it,well no actually as there are three secret girl's to date and so on you go onto more conquest's.One girl is easy to get and she just appear's when you have won the other nine date's (OH ten actually,Kyu the love fairy as well) but the other two take a bit of guess work (OR LOOKING IT UP ON GOOGLE WORKS AS WELL).\n\nHeres a shot i got sent by one of the girl's for a successful  date (CLEAN SHOT THOUGH-SOME ARE WELL................DEARY ME) -\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=385025900\n\nAnd that's the problem this game will have appealing to a main stream audience,the fact that the image's you see in game and the negative way it treat's its female cast (even though to be honest its all done in jest "You can keep my underwear its ok HONEY") are getting so much attention that people think that's all the game has to offer.\nWell i can tell you that even though it does have image's like that,that the game itself is actually both well made and oft time's hillarious,"Hillarious you say" and i say yes it is as some of the thing's the girl's will say will make you cringe but more often than not you will end up laughing out loud at the script and what the girls actually say to each other.And all dialogue in game is actually fully spoken by an all female voice cast,which adds to the fun factor when they start fighting or ♥♥♥♥♥ing each other off.\nI can understand why the game is getting the stick it is but if you like a solid puzzle game with MATCH 3 element's then you cant go wrong with this game.Like i said the gameplay element's are solid and if you havent leveled up your trait's and you dont know what the girl your dating like's in her symbol's that you match then sorry son but your going to fail that date.\n\nHeres a short video that show's and explain's how the gameplay play's out during a date -\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TWrTCiuEDk\n\nSo in closing as allways will you want to play this game and will you get anything out of it,answer the following three questions and see what you think -\n\n1 - Do you want a great MATCH 3 game that has a sense of humour and a great script that will at point's have you laughing out loud???\n\n2 - Are you ok with (EVEN IN THE CENSORED VERSION) seeing the girl's in less than,shall we say flattering poses???\n\n3 - Do you like anime style art in your game's,as your going to be seeing a lot of it before this game reache's its conclusion???\n\nIf you answered yes to the above question's then what are you waiting for buy it now,if not and you arent into MATCH 3 type game's or you dont want to see the sort of image's this game puts forward then that's ok,the game isnt for everyone.\nBut even though the game does contain image's that some may find offensive the game itself would actually stand on its own due to the strong MATCH 3 game play element's and the often hillarious script.\n\n(I DO NOT OWN ANY OF THE CLIPS OF VIDEOS PUT UP IN THIS REVIEW AND THEY BELONG TO THEIR RESPECTIVE OWNERS AND ARE THEIRS BY

HuniePop is an amazing puzzle adventure that I have become addicted to. I find myself wanting to play more after I wake up. This game has ruined my sleeping schedule, actually... and that's because of how much I really enjoy it.\n\nOf course there will be reviews out there that enjoy the game strictly for aesthetics, but I look past that. If that's what you're into, though, that's fine. But, strictly rating HuniePop on gameplay: it's fantastic. I have 23 hours clocked into the game, 96% completion rate, and I cannot wait to complete my first file. I plan on starting a new file after I have reached 100% on my first file just to get all of the achievements I've missed while on my first playthrough.\n\nAs someone who thoroughly enjoys puzzle games, HuniePop never disappointed me. I love Alpha Mode and its ever-increasingly difficulty. I'm the type of person who loves a challenge. Though HuniePop does get quite challenging with the introduction of Alpha Mode, I still find it to be a relaxing game. I feel like it improves my terrible short-term memory, since the girls will quiz you about themselves and other girls later on in the game. I think that the fact that HuniePop seems to help improve my short-term memory is definitely a bit of a bonus.\n\nOutside of the game being relaxing, challenging, and helpful for memory, it has a great soundtrack. The music tends to be very lighthearted and bubbly. The personalities of the girls made it easy for me to laugh. This game is great for those who want to stay in a great mood.\n\nI would like to commend HuniePot on creating such a wonderful game. I am looking forward to HunieCam Studio - and although it is going to be quite different, I hope has as much work put into it (if not more) than HuniePop, because this game is an absolute steal for its price on steam.\n\nTo close out this review, I would like to say thanks for providing an addicting, adult game with memorable characters. I understand that the game may not be suitable for a younger audience, but would recommend it to anyone who is able to pick up the game...to get it. No hesitation there, just get the game.  I am also happy that it has over 20 hours of gameplay in it (for completitonists).\n\nI hope that this review might help someone out there, and I hope that readers end up enjoying the game as much as I am enjoying it right now.","August 26, 2015","true","35.8"," 34 of 36 people (94%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","94","34","36","8","0"

But I was surprised it didn't turn out like that.\n\nHuniePop certainly isn't a perfect game. It's a really good game with some unpolished spots all around it. HuniePop features a dating like mode where you can talk to the girls, earn Hunie (which can be used for upgrades) and give them gifts. Then there is the "actual gameplay" part, shich are the dates. The dates are played through Bejeweled-like puzzles which get harder and harder each time you succesfully complete one date. After each date you unlock a special "reward"...\n\nFor me, the selling point was the cheery idea behind the game, fun dialogue and good graphics but I just personally feel like the developers count on the "rewards" side a little bit too much... What are the rewards you may ask? They are straight up hentai/ecchi pictures which are then stored to your storage where you can admire all the pictures whenever you want. I'm not saying the pictures didn't affect me. They certainly added some kind of reason to keep playing the game and wanting to see what you unlock next.\n\nOverall, HuniePop is a very fun and addicting game and has all your needs covered wether it be a quick wank or a quick Bejeweled round. Worth picking up from sale but I wouldn't recommend this game on full price. The game repeats a lot after a while but surprisingly doesn't get boring. The puzzle mode is just that good.","January 1","true","13.3"," 37 of 41 people (90%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","90","37","41","15","4"

I might have been misguided in this, but I was expecting something a bit more... like a Visual Novel or Dating Sim, where talking to the girls would branch out more or allow for different events to happen.\nI would love to get to talk more with Jessie about her work, her situation with her daughter, maybe help her mend that relationship.\nI'd also love to get to actually look at Aiko's web browser history, or get it down and dirty under her desk.\nAnd what about taking part in a yoga class with Beli, or go on a space trip with Celeste?\n\nThe girls are interesting, but apart from filling a fact sheet and getting some glimpse about their personality and life, the whole talk part of the game feels somewhat shallow and something that could be improved greatly, hopefully in a sequel.\n\nThe match 3 part of the game is fun and somewhat addicting. I'm not a great match 3 player, mostly because it's not the kind of game I usually play, but the gifts part lends itself to some interesting choices to strategically take on the puzzles.\n\nThe art for the girls ended being better than I was expecting, especially for the naugthy event images. I wish there were more of those event images though, both nsfw and sfw since they do work in framing the background the girls a bit more.\n\nAll in all, even with some reservations about those parts that I think could have been done better/made them have a bit more depth, I believe this is a fun and nice enough game, definitely worth the asking price, especially with the release discount.","January 23, 2015","true","15.6"," 37 of 42 people (88%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","88","37","42","3","0"

(Beware future game devs http://www.huniepop.com/post/108464572403/sjw-reviews-hp-spoiler-he-doesnt-like-it so you know where you don't send your game review copies to)\n\n1) download a patch from the devs here http://steamcommunity.com/app/339800/discussions/0/616198900649668367/\n\n2) Buy the game from their website or MangaGamer https://www.mangagamer.com/detail.php?goods_type=1&product_code=130\n\nhttp://www.huniepop.com/\n\nNow since that's out of the way I'll try my best to explain what works, what could've been added & what I don't like in the game. (I'm also going to mention some minor spoilers so watch out & also another warning the girls in the game are all stereotypes so that's another reason the easily offended should stay away from the game)\n\nThe whole point of this game is to get laid (obviously) either picking a male or female gender to score with 12 different kinds of girls (4 of them are secrets) who all have different personalities, interests, hobbies, boob sizes & so on but just so you know you're very anti-social according to the game so you need the help of a 10,000 year old fairy named Kyu (One of the girls you date in the game, very perverted & no not the letter Q) to teach you what techniques work on each girl (Forgot to mention mildly racist/perverted towards Aiko since she's an asian.... another girl that's datable in the game).\n\nJust to get the pros out of the way I liked the cheesy/funny writing, the music, the creative use of unlimited match 3 with sex moans involved when your date loves you enough to bang the hell out of her, the ladies that did the voiceovers for each girl except for Audrey I couldn't stand her, 2 of the secret girls give you questions about the universe & cats, the use of emotions for the match 3 puzzles like for example an orange coloured crescent moon is romance (Bejeweled & Candy Crush have new competition this year), the gallery of NSFW pictures you unlock after a successful date with each girl (You can only get 4 pics from each girl) & you can get money just for dating in the game but you have to spend it all on luxuries for the women.\n\nThe only cons I have to say about this game is the repetitiveness in the dialogue when the girls ask you questions about remembering information about them, Certain questions from Venus for example get annoying after a while, the options menu & there is no end cutscene to this game after you date all the girls. What the devs should've added is a better punishment for the failed dates you encounter instead of only getting half the cash so that's the only option I can think of that I feel the game should've had to make the game more intense so overall if Valentine's Day does come just play videogames like HuniePop to waste time on.\n\nIf I missed anything, or you want to correct me on anything, feel free to leave feedback, it helps me a lot.\n\nUPDATE: The devs just keep on giving more new content & it addresses such concerns like an ending scene for example http://steamcommunity.com/app/339800/discussions/0/611698195148212248/\n\nEDIT: Alpha mode is really hard so you need a lot of patience to handle each date properly\n\nUPDATE 2: The devs have decided to add a politically correct mode (Coming Soon) to make fun of radical feminists & oversensitive people in general that ♥♥♥♥♥ about everything https://twitter.com/HuniePop/status/566674104099823616\n\nUPDATE 3: The Steam DLC for the digital art collection is censored so you have to go through another special patch just to see the NSFW content on the DLC http://steamcommunity.com/app/339800/discussions/0/610572929721992528/","February 9, 2015","true","17.2"," 40 of 51 people (78%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","78","40","51","3","4"

Regardless of the choice, you can only date girls in the game. I honestly didn't have high expectations from a dating game, but right from the start there is plenty of humor in the interaction with the love fairy, the players guide to dating.\n\nThe girls come with a great variation in looks and personality, the only thing they all have in common, is being hungrier then starving wolves. In order to talk with them, you need to give them food and lots of it. Though they have a lot to say, and even after having reached the final stretch of the game, they sometimes say things I haven't heard before.\n\nThe dates evolve around a puzzle game, it is similar to bejeweled, but demands a lot more strategy. Checking what a date wants from you before the date is the key to success, as well as in the interaction, where it's good to refresh what you know before being put on the spot with a question. The strategy factor and the puzzle game is most the game, the girls are just a bonus. I'm sure this game could have been just as good with a different theme. Perhaps meeting fluffy animals and making friends with them? It wouldn't affect the puzzle factor at all.\n\nPositive aspects of the game:\nEvery location has its own music.\nThe characters come with great variation.\nA lot of comedy, this game isn't in any way serious.\nThe difficulty is balanced, and increases over time.\n\nNegative aspects of the game:\nThe full screen mode glitched for me, though that could be a result of my screen resolution. Otherwise I don't have many bad things to say about the game. I should note that there is a strong chance someone on your friendslist have a thing or two to say about dating games. It is a game that comes with a douchbag stamp, but that is okay, the game hardly tries to make you think that seducing 12 girls makes you any better then that.\n\nI recommend this game to anyone who likes strategy/puzzle games, but would prefer to look at sexy girls while playing them. To quote Kyu; "Come on! Seduce me with your sexy puzzle skills."\n","February 28, 2015","true","71.5"," 25 of 27 people (93%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","93","25","27","5","0"

There are characters that you love and characters who you just hate which is a nice thing that not everyone are a little "sugar babys".

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/recommended/339800/","nerdhouse","Nerd House","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/","2628 products in account","HuniePop is a Western Dating Sim, RPG and Puzzle Game. You play a nameless protagonist who has no love life. The Love goddess, being disappointed by the lack of romance in your life, decides to send Kyu, a magic love fairy, to help you out. Kyu profiles eight beautiful, eligible girls in town and after a few helpful tips, starts you on your quest for love... or lust.\n\nThe puzzle section (making up the date portions of the game), at its core, is fairly standard Bejeweled fare but with some added complexity. The player has to score enough points to fill an Affection meter within 20 turns, and each girl has favorite and least favorite token types that change how many points each give out, along with Passion tokens that act as a score multiplier, Joy tokens that give extra moves, Sentimentality tokens that allow the use of special items, and Heartbreak tokens that penalize you if you match them. Aside from leveling up a girl's relationship status, clearing a date also gives the player money to purchase gifts for use in the dating sim section, where the player talks to the girls to acquire "Hunie", which is then used to upgrade various traits (such token effectiveness, lessening heartbreak penalties and increasing the score multiplier cap for Passion tokens) for use in the puzzle section. You will want to upgrade your traits as often as you can, so wrack up that Hunie. The puzzle segments get progressively more difficult as the game goes on, so traits are VERY important. Also, if you reach a certain Passion level during the puzzles, you may be sent bonus photos of the girl you dated.\n\nThe game plays out very well, having you move from location to location talking to the different girls to learn things about them. At times the girls will quiz you on your knowledge of them, and if you answer correctly you receive bonus Hunie. As you talk to each girl, you will notice a hunger and intoxication meter under their relationship gauge. If you try and talk to them while their hunger meter is empty, they will simply tell you that they are hungry. To continue talking to them you can buy some food in the shop and gift it to them to restore a portion of their meter to continue the conversation. The other option is to leave and come back to the girl later, when her hunger meter will be refilled again. The intoxication meter measures how, well, intoxicated the girl is, and you can buy her drinks to drive this meter up. Doing so gets you bonus Hunie while talking to them, as well as starting you off with a Sentiment level equal to their intoxication level when starting a date puzzle, depending on the girl.\n\nAfter each successful date (yes, you can and will fail some puzzles), your relationship gauge (measured in hearts) with that girl will go up by one. When you reach 4 or more hearts with a particular girl, and complete a dating puzzle at night, they will offer to go back to your place. This begins a "climax" puzzle, where you have unlimited moves but the objective is to fill the Pleasure meter, which slowly decays over times. Making matches in the puzzle fills the gauge. When you complete the climax puzzle you are rewarded with a raunchy photo of the girl you "conquered", as well as a pair of their panties as a trophy to stash in your inventory. These do nothing but to remind you of which girls you have climaxed.\n\nOh, did I mention that EVERYTHING is 100% fully voiced acted? Yes, even the climax puzzles. Let that sink in for a second. There is also language and revealing photos. This is certainly NOT a game for children. Please exercise discretion when playing this game with children in the house.\n\nHuniePop is an excellent puzzle game with a dating sim cover. It offers solid mechanics and ever increasing challenge in it's gameplay, in the puzzles and in the "dating". Definitely give it a shot if puzzle games are your thing.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=382621663\n\nHighly Recommended\nBe sure to check out Nerd House Gaming for more reviews!","January 27, 2015","true","16.9"," 36 of 47 people (77%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","77","36","47","2","6"

When you venture further into loneliness, the puzzle gets much harder. There were times where I had to stop and think about my next move carefully\n- The music is well done\n- Fantastic voice acting\n- Hilarious dialogue\n\nCons\n\n- Tedious and repetitive. You will see that the girls will ask the same question multiple times. After half way through the game, it just becomes a grind.\n- Lack of content. There really isn't much to do to be very honest here. You talk to girl, give her gifts, feed her and ask questions. Go on date, play a puzzle, done. To fully complete this game, you gotta do that 5 times for all 12 girls.\n\n\nI do recommend this game but for a VERY specific audience. Overall though, I do not. For the price tag, there just isn't much to do to keep someone entertained for the nearly 20 hours of doing the same puzzle over and over again. It is bejeweled on steroids, with the added overly-flirty women with barely any clothes on. If you buy this game to just get the pictures of these girls naked, then just google it and save yourself the money. There are better anime games out there with way more gameplay, and enough fan-service to keep you sexually thrilled in your mother's basement.","April 12, 2015","false","18.8"," 182 of 297 people (61%) found this review helpful 64 people found this review funny","61","182","297","64","7"

You will have the opportunity to meet different girls and socialize with them. (Just don't use what you learn in this game during a real life date)\n\nSo what is the story?\nYou play as yourself. You are terrible at socializing with girls. One day, a magical fairy named Kyu shows up and decides to help you out.\n\nThe Girls:\nThe girls are pretty diverse. There are girls who are kind and passionate like Tiffany, and then there are girls who are haughty and loud like Audrey. All of them are actually well voice acted, making them feel "real".\n\nGameplay:\nHuniePop generally consists of talking and getting to know the girls you meet and going on a date with them. The dating scenes are pretty much what most people call "Bejewled".\nHowever, I'd say HuniePop's gameplay is a bit "more fun" since you can match orbs horizontally or vertically (the orbs you want to match don't have to be next to each other). There's also a catch. You can't just match random colors and just win.\n\nEx: You want to date Tiffany. Her favorite trait is flirtation (a green token). When you are dating her, you will only have a certain amount of moves to fill up a point meter. Matching green tokens will get you the most points.\nIn addition to the "Bejewled gameplay, you can match bell tokens to get more moves and avoid the shattered purple hearts (They will decrease the meter).\n\nAbout..."those" scenes:\nUnless you install the uncensored patch, Panties and bras will stay on, but moans of pleasure will still be heard. :3\n\nShould you buy it? & My Opinion\nFor people who just want a casual game that involves "Bejeweled" gameplay and dating girls, pick this up if you feel like it. You might find that one girl that you admire the most.\n\nFor me, this was a great way to perhaps practice talking with girls. I especially enjoyed the "Bejweled" gameplay. Some of the dialogue was a bit awkward, but then again I never really talked to a real girl for more than five minutes so I wouldn't really know.\n\n- Psychii","April 18, 2015","true","61.6"," 24 of 27 people (89%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","89","24","27","8","0"

No, wait, it actually is pretty cool.\n\nYou play as...Well...You. You're a virgin and you're bad with the ladies, when suddenly Stephanie from Lazy Town appears in your room and tells you she's going to help you get laid. And thus begins a journey of self discovery and learning to love yourself for the way you ar- oh who am I kidding, you bang a bunch of dames. There are seven girls and one best girl as well as a few surprises in between. Like my tears when the bejeweled didn't want to cooperate with me and refused to allow me permission to see the single Mexican mother naked. How dare you shield my eyes?\n\nYou go day to day in game, finding the ladies scattered remains of their emotional stability about town and talking to them, giving them gifts like a weirdo, and taking them out on battle bejeweled dates. This is probably the make it or break it part of the game. For my friends it was a simple romp, stealing hearts, and playing dangerously. For me it was a heart shattering performance rivaled only by Schindler's List. Being ♥♥♥♥ blocked by bejeweled is like the biggest and swiftest kick in the ♥♥♥♥ from a quarterback. That's like five Nicklebacks.\n\nThe characters themselves aren't that bad either. They have their own personalities, quirks, and problems that they sometimes pour out to you. Though they themselves are nothing ground breaking, they play their parts well and you'll end up enjoying at least a few of their companies. You can do exciting things with them, like talk about their day, or watch them eat an entire cabbage. Riveting and compelling.\n\nBut should you play HuniePop?\nIt's honestly hard to say, it's one of those games I shield from the children passing by my dumpster while I play it, but it's nothing to lose your mind over and feel embarassed about, really. Unless you're like me and can't get it up for the sex game. Sorry Ladies.  :(\n\nIt can only get really bad once you realized you've spent the last seven hours playing Bejeweled and you've become your mother. But you kind of forget that in the music, the moment, you own it, you better never let it go. You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow, this opportunity only comes once in  a lifetime. Just like me.

And it shines in both categories.\nSummary: funny, medium challange, entertaining gameplay in all parts; limited replayability; features NSFW content\n\nThe Dating-Sim aspect is really tongue-in-cheek and takes itself about as seriously as it does the player. It really plays it up for laughs. You even get made fun of by one of the characters for trying to woo women (yes, they're all legal!) by matching gems. Speaking of which, the Puzzle-gameplay is the best I've ever seen. While average match-3-games get repetetive and boring quick, this one keeps things fresh with the addition of consumables per match and effecting the board by leveling your player-character outside of the puzzles using a light RPG system in the dating parts. Also it features a slightly larger than average board for these kinds of games which might not sound like much but it immensely rewards careful planning.\n\nThe characters you meet are absolutely 1-dimensional but the twist is, they seem to know it! Interacting with them is a blast if only for the chuckles you'll have at some of the more imaginative lines. The excellent voicework really helps getting to know each one. Since your objective is to date women until they are willing to spend a night with you, the game features adult themes, language and imagery but the imagery is censored by default (easily unlockable with patch from developer).","April 27","true","57.5"," 20 of 21 people (95%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","95","20","21","3","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/genestarwind/recommended/339800/","genestarwind","Mantis","http://steamcommunity.com/id/genestarwind/","2116 products in account","Super Pickup Artist Deluxe!\n\nOverview\n\nAt least, that's a good alternative title for this game. It's regarded as a simulator by some, but really, it's not unless you want the ♥♥♥♥ slapped out of you when you try out the lines for real. Many years ago I played several bishōjo or gal games, many of which would be regarded a H (hentai) game. Is this also a H-game? Not exactly. However, it has seriously raised the bar for what's allowed in Steam titles and I love that. With a tiny patch you can unlock full upper nudity, highly suggestive artwork and risqué dialogue. As a game developer myself I was pleasantly surprised to see this. Sex should be much more accepted in video games. It certainly is a lot more natural than blowing somebody's head off with a shotgun, one would think.\n\nEdit: Progressing even further into the game I've found out that with some characters you get to see full nudity, with the inclusion of particular fluids...\n\nBack to the main point. The key to succeeding in this game is mastering the use of bull****. The objective is to screw as many girls as you can and you have to adapt your personality to match that of each girl and basically deceive them all. It's all fun and games though, and indeed, HuniePop makes sure of this with witty and entertaining dialogue, decent voice acting and interesting puzzle mechanics used in the dating scenes. You have the choice of being male or female, with the latter catering to the lesbian and bisexual female crowd. The game uses a day/night system in a linear fashion—you can't choose where you want to go specifically like in many gal games such as True Love, but you get an amazing stalker device which allows you to see where girls are and travel to them immediately.\n\nThe story isn't amazing by any means, but that's not really the aim of any game of this genre. At the start of the game you're approached by a fairy seductress who encourages you to get into the dating scene. That's the gist of it. It has an RPG system with stats you can upgrade, with each one catering more to certain girls, also affecting the effectiveness of different blocks in the puzzle game. There are two main variables in the game: Munie (currency) and Hunie. You'll gain more Munie from successful dates for some reason (IRL it's very much the opposite) and from buying gifts and chatting girls up properly you'll gain more Hunie, with which you can upgrade your character. Think of it like the boner meter. Keep filling it and you'll keep filling them much better in bed. Yes, there is indeed sex. It'll sound like a cheesy porno when you reach that part.\n\n\nRatings\n\nCategoryScoreExplanationGameplay25/30The gameplay mechanics make this game very addictive. You can choose how you want to play it and in which order. The choice of gender adds more replay value. There's plenty of profile information you must learn about the girls, and your memory is tested when you're asked to recall these facts, such as full names, favourite colours, cup sizes, work history, and so forth. Dialogue choices are funny and unrealistic, and the game seems to be a parody of other dating sims in a sense. The puzzle gameplay is challenging yet fun; hardly original but it does the job.Story10/20As previously explained, it's very much a no-frills experience in the story department. There's nothing particularly bad about it, but it's nothing special either.Graphics18/20I honestly have nothing bad to say here. Characters are well drawn and have well animated facial expressions and mouth movements. Backgrounds are nothing short of professional. The user interface is colourful and easy to use. Extra attention was clearly spent on the artwork. This is an indie game with graphical quality of a retail title.Sound18/20I love the background music. It's no wonder that it's available as DLC on this store page. Voice acting is a mixed bag. A couple of girls have a bit of a high-pitched nagging voice, but from what I've learned so far, they all seem good at moaning in the sex scenes. Just sayin'. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)Bonus9/10I'm awarding this game a high bonus score because of the message it delivers to the game industry in general. It's not hentai I'm talking about. It's sex in general. People need to relax. It's a normal thing and I hope that eventually the industry will stop being so uptight about it. Oh, an exta +1 at the fact it practically slaps Anita Sarkeesian in the face.\n\nFinal Verdict\n\n80%: Grade B","February 13, 2015","true","17.8"," 21 of 24 people (88%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","88","21","24","6","1"

They don't smell. They don't ask for much. All you have to do is give them love and affection and they will return in kind. I haven't left my house in weeks because 2D girls don't ask you to go to work or take them out or shower. All you have to do is be there, in front of the screen with your dakimakura and masturbatory tool of preference and you will be set. I finally know what true love is. I just wish my mom would stop knocking on my door. I mean, I'm 20 for Kami-sama's sake. I know what I'm doing with my life. She's such a baka gaijin. Thank you, HuniePop.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/endchronicle/recommended/339800/","endchronicle","Rekyua","http://steamcommunity.com/id/endchronicle/","675 products in account","Pleasently surprised.\nI had low hopes for the game but after playing it I found the writing to be delightful! The conversations are quirky, though at times a little too cliche, but it doesn't keep the game from being anything other than fun. Just know this game ISN'T a visual novel so the dialogue is pretty lite.\n\nThe sound effects are great and the music is nice. Some people had issues with the art style but I personally like it and all the scenes are varied and the girls themsevles have a handful of hair and clothing sytles to unlock.\n\nThe core however is the puzzle matching game during dates. If you enjoy any kind of match-3 game type (Bejeweled, Candy Crush, etc.) then you'll have fun with this. The differences that make this game stand out from those however is the ability to move a gem anywhere in the row and colum it resides and counter-balanced by a move limit. Along with traits (leveling system from getting experience by talking to girls outside the puzzle segment) and gifts (which you obtain from giving gifts to girls outside of the puzzle segment) that when combined together can enhance your playing style. You might go for points, extra moves, changing gems, or a mix of all. It has enough flexibility to let you strengthen the way you want to play.\n\nMy only complaint is the game gets ridiculously difficult the further in you get. At the last few girls (including the unlockable) I had difficulty completing a level as I had long since maxed out my traits and ended up lowering the difficulty level to finish the stage. Not to mention the "bedroom" stage which involves filling a meter which constantly depletes, at later levels you have to match 4 or more to gain any footing.\n\nOverall, I came in with low expectations but found them surpassed. It's a fun game and I highly recommend it if you like puzzle gems and match-3. Also, it rewards you for winning with bewbs, which is good because it gets hard as ♥♥♥♥ later on and you're gonna need that motivation.","January 19, 2015","true","15.0"," 30 of 41 people (73%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","73","30","41","2","0"

While Baker is initially distraught of the idea of leading men so soon in his military career, he soon learns that he must focus and lead both himself and his men to victory and glory. Throughout the campaign, Baker's squad is picked off one by one by the germans, changing Baker's initial objective of completing the mission, he now must keep his men alive, complete the mission, and get back home alive himself against the odds with only a handful of men. The gameplay to the game is pretty spectacular, the way to defeating the overwhelming odds of germans ranges from the four "Fs" of military tactics in that time, finding, fixing, flanking, and finishing the enemy. As the game progresses, Baker and his squad start to go from fighting untrained grunts to the elite "Fallschrimjager" division of the German Paratroopers aswell as encountering situations where your tactics must adjust to the new circumstances and choosing whether or not sacrificing a member of your squad is worth it to complete the mission.","January 25, 2015","true","13.4"," 32 of 46 people (70%) found this review helpful 35 people found this review funny","70","32","46","35","0"

It pretends to be a dating sim, but considering it as an entry in that genre, it's a very mediocre entry. The entire game is rail-roaded so you will always end up in a position where you can date the girls and even if you pick the 'wrong' dialogue option there is no permanent penalty, just a loss of one of the two in-game currencies.\n\nWhat Huniepop does do right is the dialogue, it is genuinely funny at times and lewd throughout, and every girl has their own consistent voice. The gameplay is separated in two parts, non-date and date. During the non-date parts you will be chatting with the girls to make them like you more: the more you learn about them, the more points you get. You can also buy them gifts. The girls will also challenge you with questions which you have to answer correctly, some related to their personality, others related to their stats you've learned before. Every time you talk they become hungrier, so you also need to buy them a kind of food they like to keep the conversation going.\nIf a girl likes you enough you can date them. Now the game becomes a Bejewelled clone, and a fairly good one at that. Rewards for dates are unlocking new outfits and hairstyles for the girls -- and if you do a night date, sex.\nSex is another Bejewelled game but now you have to make combos as quickly as possible to score (pun intended). Your reward for a notch on your bedpost is a sexually tinted image of the girl (censored by default, but uncensoring is easy and quick).\n\nIf you're an adult who is not offended by lewd humour, Huniepop will not disappoint. But if you want a dating sim there are far better examples on Steam.\nRecommended for today's version of Leisure Suit Larry fans, and definitely not recommended for puritans.","May 5, 2015","true","13.1"," 14 of 14 people (100%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","100","14","14","4","0"

It is incredibly politically incorrect and I'm not sure how it has so-far escaped the ire of the Tumblr and Twitter crowd who would generally cite this as being the most hateful example of why gaming is evil.\n\nI found myself chuckling as I flirted with the popular chick by talking about getting wasted and then won her favor by buying her a crack pipe. And by saying all the right things to appeal to the fitness-freak hair-dresser single-mother by conveying my value as a stable mature provider who appreciates children. I was a bit taken aback by the photo one of the characters sent me in-game of her going deep on an adult toy and another of detailed self-appreciation. Completely absurd and earned its laugh. The love-fairy liked to talk about "chocolate love" and "yellow fever", but is basically that platonic girl in your life who spends half her time trying to hook you up with everything that moves.\n\nI mark every "novel" and "dating sim" game on Steam as "not interested", but the reviews suckered me in to trying it out and I have been thoroughly entertained. I would still hide the game window if someone walked into my office and caught me playing this, but I was still amused.","February 23, 2015","true","8.5"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","92","12","13","5","0"

Well... you're actually playing as a woman, never fret, since this game does a fantastic job adapting to the female audience. When you start the game up, you're given an option whether to play as a female of male, and I obviously thought "Well I bet that they changed some words to "she" instead of he and thats it." But EVERYTHING is adapted. The voice acting is redone, the texts have changed (not the pictures but i remember one saying "Hahaha! I can almost fit this whole thing in my mouth! I would make a great straight chick!" or something like that).\n\nSo don't worry, you will feel like a girl playing this game.\n\nI havent finished every route... but i have done the vast majority. And even though the... *ahem* sex CG's... aren't my cup of tea, I can't deny that they are well drawn much like everything else in this game. It's honestly surprising how much love and effort was put into this game. The sprites are fantastic and I ADORE the voice acting and dialoge(well.. except a perticular red head). The game play is sort of like bejewelled, but much more addicting. I guess it's like marmite. You either like puzzels or you don't.\n\nMy only real complaint is that the woman... are kind of shown as objects in this (So like, most of them are fully aware that you're dating other girls at the same time but they don't care.). But i dooubt you expected FULL CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT AND A DEEP EMOTIONAL BACK STORY. Of course theyre shallow! The whole point of this game is to have sex with everyone! Some VNs and dating sims i have played are worse than this so it doesn't bother me a whole lot.\n\nThis is one of those games where if you think you will enjoy it, you will, and if you're not too sure, it might be a waste of your money.

While the graphic adult material is limited to a few still shots, they are very graphic.\n\nHuniePop is a dating simulator puzzle game hybrid that mixes the two elements quite well.  As a dating simulator, the game is pretty shallow.  Decisions like 'where to take her,' 'what she likes,' and 'how much will she appreciate the gifts' are completely predetermined.  The dialog is completely spoken (or in blips and bloops if you prefer), which actually fleshes out the characters a bit more than I expected.  All of the twelve different women have different personalities, and they sometimes offer curve ball questions that really make the dating side interesting.  Showing interest, answering questions right, and buying various gifts for the ladies rewards with a special currency called "Hunie," which can be spent on increasing the strength of your own character traits that are used in the puzzle portion of the game.\n\nThe puzzle (date) portion is the real meat of the game.  You make 3-of-a-kind matches by moving pieces along x/y axis rails.  The concept is very basic and easy to pick up.  What makes it so tricky is the very limited amount of moves you are allowed to make.  Each lady you are on a date with has preferences of what color match they want you to join the most and the least, and reward you with cash respectively.  The purple broken hearts are penalty pieces, and if joined together, reduce the amount of cash you are awarded.  Pink hearts increase the value (intensity) of other matches.  Blue tear drops give you ammunition to perform special moves.  Gold bells add to the amount of moves you are allowed.  Overall, you need to consider the weight of every match you make, and how it will help you in future matches.  It may sound overwhelming at first, but it comes easy and natural with experience.\n\nIf you have completed four levels of dates, and you successfully complete a fifth date at night, you will be taken to a bonus round.  For the bonus round, you just have to make as many matches as possible, regardless of color, as fast as you can.  This is both exciting and terrifying, as it is exactly the opposite of the rules for the previous dates.\n\nAs more dates are completed successfully, the ladies will send you pictures of themselves in provocative positions (some more provocative than others).  Completing a bonus round will reward you with a very provocative picture.  Once a picture is unlocked, it can be reviewed at a later time at your leisure.\n\nPersonally, I bought this game as a joke, and found the game so fun that I completed it to 100%.  I still love completing the puzzles on the hardest difficulty, and I still try to figure out the secret behind the tissue box.  If you have the love for puzzle games like I do (10,000,000, Bejeweled, Zoo Keeper), give this a shot for sure.","February 8, 2015","true","52.0"," 15 of 19 people (79%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","79","15","19","2","0"

Also Boobs.\n\nThe set up is you are either a lady or a dude and then a fairy comes and makes you better at getting ladies. That's... pretty much it.\n\nThe gameplay loop is something like. Data allocation or asking questions that will later be asked back to you in order to obtain more Hunie (used for upgrading) Ask on a date, play bejewled repeat. I guess you can feed the girls in order to talk to them longer should you want but the game seems to encourage switching between them. Each girl has traits they like and dislike which translate into a type of affection that is more effective during a date (which is when you play bejeweled) Which is more important than you think as you have only 20 turns to complete your goal.\n\nIts very weirdly addicting. I found myself especially interested in Aiko Yumi and went after her umm, to completion and then tried after a few more ladies. It kind of fiddles out in the mid game so to speak as the questions repeat and its becomes a meter management game.\n\nThere is definitely nudity, however its really no worse then what you can find with a simple google search.\n\nThe upgrading is not really terribly involved either, basically it makes a specific type of affection worth more during a date. Passion being a sort of multiplier as far as I can tell and Sentiment being a relatively useless resource but allows you to give gifts which act as powers ups.\n\nThe only weak points are you can literally just read a wiki and remove the memory aspect of the game and should you take that route you still need to sort of stay within the 4th wall? As in the character you play as knows less than you at that point based on your wiki knowledge.\n\nTHE GIST\nHuniePop is obviously not for kids or really even the immature. But its fun and relatively harmless. The voice acting is good and the characters are hyper stereotypical but with all due respect, that's what makes a character a character. And to be honest it gives a lot of life into a genre I never really cared about. That being Match 3.","May 23","true","6.0"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

The puzzle game itself is surprisingly addicting, though, and the characters are pretty enjoyable. My favorite character overall is probably Aiko, but Kyu is far and away the funniest of the bunch. If someone made a mod where she was voiced by John DeLancey (get it, Q, Kyu?), I think I'd die laughing.\n\nThe game revels in how politically incorrect it is. Every woman you meet is pretty much one or another stereotype (i.e. the good girl, the mega-♥♥♥♥♥, the catgirl, etc.), as Kyu herself is often quick to point out. Most of the women play their parts to such a straight degree that it's hard not to laugh, but Kyu's "no fourth wall" conversations turn the whole thing into pure gold ("Come on, seduce me with your sexy puzzle skills!").\n\nIt isn't really possible to "lose" at HuniePop, per se, but each successive puzzle gets progressively higher point requirements to clear it, and if you don't make the most out of each portion of the day (particularly the night portion), you can quickly find yourself falling behind the curve; even easy mode will start to give you trouble going into your second week. Thankfully, you only have to pass the first four dates with each girl to make progress, after which you're free to fail as often as you like.\n\nOverall, it's a decent way to pass the afternoon. You're not gonna find the meaning of life in this game, but you will be entertained.","June 16, 2015","true","30.5"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","8","8","0","1"

Date gifts added a pretty interesting level of depth, considering how basic match-3s usually are. I found myself staring at the board for surprisingly long durations trying to optimize my next move. It was a pretty mechanically sound puzzle minigame.\nThere's also the faster variant, which I'm not actually sure if you can fail or not, but I managed to avoid letting the bar completely empty after the first few seconds.\nBejeweled Blitz will prepare you for Match-3: Prepare to Fast mode.\n\nAs ridiculous as the dialogue was, this is the one occasion where I could actually bet that the game wasn't completely exaggerating. It didn't feel like any of the characters were really the same, and it (at least to me) justified the sometimes cringe-worthy or side-busting things they'd wind up saying, since it seemed to closely match their personality.\nAt the very least, the dialogue was incredibly amusing in its own right.\n\nThis game also reminded me I will never have a blue haired gf that has that much of an interest in vidya.\n\nAll in all, ♥♥♥♥ these birds.\n10/10, buy this game.","February 6, 2015","true","20.4"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","83","10","12","3","0"

It really makes me happy to see stuff like this on the Steam Store, since obviously no prudish retailer would ever stock it.\n\nThe puzzle games are fun, and the dating portions are fun. It all blends together really well. The writing is cheesy sometimes, but also perfectly believable. There's even voices for every girl, though I'm really glad there's an option to turn them off... no offense to the voice actors or anything. The best part is that everyone refers you to your gender of choice. I finally don't have to feel excluded and can be completely immersed when I want to see some dating sim anime boobies (if only they were all like that).\n\nThe girls are all interesting, and very unique, almost guaranteeing you will find a girl who is right for you. However, if you settle for just one, you aren't getting very far. The goal is to bang all the girls. Yes, all of them. What else were you expecting from an H-game? The pictures you receive are a satisfying reward for all the work you put into getting to know the girls and taking them out on puzzle dates.\n\nI definitely recommend this game to all you pervs out there, but I also highly advise you grab the uncensor patch before playing it, because otherwise you're really missing out on the blue hair on Nikki's naughty bits.","June 12, 2015","true","13.0"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","100","7","7","3","0"

Well, it's not really a dating sim. More like a sex simulator. Hentai everywhere! You can get with a porn star, a sexy teacher, school student, fairy, cat girl, nerdy chick... hell, you can even ♥♥♥♥ an alien (complete with tentacle porn). Plus many more! All of the girls are the stereotypical 100 pound, young looking cockthirsty ♥♥♥♥♥es, but hey, that's what dating sims are about.\n\nThe puzzles are fun, and the difficulty level really scales up quickly for a challenge. It's very reminiscent of Pokemon Puzzle League and is similar playwise to Bejeweled. The game is a bit repetitive if you want to try and get all the girls on one game file, and it definitely takes some skill to play this game. Definitely fun, especially for the small price tag that it comes with.","January 25, 2015","true","62.0"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","89","8","9","2","0"

Having originally peeked at a copy which I didn't own for laughs, I was treated to an actually really hilarious set-up for what turned out to be one of the most fun and hilarious games I've ever played.\n\nHuniePop is an example of really knowing it's audience. Anyone willing to spend time with an open mind gets to experience this gem of a game on Steam. The gameplay is your standard match 3, it's straightforward enough for someone who's totally useless at puzzle games to get into and learn how to kind of pass everything but you can ramp the difficulty up if you want that.\n\nHuniePop's selling point is the humour. It's seriously funny if you have that kind of sense of humour. It's dumb, it knows it's stupid but it doesn't care. Just watch the intro sequence, if you laugh. It's probably for you.\n\nPros:\nCharacter designs are broad and fun. Beli best girl.\nGameplay is straightforward enough for anyone to get into but has a ramping difficulty curve if you need that.\nNot all of the game is thrown at you. You have to figure out how to get into bits of it.\nThe item system is initially somewhat confusing but you can easily figure out what setups are good for you if you put some thought into it.\nIt's seriously funny.\nIt still has some subtlety to it despite this. There are a few things about characters that poke fun at public perception in a very clever way.\nIt won't break the bank for price.\n\nCons:\nDon't expect depth from the characters. They've very caricature and stereotypical.\nIt's very dumb. Though this is a minor point.\nVery minor: There's a tiny amount of tinkering to unlock the blocked away parts of the game though it's simple enough and there's a walkthrough in the forum area.\nOnce you've smashed everything, there's not that much replayability.\n\nIn short, it's really good for what it does and it's a welcome addition to Steam in my opinion. It's funny, has it's own charm and have had some serious laughter over it.\n\nI don't think I'll ever figure out why half the people on my friends list who own this game are girls though.","November 26, 2015","true","11.9"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","8","9","0","1"

The way the game kinda takes you by the hand and teases you about the next girl, encouraging you to meet them all, feels natural. The fact that you can't save on your own is a bother, but as a result the game is a lot on the forgiving side. You never really lose anything, so all you have to do is go for it. Besides, even if you can see the girls' profiles on the internet or even in the game (second tab of their HunieBee entries), sometimes they'all ask you completely random questions you have to give some sort of a personal answer. And that's nice.\n\nAnd And I'm a sucker for match-three, bejeweled, shariki, you name it. The extra strategy you need was like a hurricane of fresh air because it isn't ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t like most game modes in Candy Crush. Gearing up with gifts is part of the strategy too, so it ends up being somewhat complex and actually challenging.\n\nI'm kinda sad there is no closure though. I've reached a point I can win any date just having a couple passion matches and then flirtating (green blocks) forever. The difficulty curve is neatly planned until you get the last date with two girls, more or less. It gets far too easy then even if the difficulty keeps raising.\n\nThat and I would have loved some character development, especially for best girl Audrey. I suppose that's just how dating sims are, but it's kinda disappointing.","February 10, 2015","true","11.9"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","77","10","13","3","4"

Or perhaps you hate how your dating sims have no professional voice actress, is made in Flash, and has no redeeming qualities? Well, this may or may not be the game that was made for me  you!\n\nHuniepop - a fast dating sim, with a touch of fantasy, made to make your evenings cosy and your time spent fast.\n\nWhat fun gimmick is expected of this almost typical dating sim? A minigame. One single minigame. Luckily, the minigame (that we all have played somewhere before) has some interesting mechanics that makes you want to think two, maybe three, turns ahead. Though this sort of immersion into the minigame might make one forget what game he's actually playing, a puzzle game perhaps..?\n\nNow as for the actual Sim part, it's nothing too advanced if you have played any other typical game of the same genre - ya gotta talk, gift and flirt to win over the ladies. Oh wait, I'm wrong. By doing the mentioned stuff, you only score points for the date minigames and your own skill upgrades. Which means, ya can't get the ladies by using up all the dosh. Interesting in it's own way.\n\nTo summarise, the game is worth it's price. Is it to fun to play? I'd say yes. Does it have an interesting cast? 9 (+3) outta 9.

At random points during the date you pull out more gifts, which range from expensive pearl necklaces that you somehow have an infinite supply of, to stuffed dolls of the magical tutorial fairy that's totally not a figment of your imagination. By making enough matches, you eventually seduce them into coming back to your place where they strip down... and you make them ♥♥♥♥♥♥ by playing even more Bejeweled.\n\nI know a professional girl and they say this is pretty much just like real life.","August 8, 2015","true","17.7"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","88","7","8","12","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tuttythefruity/recommended/339800/","tuttythefruity","Tutty The Fruity","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tuttythefruity/","527 products in account","An excellent game that combines various genres (puzzle, RPG, dating sim) very well. Very addicting.\n\nThe first thing you should be aware of is that, between CGs explicitly depicting the female anatomy and the pursuit and outcome of having sex, the game's content is elevated from softcore titillation that Steam has typically released up to this point (i.e. Sakura Spirit) to hardcore hentai. Fair warning that that's what you're getting into; at its core, you're playing for sexy porn pictures, and you're buying a hentai game. It's good porn if you're factoring that in.\n\nThe game is VERY fun though. It incorporates a simple match 3 game that you've seen countless times, and adds enough rules and stipulations to distinguish it from other games. At later points in the game, you'll have to play carefully to make the right plays, deliver the right gifts at the right times to reach the end of a date successfully with limited moves available to you. There's enough strategy to engage you meaningfully. And, let's face it, exploding coloured tiles has always been supremely satisfying. And then the game changes when you successfully bring a woman to your room, and the game changes in such a simple and yet genius way, removing the time limit and turning the game into a race to pop matches as quickly as possible.\n\nThe main progression comes from learning more about the girls, increasing your skills, and expanding your options for game-changing items in dates. It feels meaningful and coincides well with the gradual increase in difficulty as the game goes. Gameplay is the best part about the game, really.\n\nSurrounding the gameplay, it's just a very professionally done package. Full voice acting is solid for the most part, the OST makes for delightful BGM when doing puzzles, art in general is very crisp and clear, the character sprites have solid variety in how their expressions change and in changes of clothing; lip sync is an incredibly nice touch.\n\nThe writing in the game is smart, witty, and plays primarily to the expectations of a western audience and to the mentalities of a "player" picking up women. It's exceptionally tongue-in-cheek; the dating sim is, by nature, a genre of manipulation and telling the girls what they want to hear, and HuniePop replicates that without falling prey to traditional Japanese writing tropes. There isn't much of a narrative and the characters aren't exactly deep, but the writing is spot on for interactions between any number of them.\n\nIt's an exceptionally well-done game. You won't be disappointed.","January 22, 2015","true","21.0"," 12 of 18 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","12","18","0","0"

It's a bit easy at first but as you start finishing each girl's "route" the date puzzles get much, much harder. The game is really fun, even if you don't like date sims, you'll probably like this one since it knows how to take itself seriously and when not to. If you're looking for a super serious game, you won't like this too much. Yuri mode is also an option for those who want a bit of girl on girl, too.\n\nFor that price, if you are even slightly interested, it's worth it.\n\nThe steam version is censored, but there's a uncensor patch right there on the community hub by the devs themselves, if you want that kind of thing.

HuniePop is a fun, simple Dating Sims game that smacks reality & common sense right out of your freaken face. Want to be a nice dude who's actually in it for the .. you know, dates? NOPE. Enjoy joking about people's race and openly talking to strangers about how sexy they are and wanting to smoke a joint. The game has nice visuals though, and hilarious dialogue. Personally the puzzle is weak, the conversations are to short, I felt used because in order to bond- I needed to buy the girls SO much loot rather then actually getting along naturally. Another problem is that nothing happens when you actually go out on a date. They just change clothes and you beat the puzzle, that's it.\n\nDo note this game is good, especially for a $10 game. If you want something to spice up a Dating Sims game with fun, likable characters then this game does work well. I even admired that the girls will ask you in trivia to what you've learned about them. A huge flaw though is the core of the game's focus .... to get your guy actually dating. Since you finally get to socialize and hook up with someone, shouldn't that be more developed? Instead we get a guy who tries sleeping with 7-8 girls while trying to get them as drunk as heavily possible.\n\nThis doesn't make the game bad. It is fun, and enjoyable... and addicting even. But it's not exactly that brilliant of a Visual Novel and not even that 'erotic' compared to other Visual Novels. If you want an amazing Visual Novel with both depth, detail, and great story telling- just look into Katawa Shoujo. It's free to download. For something very erotic, best just to do porn man.

All in all it totally blew me away at how much attention to detail and polish was put in this game.  All characters are fully voiced, the dialogue and scripts are well done (the personalities between the girls really come out), and the graphics are colorful and fantastic.  Even when I thought I had maybe beaten the game, it added even more surprises (and more characters).  The puzzle mode is also fun but not too complicated.  It's also a very real puzzle mode, they're not just handing you a free win.  Even on easy (and I'm still not sure what the difference in the difficulty levels are) I found myself having to carefully plan my moves and my power-up items.\n\nOh, and there's boobs.  I know that's what you came for, and admittedly, so did I, but there's surprisingly a well-polished and fantastic game behind it.","February 2, 2015","true","13.2"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Batgra/recommended/339800/","Batgra","Batgra","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Batgra/","165 products in account","So i wanted to pop in here (sad pun) and give my recommendation/review of this game. HuniePop (to me) feels targeted to thee different types of gamers who may enjoy the atmosphere and gameplay. The three types (as i would put it) are the Anime Fan, the Puzzle/Gem matching fan or the Completionist.  Any combination of two out of those three types will likely find something here to enjoy, though if you feel you only fit into one catagory or none; you may want to consider this game a pass.\n\nFor the Anime  Fan:\nMe personally, I am a fan of anime shows such as High School DxD, Rosario Vampire, Sekirei, etc. and as a fan i can say there are minor similarities between the plots of those shows and HuniePop.  Essentially, you are the perverted/awkward main character with sex on the brain thrust into a world where abnormal things are happening and you need to adapt.  HuniePop, nowhere near as extreme as the shows has the main character visited by a "fairy" who teaches you/him/her how to talk to girls.  The main goal is to have sex with each of the (approx.) 6 characters.  The art style in the game is very much like those animes i mentioned above all the way down to the fan service/nudity.  All in all, the art is good. Voice acting isnt to bad either.\n\nThe Completionist:\nId say if you like to unlock things, the game has that in spades.  The game has artwork, items, steam trading cards, achievemnts etc., so theres much to unlock.  Additionally, the goal is to have sex with all the girls so you'll need to travel down every "path" to achieve that goal.  in total, it shouldnt take more then 5 or so hours to achieve this.  As a side note, for me, the draw here was getting to the final conversation of each girl.  Each girls final diolog was .... interesting, some better then others.\n\nThe Puzzle/Gem matching fan:\nThis isnt really my space, though i do find those games addicting while im playing them.  The challenge for me, is getting to the point where i would pick that style of game over others.  That aside, ive played a variety here and there, and this one (to me) doesnt really stand out over any other.  What was neat though was the "traits". Kind of like an RPG; you rank up traits with a specific currency that you earn by talking with the girls.  The traits help increase your points in the matching game which in tearn earns you another currency to purchase items.  You give the items to girls which increase the amount of that other currency that you get for talking to them that you invest into traits....  and around it goes.\n\nConclusion:\nAll in all HuniePop is a good game, though if you'e not an anime fan (specifically of the Ecchi genera), and not a Puzzle/Gem Matching gamer, id say stay away.  If you are either/or AND a completionist to boot then the game may just be up your alley.","December 12, 2015","true","18.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","100","4","4","4","0"

Art style is nice and while voice acting may not ALWAYS be the best, I find some of the girls even more endearing because of their voices (i.e. Beli, Tiffany). The music is also rather chill, easy to relax with. The game it's self is pretty standard fare for a puzzle game - simple but engaging.\n\nAs for the bad part, well the game can drag on a bit and make you want to take a break. As mentioned, the voice acting can get grating (don't know how many times i told Audrey to shut the hell up out loud). Thing that bothers me the most tho' is there really isn't much depth in character interactions and the game technically doesn't have an end. Just goes on forever with the difficultly ramping up as well.\n\nIn short, decent puzzle game with some cute girls and chill music. If you can handle silly adult content, I'd recommend it.","March 16","true","27.8"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Underneath all that sexual contents lie a relatively fun puzzle game. Think of it as Bejeweled, with sex. Basically all you need to do in this game is to match tokens. The more tokens you match, the better, as it will net you more score and, and sometimes a power up token, which if broken can net even more score. Some girls prefer different type of tokens, which will net you more score if matched, though they may dislike certain tokens, which if matched, won't make you lose your score, but you will get very little points for doing so. There are also penalty tokens, which will reduce your score if matched, and some power up tokens, which provide some bonuses to the tokens matched, or allows power ups to be used.\n\nOther than the puzzle aspect, there is the dating aspect, where you need to buy stuffs for whoever you are dating. Some girls like certain types of items, which will help you in terms on improving your traits. Some items, if given to certain girls, will net you a present in return. This present will contain an item which will help you in your dates (aka some power up used for the puzzle sections mentioned earlier). Some power ups are useful depending on your style of playing. Once you have dated all the girls, you may unlock another mode, where the difficulty keep on increasing. Basically the date never ends (three cheers for endless polygamy and dating behind the girls back).\n\nThere are many types of girls you can date. You can choose the girl net door, the Asian, the MILF, the cougar, the mega betch and so on. They have different personalities, but this does not really affect the gameplay aspects of this game. It's mostly on your preferences on who to date, though note that under certain circumstances you may unlock additional girls to date. Once you reached certain amount of..... love meter, you will get to sleep with them if your date at night is successful. This will consist of another puzzle game, albeit without the penalty tokens mentioned in the usual puzzle games. Keep breaking them and you will hear the girl moan a lot, once you filled up the meter, you will get to hear the girl reach her climax, and a CG image of the girl naked (or semi-naked). Yay.\n\nOverall, if you like puzzle games and massive fan services, you may enjoy this game. Just don't play this game in front of your parents or children. They may think you are some kind of a weirdo. I know I am one.","March 19","true","85.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Batgra/recommended/339800/","Batgra","Batgra","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Batgra/","165 products in account","So i wanted to pop in here (sad pun) and give my recommendation/review of this game. HuniePop (to me) feels targeted to thee different types of gamers who may enjoy the atmosphere and gameplay. The three types (as i would put it) are the Anime Fan, the Puzzle/Gem matching fan or the Completionist.  Any combination of two out of those three types will likely find something here to enjoy, though if you feel you only fit into one catagory or none; you may want to consider this game a pass.\n\nFor the Anime  Fan:\nMe personally, I am a fan of anime shows such as High School DxD, Rosario Vampire, Sekirei, etc. and as a fan i can say there are minor similarities between the plots of those shows and HuniePop.  Essentially, you are the perverted/awkward main character with sex on the brain thrust into a world where abnormal things are happening and you need to adapt.  HuniePop, nowhere near as extreme as the shows has the main character visited by a "fairy" who teaches you/him/her how to talk to girls.  The main goal is to have sex with each of the (approx.) 6 characters.  The art style in the game is very much like those animes i mentioned above all the way down to the fan service/nudity.  All in all, the art is good. Voice acting isnt to bad either.\n\nThe Completionist:\nId say if you like to unlock things, the game has that in spades.  The game has artwork, items, steam trading cards, achievemnts etc., so theres much to unlock.  Additionally, the goal is to have sex with all the girls so you'll need to travel down every "path" to achieve that goal.  in total, it shouldnt take more then 5 or so hours to achieve this.  As a side note, for me, the draw here was getting to the final conversation of each girl.  Each girls final diolog was .... interesting, some better then others.\n\nThe Puzzle/Gem matching fan:\nThis isnt really my space, though i do find those games addicting while im playing them.  The challenge for me, is getting to the point where i would pick that style of game over others.  That aside, ive played a variety here and there, and this one (to me) doesnt really stand out over any other.  What was neat though was the "traits". Kind of like an RPG; you rank up traits with a specific currency that you earn by talking with the girls.  The traits help increase your points in the matching game which in tearn earns you another currency to purchase items.  You give the items to girls which increase the amount of that other currency that you get for talking to them that you invest into traits....  and around it goes.\n\nConclusion:\nAll in all HuniePop is a good game, though if you'e not an anime fan (specifically of the Ecchi genera), and not a Puzzle/Gem Matching gamer, id say stay away.  If you are either/or AND a completionist to boot then the game may just be up your alley.","December 12, 2015","true","18.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","100","4","4","4","0"

The Review that will Doom My Credibility Forever.Genre: Tactical Match-3 Puzzle Anime Dating Sim\nDeveloped & Published by: Huniepot\nPlatform Support: Windows, Mac and Linux\nBusiness Model: Base Game\nCopy gifted by a friendRead the full and unabridged review on A Paladin Without A Crusade.[kingisaaclinksr.com]\n\nPreamble\nI started the series A Paladin’s Journey Through Steam earlier this year which was a series that features interesting new releases on Steam. One of the earliest and notable titles I ran across was Huniepop. A game that I wrote off quickly and cynically. To me, all I saw was another lazily made anime game designed for lonely nerds who just wanted boobies to look at. I even got some pretty amusing comments about it. (Though I’m quite bemused that a friend called this review. Curses.). However, I was linked to Jesse Cox’s look at the game in that thread and gave it a look. I figured that all I would lose is some time and maybe a few laughs at its expense. What I saw instead, surprised me. Not only did I notice that the game was not simply a cheap or poorly developed game, but a game with voice acting, narrative and in-depth mechanics. That took me aback and I knew then that I had to review it. Even if that meant I would eat some crow today.\n\nOverall Gameplay Thoughts\nHuniepop is a part dating sim and part match-three puzzle game. The dating sim part is where you’ll converse and interact with one of the eight women in the game. Each containing their own distinctive personality, preferences and voice actor. The match-three puzzle section is a board of affection blocks that you must match effectively in 20 turns. For the most part, Huniepop is focused on game mechanics than the story, expecting players to build their own narrative as the game goes on. Though granted the most narrative you’ll build is just how great/terrible you are with the ladies. There aren’t any men to date so if you’re into guys, well, this isn’t the game for you. It’s been awhile since I’ve done a review of a match-three game and it’s bemusing to me that it’s another genre-mixer that gets me interested in talking about it again. The combination of dating sim and match-three puzzles is weird and it does require you to accept that this is just how the game works. Even if it’s rather silly if you think about it. That said, the mixing works and gives the game a natural rhythm and pace that I quite enjoyed.\n\nMatch-3 Mechanics\nHow it essentially works is that you have to get to a certain level of affection with 20 turns/plays. You accomplish this by matching color blocks together and using date gifts at the right times. At first, the game is fairly forgiving of mistakes but as time goes on, you have to optimize each turn to gain the most amount of affection. The match-3 board has a few different twists from traditional games. First off, you’re able to move blocks around as far as you want in horizontal or vertical directions, giving you a little bit more flexibility in matching tiles together. Secondly, the game has date gifts (up to six available at any one time) which change how the board acts, give you additional turns, allow for scoring combos and much more. The date gifts give you several different ways to play in the puzzle sessions and it’ll be up to you to figure out winning combos. There’s a nice amount of variety with some combinations being risky while others safer though potentially can be screwed by the RNG. It creates a very tactical match-three experience that I really didn't expect. Each move can potentially be the difference between winning and losing.\n\nPC Settings and Audio/Visual\nHuniepop has a decent but still lacking settings menu. There’s fullscreen and windowed mode but with no resolution options. There’s a particle slider for when you complete matches in the puzzle game and that’s it for visual settings. Huniepop does have good audio control settings though. You can change the background music, sound effects and voice-over volume sliders. You can even use boops instead of the voice acting for when characters talk to you. Which is nice because lines are often repeated ad-nauseam and people can find this annoying rather quickly.\n\nThis is an anime game so of course it’s got the expected anime style. Which is very well done I should say. The women and background are well designed and consistent. Their faces can also display a variety of emotions and their lip flaps move well with the voice acting. The CGI-photo cards are just as impressive. The soundtrack is a laid-back, almost elevator style of various styles that will get old sooner rather than later. Probably about the same time as you’ll get tired of the repeated lines.\n\nFinal Thoughts\nWhile I had initially wrote off Huniepop as a lazy anime dating sim, I was pleasantly surprised to find that it was something more than that. Yes, it’s an anime dating game. Yes, it has all that you would expect from this genre (silly plot, sexuality, etc) and I’m clearly the demographic for it. It also doesn’t have any way of failing outside of achievement hunting. However, the mechanical depth that Huniepop is impressive. To the point that it has keeps what could have been a lazy boobs+match3 game and turns it into a title that’s genuinely enjoyable and amusing. It’s a dating game that isn’t just about being nice to every single woman you meet until they show up in your bedroom. You’ll have to get to know them and change your approach to win them over. Whether you choose to take it seriously or not, the match three portion is quite good as well, featuring some unique ideas and challenging, tactical gameplay to ensure that complacency will be punished. Overall, a well crafted dating sim and puzzle game worth considering, even if the sexual content doesn't interest you.\n\nRead this review and more on A Paladin Without A Crusade.[kingisaaclinksr.com]","July 25, 2015","true","18.8"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","2"

Reminiscent of a less restrictive form of the Persona series' Social Link game mechanic, you run around talking to 8 (+4 secret) girls in an attempt to take them home with you. You have 3 phases during each day that will dictate the style of date/location you will meet each girl, along with times when girls are unavailable. An overall success meter for each girl is presented and progressed through "dates" which occurs in the form of match 3 games. This switch from playing 20 questions is pretty refreshing and adds an addictive element to the game.\n\nI'm actually a bit surprised of the content Steam has allowed in the standard version. Most "adult" VN's in their censored form is usually neutered to a point beyond recognition of the original developer's intent. HuniePop managed to keep all of the mature dialogue and pictures.\n\n==== Issues ====The only major gripe I had with this game is that my cursor does not seem to properly align to the selections. I'll always have to shift left or right to select, open or close an item. Another minor greivance is that fullscreen options aren't available until after the tutorial is completed. I also definitely would've preferred better aspect ratio options (only two options given - no resolution numbers presented).\n\n==== Score ====Great\n- 9/10","May 15","true","3.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Match accordingly to the girl's most preferred traits and try to avoid her least preferred traits whenever possible. Make sure not to match the broken hearts!\n\nSounds: The voice acting is all right.\n\nMusic/Soundtrack: The music gets sort of repetitive over time.\n\nAddictiveness: It's pretty addictive if you are into match-three, Bejeweled or Candy Crush type of games and are into weird anime stuff.\n\nUser Interface: I'd say the user interface is pretty good for a dating simulator game like this. However, I had to run the game Windowed as opposed to my preferred Full-Screen No Border as for some reason the visuals in both left and right sides get messed up if I happen to force it to run full-screen no border.\n\nStory: It's about you dating more and more girls through the power of match-three and trying your best to not let them know you're cheating on them.\n\nGameplay: You just play the game as how you would play a match-three game, Bejeweled or Candy Crush, except it's sort of mixed with some Visual Novel gameplay. However, you are given date gifts and traits that are meant to help you out during the match-three gameplay.\n\nCharacters: The characters in HuniePop are somewhat an exaggerated version of realistic personalities. You have the cute, pure and short girl everyone likes. There's also the ♥♥♥♥♥y, hot and ♥♥♥♥♥♥-bag girl every guy likes. Then there's you, the perverted weeaboo who decided that you don't have the courage to ask a guy/girl out on a date in real life and decided to play this game.\n\nEnjoyment: ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)\n\nAt the time of posting this review, it is 26th of June 2015 and I have 10 hours played with a 66% progression on my save game. I will edit accordingly as I read feedback, put more time and progress further into the game.","June 26, 2015","true","13.7"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","1"

It very easily becomes a puzzle game that you don't just throw matches together because they're there and convenient, but you must think about every move you make to throw together the combos you need.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jamfrost/recommended/339800/","Jamfrost","Jamfrost Jamiro","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jamfrost/","623 products in account","Look, HuniePop is a satisfying match-3 game hidden inside a dating simulation with some uneven art assets, some likable characters, and hit-or-miss humor. It is nice that you can choose to be male or female, but in both cases, you will be seducing women. The dialogue will change to accommodate your gender. The game also comes censored, but that can be patched out with instructions in the game's Community Hub. I played the uncensored version with mixed results; I will go over the reasons later. If you are easily offended by nudity and vulgarity, you will do well to avoid this game and pick up Puzzle Quest instead for your match-3 fix. Please do not use this game as a guide to women in any capacity. You cannot match-3 your way into someone's heart or pants.\n\nThe match-3 gameplay is quite good and has a number of things that keep me coming back for more. You start off with only twenty moves to make the date a success. Every date's outcome is determined by your ability to match three or more tokens with each other, but not all tokens are the same. Each woman has a liked trait and a disliked trait that you will need to take into consideration. A woman that reacts well to Talent tokens and not as well to Seduction tokens creates a different focus on how tackle the puzzle in front of you. There are Talent, Flirtation, Romance, and Seduction.  Then there are four other tokens with very different effects: Joy, which adds a move; Sentiment, what you need to use items; Passion, which acts as a point multiplier; and Heartbreak, which detracts from your total score by a percentage. You will unlock images with successful dates which become more and more racy. When you take a lady that likes you enough on a night date, the two of you then engage in physical shenanigans. You can expect more match-3, but with a lot more moaning and a speed requirement that simulates reaching a climax. If you are bad at this section, expect to hear so much moaning that it turns into a case of semantic satiation, when you say a word over and over again until it loses all meaning temporarily.\n\nAfter you beat the sexual encounter match-3 segments, you will then be treated to the final and fourth image of that woman you took out. Here is where the mixed results complaint of mine appears with the uncensored version. Some of the representations of female anatomy are not accurate and give this surreal image of a woman's parts that are both there and not there. You will notice, assuming you are familiar with the female body, that some drawings fail to present all the necessary components of a proper ♥♥♥♥♥. It gives this odd feeling of privates that were grafted onto a Barbie doll, both incomplete and flat. I suppose women do not need to pee, ever. As a result, you will probably find the women much more arousing with their panties on which can be toggled.\n\nBut that's not all, I almost forgot to mention the items you can use on dates. They function as gifts that you give to the lady you are on a date on that cost Sentiment. You can have up to six items and they can have varying effects that range from consuming all of one token, increasing the frequency of a token's spawn rate, changing Heartbreak tokens into another type, and even granting extra moves which is what my build is centered around. One of my favorite combos is using the Stuffed Penguin, an item converts all Heartbreak tokens in Joy tokens, with Sunflower, an item that gives +1 move for each Joy token after the first two. You will be given random items for use as you give women regular gifts.\n\nThe dating experience tends to follow this pattern: talk to woman, learn about her, answer her questions, give her food so that you two can talk more, go on a date. Usually, they will not accept drinks until they like you enough. Drinks increase the Hunie multiplier and that is important because you use Hunie to increase your skills to keep up with the increasing difficulty. Also, your character turns out to be a piece of garbage liar that will do anything for sex if you want to engage with all the content. You can expect to date up to at least twelve ladies; three of them have special unlock conditions. Quite a few of them are materialistic and not likeable due to other things, the gift giving mechanic probably did not do those characters any favors. Beli and a few others have decent personalities. If you were looking for a legal cat-girl with the vocabulary of a child, this game has that for you.\n\nThe game also has jokes, sometimes about sex. Do you think ♥♥♥♥♥♥ are funny? Are you into collecting panties of women you have dated? Well... Hey, HuniePop has all that and a box of tissues. I am also constantly surprised at how all of these women have not gone into a diabetic coma with all the food I have been feeding them. I am sure she is doing just fine after those twelve pancakes and four corn dogs in one sitting.\n\nThis game hooked me with the match-3. I wouldn't have so many hours otherwise. I would not mind an endless mode where I could match tokens to my heart's content.","January 27, 2015","true","16.5"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

(and it worked a bit long for my taste)\n(Para os meus amigos Tugas (PT) têm um pequeno resumo no final.)\nI lack on english and is just me and my old pal the google translator, but I'll try not to make a mess of it.\nThis review is only a Bejeweled thing from a guy that just buy this for Bejeweled, everything else is only your imagination. (xD)\n\nPros:  - Simple and funny Bejeweled based game, but hard to master;\n- Achievements that push you to master it;\n- Funny characters with funny stereotypes (that will make you remember someone/thing) (and nice arts too);\n- A lot of gags;\n- Good history, where you can choose what to do, and who to date;\n- And you can use the lame lamest lamier, and also some kind true, excuse ever made: "I only play/buy this for Bejeweled;\n\nCons: - Very simple simulator (lack a bar that need to be fulfilled before you go on 	date, or some mode that you can do that for example);\n- A LOT of wasted potential;\n- Steam Cards can ruin the memory game part (Shame on Steam);\n- Lack of content after clearing the 1st time.\n\nHuniepop is very simple and fun game where you will date several girls pushed up by a pink hair, pervert love fairy, making fun with a lot of stereotypes and making you unconsciously prefer one girl to another. It has a good ambient music, that you barely notice, and you can play it without notice the hours passing by.\n\nThe game is very intuitive and some kind like the real thing, you need to know what type of person she is and what she like and have that in count, not only play things like you want (like screw the rules, I have money!). The broken hearts are like the part when you say/do something that she didn't like (and you are screwed) and of course the whole memory part (know her b-day, your first date, fav. color, etc.) (and thats like on real life can be cheat too, writing things on your memos xD, Very helpful indeed).\n\nThe history and the game have a huge potential but many of that wasn't used. For example a hard mode where your bad decisions and fail dates have consequences and can even lower your "hearts" with that girl depending how many hearts you have and how bad you were. It lack 3rd bar, a "go on date" bar, that need to be fulfilled with the question game (or with help of some gifts) for you unblock that day/night date to make the question game more worth it and interesting.\n\nThe promo artwork are good and I guess is some extra money for the company, but they can do better if they implant a group date, like who didn't go to see a movie with a few friends... is not the same as a "date", but it can be use in this game to (like the Halloween promo). They can put multiple bejeweled windows or multiple bars to be fulfilled in the date game and the "likeness" of the girls grow a extra bit, even with each others. At the end you receive an artwork (they can do other promos for dlc xD) and an achievement when you fulfill a few of those. This would be the best thing after complete the game once when all the girls liked you, of course it's just an idea but is still a good one since de game have almost no objective after that part...\n\nSaying that, it's still are a few things that I can't understand in the game, like how can a guy have 4 dates (or more) in a day, every day, without the other girls notice each others, knowing each others. That's hard, even for a pro. Doesn't needed to have a energy bar or something... Talking in pro... How can you go on date... AND RECEIVE MONEY?? That for a boy who date girls, not a gigolo who go with ladies. The inflation is other thing, 200 for an orange?? JEBUS!!! The last unique gift is almost 4000 or so, it ruin my hope to gift something like that to a girl, specially Nikki... who want an arcade machine from his boyfriend?? (well I can see some people doing it, but the point is...). Another thing that I didn't understand is why if you choose to be a girl you date other girls?? I don't know but I guess some girls will complain about it (but this is made for GUYS who like bejeweled, soo...).\n\nIn conclusion this is a very simple and fun game that I enjoy it, but still need to be worked on, especially after you complete every girl.\n\nLike I said I'm only talking about the Bejeweled and nothing else. If you read something that is not about that is just because you have a fertile imagination.\n\nScore 8.5/10\n---------------------------------------------------------//--------------------------------------------------------\n\nPara os meus amigos Tugas: ÉH PAH! Resumidamente o Huniepop é um jogo simples e muito divertido e facil de jogar, cheio de personagens caricatas que (e não existe outra forma de o dizer) as têm de levar para a cama. O jogo pede por mais, mas não está mau de todo. AH! E podem usar a desculpa mais esfarrapada que se inventou em toda a historia: "Comprei este jogo só mesmo para jogar Bejeweled!".","June 22, 2015","true","34.2"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","5","6","2","0"

However, that has since been fixed with help from friends, and the game now runs perfectly fine for me.\n\nPlot:\nHuniepop is a game based around the classic, Asian idea of a harem. You can play either a girl or boy, but it doesn't really seem to change the dynamics of the game much at all, and the goal is to have romantic relations with as many different women as possible, each with their own preferences, personalities, and weaknesses.\n\nGameplay:\nGameplay is a bit unique here. Instead of relying solely on linear dialogue options, Huniepop does things a bit different, by using a 'game within the game', which is a sort of sex version of Bejeweled, or Candy Crush. You mix 3 or more of the same color to get Passion, Sexuality, Talent, Extra Turns, and some few others, to raise the progress bar. If you manage to fill the progress bar to full before you run out of turns, you win, and gain a large amount of in-game money to buy presents for them with.\n\nDialogue:\nThe Dialogue is honestly not bad at all, and the English is properly written and pronounced. Although the dialogue itself is largely pointless except for when one of the girls asks you if you remember past facts that they've told you, it does help a bit with immersion, and is not the classic curse of dialogues: Pointless time stretching with no actual impact on the game.\n\nGraphics/Art Quality:\nBest that I've seen in a long time, although Sakura Spirit is really nicely done in my opinion, Huniepop has a bit of an edge over it because of...Well...The Explicit content! "What explicit content!?" is probably the question on your mind right now, since Steam does not permit blatant sexual themes in their games, and that's true, to an extent. There is a downloadable, safe, and small file that you can find online. Putting it into the Huniepop Steam directory will overwrite the censorship and let you play the game as it was intended: To masturbate furiously to.\n\nI...Can't really think of anything else to say about the game, since it is, in the end, just another anime harem game. If you want a game to play while you have a raging erection? Then this is the game for you.\n\nWant more games like this? Try these two:\n\nSakura Spirit\nNEKOPARA Vol.1","June 10, 2015","true","15.9"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","83","5","6","3","4"

If you're expecting any sort of actual story or character depth beyond basic personality elements, you should look somewhere else, because Hunie Pop has a lot more in common with Newgrounds dating sim flash games than quality dating VNs like Hatoful Boyfriend. Each of the girls has a set of 12 traits like their age, bra size, hobby, etc that you can ask them about, and they have a few shared questions that they'll ask you, and that's about the extent of your interaction (Nikki is still the best girl, though). You meet and greet them, and then you meat them, which is done through a match-3 game that's a lot more complicated and challenging than it has any right to be in this game. There are four basic types of gems representing different romantic attributes, and each girl has one type that they prefer (which gives a bonus for matching them) and one that they like less than the rest. There are also gems that increase your score multiplayer, gems that make you lose points if they get matched, gems that give you extra moves (you're limited in how many moves you can make before you fail the date), and gems that give you points that you can spend to use items obtained from giving the girls gifts, which do a wide variety of things. You can also increase the amount of dating points given from each type of gem by spending experience points gained from dates and talking to the girls. The difficulty ramps up surprisingly quickly, and it's actually surprisingly fun overall.\n\nThe dialogue is sometimes laughably awful, primarily from the main character's choices and Audrey (who is the worst girl, objectively) but the game seems to be self-aware of that and comes off as a so-bad-it's-kind-of-good thing, but you'll probably end up skipping through the voice acting or turning it off altogether by the time you're halfway in because of how little actual variety there is in the dialogue. The game is also censored, like most of the sexual VNs on Steam, but the developer has provided an uncensor patch that you can find pretty easily on the forums or guides if you want to see a few pictures of boobs. Overall I would recommend waiting for a sale, but it's not as bad as I thought it would be.","June 23, 2015","true","12.6"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","75","6","8","3","1"

Yes, it is a porno. Not a game with a lot gameplay whatsoever, because I would say that this porno does not have a lot of gameplay and has a very lame and boring story at that. The way you date is "meh" and I'll expand on that in a bit. Now, this porno is just a porno where you try to pick up chicks, have intercourse with them and then get their nudes. Yep, this porno is actually quitelike porno . I'm going to start off with the story of this porno because it actually does have quite a game story (that is bad tbh)\n\nit starts with... nothing , it doesnt even have a story , like all the pornoes.\n\n\nI only recomend you to play as a male cuz female is mayo free.\n\n\nNow, as I mentioned earlier you can date with girls. And this is where most of your gameplay comes from. You are introduced to a mini-game which is like a hunie-pop game. This is what I truly love about this game. Each girl has a different trait that she is into. Some may be into Flirtation whereas others may be into Talent. Each token on the board will represent a trait. Now, that may sound interesting but it actually isnt. If you click on a girls info or right click to bring up the HunieBee, you can stalk the girls. If you match more tokens of talent whilst a girl is into talent, it will give you more points. Whereas if you match tokens of flirtation when a girl isn't into that, she'll give you lesser points. I\n\nHunie can be obtained by just talking to a girl and giving her certain gifts. EZ\n\nAbout the art to this game; whilst the game may be very pornograpic, there's no point in denying that the art is really very will done and vibrant. yeah , as i said , its just porno.\n\nAchievements in this game : there is an achievement called "ayy lmao" 10/10 meme\n\nOverall, is this game good? Yes, it is. If you're a fan of  FNAF i mean porno and cute Anime (not really anime , they are western)babes.\n\nits a good "game".\n","December 25, 2015","true","12.5"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","6","8","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gamerrubrix/recommended/339800/","gamerrubrix","Gamer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gamerrubrix/","300 products in account","Gee, what to say about this... Alright, let's see.\n\nHuniePop is a Dating Sim game with Puzzle and RPG elements. You play as... Well, yourself (Male or Female) and go after several girls to date and ultimately get in the bed with to achieve total success. If you're playing as a female, the only thing that changes is the girl's seuxal orientation.\n\nThe game first starts by meeting a normal girl called Kyu, after awkwardly attempting to talk to her, she later appears in your room at night, now having fairy wings, and pink hair. Kyu says that she's a love fairy, and her job is to get people who can't date to... Be able to date. She does this by having you play a Bejewled/Candy Crush type game where you match 3 or more icons in a row. It'll win the girl's affection if you do well enough. After explaining, Kyu lets you roam the town, out looking for girls to date.\n\nNow, I normally don't like date sims as they're bland and boring, but this one is actually pretty in depth and has very likeable characters. All of the girls are very distinct and unique in their own way, and there's bound to be one you'll find as a favorite. There's even a few hidden girls with more unique traits. (Kyu herself as well.) It's not just dating either, there's management of your "Munie" and "Hunie", and the puzzle aspect. That'll be explained later.\n\n\nSo how the gameplay goes is you encounter one of the girls, talk to them, earn Hunie, and (Optionally) go on a date with them, where you play the puzzle game, and attempt to win their love. Each girl has 5 hearts, one heart earned for each successful date. Once you get to 4 hearts, you can get her to bed after the date, but only if the date is at night, and you succeed once you do another puzzle game in bed. Sounds simple? Not as much as you think. They won't talk to you, or date you if their appetite meter is empty, so buy food for them when that happens.\n\nYeah, I know what you're thinking, yes, there is nudity in this game, full voice acting, and the bedroom scenes have them moaning with each match you make in just their underwaer. Very revealing pictures of the girls after each successful date via text message and endgame screen. Panties stay on the whole time, unless you download a patch that makes the game completely uncensored. Go find it if you want it that badly.\n\nDates works like this: You play the puzzle matching game. You have a limited amount of moves, so you need to choose wisely on what you match. You need to get the required amount of points in order to make it a successful date. There are 4 kinds of trait tokens: Sexuality (Red), Romance (Orange), Talent (Blue), and Flirtation (Green). Each girl has their own preference on their favorite trait, and a least favorite. Obviously, some trait tokens will earn more points than the other, depending on the girl. There are also Passion Tokens (Hearts) which increase your multiplier, earning you more points for trait tokens. And there's also Joy tokens (Bells) which give you an extra move if matched. The only bad tokens are broken heart tokens (Purple Hearts) that make you lose points dramatically.\n\nSo, when you finally bring a girl home to have sex, you play another puzzle match. But this time, you have unlimited moves, no time limit, no Passion/Joy/Broke Heart tokens, and you have the meter decrease rapidly unless you keep matching to fill it all the way up until uh... Climax.\n\nNow for Munie and Hunie. Munie is only earned by completing a date (Failure or Win), and can be spent on gifts and various items to give to the girls. Hunie can be earned by talking to the girls, giving the right responses to them, and giving gifts that appeal to them, and you use that Hunie to upgrade your traits. Increasing your traits give you more points to that specific trait token. (Or you can increase your passion to have a higher multiplier, among other specific things.) You can also increase the amount of Hunie you earn by giving the girls "unique" gifts, increasing the Hunie you earn by talking and responding to them.\n\nThere is challenge in this game, namely in the puzzle area. Dates become harder and harder with each one you complete, and you need to keep your Hunie and Munie up to be sure you earn enough to have the right amount of upgrades. The achievements are a real kicker too, I think you'll find a good time with them.\n\nThis game also has a surprisingly long time too, probably around 20 hours if you wanna go for everything, that's a shocker.\n\nSo overall, HuniePop is a surprisingly great game with cute girls and fun puzzle solving. For all the reasons I said above, it's worth more than $10.","February 27, 2015","true","20.4"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","9","14","0","2"

With me not being a big fan of match-3 games, this one actually hooked me in.\n\nThe mechanics of how certain orbs/tokens affect the meter. multiplier system, sentiment system and the gifts, were really a good surprise at how well it meshed together to make it into a pretty fun and somewhat challenging game. The RPG/Dating Sim elements are also pretty well done and contributed positively to the overall gaming experience. The unlockable customization options are also a big boon, since I didn't really like some initial character designs, I was able to go around that with the customization for the characters.\n\nThe art is well drawn, clean, colorful and vibrant all around. Lots of cute going on around.\n\nThe characters are surprisingly well written. At first I thought they were pretty bland and one dimensional; covering all the generic tropes, but as I got on further into the game, found surprising nuances in their characters.\n\nThe sound design is what you would expect of a match 3, so I'll end that there. What really got to me were the voice acting and the BGMs. The Voices are pretty well done with some iffy stuff here and there, but overall good and mostly matched what the characters are. The BGMs, I found myself wanting the soundtrack for it.\n\nMy few gripes of it would probably be the tutorial and some menu/interface elements. The tutorial left me with a few questions left unanswered like which Token is which attribute. The lack of an save and exit option left me clueless as to how to go about ending my session (which also led me to unlock everything up to the 10th girl in one sitting. Maybe that's what the devs actually wanted to happen, you sly dogs). An indicator to which gift I've already given to the current girl in the shop would have been also nice; I found myself switching back and forth between the profile and shop menus constantly.\n\nAll in all, it was a pretty good experience and I would recommend this game to select people, since the theme isn't exactly what would be considered normal.\n\nIf I would give it an arbitrary score, it would be an 8/10","January 27, 2015","true","14.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

There are some reviews/coverage out there that paints this game as being an insult to women, but I didn't entirely see this. I suppose that to a point I could see where some are coming from with that, but any sexism was definitely not intended.\n\nYour enjoyment of this game will ultimately boil down to how much you like games like Bejeweled since that's really the main thrust of the game (no pun intended). The dating sim aspects are somewhat weak and mostly there to string together the various game levels for each girl and give you power ups. The story is probably the weakest part of the game and probably why the charges of sexism are even being levied, since there really isn't a lot to these women other than their datability. While yes, this is an aspect of datings sims to a degree, the good dating sims give you a chance to become at least slightly emotionally invested in the characters. I didn't really get that feeling with this game's characters- not even the person we're supposed to be portraying.\n\nSome of this I can handwave away by this being a "first game" that was funded via Kickstarter. The learning process is always a rough one and for this to be the developer's first official game and sorta dating sim (that I'm aware of) it's a pretty darn good one since there are no visible glitches or errors that interrupt gameplay. I'm aware that there wll be a second game and I hope that the developer brings in more character development since that was something that was sorely missing with this game. The dating sim aspect was no risk and while I didn't entirely mind that, I did want to see more interaction with the characters and more development. This game had a lot of potential and while it lives up to that on the matching game end, it was sorely lacking on the dating sim angle. I think that more character development, the ability to have some slight risk (like being caught with another girl means that you can't date one or both girls for a set period of time), and the ability to choose a Final Girl would have improved this greatly and would be great to have in the sequel.\n\nUltimately I'd recommend this, but not to anyone looking for a more involved dating sim or one with any true storyline.","March 30, 2015","true","34.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Well lets start with the obvious, puzzles and porn, two things that never in a million years would I have thought that they could be mixed together but this dev did it, and quite successfully too. Huniepop delivers on what they advertised on steam, and along with the devs generously providing the means to get the uncensored version of the game, I would say it is worth the money and time.\n\nThis game does have a few weaknesses though, especially for those whom have never played a puzzle game before, or don't find puzzles to be very compelling. (like me).\n\nThe game's tutorial is rather light on teaching a new player on how to effectively match the pieces, to say nothing of teaching how to pull off a "multiple combo" in which a player can clear a good portion of the board at once, for me its still seems like random luck despite playing it for 12 hours. A tutorial that details that aspect of getting the most out of your moves would be welcomed. Easy mode could also be more "easy", don't underestimate my utter lack of skill when it comes to puzzles.\n\nAnother issue is the lack of interaction choices with the various women in the game, its the same three questions, (And same greetings) despite the fact you have asked (Or met) them before. They certainly do not change based on their relationship with the player either. And while yes this game is not meant to be a serious dating sim,(More on this later) a small amount of effort put here by the devs would be welcome.\n\nNow as for the "plot". I will say right now that I have not completed the game, nor have I unlocked all the characters, so I could very well be missing something very big. That being said what I have seen so far passes off as bare minimal at best, and that surprisingly is a good thing, since this game seems more like a spoof on the dating sim genre and plays on some of the various tropes, and sterotypes quite well, and seems to poke fun at itself too.\n\nThose of you looking for a more serious dating sim would do well too look elsewhere.\n\nNow for what everyone has been waiting for.... the "pictures" are done very well, (could stand to have more for each character though, but thats just my personal gripe.) The voice actresses are also surprisingly good as well.\n\nWell I think that everything that needs to be said about this game, its good for what it does, its not a bad game by any means but at least for me, the one who sucks at puzzles, I don't know if the promise of new characters, more nude pictures, and possible plot is enough to persuade me to continue "grinding" through increasingly difficult puzzles for a set of three to four pics, even if they are well done. Though I am sure I will attempt to progress from time to time.","January 27, 2015","true","59.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I'm just going to add that the mechanics in this game are surprisingly refreshing in comparison to a lot of other Match 3 games out there. Though this may partly be because of the dating sim aspect/element that's tied to it, which is nice if you're into that and/or a bit of 'nostalgia' if you played any of those back in the day.\n\nThe game is fully voice acted which is really great and if you ask me has better voice acting than a lot of games who share the same price range/budget. Though as is with these sim games; once you get through all the dialogue, the charm may quickly wear off for some, voice acting or not. You can turn it off if you're just playing for the 'puzzles' or whatnot but that would be silly.\n\nIf you absolutely can't stand games with an 'anime' appeal, you shouldn't even be reading this let alone consider playing the game. If you're a 'Match 3' fan and not too shy of a potential and probable nosebleed, it's worth a try. If you're a total anime dork with a high level of lewdness, this is probably as close as you can get on Steam.. perhaps even too far if you know where to look, but I'll leave it at that.","April 25, 2015","true","32.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Well regardless of how you discover it, it's either you're sold on the girls gameplay or you move on....Oh who am I kidding, it's either you love it, or you love it.\n\nGameplayThis game is essentially two in one; Bejewelled and a Dating Sim. Your goal is to get laid...multiple times. In fact, you're supposed to get laid with ALL the girls and collect their panties. I've gotta say, I've never been more concentrated in my life. You'd think that a game that appeals to our primal nature would be a walk in the park? Heh. This game tests your memory as well as your bejewelled tactics with a tad bit of luck sprinkled in for good measure. I can't even tell you how many times I was 1 move away from getting the girl; sink or swim. Most of the time I'd fail and go lie down and curl up in my bed trying not to cry. However on those epic moments where I made the right moves, I'd excitedly punch a wall knowing what I was to experience. But no, the struggle wouldn't end there. No no, from start to finish, it would be a fast paced match-3/4/5 minigame as you watch with childish excitement as clothes came off calmly watch a woman's chest become exposed and her make some unique sounds.\n\nThe game was easy to get into, but was actually challenging in many respects. But let's be real here, who's gonna boast about getting all the achievements in HuniePop amirite? Don't judge me :(\n\nVisualsThe cartoony visuals were just fine for this type of game. The most appealing parts were of course....well you know.\n\nAudioThe music was fairly good, though at times it could get almost repetitive but at least it was good enough to listen to.\nThe voice actors for each of the ladies did their parts pretty damn well, though some of their moans were a bit weird lol.\n\nSummaryYou're either gonna love this game for the girls or you're not going to be interested. The bejewelled style of gameplay and the dating sim aspect are both not unique but done well enough to keep you interested. This will appeal to some people, but not all, and your reasons for playing this will vary.\n\nIf you like these types of games then:\n\n8/10 worth a buy sex sells amirite?\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

I bought this game as I heard about it from Kotaku and from the general internet so I decided to buy on a 50% off sale. This game is a hybrid genre being a date sim/puzzle game and is definitely a good mix. The story without telling too much is Kyu, who is a fairy wants to help you get a girlfriend and to do this she get you to talk to women and you are off. The day is split into four parts morning, midday, evening and night where you can visit whichever women you want in each of these four parts of the day.\n\nWhen dating women you are required to play a bejeweled type of game where you match colours (with consideration to the women’s colour preferences). On the fourth night the women sends you a lewd picture of herself to you and once a 5th date is reached at night then you get to enter the bedroom scene where the explicit content mainly occurs which can be dependent of whether you choose to download the uncensored patch or not https://steamcommunity.com/app/339800/discussions/0/616198900649668367/\n\nPositives\n-Addictiveness\n-Replayability\n-The animation style\n-Animation quality and detail\n-Sexually arousing\n-Great background artwork\n-Amazing gameplay\n-A decent amount to do (if you are a completionist)\n-Official censorship removal patch\n-Wonderful background music\n-Wonderful replacement for real life women :)\n-Not to easy and not to hard (until Alpha mode XD)\n-Voice acting (I’m a weeaboo and love Japanese voices for most things with animated visuals however I love Huniepop’s voice actors even in English :)\n\nNegatives\n-Not enough characters (even though there is 12 characters and this is a minor complaint)\n-Bedroom scene is sometimes a bit too difficult for some people (however there is a mod to fix this difficulty issue)\n\nConclusion\nThis game to me was definitely worth the money and I even bought my friend this game as well. I recommend it to all who love anime/animated visuals, people who are weeaboos, males or bi-women and have an appretiation for lewd games, why, because of the plot :)","March 11","true","37.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Hyperfludd/recommended/339800/","Hyperfludd","Hyperfludd","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Hyperfludd/","281 products in account","This is a bit of a weird game. I wouldn't really call it a visual novel..at all. So I think having that in the description is a little misleading. So if that's the kind of thing you're looking for, look elsewhere for sure. The closest to that you'd get are the (wonderfully hilarious) character introductions in the game - which last all about ten minutes or so. Looking past that little issue however lies a somewhat addicting match 3 puzzle game with dating elements and of course, lewd imagery.\n\nThe dating sim portion of the game comes into play with getting information out of the girls, learning things about them and using that knowledge to answer their questions correctly to earn Hunnie (what this game calls it's EXP) - which you use to improve 8 stats which effect your play in the puzzle portions of the game. All the characters and lines are fully voiced and performed well, so trying to get all the info isn't too much of a boring chore until you start running into repeat questions. You can give each girl gifts to upgrade their Hunnie/EXP multiplier, as well as get hair styles to customize them with. You earn outfits as well, so if you're into collecting and playing dress - that's for you.\n\nThe actual dates and what I'd call the meat of the game are the match 3 puzzles. They invoke a little bit of Puzzle Quest, minus actively fighting an enemy. You're instead trying to reach a total point count with a numbered set of moves - making every match you make count. It's the first time I've played a match 3 in this way and I really enjoy planning moves ahead to make the use of matches. You can also equip items for use mid-date to alter the board or use one time abilities. This way it becomes a little bit more than your average match 3 game and it got a little addicting for me personally - a good thing for a basic puzzler to have.\n\nIt's a shame the dating sim portions are light while the VN elements evaporate in the first 7 minutes - having more around this puzzley core would make this game much better. Regardless, the way those puzzles made me think led to me honestly enjoying my time with the game.\n\n..But hey, the art and CG in the game is pretty good. I know you're looking for that too!","January 25, 2015","true","15.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I'm just going to add that the mechanics in this game are surprisingly refreshing in comparison to a lot of other Match 3 games out there. Though this may partly be because of the dating sim aspect/element that's tied to it, which is nice if you're into that and/or a bit of 'nostalgia' if you played any of those back in the day.\n\nThe game is fully voice acted which is really great and if you ask me has better voice acting than a lot of games who share the same price range/budget. Though as is with these sim games; once you get through all the dialogue, the charm may quickly wear off for some, voice acting or not. You can turn it off if you're just playing for the 'puzzles' or whatnot but that would be silly.\n\nIf you absolutely can't stand games with an 'anime' appeal, you shouldn't even be reading this let alone consider playing the game. If you're a 'Match 3' fan and not too shy of a potential and probable nosebleed, it's worth a try. If you're a total anime dork with a high level of lewdness, this is probably as close as you can get on Steam.. perhaps even too far if you know where to look, but I'll leave it at that.","April 25, 2015","true","32.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The writing looked awful from the infamous mall scene with Audrey and Kyanna. The gameplay looked pretty boring.\n\nI was legitimately impressed by this game. It takes the classic bejewled style puzzle gameplay and tweaks it just enough that it  feels fresh. The sentiment and passion mechanic makes you plan your moves out ahead. On higher difficulties, you'll fail quite a bit if you're not precise.\n\nThere's a waifu for everyone in this game. A small touch, you can play as either a male or female and there's no difference outside of the pronouns used in dialogue and a few changed lines.  It's not  a huge deal, but I really appreciated that there wasn't any pandering to either gender.\n\nThe OST is pretty catchy. You'll be humming some of the tracks for days to come.\n\nOh, and there's a huge amount of time you can sink into the game. Replaying will get you 100 percent completion and new achievements, and there's an infinite time attack mode for masochists.\n\nI highly recommend this game.","April 27, 2015","true","84.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rottmer/recommended/339800/","rottmer","Rottmer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rottmer/","197 products in account","Its a puzzle game that teaches you how to bang girls if they were as one dimensional as possible. Or, I guess, two dimensional?\n\nIts not really that bad. The gameplay consists of talking to girls, finding out what they like, their age, etc for "hunie", which lets you buy upgrades to make the dating portions of the game easier. The dating part is basically Bejeweled, or maybe a watered down Puzzle and Dragon's if you are familiar with that. Some girls like orb matches better than others, and thus you gain more points for those matches. Every date requires you to earn a specified amount of points that increase the more dates you do. It can be fairly challenging at times.\n\nEvery now and again, you get nice little rewards in the form of photos from girls. You can probably guess what they are. Very risqué!\n\nOne of the real gems in this game, for me, was the off-color humor, especially from characters like Kyu. The game is pretty self aware, as are some of the characters (like Aiko, for example). It got me a few laughs here and there, and some of the girls reactions to when you screw certain things up is pretty funny and cute. I'm not sure I'd pay full price for this (thank god for sales, huh?) but if I did, I don't think I would feel cheated.\n\nDevs put up a link to the uncensor patch on the discussion forms, so if you really wanna see the nudity that pops up after your fifth date, its just a drag & drop. OR just go on sad panda; pretty sure its there too.","December 27, 2015","true","6.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The voice acting is great and really brings the game alive, and the puzzle mechanics are deep enough to pose a challenge but never become impossible.\n\nThe only problem I have with this game, is that there is no “ending” to the story. I’ve slept with all the girls, including Kyo and Venus, but the game simply continues.\n\nP.S: I uploaded a 'cheat sheet' with all the girl's details (except for Kyu and Venus, since when you get to them, you've probably fully upgraded your talents) to Gamefaqs.

I believe in what these girl's saying, and that's always is a good thing.\nSecond would be writing, it's a smart writing, and also believeable. I mean, these kind of girls can exist (they rare, but exist).\nFor some one it could be puzzle part. It's a bit challenging (or it could be just me XD).\nFor me, the flaws of the game is lack of story, it could be a bit more of it, and not just begining (cuz most of the point in this game is just draging girls in bed). And also, someone could put in minuses the thing that the game is in anime style (not for me).\nOh, and also boobs and fan service. LOTS OF IT. Especially if you install uncesored patch ;)\nIn conclusion:\n\n+ :\n- Good voice acting\n- Neat writing\n- Good puzzle mechanics (and for someone even challenging)\n\n- :\n- Lack of story\n\nOptional -/+\n- Fan service and boobs\n- Anime style","January 24, 2015","true","9.6"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

The game does a really nice job of immersing the player into the world of HuniePop from the moment you start the game up. In addition to that, it really teaches the player a nice life lesson that is essential in our modern day society. The game really emphasizes the power and significance of communication with your peers, but makes sure to teach the lesson in a fun and memorable way. It even concentrates on the importance of building friendships, and perfectly captures how friendships work in the real world. I believe that this is the best game I've ever played in my life.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MissSashi/recommended/339800/","MissSashi","amy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MissSashi/","90 products in account","This may be the weirdest game I have ever played, and this is coming from a fan of Hatoful Boyfriend. It's such a mix of well-done elements and absolute cluelessness that it makes for a bizarre and fascinating train wreck. I was compelled to play on so I could see just how bad it was. But save your time and money, I'm happy to share my findings.\n\nPros:\n- Voice acting. It's not amazingly good, but it is an advantage that many visual novels/dating sims/eroge in English don't have.\n- Cute art of the various characters. This game honestly may have the best art of any pretty-girl game on the app store. I even liked the images of the extremely odd-looking hidden character [spoiler redacted.]\n\nCons:\n- It's racist. Really racist. You must buy stereotypical Mexican items like sombreros for the Latina, traditional Japanese items for the Japanese woman, and the Middle Eastern woman wears the kind of Arabian Nights harem outfit you'd find at a (racist) costume store. The Japanese woman will call you a "!@#$ing racist" for giving her this crap, but still accepts and appreciates these gifts somehow. At least the black woman gets airline memorabilia, that's something... :/ You never get a chance to ask any of these women what country they are actually from or whether they are an American. By the way, your fairy guide will describe these women in terms like "brown sugar" and "yellow fever". I guess it's supposed to be less racist because... it's meant as humor? She's a girl? I dunno.\n- How to describe the Sisyphean despair that is the economy of HuniePop? You may only like one or two of the 9-12 women in the game. (I liked a grand total of two, it would've been three if the cute fairy weren't also a racist idiot.) But in order to buy your girlfriend presents, you must go on dates with other women, which earns you cash ("Munie".) Besides, what else are you going to do? In the world of HuniePop, there is NOTHING BUT DATING AND SEX. No hobbies, no real conversations, no joy.\n- Laughably outdated dating sim conventions: you buy the right present for the female to level up in romance. Getting a woman's last name or favorite color right will repeatedly level up your love skills. You stud, you.\n- Mechanics that make no sense. Dates are successfully completed by getting a certain number of points. If you get two points shy from 17,000, even though she has been laughing and complimenting you the whole time, your date suddenly freaks out and often makes fun of you. Then you get money and can ask them out again and again! They never say no, unless they're hungry. Then you give them a bagel or something first.\n- Match-3 bubble popping. So, so many bubbles. While "date gifts" can be used for various advantages, it's always the same mini-game.\n- You must have all the sex to complete the game in any semi-meaningful way (you get a tiny cutscene with the nymphomaniac fairy saying "Good job!", an achievement, and access to the final game content.) Every single woman in the game, no exceptions. Don't want to sleep with a woman and her daughter? To constantly lie to different women about whether you're only seeing them, or to assure two that you agree with different stuff? Are you not attracted to a character who talks like a little girl, or the [redacted] with the ridiculous breasts and the weird-looking face? TOO BAD. Get with them or GTFO.\n- And what is the sex? Is it at least sexy? NOPE! More bubble-popping! Match 'em for dear life, because unless you quickly and accurately attain the mysterious achievement that is the female ♥♥♥♥♥♥ via mini-game, not only will you not get a sexy graphic or any other reward, you are STUCK THERE FOREVER. You can't take a woman home, play the mini-game for an hour, fail, and say "I'm not feeling it, honey." There are also no save files, so, good luck with that, sucker!","June 10, 2015","false","17.6"," 44 of 84 people (52%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","52","44","84","6","5"

Dysfunction in these circuits leads to characteristic biological, psychological, social and spiritual manifestations. This is reflected in an individual pathologically pursuing reward and/or relief by substance use and other behaviors.\n\nAddiction is characterized by inability to consistently abstain, impairment in behavioral control, craving, diminished recognition of significant problems with one’s behaviors and interpersonal relationships, and a dysfunctional emotional response. Like other chronic diseases, addiction often involves cycles of relapse and remission.

They are usually quite stupid, with vapid characters and uninteresting dialogue. And no voice acting to speak of.\n\nBut this game. Holy sweet mother♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥ did it impress me. I first saw it in JesseCox's FanFriday video on youtube. Check it out.\n\nThis game doesn't have pretty faces that say nothing interesting. The women in this game have hilarious, entertaining, and adult dialogue. There isn't too much dialogue (mostly answer and question format) but the stuff that is there is very enjoyable.\nAnd the voice acting is quite amazing. Every line I've heard so far has successfully coveyed what the speaker wanted to say. When these ladies want to sound sexy, they sound sexy.\n\nThe gameplay has its own little re-skin on the Bejeweled style play, and for someone who has never played a Bejewel-esque game it is pretty entertaining.\n\nNow to what is most important next to the dialogue and voice acting: The art. The girls look great, the artstyle conveys a kind of perfection in the models that I haven't seem much of at all. Each image you can unlock (so far) is interesting and unique. And, importantly, hot in its own way.\n\nIn short, the game does 'adult' sexy very well, which is certainly a major draw for this game. I would certainly look into buying more products from this developer!\n\n\nP.S. : Yes, the mechanics used in dating here do not convey to real life. That does not diminish the enjoyment found in this game.\n","January 25, 2015","true","22.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

This game is awesome and the voice acting is done exceptionally well. The only thing I didnt like is that it didnt support 1920 * 1080. But the game scales well at least.

And, at its core, that's pretty much what it is. But if you take a chance and really play it through to the later levels, the game gets hard. Brutally hard. But in a good way. I was never much of a Bejewled fan, but the puzzles on this game are near brilliant in design. They really make the player think about each and every move they make, from the beginning of the date to the end.\n\nThe dialogue in the game isn't terrible either. Sure, it can be cringe-worthy or downright bad in spots - but the voice acting is very well done, for the most part. The women you can date are pretty much paper thin in personality, but I think that was probably  done on purpose. Overall, outside of the puzzle aspects of the game, the "dating sim" part of it ain't half bad either.\n\nOverall, most people would probably think of others as silly or perverted for buying a game like this. Did I buy this for the boobs? You bet I did. But I kept playing because the game was actually very well made, and very addicting. Lewd scenes and pictures aside, this game holds its own very well as a puzzle/dating sim, and I can't recommend it more.","May 9, 2015","true","32.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

The dialogue is witty and raw, the girls are sexy and the very slow-paced gameplay is both relaxing and rewarding.\n\nThis game is explicity for adults, featuring heavy sexual themes and strong language.\n\nStory\nYou wake up early one morning, ambushed by a mysterious woman you'll know as Kyu, the Love Fairy. Being the sexually-awkward teenager that is the main character, your only response options to the sight of a pretty lady are "HI!! HELLO!!" and "Uhhhhh...". Classy.\n\nKyu becomes your love mentor as she drags you along different locations to meet some girls. She's extremely rude, urging, swears constantly and is very casual about talking about sex, leading to some great dialogue against the awkward main character. It's a hysterical adventure as you meet girls with wildly different personalities and authentic-feeling reactions to dialogue options.\n\nAt the end of the day, it's a Dating sim. You know what the story's main plot is: having sex with everyone. Still, the game has amazing writing that makes the adventure and the characters believable and likeable.\n\nGameplay\nHuniepop mixes a variety of gameplay modes in ways to give the player as much choice as possible as he progresses through the game. The game is structured around a day-night cycle with calendar timeline, visual novel-esque sequences and a puzzle game which acts as Dating. The puzzles are the main meat of the game and are more than traditional Match 3 games.\n\nThe puzzles have no time restraints and reward patience and careful planning, limited rather by the number of moves you can make before the girl gets bored on the date and leaves. After all, when you're with a woman you need to take the time to do it right. The Dating parts of the game are where you'll spend the most of your time, using what you've learned about the girls, boosters and upgrades earned by giving them gifts or just talking to them in order to solve the puzzle and impress the girls on their date.\n\nWhen a girl likes you enough (having impressed her on multiple dates), she'll ask for a place to stay for the night. Oh, yeah.\n\nAudio\nThe audio is brilliant. There is not a single line of dialogue that doesn't have full, high-quality english VO. The characters sound as authentic as you'd want them to and it's clear that a lot of direction was put into this aspect of the game. The music features a pleasant mix of instrumental pop, upbeat elevator music and (of course) a touch of sexy, slow jazz.\n\nTechnical\nNothing negative to report. Sufficient options, no bugs encountered during my playthroughs and everything worked nice.\n\nThe TL;DR\nThe girls are sexy and tasteful, the dialogue is raw and the gameplay is solid. Huniepop is an unexpectedly intricate, deep-rooted hybrid of both the Dating sim and Puzzle aspects, ensuring that progression in one aspect of the game directly affects the other and, with time-passing consequences to failing dates, encourages the player to learn about the girls as much as possible, carefully plan moves and pick the right time for everything.\n\nAll of my previous clients are basically walking babe magnets now. You though... Let's just say, you will be my greatest accomplishment yet.","December 26, 2015","true","152.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","2","2","2","0"

I wondered if the puzzle aspect would be too simple and the game would just be eye candy. If you like manga anime girls. Who doesn't really?\nThe puzzle aspect of it is fun. I'm hooked. It's not just a dating sim, there is some strategy to completing the puzzles in a limited amount of turns.\nI'm a huge fan of the old Bubble Bobble series and Puzzle Quests. If you like those kinds of games with definitely some strong sexual themes and language. You will probably enjoy it as well.\n\nOnly negative I guess would be, the dialog for the dates is not very big. So they tend to ask the same questions over and over. That can be fixed with a mouse click to skip their dialog though.\n\nThere are collectibles and unlockables, secret characters. Just a fun game to kill some time.

This is a dating... game... thingy... soft-porn-y stuff, whose unwriten goal is to sleep once with every girl in town, to unlock a special girl. After sleeping with her and the two secret characters, you unlock the "Alpha Mode" that never ends. Of course you are guided by a magical pink kinky fairy girl who collects sex toys.\n\nTrue enough, the game is full of soft core stuff, but that is not what makes this game so great. I think it is pretty much impossible to play it through and not like at least one girl (or one catgirl <3). The characters are very well designed, the art is VERY good and the voice acting is great - do not be surprised if you find yourself getting attached to one girl and neglecting your "playa" goal.\n\nThe achievements are right on spot. They are fun, they are challenging "just enough" and I guess anyone with a figment of determination can get all of them. Or freaks may want to take it to another level and get all of them in one single run (yeps, me). Regardless of your strategy, this game has a lot of replayability value... if you know... what I mean...\n\nNow excuse me, since I've got all achievements already I will be... playing Bejeweled on and on and on with a certain catgirl.","January 24","true","39.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Eventually you go out into the town to hook up with the ladies.\n\nNot all the ladies are the same since each person has their prefered likes and dislikes, not only that they will be constantly asking questions ranging from "how good are you with money" to remembering their cup size, yes that is actually a thing. You have 2 kinds of currency in the game, cash for buying gifts, food and drinks, and Munny for buying traits to help you out in your dates.\n\nWhen it comes to dating is when the puzzle aspects kick in, you have 4 main tokens to build the goal gauge including sentiment tokens to use in-game items to help, passion tokens to increase how quick the goal gauge will fill up, and heart break token, simply put avoid matching them. Weather or not you complete the date you will earn cash and simply talking and giving gifts will earn you Munny.\n\nAs you complete dates the ladies will send pictures of themself to you and on the last possible date with them "at night" you have a chance to bring them back to your place and, well i think your minds can finish the rest.\n\nThere are a total of 12 ladies to go out with and 3 difficulty levels to choose from and once you beat the game theres the option to do "Alpha Mode" which continues to rank up the difficulty.\n\nAll in all in my mind its "Come for the ladies, Stay for the puzzles"\nI give this game 8 outta 10 Pops","May 15, 2015","true","15.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

You can slide a gem across the entire column or row to make a match, moving each piece you drag it across too.  This allows for thoughtful combos.  You also unlock special moves that do various things to the board that you can use to build a unique strategy.  The puzzles never really feel unfair;  The game never really feels cheap like some other games do (puzzle quest, anyone?)\n\nWhile date puzzles give you 20 turns to fill the score, the sex puzzles require you to match gems to fill a depleting meter.  This makes the sex puzzles a change of pace from the careful strategy of the date puzzles to a twitchy match-them-quickly type of play.  It's a different type of challenge entirely and it's great.\n\nThe RPG element of leveling up your stats for the puzzles adds a growth element that allows you to overcome the increasing difficulty of the puzzles.  You can raise your stats in any order as well.\n\nI liked the dialogue.  Some people hate it, but I thought it was good.\n\nIt has a pretty basic story that I won't get into but it is serviceable to what's going on in the game.  Everything seems to make sense and I guess that means that it's good.\n\nOverall, I'd say the game is worth playing if you're into puzzle games and don't hate the idea of dating women in a video game.","July 31, 2015","true","13.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

The first thing that struck me about this game was the quality of the voice acting. The voice acting alone is enough to warm the depths of your heart (among other things).\n\nThe way characters are introduced is a smooth, albeit smei-forced process, where each character will tie into a new one, etc.\n\nThe actualy gameplay aspect of it? It's Q&A + Bejewelled that leads to snoo-snoo.

Oh, well, I suppose it must be done. Although it is very much a dating sim, that dosen't detract from it being an interesting iteration on the match-three or "Bejeweled" system. The move-capped "date grid" system is certainly an interesting mechanic, and forces the player to think about their next move, instead of just making moves as fast as possible. The added motivation of the end result (which you can probably figure out on your own) dosen't hurt either. You can essentially think of HuniePop in one of two ways: an interesting puzzle-RPG with occasional questionable artwork as a reward, or a dating sim/visual novel where your access to CGI photos of naked anime girls is blocked by match-three puzzles. In either case, I would recommend this game to puzzle game and pornography enthusiasts alike. There you go. A straight-face review of HuniePop. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have some... "puzzles" that require my attention.","May 17, 2015","true","144.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","2","2","2","1"

This makes the sex puzzles a change of pace from the careful strategy of the date puzzles to a twitchy match-them-quickly type of play.  It's a different type of challenge entirely and it's great.\n\nThe RPG element of leveling up your stats for the puzzles adds a growth element that allows you to overcome the increasing difficulty of the puzzles.  You can raise your stats in any order as well.\n\nI liked the dialogue.  Some people hate it, but I thought it was good.\n\nIt has a pretty basic story that I won't get into but it is serviceable to what's going on in the game.  Everything seems to make sense and I guess that means that it's good.\n\nOverall, I'd say the game is worth playing if you're into puzzle games and don't hate the idea of dating women in a video game.","July 31, 2015","true","13.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

To top it off, the voice acting is very well done (realistic throes of passion), the art is very polished, and there are some pretty entertaining jokes in here.\n\nMy only huge con for this game is some of the jokes get borderline offensive, but since the game goes off the deep end into ridiculousness quite often, I can't take it too seriously.\n\nEnjoy the naked ladies!","August 7, 2015","true","34.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","2"

Smut. Let's just get that out of the way. Good.\n\nHuniePop is actually really, REALLY fun. The characters in it feel like actualy people, not just waifu-fodder. The first thing that struck me about this game was the quality of the voice acting. The voice acting alone is enough to warm the depths of your heart (among other things).\n\nThe way characters are introduced is a smooth, albeit smei-forced process, where each character will tie into a new one, etc.\n\nThe actualy gameplay aspect of it? It's Q&A + Bejewelled that leads to snoo-snoo. What's not to like?\n\nBoobs and smut aside, this is a truly fun experience, and I don't regret buying it one little bit.","August 5, 2015","true","8.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
