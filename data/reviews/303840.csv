There aren't really any hidden depths; it's a game where you click and drag to kill things while avoiding actual contact with them. What you see is what you get. Even for $5, it just doesn't seem as interesting as other free games I've played. In just 20 minutes, I feel like I've already seen all the game has to offer. Some interesting achievements might have gone a little further in expanding the concept, or maybe some more powerups and upgrades.\n\nAs it stands, it's just a little arcade game. Perhaps a good mindless game to unwind and abnegate with, but not great for extended play sessions. The frustrating difficulty (not to mention the game taunting you if you play poorly enough) and lack of depth make it get old fast.","August 24, 2015","false","0.8"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/buttimedia/recommended/303840/","buttimedia","[G@mer]But terd","http://steamcommunity.com/id/buttimedia/","577 products in account","First Try on Point Perfect\n\nThe video is available here:\nhttp://youtu.be/JSK7RcIvs9Q\nLet's start off with the fact that the game uses 8-bit graphics and music, which you might have figured out already, when you've watched the promotional material of the game. With that said, if you are not a fan of the modern 8-bit style, you might not want to buy that game. Other than that I have to say that the asthetic of the game appeals to me personally and I find it good for what it is.\n\nLet's move on to the options menu: There is no slider for the music, only a button to switch it on or off. For sound effects there are more options available.\nGraphicswise the only option is how big of a window you want. Even with pressing several F-Keys on the Keyboard and pressing alt+enter, I was not able to have a fullscreen mode, you basically the best you can get is a windowed fullscreen.\nGameplaywise this could lead to the problem of you going out of bounds with your mouse and locking it into position as long as you are not going back into bounds. What has to be said though is that the game immeadiately recognizes the position of your mouse when you back into bounds, which dampens the harm that is done here greatly. It has to be said as well that you should not go out of bounds that often, since the game encourages you to have controlled mouse movement via instantly killing you when you move around too frantically.\n\nSo, into the game we venture and we find us dying immediately... at least that was me at my very first attempt. The game punishes your old habits of trying to swipe over/into enemies or to klick them. After the initial shock the game shows itself with a relatively smooth learning curve, giving you the chance to improve with every round you play.\nThe game has hard parts as well, but none of which can be considered unfair. The bossfights seem unbeatable at first, but with enough practice you will find out what they can do and deal at least a little damage to them.(Which is as far as I have got)\nStagewise I can say that you have a pool of stages which will come randomly and so far(after about 10 games, which are 30 runs) I found for myself enough variety in them. When you don't get past the first boss for a very long time though it might become repetetive so keep that in mind.\n\n\nFinally the tl:dr: Is it worth it?\nIf you are a fan of casual games, which you can pick up, play them for 10-20 minutes and put them away again, I consider it a definite buy for you.\nFor the avid gamer who wants his old habits questioned by another game(after antichamber and the stanley parable), I'd say buy it.\nFor the people that don't find themselves in one of the two groups, described above, I'd wait for a sale, if I were you.\nAnd finally, if you can't be asked with anything the game has to offer or you find the problems I've stated too big of an issue, I would leave my hands off that game\nAs for myself, I have to say, I enjoyed it and I can recommend it.","July 18, 2014","true","1.5"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","64","9","14","3","0"

It's not nearly as difficult as the store page makes it out to be; it's surprisingly well-balanced, clever, and fair.\n\nIn this game, you control the same mouse cursor that is used by your operating system (if you find the game too difficult, you might have to tweak your mouse's speed and acceleration settings, or just get a better mouse). You defend yourself by dodging enemies and gain points by drawing selection boxes around enemies. You can collect up to 3 powerups to expand the size of your selection box, but you'll lose them if you die. And that's all there is to it.\n\nThe biggest problem with this game is that, despite its simplicity, it doesn't explain itself very well at first. Each time you play, you will play a "set" of three games. At the end of the three games, your worst score is dropped and your two best scores are added together to make your score total. Additionally, you can choose one of three classes each game which will give a useful perk, and you are also randomly given an item every game which you can choose to keep or drop in favor of your old item (if you still have it). It’s not complicated at all, but without a tutorial of some kind, newcomers are bound to get confused with all the icons flashing across the screen when they just want to try playing the game for the first time.\n\nThe other problem with this game is that one boss (“Invader Prime”, which you are not guaranteed to fight each game) can kill you completely at random giving you no chance to defend yourself, unless you flip to Windowed mode for the duration of the fight and abuse a certain interface quirk (moving the mouse off the screen and entering from another side, effectively teleporting the mouse). It’s a pretty strange design flaw in such an otherwise well-designed game, although this same interface quirk can be used to cheese many other challenges in the game, making them much easier. This trick is actually endorsed by the game’s creator, so it must be a feature and not a bug, right?\n\nOverall, I had a lot of fun with this game, and I never felt that a death wasn’t my fault. Although the final objective of the game is ridiculously difficult, it’s not achievement-related at all, and the hardest achievement is fairly reasonable and satisfying to attain. Recommended for anyone who ever had any sort of fun with the BIT.TRIP series, and would like to try conquering a game that isn’t half as hard.","April 6, 2015","true","12.3"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"
