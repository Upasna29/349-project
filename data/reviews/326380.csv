Nothing new is added to the genre , but it also doesn't fail anywhere .You combine a few things e.g. glue with another object  and of course you riddle the hidden-object scenes . A bit short ( I finished the game and bonus chapter in around 4 hours )\n\nMusic /Sound 7/10\nThe sound of the environment is well done , you've got the sizzling sound of fire , rain, and so on .There 's no real epic background music (like in Skyrim ) , but some nice relaxing and sometimes suspense adding tunes , that are actually quite nice . Well IMHO this music fits this type of game way better as epic music would draw the attention away from the puzzles .\n\nStory 7/10\nWell the story as almost always in hidden object games  is kind of ...how to say .hmm...not very logical , a little far off.. but honestly I don't really care with these games ... they're still fun .So don't expect anything life changing or really touching , story wise .\n\nIt supports Steam Cloud and has various achievements .\n\nSynopsis :\nGood game for a rainy day...or a few hours of hidden-object fun .","March 14, 2015","true","3.9"," 26 of 30 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","26","30","0","1"

While overall I'm giving it a recommended because the good outweighs the bad, I'd advise to wait on buying for there to be some actual guides out there because this game sorely needs a guide.\n\nPros:\n+NIce visuals.  The style is very good and makes everything look really nice and prevents it from suffering from some of the issues that can exist in the genre.\n+Pretty good story.  It's a nice mystery with a logical premise and doesn't rely heavily on the supernatural which does make for a refreshing change of pace.\n+Good characters.  The characterization is pretty solid and the characters are reasonably interesting.\n+I loved the elements of the camera, UV light and night vision goggles.  It was neat to be able to take a pic of something and use it for a puzzle later or the character would send it to someone and get an email back later about what the object was.\n\nCons\n-The hint system is really not too good.  Hints recharge fast, and that's awesome, but the issue is that about the most direction you'll get is what location to go to, but when you get to that location you have to figure out what to do and if you're stuck it becomes click around everywhere trying to find something new.  If you are playing on easy at least you get some direction with blinking on items you can pick up and interact with, but I also found some didn't blink and it still led to some pixel hunting and guesswork.\n-Some of the puzzles are sorely lacking in direction.  One example of this is some puzzles where you find zodiac symbols painted somewhere and some tokens.  You got the order the tokens go in, but then you also have to put some decorations into the right order as well, with absolutely no idea how they should go and each token has 4 different combinations multiplied by 4 tokens total, which makes for a lot of trial and error to actually solve the puzzle.\n\nSo overall, it's a good enough game, but some core gameplay elements will leave you frustrated and wanting to turn to a guide that at the time of writing this, doesn't seem to exist or at least my google skills are failing to find one.  The game runs fine, definitely doesn't have any bugs that I've found yet, the main issue is going to be how little direction you are given and how the hint system barely is of any help and that makes the game harder than it needs to be.","February 21, 2015","true","5.2"," 18 of 21 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","18","21","0","3"

It was commissioned to be built by Ludwig II of Bavaria in 1869 and has been open to the public since 1886.  The game takes place in this historical setting with a couple of conspiracy theories thrown in to liven up the plot.\n\nStoryline: Sarah Hamilton of Fact and Fancy (newspaper) stalled in her investigation of a credit fraud scam is sent to Neuschwanstein to investigate rumors about unusual amounts of debris being generated in the refurbishment of the Neushwanstein.  Once there, she meets the resident historian/criminologist Dr. Alder and the castellan Beatrix von Lohen.  Together with Dr. Alder, Sarah uncovers what has been happening during the refurbishment and runs across an ancient mystery.\n\nFirst of all, I am very impressed by the historical accuracy of Neuschwanstein, King Ludwig II of Bavaria and the authenticity of the castle's interior scenes presented in this game; so few games even try for accuracy when basing their story lines on real places or eras.  The game includes factoids about King Ludwig II and Neuschwanstein, mostly in the form of Dr. Alder's notes and occassional commentary.  Big thumbs up here for accurate information!\n\nHowever, do let the educational aspect put one off.  The game play is both easy and challenging at the same time.\n\nHow can this be? One is probably asking.   Answer: Easy to follow and fast paced storyline with challenging puzzles.\n\nGameplay: A nicely blended combination of point and click elements, hidden object scenes and puzzles in a linear story which occurs over six days.  There is a very useful and needed for a few locations fast travel map.   In casual mode, the map shows the places where an action is still required or some clue needs to be found.  No penalties for hints or skips.  Achievements for this game can be earned in a single play through and are for the most part story related.  Nothing is timed.  Three game modes but I suggest Casual play for the little sparkles for two reasons.  1) It is much easier to find the puzzle locations, HO scenes, items, and clues since some are quite small and seem almost hidden.  2) No achievement for Hard mode.  There is a bonus chapter (day 6) which is a mystery all by itself and in some ways ties up the loose ends found in the main story line.\n\nSome special features: The player gets to use their cellphone for emails and as a camera, a UV light, fingerprint powder, and night vision goggles.  The cell phone also holds various folders: one for Sarah’s notes, Dr. Alder’s notes, and King Ludwig’s diary pages.  Plus there is a task folder.  Reading the notes, emails, diary pages prompts the game forward to the next set of tasks.\n\nHidden Object scenes: Found in logical places like drawers and wall recesses or when looking inside of something.  The HO scenes blend into the gameplay without standing out and the stuff found in the scene is what one would expect to find in that location.  Basically no contrived or ‘just because’ HO scenes.   No find clue is unfairly hidden, but they do blend well into the scene so some are quite tough to find even though they are in plain sight.  There are also interactive clues so look closely for the cursor change.  Some of these finds are quite small, and once again not unfairly hidden and in plain sight.  Some find clues are a bit unusual like cube is a dice die.  So feel no shame in using that Hint button especially when looking for some of the interactive pieces.  NOTE: Late in the game the UV light needs to be used to find some interactive clues. The player is generally prompted by the game when the camera, email, UV light or night vision goggles are needed.\n\nPuzzles: Healthy brain work out challenges and found on locks, computer, and equipment usually.  Logic and maze types mostly: 1) Locks – get the correct combination within X amount of moves.  2)Computer hacking puzzles – free flow type where the players needs to connect the same colors in a continuous “line”.  These are quite a challenge because the grid is not square and each puzzle has three levels. 3) Lock picking – use the lock pick to open the lock in X amount of moves. 4) Connect wires across a moveable tile grid. 5) Skipping/jumping stones – eliminate stones from playing field by jumping over them until only the DESIGNATED STONE is left in the CENTER.  Tough but doable.  6) Rotating sliders.  7) Matching.\n\nGameplay is about 5-6 hours and well worth the price for many reasons from a built history lesson to a great storyline to challenging HO scenes to brain twister puzzles.","May 10","true","9.1"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

This was the first game I have played of this type, and I really enjoyed it until towards the end. The big problem for me is that the puzzles get diabolically hard, and there is no real explanation of most of them as to exactly what you have to do to solve them. There is only a single guide on Steam, for one particular puzzle, and no google matches for any of the other puzzles. Instead, to get past a lot of them, I had to resort to a Let's Play series on YouTube (and even they didn't manage to solve all the puzzles, thankfully there is a 'skip' button). So, if you like hard puzzles and point and click games, this is a game for you. If you want to try something new, then keep in mind the hard puzzles. If you don't like difficulty in a game (and I don't, I don't play games for the challenge), then this game may not be for you.","March 17, 2015","true","7.0"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"
