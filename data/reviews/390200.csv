There needs to be an intriguing storyline, great artwork, and an overall high level of presentation. With the right talent, these games can be beautiful and memorable experiences. So it pains me to say that Queen's Quest: Tower of Darkness is a disappointment. While it delivers on the basic attributes of the genre, it is lacking in every other respect.\n\n"Hello everybody!" The Evil Wizard exclaims as he makes his entrance. "I'll be taking your precious baby."\n"Damn you!" Says the Queen. "I will get my child back. Just you wait!"\n\nThis is the entire storyline for Queen's Quest. In a good hidden object game, this would merely be the opening. Instead, I've spoiled practically everything. Actually I take that back. There is one minor twist, but you'll either see it coming or not even care to notice. Going further, there aren't really any recurring characters. The Evil Wizard will appear at the beginning of a new location to remind you that he's still the villain, but nobody else you meet has any significance to the plot (even if they pretend otherwise). Also, you have a fairy for a companion. Well, she's less of a companion, more of a tool. You use her to collect objects from high places.\n\nDue to the genre's low-budget, I'm not concerned about issues such as bad voice-acting. Still, when listening to some of the dialogue in this game, I really have to wonder what everyone was thinking. However, I shouldn't complain too much, because I got a good laugh out of the delivery of one of the pirate's lines. Perhaps all of the voice-actors should have hammed it up, seeing as how there's no real story, and the incidents that occur are very bland. It also has to be said that the characters are pretty ugly. The scenes you explore can look great, but the few people you meet are just.....ick.\n\nThe bonus chapter -- a common attribute of Artifex Mundi titles -- is especially laughable. This minor addition deals with a problem that should have been resolved in the main game. Again, there's nothing in the way of story, and little in terms of actual content. There are a whopping two scenes, a few mini-games, and one hidden-object puzzle. I understand it's tradition, but after completing the bonus chapter, I think it'd be more entertaining if it wasn't included.\n\n-----SPOILER WARNING-----\n\nThe point of the bonus chapter is to rescue your husband. The Evil Wizard turned him to stone in beginning of the main game, but you forget about saving him by the end. Thankfully, your handy dandy stone-to-flesh potion is located just two rooms away. Personally, I would have let him rot (erode?). Why? The Evil Wizard said that the husband isn't actually a real Prince. This twist is so unimportant I don't know why I'd call it a twist, but by the end of the main-game, the Queen didn't seem to care about the fate of her husband. Maybe they have a rocky relationship? Who knows!\n\n-----END OF SPOILERS-----\n\nI don't have any complaints about the puzzles. There are a good number of them, and the hidden-object sections are alright. However, there's nothing that really stands out. This is just as well, considering that I'd hate to recommend an altogether poor game just because it has one or two stand-out puzzles. This isn't the allure of the hidden object genre. What really matters is the presentation, and this is where the game falls short. All in all, Queen's Quest: Tower of Darkness simply isn't worth the time. There are some nice visuals, and the later scenes feature a good usage of color, but they're all part of a nonexistent plot involving uninteresting characters.\n\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group","September 17, 2015","false","4.1"," 42 of 50 people (84%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","84","42","50","5","3"

The visuals can be adjusted in the option menu.\n\nGame Audio\nI want to mentioned that the audio for this game is well done even its simplistic and somewhat repetitive. The audio can be adjusted in the option menu as well.\n\nGame Voice Overs\nNormally, I don't have any comments to say about voice overs in games. Since that they're generally decent. But it's a different story with this game. Few of the voice overs are acceptable but while some do required a bit more effort.\n\nGameplay\nThere are only three difficulty game modes to choose from: Regular, Advanced and Expert.\n\nDiary Notebook it has two sections. Objectives and Notes.\n\nThere is an option for locking the inventory in place to keep it stationary.\n\nThere are interactive items in the game. These items are marked with a symbol but sometime they require extra items before they can be interact with.\n\nThe interactive map allows the player to fast travel between each location quickly. It also indicates there are tasks that needs to be done at certain locations.\n\nThere is a fairy helper, she can help the individual player, by collecting items that are out of reach. The fairy helper isn't automatically given at the start of the game.\n\nMost of the game's hidden object scenes consists of traditional word lists with some or no interaction. Some of these hidden object scenes can be played over again in the extra section.\n\nMost of the game's puzzles are fairly easy to solve without having the need to skip any of them. Some of these puzzles can be played over again in the extra section.\n\nSince this game is a collector's edition, it comes with extra contents, "Wallpapers;" "Concept Arts;" "Music;" "Bonus Chapter."\n\nThere are collectibles in the game. "Swords," "Hooks," "Crowns" and "Apples" all of them are scattered throughout the entire game to find.\n\nThere are twenty-two different achievements. But each of these achievements has certain requirements before they can be unlocked.\n\nThe bonus chapter can be accessed only after the main story is fully completed. This bonus chapter is the sequel to the main story. This chapter relatively short, since it took a couple of minute or so to complete it; this chapter should have been included in the main story.\n\nMiscellaneous\nThere extra contents for the game can be accessed through the game's main splash page under the extras.\n\nThere are total of six different trading cards. You only get the three of those cards from the game. There are several ways to get the rest of the trading card: Purchased from Steam's Market; Trade with friends; Booster Packs and it's Booster Pack Creator.\n\nFinal thoughts, I've found this game enjoyable to certain extend. The replay value for this game is low. I would recommend this game but not at the full price.","March 16","true","5.4"," 17 of 17 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","17","17","2","1"

Make no mistake, these developers know how to craft this type game.\n\nThe Midline\nThe art is ok.\nVoice acting pleasent and unremarkable.\nPuzzels are just more of the same. So just like every other hidden object game, that the staleness is smellable.\nIt's too very easy.\n\nCons\nThe plot is all over the place. Pick a genre already!\nAnd the protagonist is completely uncompelling.\n\nLook I love hidden object games. This by no means, not a bad game in any way. It's just not in the top 20 great hidden object games list. It's mearly ok. So if you've love hidden object games, it's worth buying.

The puzzles are challengely hard even on easy level and I have spent a few hours tearing my hair out at times but I like challenges in games and the need to work hard to achieve my achievements at the end of the game. The visual artwork in the game to me was very well thought out and incredibly beautiful in places almost where I felt part of the scenes and the emotional factor was a biggie in this game too. I felt so in tune with the characters and enjoyed the happy endings knowing that I had helped achieve that. I loved the sound effects and the music and felt that it kept in line with the game and I also enjoyed the hidden object scenes. I am a huge fan of the find and seek scenes but it would have been nice to have hidden object scenes where you have to use one object to interact with another object etc. That aside, I had huge fun playing and finding items for my journey. This game is very hard to stop playing and I have still got work to do which I will tackle in good time. The only downfall for me was the length of the game and the bonus adventure was a bit disappointing as it wasn't very long and there wasn't a huge impact ending that I probably expected. I wish the game could have been longer but that's my only beef. I thoroughly enjoyed playing and I would definitely recommend it to you if you are a huge HOG fan like myself. You won't be disappointed. A well thought of, impacting and exciting game.","September 12, 2015","true","9.1"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","13","15","0","2"

The King Consort is turned into stone and it is up to the Queen to save her child, her kingdom and her husband. Simple enough story for a fairy tale.\n\nThe main game plays out in basically four chapters: the castle, the kingdom outside, the ship, and the dark/evil wizard's island.  The bonus chapter is an epilogue with the added twist of using a magnifying glass to find unseen objects for one particular objective.  The game is mostly puzzles and Hidden object scenes with a bit of point and click.  Nothing too hard and for advanced players this game will seem easy.  There are some quite cute objectives like finding Mr. Pig for his wife.\n\nMost mini-puzzles are fairly standard but there is one per area that I can only call the "boss" puzzle.  It is harder then the rest as well as non-standard fare.  Those "boss" puzzles make one think and scratch the head.  There is one I swear someone spiked the difficulty level on to super maximun hard.  There is also no achievement for that "boss" puzzle like the others which makes me wonder if someone expects most players to skip it.\n\nThe hidden object scenes are neat, uncluttered, and generally relate to their location so it does not seem like a pile of junk just dumped there.  Every Hidden object scene gets played twice and the previous finds are not there making getting the achievement "find everything in less then a minute" easy to accomplish.  One last thing about the Hidden Object scenes there are morphing find clues which is quite clever.\n\nMost of the negative reviews center on the cutscene graphics.  Since I am not overly sure when this game was originally released to the public (I found YouTube videos of walk/playthroughs from about a year ago (2014), in German.) this might explain the graphics, which I personally found just fine.\n\nAll achievements can be accomplished in a single playthrough so there is no forced second playthrough just to gain missed achievements.\n\nThere are four sets of extra finds: crowns in the castle, swords in the outside kingdom, hooks on the ship, and apples on the wizard's island.  They are easy to see and easy to find.\n\nOverall this is fun family oriented game and relatively short.","September 16, 2015","true","9.5"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

The puzzles are fine, the voice acting is mid-line which is normal and doesn't particularly faze me, and the scenes are somewhat pretty but that's really about it. It only took me about 2 hours to complete; the only reason it says I have 6.6 on record is because I left the game on pause and went to do other things. That's how utterly uninteresting it was.\nYou play as a Queen, (who'd have guessed?), who apparently, despite wearing what looks like a modern-day Prom dress, has to do everything herself, included fixing and loading a ballista and a ship. That's probably hard to do in heels.\n\nAnyway, it's just a very bland game.

It's not an amazing game but it's not a horrible game either. It feels like an older Artifex Mundi game so I won't factor in the age for my review since I'm just happy to have a chance to play another fun game. But I will say right now, get this game on sale only.\n\nThe story is the worst part of the game. You play a beautiful queen, marry a guy, have a baby and it's kidnapped. That's about as deep as the story goes. None of the characters are fleshed out or have much personality and the story is cliche. Even after learning why the villain kidnapped the baby I felt very uninterested. Near the end he gives you the option to join him or die, I really wanted to see how the game would be if I could have joined him! But nope, it all ends the way you'd expect. The bonus chapter, which is very short and uneventful, requires you to save your husband from his stone prison. No epic quest either, just three areas of the castle.\n\nStory aside, the gameplay is good. The mini games offer a challenge as well as a headache. The hidden object scenes are also entertaining. My only gripe would be that certain objects in the hidden item scenes will blink and change shapes so you have to catch it at certain times. Not exactly hard but a little annoying. But that it's enough for me to dislike the game. The mini games and hidden object scenes were the only thing keeping me playing.\n\nBut, it is a short game and it's not too hard to collect all the achievements for it.

I have feeling that graphics are not as good as other Artifex games and the voice acting is really bad, I had to laugh sometimes when I heard some characters speaking. Story is poor and boring. Puzzles, if you played any other Artifex game you know exactly what you can expect. If you want to buy this just to spend some time solving puzzles go for it, now it is for sale 4.8Euro. Otherwise look for other Artifex games they are much better","September 12, 2015","false","2.5"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","1"

"Look, shorty. I'm the QUEEN! Gimme back that piggy bank, or I'll cut off your beard!"\n\nThe queen wants to leave the courtyard? Nope, the guard won't let her through until a particular flag is raised. "Jerk, I'm the QUEEN! Now open this stupid gate or else I'll hoist you up that flagpole!"\n\nA building is on fire? The fireman can't put it out until the queen fixes the watermain. "Nincompoop! I'm the QUEEN! Which means I am upper management! Crawling in the gutter is not in my job description!"\n\nA dragon is blocking the way to the port? No royal guards in sight, the queen must dispatch the dragon by herself. "Listen, worm... I'm the QUEEN! Now fly your scaly behind out of my realm this instant before I have you made into a thousand fabulous handbags!"\n\nThe queen's ship is attacked by a kraken and the sailors on board do nothing to fend off the beast. Guess this is another job for Her Majesty. "Hey salty dogs! I'm the QUEEN! Now I command you to drink more rum and keelhaul that giant squid!"\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\nIf you can get beyond the dopey storyline and the fact that stuff often doesn't make sense here, the game is not terrible. Just don't pay full price for this- wait until it is on sale.","April 6","true","2.6"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

Artifex Mundi makes pretty decent ones in general.  But this is one of their least inventive, and it's not one they themselves developed, only published.  It's short and simple and not very compelling, but it hits many of the notes similar to the rest of their games.  I completed the game, bonus game, and all of the achievements in under 4 hours.  5/10 from me.","September 14, 2015","false","3.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sgbeal/recommended/390200/","sgbeal","sgbeal","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sgbeal/","66 products in account","What i love best about this title is the main character's OCD. Her baby was just kidnapped by a dragon-wielding Dark Wizard and yet she'd rather search the castle for half an hour for something to apply glue with, rather than just spread it on with her finger. She is not strong enough (or is too stubborn) to push the curtains aside, and resolves to build some scissors to cut them in half instead.\n\nOf course, such are the tribulations of HOPA protagonists. OCD in the extreme. They cannot pick up an item until they find all other pieces of it and assemble it in the place where the initially found it (as opposed to carrying it around (btw: a barrel is too heavy for her to shove aside, but she'll not hesitate to stuff a stone column(!!!) in her pocket for later use... on a high ledge(!!!)).\n\nBut without OCD, they wouldn't be the star of a HOPA game, so it kinda goes with the territory. "HOPA protagonist must be OCD or have similar disorders which prohibit them from, e.g., simply breaking a window to get at an object on the other side (instead they are forced _insist_ on finding a glass cutter)." It's a simple fact.\n\nOne true complaint so far: the "knights and dragons" puzzle's description is so far removed from the solution that one can accurately call the puzzle's rules a bald-faced lie. i eventually gave up on it, tapped Skip, and was appalled at the solution which was revealed - it violated the description text at least 5 times.\n\nAnd one minor complaint: ambiguous words in HO scenes upset me. One scene wants you to find a "bow" and has both a ribbon-bow and a violin bow (right next to each other, too). Aaarrggg.\n\nTaken with a grain of salt, and a hefty dose of mocking the protagonist for her odd ways, this journey is turning out every bit as fun a romp as most of Artifex Mundi's works. i'm liking it better than their Demon Hunter title, but not finding it as engrossing as the newer Enigmatis 2 and Eventide titles (both of which set new standards for this genre, IMO). Somewhere in between Demon Hunter and Eventide/Enigmatis. Graphically excellent. Music is... unmemorable, apparently, as i can't recall a single note of it. The voice-overs are actually quite good. The subtitles to the voice-overs have a few very minor grammatic problems, but nothing terribly distracting (look who's OCD now!).\n\nThere are some colorful characters here, like Mr. and Mrs. Piggy Bank, and some grumpy dwarves who accept the protagonist as their Sovereign Queen, yet refuse to give her the items she's searching for until she performs favors for them. As mentioned above - take such with a grain of salt, because a HOPA isn't a HOPA if NPCs simply hand you everything you need.\n\ni had to laugh my butt off when the protagonist put her baby in her inventory. Just classic.\n\nOh, and having a little fairy in your inventory, useful to access certain out-of-reach places, is pretty cool.\n\ni've gotta thumb this one up.\n\nPS: my greatest thanks to the devs for their continued support for Linux. All of their titles i've tried (about 6 or 8 of them) have worked flawlessly on my system (currently Mint Linux 17.3).","April 8","true","3.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Not the best but not the worst. The story is fairly linear and not Artifex Mundi's best, but for the most part the puzzles are enjoyable and the hidden objects sections are good. There are a couple of hidden object sections where there are more than one of the same object and you have to click the correct one (i.e. it asks for one mirror and there are two mirrors on the screen). Annoying, but not game breaking. If you want a pretty standard hidden object experience you could do much worse than this one.","January 17","true","4.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
