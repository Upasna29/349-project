The game became popular because of one thing, and one thing only: it was scary. Tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands likely bought this game because they wanted to get scared; they wanted a joyride complete with overwhelming fear. I don't blame them. The game is pretty scary, but here's the thing:\n\nIt seems that most people do not understand that Amnesia, and the games before it, were not just haunted-house amusement park rides like they like to act like it is. No, it's a lot more than that. The game has thick atmosphere, superb pacing and storytelling backed by a very dark story that keeps you curious from beginning and even to the end. To be able to truly appreciate TDD, you need to look further than the scare factor; it is not the only thing that made the game great. Guess what the Chinese Room capitalised on? The story. They wanted to tell a story, much like TDD did. MFP was much more of a psychological experience; the game did not need to scare you with darkness or spooky monsters, all it needed was an incredibly wicked story. This was fulfilled. I expected an atmospheric, thought-provoking horror experience that would keep me on the edge and this is exactly what the game did.\n\nBut what did everyone else expect? Probably something entirely different. They probably just wanted to get scared. Most of the fanbase is filled with people that appreciated TDD for nothing more than its scare factor, and therefor this is all they had expected from MFP. They are probably the kind of people that either skipped or skimmed through most of TDD's note readings, not givng a ♥♥♥♥ about the backstory whatsoever. They just wanted to get to the next "scare." The bad reception for this game purely comes from delusioned expectations, is what I believe. Horror is a much deeper genre than you'd think.

To start with the good, it excels at creating atmosphere.  There are some great scenes and very fitting music.  You get a small taste of a story that would probably have been interesting if they told you more of it, but then that’s all there is.\n\nThey give you an unlimited light source and simplify all other parts of the gameplay so you can just stroll through the one path they left you and let them tell you the story, which feels like a movie adaptation of a book where you can tell something's missing unless you've read the book, but there's no book.\n\nI can’t understand why they used the Amnesia title for this game which plays NOTHING like The Dark Descent.  It would have been a sort of okay game if they hadn’t tried to associate it with Amnesia, but since they did it's actually misleading on top of mediocre, so I recommend ignoring it and waiting for whatever comes out of Frictional next.","January 23, 2014","false","5.7"," 349 of 452 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","349","452","0","3"

It was developed by The Chinese Room: the studio behind Dear Escher. When I discovered that during its development, I became skeptical as to the quality of this game. I did, however, respect that it was a spiritual successor of Amnesia: The Dark Decent, and figured that it still had the opportunity to be an intriguing horror experience. I was incorrect.\n\nMy first complaint comes from simplified mechanics, of which there are barely any at all. The inventory system has been removed entirely, and with both health and sanity. Managing health becomes trivial, as there are no situations in which you must do so, while sanity has been removed altogether. Hiding in the darkness no longer has its trade offs, while looking at the monsters does nothing. Monsters now only make your electric lamp flicker from quite distance away, removing the fear of their presence. This is part of another changed mechanic: oil conservation has been done away with as well in favor of the infinite energy electric lamp. At this point, only the levels themselves are left to make the game live up to its predecessor, which they don't.\n\nThe game has been designed to be insultingly linear. Each level is a single, straight, path with no choices on how to proceed. The vast majority of monster encounters are scripted, along with a dozen or so out of place shock scares (I could reveal all of them and not spoil the plot). The levels themselves are badly designed and a pain to navigate, with large inaccessible areas and crappy lighting only made worse by the infinite lamp. The puzzles are all remarkably simple now that the inventory is gone. The only thing that makes this worse is the writing of the story.\n\nIn the first act, The Chinese Room makes sure you know they made it by coming in so heavy with metaphors that you can't decipher any real context until you are a good amount into the game. As you try to ground yourself in the game's story, TCR continuously throws "deeper meaning" straight at your face until the story becomes completely drowned in its own pretentious metaphors and symbolism by the third act in a way that is relatable to the Matrix trilogy. The only parts of the story that feel as though they actually belong in the Amnesia universe are the references to the original game (albeit with one glaring inconsistency).\n\nTL;DR:\nOverall, I disapprove of this game. The mechanics are simplified, the levels are horribly designed, and the story feels like it was written by an undergraduate art student. If you have never played Amnesia: The Dark Decent, buy that instead. If you have played it, then still don't buy this. Wait for SOMA.","December 24, 2013","false","7.4"," 192 of 241 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","192","241","0","0"

But the troubles start before you've even properly begun. The game is full of bugs. Forums are filled with people (myself included) trying to figure work-arounds for issues like constant in-game lag (has nothing to do with the quality of your rig or having the necessary audio/video drivers updated), random graphic hitches that filter the screen in a blue, washed-out color, and audio stuttering. Some of the fixes work, though mostly for temporary periods. If you do manage to run the game properly after all that:\n\nPROS:\n\n+ The environment is great. The mansion is atmospheric, spooky and interesting to explore.\n+ The voice acting is very good.\n\nCONS:\n\n- First and foremost: The game is just not scary. It's not Amnesia. It's Dark Esther. It's not survival and stealth, it's exploration. There's next to no tension.\n- The tinderboxes (requiring you to work on conserving them for light) are gone. Instead you have a lantern that never goes out. Considering that the mansion is pretty well lit 90% of the time, I found I hardly needed to use it (even with Gamma turned down)\n- The sanity system is gone, and with it the tense effort to remain sane in the wake of prowling monstrosities.\n- The monsters. The pigmonsters are not scary. They're just silly looking. They don't pursue you with the intensity of the creatures in Dark Descent and you can look at them without fear of insanity, which whittles away the mysterious fear factor very quickly.\n- The story is just dull. There is some possibility in the beginning that it might go in a certain, disturbing direction based on the narrative given, but it turns out to be pretty boring and a bit nonsensical. The characters just aren't very interesting. You don't really care very much.\n\nFor the money you pay, I really can't recommend this one. If you must, buy the steam code for it on 99Gamers for cheap, instead of throwing $22 out for it.","April 12, 2015","false","4.8"," 176 of 226 people (78%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","78","176","226","6","0"

It only took about 10 minutes to crush that optimism.\n\nThe supposed sequel to The Dark Descent casts you as a Victorian-era inventor and industrialist, wandering his home in search of his rather ghostly little boys. The chase leads him into the sprawling factory complex he designed for automating the butchering of pigs. Now, Victorian horror is a rich vein to mine, and the setting of a mechanized slaughterhouse really can't be beat. So I hope you can understand the crushing disappointment that comes with seeing this setup wasted. In my first 90-minute session, nothing happened. Nothing. I wandered my mansion, I turned on some machines, I wandered a factory, I changed some fuses, I wandered outside, I turned on a truck, I quit. At no point did I encounter an enemy or anything even remotely threatening.\n\nWhat I did encounter was a lot of poorly-paced jumpscares in the form of loud noises out of the blue and glimpses of scurrying NPCs. Understand that the original Amnesia did the same thing, but with a much better sense of moderation and coupled with an exceptionally strong sound design. A Machine for Pigs completely fails to build the same atmosphere, trading the mysterious whisperings and footsteps of the castle for the playful requests of ghost children (who basically exist to point you to your next objective) and awkward monologues recounting past events. Gone is the sanity system or the balancing of light and dark, along with the entire inventory system as well. You have an infinite lantern at your disposal, which you will need because the lighting in this game is a bit wonky, what with wall lamps and candles failing to cast any significant illumination. Hilariously, the game still uses the obnoxious visual sanity effects without the system... it just hits you with them at scripted points.\n\nI was hoping there was an interesting story here, but the central theme is mangled worse than the creatures you catch fleeting glimpses of. The monologues and notes are disjointed and mostly unrelated. The attempt to write in Victorian styles also does more harm than good, making some notes near incomprehensible. In the end, there's none of the magic of Amnesia here at all. The atmosphere is botched, there's almost nothing to interact with and no reason to search the environment, and the story is nonsensical and poorly conveyed. I was certain there was no way A Machine for Pigs could be such a step down, but my goodness was I wrong.","September 16, 2015","false","1.3"," 148 of 193 people (77%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","77","148","193","4","0"

If you are looking for a survival horror game, there isn't really any "survival" or not even that much "horror" or "game" in this one. The first 90 minutes of this game are frightning as heck, but once you have encountered a few enemies and discovered that they aren't really much of a threat at all, the scary part is over. No feeling of being hunted, no brilliant AI, no mazes, no proper puzzles, no physics or interactivity etc, just a linear path.\n\nHowever, having cleared that out of the way I'm still giving this one thumbs up. Amnesia 2 is about the atmosphere and sense of mystery. Players expecting a challenge or interesting game mechanics are going to be deeply disappointed, but those seeking a good twisted story will get some moderately creepy and disturbing experience. This story has so many levels that it would require an entire book or something to go through all the possible theories. Some claim that despite the effort put into the writing, the plot isn't really that great or sophisticated either, but although it does has some problems, I think it does at least occasionally succeed. From story or atmosphere viewpoint Amnesia 2 is still an average game and if that's your thing, I recommend it.\n\n- 4 hours put into the game, 8 hours put into arguing (speculating) about what the story of Machine for Pigs is about","November 28, 2013","true","4.6"," 265 of 371 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","265","371","0","1"

Theres no need to hide and you can easily run by then in your few encounters.\n- Machine for pigs did nothing to build on the original and instead decided against all of the aspects that made it great, theres no survival or fear for your life.\n- Apart from the very early stages theres barely an ounce of genuine tension. As you went further down this worsened.\n- I suffered like many others with random lag when the talking scenes occured which really ruined any immersion I had, especially towards the terrible ending.\n\nVERDICT?\nThis game offers the biggest deterioration from start to finish I have ever seen and it results in being a boring experience.","May 3, 2015","false","7.1"," 124 of 161 people (77%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","77","124","161","7","0"

No horror game excels Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs in those regards.\n\nNote to anyone who has played Amnesia: The Dark Descent:\n\nPlease do not take this game as a sequel to Amnesia: The Dark Descent. What many people do wrong with this game is that they go with the mindset of the previous Amnesia - going for the horror.\n\nNow, I'm not saying it's wrong to play horror games for the horror in them, and it definitely is not a surprise why people think of this as a sequel, what with the blaring "Amnesia" in the name. However, while the game does make an occasional reference to the original, it's significantly better to think of this as a stand-alone game.\n\nAmnesia: The Dark Descent was made by Frictional Games. They have made a name for themselves by bringing back the horror in the horror genre. Their games have that creeping atmosphere that you can never be rid of. From Penumbra: Black Plague onwards, they took a theme of defenselessness, which definitely has been a big asset.\n\nAmnesia: A Machine for Pigs was made by The Chinese Room. When Frictional Games thought about making a sequel to the Amnesia series, they decided to have an other company make it instead. Being impressed by Dear Esther, they approached The Chinese Room for sharing similar mindsets in their game development. Frictional Games did not want The Chinese Room to make a game that is similar to the original, they wanted them to make a game in their own way.\n\nTwo different companies make a game of the same world, with the same theme.

Most angry MANPIGS are running along on scaffolding above or below you, and are mostly used as set dressing. As you move deeper into the game (especially if you're following the journals & notes) you'll realize you've reached a point where finding MANPIGS wouldn't make sense - and as such you don't. However, the game keeps up with it's eerie sound effects and music queues to a myriad of empty rooms & squandered settings. This retroactively negates the creepiness of the same queues you've been hearing all game.\n\nAlso, the only times I was genuinely scared were from "jump scares", that seemed mostly out of place "AHHH! THE FLOOR COLLAPSED!" or "AHHH! I SEEM TO HAVE BEEN TELEPORTED TO A RANDOM MAZE INCONSISTENT WITH THE REST OF THE GAME'S TONE".\n\nIf you're looking for a weird story, I would advise you to check this game out.

It can still potentially spoil the game's beginning to some degree, I guess. Therefore I put it in spoiler tags; you might want to skip it if you're planning to play the game sometime.\n\n\nMonster encounters are not only rare, the lamp also begins to flicker everytime a monster is near - usually long before it can even be seen. After noticing this the game entirely lost the little tension it had to begin with for me: I always knew when a monster would appear beforehand, when they appeared they rarely posed a danger because of their scripted nature and for whatever reason the effects directly looking at a monster had in Penumbra and TDD are gone as well (or at least toned done a lot), so the horrors that were quiet effectively left to the player's imagination in the predecessors are now shown directly, thus making the game less scary in the end.\n\nSo, to sum it up: there is not much actual gameplay in Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs, it is hardly a game at all.\nThat doesn't necessarily has to be a bad thing. The same thing can probably be said about Telltale's The Walking Dead, but TWD makes up its lack of gameplay with a very well told story.\nHowever AMfP isn't very good storywise either: It's full of horror-pulp stereotypes, making it very predictable, and towards the end the story gets completely lost in a pile of pretentious symbolism.\n\nNot much is missed by skipping AMfP completely. If you liked TDD and haven't played the Penumbra games, better go for them instead - they are a lot better than this new game.\nAlso note that AMfP was not developed by Frictional Games (who made Penumbra and TDD) but by The Chinese Room who apparently moved towards making console games by now (figures). So waiting for Frictional's game SOMA, which is currently in devolpment, could still be worthwile if it turns out closer to the games they made themselves.","November 25, 2013","false","4.5"," 432 of 661 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","432","661","0","18"

The story is interesting, and the settings are well-designed (and certainly more visually interesting than the dull castle of The Dark Descent). If it was just called "A Machine for Pigs", I would have no problem giving it a positive review.\n\nThe problem is that it's not called A Machine for Pigs; it's called Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs, and so the developers are actively encouraging me to review it as an Amnesia game because that's what they're pitching it as to the customer. And in that regard, it's kind of awful. It's important to understand that this game was developed primarily by The Chinese Room, the developers of Dear Esther (which was an interesting story-based exploration game with gameplay summarized as a walking simulator), and not Frictional Games, the creator of the Penumbra and Amnesia games. I've already made it known that I consider Amnesia to be a worse game than the Penumbra series, and this game just takes it a step further down. The worst parts of Amnesia are well in-tact, so you can fully expect to frequently get wobbly vision during setpieces and to constantly get slowed down and visually impaired while the narrator dishes out a bit of story, which consistently kills both the pacing and the atmosphere. But everything else seems to be fair game for the cutting board, since there's no longer a sanity system, you don't have to manage resources like fuel for your light, and you don't even have an inventory. There isn't a puzzle in the game any more complex than "put the coal into the coal chute ten steps away" or "pull the lever", which makes it hard to say that there are even puzzles in the game at all. Enemies are almost nonexistant, with the grand total of actual enemy encounters being about 6, and being generous, taking up about 3 minutes of the 3 or 4 hours it takes to complete the game. They're not even particularly good or long encounters, either; in one particular instance, you suddenly drop into an area with an invisible water monster (which was more or less shamelessly ripped from The Dark Descent in place of actually making something new, with only a single note giving a half-hearted explanation of why it exists in this game), all you have to do is run forward in the only other direction that isn't towards the water monster. The path to the ladder to escape is literally gated by siderails, so it's almost impossible to actually fail the segment. And that sentiment applies to all of the game's sparse encounters; each of them is a very scripted, very setpiece-like instance where the monster shows up, you hide in the designated hiding place, the monster walks by, and you continue your merry way. It's very safe and guided, and you never really get the feeling of being in any real danger. The game does a lot to try to build up atmosphere, but it falls flat after the first thirty minutes or so because you very quickly realize that the game is never actually going to pay off on the tension beyond quick fleeting glimpses of a monster or a sudden banging noise that has no purpose other than to try to get a jump out of you (which makes up about 2/3 of the game's "scares").\n\nUltimately I would still recommend this game at a heavy discount, since all things considered it's still not the worst horror game on Steam (though that isn't saying a whole lot, considering thanks to Steam Greenlight even Bad Rats is no longer the worst game on Steam) and it does have an interesting plot, but if you're looking for more of what you've come to expect from Frictional Games then either wait for SOMA or download Penumbra: Necrologue.","June 21, 2015","true","4.1"," 55 of 73 people (75%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","75","55","73","4","2"

This game is such a dissapointment.\nIf ''The Chinese Room'' didnt get involved this could've been so much better.\nThey didnt try to make Amnesia 2, they tried to make a sequel to Dear Esther.\n\nI loved the story in TDD, it had the perfect balance between gameplay and story. This one is more focused on the story but I couldn't really get into it because it's so effin boring. There was not a single scary moment in this game and the 'monsters' you'll face later on are no threat to you and you can just casually walk past them. Your character is never in any actual danger. You couldn't check your sanity; tinderboxes and oil didn't exist. You don't have an inventory so don't even bother exploring. But why mention it? You can't do that anyway since every door in this game is locked unless you have to actually go through it. If you loved grabbing random sh*t in TDD and throwing it at the enemy or just against a wall - you can't do it in this one cause everything is locked in place.\nThe nerve wrecking atmosphere from TDD is completey lost, you don't have to worry about oil for your lantern cause it is unlimited.\n\nI quit the game 3 times but I kept giving it a chance because I WANTED it to be good but there is really no hope for this.

The IP was handed off to a developer team called THE CHINESE ROOM. THE CHINESE ROOM are the\nones responsible for creating this game and FRICTIONAL GAMES, was only involved in PUBLSHING (NOT CREATING)\nbut publishing this game. The Chinese Room are also the author's of the narrative driven game Dear Esther.\n\nSo in short, AAMFP is a game that is highly different than it's predecessor TDD(The Dark Descent.)\n\nLet's do a quick run through of Pros vs Cons.\n\nPros:\n-Good Atmosphere\n-Good Story\n-Good Graphics\n\nCons:\n-Not as frightful\n-Easier Puzzles\n-The Tension that builds early is quickly lost.\n\nThe game itself is narrative driven, more so than the original Amnesia. The story presented in AAMFP is told and built quite well and solid in my opinion. It all led up to a more than predictable climatic ending however. The main difference I noticed between AAMFP and TDD is that often I found myself rushing through AAMFP content at times looking for the next scare/enemy interraction. There is significantly less interraction with enemies in AAMFP which in turn leads to long peroids of time where you're either exploring or solving mediocre puzzles such as changing a bulb, or turning a valve. It is during these extended periods that the fear and immersive dread that was originally built up is lost. However, I still found the encounters with the enemies to be tense at times.\n\nOverall I feel that this game is worth it's retail value, I enjoyed it, I got a good imersion/scare out of playing it and the only real way to know how good this game is is to pick it up and give it a playthrough. As long as you're not expecting a Amnesia The Dark Descent v.2 I believe any true horror genre fan will enjoy this title.","October 14, 2015","true","10.8"," 38 of 50 people (76%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","76","38","50","2","0"

STOP THRUSTING IT IN MY FACE LIKE AN ERECT ♥♥♥♥\n2) No more physics. One fun thing to do in the original was too ♥♥♥♥ around with the physics. They weren't amazing but were still fun. In this game it's a bit different, you cant interact with almost any new objects, and even some of the old objects have had physics removed.\n3) Sanity effects and inventory removed. Another appeal of the original was the sanity system. While not perfect the sanity system had some fun elements that could make the game much scarier at times. And the inventory system could to if you ever ran out of tinderboxes or oil at a bad moment. Not here! You instead get a lantern which occasionaly flickers.Brilliant\n4)The monsters weren't scary. While i was playing at the beginning, I was ♥♥♥♥ing terrified of the horrors that hid within the mansions. Then I eventually got to the first encounter, and lo and behold the monster didn't scare or frighten me.In fact the stupid prick didn't even notice me, he saw my charecter flailing his Lantern like an idiot, and walked right past me.

The only time I felt like i was in actual danger was suring the bit you had to run through the town, while a pig frantically chased you trying to get a autograph.\n5) The water part.

If there is one thing that we can learn from this narrative, it is that wordy and intelligent are not synonyms.  It brushes against interesting themes, but does not reach any conclusion worth noting, aside from the classic video game trope that "evil is bad."  The few encounters with enemy creatures devolve from an intial tense atmosphere to an annoyance, as the player realizes they can always outrun their opponent, and will never be challenged with completing a task while an enemy is present.  Heaven forbid you stumble on one of the half-dozen safe points from which you can view the underwhelming models of the creatures you have been running from.  In the final hour, there is a two-part boss battle which is mind-boggling in both concept and execution, and clashes harshly with the game's established world.  Then you get on the pork shuttle to watch the game play the final act through on its own - though why the final scene concludes the game as the protagonist wishes is not obvious to me.  This is not a technically challenging horror game, and it is not an intellectually challenging narrative adventure.

Unfortunately, that's not exactly easy to do. For one thing, it carries the "Amnesia" title, which sets certain expectations. Also, releasing so close to a similar genre game like Outlast doesn't help either. A Machine for Pigs is nothing like either of those games - it is very much its own beast (no pun intended).\n\nGameplay-wise, it resembles the original Amnesia, in that you explore a creepy location with nothing but the light of a lantern to aid you. The stories of the two games are also connected. But that's pretty much where the similarities end. In the original game, you had to manage resources to keep your light lit (and your character sane), which ended up being a pretty tense balancing act at times. Additionally, running and hiding from monsters was a key gameplay element. However, in AMFP, your lantern never runs out of fuel, the actual monster encounters are few and far between, and hiding is not usually necessary.\n\nThe upshot of these changes make AMFP a very different feeling game. For one, it is not particularly scary. Sure, there are definitely lots of moments of dread where you find yourself not wanting to go through a door or down a dark hallway. However, you soon realize that in most cases, there is actually nothing there to fear. Secondly, the game is very linear and the puzzles are overly simple. Mostly, you just go through a series of corridors and turn on a valve here and there, which opens up the next corridor. It's pretty easy. So this isn't really a horror game in the sense of "scare factor". The horror mostly comes from the feelings created by the environment (level and sound design, which are both excellent), and the story. The story is the high point here, though. Most of it is revealed through notes and audio recordings that are found throughout the levels. The voiceovers, and the writing especially, are very good.\n\nI would say that is the main reason to play this game - the story and atmosphere. As a pure horror/scare-factor game, you will be disappointed. For that, you are better off playing the original Amnesia or genre newcomer Outlast. A Machine for Pigs plays much more like a horror version of Dear Esther (which should come as no surprise, as it was developed by the same people). If that sounds up your alley, definitely give this one a go. Just keep in mind it's not really very scary or action oriented, so if you are expecting a repeat of the original game (or something along the lines of Outlast), you will be severely disappointed. Playtime is around 4 hours or so, give or take. All in all, I felt it was a worthy successor to the Amnesia legacy, in its own way. Probably not as good a game overall, but definitely a unique experience that is worth checking out at some point if you enjoyed the original.","September 22, 2013","true","5.2"," 53 of 84 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","53","84","0","3"

However, that in no way lessens the experience for the gamer or sullies the franchise as is often the case when outside development houses take over in subsequent sequels. In fact by the time the end credits roll on A Machine for Pigs, The Chinese Room have taken you to a far more menacing and psychologicaly darker place than the original Amnesia could have ever have conjured up.\n\nMy main gripe with the original Amnesia was that, whilst utterly terrifying in its first half, its second half was plodded and padded out with puzzles there simply to exist to lengthen the adventure. When it all began to fall back on the familiar supernatural tropes so often trotted out in horror I was left slightly disappointed. The Chinese Room seem to have understood this perfectly, especially when it comes to horror. By toning down the puzzles (there is no inventory to speak of) you end up not being taken out of the horror every five minutes to solve some mind-bending puzzle as was the case in the first one. By removing the need for oil and the sanity meter they have streamlined the experience further which in the end allows the story to move to the forefront. The Chinese Room also seem to understand perfectly that horror and tension can only be sustained for short periods. This was my gripe with both the first Amnesia and Outlast in that they should have been shorter in order to sustain the terror they were trying to convey. Brevity is the golden rule in my books when it comes to horror and any horror game outstaying its welcome in length ends up being a diminished experience. A Machine for Pigs comes in at a pert 4-6 hrs (depending on how you play) and that is the perfect length in my books for a horror title.\n\nA Machine for Pigs is set at the end of the Industrial Era (which the game evokes beautifully) and sees you take control of Oswald Mandus, a rather imposing giant of industry, awaking to a terrifying personal nightmare. Emerging from a hellish fever dream that involves some kind of infernal industrial machine, he soon realizes that both of his children are missing. Once again, like the first, notes lay strewn about the game world that give us insight into his back story. Oswald, you see, is the proud owner of a meat processing factory but as the tale descends into its serpentine labyrinth of terror you soon realize that this is a factory where very little governance seems to have been applied when it comes to the kind of meat being processed for consumption.\n\nWhilst slow going to begin with - the second half of the game really literally picks up and moves at a cracking pace which never seems to let up for one single second as it hurtles towards its grim ending. I was initially a bit disappointed with it but as time marched on I found myself more and more invested in this tale of horror than I was with the initial Amnesia. At the end of it all, all I can say was that I was suitably impressed with this title and if The Chinese Room is drafted in at some stage to make another I can't say I will be disappointed.\n\nIf you enjoy horror there is no reason you should not enjoy this. Machine for Pigs is a far darker, more complex (in terms of the tale its trying to tell) and sinister game experience than the first one and if you go in not expecting a rehash of the first game you are bound to be in for a pleasantly spooky surprise.","April 22, 2014","true","6.4"," 160 of 277 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","160","277","0","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kamfeth/recommended/239200/","Kamfeth","Kamfeth","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kamfeth/","316 products in account","Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs - The second main game from Amnesia series. After the amazing Amnesia: The Dark Descent people wanted next Amnesia, much better than first game, but is it really better? I won't anwer that question, I'll just say that it's "Different", but mostly in positive aspects.\n\nFirst you have to remember that this game wasn't created by Frictional Games like first Amnesia. It was created by The Chinese Room (You can know them if you've played Dear Esther). Ok, but let's talk about the game!\n\nMost of the players didn't like Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs, because a few important aspects from Amnesia: The Dark Descent were cut off in this game. There wasn't any inventory, you couldn't pick up many items like chairs, boxes etc, no tinderbox to pick up and your source of light is unlimited. So the survival aspect of the game don't exist. The only items you can pickup are letters, papers and important items that you have to pickup to move on with story.\n\nMonsters aren't that scary like in first game, but still i have to say that power of imagination in that game still works! I was scared because of simply noises and i thought there is monster nearby. Also i should note that there aren't the "warning alert" when the monster is next to you. That alert was in first Amnesia and in my opinion it's better that it's don't exist here, because if you won't be careful you can me surprised in "negative" aspect of course! Don't get me wrong, Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs is still very scary game, but you can't compare it to the first game.\n\nSoundtrack is amazing! It was composed by Jessica Curry (Same artist like in Dear Esther). The style is again different than from the first game, but it's also amazing and it's fit with all those factory levels and London from fall of XIX century. Go ahead and try it https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fkVvNMuJsA\n\nYou could thought that i already said the most important things from that game, but nope, not yet! Now is The Story\n\nThe story in this game... I can't describe it, if i'll say it's amazing it's not enough. In this aspect Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs owning the first game, no doubt about it! It's very emotional, sad and you'll think about it after you'll finish the whole game. I won't say any spoilers, but to make you curious i'll just say that the "Pigs" in the title of the game is an ambiguous word... In my opinion one of the best stories i've ever been seeing in video games. You should play this game even only because of that story. Also i recommend read all the notes that you'll find in the game from the chronological order after you'll finish the game.\n\nI'm really sad seeing all those negative reviews, most of these people were just looking for Amnesia: The Dark Descent 2, but I really understand them. I was also a little bit dissapointed when i realised i couldn't take chairs and other objects and throw them away, honestly I don't understand why developers removed that, but when i finished the game I was glad i pre-ordered it.\n\nI rate this game 8/10 (Very Good), mostly because of that great story, soundtrack and the whole atmosphere. It isn't that scary like Amnesia: The Dark Descent, so if you're looking for only scary horror game and you don't care about other aspects, then you should buy other game. My english isn't perfect so I apologise for any grammar mistakes, I hope i'll be better in future!","January 8, 2015","true","9.2"," 19 of 25 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","19","25","0","0"

Not necessarily, but then Dark Descent was such an unexpectedly delirious and exhilerating experience. It was a surprise. The difference with its sequel is that people have been expecting A Machine For Pigs for a while; based on those expectations, some were disappointed.\n\nI was not. A Machine For Pigs doesn't need to be as scary as Dark Descent. Of course there are plenty of moments in that game which made my blood run cold, such as the infamous chase through the flooded Archives with a monster snapping at your heels, the damned Prison area which gave me plenty of mini heartattacks, and just the growl of those disgusting monsters. Yet I remember only a few moments from that game, which to me are not as important as the overall experience. What was the most scary for me was actually the story, and learning about Daniel. At the beginning, he's a man that drank the Amnesia potion to make himself forget the horrors the Baron had inflicted. But of course, as we descend deeper into Brennenberg, we realize the truth. Near the end, I wasn't even sure Daniel deserved to be saved (which is why the three different endings pleased me so much).\n\nA Machine For Pigs has a story that is just as good, and in some respects, better than Dark Descent. It has its moments too, but A Machine For Pigs is all about how it leaves you feeling than the individual moments you can remember. The core element of discovering the story through notes, and the journal entries of Oswald, is still there. We learn he's a drunkard (wine is, after all, its own form of Amnesia). We learn he's a butcher. We learn he wants to be more effective at butchering through the use of technology. We learn his wife died in childbirth, which clearly has a bad affect on his sanity (like a true madman, he wants mmotality, and creates a machine to that effect). He apparently wants to save his children, and is guided by a vaguely familiar and sinister voice over the scattered telephones. His journal entries are distrubing enough, littered with contempt, hatred, anger, dispair, and revolting descriptions, all which offer a glimpse into his deranged mind.\n\nYou really need to appreciate the briliance of this, along with the other core elements that made Dark Descent amazing, which A Machine For Pigs definitely has: the sound, the constant oppressive and immersive atmosphere, the music, the voice acting, and the mystery. Despite the tension which keeps you constantly on edge, you want to keep exploring the machine. You feel compelled to descend further down, past the scraping metal, the wails of steam, the screams and groans of the machinery, the flickering lights, the thick, putrid smell as its often described, the pulsing of the engines-A Machine For Pigs does a fantastic job of creating the setting. The fact that I felt no relief when I was briefly outside is also a testament to that accomplishment. The rain slicked and gloomy London streets offered no breath of fresh air.\n\nA Machine For Pigs is memorable for its hauntingly beautiful settings. Now, one of my complaints is that there is not really a sense of urgency. That's practically a requirement given the premise, but unlike the constant fear of having the Shadow chase you in Dark Descent, A Machine For Pigs takes its time delivering on the scares. To be sure, there are scares to be had, and there are a few jumpscares right from the very beginning. The urgency comes in bursts, mostly from being chased by the grotesque pig-men. The puzzles are mostly unnecessary (like the Sanity meter in Dark Descent, which did little more than blur the screen) and mostly frustrating.\n\nInterestingly, while I was playing, I couldn't stop thinking of Pink Floyd's video for Another Brick In The Wall. That's totally a good thing! I also couldn't shake the eeriness, the dread. The disgust, eventually, because just as I felt ultimately repulsed by Daniel, Oswald proved to surpass even Daniel's selfishness and brutality. That's why A Machine For Pigs is so good, in my opinion: the sum of its parts is an experience worth your time and careful attention.\n\nThe blood splattered walls of the factory where the pigs are slaughtered take on an even more vile nature when you read Oswald's diary because his descriptions of people, often as "swine," sends chills down your spine. Pigs are closest to humans, biologically speaking. And Oswald's pursuit of fortune, and of leaving a legacy which survives flesh and bone is accomplished without scruples and through ruthlessness which makes Daniel seem like a saint. His creation is the machine, and the setting of Industrial Revolution era London, with all of its distinct British cruelty, child labour, capitalism, and new technology is simply perfect to tell a story that is fundamentally about greed. And the bloody path we carve to sate it.\n\nAnd there are scares. Some require a bit more thinking and putting the pieces together, some require running away and hiding, some can make you yell and flinch away from the screen. It's good we don't have to gather oil for the lantern (it runs on electricity now, anyway) or that we need to gather an inventory because I think in this context, it would become tedious. Instead, we can focus on the atmosphere, story, and the scares. We can get lost in the growls and squeals, the heavy, incessant labours of the machine, and simply unravel the insanity within.\n\nSo is A Machine For Pigs scary, all in all? That depends on your definition of scary; it will scare you when and where it's supposed to, in a heart pounding, sweaty hands sort of way. Think of it as a rush, a wave of fear that crashes into you, whereas Dark Descent was a constant flood.\n\nYet instead of comparison, we should enjoy A Machine For Pigs rather as its own unique, interesting, and dark vision of human nature. So I think the real question should be: is A Machine For Pigs horrifying? And the answer is absolutely. That is the point, after all.\n\n\nTruly, I am not a fan of horror. I was intrigued by Dark Descent because my friends wouldn't shut up about it, with good reason. Dark Descent became the game which urged me to consider some other ones, and Dark Descent quickly became my favourite horror game, with Outlast being a very close second. I've found that the genre is deeply rooted in all the sorts of sad, brutal, sick and twisted ways humans strip away their humanity (usually by trying to become more than what we are; most of the time, the sacrifices aren't worth it). This game is no exception.\n\nA Machine For Pigs is certainly deserving of sharing the same panicked breath with Dark Descent.","December 26, 2015","true","8.8"," 19 of 25 people (76%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","76","19","25","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/princeofbees/recommended/239200/","princeofbees","Byrd Whyrm","http://steamcommunity.com/id/princeofbees/","274 products in account","I found A Machine for Pigs to be much more horrifying than The Dark Descent, but less terrifying. What I mean by this is that there are substantially fewer moments of white-knuckled terror than in the first Amnesia. Instead, the game is much more about creeping dread and repulsion as the story unfolds. It is a much more focused game, and I have read that the linearity and lack of interaction disappointed a lot of players. I, however, did not mind. In The Dark Descent, very little of what could be interacted with served any purpose, and removing this freedom to interact with useless objects did not bother me. The linearity did not bother me either, because the story was compelling enough to keep me wanting to progress onwards.\nIf what you liked about the first Amnesia was primarily the moment to moment scares, I am hesitant to recommend this game to you, as you may find it disappointing. I would recommend Outlast instead, which has a laughably bad story but excellent atmosphere and scares. If you loved Amnesia due to the Poe-esque or Lovecraftian horror story behind the scares, and the repulsion as you discover what the protagonist has done, then you will most likely love this game. Personally, I found this game to be a superior experience to The Dark Descent, and this is not a statement I make lightly.","December 20, 2013","true","16.9"," 23 of 33 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","23","33","0","1"

You will likely laud it, or hate it.  If you have to look up the word 'laud' in the dictionary, you should probably pass, (or better yet, buy the game and start the processes of understanding nuanced and subtle literature)\n\nYou will probaby enjoy this game if\n- you appreciate enviormental atmosphere\n- you enjoy literature\n- you like horror that builds more on deep issues and less on 'shock' or 'camp' gimmicks\n- you like Dear Esther\n- you want to support developers that are pushing the boundaries on games as a literary medium\n- you enjoy a game with puzzles that feel 'real-world' and don't call attention to themselves or hinder the pace of the\nnarrative\n\nYou will probably not enjoy this game if\n- you don't like not having a gun in your video games\n- you don't enjoy having to do your own critical thinking to come to conclusions concening the story or how it ends\n- you think it will be very similary to The Dark Descent (the game feels much closer to Dear Esther in my opinion)\n- you want something with puzzles that requires you to scratch your nogging\n- you want a horror game where things jump out at you often\n\nIn short, if you value deep narrative experiences in games, and feel familiar with literature and coming to terms with your own underlying meaning, you will find an absolutely matchless gem here.

People literally drown it in pig♥♥♥♥ while other really crappy titles manage to get away. Often the reason why players hate AMFP is that they beleive it's far worse than the original Amnesia. I suggest you should consider these two as completely different games. The Chinese Room (the developer I put highest hopes on and will defend) did their thing. OK, they got rid of core Amnesia gameplay elements (lantern oil, thunderboxes), but I think they did it for the good sake of the story. For story and atmosphere are the basis for Machine For Pigs. Storytelling is just plain dark, almost pitch-black and somewhat Lovecraft-ish as it's predecessor. Game is sophisticated as it is asks global and complex existential questions. Ominous atmosphere is here allright, driven by classy frightening sound desing and music. And YES, this Amnesia is scary - not too scary, but still.. Although it's hard to terrify a Survival Horror vet like me, AAMFP did that. And this what I ♥♥♥♥in' expect from a horror game! Ain't no need to throw ♥♥♥♥ at gamer's face, more of that - no need to drop them off their seats. Freeze them on the spot so they are afraid to move a finger! That's the real horror. And here's the thing some will consider DarkDescent-blasphemy: maybe removing oil tanks, thunderboxes and difficult puzzles was necessary for this particular project, like blinding a man makes his hearing sharper. Cutting the gameplay elements allowed story and setting take the spotlight. IMHO it's better than solving riddle after riddle after riddle in similar tunnels in Penumbra: Overture. Amnesia AMFP isn't an interactive movie though - you do things besides walking. I will however admit it lacks some hard puzzles. And dying. Yeah, I dropped dead TWO (!) TIMES. Anyway, it helped me to percieve the story better. Game's not short too - if you take time and won't charge your ♥♥♥ forward you'll get your healthy 8 hours as I did. To summerize, game's great, all I've expected from the sequel. Dark Descent fans should give it a fair chance, I think. Bare bones of the franchise, huh? Hell of a skeleton then.

That's not to say there isn't any, but much less than Dark Descent.   AMFP goes for it's horror in it's atmosphere and writing, letting your imagination paint the disturbing pictures of what our character has experienced.\n\nSince so much of AMFP story and horror is fleshed out in reading notes it doesn't surprise me that people are giving it so much hate.  It took me 6 hours to finish the game without getting stuck too long on any "puzzle", so when I see people claiming to "beat" it under 3-4 hours it's no wonder they aren't enjoying it.

At the same time, the horror element is somewhat less agravating than in the original installment, which might turn some of the original fans away. I for one was slighty disappointed at first, but steadily got to love the game for its uniqueness.\nThe gameplay is biased towards telling a story, rather than scare the player as was the case with the first game. Thus, there are fewer environmental interractions (aka clicking on objects) and the grueling randomness of the monsters in the first game were replaced with scripted and, most times, less difficult encounters. Furthermore, the overall time needed to finish the game is somewhere at half of the original Amnesia (not taking into account exploring and searching for certain lore items like letters and notes).\nIn conclusion, I can recommend Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs to most players looking for a solid story, intertwined with decent gameplay mechanics as well as a dark and gruesome, yet exceptional envinronment design.","October 11, 2014","true","6.7"," 17 of 26 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","17","26","0","0"

Oddly it wasn't done by the original developers, Frictional, but it was handed off to The Chinese Room who was responsible for Dear Esther. Personally I think its nice to see how a different set of devs would take on the title but not everyone is going to be happy with the outcome.\n\nI will readily admit, I didn't enjoy this game as much and the first Amnesia and that game didn't blow me away either so there are some significant issues with this game. Most noteworthy would be in the gameplay department.\n\nIn the previous title you found yourself looking in every nook and cranny for tinder boxes to light nearby candles and fuel for your lantern. While this wasn't the most exciting thing, it allowed for you to have some kind of purpose as you explored around. As well keeping the lantern from running dry was a source of tension and added to the gameplay. In Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs they removed all resource management, your lantern will never run out and nothing can be found in the environment to aid you. The developers where likely looking to streamline your experience so as to allow for more focus on the plot and the game world but sadly this had a hugely adverse effect for me. I found that without any inventory or items you really lacked a reason to search the environment. A new room was really just a new hallway in the wax museum instead of a place to explore. That sounds harsh, but I just lost motivation to take my time and look around.\n\nPuzzles, puzzles were a large part of the earlier title but again they were practically removed. It can be said that the puzzles in  Amnesia #1 had about the depth of Doom 1 puzzles. By this I mean you entered an area were confronted by a door (or mechanism) preventing you from proceeding, the only way to get passed was to find the key. The key was the sole collectable item in that area so it caused no brainpower besides finding it and inserting it into the door. Yes there are a couple puzzles in Amnesia that had a bit more depth but for the most part they were about on par with Math Circus. So why tone them down? Again they wanted to streamline  the game, make it more accessible and focus more on the plot. Good or bad that's mostly up to the player but since we are talking about video games here the gameplay should stand up for itself a bit, hopefully.\n\nIs it scary? that's honestly the biggest question most people are going to have. The answer is yes, sort of. Its scary but not as tense or even jump scare happy as the other title. Its environments are definitely chilling and there are a few scary encounters but to be honest you really only have to deal with enemies 5 or 6 times throughout the game. Pretty much every time you see an enemy it’s a G-man encounter, if you haven't played half-life that’s to say that it’s a scripted event where an enemy shows up, startles you and then leaves the area. In the rare occasion where there is a patrolling enemy you can you just turn off your lantern and crouch away from him.\n\nSo why did I give this game a recommend. Well its defiantly not for everyone, but this game does have a bunch of things going for it. The environments are terrific. The early 20th century factories and mechanisms are truly creepy and an awesome setting for a game. The atmosphere as a whole is well done. Plot is given to you through letters and diary entrees left about, as well as phone calls(kinda) from a reoccurring character. I found the ending to Amnesia #1 to be a letdown, this game did a bit better with the conclusion I thought.\n\nSo if you are a fan of the first person survival horror genre or Amnesia #1 and want a more streamlined game focused on narrative. Then Amnesia  a Machine for Pigs is right for you. Otherwise you might want to consider waiting for the next game by the original devs. Either way this game is still a decent play though for $15\n\nIf you don’t like the sound of a gameplay lacking survival horror game I would strongly advise checking out Penumbra: Black Plague. Its currently only $5 on steam and is in my opinion the best fps survival horror game out there.","December 21, 2013","true","4.6"," 17 of 26 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","17","26","0","0"

But too many people evaluate A Machine for Pigs on the standard of how similar it is to its predecessor, too afraid to look at it on its own merits. Indeed, there are fewer gameplay elements, such as an infinite lamp duration, easier/fewer puzzles, and an overall lower danger level. But what AMFP has, it does spectacularly. The Chinese Room took a more story-heavy approach and crafted the world around how it's told, and it's a tale well worth hearing. The environments are beautifully constructed, the voicework fits the characters perfectly, and Jessica Curry's music is spectacular. It's like a roller coaster: just because you're not pushing the carts yourself doesn't mean it's not a enjoyable, thrilling ride.\n\nPeople looking for a game that will leave them petrified with fear will be more at home with The Dark Descent.

While I have a sneaking suspicion this may have been due to a large outcry of people 'running out' of light sources in the first game, it might have just been a design choice, who knows. But I do feel that a lot of the tension is removed along with these systems, which is damn a shame.\n\nThe puzzles also suffer due to the lack of an inventory, restricted generally to an immediate component search to fix whatever machine has broken down. At no point is there any real challenge, unlike the first game which I remember had me stumped on at least a couple.\n\nThe use of monsters has also been peeled back in a way. They will run by as means of scaring you initially, later on they serve more to illustrate certain story points. It is actually rather rare to be put in any direct confrontations in this game, and  even rarer that any amount of stealth or hide-and-seek is required. This is the biggest dissapointing aspect for me, as hiding from the monsters in DD was much more pants-♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ scary than just running away from the scripted manpig sequences.\n\nOne thing I think the game improves on is mindgames. I can't be certain, but I'm pretty sure that sometimes an areas makeup, (such as doors or other props) have shifted around (then again, it could have been all in my head, but if so, you can chalk that up to the palpable atmosphere). An early revelation in the mansion is also particularly effective in putting you in the paranoid frame of mind of the protagonist Mandus. Some other unique scares or tricks the game throws at you really helps to mix it up and distinguish it from dark descent.\n\nThe story is pretty interesting, and some of the notes are rather disturbing, or striking, especially with Mandus's own twisted vision of mankind. However don't expect anything spelled out for you, or for there to be some great revelation.\n\nOverall I'd say that the game is well made, if a little dissapointing. Certainly if you enjoyed Amnesia DD, Dear Esther, or even both, you'll definitely find something here. If you hated one or the other, then probably not ;)","September 20, 2013","true","5.1"," 13 of 19 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","13","19","0","0"

Now, into the review. This is a first person linear horror game made by the Chinese Room, and their signatures are all over this game.\n\nThe game is beautifully written, every document fascinating, every bit of dialogue engaging. This game masters immersion, and it simply makes sense. This is not a leap at you horror, it is not jumpscare based, it is not overly gorey (not at first anyway), and it is not overly forward with it's horror. It is more conceptual, and a good amount of the horror is lost to all those who rush through the game without reading the documents. This game makes me think of a lot of eastern horror games, less am onster in your face and more one breathing down your throat, as if the very world was against you. The factory is well crafted, the story is superb, the atmosphere coats you like a blanket and tries to suffocate you in fear. I honestly found this game more scary than A:TTD, and I even played through a second time to find stuff I did not see before.\n\nI do admit, this game is not without it's flaws.  The puzzles of A:TDD are heavily reduced. The puzzles here are straightforward without a lot of wandering about. To me this is great. It makes it a little closer to an interactive novel, but the puzzles of A:TDD mostly just took me out of the game. A:TDD was closer to those old point and click games where you used everything against everything else and got a bit frustrated, removing all the horror. This game has nothing of that, so the fear is able to sink in. It is very "Chinese Room"-y to focus less on the gameplay and more on the story aspects (the world and whatnot). For a more extensive review, here's a link.\n\nAmnesia:AMFP Review[xshadowsaurgaming.wordpress.com]\n\nAll in all I love this game, but I understand the fact it has a limited audience. If you enjoy horror, great story telling, the chinese room, or you're even mildly interested and willing to explore I'd say pick it up. I don't regret ♥♥♥♥♥ing it and I'm certain I'm far from done with it.","May 28, 2014","true","16.3"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Twirkkhu/recommended/239200/","Twirkkhu","Twirkkhu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Twirkkhu/","131 products in account","Holy cow, this game was rad.\n\nThere'll be a handy list of all the pros and cons below if you're into that sort of thing, although it is a bit concise. If you're a patient reader who can handle a crap-ton of text (or an in-depth review, you could say) I wholeheartedly recommend you to tag along.\n\nBefore we begin, I'd like to remind you that this game was not developed by Frictional Games, the developers behind the Penumbra games and The Dark Descent.  This is a collaboration between Frictional and The Chinese Room.  Frictional merely published this game.\n\nThe number one complaint  this game got on release was that "it wasn't as scary as The Dark Descent". Heck, most even said that "it wasn't scary at all".\n\nI completely disagree.  I found this game to be scary,  most definitely so. I don't know how this came to be, but this is definitely how I felt while playing the game. You might already be thinking that I'm a colossal wuss, which I humbly deny, as this is definitely not the first horror game I've played. I went into the game with the same expectations as everyone else, thinking that it's the weakest of Frictional's titles and all that.  So don't be turned off by the fact that others didn't have a scary time with this game.  I surely did.\n\nComplaint number two was directed at the lack of resource management, which has been a core feature of all Frictional's past titles.  This game does not feature an inventory or tinderboxes, and the lantern has infinite fuel. There is also no sanity system and health is regenerated automatically.  People flipped their sh*t when they heard of this, let me tell you. I spent a good thirty minutes looking at the Metacritic user reviews for this game, and they all basically roasted the game for having "dumbed down the gameplay to oblivion" and "taken away the fear of losing light".\n\nI can see the logic behind both of these arguments, especially the latter. The former just seems silly. I actually didn't like the resource management in The Dark Descent that much, as tinderboxes were way too common and oil was really hard to find. I felt restricted because I didn't want to waste any oil. Infinite fuel seemed like a godsend if anything. Despite this, the game wasn't too bright at all, I'd say it was the opposite.\n\nThe monsters were also a dissapointment for most people,  and I actually kind of agree on this one. I'm not saying they weren't scary, because they were (they're monsters for a reason, duh). They just weren't "as scary". One of the major cons I would personally give this game is the  terror meter/chase theme . Perhaps one of the most iconic pieces of audio in Frictional's games are the terror meters, which are basically the monsters' chase themes. Not only do they indicate that the monster has begun its hunt and that you should haul a**, they are a critical factor in maintaining the suspense of the chase. I'm sure everyone remembers the diabolical screeching  in The Dark Descent, as it was easily distinguishable and altogether terrifying. SOMA had multiple, one for each monster type, all of which were f*cking terrifying as well.  A Machine for Pigs' chase theme, when compared to the others, is a pretty big miss.  It's basically machine noises. And when you take into consideration that you will be near machinery for a big part of the game, the mistake becomes clear. One time I had literally no idea that I was being hunted, just because the chase theme was so quiet and indistinguishable from the ambience. The chases were still pretty scary, but definitely lost some of the terror that the other games had.\n\nLet's now look at some things that people actually liked, for once.\n\nThe story is definitely one of the major things A Machine for Pigs got right.  The Chinese Room as a developer has their focus set on story-driven games, and it shows. The story is such an improvement from The Dark Descent's, which I found to be quite dull and it didn't catch my interest.  As this is a story-driven game at heart, you absolutely must tag along with it and pay attention to the notes and dialogue.  The writing is stellar, and the notes were a blast to read. I wouldn't say that the story reaches SOMA's level of excellence, but it's great nonetheless.\n\nFrictional's titles all possess brilliant sound design, and this is no exception.  The overall audio is great, especially the voice acting. The composer isn't our beloved Mikko Tarmia this time, but Jessica Curry still managed to make an epic score suitable for a horror game like this.\n\nI haven't seen many people talking about the environments, actually. I thought that the overall milieu was certainly more interesting than in The Dark Descent. I didn't really like TDD's trite castle setting, so I eagerly awaited what this game had to offer. After my first hour with the game I was already very happy with the choice they made. As a big fan of steampunk, I found the environments quite pleasing.\n\nI guess I've covered it all now, so here's the promised list for the impatient.\n\nPROS\n\nStory is brilliant and a huge improvement over The Dark Descent's.\nSetting was especially pleasing to me. (Steampunk environments are fun.)\nOverall audio is great. (Do it justice and use headphones, please.)\nYes, it can actually be scary. I went into it with the same expectations as everyone else, and still got scared plenty.\n\nTHE NEUTRAL STUFF, I GUESS\n\nInventory is gone. (I actually didn't mind it at all.)\nInfinite light. (People are still flipping their sh*t over this. I actually like this change, f*ck resource management.)\nLess objects to throw...? (I don't care, neither should you.)\nNo sanity system. (I actually don't like that you can look at the enemy all you want, but it's better than getting lasting effects from it. SOMA did this right by disrupting your vision only when you look at the damn things.)\n\nCONS\n\nThe monsters aren't as scary. (They're still scary, not just  as  scary.)\nThe terror meter. (a.k.a the monster chase theme. It's very quiet and indistinguishable from the ambience, and not very scary at all.)\nA tad short when compared to the other games. Took me seven hours to beat, but it can be easily beaten in five.\nSummary\n\nI still don't understand why people are so mad about this game. The things that they took away from this sequel aren't really that significant, and I found the changes to be quite good. The story is a huge improvement over the last game's. And yes, the game can still be scary, especially if you play it in a proper environment (at night, in the dark and with headphones. This is how every horror game should be played, for goodness' sake!).\n\nI honestly thought this was a worthy sequel. Such a shame that everyone seemed to dislike it.","May 15","true","7.1"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","80","8","10","3","4"

Let's establish that above all else. However, we should move into what makes it incredible.\n\nThe story is amazing; unlike anything I've ever seen before. I cannot stress this enough. It's bizarre. It's odd. It's unsettling. Above all, it's deep. It's dramatic. The story is dark, and easily one of the top three original stories I've ever come across. This is coming from someone who avidly reads Stephen King.\n\nThe atmosphere: where do I begin? It feels dark, gloomy, hopeless, sad, eerie, underlyingly sinister. While there aren't necessarily monsters around every corner, there is something else: a clue. There are hints scattered within the entire game about what's really going on. These come in the form of not only journal entries, but paintings, blood stains, architectual designs, and decorative mediums. If you put thought into the reasonings for layouts, placed items, etcetera, they'll do more than spook you once you figure out the justification for it. Nearly nothing in the environment is placed randomly.\n\nSIde note: I'd really like to talk about the writing in the game for a bit. First, the journals. The journals reveal so very much about what's going on in the story. They reveal secrets that are not otherwise concluded or mentioned in the game, and do require thought to figure out why they're there. Also, they're not necessarily out in the open; you'll have to search for them a bit.\nSecondly, the dialogue. The dialogue is SO beautifull crafted. The monologues are incredible, heart-felt, deep, meaningful, and thought-provoking (not to mention the wonderful voice-acting). The dialogue is one of the major things that pumps such vivid life into this piece of art.\nTo sum up these two paragraphs, the journal entries and diologue are nearly poetry. They're beautiful.\n\nIt's been said in other reviews, but I'll say it again: if you're looking for jump scares, this is not your game. At all. Let me repeat that. IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR JUMP SCARES, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.\nOn the contrary, if you're looking for  an incredible experience, a wonderfully crafted story, a bizarre, unique atmosphere, and you appreciate looking for meaning, this game is for you. ENGLISH TEACHERS OR APPRECIATERS OF ART OF ANY KIND, STOP READING AND BUY. IT'S INCREDIBLY WORTH IT. Better thana the majority of 'meaningful' movies to have come out recently.\n\nAbout the gameplay: yes, as you've probably read, there is no oil. There is no insanity meter. There is no constant danger. Don't expect there to be. The reasoning for this is that you're supposed to be enjoying the environment, not scavanging through it looking for survival tools. There are also no mind-bending puzzles. You may get stumped for a bit (I know I did), but you will persevere.\nAlso, I'd like to mention that this game is not meant to be rushed through. You're meant to take your time. Do this by examining each room. Examine each detail. Read each journal entry and put thought into it. FIgure out why what's there is there. Make justifications, BE THE DETECTIVE! It's called Amnesia because you're supposed to figure out what happened. Please acknowledge this.\n\nThe game has a mature rating. Yes, there is slight strong language and gore, a bit of nudity as well. However, the main reason to stick to the 17+ rating is that the story isn't meant for anyone younger. The story is meant to be taken very seriously, as a drama. The majority of younger players will not appreciate the artistic value that lies in this game, simply because most are not yet mature enough.\n\nI recommend this game. I recommend it very, VERY highly. I don't leave reviews for things often. But especially with the mixed reviews this game has gotten, it needs to be justified and given the credit it so greatly deserves. 10/10, I don't think there's a single thing this game could have dont better. I mean this from the very bottom fo my heart.\n\nEnjoy the game.","December 26, 2014","true","7.8"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

It's quite obvious that a lot went into the multiple environments and the dark levels. It looks brilliant and it feels great, you can stand there and soak up all the detail in each individual level. The story is utterly brilliant, it’s dark and somewhat surprising, if this game would to be made into a book, and it would be a damn good one. It’s immersive (the story) and it’s one of the kind of stories that don’t really start from ‘A’ to ‘B’ but it’s one of those stories where you’re caught somewhere between ‘A’ and ‘B’ and you pick it up along the way. It may seem like a good game, right? Well…\n\nOn the downside, most of us were expecting a scare right? Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs sadly falls short of that department. The A.I aren’t as scary as the one’s in the first, they don’t seem to be ‘hunting’ you, most of the time they’re just shuffling along past you looking pretty for the spotlight. On that note, the monsters look brilliant, but personally are a little stupid. Most of the interactive environment as we see in Amnesia: The Dark Descent is taken away so we’re given more of an immersive experience (This has its upsides and downsides.) Also, this makes the game more of a ‘rail’ where you are lead most of the way to the end and it’s not as tempting to go find hidden items/secrets because there's really nothing to find, besides the main path. Also, the Inventory is taken away as well as the first Amnesia’s famous Sanity Bar, which on the plus side leaves us with fewer things to worry about, but sort of takes away the risk of it all.\n\nDon’t get me wrong, the game is fantastic in story, and graphics, but falls woefully short in what most of us came to this game for: the fear. Personally, if this game were to have ‘Amnesia’ taken out of the title, and only left with ‘A Machine for Pigs’ as a stand-alone game. Then this game would be very unique and fantastic, but as a sequel to the first Amnesia, it doesn’t do so well.\n\nPersonal Gaming Score:\n6/10\n\nHighly recommend this game for those wanting an immersive story/environment or those looking for a great game to play, but a bit of a disappointment for those looking for a scary game or came here from the first game.","January 20, 2014","true","4.9"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","6"

I was amazed at the amount of ineractivity, even if there was no reason for it. I loved the puzzles, and the fact that sometimes the sulotion was as simple and as frustrating as smashing open a power box with a brick I found on the floor.\nThere was a definite story improvement as the Penumbra series went on, and I was also impressed with Amnesias storytelling, and effects on the player and their mental health.\n\nHowever, A Machine For Pigs lost me. Most of the world was non-interactive, i never had to move things out of the way to look behind them, the puzzles just seemed to be, can you get this simple thing. There was no patterns that I had to solve, or mental puzzles that had to be thought out, or even things that I could get lucky on, it just all seemed to mainstream simple to me. The effects on the players mental health etc only took place for short bursts, and mostly just made you unable to move. Felt much more like a classic movie horror, then an actually scary puzzle game.\nDon't get me wrong here, if you let yourself be scared, you still will be.\nIt did have some of the good elements, like not quite letting you see the scary thing on the other side of that wall, and the audio (recommend headphones) was as always terrifying. However the other missing elements stopped me from being fully emersed in the game.\nI tried going back to the game a few times, hoping that the old style would return after the introduction section, but I am sad to say that it didn't.\n\nI will continue to admire the original author for what he created before, but I can't see myself buying the next game if this is the direction it is taking.\nI will however, highly recommend all the previous titles, I even bought copies of a few for friends.\nAnd to be direct, i played the first amnesia for free, then bought it because it was worth the money. Then I bought Penumbra.\n\nIf the author is taking feedback, here are my suggestions:\n1. Return to interactivity, make the objects in the world pick-upable, they can move, and can be pushed by other objects, but not picked up.\n2. make the puzzles hard again, I know you can make more money by creating simplistic puzzles for the common player, but it just defeats the game.\n3. Bring back the horror, instead of having "horror" cut scenes, bring back the character getting scared of things even if they have seen them before,\n\nThere also needs be other options for "would you reccomend this game" I Can't decide, I am saying no though, purely compared to the previous games.\nHowever I would also recommend this game, it was worth playing, it just wasn't compared to the previous games.\nI will try to finish this game if I can, one last time, before I give up on it.","January 21, 2014","false","0.8"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","1"

Maybe if I had paid full price during its initial release with high expectations I would have been let down but in the end I thought it was a good game.\n\nTo be sure, it's not as good as the first one. With the first game I actually had to stop at various points because I was too nervous to progress into a darkened area. There's only one scene in this one where I felt close to that level of scared. This game simply isn't as horrifying this time around. It's also a considerably shorter, more streamlined experience -- there's less interactivity, puzzles, etc.\n\nAnother thing that disappoints me was the lack of a custom story option. The original Amnesia has hours and hours of replay value that this does not because of it. The game is different enough than the original that there's potential for a number of custom stories using the elements present here.\n\nOn the positive side, the game is still an effective and atmospheric experience. I would stay the story is stronger this time around. The protagonist Oswald Mandus plays a much bigger part in his own story than Daniel did in the first one and as such his his character arc is more rewarding in my opinion. The game's world is beautiful and haunting to look at; I stopped several times just to take in the scenery. I normally don't talk about music in games but Jessica Curry's soundtrack really adds to the story.\n\nThe developers had the unenviable task of following up 'The Dark Descent' and to their credit they took a risk as opposed to simply copying the formula of the original. Not all of it works but I still have to applaud their efforts.\n\nIf you're all hesitant I would wait until this is on sale but I do recommend you try it out at least once.","July 2, 2015","true","9.1"," 11 of 17 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","11","17","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jaedraven/recommended/239200/","Jaedraven","Raven","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jaedraven/","112 products in account","Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs is a psychological thriller created as the sequel to the first game, Amnesia: The Dark Descent. Although the game plays somewhat like the first installment, it is actually a very different game in terms of storytelling and jump scares. Let me just say, if you are going into this game expecting the same experience as the first, you will be disappointed.\n\nA Machine for Pigs takes place in the late 1800’s after the industrial revolution, and the world has been modernized. Gone is the need for lantern oil, and tinderboxes, as your new lantern never runs out of battery power. Sanity is also apparently not an issue any longer and you won’t have to deal with any inventory screens either. The story itself is a long twisting tale of a tortured man who has done some pretty awful things. His journey to reclaim his troubled memories is a journey through the mind of a man driven to the brink of insanity from the overbearing weight of emotional loss. Determined to correct his mistakes and set everything right, he finds himself on the precipice of his own destruction.\n\nAs for gameplay, the traditional Amnesia style of solving puzzles shines through as the player will need to solve many throughout the game by interacting with the environment around them. The sound is, of course, another compliment to the Amnesia series, and gives the player that same sense that they are being followed continuously by something… or someone.\n\nThere are a couple chase sequences and moments where the player will be required to hide in the darkness to avoid detection, but the monsters themselves seem to be rather linear and will appear and run off in a preplanned route many times throughout the game. Most people were disappointed with the monsters as they don’t actually bust down doors and search for you like they did in the original Amnesia. Basically, if you avoid them then they will avoid you. But that does not mean it isn’t scary, the atmosphere of the game is incredibly creepy and there is barely any warning as to when a monster is in the area.\n\nMy overall score for the game: 8/10. This game is worth playing for the story alone. Go into this game as ‘A Machine for Pigs’ and not ‘Amnesia.’ As a game of its own, it is great and worth checking out. But if you are looking for the same horror experience as the original Amnesia, skip this one and try out Soma.\n","May 19","true","10.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

It's more accurate to say that, according to Steam, I have played 28 minutes of Amnesia: The Dark Descent. That includes times spent setting up options in the menu. So in reality, I've gotten far enough that the first strong gust of wind howled through a corridor before I quit. I'd like to say that's because I didn't like the controls. Admittedly, I do prefer gamepads to mouse and keyboard, but the atmospheric elements of Amnesia: TDD kinda scared me.\n\nAmnesia: A Machine For Pigs recently went on sale for 66% off on Steam, so I decided to roll the dice. It does, for the record, support gamepads. As far as the technical aspects of the game, Frictional teamed with The Chinese Room, creators of Dear Esther (developer of 2008's popular First Person Walking Simulator Dear Esther). It's got a fairly hefty options menu, and the game looks gorgeous (when you can see it).  It ran well on my GTX770, and once I'd nailed down a particularly nasty case of screen tearing (disable in-game Vsync, both regular and adaptive, and enable it in the Nvidia Control Panel or your ATI equivalent), the game ran at a smooth 60 FPS with no screen tearing. The gamepad controls were responsive and simple to learn, and even the object manipulation mechanic of the first game translated well from mouse to thumbsticks.\n\nThis is not an overly complex game, though. It's pedigree shows through, as many sources have said that this game is far simpler in its gameplay mechanics than the previous Amnesia title. Your lantern has unlimited oil. There are no items to pick up, no laudanum to keep you sane. Your character is obviously far more mentally stable, seeing as the monsters in this game doesn't affect your ability to cope with the world around you.\n\nWhere A Machine For Pigs really shines is its storytelling. You wake up in a caged bedroom of a properly posh Victorian mansion, and bits of story are slowly fed to you throughout your descent (a dark one!) into the heart of a Steampunk monstrosity of brass tubes, gears, pistons, and oh-so-many nauseating swine carcasses. Like many dark horror stories, there are aspects that fall apart if you look at it too closely, but the game wraps up before most people have time to question those aspects. The game runs about 4 to 4 and a half hours, but that's a tight 4 and a half hours, with very few wasted moments, and a hectic (if overly obviously scripted) sequence later in the game where the monsters really come into play. Overall, it's dripping (quite literally at times) with atmosphere\n\nIs it worth the usual $20 price tag? That's all going to depend on whether you're a big horror buff. Personally, I'm not. That I only paid < $7 for the game, goes a long way to my personal valuation. I feel I got my money's worth, even though it didn't quite hit that “dollar-per-hour” magic mark.

The atmosphere is quickly set by the story introduction, but sadly it couldn't keep that atmosphere all the way through. The flair of Amnesia is the feeling that you can't fight whatever is after you, sneaking around and hiding are your only way to survive. In Machine for Pigs this mechanic is less pronounced. I felt like the enemies weren't that treatening, I felt like I could run, like I could beat them. This is notthe feeling that creates terror (something that I expect from a game in the horror genre). Overall I wouldn't recommend Machine for Pigs.","October 21, 2014","false","2.6"," 22 of 39 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","22","39","0","0"

For starters, it was a rather short game especially being the same $20 price as the first Amnesia game, which consited of much more playtime. The storyline was father boring and consited of a very predictable plot twist towards the end. Enemy encouters were hard to come by and usually lasted only a couple seconds along with being really easy to avoid. They removed the inventory, sanity feature, oil, tinderboxes, as well as the ability to interact with items in the environment. From other reviews read along with conversations in forums it appears the game also consits of capability issues making it hard for some people to even be able to play the game.

The story focuses on Mandus, a wealthy industrialist from the late 19th century who wakes up with, well, Amnesia. His intention is to find his children who are no where to be found.\n\nThe atmosphere in Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs (AMFP) is always spooky and unsettling. There is never a moment where you don't apprehend something scary happening. I suppose this could be argued to be a disadvantage. The environments are both visually good looking and interesting and always kept me staring at things.\n\nI personally believe that AMFP does not live up to Amnesia: The Dark Descent(TDD). Although AMFP kept me on my toes for most of the game, I feel that there are some integral things missing. Those which made TDD a truly brilliant horror game.\nFirst of all, the monsters. Probably the most important element in a horror game, the monsters are the beings which make you fear every door opening and puzzle completion. The monsters in AMFP were not terribly frightening as those in TDD. There is something about human form monsters being scarier than animal form monsters, in the sense that I suppose we can relate to human form monsters, rather than animal form. By human form I mean stand up straight on two legs, like the monsters in TDD. The monsters in TDD are horrific because of their disfigured bodies, especially The Grunt. As for the telsa pig...well... I found it to be a bit silly.\n\n"You can look, but you can't touch" - If you know what this is, then you know what is coming next... Interaction. An important concept from TDD. But, it was completely removed in AMFP, apart from a few essential things required to progress through the story. This was... dissapointing. I loved the aspect in TDD. Picking up books and looking at them made the game even more immersive. The fact that this is not present in AMFP seems a bit...lazy. Yes I said it. The Chinese Room were very aware that this was an important concept in TDD and yet failed to implement it properly in AMFP.\n\nAnother important point that may seem trivial to some, is the absence of "Danger close monster music". The monster music in TDD was brilliantly composed. The truly chilling and terrifying music, that played when a monster was near, rang in my mind after playing TDD. I think that it would have been an excellent addition to AMFP if this was implemented. Although, when a monster is near in AMFP, the absence of music is still fairly scary. Also...the flickering lamp concept. Just seems like it ruins the point of a horror game, being warned that something scary is approaching.\n\nOK, rant over.\nAmnesia: A Machine for Pigs is a fantastic game, don't get me wrong. It just seems like it could be better. It is a very disturbing game that focuses on a distrurbing and strong story.\n\nIf you enjoyed Amnesia: The Dark Descent, then you may be a little disappointed by AMFP, but none the less, you will enjoy this game for what there is. So try to avoid comparing if to TDD because the truth is that it is not as good, but it is still enjoyable.","December 11, 2013","true","11.4"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","9","14","0","0"

It's not scary. There's so much "poetry" it's just pretentious. There aren't any difficult sneaking stages or even any good puzzles.

It is a good horror game overall and the concept is interesting. The story is very messed up, but comparing this to The Dark Descent feels like a bit of an insult. The TAB inventory is gone, your lantern doesn't need any sort of resource to work, so you can just use it all the time. It flashes sometimes in an attempt to scare you, but failed for me. Survival elements are pretty much gone! You have about 5 encounters with enemies throughout the game, but that isn't exactly a negative thing...\n\nI was shocked with how linear this game felt - the puzzles were too easy, and the atmosphere isn't even half good as the previous game. It's also a very short game taking me 3.5 hours to beat (not speedrunned). As I was saying, linear is the best I can describe A Machine for Pigs. You can't pick up / grab most of the objects to have some fun like you could in the previous game. When you do, you can be almost sure that said object will be used for a less-than-challenging puzzle.\n\nJessica Curry did a good job on composing the soundtrack. It is actually well-executed but not as panic-inducing or creepy as TDD. The concept art is great and the looks are pretty much like The Dark Descent. Not many graphical improvements are seen but it's still a good looking game.\n\nThe verdict: Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs is a good horror game, but not *that* good compared to the first Amnesia. To be honest, I was only scared about twice through the whole game, and I am a coward Nemesis in what comes to horror. It's a bit overpriced for a four hour experience, and I consider this a slightly wasted potential, because story-wise, it is better than the first one. If you're interested in it, wait until it goes on sale. After all, I still had a great time exploring 1899's London and what lies beneath it! Come here piggy, piggy!\n\nToo long, didn't read?

The Dark Descent filled me with horrors and left me with many sleepless nights. It was and still is in my opinion, the best horror game ever made. Amnesia A Machine for Pigs placed me in the shoes of the wealthy Oswald Mandus, another Amnesiac like Daniel. Like its predocessor, the game successfully builds tension unlike any other. I was terrifyed as I opened any door for fear of what lurked on the other side. The story surpasses The Dark Descent's, and the game has one of the best soundtracks I have ever had the pleasure of hearing. The Sanity Meter is gone, which saddened me, and I no longer had to scavenge for Landanum and Oil for my lantern. And then there's the monsters. I won't spoil anything, but when I did encounter them, even though they are terrifying, the soundtrack didn't distort and the screen didn't blurr, which was one of my favourite things about the original. Even though the game was stripped of these mechanics, Amnesia A Machine for Pigs was still an inticing and thoroughly engrossing experience. I highly reccomend it to fans of the original and horror fans in genreal. Amnesia A Machine for Pigs isn't the kind of horror you may be expecting, but it's a welcome change that stands out from many other horror games, and it has and will stick with me for a long time.","January 7, 2014","true","6.9"," 10 of 16 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","10","16","0","0"

You play as Oswald Mandus, a rich industrialist who awakens at the beginning of the game in his mansion with no memory of his recent past. It seems the he has lost his two sons and his wife is may be dead. There is something very strange going down with regard to pigs in and around his home and adjacent factory. You move through the ominous mansion in first person, piecing together your troubled past courtesy of notes, the odd entry in your journal, sound recordings that play on Victrola-like devices and even telephone conversations with a mysterious man who may have your children held captive in the bowels of the factory.\nYou guide Mandus through the game, you will often face problems that need solving in order to progress. Most of the time you will just have to pull a level or two, sometimes having to retrace your steps in order to find the item that goes into the item-shaped hole. This all sounds very basic, and it is.\nIn the previous game, Amnesia: The Dark Descent, players had to carefully manage the oil in their lamps, while also attempting to maintain their sanity. A Machine for Pigs abandons this gameplay mechanic entirely. You have a lamp, with unlimited power and any notion of turning insane, simply is not present.\nWith unlimited supplies, players are free to explore without hindrance; a feature which will make some players happy and others not so much. Those who enjoyed the sense of fear and pressure evoked when running low on supplies in The Dark Descent, will find A Machine for Pigs a little disappointing in this respect.\nThere are tons of creepy sounds throughout the game and a lot of great music too, some of it is beautiful and haunting, while some is very creepy and vile.\nA Machine for Pigs has increased graphics compared to The Dark Decent, but it has less gameplay features that made the game easier and also the survival horror aspect is reduced compared to the first “Amnesia”.\nAll in all, I can still say that Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs is a game that all horror fans should play. The soundtrack alone will make most people feel fear, with the visuals and gameplay certainly not taking much away from the experience.\n\nSounds 10/10\nGraphics 8/10\nGameplay 5/10\nAtmosphere 7/10\n\nIf you liked my review, please feel free to follow me and/or my curator group:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/id/Ov3RT4K3R/myworkshopfiles/?section=guides\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/orcollective#curation","December 26, 2013","true","8.1"," 33 of 61 people (54%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","54","33","61","0","0"

Hmmm...\n\nIt certainly has a rival for the scariest SOUNDTRACK for a game ever (the load screens alone filled me with more dread than most so-called "horror" games)!  And it's definitely in the running for the most "sinister" game ever (my much-beloved Silent Hill series being the closest competitors herein).\n\nBut more than anything, I would say this possibly emerges as the single most "oppressive" video game ever.  Put it this way:  If you're in any way claustrophobic and/or unnerved by the near-constant humming, banging, clanging, hissing and clattering of machinery...then you may be in for a somewhat stressful experience.  And if you in any way harbour a phobia of PIGS, then suffice it to say you're SCREWED.  Even the squeaky doors grunt like pigs when you open them.  This game sets up a near-relentless atmosphere of being trapped in a nightmare you can't escape, at least as well as any game before it, and possibly then some.  I personally found I had to muster a certain amount of "courage" up just to commit to a session of gameplay.  Let's just say you gotta be in "the mood"...\n\nA further warning though:  For those who vastly prefer busy "gameplay" elements over story, this may not be the game for you.  This one is almost ALL about story, though evidently not as much as The Chinese Room's previous is-it-or-isn't-it-a-game experience, Dear Esther.  Sure, there's a bit of (not-TOO-challenging) machinery-based puzzle-solving, and a few scenes where you'll be running for your dear life not even knowing what the hell is chasing you (but daring not to look back, at any cost!)...yet the JOURNEY is what this game is all about, just as Esther was...just with a little more action along the way.  All in all though, anyone who got anything out of Esther, and not to mention the first Amnesia, is unlikely to be disappointed by this overly successful mating of its two spiritual predecessors.\n\n(An afterthought:  Should I be concerned about the degree to which I sympathised with the game's more, erm, "anti-social" themes?  I'm not even sure I entirely agree with the protagonist's last-ditch attempts to "redeem" himself in the last few chapters.  "Kill them, my little piggies!

Some people hate it, while others adore it.\n\nAmnesia: A Machine for Pigs was developed by thechineseroom, the same people who brought us Dear Esther. I'm personally not fond of Dear Esther myself, but that is for another review.\n\nThe gameplay is probably the biggest difference between the two games. In A Machine for Pigs, the game is much more linear than The Dark Descent. There are not many areas to explore, as most of the areas require you to finish the puzzle and continue your way on. Personally this did not bother me very much, however if you are a hardcore Amnesia fan this might upset you. The game has very few items to grab and fool around with; mostly items required for the path are the only items that can be grabbed. A Machine for Pigs removes the inventory, which automatically removes all aspects of obtainable items.\n\nThe monsters in A Machine for Pigs are much different from The Dark Descent in many ways. It is clear they are from a different type of horror, being The Dark Descent monsters much more scary. The ManPigs in A Machine for Pigs are not scary to the extent the monsters are in The Dark Descent; however some monsters later in the game might sway ones opinion. I will not go into detail of the monsters to reveal any spoilers.\n\nPossibly the most obvious change from The Dark Descent is the setting. The Dark Descent took place during the 1800’s in a castle, while A Machine for Pigs takes place during the last hours of 1899 of London. All of the scenery is replaced with early 20th century buildings and machinery, with the end result looking spot on for the appropriate time frame.\n\nA Machine for Pigs sadly is not very user friendly in the custom story department, as the game has no support for custom stories.  If you own The Dark Descent, you can head over to Frictional Games’ forum to obtain the pre-release of an upcoming update for The Dark Descent to utilize the new model format (.FBX) from A Machine for Pigs.\n\nOverall opinion: A Machine for Pigs was scary, but not scary enough. That being said, the story is fantastic and much better than The Dark Descent in many ways. Without reading the notes, the player might become confused what happened in the story. If you are a fan of Amnesia and of pigs, this title is for you. If you didn’t find A Machine for Pigs scary, try The Dark Descent. If you think either one of those are not scary, try out the Penumbra series created by Frictional Games. Penumbra might change your opinion quickly.\n\nLink for pre-release update for The Dark Descent: http://frictionalgames.com/forum/thread-23378.html\n","December 23, 2013","true","7.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

No, the art was fine. Assume that every other element of the work fails. if that promise of art and atmosphere is still enough for you, stop reading this review and go on and buy it.\n\nBut once you've had your fill of the art, what's left is plot, and the plot, the thrust of the game, is totally craftless.\nAs is standard for amnesia, you discover partway through that you're supposedly someone who's done terrible things. The problem with that is the game spends the first three quarters letting you operate under the assumption that you are not that person, and developing an in-universe identity who's done nothing but try to protect his children. So, when the game tells you that you did something baffling and awful and there is blood on your hands, that you built a hell machine and oiled it with the blood of men, yes you, the person who probably baught this game because you were attracted to its strong anti-industrialist themes, this is the emotional reaction almost all players are going to have in light of this revelation:\n\nNo. No, I didn't do any of that. My hands are clean, and none of this has any relevance to me. I am not even slightly invested in the role.\n\nAnd it really is all totally irrelevant to you because, as in The Dark Descent, the very empty explanation as to why our player character did these things seems to reduce to the influence of some black box alien artifact. You know, something that's explicitly not trying to analogize any real-world system, past, present or speculative future. Even if you were, against pragmatism, curious about this thin fictional construct, the game gives you basically no information.\n\nDespite the familiarity of the industrial distopean setting, none of it is meaningful (beyond the premise itself, which is great, but that is conveyed in full by the cover text). It is not a commentary, or if it is, its angle is deliberately obfuscated. Not in a fun way. In a "there's no hint that there is any thematic puzzle here to be solved" way. If you think Dan Pinchbeck has said something meaningful, you could just as well be imagining it.","November 10, 2015","false","5.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

The protagonist's flaccid spaghetti arms have wasted away on a diet of pork, a noble sacrifice of a singular engineer, which would go far in explaining the lack of inventory and the immutable static environments, or his unwillingness to carry any of the weapons that are scattered around the complex. Perhaps this also explains the cataracts and his befuddled amnesiac mind.

Despite the fact that it was developed by a different group and has a completely different setting, I was expecting to have a very similar experience. While the beginning was very similar, as the game progressed it diverged in many ways, and not all of them were bad.\n\nUnlike the first game, the player character has a very specific goal from the beginning: find his children. At first I thought that he hadn't lost all of his memories, but as the story progressed it became clear that he didn't know how the machinery around him worked, even though he was clearly the one who had built it.\n\nLighting is very important, and just like the original you get a lantern to light your way. However, this lantern never runs out of juice, and spending time in the darkness doesn't affect your character's sanity. I found this very odd, because it was one of the main sources of tension and fear in the first game. As it turns out, A Machine for Pigs is much more about the story it has to tell than it is about scaring your pants off.\n\nThe story starts off slowly, when the game is still at its scariest. It then builds into an arch that I don't want to say anything about because it would be very easy to spoil and it really is the strong point of the game.\n\nThe themes surprisingly focused heavily on the class struggle of the late 1800s, and utilized pigs as the metaphors and imagery for almost everything. In a way it reminds me of the social commentary that Bioshock gave, but a much smaller taste.\n\nThe gameplay was a lot simpler than the first game. Most of the tasks that I had to complete wouldn't even count as puzzles, they were that straightforward. It probably helped that most objects that were interactable were puzzle elements. For example, I once found a candle that I could pick up; suspecting that there was a puzzle coming up that required it, I brought it with me. I was right. A lot of the drawers and doors had these huge visible locks on them that clearly meant "You cannot open this, there is nothing useful inside, and the developers don't want you wasting all of your time opening tons of drawers because there isn't any health or sanity for you to worry about. Just move along and continue the story we have crafted for you."\n\nOne of the creepiest things in the game were these colorful pigmasks. They would show up in areas that I had already explored, and occasionally disappear again while I wasn't looking. It gave me the sensation that I was being watched. I also suspect that they sometimes changed the map around me, similar to Antichamber but much less obvious. Or maybe I just got myself lost.\n\nOddly, there were several things in the game that reminded me of Portal 2. In many areas there were large maps of the complex with the area I was in highlighted so I could tell how close to my goal I was.\n\nThere was also this one walkway that would have fit right in among the older parts of Aperture Science.\n\nA Machine for Pigs was a very well-made narrative, and it moved me deeply. However, it was extremely short at 4.5 hours long. I would price this game at $10, so wait until it goes on sale.","October 12, 2013","true","4.7"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

I truly believe it was fantastic.\n\nIt is definitely different than The Dark Descent, but it engaged me just as strong as the original did along with terrifying me in new ways.\n\nThe level design,story, atomosphere, lighting, and sound all come together to create a world that is disturbing, frightening, forbidding, and at the same time compelling. I was terrified to continue exploring, but I was too curious not too. I needed to know what was going on. I NEEDED to know, who the main character was, what had happened to his family, and what this massive machine truely was.\n\nOnce I began my descent into this machine, I felt the horror and mystery begin to dig their icy claws into my soul.\n\nThe Dark Descent gained most of its terror from the atmosphere and its monsters trying to kill you. Here it is what the atmosphere, main character, story, monsters, and surroundings, and what they representthat is so terrifying. It is also a strong exploration into the mind of a madman, as he tries to atone for his mistakes and come to terms with the horrible things he has done.\n\nOnce I had begun to unravel the story, where the pigs came from, the main character's past, the machine's purpose, and what it all represented to me, I experienced a style of terror and horror that I have not felt since Silent Hill 2.\n\nA Machine for Pigs is NOT The Dark Descent. It has a much stronger stoyr focus, simplified gameplay, and completely different ways of horrigying you, so if you go into this expecting The Dark Descent 2, then you may be disappointed.\n\nIf you wanted another Dark Descent, then go play The Dark Descent. I however, don't like when horror games stay in the same area too long (I'm looking at you resident evil) but a true way to expand upon horror is to approach it in new ways.\n\nA Machine for Pigs does this, and it does it damn well.\n","September 21, 2013","true","3.7"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","1"

Im not too sure what to say about AAMFP. I, being a huge fan of TDD, had been looking into this game since it was announced. The idea of the game really got me pumped up, and the lack of real information made me even more excited about its release. The amount of delays was really upsetting though. The game (I think) was originally set to release in October 2012 (Again, Im not sure), but was released in September 2013. When the game showed up on Steams store page, I instantly bought it for pre-load. On the day it came out, I instantly got out of bed, started up my PC and started playing. In short, it was one of the most dissapointing things ever. For starters, Custom Story was taken off. That part really upset me. Gameplay wise, there is now no inventory system, no tender boxes, and unlimited oil, taking away greatly from the survival horror feel. Also, the Insanity system was removed. When a monster is seen, it doesnt give the insanity effect that was seen in TDD. Story wise, I thought they had something going. I liked the idea of the story. It is one of the main reasons I got excited for the game in the first place. But like a lot of the other reviews are saying, it is like a toned down versoin of TDD. Im not saying that its the worst game ever made or anything. I just thing that maybe, just maybe, if Frictional Games was the only one who worked on this, it could be a little bit better.

You play as Oswald Mandus, a wealthy English businessman and a loving father, who has recently returned from a trip to Mexico. Sick and feverish, Mandus is startled awake in the middle of the night by the sound of his children calling out for him. Following the echoes of their voices, Mandus enters the cellar of his house. If only he knew what he would discover down in the depths.\n\nA Machine for Pigs is probably best described as an indirect sequel to The Dark Descent, and though it shares the Amnesia name, the developers are not the same, and jumping in with the expectations of it being the same game will only leave you disappointed. A Machine for Pigs is by no means a bad game, but it certainly is different from its predecessor.\n\nGameplay-wise, the most noticeable changes are the many elements that are absent compared to The Dark Descent, most notably the sanity meter and inventory. Rather than picking up items and combining them to solve puzzles, you instead must physically carry around anything that you need, and can only hold one item at a time. While this does make for much simpler puzzles overall, it also makes the game feel more immersive. There's no pausing to combine items while a monster chases you down, everything is real-time. Other than those changes, however, the game plays just like Frictional's previous games.\n\nAtmosphere is a large and critical element in any horror game, and few developers know atmosphere better than The Chinese Room, most well-known for their game Dear Esther. As you travel from your cozy mansion, to the graveyard of the church, to the industrial bowels of the Machine, the atmosphere is persistent, realistic and very intense. The monsters, though there are relatively few that pose a real threat to you, are gruesome and terrifying, and the infamous Amnesia invisible water monster even makes a return in a new form.\n\nHowever, where A Machine for Pigs truly excels is in the story. Like The Dark Descent, you start out knowing very little about yourself and your surroundings. But as the game progresses, you learn more and more, and the plot twists and turns as you uncover more about what is really happening. As you descend farther into the Machine, you discover journal entries and voice recordings revealing the story, but only at the end does everything tie together. This form of storytelling has a way of pulling the player in, giving them clues to let them piece the story together, while making them want to keep playing so they can see if they were right all along. And the ending is nothing short of satisfying. Assuming you pay attention to the notes and conversations along the way, the game's conclusion leaves you without any big questions, and wraps everything up very nicely.\n\nAs I mentioned, this game is not by any means The Dark Descent, so playing it and expecting something just like it will not leave you with the same sense of satisfaction. A Machine for Pigs is a very good game, and if it weren't for a few small issues (namely some graphical problems and simplistic puzzles) I would even call it great. And for the $20 price tag, it's certainly worth it if you're a fan of any survival horror games. It won't make you soil your pants like Outlast and it won't make you go insane like The Dark Descent, but A Machine for Pigs certainly has its place in the genre.","September 20, 2013","true","6.4"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","1"

This is correct. I have heard complaints that this game is easier than its predecessor. This is also correct. I have heard complaints that this game is terribly bad. This is not correct.\n\nThrough effective use of sound and vision, The Chinese Room manages to create a horror game much more akin to the likes of Poe or Lovecraft, focusing on a slow burning dread rather than the all-out terror of the first Amnesia. This game is telling a story much more than the original Amnesia was. Sure, the original Amnesia did have a story and it was quite good, but the terror and the game mechanics were the centrepiece. This is not the case with A Machine for Pigs. Here, both terror and game take the backseat and the story and ambience is the main attraction. Personally I think this is a good idea, as this fits the talents of The Chinese room much better.\n\nThis is a good game. This is a great game. But do not expect a game as scary and gamey as Amnesia: The Dark Descent. If you crave something to make you scream in your youtube let's plays or to solve complex puzzles, this is not the game you want. If you want a well-told story in a well-realized enviroment, this might just be the thing you're looking for.","November 30, 2013","true","4.1"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","9","15","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sondusty/recommended/239200/","sondusty","Son Dusty","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sondusty/","119 products in account","Alright, let me start off by saying that the first Amnesia was among my favorite games ever. While the scares got a bit predictable towards the end, the puzzles remained at least moderately challenging and the story that unfolded was just simply incredible. With the year delay on the release of Amnesia 2, I was really excited for this game. A small flag came up for me when I saw that Frictional partnered up with the devs behind Dear Esther (I don't care what anyone says, that isn't a "game" but a pretentious bunch of boredom thrown together to seem artsy).\n\nI'm happy to report that The Chinese Room keeps up their air of pretentious stupidity throughout this game as well.\n\nLet's start with a positive; the atmosphere is great. From the very beginning I was cautious around corners and appreciating the game.  But Chinese Room never gets past this point. They create a wonderful atmosphere, but when they ask themselves "now what?" I imagine everyone in the company just kinda shrugs and says "add more bloom effects."\n\nThere are no puzzles. With the removal of the inventory system, you simply pick up a battery and put it in a machine to open a door. It never gets any more complex than that.\n\nThere are no real enemies (besides the very small 45 second segment at the end of the game). There are stupid little pigs that walk around, but they move slower than you do. In almost every situation you can just kinda walk or run past them and you'll be ok.\n\nAs I love to say, The Chinese Room is pretentious as hell. The whole overabused theme of "we're all pigs in the machine of society," which was never original to start with, gets beaten over and over until even the most stalwart fans of these devs (which is probably the devs' mothers) have to be second guessing their taste in entertainment. But the way the narator talks, even at the end of the story, you realize that the devs really, honestly, truly believe that this is the most original metaphor that has ever been created in the history of mankind. What's truly sad is that the story itself is actually somewhat decent, I'd say nearly on par with the first Amnesia, especially with the twist. However, the ending sequence that explains everything is done in such a purposely convoluted way that it's almost as if the devs are trying to flaunt some level of intellegence to anyone who will listen. That purposeful air of arrogance from the writers comes off as overly-conceited, making it seem like they view themselves as exceedingly superior to the player.\n\nNow, for the worst part; THE GAME IS ABOUT AN HOUR LONG. I played it through once, was convinced I missed something, played it through again, and realized that I had waited and extra year for them to scrap an entire game and give me crap.\n\nThere are good aspects here in what I would like to call a demo for a much better game:\n1. The atmosphere is incredible until you realize nothing ever actually happens, which makes the buildup turn stagnant very quickly. There's no sense of danger to accompany the dark and forboding mood.\n2. There's a "final boss" if you wish to call it that, which actually has the elements of a real game. Incredible, I know, it took every ounce of actual willpower that TCR has as a dev to make a real bit of gameplay. But it's essentially over in a minute and you never get anything else even remotely like it.\n3. There's one little scene at the end where you walk around the streets of London. Again, this could have been incredible, with an open map in a phenominally made environment in a scary game where enemies could be anywhere. But wait, it's just more narrow corridors, the roads all blocked by boxes, and all of the action happening offscreen while you just walk around.\n\nThat's all this "game" is. Action is implied to be happening elsewhere, but you're lucky to even witness it. You just walk from one room to the next picking up batteries and putting them where they go to open doors for an hour, then you get the same motifs and themes beaten into you for a good couple minutes before it ends and you're sitting there thinking "did I really pay 20 dollars for an hour worth of boredom." Yes, I did. And I'm writing this review so you won't. If you're really interested in it, find a YouTuber who does Let's Plays without all the stupid 10 year old screaming and scare cams and other crap (I can't point you in the direction of one, pretty much everyone on YouTube over-acts like this, so I avoid the site entirely) and watch them play the game through.\n\nHopefully Frictional goes in another direction with Soma, otherwise I think I'm going to write this company off as a failure. I like Penumbra, and Dark Descent was a classic addition to the survival-horror genre. It's a shame they had to ruin what was shaping up to be a fantastic series of games.\n","September 21, 2015","false","3.9"," 12 of 21 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","12","21","0","0"

Frictional Games shot their own feet with deleting the Custom Story feature, along with putting the game back instead of expanding it from Dark Descent. This doesn't feel like sequel - it feels like somehow ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ version of original Amnesia. Even if you somehow enjoyed the gameplay, it is ultra short - took me 3 hours to finish it, while the first one took like half a year (cause I was so scared to even launch it).

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DominoEventide/recommended/239200/","DominoEventide","Domino","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DominoEventide/","156 products in account","This game is largely unimpressive and an absolute disappointment compared to its predecessor.\n\nAdmittedly, the removal of the HUD, that is, the inventory menu, and all indications of just about anything, including loss of health and sanity (the latter of which was removed entirely), had a positive effect on immersion compared to Amnesia: The Dark Descent. However, this was quite possibly the ONLY potentially positive difference made between the games, and I use the word 'potentially' very hesitantly. Why? Because, and you can ask ANYONE who has played both games all the way through at least once, a lack of information and indication on your status in the game also causes a bigger lack of things to worry and stress about. And let's face it, what good is immersion if the gameplay itself is tedious and incites no feelings or emotions in the player other than absolute boredom, especially if you made the transition from the first to the second Amnesia video game? In the first Amnesia game, you were always constantly made aware of your health, sanity, objective, and situations/surroundings. The more you let your loss of health, sanity, and light sources get to you, the more you focused on your objective in the forms of memo and journal notes, and the more time you spent being chased by monsters or traversing through eerie environments, the more you'd have genuine feelings of fear, stress, and even despair the more you 'got into' the game.\n\nAmnesia: A Machine For Pigs has a huge problem with all of the above. Health is no longer indicated in any clear or visible form, which honestly has more of a penalty on immersion to begin with. Let's face it, if you're physically hurt, you're aware of it, because of the feelings of pain. In this game, all you can do is 'make your best guess' on your current physical well being based on your memory of how often you were hurt before and how long it had been since then. Sanity has been removed completely, further decreasing the levels of difficulty and immersion while playing, making the game itself even easier than it already is. All that's left is lore and exploration, and a video game composed of nothing but lore is NOT a video game, it's a walking simulator. Objectives are generally more confusing at first glance compared to the first game, but at the same time, they're very easy and tedious due to the fact that they are all marginally you having to walk around to specific points and interact with specific things. That's it. Goals and objectives in this game are basically normal everyday tasks in a slightly creepy environment. Speaking of environment, the next topic, the overall 'feel' of the game simply doesn't seem to fit within fear or horror anymore, and is closer to that of a creepy, almost surrealistic cliché. I mean, come on; someone wakes up in a dark room, and they have to go to laboratory full of failed and murderous genetic experiments?\n\nOh, the enemies, that's one of the biggest issues with the game. There is literally only one type of enemy which actively endangers you through the game, and only one other actual monster which is only found in the sewers, which is also there purely for cintematic effect; it's impossible to even see it up close and make contact with it. Compare this to the two enemies constantly hounding you in the first game, as well as two more found at specific points (the Kaernk or 'water monster' and the Shadow, or the bloody, goopy substance which constantly makes itself known in the form of restricting paths, adding scenery, and even actively hunting you down). More unique enemies essentially means more threat to the player. It adds a hopeless feeling of being outnumbered as well as constant paranoia that you can be watched and/or chased down more often and possibly even by more than one entity at once. Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs' enemy itself isn't even anything too exraordinary, especially when compared to the first game. The way it looks and sounds, and even its background isn't frightening, it isn't scary, it isn't even eerie or creepy. In fact, it's nothing short of silly, amusing, and cliché. It essentially look like a pig on a more-than-lethal dosage of steroids.\n\nEven the lantern isn't left untouched by the transition between both Amnesia games. Yes, there is a lantern once again, but, and I personally find this to be the worst out of all other changes and features in the game, the lantern has unlimited oil and it constantly flickers on and off whenever you are close to or looking at enemies and while witnessing 'disturbing or unsettling events. In addition to the factors of this being unrealistic (which further breaks immersion) and making EVERY scary event in the game incredibly predictable and generic, it has an effect on the player which makes it easier to proceed without caution while simultaneously making it unnecessary to explore thoroughly (since you don't need to find new, unique areas to find more lantern fuel).\n\n\nAmnesia: A Machine for Pigs as a whole game feels like it was rushed and lazily made.\nUnlike in the first game, there is not, nor will there ever be any possibility of custom stories. The developers themselves have made claims that it would be 'too difficult' to add custom story support due to the new engine, and that they will instead add new content to Amnesia: The Dark Descent instead, including but not limited to: new textures, monsters, and maps. Over a year later, we haven't even heard a single word about it yet. Even assuming this would ever be true, it almost makes it pointless to even buy the sequel in the first place. The first Amnesia game would be the obvious choice out of the two for any gamer to make since A Machine for Pigs is doomed to be a single adventure with absolutely nothing different or new put into the game while The Dark Descent supposedly gets even more playability and support than it already has.\nAnother problem lies within the fact that the playtime of one single story playthrough, whether you're playing for enjoyement and story or simply rushing through it, is significantly less in A Machine for Pigs' story than in the first Amnesia game. Having not even 5 hours into the game myself and getting close to the ending (I couldn't finish it even once because I got so BORED with it, I'm sorry), while my first playthrough in the first Amnesia took me nearly 20 hours, I can confidently say that this game isn't even worth buying. I actually enjoyed the main story in The Dark Descent so much that I played it all the way through four times, simply because it was absolutely massive by comparison and plenty of 'optional' exploration possibilities. Combine this with the fact that there's a bonus of an additional mode called 'Justine' and a collection of short stories for even more curiosity-invoking lore in the 'Remember' option of the game's startup menu, as well as TONS of custom stories all for free, and it's easy to see that this Amnesia game is nothing short of an embarassment to the first.","December 2, 2014","false","4.3"," 14 of 25 people (56%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","56","14","25","2","0"

It's not a  bad  game, but it's not great either. It had the tools to be better, but I felt like it wasn't utilized right. Ignoring the 'Amnesia' in the title, I mean as a Psychological-Horror game it left me on the fence. I ain't no critic, but I always been a fan of horror, suspense and this just left me apathetic.\n\nIn short: Don't expect much if you're going to play it. I can recommend it for the atmosphere and theme, but if your looking for story it's aight\n\nLong Version: Like I said before, this has the tools. And it's frustrating every time I think about it how much of BETTER game this should've been. They had the scenery, atmosphere, and MUSIC downpack but there's other stuff that could've been executed better.\n\nWhat I mean is the writing. At point the buildup just stopped , and I felt I got left out on the mystery and suspense. Me thinking "What the ♥♥♥♥ is going on, Who,  When, Where, etc." for too long put me out of the  immersion  that I didn't understand or didn't care anymore.\n\nBy the penulimate, I FELT that ♥♥♥♥ was getting real.

And I mean over the four or so hours it took me to clock this game, I can count the number of times I actually had any sense of fear on one hand. It had almost no puzzles, and while the story was alright, it really didn't grip me. If you want to play a game just for story, you might as well play Dear Esther. But then again, if you want a good story. WHY NOT READ A BOOK OR WATCH A MOVIE!\n\nSomewhere between the first and second hour I discovered that boredom had set in. And I was doing a speed run of the game. Which is never really any good for a horror game. People should be scared about what is around the corner, NOT RUNNING HEAD FIRST ROUND THE BEND IN A FUTILE ATTEMPT TO CURE THEIR SENSE OF BOREDOM.\n\nUltimately, People play Amnesia:AMFP to get scared. And yeah, some people would be scared by this game. Without a doubt. But it's not as scary as the original. For a start, the AI is laughably easy to avoid and ignore when compared to Amnesia, which is just pure awesome in a horror game. I mean, people are naturally scared of things that are difficult. "oh no, I'm so scared of this exam coming up", "Careful of those creatures, they'll smash you up". So if people are naturally scared of things that are difficult, or dangerous or powerful, then this begs the question: WHY THE HELL IS THE AI SO PASSIVE AND WEAK? What were they thinking? Without the threat of the AI I don't think there is anything else scary about this game. I mean the only other thing that could kill you is fall damage.\n\n\nNo puzzles and no credible threats makes Jack a dull boy.","September 13, 2013","true","3.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

So, you right now, reading this, might be wondering "Should I get this game?" Well, here is the answer. (In details)\n\nThe beauty of this game is not in the scares, nor the chase scenes, nor graphics but also with the story itself. It does have its moments, and it does have its creepy scenes, just not as good as Amnesia: The Dark Descent. The true beauty of this game is in its story. The story of this game in my opinion is just really nice. There is a lot of hidden symbolism that I think everyone should appreciate (I do) What makes this game unique is the fact that this story can be/is related to our modern lives in a way or another. It also relates to our parents and grandparents. What I liked about this story is that we can all relate to it somehow which makes it a little better. The story in Amnesia: The Dark Descent is amazing as well but I have not seen such similar hidden symbolism. Those messages throughout that adorn the story make it stand out. Sure it may be a little complex to comprehend and maybe the story may not be explained as much due to some reason which I will explain a little further but it is a really good game if you look at it in a different perspective. Okay, so this game somehow relates to political movements and actual tragic events that happened where some people might be offended if elaborated in the game. Those who understood it appreciated it and those who did not understand the hidden messages and symbolism found that it made no sense and that the story sucks as well. I really liked this game due to its story.\n\nIf you are looking for:\n-A game that will make you feel scared ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.\n-A game that has terrifying chase scenes.\n-A game that has extra ordinary graphics.\n-A game with complex puzzles that will need you to think heavily.\n-A super long campaign that will take more than 10 hours of gameplay.\nThen this is not the game for you.\n\nIf you are looking for:\n-A game that has some terrifying scenes but not the scariest out there.\n-A game that has a beautiful story with hidden messages throughout long notes found during the gameplay.\n-A horror game that concentrates on storyline more than to try to spook you.\n-A game that has an average length of gameplay (neither short nor long).\n-A game that has descent graphics yet not the best out there.\nThen this might be the game for you.\n\nHonestly, I don't like pointless games that just want you to feel scared for the sake of it. Also, for the people who say they could have added more scare scenes and some enemies that cannot be avoided easily then I will have to say it may have worked but then it would seem to be a little unnecessary. I mean, like in some games out there where they just overload with jumpscares and that after a while gets frustrating. (In Amnesia: The Dark Descent the amount of scares and chase scenes is just perfect) but in other games like Outlast or the DLC of it to be exact feel a little repetitive and just too sloppy. You would only like the game if you want to feel scared. Also Alien: Isolation is an example that the scares just feel that they are too much and you keep dying constantly. Luckily, I like both haha, games that make me feel scared and games with good stories! Anyway, if you are planning to buy this game but not too sure buy it now when there is still a sale!

The second Amnesia is also very scary, but not really a game. You should see this more like an experience instead of a game, a very disturbing experience.\nIt still has lots of elements that you can recognize from the first game, like footsteps around the corridor, small puzzles, a few jumpscares and horrifying monster encounters. What's different compared to the first game is that you don't have to search for fuel for your lantern and the fact that the whole sanity system is removed. Because of these adjustments, I didn't feel like I was in constant danger of running out of fuel or the inability to move forward because of the drained sanity. But I still had the feeling of encountering monsters anytime during the whole game. That's because the sound design and the music was so well made and as a result, me sitting on the tip of my chair throughout the entire game.\n\nAfter a few hours of playing you realise, half relieved / half disapointed, that the game is trying to scare you with scripted scares. At that point, Amnesia lost it's grip on my heart - a bit.\n\nSometimes you have to hide and flee from monsters, these are the only actual 'game-moments'. But this game isn't as scary and tense as the first game. However this game does surpass the first game with a deeper, more disturbing and twisted plot, including some very nice themes about industrialization, massacre, war and religion.\n\nThe combination of the beautifull enviroments, music, and the disturbing story, was enough to keep me playing for 6 / 7 hours. The fact that I didn't had as much heartattacks as when I played the first game, isn't always a bad thing.\n\n7,8/10","September 28, 2013","true","18.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

While it bears the same name in terms of storytelling there's not much similarity to Dark Descent other than the protagonist suffering from amnesia.\n\nThe creators went on trying to give us more freedom - this time there's no need to collect tinkers or oil; the player can now use a lamp indefinitely and can just focus on the puzzle solving. But this is what I lacked in this new Amnesia game - puzzle solving was better and more interesting in the first one.\n\nAdditionally, now you do not need to turn away from enemies when those are approaching  (and you are hiding in the dark) - there's no head pounding, hallucination etc.  but you do not get used to the dark this time - when it is dark it really is dark and you barely see anything until you raise the lamp.\n\nOne thing I did not like is the enemy type that was... well... I cannot say anything as it would be a spoiler.\n\nMachine for Pigs is a different experience. The core elements are there, yet, it feels different. But it is an Amnesia game, nonetheless. Thus, it is still highly recommended to play it at night with a headset. But is it recommended to the fans of the first game? Hard to say... I understand those who became disappointed.

Frictional shot themselves in the foot when they licensed Amnesia to Chineese Room.\nChineese Room developed  the marvelous masterpiece 'Dear Esther'. It was one of the worst games I have ever played. Seriously, go look up gameplay of it, it's pretty hilariously bad.\n\nSo why's it bad? Because it's NOTHING like Amnesia: The Dark Descent. The atmosphere feels forced and dull, the puzzles aren't nice breaks from the non-existent horror but rather there just to make you play the game for just a bit longer. As a matter of fact, apart from the bad puzzles, there's really not any challenge in the game. The 'monster' in AAMFP is basically a slow swine, that groans and moans at you. It's not surprising, it's not scary, it's just another bump in the road on your way to the next puzzle.\n\nThe story is not too bad, but it's delivered horribly. You start the game off waking up in your mansion, and you're suddenly thrown into a house with predictable and laughable jumpscares, with few bits of story. The story could've been good, if it wasn't delivered horribly. You have to pass boring and annoying puzzles and monsters to progress the story, and it's just not worth it.\n\nAll in all, it's a cash-in on the title of Amnesia. It's the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ child of an amazing horror license, which fell into the wrong hands.\n\nMy final verdict is a 3/10, a game to ignore. If you're a hardcore fan of Frictional Games (like me) you might enjoy bits of it, but overall it's not worth the time, money or effort.","March 16, 2014","false","1.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The game is also set in the same dark and twisted universe as the previous one, though in an entirely new time setting and features a new cast. The game features a rich and breathtakingly horrifying story.\n\nWhere the first game took place in Prussia in 1839, the second installment to Amnesia is now set in London 1899 on New Year's Eve. The protagonist, Oswald Mandus, who is a wealthy industrialist and butcher, has returned from an expedition to Mexico and has contracted a fever. At the beginning of the game, Mandus finds himself awakened in his mansion from his fever, which has lasted for several months. Only guided by the voices of his two sons, Enoch and Edwin, Mandus ventures out to find them, all while they lead him deeper into the abysmal depths of London...\nThe story is the main drive behind the game. Exploring the dark underworld of London is a thrilling experience. However, going through the game a 2nd time is less exciting, as all of the mystery will be gone. The replayability of the game is therefore nothing to brag about.\n\nControl & Gamplay:\nAmnesia is a first person game, where the main goal is to explore and delve deeper into a frightening world, and survive. You are armed with nothing but a lantern, thus rendering you utterly helpless should you be confronted with the horrors that await you. Therefore, running and hiding are your only options. This is one of the defining elements of the game. Being unable to defend yourself, you feel constantly threatened, danger lurks behind every corner and you are always on your toes, ready to run away and hide and beg god the thing chasing you doesn't find you.\n\nThe game itself is not difficult. The real challenge is in actually daring to advance further in the game before you get another heart attack. There are no real puzzles as in the previous Amnesia game, which is a shame. The "puzzles" that are present are very obvious and annoying. For the most part, the controls are good. However, when you have to use the few items in the game, the controls can feel clunky and difficult to coordinate.\n\nGraphics:\nThe visual aspect of the game is not impressive. However, the slightly dated graphics create a more gloomy and sinister atmosphere that fits very well with the overall mood of the game.\n\nSound:\nThe soundtrack is my favourite aspect of the game. It is deep and melancholic and it fits the dark and twisted mood of the game.\n\nConclusion:\nThe game offers hours of horror, mystery and heart attacks. Amnesia is a horrifying and exciting universe that must be experienced, especially under the cover of night and preferably all alone. However, in light of its predecessor, The Dark Descent, this game offers little new in terms of mechanics and features. The puzzles feel little more than inconvenient stops in the progression and they have been unnecessarily simplified. On the other hand, the story plays a more significant role, as it often comes across as eluding and perplexing. Thus, even after the credits have rolled, Amnesia will keep you pondering about what exactly has occurred throughout the course of the game.\n\nFor both old and new players to the Amnesia universe there is a twisted, yet compelling, story in wait, which is definitely worth the money.\n\nScore: 8/10","April 20, 2014","true","8.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

And in many ways stories do sell, just look at the Telltale Games' "Walking Dead" game. However people were expecting a game that "one ups" the previous game, Amnesia: The Dark Descent. It doesn't as far as scare factor goes, however it makes up in story. With that being said, be sure to buy this on a steam sale. It's worth atleast $10, maybe $15.\n\nGameplay is lacking, it’s definantly a step back from the previous game in that department. And the previous one wasn't particularly scary either. At least they tried however! There are some moments in this game where the level was seemingly designed for patrolling monster areas. It’s confusing!  Also the puzzles, which were also not hard in the first one, were laughable in the second. Really they were not puzzles, just impediments for your "walking sim" (see tags). With a grain of salt however it isn't particularly bad, the setting gives a lot of flavor and variety. Making the walking trip a little bit more enjoyable.\n\nThe "H. P. Lovecraftian" story and setting are top-notch; it's very disturbing, tragic, and contemplative. If only stories could sell alone. Clearly you don't need a good one in the case of "Outlast," great gameplay with genuine moments that can make you jump. However the story is... well... let’s just hope that the prequel DLC will have a good one. Although in retrospect the comparison between the two games is like comparing a campy movie and a book in the horror genre section. Getting back to Amnesia. Some of exposition in the pages in game probably should have been addressed in dialogue. There are needlessly vague plot points which are very relevant on how this came about and link directly to the previous Amnesia title. There are a group of people out there who ignore this exposition (A few sentences are just too much for them unfortunately). The dialogue does needlessly beats around the bush at times as well.\n\nGraphics; are not all that impressive. Lot of little details, but some of the textures are not great, clothe seems to be a particular problem. But then again this category was never a selling point, it is enough that it creates a level of immersion that doesn't take you out of the moment. The running movements however for some of the models were a bit clunky. Primarily because of how they were shaped (it just doesn't look like they were meant to run).\n\nThe music is also good and very memorable in the parts they were used.  Although there was this moment when the music was too good and didn't fit with the clunky movements on screen (The "Mors Praematura" and London scene, this scene really shows the graphical limitations of running models). The voice acting was very good also, even though were some lines late in the game which were a bit rusty in execution. But I am just being nit-picky in that regard. It is enough that you can sympathize with Mandus in his tragic quest.\n\nOverall Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs leaves much to be desired in gameplay, but the gameplay isn't particular bad. The story was good enough for me to recommend this title. It’s that good. Not to overhype it or anything, but when this game hits a steam sale… buy it, the journey into the depths of despair and desperation is worth it.","March 24, 2014","true","11.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

In other words, what you get is Dear Esther's essence wrapped in Amnesia. Don't expect the game to have puzzles or rooms to explore, this thing goes on tracks (nearly) like a steam locomotive and is only supposed to follow the track. I was able to learn in 15-20 minutes what I can open/collect and what are closed/unusable objects. If there is an item to pick, one have to use it. If there is a door that opens, one must go through it. Locked doors and such carry no value, meaning one is not going to run along the rooms to solve how to enter another room like in Amnesia. The game has an excellent atmosphere making this horror story enjoyable. What ruined my gaming experience was expectations for this to be a little more Amnesia than what it was. I was able to enjoy the game as soon as I let go of old Amnesia concept. In Amnesia, one must use light sources to keep sanity, in Piggy one has lantern that has no limits. To put it simply, in Piggy one does not have inventory, one does not need health, oil, any items. Also the the night vision (eyes get used to darkness in Amnesia) is gone. One more thing about tracks and monsters: because this game is supposed to run on tracks, monsters also disappear and appear randomly. Making it sometimes less.. scary. When I started to play the game without using lantern I mainly saw shadows of the monsters or heard the screams. To sum it up, this game has it's strong points and is enjoyable, just don't expect it to be Amnesia/Penumbra.","March 8, 2014","true","5.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

This is a first person interactive novel/film experience. There are no guns or weapons or inventory system and, honestly, this "experience" doesn't need such features ("experience" seems a better description than "game").  The developers have thought outside the box and created a brilliant work of entertainment that doesn't need to conform to the norms.  You'll have a thoroughly enjoyable (and sometimes disturbing) adventure.\n\nThis really shouldn't be thought of as "Amnesia 2".  You should probably look elsewhere if you want an Amnesia sequel.  This is more like a "mod" of Amnesia to create a different type of product.\n\nThe graphics, sound and environment are immersive. Set your gamma low and turn your sound up and get ready to be swept away in the adventure.  It's not super scary but it's certainly enough to bring a smile and chuckle after a fright scene.\n\nThe gore and blood is relatively tame but (personally) I wouldn't recommend this one for children or people of a sensitive disposition (although "scariness" is a subjective thing).\n\nA very worthy successor to Dear Esther.  The Chinese Room have done it again.

Instead, we get a great story and unique monsters wrapped in one of the least frightening games I have ever played. Half the length of the original game, with about a quarter of the features, A Machine for Pigs is truly a step back for Amnesia. I did like the idea of the electric lantern though. It'd be cool to see more games in the series using different light sources in different times, like maybe a game where you have to use torches, essentially combining tinderboxes and the lantern into one system?

In this game, unlike the dark descent, you don't have to be sparesome with fuel for the lantern, nor do what you can to keep sane, there's no such thing really as picking items up and keeping them in your inventory, such as keys you'd find, pick up and with them unlock doors to progress, in this game, where you need to go is already open... not to mention, you can't really sidetrack because if you try, you'll find that all the doors you're not supposed to go through, will be locked.. I was expecting greatness from this game, being the sequel to the dark descent if I'm not entirely mistaken, but after playing through it, I must say it fell short... the game felt short, was not quite as scary, even if sometimes very eerie in a way, but that's more around me not being a huge fan of steaming-engine sounds basically :) To sum it up, this game feels like a reply to people who have played The Dark Descent, complaining about it being "too hard" or "too obscure".. it feels like the game is made as a very much easier version than it's prequel.. Things I felt whilst playing the game, which kept coming back for several reasons is mainly disappointment, honestly... the game could've been so much more if it only kept some of the core elements of the dark descent, such as an inventory, keys/other "ulocking" items, fuel for the light source, whichever kind you'd like, and a health+sanity tracker etc. Unlike the dark descent this game felt very linear, never really branched off where you could pick where to go, what to get first of the x number of items you needed to progress etc.. If you're looking for a good horror game, or have played the dark descent, and are thinking about getting this one aswell, I'd say you'd be better off getting/sticking to Amnesia: The Dark Descent and leave this one be, since it's more a dissapointment in comparison to TDD, than it is enjoyable in and off of itself.. Sadly that's how I'm going to have to lable this game.","May 16","false","9.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

However, just because I mentioned that, it doesn't mean the game will be considered as bad than first one. You can easily tell from the title of the first game that it's a game of action and adventure. The Dark Descent..... oooooohh! Imagine about it... it's like you're descending somewhere dark and spooky and there will definitely be something there that'll haunt your skin. For A Machine for Pigs, it's a little different. The crazy hide n' seek and the cats n' mice frenzy we love about The Dark Descent faded a little after your escape from the descent. You're done with that no-living place. It's history, end of story. Now, how 'bout let's start a new century? A brighter one perhaps, not too dark or too overwhelming or trying to kill ourselves in horror wandering in the dungeons.... Maybe in a hungry city or a big mansion with a factory? We can also find more about the past or connection between Daniel and Alexander of Brennenburg. Won't that be an interesting adventure?\n\nThe important thing about A Machine for Pigs is its story, its connection with the previous game, its history and new generation. Just because it doesn't have a lot of monster hit and run doesn't mean it's bad or boring imo. I think the gameplay, the story and the atmosphere is very very beautiful and well done. They fit well. I just love it, same with Dear Esther and Outlast. In any game, gamers should be advised to focus on both the story and the gameplay, not just one of them as it'll be biased.\n\nA Machine for Pigs does have action though, but not a lot as the previous one. There are some parts in this game where you have to be quick as possible, or those damn pigmen will catch your a$$. It can be scary and uncomfortable too in some sticky situations. In the first game, you are most likely exploring in a dungeon and in the dull ancient stoned castle of Brennenburg. Whereas for A Machine for Pigs, you're exploring different rooms, different houses and you're able to roam the city, which is pretty nice.\n\nMost of all, if you're a fan of indie horror games or Amnesia and Frictional Games, then why not try this game out?!? But, if you're a gamer who prefers action-based indie horror games or who doesn't have money, then there's no problem for you to deny getting this game. Your choice mate.\n\nI recommend this game to teenagers, indie horror lovers and people who loves stories.  Also for people who have money xD. I would rate this game 4/5 Stars.\n\nGame motto: Look at it. Think about it. Buy it. Play it. Judge it.","June 26, 2014","true","9.3"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

That was sort of my first mistake. Having huge expectations after the first game, I sadly had to be let down. This does not mean the game is bad, this just means, that after "The Dark Descent" it probably just had to go downhill. And even though I would love to judge the two games separately, comparing the two is sort inevitable.\n\nOn the up side, I believe the story in this game is way more interesting, heart touching, and creepy at the same time, than the intricate, but slightly… “whatever” story in the first game. It is more personal, and emotional, and the outcome is way more disturbing.\nThe music has definitely left an impression, and I still listen to "Mors Praematura" from time to time, cause the atmosphere it created was divine. Graphics are noticeably better, as the game is a fresher release.\n\nYet, as I moved through the empty house, as I watched Mandus' story unwind, I felt complete peace. And this is not what you want to feel, when playing a horror game. Maybe I have developed a strong resistance to scares, cause of my love for horror, but as hard as the game tried - I just could not get scared.\n\nEven though I love the design of the monsters in this game (whom I will refrain from calling by their name, in case you would rather be surprised), I found it hard to fear them. Found them extremely disturbing, but also had a strong sense of pity for them. They just couldn't get me in the "oh crap, oh crap, oh crap, running away" mode, that the first game had me in most of the time.\n\nAlso the puzzle difficulty in this game is very low, and doesn't require any real thinking skills. Which can be considered an advantage by some, but for me is again, very disappointing.\n\nSo in conclusion, I would suggest playing this game for the interesting story, which left a strong unease in my heart, and the amazing music that stays with you for a long time. But if you are expecting getting really scared, or a good mind boggling puzzle, you will probably be left with a feeling of letdown. All in all, not a bad game, just probably not what you would expect.\n","December 27, 2014","true","3.1"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

I loved every single moment of it. Even the parts that weren't very scary.\n\nI played this game all the way through, and I have to say, I was horrified. Was I horrified by monsters constantly chasing me or something jumping out? No, I was not. What horrified me, you ask?\n\nThe plot.\n\nIf you are going in to this game expecting something like The Dark Descent, turn away right away. It is very different from the first. Is that bad? No.\n\nThe game is highly dedicated to telling it's story, which is absolutely horrifying in every detail. It is exactly what the description says it is. It is a game that drags you into the depths of greed, power, and madness.\n\nLooking back at The Dark Descent, it did not have a very good plot. Sure, it worked for the setting of the game and was well written, but for what it actually is, it is rather simple. It did not scare me at all, even with the horrible things it implied. However, the game made up for the uninteresting story with the absolute terror it induced into every one of it's players.\n\nNow lets look at A Machine for Pigs. It has it's scary moments, but it isn't very scary once played all the way through. However, the plot of this game got me hooked, and I wanted to know everything about it. By the end, I was absolutely shocked. The game features a storyline that if you really, truely listen to, will put you at the edge of your seat. It is told in a way that is very vague, and requires you to think.\n\nThe other features of this game are also very well done. The sound design if phenominal. It's so well done that you actually feel like you are descending into a horrible, dark machine. The music is some of the best I have ever heard in a game, and it goes very well with what is going on.\n\nThe game isn't trying to be like The Dark Descent. It wants to be different, and it wants to scare us in a different way.\n\nIf you want something exactly like The Dark Descent, do not buy this game. If you want to be scared in a new way while being told a beautiful story, then this is the game for you.","January 10, 2014","true","5.4"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","1"

This is a shame really, considering how atmospheric this game really is.\nThe Amnesia HPL game engine succeeds in giving a real sense of weight to the machinery, and together with the sound design it actually manages to fully drag you in at certain moments in the game.\n\nWhat the game lacks is partially some of the gameplay mechanics that made the original Amnesia what it is today. This current system is simplifield, which in a way breaks the sense of helplessness the original game introduced.\nThe game is also extremely linear, which might not necessarily be a bad thing, but compared to the original it feels way too limited and scripted. On the other hand, the way the story is told could have suffered from too much freedom as well.\n\nAll these areas of critique are, however, intensified by this being a successor to what could arguably be, the best and most well designed horror game of all time.\n\nIf you can look past its flaws, this is a short and sweet horror experience that is still one of the better examples of how the genre is presented today.

Without it, games such as Silent Hill, Resident Evil, and Dead Space wouldn’t have been so memorable or horrific and would have just been regular games with some creepy zombies and monsters. Fun yes, but not terrifying or enough to keep your blood pumping and your heart racing. But when it comes to atmosphere in Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs? This game has it.\n\nFrom the dark and gloomy lighting to the various background noises, or lack thereof at times, I was on the edge of my seat throughout the entire game. Always expecting something to jump out at me, I traversed through the various rooms of the mansion, factory, sewers, tunnels, and other locations – all of which looks great thanks to the graphics that add little touches such as lighting effects, fog, and debris.\n\nThe story was much better than A Machine for Pigs’ predecessor Amnesia: The Dark Descent, likely due to the collaboration between Frictional Games and Dear Esther developer The Chinese Room. I found it to be more intriguing as I wandered through the game and learned more about the character and the tragic events that transpired. I started to learn more about what had happened to the children and the factory, among other things, as I progressed through a mixture of reading journals, flashbacks, and narrated scenes (where the voice acting was great). These revelations continued to enhance the dark, gloomy, and horrifying atmosphere.\n\nTo read the rest of my review visit Press2Reset: http://press2reset.com/reviews/review-amnesia-a-machine-for-pigs/","November 26, 2013","true","14.2"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

The developers, which is The Chinese Room, they have had a much bigger focus on the atmosphere and the surrounding in the game that Frictional Games had, which to me was a good thing. It's not necessarily a very scary game, but it makes you feel like you want to quit the game and continue to play at the same time, because of the great atmosphere.\n\nThe only thing I found a little bit dissapointing was the length of the game, I thought it was going to much longer. And it was the same with the puzzles in the game, they were a bit too short and easy from time to time.\n\nTo finish of, I would like to say this game had an excellent story and a very dynamic atmosphere.

That game becomes famous. And then, when a sequel comes out, it’s made simpler, easier and more “accessible”. That’s what happened here.\n\nThe only good things about it are the extraordinary voice acting and the story. The actors knew this was a serious game and took it that way and the story is good enough to keep you from uninstalling before you finish it.\n\nYou no longer have to manage which torches or candles you light up. There’s no more insanity, so you can be in the dark and look at enemies all the time you want. Puzzles are mostly just picking something up and taking it from one place to the other.\n\nThis game is also hardly scary. It only scared me three times in four hours.\nIt doesn’t have many jump scares, but you don’t need them to make a game scary. Some of the things that made the prequel scary were moments like hiding in a room and then, when an enemy entered the room, hoping he wouldn’t look at where you were. Or having an enemy chasing you and you knew you couldn’t outrun it. You had to close doors or setup obstacles on your way. The sequel has none of this.\n\nMy main problem with it is the difficulty. I’ve been playing video games regularly since 1993 (even earlier, if you count electronic games) and this was the very first non-racing/sports/strategy game ever that I finished without dying. And I’m not even that good. Before this, my best survivability record was only dying twice when I finished “Sonic Chaos” for the first time with Tails, when I was a teenager. When I became aware of my “invincibility”, I stopped being afraid of the pigs.\n\n“Amnesia: The Dark Descent” will be known in History as one of the greatest horror games. “Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs” will be a footnote saying there was a sequel. Well, I hope Frictional Games made plenty of money with this use of the Amnesia name.","September 15, 2015","false","4.8"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","0"

The game takes place mostly in factory like setting.\n\n+ The narrative and plot is excellent, journal entries are scattered throughout the game providing pieces of the story. The story touches upon some interesting themes.\n\n+ Light puzzle solving elements to keep things interesting\n\n+The game doesn't overstay its welcome, it is roughly a 4-6 hour experience.\n\n+ The music is excellent and really adds to the overall experience\n\nThe Bad:\n\n- The game lacks a lot of the terror from the Dark Descent.  Despite the atmosphere, I never really felt threatened in any way. In the entire game there were only a few instances where the enemy would hunt you and even then it was very easy to just out run them to the next area. Part of the problem is that this game heavily streamlined many of the elements from the first game. Death has no consequence, sanity effects gone, refilling the lantern gone... . Many of the things that make the first game so terrifying no longer exist in this game.\n\n- Technically and artistically the game didn't impress me. A lot of the later levels have the 'been there done that' feeling to them. Everything "feels" the same.\n\nConclusion\n\nThis is a game of expectations. If you were expecting the gameplay of Dark Descent then you will be disappointed. What you are playing this game for is the atmosphere, exploration and narrative, just don't expect anything more.\n","October 6, 2014","true","4.1"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","8","14","0","0"

It's not good. But looking at the developer that was obvious. The chinese room is amazing at atmosphere and if this game was a cheap short jaunt into the machine it would have been amazing.\n\nThis however?\n\nGot dull. There was almost no thrill to be found, things got old, the enemies were incredibly repetative for how little they actually appeared (One was added at the VERY end, only to be used twice. There were a number of times I could see irritating clipping. The voices, while done well droned on.\n\nOverall, while I LOVED games like Gone Home and Dear Ester, this  game? It was just boring. I KNEW what my character did for the longest time in the game, yet it get droning on about it so I was just left there waiting for the penny to drop.\n\nThere was only...twice where I had anything close to a bit of fear. Once you realise that most areas literally have NO threats to you, you just rush through.\n\nThat's another thing. It's only 5 hours long? A part of what padded out the playtime of the original amnesia was the need to collect oil, tinder and the fun you had when you got bored of just throwing ♥♥♥♥ around. This game has NONE of that. You just move through the levels, no need to explore.\n\nThe most interesting part of this game to me was the very beginning. Exploring the house and discovering more about the characters. As it started to decend into the machine though it, again, got dull.\n\nOne thing that really bugged me is that I REALLY wanted to see the machine properly. To look at it in it's glory but the draw distance on those objects was far too short and I doubt there was much effort in designing something the player wouldn't see.\n\nanother thing was small graphical things. Clipping and noticing spots where textures didn't meet, creating a gap where there was no texture. Yes many games have those and I was willing to look past that but at the very end there were two spots, the convayer belt leading to stairs where your children are constantly appearing in the alcoves, watching you. The  belt clips into the stairs at the end. For such a cinematic part it really killed it for me.\n\nThen, at the end where you get into the chair. It really bugged me that he had no body, EVEN then. It was the very end of the game and you only had one thing left to do. Yet you were just a floating camera, no body, no anything. AND then when those arms come down they clip through a part of the console you just used.\n\nOverall it just didn't feel like fun or worth the time I put into it.","August 22, 2015","false","5.7"," 9 of 16 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","9","16","0","0"

In addition to a "lack" of horror, it's lost a lot of the key gameplay elements of TDD like lantern oil, an inventory, puzzles and exploration.

The plot isn't all that great and it isn't as immersive as the previous game, but it's interesting.\nI have no complaints about the game mechanics except for the lantern. The lantern has an infinite burn time, you don't need to go find oil for it. I think that limiting lantern use makes the game more creepy. It does attract the antagonist, but you can easily outrun him. The AI for them is a bit lacking compared to The Dark Decent.\nThe atmosphere will make you reluctant to continue with the game. I played 20 or 30 minutes at a time before I got completely creeped out and stopped to play less creepy games.\nI'll give it 6/10 simply because the plot was so lacking and the infinite lantern.","August 10, 2014","true","5.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Having played 'Dear Esther' (also from Chinese Room), I noticed the similarity that the game focuses largely on the narrative and their excellent ability to tell a story that can almost be classified as virtual literature. This causes the game to lose some ground in the interactive part. In itself I don't find this to be a negative point, since too much interactivity can interrupt the flow of a game if not done properly, but I expected the game to have the same balance between scary moment, storyline and interactivity as The Dark Descent. And I think that is the reason why the reviews might be a bit more negative than they might have been if it wasn't so closely related to the Dark Descent. If you can set aside your expectation for the game and play it with an open mind, you're in for a treat.\n\nThe game is short, for me it was about 5 hours. Thing is, if a game lacks interactivity or the story loses its pace, it might be a good thing to not have the game taking 10 hours. While the story might be good, you don't want to get the reputation that folks want to finish your horror game to see how it ends, but are bored throughout it instead of scared stiff every once in a while. So all in all 5 hours is a good time for a decent horror game.\n\nCatch the game on a sale if you want the money to match the amount of game time (I have this arbitrary rule that 1€ = 1h game time to make it worth my while, but that's just my idiosyncrasy).\n\nFinal verdict: Play it without expecting it to be like The Dark Descent and you will have about 5 hours of good creepy fun.","July 29, 2014","true","5.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It started off strong and I found myself a little scared in some parts. The music, the lighting and the music all worked well together to achieve this. However, as the game progressed, it became a little repetitive. Navigate this room, find a note, flip some switches, open doors and occasionally run away from the enemy. What kept me going to the end was the story. I wanted to know the ending.\n\nControls were fairly simple. Move forward, point and click your mouse, occasionally use your lantern and sprint. I had a lot of fun playing it until about 3/4 through where the game got buggy. My game kept crashing at one loading screen, which is apparently common for this game. A few changes to my graphics settings and I was able to continue. I didn't hit a problem until the 2nd last chapter where I encountered a bug that caused my map not to load properly and me to fall to my death. That would have been okay.....but then on respawn, that same bug made it impossible for me to move on to the next stage. A fact that didn't dawn on me until an hour later after dying to the electric Manpig a bunch of times while trying to open a door that was bugged shut. A reload to an earlier save point fixed this however. And almost 7 hours later.... game finished.\n\nSo, if you're looking for a cheap scare for a few hours and enjoy a decent story, I reccommend this game. I give it a solid 7 out of 10.

I'm not sure if it is just me, and it was simply too complicated for my feeble mind, or if this game really based on a fever dream one of the developers had one night, but in short, I was totally lost with the story, but damn if I didn't wet my britches while running away from sheer terror.\n\nAnyways, Machine for Pigs (No, I have not finished it) so far is a much simplier story, one of which a father is looking for his children, while exploring the giant slaughter house that he inhiereted from his father's rich pork business. Yes, there is not that many scares, and with the few there is are harmless.\n\nSo pretty much just flip-flop the two focuses of the two games. Dark Descent: Terror > Story;  Machine for Pigs: Terror < Story.

No, the monsters aren't as disturbing, the sanity and limited lamp oil mechanics are gone in this game (which means, you can look at the monsters directly). Is it as good as The Dark Descent? No, there is no inventory, little exploration and the puzzles are easier. Is it even scary? Well... it's really creepy, the ambient sounds are good, the monster noises are chilling, and when the hell breaks loose, you get the sense of urgency to get all fixed once for all.\n\nThen why do I recommend it? Mostly because of the plot. As in the original, you want to get this over once for all. And as you descend, you begin to discover the story of a man playing God. But no, it was something far worse. But most of all, it's a critic about society and human civilization.\n\nBottom line. This game it's definitely inferior to the first Amnesia, but it's not a bad game.

It started off strong and I found myself a little scared in some parts. The music, the lighting and the music all worked well together to achieve this. However, as the game progressed, it became a little repetitive. Navigate this room, find a note, flip some switches, open doors and occasionally run away from the enemy. What kept me going to the end was the story. I wanted to know the ending.\n\nControls were fairly simple. Move forward, point and click your mouse, occasionally use your lantern and sprint. I had a lot of fun playing it until about 3/4 through where the game got buggy. My game kept crashing at one loading screen, which is apparently common for this game. A few changes to my graphics settings and I was able to continue. I didn't hit a problem until the 2nd last chapter where I encountered a bug that caused my map not to load properly and me to fall to my death. That would have been okay.....but then on respawn, that same bug made it impossible for me to move on to the next stage. A fact that didn't dawn on me until an hour later after dying to the electric Manpig a bunch of times while trying to open a door that was bugged shut. A reload to an earlier save point fixed this however. And almost 7 hours later.... game finished.\n\nSo, if you're looking for a cheap scare for a few hours and enjoy a decent story, I reccommend this game. I give it a solid 7 out of 10. Points lost for the bugs encountered.","June 28, 2014","true","6.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/joe_bonanza/recommended/239200/","joe_bonanza","Happiest ever","http://steamcommunity.com/id/joe_bonanza/","208 products in account","I will be making this relatively short review a positive one for one reason alone.\nThat is that it's not a review of an Amnesia sequel.\n\nMuch more so than its predecessor, the game feels and acts like an interactive movie, being 110% linear with less exploration than a retired Indiana Jones trying to find his way to bed. It is, like previous titles, heavily narrated at certain points, and most of the story and background story is told through this narration, or pieces of paper. While it does indeed have a very interesting story, any survival horror game should focus on a mix between both story, gameplay/immersion, and ambiance, one of which is lacking almost entirely to most players because:\n\nIf you go into this expecting an Amnesia experience, you're going to be extremely disappointed and left with horrible gameplay that is impossible to immerse yourself in the way you're used to. But if you remove the word "Amnesia" from the title, and focus on it as a standalone survival horror game, it tries and does a relatively good job compared to other titles of the genre when the game came out. Inventory, oil, insanity, all is removed from the game because believe it or not, it ruined immersion at the worst possible times, by making you fall over and gurgle at the mere sight of an enemy, tumble around the dark tediously clicking everything... Before falling over and gurgling at the darkness, or by just leaving you clueless and aimlessly wandering back and forth until you find that one thing you use once and never again to unlock the next area of exploration. This game removes all of these tedious, immersion-breaking aspects and leaves you with a fully immersive game that does not feel like a traditional game at all.\n\nA Machine For Pigs is an immersive experience above that of The Dark Descent... If you have not played The Dark Descent. And if so, I would recommend that you play this before playing The Dark Descent, as this game WILL disappoint you, should you play its predecessor first.\n\nRemove "Amnesia" and I give it a solid 8/10 as an independent horror game. Should I have reviewed it as a sequel, I'd have given it a 2-3/10.","December 22, 2014","true","10.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This might be true for some veterans of horror games. My interpretation of the game is that it might not gravitate its whole theme about fear, but rather a story of how the nature of humanity changes in an age of industrialization.\n\nThis game does take some dramatic turns you might not expect.

In addition to a "lack" of horror, it's lost a lot of the key gameplay elements of TDD like lantern oil, an inventory, puzzles and exploration.

Of course like any horror game, I think it helps when you play this when its dark outside with the lights out and a pair of good headphones with fully trying to immerse yourself into the story.  I would say its not near as scary as TDD but it had its few moments, at least for me it did. You no longer have an inventory, nor does your lantern need to be refilled, neither do you go insane in this one, elements I did kind of miss at the beginning, but got used to it pretty quickly.

The ending is a bit "neh" due to that. I would not call it a sad, scary or intense game at all. It's alright by means that it has a plot.\n\nThe engine is the same as the previous game with some new objects added.\n\nThe scariest thing for me was properly the trophy room, which you probably will understand why if you see it.\n\nThe game is not worth the 12 euro I gave for it for the story and graphics, but I'm sure it's worth the effort the developer put into it, considering the game is almost a year late!\n\nIf you like scary games, then this is probably not the game for you. It concentrates on instant shocks rather than atmosphere. It lacks the ambience in most parts of the game, but you are able to hear the soundtracks in the rather important parts.\n\nLots of puzzles, but they are easy enough to figure out.\n\nThe game is VERY metaphorically! Basically everything is considered a metaphor for something else, so beware of that!\n\nMy recommendation for the game:\n6/10\nThe story is not horrible, but it misses out on some points, and is very predictable. It's not a Frictional Game production and you can clearly feel the difference, however if you want to check it an almost scary game, then this is probably the right for you.\nAmbience could be better by creating an atmosphere instead of just listening to the sounds of the machine.","September 13, 2013","true","5.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Machine for pigs is less scary, more linear, and if anything a bit uglier perhaps. Yet I still recommend it if for nothing else that it still maintains the Amnesia atmosphere, and I actually like the story better than that of Dark Descent.\n\nLong Stroy Short:\nCons:\n-Runs like crap, game doesn't look very good, and I had to set it back to low to even eek out 20 fps (and I meet the recommended reqs)\n-Very, very linear. If you enjoyed the open-ended "search for the thingy to open the door" gameplay of Dark Descent, then Pigs will sorely disappoint you. It's basically move through the area to the end, avoid a monster sometimes.\n-Pretty short, finished the whole game in 3.8 hours, but Dark Descent was about that long too.\n\nPros:\n-Great atmosphere, and an interesting setting to boot, much better than some haunted castle as with Dark Descent.\n-Really enjoyed the story, Dark Descent got kinda convuluted and weird towards the end, and I really liked Pigs story. No complaints there.\n\nTLDR; Buy on sale unless you really really want more Amnesia, otherwise, wait till on sale. Enjoyable experience overall.

As of now i haven't finished the game because of a game crash,\n\nYou should be able to save at will instead of saving and quiting or rely on the auto saves as i have to play for about 30 min before reaching the point i was at prior to the crash. This ruins it for me as the game is linear and you rally don't have a reason to play through it twice.\n\nI have played through amnesia: the dark decent three time and it still gives me chills. This game however would be lucky if it could scare me on the second playthorugh.\n\nThe monsters in this game lack some level of scaryness and i don't really fear rushing on as there are no scary audio that backs up the fact that they are chasing me, and when they see you, it is not very hard to run away. If you tried that in amnesia :TDD you would be killed before getting anywhere and the scary music would make me take a 2 day break in an instant\n\nThe game also removed the inventory and it also have no sanity bar(or health meter) also you no longer need to rely on tinderboxed and oil to progress, there are no wardrobes to hide in either. Taking all of this things away is like taking away key parts of the original\n\nWhile you still can't fight the game doesn't make it challenging at all. It is a cakewalk at least until the part i am at. And there are only a couple of jumpscares, other than that it is the usual thrill when you get to see the monster for the first time.\n\nCompared to Amnesia: the dark decent i don't think this game does it justice, but the game is fairly scary and i would recommend it to fans of Amnesia","September 10, 2013","true","5.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Although, not as frightening as its predecessor, when the story sinks in, you realize how twisted and crazy this game is that you're playing. Besides, it's so well written and this is what these people love to do!\n\nSome of the elements I feel stole away from the suspense were due to a "lack of" rather than an "addition to." No longer having a solid inventory (minus some notes and a journal), no need for a lantern that runs out of oil leaving you in the dark, no real looting, no health deficiency, no sanity meter, and so on, all once contributed to the strength of the user's play. But that was all missing from this game. And this wasn't really apparent until half way through it. Though, eventually, I had forgotten about it and was so focused on the plot.

Not because of your squishy, oink-y looking enemies, but because of the literal framework of the building - overlapping, rusted grating. Doors that look like they might explode outward at any second. Machinery that towers menacingly over you, giving you the idea that the machine really is bigger and more powerful that you. Dark tunnels, leading to no where.\nThe music was very well done along with the level make-up, well timed and very appropriate for the situations they were cued in to.\n\nWhat I noticed to be the biggest difference between Amnesia 1 and 2 is that in 2, there was really a lack of scary moments compared to 1. Since The Chineseroom produced this game, one should expect that story will almost immidiatly become more important that jump scares and chase scenes. They do happen, chase scenes, but the ultimate creep factor of this game comes from the accumulation of the notes, journal entries and audio logs and what they ulitmately mean. I won't spoil the end for you, but just know that the lack of (in the words of the Escapist) "aboogly woogly woo" will be made up for in the finale.\n\nIm going to keep this brief so as not to ruin the game for you cause you need to get it.

So, there are no limited resources to grab, no sanity to keep or torches that run out of oil.\n\nThis time, the game would prefer to let its intense story scare you than the prospect of running out of torch light. You will either love or hate this change. Fans of survival horror may be dissapointed if that is what they are expecting. Fans of the original game who want something new and different will certainly enjoy it.\n\nI think most will agree after playing both games that the Dark Descent was more immediately terrifying.

Not because of your squishy, oink-y looking enemies, but because of the literal framework of the building - overlapping, rusted grating. Doors that look like they might explode outward at any second. Machinery that towers menacingly over you, giving you the idea that the machine really is bigger and more powerful that you. Dark tunnels, leading to no where.\nThe music was very well done along with the level make-up, well timed and very appropriate for the situations they were cued in to.\n\nWhat I noticed to be the biggest difference between Amnesia 1 and 2 is that in 2, there was really a lack of scary moments compared to 1. Since The Chineseroom produced this game, one should expect that story will almost immidiatly become more important that jump scares and chase scenes. They do happen, chase scenes, but the ultimate creep factor of this game comes from the accumulation of the notes, journal entries and audio logs and what they ulitmately mean. I won't spoil the end for you, but just know that the lack of (in the words of the Escapist) "aboogly woogly woo" will be made up for in the finale.\n\nIm going to keep this brief so as not to ruin the game for you cause you need to get it.

I honestly feel bad that Frictional games allowed this title to be released under the Amnesia banner because this just does not live up to the original Amnesia. The sense of horror and complete helplessness that the original had is close to nonexistent in A Machine for Pigs. It is also significantly shorter.\n\nThere is basically zero gameplay elements because the inventory has been removed and the enemies in the game which you are supposed to be weary of are few and far between. The Dark Descent also had two central "hub" areas which you could explore around, as to not make the game linear. A Machine for Pigs is COMPLETELY linear and there are basically zero puzzles. The "puzzles" are literally just flip a few switches and move on. That's it. Super dissappointing. Also, as another reviewer mentioned, the game warns you ahead of time when anything out of the ordinary is going to happen by making the lights flicker and your lamp flickers. What is the point of making a horror game when you cue the player into knowing EXACTLY when and where the scary moments are? The design just doesn't make sense.\n\nAs far as the story goes, it is overly symbolic and never really draws you in. I feel like the story relies on making you care about the events which are occurring, yet it never does anything to make you care about the events. The best analogy I can make is the story feels like a nightly news broadcast about some random story that you don't care about.\n\nVerdict: Skip this waste of time and play the original Amnesia.\n\nA Machine for Pigs takes about 5 hours to complete.\n\n4/10\n\nPlease upvote this review if you found it useful :)","January 1, 2014","false","4.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Also, some of the environments and machinery looks very good. But really, I just finished it and I'd be really hard pressed to come up with anything else. And both those come with a hitch or two. The story isn't engaging until it's been built and fails to deliver on the whole "Amnesia" aspect. And the game is horribly optimized so you can't really enjoy anything when it comes to the graphics or gameplay. Perhaps I was the unlucky one with the perfectly wrong setup but I could not get this game to avoid frame rate drop offs (big ones) on any graphic settings at all. At least 30mins of my gameplay time is adjusting settings. No matter how low and small or how high and big I went the frame rate got beat in to the ground at random spots. And thus detracted from the already shallow gameplay and the pleasant environment visuals. But while this was the most glaring and annoying issue, I can't say my review would change much if the frame rate was a steady 60FPS.\n\nNothing drew me in. You walk. You run. You climb a ladder here and there. You pull a lever. The gameplay is as shallow as it gets. You never have to think or complete a puzzle. You can only interact with what you need and usually its just a couple feet away from where it goes. There's absolutely no mystery as to where you're going or what you should do. Just no confusion at all, no "Amnesia" if you will. While the environments look great there's a lack of atmosphere built. Maybe the sound is just average? Maybe the special effects are lacking? I do not know, but it just lacked the atmosphere the first game created as a whole. An hour in I was already looking forward to the end as it began to feel like a tedious chore even though it wasn't really tedious. If that makes sense haha... I just couldn't get drawn in. There was no intensity or panic. I never felt threatened. Even when enemies have a rare appearance in the game a little jog in a circle around an object will buy you the time you need. Just no threats in the game at all.\n\nAs a standalone game it doesn't offer much at all and as a sequel it is downright awful. I applaud the effort and was able to enjoy some late game moments as things built up in a grand way and the story was more valuable than gameplay. But as someone who just enjoyed Amnesia: The Dark Descent I couldn't be more disappointed in Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs.\n\nThrow an absolutely atrocious price tag on top all of this and I can comfortably tell you to avoid this game.","December 18, 2014","false","4.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The story isn't much but hopefully the scares and immersion will make for it (Spoiler, They don't.)\n\nScares and Immersion:\nScares are incredibly weak since most of it is sound effects and nothing else (but I will admit the game did scare a bit only because of the sound effects). The enemies themselves aren't even scary because the game does a nice job of making you see them a lot before they become an actual threat also the lights around the place warn when an enemy is nearby. Immersion is a bad one also since the game focuses sound only on loud noises and the environment doesn't draw in at all.\n\nPuzzles:\nPuzzles are almost nonexistent. The "puzzles" are merely carrying one object to another room, placing said object into where ever it goes, and hitting a switch when you're done. The lack of an inventory destroys all possible puzzles there could have been and instead makes them all too simple.\n\nExploration:\nSince the game doesn't have an inventory, there is no real reason to explore besides to look at the area even then the areas are so linear that there is still no reason to explore. The game doesn't reward exploration and the only thing to gain is journals entries except you still don't need to explore since most of them are in plain sight.\n\nMechanics that were in Amnesia: The Dark Descent but removed:\n-Sanity Meter: While the sanity meter was sort of annoying in the first game, it encouraged you to stay out of the dark and to not look at the monsters but with this removed, you can stay in the dark as much as you want and stare at the monsters all you want once again making them less scary.\n-Inventory: This had no reason to being removed since it helped the game out with puzzles and encouraged the player to explore and collect objects.\n-A limited lantern: The lantern got changed in such a way that took away most of the horror in the game and that being it has unlimited light. Dark Descent's limited lantern encouraged the player to only use it when it was really needed while in this game the lantern can be out at all times and the worry of it running out isn't there also the lantern is key in knowing when a monster is nearby since it flickers when one is close once again taking away the fear of the enemy.\n-Large amount of physics: This game will hardly let you pick anything up or move anything\n-Custom Story Support: This one thing is the main reason I still play Dark Descent since I know that when I'm done with one story, I can go download another. Some custom stories are incredibly well done and playing those provides whole new experience with the same game.\n\nThe Monster:\nThe monster is nothing to be scared of in appearance or sound (unless you think an angry pig snort is scary.) The enemies look like humans with pig features such as snouts and hooves for feet. The monster ‘s AI isn't the best either, at times they can stand right in front of you and not notice anything. There was also this time where I flashed the lantern in its face and stood directly in front of it and it didn't notice me and instead went the other direction. Also the monsters despawn incredibly fast.\n\nOutside sections:\nThe game lets you go outside and its' a great new feature but the Amnesia engine is great with inside buildings only so the outside parts don't look amazing and even when you're outside, you still get this feeling of being boxed in.\n\nThe Wrap-up/ The TL;DR:\nThis game is complete let down when comparing to Dark Descent but when not comparing, it still doesn't do that well. To be honest, this game felt more like a mod for the first game than an actual stand-alone game. This game really shouldn't even have Amnesia as the title since it is nothing like it should or could be. I suggest not buying this and instead getting the first game or wait till Frictional's next game.\n\n(I know that it isn't Frictional's fault that the game ended up like this and I know the Chinese Room is to blame.)","June 23, 2014","false","4.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"

Not the trivial horror in which the player is always firing with a shotgun, but a deep and perverse psychological experience that dig into the player's darkest thoughts. This second chapter differs in many ways from "The Dark Descent": the sanity meter, the inventory and the oil/tinderboxes related difficulties have been removed, probably with the intent to create a more realistic atmosphere. A great limitation. This was not the best choice to me, since puzzles can't be satisfactorily complex and does not require much effort to be solved. Overall the gameplay result a little too linear but is compensated by a breathtaking atmosphere created by the story, the lovely and disturbing graphic, the dark sound environment and the superb music.\n"A Machine for Pigs" is a very compact and well designed game, that have only one misfortune: be the successor of a perfect game.

It’s definitely worthy of being in the Amnesia series though. If you've played the first game, I still recommend this one.

However, i did played The Chinese Room's previous game, Dear Ester, and thought it was pretty good. Now, A Machine for Pigs really isn't that scary. I played basically the entire campaign with headphones on and the lights off to amplify the horror, and honestly, there were only a few times it really scared me. But, that is not the main reason to play this game. A lot of people would say to play this game for the story, and while the story is good, it is pretty hard to follow at points. Important notes and journal entries are written in what seems like old english and at times can be hard to understand, but the basics are always there and you will pretty much have an idea what is going on as you make your way through the factory. The main reason i recommend this game is the atmosphere. It is a dark and dreary victorian-esq setting which works perfectly while traversing with solely an oil lamp. the mansion is looming and the factory is durty and desperate. The Chinese Room knows how important atmosphere can be in games like these and they really outdid themselves. Secondly, the level design is ♥♥♥♥ing amazing. There is so much potential to get lost in games like these, with dark corners and hallways everywhere. But somehow no matter how much i strayed and thought i turned myself around, i never did. The hallways are all connected geniously and bring you back where you need to be to further the story when you decide you want to go off the beaten path for a bit. Its crazy how well this is done and it makes the "dungeon crawling" a delight rather than a frustration.Overall, the game isnt that scary, but the story, atmosphere, and overall design make it a worthwile purchase.","January 7, 2014","true","6.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Four things really bother me about it...\n\n1) the lack of an inventory\n2) not being able to light candles lamps ect. (no tinderboxes)\n3) its to dark\n4) 90% of the game looks the same\n\nI originally thought the game was bugged.  I pressed every key trying to find the open inventory button, then I find out that you have no inventory, really?  Puzzles are solved by carrying the needed object which is more often then not very close to where you need to use it, making for an easy to solve (almost boring) puzzle system.  I liked in the dark decent how objects need to sometimes be carried long distances before you find a use for them *note the chemical puzzle in the dark decent, where you need to combine the 4 acids.*\n\nThe game takes place in 1899.  Electricity has just been invented and is not widely popular, so why is there so few candles and oil lamps?  No tinderboxes? no light-able light sources?  I think this is what I dislike most about the game.  In the original, players could light candles and torches whenever they feel insecure (which is most of the time).  In "a machine for pigs", its so dark and without the option to use light sources, after about 30min the player gets use to it, and the scary effect is lost.  Jump scares are one thing, and this game has many of them, but atmosphere is just as important.\n\nYou're given a battery powered lamp that never runs out of juice.  A good thing considering 90% of the game is almost pitch black.  However, I really wish they used an oil lamp instead.  Or even a battery powered lamp that runs out over time.  I liked in the first game how you needed to keep a close eye on your oil so you don't run out at a time when you need it most.  Back to the game being to dark...  In the first game there were really bright rooms occasionally, sometimes with the moon light shining in.  As you play the game and come across a room like this, its a breath of fresh air.  It makes you appreciate the dark rooms a whole lot more.  A nice change of atmosphere, keeps the game fresh and enjoyable to play.  A machine for pigs is pretty much dark all the time, get use to it...\n\nI understand that the game is based around old steam technology, which I found very appealing at first.  Especially the part where you have to start the massive steam engine.  Watching that huge flywheel turn around, gave me goosebumps.  Very well done on that part!  However 90% of the game looks the same.  Your constantly walking through maintenance corridors full of steam pipes.  It got dull very quickly.  I just wanted to see something green again, but it never happened.\n\nOverall, this game is worth checking out if your an amnesia fan.  If not, I would probably pass it by.  I don't regret buying it, but I probably wont play it a second time.","January 7, 2014","true","3.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

You are very rarely in any actual danger and even when you are, the game is very forgiving of failure. In many cases, you'll just respawn and the enemies will be gone. The sanity and lamp fuel mechanics of the original game have been removed too. You also have regenerating health. If you're looking for a traditional survival horror experience, A Machine For Pigs will likely disappoint you.\n\nThat said, if you're looking for an atmospheric and disturbing descent into madness, A Machine For Pigs does that pretty well. The story is twisted and interesting, if a bit predictable, and the environments always feels appropriately ominous. The game's audio is fantastic and really sets the mood. You may never truly fear for your life but the game's presentation will always leave you feeling unsettled.\n\nUltimately, A Machine For Pigs offers a better narrative experience than its predecessor, though the dumbed down gameplay is definitely a step back. If you're willing to overlook its mechanical failings and immerse yourself in the story and atmosphere, A Machine For Pigs is an enjoyable experience.","January 7, 2014","true","4.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

However, upon grabbing the lantern, I knew that this was going to be a horse of a different color. Unlike The Dark Descent, this game focuses more on its admittedly complecated story and does not have as many tense enemy moments. There is no item conservation, no oil, no health pickups, no sanity meter, and no direct connection to the first game. Unless you do some research, you will never find the connection between both Amnesia games. It's almost like the creators made a new game, but slapped Amnesia on the title just to lure fans of the original. The levels are more linear than the first game, so you may be disappointed that there is not a lot to explore. There is also the missing option to directly access custom stories from the main menu. In fact, this whole game is like a custom story that you would download for the first Amnesia.\n\nIf the game has these problems, why am I still recommending it? For one thing, it does have some pretty creepy moments. I found the factory setting to be gritty and atmospheric, almost like you could see the filth and decay that it is going through. If you were to think of how blood would crust up and stain the metal cogs and pipes of the machine, you would be in the right mindframe. Sound design is also great, as you will sometimes hear things from seemlingly nowhere. I played with headphones to immerse myself in the game, and that turned out to be a good choice. It wasn't a bad play, but it just doesn't measure up to the tense, dark, and forboding nature of the original Amnesia. For curiousity's sake, it's worth a play. Even if it is just for the familiar Amnesia atmosphere. However, I suggest that you buy this when it is on sale. I got it half-off around the holidays. In retrospect, that was a better choice because had I paid full price, I probably wouldn't be as forgiving to the game.\n\nIn conclusion, this game does not meet the same knee-jerk horror of the first one. It is average, but throws in some really good moments. If you are a die-hard Amnesia fan, you can skip this one. It does not have the same impact as the first game. If you are a fan of atmospheric, creepy-looking games, you would probably get some enjoyment out of it. Just wait for the game to go on sale. It is not worth $19.99.","March 24, 2014","true","5.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Everything that made Amnesia so unique has been removed. I enjoyed solving the little puzzles, but they presented no real challenge. I felt clever solving them, but after thinking back, the solutions were always very clear. So basically, they make you feel smart without you having to be smart.\nThe monsters on the other hand were just kinda there. I only died to them twice and that was becuase I was too busy fiddling about with machinery to realize they had spotted me. They grunt and wait a minute before beginning to chase you, so you can generally get away before they even start moving.\n\nStory:\nThis is the entire reason I'm reccomending the game. I loved the story. I'm going to try to explain why I loved it without spoiling anything.\nThe first thing I should probably note is that it was rather short. Major events were stuffed together too closely as they would be in a movie, not a game. In a movie, events are packed closely to keep the viewer from getting bored. For a game, you want some seperation between those because you can seperate them without the player getting bored. It increases how much time and entertainment the player is going to get out of the game.\nAside from that, I have no real gripes. I thoroughly enjoyed the story. It was written very well, and presented even better. The game's atmosphere was perfect and the story kept me interested and on my toes the whole time. Progressively learning all about this world I was thrown into is what kept me playing this game until the end.\n\nSo if you want to hear a nice story, this game is for you. If you're expecting another Amnesia game, however... You're not getting that from this game.","April 24, 2014","true","3.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I also don't think the opposing force of the game is as good as in Amnesia: The Dark Descent.\n\nIn my opinion (Yours may very well differ), 'A Machine for Pigs' is better than 'The Dark Descent' in some respects, but in most ways, I prefer the first in the series. I DON'T think this one will catch on as well as the first did (though I've been wrong before, we'll see), however I most certainly recommend it to those who enjoyed the first one! Like I said, it's very memorable, touches on some historical facts of the time, as well as insight into 'future' events, and WILL make you think on occasion. I'm glad I played it, and might possibly play it again some time later on.\n\nHad a few good scary and suspenseful parts in it, and hopefully some talented modders will perform some similar magic for this platform as they have for the last one. As is the game has a GREAT feel/atmosphere to it, I don't think that can be improved upon, however as far as scariness goes I believe we can expect some improvements by the upcoming fanbase. People smarter than I who would know how to create mods and really make people quiver. Come on, give Storpy, Pewds, Markiplier, and the rest of the popular youtube gamers something to scream about ;)\n\nI hope you found this recommendation (and kind of review?) informative! Happy gaming!","September 10, 2013","true","4.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It kind of felt that the game will be like Dark Descent, Unfortunately after you see the monster first time, the scary atmosphere kind of vanishes because the monster itself isnt so scary. Tough the few jumpscares and "ONE" particular monster keeps scaring you, i was really disappointed of the "Horror" part oh this game. If we compare Amnesia: DD and MfP as horror games, it feels like MfP isnt horror game at all. I would more likely categorize it as agonizing game. Few things what makes it lose its Scary feeling is that you have lamb WITHOUT oil meter, Wich means you can use your lamb all the time without worrying that your oil will suddenly end. There is no need to hide in closet, because when you use your light and those "monsters" are getting close to you it starts to go on and off. When you are near monsters it flashes fast so you know that you need to turn your light off and just go littlebit backwards behind some boxes or barrels and wait until it walks past you.\n\nTough the game itself doesnt seem to be so scary it has amazing story in it. At the beginning of the game you really cant get into it so well but if you keep following it and you listen all the conversations and read all the notes what you find you soon notice how depressing and oppressive it is, and how much the game offers you with its story. The story of this game is only reason why i would recomend this game for people. The horror part of this game seems to be so small that i would more likely keep it as nice extra for this story what you play. In my opinion Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs is more one depressing and oppressive but still amazing story, wich have few puzzles and some jumpscares and horror scenes in it.\n\nIm gonna give thumbs up for this game only because of its story.For this game as a horror game im gonna give in my scale just 5/10. i really didnt  like it at all.. BUT! as walktrough of Story im gonna give it 8,8/10. I really enjoyed this game after i just forget the thing that it "sould be" horror game and just focused more the story. So in my opinion, If you are looking for nice Horror game this game get tumbs down. It really isnt worth of money.. But if you wanna game with story then Yes. I highly recommend it for you.","April 23, 2014","true","4.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

This is probably becuase of The Chinese Rooms role as developer, but their involvement is also what made the game great.\n\nThe setting was really well thought out and looks great, The atmosphere was very effective, the story was really deep and though provoking, and the soundtrack was absolutely amazing (mostly).

Everything that made Amnesia so unique has been removed. I enjoyed solving the little puzzles, but they presented no real challenge. I felt clever solving them, but after thinking back, the solutions were always very clear. So basically, they make you feel smart without you having to be smart.\nThe monsters on the other hand were just kinda there. I only died to them twice and that was becuase I was too busy fiddling about with machinery to realize they had spotted me. They grunt and wait a minute before beginning to chase you, so you can generally get away before they even start moving.\n\nStory:\nThis is the entire reason I'm reccomending the game. I loved the story. I'm going to try to explain why I loved it without spoiling anything.\nThe first thing I should probably note is that it was rather short. Major events were stuffed together too closely as they would be in a movie, not a game. In a movie, events are packed closely to keep the viewer from getting bored. For a game, you want some seperation between those because you can seperate them without the player getting bored. It increases how much time and entertainment the player is going to get out of the game.\nAside from that, I have no real gripes. I thoroughly enjoyed the story. It was written very well, and presented even better. The game's atmosphere was perfect and the story kept me interested and on my toes the whole time. Progressively learning all about this world I was thrown into is what kept me playing this game until the end.\n\nSo if you want to hear a nice story, this game is for you. If you're expecting another Amnesia game, however... You're not getting that from this game.","April 24, 2014","true","3.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Not the trivial horror in which the player is always firing with a shotgun, but a deep and perverse psychological experience that dig into the player's darkest thoughts. This second chapter differs in many ways from "The Dark Descent": the sanity meter, the inventory and the oil/tinderboxes related difficulties have been removed, probably with the intent to create a more realistic atmosphere. A great limitation. This was not the best choice to me, since puzzles can't be satisfactorily complex and does not require much effort to be solved. Overall the gameplay result a little too linear but is compensated by a breathtaking atmosphere created by the story, the lovely and disturbing graphic, the dark sound environment and the superb music.\n"A Machine for Pigs" is a very compact and well designed game, that have only one misfortune: be the successor of a perfect game. A lot of people didn't expect Amnesia to change it's way of being.\nI replayed this game 3 times now and I would definitely recommend it.","July 1, 2014","true","7.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

(MFP)\n\nNow, let me note that there are tons of reviews, saying that this game is bad and such, Some reviews say its bad only\nbecause its not so 'spoopy' as The Dark Descent (TDD), And well... I disagree,\n\nIt is true that the game isnt as scary or Interactable as the first one, But when you think about it... Frictional games have made games that tell stories, And yes, This WASNT made by them, But it is their franchise.\nI personally think that  The Chinese Room [thechineseroom.co.uk] Did a fantastic job on this game.\n\nNow, Yes, MFP isnt as interactable, But I can see why. If you were delivering a story, you wouldnt want players wandering off\nwith a statue and giving it a name  cough cough , Instead you'd want the player to enjoy the story.\n\nNow, TDD Was story based, yes, but it delivered scares that made you want to just pause the game and nope out of your room, But then again... Did you hear   HEY MAN, AMNESIA THE DARK DESCENT'S STORYLINE IS SO GOOD?\nNo, You didnt.\n\nAll I heard about TDD was that it was a spooky ♥♥♥ game, Not only until later when I played it that it was rich with lore, Story, and even other things.\n\nNow,   The Chinese Room [thechineseroom.co.uk] did just that, They took away most of the spooky stuff and threw the story straight at you...\n\nNow by throwing it at you, I dont mean it was rushed,  Although the game was four hours...  It told it's story at a believeable pace, and it just made you feel uncomfortable from your surroundings.\n\nAnd another thing I liked about this game was the sound track, I mean...  Listen to this beautiful piano piece!  The game delivered it's gritty dark story in a great way.\n\nYes, They however did take out some of the main systems, such as the insanity system, But then again it made the story harder to reach to, But does that justify the fact that they removed it? No, I believe it was unnecassary to remove the Insanity system.\n\nNow, For the story... MFP just drops you in a large house, Call it a mansion if you'd like, Only to find out your children are missing... And of course, Amnesia.  It's not like Daniel in TDD, But I guess... Short term amnesia?\nNow, off to find Edwin and Enoch in your mysteriously abandoned town, and once you find the machine... Idunno man, Play it.\n\nNow, away from my ♥♥♥♥♥♥ story review, I believe what mattered the most to the Chinese room was the Story, and damn did they deliver it in a great way, in a dark and gritty world.\n\nPotato/10, There is no slaughter machine for pigs.","June 7, 2014","true","4.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","2"

You really don't do much in the way of normal gaming during your experience with Pigs. However, you will find yourself engaged by what you might call narrative/ambient puzzle solving. You aren't asked to find a clever way around a locked door, or trick enemies into sucide, or rearrange parts of a painting to reveal a secret message. Instead, the intellectual satisfaction you'll find in Pigs comes from examining the game's environment and reading cryptic journal entries to understand this narrative's disturbing truths. That is, running through the game without paying enough attention and without thinking critically enough will result in failure--you will have missed the game's point. It's in careful methodic analysis of the narrative elements that you win and experience the pleasure of the game's reward--deep fear and revulsion about your character's tale and even what the story says about the nature of our own lives.\n\nI believe this game's only material shortcoming is technical--it is deceptively resource intensive, despite its lack of visual sophistication. It's not particularly pretty (Outlast, however, is particularly pretty), but slowdown is frequent nonetheless. Routinely, the frame rate would dip on my pc, from around 60fps to something closer to 30fps. I'm not sure if this is the result of visual tricks that I simply didn't appreciate enough to notice, or if it's because of less-than-optimized code. Vision blur never triggered the slowdown. Slowdown occurred most often in the large, more decorated rooms of Mandus's mansion, and in some of the larger chambers below.\n\nPlay this game, though. Its terror doesn't come from visceral, instinctual tension as it does through Dead Space and Outlast. Instead, it disturbs the conscious mind only after reflection and understanding of the story's premise. You won't spend your time with Pigs with white knuckles and a tight stomach. Instead, you will spend days afterward dwelling on dread and the loathing you were meant to feel through Mandus as he rediscovered his own past.","June 10, 2014","true","6.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rorulon/recommended/239200/","rorulon","Young Steev","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rorulon/","244 products in account","The good -\n- The machine you descend into and explore is beautifully realised, as you watch huge mechanisms working away in the vast darkness around you it really drives home the sense of isolation and loneliness. Much like Dear Esther, the game is very linear but it allows the designers to craft a detailed world for the player to explore.\n- The sound design and music is probably A Machine for Pigs' best feature. The rumbling and groaning machine feels alive as you move through it, and little stings of music serve to build the atmosphere. The snippets of dialogue both found throughout the game and uttered by the main character as he explores are well acted and clearly depict a man who has lost his mind.\n- Machine for Pigs is not a fun or enjoyable experience, but it isn't meant to be. Thechineseroom have crafted a story that will make the player feel a range of emotions - as well as terror and revulsion, there are elements of empathy and even pity at certain points. While it ends rather abruptly the story gels with the sound design and creates an experience that, while not exactly fun, definitely stirs up something.\n\nThe bad -\n- The game can be finished in less than 5 hours and there is no reason to play through it again. The ability to jump to certain chapters is redundant as its like picking up a book and starting several chapters in, stripping away the context that's needed for this game.\n- From the start of the game to its conclusion you are on a linear path. Even exterior locations are simply tunnels, skyboxes and events that render alternate paths closed off. There are a couple of simple puzzles throughout the game but nothing compared to the item gathering and riddle solving puzzles of The Dark Descent.\n- A lot of the fear in The Dark Descent came from showing you fleeting glimpses of the unknown and letting your mind fill in the gaps. While Machine for Pigs does this early on, it quickly reveals the unknown and tries to take a different angle on the horror. While it works in some ways, simple mechanics like managing your sanity levels and conserving your light, hallmarks of The Dark Descent and a great way to build terror in the player, are completely stripped out.\n\nPersonal Highlights (contains spoilers) -\n- Learning the true purpose of the machine. Although never explicitly stated, by putting the pieces together you will understand its true nature, and the revelation will sicken you...\n- The holding cells of the Pigmen is a unique experience. Walking through the halls and looking into the cells makes you realise these horrible monsters patrolling the machine are actually semi-intellingent, or at least sentient, and the conditions they live in, as well as the human element of their cells, conjures up a feeling of pity towards what was your main antagonist.\n- The "escape" scenario where the Pigmen are released on the streets of London to ravage and cause chaos is a personal highlight, not because it's good, but because its a great example of how to completely ruin and stop the story dead. Its the lowest part of the story and doesn't really serve anything to the plot.\n\nSummary -\nAn unfortunate miss from thechineseroom. A Machine for Pigs isn't a terrible game, in fact in some areas it can come off as a more horrific and disturbing game than its predecessor. It gets under the skin and the story leave a lot to the player's imagination to drive the horror home. The machine itself feels colossal and largely unknown, and the music and sound design helps to immerse the player in this horrible world. Unfortunately the linear nature of the game makes it feel like a guided tour, and a sudden and abrupt ending jars with the slow buildup of the preceding few hours.\nThechineseroom can craft a great story, and to that end they've succeeded, but for all their ambiguity, clever dialogue and creative vision, a game without mechanics, even simple puzzle solving, is not a game, its a tour of a 3D model put into context. A good horror game in its own right, but hardly deserving of the Amnesia name.\n\n5/10\n\nContext - 8\nChallenge - 2\nCatharsis - 4","January 3, 2014","true","4.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

There is very little 'horror' in the game itself. The Dark Descent was terrifying, it scared me so bad I could only play the game in half hour bursts at max. The chase music was terrifying, being terrified to even look around a corner drew me in. A machine for pigs has none of these things. The atmosphere was great! But that does not make up for the lack of pure terror you felt as the chase music screamed at you (A Machine for Pigs has no real chase music) when you were being chased by a monster like what happened in the Dark Descent. A Machine for Pigs simplifies much of the gameplay from the Dark Descent. You have an unlimited light source (which I feel takes away from the fear as well as you never need to worry about running out of light), simpler puzzles, no sanity meter (arguably better, arguably not) and no inventory.\n\nA Machine for Pigs has great atmosphere, the plot is intriguing, but the horror elements that made the Dark Descent great just aren't there - and it's a huge disappointment.","July 11, 2014","false","7.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Four things really bother me about it...\n\n1) the lack of an inventory\n2) not being able to light candles lamps ect. (no tinderboxes)\n3) its to dark\n4) 90% of the game looks the same\n\nI originally thought the game was bugged.  I pressed every key trying to find the open inventory button, then I find out that you have no inventory, really?  Puzzles are solved by carrying the needed object which is more often then not very close to where you need to use it, making for an easy to solve (almost boring) puzzle system.  I liked in the dark decent how objects need to sometimes be carried long distances before you find a use for them *note the chemical puzzle in the dark decent, where you need to combine the 4 acids.*\n\nThe game takes place in 1899.  Electricity has just been invented and is not widely popular, so why is there so few candles and oil lamps?  No tinderboxes? no light-able light sources?  I think this is what I dislike most about the game.  In the original, players could light candles and torches whenever they feel insecure (which is most of the time).  In "a machine for pigs", its so dark and without the option to use light sources, after about 30min the player gets use to it, and the scary effect is lost.  Jump scares are one thing, and this game has many of them, but atmosphere is just as important.\n\nYou're given a battery powered lamp that never runs out of juice.  A good thing considering 90% of the game is almost pitch black.  However, I really wish they used an oil lamp instead.  Or even a battery powered lamp that runs out over time.  I liked in the first game how you needed to keep a close eye on your oil so you don't run out at a time when you need it most.  Back to the game being to dark...  In the first game there were really bright rooms occasionally, sometimes with the moon light shining in.  As you play the game and come across a room like this, its a breath of fresh air.  It makes you appreciate the dark rooms a whole lot more.  A nice change of atmosphere, keeps the game fresh and enjoyable to play.  A machine for pigs is pretty much dark all the time, get use to it...\n\nI understand that the game is based around old steam technology, which I found very appealing at first.  Especially the part where you have to start the massive steam engine.  Watching that huge flywheel turn around, gave me goosebumps.  Very well done on that part!  However 90% of the game looks the same.  Your constantly walking through maintenance corridors full of steam pipes.  It got dull very quickly.  I just wanted to see something green again, but it never happened.\n\nOverall, this game is worth checking out if your an amnesia fan.  If not, I would probably pass it by.  I don't regret buying it, but I probably wont play it a second time.","January 7, 2014","true","3.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

You are very rarely in any actual danger and even when you are, the game is very forgiving of failure. In many cases, you'll just respawn and the enemies will be gone. The sanity and lamp fuel mechanics of the original game have been removed too. You also have regenerating health. If you're looking for a traditional survival horror experience, A Machine For Pigs will likely disappoint you.\n\nThat said, if you're looking for an atmospheric and disturbing descent into madness, A Machine For Pigs does that pretty well. The story is twisted and interesting, if a bit predictable, and the environments always feels appropriately ominous. The game's audio is fantastic and really sets the mood. You may never truly fear for your life but the game's presentation will always leave you feeling unsettled.\n\nUltimately, A Machine For Pigs offers a better narrative experience than its predecessor, though the dumbed down gameplay is definitely a step back. If you're willing to overlook its mechanical failings and immerse yourself in the story and atmosphere, A Machine For Pigs is an enjoyable experience.","January 7, 2014","true","4.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

However, upon grabbing the lantern, I knew that this was going to be a horse of a different color. Unlike The Dark Descent, this game focuses more on its admittedly complecated story and does not have as many tense enemy moments. There is no item conservation, no oil, no health pickups, no sanity meter, and no direct connection to the first game. Unless you do some research, you will never find the connection between both Amnesia games. It's almost like the creators made a new game, but slapped Amnesia on the title just to lure fans of the original. The levels are more linear than the first game, so you may be disappointed that there is not a lot to explore. There is also the missing option to directly access custom stories from the main menu. In fact, this whole game is like a custom story that you would download for the first Amnesia.\n\nIf the game has these problems, why am I still recommending it? For one thing, it does have some pretty creepy moments. I found the factory setting to be gritty and atmospheric, almost like you could see the filth and decay that it is going through. If you were to think of how blood would crust up and stain the metal cogs and pipes of the machine, you would be in the right mindframe. Sound design is also great, as you will sometimes hear things from seemlingly nowhere. I played with headphones to immerse myself in the game, and that turned out to be a good choice. It wasn't a bad play, but it just doesn't measure up to the tense, dark, and forboding nature of the original Amnesia. For curiousity's sake, it's worth a play. Even if it is just for the familiar Amnesia atmosphere. However, I suggest that you buy this when it is on sale. I got it half-off around the holidays. In retrospect, that was a better choice because had I paid full price, I probably wouldn't be as forgiving to the game.\n\nIn conclusion, this game does not meet the same knee-jerk horror of the first one. It is average, but throws in some really good moments. If you are a die-hard Amnesia fan, you can skip this one. It does not have the same impact as the first game. If you are a fan of atmospheric, creepy-looking games, you would probably get some enjoyment out of it. Just wait for the game to go on sale. It is not worth $19.99.","March 24, 2014","true","5.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The fear and anxiety caused by The Dark Descent is replaced by an unlimitted supply of light and mental clarity. The game itself often feels more laid back and common place. It relies on atmospheric horror rather than a genuine threat to your so called digital life. While The Dark Descent left me shreiking this game only gives me a subtle jump on the rarest of occasions. This is mostly due to my own mental anticipation which proves to be wasted effort in and of itself. In spite of this, I cannot seem to put down the game. It's redeeming feature lies in the fact that it is truly "A Machine for Pigs". The atmospheric story telling keeps me navigating each passage and slowly bringing the factory to life. As I chase after apparitions it leads me to question my own humanity. In fact, the beasts in this game are strangley human compared to the character I find myself trapped in.

For my part, I really enjoyed this one, even if it made some noticable changes to the way the game plays.\n\nIn this new Amnesia, you will no longer have to manage resources.  The inventory and sanity systems are gone, and your latern never runs out of fuel (it does flicker however, when enemies are nearby, which is a good touch).  Personally, I don't mind any of these changes because it fits the style that A Machine for Pigs is going for.  It wants to be a more brooding and atmospheric game with a bigger focus on the story, and forcing you to deal with sanity and the like would be counterproductive.\n\nBut despite that, there is one change I cannot understand: the limitation of physical interaction with your environment.  In the first game, you could pick up many different objects lying around the environment and toss them around.  Aside from helping with puzzle solving, it was a good way to immerse you in your surroundings.  But in A Machine for Pigs, many of the objects you see are just static, which bothers me especially because there's sometimes no good logic for which ones can or cannot be interacted with.\n\nEven so, I could recommend this game based solely on the environment and story alone.  The environment is awesome.  The rumble of an giant unearthly machine spinning to life below your feet and shaking the mansion you start the game in is something to truly behold.  The various steampunk influences on the environment are clearly visible, especially later in the game as you start going underground.  The story is also something to behold.  Compared to the first game, the story of A Machine for Pigs is probably its strongest point.  It's a twisted tale of loss, redemption, madness, and hits on some themes you probably won't see coming.  After completing the game, I couldn't get it out of my head for weeks.  It may start slow, but the final hour of the game is worth it (the entire game took me five hours or so to beat).  It's a tale of psychological horror you won't soon forget.\n\nThe implications of being a sequel to what many call the scariest game ever made are big.  A Machine for Pigs may not be the Amnesia sequel many people wanted, but as a game in its own right it stands as something incredibly deep and thought-provoking.  The gameplay may not be as complicated as the original, but the story and atmosphere are both incredible experiences.  Playing the first game is not required to enjoy the story, although there are some references you won't understand if you haven't played it, and it definitely gives certain things a new context.  My final verdict: recommended for those with an open-mind and a love for complex and thought-provoking stories.\n\n","January 8, 2014","true","17.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

They took out the Inventory aspect of the game which means no Tinderboxes, no items, and no Journal. They kept the Health feature, but they made no way to check it. I am not sure if they still kept the sanity effect, but i'm sure they did. The only "item" you will ever pick up is the Lantern. But besides the mediocre puzzles, lack of inventory and sanity, the game was still scary. Overall i give it a 8/10. Although they shouldve called it something else instead of Amnesia.

The extent of the 'puzzles' in Machine for Pigs is finding the correct lever and giving it a swift tug. There, puzzle complete. Unlike the previous Amnesia game you cannot pick up in game objects other than chairs in a few areas. The developers disabled the ability to pick up objects - very hastily I might add, as you can still knock things over with chairs and easily cause other "nailed down" props to glitch out. Throughout the game the ambience tries to be spooky but due to the limitations of the game there is no sense of danger. When you are confronted with the monsters you'll laugh or even stare with your eyes half-open at the pathetic excuse of a threat. They are slow and give you plenty of opportunity to run away, and its not very hard to just walk around them when they see you. The new 'lamp' in the game flickers to notify you when a monster is near, which might've worked in a game like FEAR when the atmosphere and the script were above average, but not in a poorly written, poorly built game like this. They took out the paranoia features that the first game had, as well as the tinderboxes and lamp oil. The player doesn't even have any health potions, or any item to retrieve for that matter, which means there's no reason to explore the map other than to look for scraps of paper with sappy dialogue. I expected this game to be an excellent addition to the Amnesia universe, but TheChineseRoom failed in every possible way to make this game worthy of its title. Might've been better if it was designed as a standalone game instead of being directly related to Amnesia. (Note: same universe sequel, not story continuing sequel. Barely any crossovers. Absolutely no reason to have Amnesia in the title.)\n\nI really hope TheChineseRoom learns from their mistakes with this game.","November 25, 2013","false","3.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

DO NOT purchase this game based off The Dark Descent. This game, even though it has ties to the first game, is an entirely different experience in itself. DO purchase this game for a very in depth story that you will love once you understand it. The Chinese Room did very well in the presentation of the plot line, be very attentive to all dialogue and notes and be very sure to try and connect all points of the story to truly understand. This game does not rely on quality scares, it relies on the environment and plot points to make something worth following.

The extent of the 'puzzles' in Machine for Pigs is finding the correct lever and giving it a swift tug. There, puzzle complete. Unlike the previous Amnesia game you cannot pick up in game objects other than chairs in a few areas. The developers disabled the ability to pick up objects - very hastily I might add, as you can still knock things over with chairs and easily cause other "nailed down" props to glitch out. Throughout the game the ambience tries to be spooky but due to the limitations of the game there is no sense of danger. When you are confronted with the monsters you'll laugh or even stare with your eyes half-open at the pathetic excuse of a threat. They are slow and give you plenty of opportunity to run away, and its not very hard to just walk around them when they see you. The new 'lamp' in the game flickers to notify you when a monster is near, which might've worked in a game like FEAR when the atmosphere and the script were above average, but not in a poorly written, poorly built game like this. They took out the paranoia features that the first game had, as well as the tinderboxes and lamp oil. The player doesn't even have any health potions, or any item to retrieve for that matter, which means there's no reason to explore the map other than to look for scraps of paper with sappy dialogue. I expected this game to be an excellent addition to the Amnesia universe, but TheChineseRoom failed in every possible way to make this game worthy of its title. Might've been better if it was designed as a standalone game instead of being directly related to Amnesia. (Note: same universe sequel, not story continuing sequel. Barely any crossovers. Absolutely no reason to have Amnesia in the title.)\n\nI really hope TheChineseRoom learns from their mistakes with this game.","November 25, 2013","false","3.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Новая серия Амнезии никак не связана с предыдущей. Что это за конфетка и стоит ли её кушать? йа вам сейчас расскажу\n1)Сюжет\nОн в отличии от оригинала запутан.

Сразу скажу щто концовку данного творения йа не смог до конца понять...Могу только догадываться. Но в целом он довольно интересен\n2)Графика\nОна не сильно изменилась. HPL2 Engine... тут его исполнения меня не удивило. Но из за мрачного освещения на всех локациях, наслодиться почти нечем\n3)Геймплей\nТут разработчики меня удивили... и йа сам не понял в какую сторону. Убрали инвентарь...Убрали здоровье и мозги... убрали самоконтроль(ужас) без него ничего не видно когды на корточках сидишь с выключенным фанарём... ну хоть бесконечный фанарь есть.

This game might not be worth the 20 dollars, but it sure is terrifying. I can't tell most of the scares without spoiling too much of the game. Personally, I think Frictional Games should have gone with a different developer instead of The Chinese Room. They basically made it a sequel to Dear Esther. They took out the Inventory aspect of the game which means no Tinderboxes, no items, and no Journal. They kept the Health feature, but they made no way to check it. I am not sure if they still kept the sanity effect, but i'm sure they did. The only "item" you will ever pick up is the Lantern. But besides the mediocre puzzles, lack of inventory and sanity, the game was still scary. Overall i give it a 8/10. Although they shouldve called it something else instead of Amnesia. This game doesn't maintain all the features that the first one did. That is what made Amnesia, Amnesia.

I think A Machine for Pigs is a master stroke in video game horror and storytelling. I consider it a far more captivating experience than The Dark Descent. Where TDD relied more on chase scenes and jump scares, AMFP focused far more on crafting a dark, Lovecraftian world to enthrall the player with.\n\nA Machine for Pigs drops the tiresome sanity meter, which at no point in its predecessor enhanced the experience. This artificial system only served to remove me from the experience. It accomplished nothing but making you feel like your character was extremely drunk. AFMP, on the other hand, approaches the question of sanity organically within the game. You will encounter situations that will make you question your character's sanity and perhaps even your own. Along with losing the sanity meter, it curbed the need for tinderboxes and oil because your lantern is permanently powered now. At no point did I consider this a weakness of the game. Collecting oil and tinderboxes was practically useless in the original even with the lighting settings correctly calibrated.\n\nThe soundscape in this game is truly stellar. The music is haunting and beautiful and greatly adds to the atmosphere of the game. Outside of the music, it has superb sound effects. From the groans and shrieks of the machinery to the otherwordly sounds that come from the pigs, it is all done superbly.\n\nIn another contrast to its predecessor, this game has far less focus on puzzles. And this is another thing that seems to have been very controversial for people. My reply is that this is a horror game. It is not a puzzle game. Puzzle games do not need to have horror sections. Why do horror games need to have puzzle sections? Beyond that, let's not kid ourselves about the puzzles in TDD. They were infantile and even the most challenged player could solve them easily without consulting a walkthrough. So let's not act like this series is famed for its amazing puzzles.\n\nIt is not without its problems, though, It is a very short game. I completed it in 3.4 hours on my first playthrough and that was with seeking out everything and reading everything. While I consider it worth it even at full price, it is still quite a flaw. Another problem is that you cannot back track, so you have to make certain you fully explore an area before trying to move on or you will miss stuff.\n\nStill, this game is amazing. I completely adore it and hope that people will look past all the unwarranted negative reviews it has received. It is superior to The Dark Descent by far.","June 5, 2014","true","3.5"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Not an amnesia title.\n\nMy conclusion? Even as its own game, I personally hated it.\n\nWhy:\nBecause it failed to involve me whatsoever with its story. It seemed to want to completely distance itself from the player. That's what books and movies are for, and they do it better because they can frame and pace it in an interesting way. In a game, you NEED interaction to make it interesting. Machine for pigs is a series of (more often than not) scripted events, and long periods of nothing happening.\n\nSure, the environment is impressive. And without threats, or any need for resource gathering, it feels empty. I felt little or no desire to explore it, and there was rarely any form of reward for doing so. One might argue that this makes for a lonely, isolated experience that enhances the fear factor. One might also seek art in something that took little or no skill to craft, because it makes them look or feel more intelligent for doing so. While the environment LOOKS nice, I personally feel that it failed to generate a genuine sense of place. Places have character. Secrets, AI, readables, married together with visual storytelling and sound design, are ingredients for imaginary worlds we call "games". Places CONTAIN things. Events. They are  living things! While AMFP has some of these elements, its missing the most vital ones, and finds pretentious little ways of ruining the stuff that does work. Forced subtitles for posters, for example...because I can't just read it on my own...did Bioshock ever do that?\n\nA machine for pigs never felt living...it was a hollow experience. The story alone is not enough to save it from that. It could have been a novel, and would have been better for it. There is little to nothing that justifies it being a game. While I don't like the whole debate on what the definition of a game is (as it's quite subjective), I feel that a bad game is one that doesn't make effective use of the advantages this medium offers. Interactivity! The Stanley Parable featured nothing but walking, but it still made the player feel like they were somehow interacting with it. Making choices, finding things, etc. AMFP really failed to FEEL like a game for me, so I can only call it a bad one.\n\nFor the sake of the things the game did right, I wanted to like it. But I couldn't. There was no reason this amazing environment couldn't have at least had more interactivity than walking and pressing buttons, with occasional glimmers of actual gameplay when a rare enemy was present.\n\nThe jumpscares often amounted to nothing, and it wasn't long before I was shrugging them off. It wasn't much longer before I was feeling bored. Eventually, after an evening of giving this game a chance, I simply got too bored to finish. The story didn't intrigue me so much that I needed to finish. Had it felt like I was experiencing the story, as oppoed to feeling dissasociated with it, that could have been different. I'm often more leniant with gameplay issues for games I feel have a good story, such as deadly premonition (though I see no reason a game can't have both up to scratch!). This was simply a case where there was nothing to make the story worth it. It didn't grab my attention as much as it kept me mildly curious. It wasn't enough to make me want to endure any more boredom.\n\nFor these reasons, I can only call this a bad game that I want to like, but frankly can't. Forgetting that it's connected to amnesia in any way, I just feel this is bad. It's a poor use of the medium that is unjustifiable, and really ought to have been a novel instead.\n\nIf you enjoyed the game and found something of value to you in it, that's great and I'm glad you enjoyed it. This is just my honest feelings, and I'm aware that one man's junk is another mans treasure. If you enjoyed Dear Esther, chances are you'll enjoy this. I hated that game also for the same reasons, so that should give you a good idea of what to expect.","January 29, 2014","false","3.7"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

It barely has any character involvement at all. The environment and music are beautiful as they are in Dear Esther, and that makese sense. It's the same developers and the same composer, respectively. The story is also very well written but you won't be able to appreciate it unless you can find the majority of the notes. And that's the only real thing to actually DO in it, besides the occasional simple, boring puzzle and avoiding the occasional pigman who will only spawn at scripted moments and will usually follow a set path, moving around stacks of crates or through hallways. It's only a matter of timing to avoid them. There is no survival elements either, further negating the actual danger in the game and making for poor payoff for the well-designed atmopshere. If this game had all the good elements in it's own right, the story, music, atmosphere and level design as well certain aspects of the first game such as the unpredictable enemies, survival mechanics and intillectually stimulating puzzles I would have appreciated it much more.

First and foremost Machine for Pigs is nothing like Amensia: the Dark Descent, so much so that I refuse to even it call it an Amnesia title.  Don't expect this to even marginally resemble Amensia: the Dark Descent because you will be sorely disappointed.\n\nEverything that made the original what it is known as today, a well designed and terrifying horror experience start to finish, is non-existant in Machine for Pigs.  There is no more health, sanity, lantern fluid and tinderbox necessities and there isn't even a means to examine what condition you're in after you suffer physical damage from enemies.  There is also no inventory to store the very few items you come across.  Granted, the only items you ever need to pick up are obviously only to solve puzzles, if you can even call them that because all they really involve is picking up an item and inserting it into whatever contraption.  There isn't anything puzzling whatsoever.\n\nOne final thought on items is that you must literally carry them in your hands to where they need to go, again, because there is no inventory.  Not a huge deal, however it is  bothersome nonetheless especially if you accidentally drop something and have to go look for it.  All of this  has been removed and I would love to know what the developers were thinking when they made these decisions.\n\nI do wish Frictional Games, Amnesia: the Dark Descent's developers would have gone through and created Machine for Pigs; the Chinese Room evidently had no idea what they got themselves into.  Ultimately Machine for Pigs does not live up the hype its predecessor proved and is an astounding failure in comparison and if it were a standalone title too.  It is no more than a dumbed-down, unbearably linear walking simulator with the occasional half-arsed jumpscare thrown in to laughably try and capture an ounce of horror. I'd suggest avoiding this altogether unless you just need to say that you finished both Amnesia titles.\n\n2/10","January 8","false","5.5"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

The enviornment was perfect everything seemed very beautiful, the textures were very nice, And the use of a Slaughter house was quite creepy. AAMFP did seem like it was going to be a lot better than it turned out to be because of all the hype given to it. But the story and setting(in my mind) exeeded the hype given. The was that the lantern flickers at the sight of an enemy was pretty creative, it made the game a lot more scary because I had no clue what happened when my lattern started to flip the ♥♥♥♥ out. So if you are looking for probably the best story I have seen in a game for a long time, BUY THIS GAME I DO RECOMMEND IT.\n\nPART 2 a stand point of "buying the game for the gameplay".\nI would NOT recommend this game to anyone who wants a horror game with good gameplay. If you want great gameplay play ATDD the first Amnesia. AAMFP was alot easier than ATDD and you weren't able to up the difficulty in anyway at all I know of and I looked into it for a good while. I felt like I could just walk straight through everything only hiding a few times throughout the game. I ATDD you didn't have that feeling you had to be a bit more careful and there was some more skill involved it was as much of a story game even though it had a very nice story, i feel the gameplay was better than the story. If you are looking ot buy a game for gameplay DO NOT BUY THIS GAME, it does not add any more to the original story of ATDD and it just seems easy and like the mosters and just their to make you take more time to finish the game, I found all the puzzles to be very easy giving minimal problems.\n\nOVERALL: Overall I think that AAMFP is a great game because I perfer to play through games for their story and AAMFP has a beautiful story.\nHighly recommended!\n\nI would give this game a solid 9 pigs out of 10.","November 25, 2013","true","4.1"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

Jump-scares are substituted in place of tension and carefully layered atmosphere, The world feels less interactive and explorable, and the whole expereince feels like the subtlety has been stripped out, when compared to the original.\n\n\n\nMachine for Pigs almost exclusively tries to startle you rather than frighten you. The problem with this is that being startled is a physical reaction, being frightened is an emotional one: and I think most would agree a more satisfying one in a horror game.\n\n\n\nThe only situation I think someone would prefer this game to the first one is if they are unfamiliar with computer games in general and find it distracting to have to manage lantern oil, inventory, sanity etc. All of these have been removed from the game.\n\n\n\nI picked this up from Humble Bundle and so I hardly spent anything to buy it, I would not recommend this if you are paying full price.","October 30, 2014","false","13.9"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

Clocking in at about three hours long, the conclusion to the game is rushed and the enemies do not provide the same tension those in the first game do, especially with the removal of the terror metre and insanity scale. Enemies are easily shaken off and the AI is painfully dumb: taking far too long to react when light is being shone directly on them from a few feet away.\n\nThe puzzles are likewise easier this time around, the most challenging of them being shining a light on a tube of chemicals to generate electricity. It is all very straight forward, and the story the game tells isn't nearly as intricate as it's predacessor.\n\nThe game would be scarier if they had more 'enemies' than pigmen and tesla pigmen, both of which you will find ridiculous to several degrees upon examination. While not a bad game by any stretch of imagination, it failed to deliver the horror aspect completely after the first few minutes of gameplay, and I felt that too much of the game takes place without seeing a single enemy (the first enemy you encounter is 30-45 minutes in, and there is little tension building prior to this.

The gameplay and game style are different for sure, not to say that it's all bad. A machine for pigs is a lot more psycological in horror than The Dark Descent, and doesn't use monsters or jump scares to get to you, instead it uses its atomosphere, and tries to be more subtle about it, which admittingly worked on me. That being said, don't play this game if you're just looking for a good scare, its closer to adventure than horror, and it definitely feels like you encounter less monsters than you do in its predecessor.

A Machine for Pigs is a lot darker than the previous installment and the features they took out from the first game aren't actually necessary for A Machine for Pigs.\n\nThe game is a lot more story driven and is written beautifully, the eerie sense that the machine gives is full of dread and claustrophobia. This is also supported by the game's soundtrack, which is one of the few game soundtracks I have bought.\nJessica Curry's soundtrack written for the game is some of the best horror music I've ever heard out of any form of horror, whether it be movies or other games.\n\nThis being said, a good majority of the time I was frightened by the music and found myself screaming for it to stop. (Locked inside my dorm room by myself with no lights whatsoever is really the only way to play a horror game).\n\nIn conclusion, this shouldn't be compared to the first game at all. It would be rather dull if the predecessor of a game was exactly like the new one coming out and the creators should not be shunned for trying something different, especially when the game industry has recently been pumping out AAA titles that are no different than the previous games they have made.\n\nPersonally, I enjoyed this game a lot more than the first Amnesia, it's different yes, but it's a whole new flavor, one that people may or may not like depending on their idea of horror.","January 7, 2014","true","7.8"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

Any horror Machine for Pigs delivers is through it's dark, forboding atmosphere and excellent sound design.

This is not the same type of game.\n\nThis is more or less a lot like Dear Eshter, a mod made into game, that is simply you walking around listening to stories by the narrator.\n\nIn Amnesia AMFP's case, you are doing very little puzzles and mainly just walking around as things happen, there is really no point in searching for any items, because there are NONE to gather! You are directed to every single object required to finish a puzzle and you don't do much aside from walking around, turn on a valve or two or pull some levers, then walk some more, often the narrative takes control from you, for the sake of telling you the story.\n\nCons:\n- Lack of inventory, there are no items to combine for a puzzle or things to conserve.\n- Lack of sanity meter, you don't have to worry about anything.\n- Most of the environments were dull and you can't interact with it, 80-90% of the time like in Amnesia and Penumbra. They look good though, but thats about it.\n- The flashlight you find is endless, it requires no fuel or battery.\n- Exploring in it is kind of pointless since all you are looking for are notes, and if there are puzzles, you mostly find stuff immediately, there is nothing cleverly hidden.\n\n\nPros:\n- The Score is pretty good.\n- Most of the areas had nice-good atmosphere.\n- It had very good concepts for the most part.\n\nI would say more about the story and monster, but this remains spoiler free.\n\nOverall, I rate this game 5/10, it's not really a survival horror game, it's just a walking horror tale.","September 10, 2013","false","4.4"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","4"

The gameplay involves a lot fewer "typical" aspects (no health, sanity, or inventory) but still manages to not feel dumbed down.  The story is gripping and not only enhanced, but completed by the notes you find.

So to see for myself I bought it. I was pleasantly suprised. So to sum it up I'm gonna go over a few points. (WARNING: SPOILERS)\n\nContext: The game is set on the last days of December of the year 1899, with it finally turning to 1900 at the end of the game. You interact with a Victorian environment that's very steampunk-y in it's design. Expect cogs, pistons, sliding factory doors, conveyor belts and industrial blast furnaces. Throughout the story you will encounter early telephone devices on the walls and recieve calls from a strange and omnipresent voice belonging to a character known only as 'The Engineer'.\nAmnesia differs from the first game by introducing an outside element to the game, especially towards the end where you must run through the streets of Victorian London whilst the mass murder of it's populace occurs around you.\n\nAesthetics: For me this was a beautiful game. The artwork was fantastic. This may have been because I'm a sucker for the steampunk genre but ho-hum. I enjoyed every single bit of this game and genuinely appreciated the time and effort gone into making this stunning environment. The visual appeal ranges from the ornate and flamboyant house that is Oswald Mandus's stately mansion to the grimy, grim and grotesque lab areas, slaughtering floors and the rightly feared animal holding pens.\n\nPlay-style: Like it's older counter-part the Dark Descent; Amnesia: AMFP is a first-person survival horror in a steampunk-y, spooky environment full of beasts that crawl throug the sewage pipes, ventilation shafts and walkways of varying factory levels, storage warehouses and even a church at one point! The decision to remove the inventory was a brash and somewhat unexpected and occasionally unwanted move. But as contreversial as it was it did help the game flow and also removed the average Dark Descent player's favourite hiding spot! There is also an infinite lantern an the removal of Daniel's nyctophobic anxiety disorder; AKA: the fear of the darkness. These combined made it so that there was no need for a finite lantern fuel system. Many players would be very happy to run around in the darkness as there would be no pyschological consequences, unlike the Dark Descent where the other threat was passing out due to lost sanity from being in the dark too long.\nInstead the lantern now acts as a rough early-warning system in relation to the monsters proximity to the player. Watch for the flickering lantern!\n\nSo in conclusion I think that the game deserves a solid 7/8-10. It's beautiful environment and chilling storyline following the plot of Oswald Madus slowly losing his mind in anger towards the harsh and unforgiving capitalist society only intersted in personal-gain and greed. I really enjoyed walking/running/hiding through the levels and thought that they really added towards a creepy atmosphere within the game. The music whilst beautiful is also deeply unerving and goes towards the horrific feeling of being within the bowels of this immense machine. It's only shortcoming is it's lack of really, genuinely terrifying points becuase of tension. Don't get me wrong there's tension but not the spine-chilling, brain-bursting tension that would make Chuck Norris weep in his seat. Despite this; overall, definately worth a look! Especially if you like steampunk. If you need further convincing look at some of the playthroughs on Youtube, there are plenty of intersting videos to watch! Enjoy and have fun!\n\nRegards ~ MetalMethod357\n\nP.S. I'd love some feedback on this. I'm thinking of writing reviews for a lot of games, so tell me what you think.","January 2, 2014","true","25.5"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/pelvo_del_fuego/recommended/239200/","pelvo_del_fuego","KLED","http://steamcommunity.com/id/pelvo_del_fuego/","1018 products in account","Put simply, this game consists of encountering some kind of roadblock, finding the usually laughably easy solution to a "puzzle" and then watching as every important door relocks itself behind you. There's also machinery and pigs, all wrapped up in a very dark package. If you were to ask me in person what I think of A Machine For Pigs I'd reply with a shrug and a low non-committal noise, then suggest you just play it.\n\nYou know in The Dark Descent how you could pick up all of the random clutter scattered around the place and throw it around or break it? It was a great way to destress yourself after a scary part. A Machine For Pigs doesn't let you do that, the vast majority of the crap strewn around is just for decoration now and can't be interacted with. You also can't throw important items, so if, for example, you had to stick a lever into a hole in the wall, you couldn't chuck it from across the room and feel like a badass. Luckily (or not I guess) you won't need destressing. We'll get to that later though.\n\nSpeaking of not picking things up, you no longer have an inventory so you won't be scouring every nook and cranny for tinderboxes or oil. Almost everything's electric now, including your lantern, so there's no danger of running out of light. Not that that would be a problem anyway, but I'll get to that in a sec. On one hand, this is good news because it means you can keep advancing and following the story, but on the other hand not worrying about your oil removes a lot of tension. Remember when you were new to The Dark Descent and you didn't know all of the cheap ways to gain oil and avoid enemies? Those were the days. The lights suffer from the same issues as lights in every other horror game, so you know that if they start flickering it's brown trousers time.\n\nBack to running out of light not being a problem - this is because they've removed the sanity mechanic. In The Dark Descent if you sat in the dark or looked at a monster for too long you'd start losing your mind. This ultimately made it easier for enemies to get you. In A Machine For Pigs, however, you can just sit there with your light off and stare at the enemies until they get out of your way, just like in every other stealth game. The first time I encountered an actual enemy (as in an enemy that can attack you, not just scamper past and disappear around a corner) was in a massive dark room. I heard a horrid noise and was looking around, trying to find out what had made it, when suddenly a pig-monster thing ran at me and spanked me a few times. I ♥♥♥♥ you not, I "escaped" by turning off my lantern and crouching on the spot. I didn't expect that to work and had already resigned myself to having to restart when the monster strolled off. This brought back painful memories of Call of Cthulhu.\n\nLet's talk about scares. A Machine For Pigs takes the "make a loud noise and shake everything"\n\nroute. Now I'm not a game designer or horror writer or anything, I just play games, but this just feels more annoying than scary. The worst part is that whenever this happens the game stops you from moving, so you know there's absolutely no danger because you don't have the option to run and hide. When there is danger, on the other hand, the game makes sure to point you at the enemy during this temporary paralysis, so you know exactly where NOT to go. Thanks game. I don't know, maybe horror games just aren't for me any more.\n\nA Machine For Pigs was meant to be released in time for Halloween 2012, but was delayed until early September 2013. They said that the delay was because they weren't happy with the game and wanted to improve it. What we got was a watered down and honestly kind of dumb game that was over in about 4 hours, so I shudder to think what they had before the delay.\n\nThis whole thing felt a bit unfair. I really should have been focusing on what the game DID, not what it didn't do. It's just that everything was done so well in the past. If you want my real opinion, The Dark Descent is better than A Machine For Pigs, and the Penumbra series is better than either Amnesia game. As for the recommendation, do NOT buy this for $20. If you've not got The Dark Descent yet, spend your $20 on that instead, or better yet head over to the Frictional Games store and grab the Penumbra series for $10. It pains me to say it but this was just a huge disappointment.","September 11, 2013","false","6.1"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","7","13","0","0"

Having played quite a few horror games before, including even "Amnesia: The Dark Descent", i thought i knew what to expect. This game, however, showed me this thrilling feeling in a new light, something that i don't recall having experienced before so intensely: the excruciating build-up of tension, the prolonged moments of waiting for your "first encounter", whose signs are scattered all around you and become increasingly common. You know you've been waiting for this moment from the beginning of the game, yet it constantly torments you not through immediate fulfillment, but through a psychologically exhausting postponement of the act, like a sick version of a prelude that drags on and on, until you almost beg for it to happen, certain that whatever horrors are eventually revealed can not match in mental fatigue the torture that you've been put through while waiting for it, while stumbling in uncertainty and confusion, never knowing what you will face beyond the next door in your path.\n\nAnd, not to worry - or should i rather say, do worry! - when the awaited moment actually happens, when "your soul shudders at what you have just seen", this feeling is far from over; if anything, it makes you even more aware and uneasy about the slumbering horrors burdening your journey into the dark and de-humanizing industrial complex.","January 4, 2014","true","8.2"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","7","13","0","0"

To my dismay, after completing the game in less than 2 hours (compared to more than 10 for TDD) I was left feeling completely unsatisfied.  I did not speed through the game by any means and in fact, only really got slowed down by the common obtuse puzzle.  The game left me incredibly unsatisfied and here is why.\n\nThroughout the entire game, ignoring the last half hour or so, you encounter the monster probably twice.  Both times, the encounters lasted less than a minute or two as I just wait for the monster to walk past and exit through a door or just sneak past while he patrolled the area.  This aspect almost completely killed the atmosphere after the first 45 minutes or so when I realized that the monster is never a threat.  During the last half hour of the game when it bizarrely turns into a Michael bay sequence of explosions and pigs running everywhere doing little dances, I basically ran through it all because they were never a serious threat.  There is also no sanity meter and no pickups in the game whatsoever including fuel for your lantern which makes it less important than it was in previous games to scour your environment to find necessary items.  Having the items absent on their own isn't necessarily a bad thing but there is nothing else other than the notes to encourage exploration except when desperately searching to find "missing item #x" to progress past the latest puzzle.\n\nAlong the lines of not encouraging exploration is the level design itself.  Much of the game is claustrophobically linear to a fault and feels very forced at times with locked doors absolutely everywhere in the game.  This felt like it was designed in a way to keep the story's pacing from coming to a screeching halt for too long or to keep the puzzles from becoming even more complex.\n\nThis game is also developed solely by The Chinese Room (unknown to myself until after, I had thought they were simply working with Frictional Games) who are best known for making Dear Esther.  The story for MfP is absolutely impenetrable for many if you don't get the symbolism involved and you don't read the notes scattered around the map (because of the aforementioned lack of items).  When I made it to the end of the game, many things began to make sense but a lot of the circumstances leading up to the game's introduction made very little sense to me.\n\nThe other issue I have, while a small gripe, is with the graphics of the game.  They look uglier than TDD mainly due to the dark brown camera filter that is placed over 80% of the game as opposed to simply being in the environments' color palate.  While TDD's color palate was more of a bluish hue which ironically promoted a sense of calm in the player when in shadows (blue being a calming color and most visibly present when your "eyes" adjust to the darkness in-game).\n\nWith those negatives in mind, I must say that despite the lack of a real threat in the game, the game's atmosphere and soundtrack are incredibly tense and deserve mention as the game could almost be carried entirely by the atmosphere imo.  If there was one thing that kept me pinned down behind some boxes with my eyes wide and unblinkingly searching the room for potential threats, it was the atmosphere.\n\nThe voice acting is also very emotional and I was quite moved by many story sections leading up to the game's conclusion.  I wasn't bawling over it but it left me in a very sorrowful mood though in a good way.  By the end of the game, except for my lack of understanding the story behind it all, I genuinely cared about the protagonist's goal and once again the soundtrack helps emphasize these moments beautifully.  While I didn't understand the finer points and symbolism hidden within the game's story, I got enough of an idea to find it interesting, though the dominant symbolic idea (pigs) quickly grew repetitive by the end of the game's very short runtime.\n\nWith all this in mind, I do not recommend this game to anyone but those who liked Dear Esther AND aren't too picky with their horror experience.  The Chinese Room very obviously wanted to make another game like their previous game but also wanted to make it seem like an Amnesia game what with a monster to chase you and physics puzzles to solve.  Stripping out much of what made the previous game and other Penumbra so unique and even making the monster a rare occurrence took out much of the soul of this game.  I know there is much deeper meaning within this game than I could really understand but it should not be the only part about this game.  If they had just added more encounters with the monster in this game that were actually dangerous, while still keeping everything else the same, this game would have been incredible if not damn-near perfect.  As it is, this feels more like "Dear Piggies" than an Amnesia game or really a horror game of any kind.

The kicker, though? You were to confront the owner of the castle, an alien disguised as a human noble, from another dimension which defies all imagination.\n\nThe dimensional guest we are to confront has a motivation for his perseverence in all things. He wants to traverse the dimensions, back to his beloved. After centuries of studying cultures, creatures and the very human nature.\n\nThis would be a short and unimpressive description of the a fascinating plot which the first game has. Do the fans even care about these things? No, no one cares about the plot reasoning. They just want jumpscares so they can record their own stupidity on youtube.\n\nWhat A Machine for Pigs did, it cut out the cheap jumpscares and introduced a hard-to-digest storyline and a character which most fans can't comprehend or relate to in any way possible. The reaction? Not enough jumpscares.\n\nBottom line, the PewdiePie generation has the last word in any horror game which actively tries to be more than a jumpscare-dispenser.","November 22, 2014","true","5.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I think thechineseroom was a bad choice to develop a survival horror game. They do level design well but as indicated by their seminal work, Dear Esther, and this, they're pretty bad at telling a story without letting the surrealism of the story cloud the narrative. And they're terrible at symbolism. Very unsubtle.\n\nThat said, it's a competent little game, even if the horror has been declawed somewhat with the removal of any real penalty for "death".

This game presented me with an intriguing, thought-provoking, entertaining and most disturbed tale that really had my mind racing all throughout and even after, as well as my heart for much of the second two thirds of the game. The gameplay is rather simple, in a good way; unlike the first game, you can't manipulate most of the objects in the game and there are no mechanics pertaining to the player (i.e. inventory, sanity, etc) except for health. Most of the game involves solving moderately challenging puzzles (not so easy as to be boring, and not so hard as to require the aid of the internet), with a few action scenes wherein the player must flee monsters or escape pipes filling with hot steam. The level design is relatively realistic and rather expansive in multiple cases, and the graphical design of the game is rather excellent. The actual graphics are somewhat average -- this was not a game intending to boast its graphics, but some of its textures are noticably low quality, and the same goes for some unimportant static meshes. These things aren't too prevalent however, and shouldn't bother most people (I just happen to be the kind of person that examines the textures, models and graphical FX closely in games whenever given the chance).\n\nOverall, excellent game. Simple, but entertaining, scary when it intends to be and involving an excellent, deep, thought-provoking and twisted plot.","December 3, 2014","true","19.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

With all the Youtube press it recieved and barrage of indie horror games mimicking that followed. It's hard to deny it was an influential, innovative, and fantastic game. This game was a huge letdown in contrast. It's not all this game's fault however, the original Amnesia came out of nowhere as a suprise and thus I had no expectations from it other than was most likely going to be frightening to say the least. So it's hard to achieve something bigger than what the original had. That being said, I was still excited from the coverage I had been following online concerning this game so I was nonetheless pumped about it. It was a day one purchase for me out of pure faith. The opening seemed interesting to say the least but as soon as that was over and the gameplay segment had begun it didn't take long for me to notice changes in the series... changes for the worse.\n\nFirst off I almost immediately noticed you could not interact with most of the furniture and objects laying around the rooms. In the first Amenesia you could mess with almost anything whether it was form or function related, it was still fun to toss vases at the monsters as you were trying to make a break for it. In this sequel you can open very few drawers and cabinets, and the only other objects in rooms you can move are the chairs. I know thats a nitpick but it gets worse.\n\nAfter accepting that slight change I was trying to figure out how to open the inventory. I tried looking at the controls in the game and found nothing. I then read forums that said the inventory was removed. This simplified the game too much for my taste and seemed like it only made the game more bland.\n\nWith no inventory to open I then wondered how I would check my health and sanity... then I read more up on the game. There was no sanity meter... I mean what the ♥♥♥♥ man that was half of the fun of the original. Hiding in a corner wondering if you were going to either go ♥♥♥♥ing insane from the darkness or have to turn on your lamp to relieve yourself only to have a god damned monster with googly eyes staring you down. Pick your ♥♥♥♥ing poison! It was awesome. But no, no sanity meter here more watering down of what made the predecessor so great. Oh and that's another thing... your lamp, or old timey flashlight device, has an infinte source of light. There is no oil to fill it up with or anything you have to replenish it with at all in the game. On top of that your flashlight torch lamp thingy magiggy flickers on and off when a monster is near or about to appear taking away yet more tense build up moments. Also no god damned tinderboxes. I guess it doesn't matter anyway since half of the game's envirenment is lit and you don't have a sanity meter anyway. What a crock of ♥♥♥♥.\n\nThe story is even more far fetched and bizarre this time around, but it's ok I had no issues with it. The monsters are pigs instead of jawless, leather bondaged, flabby ♥♥♥ white things. They act the same though so again that change is purely aesthetic. On the plus side though is awesome atmosphere of late 1800's industrial London, you get to venture through a mansion, factories, a church and catacombs, slaughterhouses, sewers, even the streets of London itself. The music was also pretty intriguing. And the graphics were obviously better being it came out nearly 3 years after the first game.\n\nOverall this game is not bad by any means. It's fun and worth playing. The problem with it is that its just a watered down version of the first game with a different setting and characters. It brings nothing new to the table gameplay wise, it only takes things away. It's worth buying on Steam if you get it during a sale I'd say, otherwise I would invest my money in another title.","June 17, 2014","false","11.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Accordingly to this, you don't have an inventory anymore, and the icons of the phisical health and mental health are disappeared, and this is one of the worst points of this sequel i must say. The riddles aren't hard to solve like the ones in Dark Descent, and with the fact that you don't have an inventory, you can't bring items with you, and many times you only have to push levers or turn valves. But speaking about the positive aspects, A Machine for Pigs keeps the suspance with a very good plot and awesome musics; the monsters are well designed and the sounds that the pigs make are pretty scary. The ending was unexpected, and I was much surprised by all the philosophical concepts which are inserted into the game, expecially in the final part.\nIn the end, it's a good game, not good like Dark Descent, but it has its good points. Try it out, it deserves to be played ;)","April 20, 2014","true","6.6"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

It's too busy pushing its poorly crafted story down your throat and washing it down with heavy handed vulgar marxist rhetoric. If there was more game and less awful, high handed dialogue then it might have stood a chance but frankly it seems to be too concerned with being the intellectual saviour of video games to realise that in order to do that it needs to embrace the qualities of the artfrom (i.e. the GAME part) rather than simply try to make a vaguely interactive film.

Many of the game mechanics from The Dark Descent are gone, no inventory, sanity, or latern oil remain. There is very little survival or horror in this sequal to one of my favorite survival horror video games. If you expect this to be like the original then you will most likely be disappointed.\n\nAll of that being said, the game does look good - in an artistic way, this isn't CryEngine. The music fits the atmosphere very well, and the story isn't too bad either. If you pick this game up on sale, or you don't enter the game with too many expectations, then you will most likely enjoy it. It's not bad, but in my opinion Frictional Games messed up by having the Chinese Room develop this. I wish I could give a more neutral recommendation, but given the binary option Steam gives me I will have to say No, I will not recommend this game. This is mostly because I was personally disappointed, but you may not be - so don't let that stop you from playing.\n\nI hope that there's another Amnesia game in the future, but I hope that next time Frictional Games goes back to how they made The Dark Descent.","December 23, 2013","false","5.9"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/addier/recommended/239200/","addier","Addier","http://steamcommunity.com/id/addier/","29 products in account","The Bad:\nWhile the game does manage to tell an interesting story, I feel it lacks most if not all of the things that made the first Amnesia game such an icon in the horror genre. Similarly to the Dark Descent, the narrator / flashbacks or what have you speak in cryptic, enthralling tongues and, coupled with an amazing soundtrack, create an atmosphere that is at the very least enjoyable and enveloping. Despite this, the game does not replicate the experience that the first Amnesia game provided. The puzzles (if you want to call them that) are incredibly easy to solve and are very linear, leaving almost no room to miss something and be stuck pondering what you must do next to continue onwards. Rather than having to traverse back and forth through multiple zones and pay close attention to journal entries in order to solve puzzles, all you have to do is pretty much find valves, spin them, and you win. In addition, the game no longer features sanity, and your light source (lantern) does not have batteries / oil or anything so you have no reason to be afraid of the dark. Next, without spoiling any of the story, I will say that the game takes the whole "Pig" thing a little too far. You'll see what I mean when you play the game yourself. As as far as the scares themselves go, I can't say there was more than a few decent scares in the game. Whereas my heart was pounding in fear every time I opened a door in Amnesia: The Dark Descent, this game rarely raised my pulse, and if it did, it wasn't a drastic increase. I don't know if I was just used to the Amnesia style of scares at this point or if the game was really just dull in the fright department, but I'm going to go with the ladder. Let's not forget how incredibly short the game is. On my first playthrough with no knowledge of the game, I managed to complete the game in about three hours, having died only twice. Finally, the narrative of the game is a bit predictable. About halfway through the game (or maybe even sooner than that), you know full well what is going to happen and if you have some brain power you can most likely also deduce something else quite early on, but I can't say what that is for obvious reasons.\n\nThe Good:\nThe game, provided you play with all settings maxed out, looks incredible. Though the atmosphere provided may not have been the most horrific thing ever, it definitely shows that Frictional Games knows how to create an atmoshpere. And that's good. Also, the game has an amazing soundtrack and features a strong narrative that would definitely be suitable for a book. All in all, the game is certainly enjoyable, and being that it does not cost as much as most games out there, I would definitely recommend at least one playthrough, though don't expect to be blown away.\n\nI didn't notice any options for custom stories, either, so if the game is lacking that feature, it will most certainly have a negative impact on my opinion of the game. I hope this review was helpful.","January 8, 2014","true","7.1"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

The storyline is difficult to understand and relies heavily on notes/journals, which are archaically written (for the time period, granted) and in an extremely odd font that makes it even more of a challenge to try and decipher. The game was over in less than half the time of the first game, and provided no clear reasoning for its ending. Perhaps I wasn't as engaged as I should have been, but I was confused throughout the entire story.\nA not-creepy-but-very-annoying blue fog is in nearly every level, making it impossible to see things and putting a weird bloom effect on everything. Other players suggested removing the file for the fog, which I never did, arguing that a game worth my time wouldn't drive players to change files to make the game bearable.\nThe "monsters" are not psychologically damaging in any way to the senses, as they were in Amnesia - The Dark Descent. There is no chase music, and the creatures simply aren't scary.\nThis review is in no way a reflection on the abilities of thechineseroom, rather the situation that thechineseroom was put in. To my understanding, thechineseroom makes art games and indie stories, such as Dear Esther (which was beautiful and wonderfully written), and do not have the mindset to make horror stories. Frictional Games let me down a bit with this, especially considering how long I had been waiting for the game and how long it had been postponed for (even more than BioShock Infinite).","December 16, 2013","false","8.3"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"

Overusage of large and unusual words made the notes complicated and irrelevant, and the endless monologues really p*ssed me off. By the time actual monsters showed up, I was so annoyed at the game wallowing in its own brilliancy that it was no longer scary, but more annoying.\n\nThe graphics are nice, but the game has a strange blue filter over everything, that makes practically everything hard to see, lantern or not.\n\nIf you are a horror fan looking for something new, it's worth a look.

Instead of having an encounter with an enemy, you instead are given numerous glimpses of the monster. While this is scary the first few times, it becomes very annoying and you never feel as if you are ever in danger. While the monsters in the first game were terrifying, the Manpigs in the sequel look very generic and not scary at all. The game is very linear and has very few puzzles.

Everything looked disgustingly gorgeous as well throughout the campaign and except a few textures that i personally would wantt a bit sharper up close when playing the looks of this game is great, so along with the sound work. Not only were the sound effects great but how the sound was used around you I do approve of, and in dark areas you rely as much on your hearing as your vision.\n\nCONS:\nHowever I do want to leave some cons in here, if you've played through the first Amnesia, this one feels a bit lacking when it comes to encounters of patrolling npcs in dark areas, there could've been more situations of this in my eyes since this is probably what most people remember the other game for. Though the story is just as solid if not better excecuted in Machine for pigs, you do feel like there could've been just more gameplay avoiding and sneaking past npcs and everything feels a bit too straight forward at times which might actually make it a bit shorter than it could've been, and the game lands in on about 3 and a half hours worth of playthrough, which I'd personally consider a bit too short to leave a greater mark.\n\nAnother thing to note that doesn't have to always be bad but does change the mechanics of the game, is that the inventory system is completely missing in this game. This leaves out things like looking for items to carry and craft, to find and fill on your oil in the lantern etc. This was a what I'd consider an important aspect of the game to make it what it was, and without it, it just feels thin.\n\nCONCLUSION:\nThe game is a great game by any means, and it remains on top of the line when it comes to horror/adventure games worth playing out there, but if it comes to the question "Is it better than Amnesia: Dark Descent?" My answer is,  No, it probably isn't. But if you enjoyed any of their other games I'd suggest getting this in no time since the pricetag is not too bad, and Linux support is great as well(Yes mac is for it too but who'd want to play on such crap anyway).\n\nGreat game, get it if you like Amnesia or Penumbra. Just be aware that it might be over before you know it.","September 14, 2013","true","3.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

A Machine for Pigs burrows its way into Victorian fear of its own industrious brave new world, the hallmarks of futurism, and existential musings on the nature of man and evil. All of this wrapped in grimy, visceral prose, much akin to the machinery the player stalks the bowels of.\n\nBut it feels TCR overstepped their creative boundaries into what drew people in Frictional's previous titles Penumbra and The Dark Descent completely. Gone are the inventories, the limited resources, the ever-growing insanity. Your light never fails, you never need to drag an object more than twenty feet, and death is only a temporary setback. It feels almost as if Frictional had very little to do with it, aside from the Amnesia brand name and some input on nasty monstrosities out to eat the player (And these moments are very few). You will spend a lot of time walking around and listening to talking. Doesn't that seem familiar, now? Dear Esther was an experiment, one I feel failed, but dragged kicking and screaming into this long awaited project. I think Frictional were tossed to the side as nothing more than code monkeys, with the rest of the design process dominated by The Chinese Room. Do not seek a survival horror, here: Whatever plans for it have been buried by script dictation.\n\nIt's not all bad, though. If you do want the thick atmosphere of rusted, Victorian machinery, the trudging through the catabolism of our species as the anabolism of it stalks you, and finding out just what those colourful piggie masks are all about, I suppose you could do a little worse than spending the tenner to find out just what exactly lies deep beneath that meat packing plant. But if TCR want to create Dear Esther, then try to inject that piece of ♥♥♥♥ into Amnesia, then I'm going to hold it to the same criticisms: What is it, in the medium of videogames, that I could not have experienced or entertained from a good book, or an elaborate theme park ghost house? If you want to challenge the medium of videogames, you're going to have to do better than this. Take responsibility for your crusade, don't drag another's projects down with you into pretense hell.","September 11, 2013","true","4.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I'm sure the story is good and all, but I can't get into the story because the game is so boring. The monster isn't scary looking, mostly just boring jump scares like  you see the monster run past a doorway you're about to walk through like 8 times before you actually encounter it, when you encounter it, you can pretty much escape it by walking. If you loved running and grabbing random stuff and throwing it at the monster chasing you like in the first game. You can't do that in this one. Almost all of the objects are locked in place. The puzzles are extremly easy(maybe they get harder but I got too bored and disapointed to continue playing) I tried getting into the story, and tried coming back to the game a few times but i couldn't get into it. The disapointment was too much. I know the blame isn't all on the chinese room, but I think the game would have been much better if they didn't get involved. I don't see why they replaced fun and scary gameplay with a good story instead of just having both.","October 20, 2014","false","4.0"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"

The kicker, though? You were to confront the owner of the castle, an alien disguised as a human noble, from another dimension which defies all imagination.\n\nThe dimensional guest we are to confront has a motivation for his perseverence in all things. He wants to traverse the dimensions, back to his beloved. After centuries of studying cultures, creatures and the very human nature.\n\nThis would be a short and unimpressive description of the a fascinating plot which the first game has.

They just want jumpscares so they can record their own stupidity on youtube.\n\nWhat A Machine for Pigs did, it cut out the cheap jumpscares and introduced a hard-to-digest storyline and a character which most fans can't comprehend or relate to in any way possible.

Not enough jumpscares.\n\nBottom line, the PewdiePie generation has the last word in any horror game which actively tries to be more than a jumpscare-dispenser.","November 22, 2014","true","5.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

To it's credit, even in this short time span I went through an impressive range of emotions.  First, I was unsettled and creeped out, waking up in a bed that was surrounded by an animal cage.  Next I was curious to learn who I was and what events had led to my precarious situation.  As I picked up and read some scattered notes I felt genuinely disturbed as they described surgical experiments and mutilation.  Roaming a labyrinthian sewer, I lost my way and confusion set in.  Then somewhere along the way I got tired of looking at bricks and pipes and I got bored.\n\nThe setting of A Machine for Pigs is intriguing; taking place in London (I believe...) around the start of the industrial revolution it's the Lovecraft tropes we know and love, but in a setting that's somewhat unique for the genre.  The character you control is the owner of a meat packing business, and the advent of automated machinery to replace human workers leaves him a little obsessed with streamlining the production line.  Under his house lies impossibly complex machines of death to slaughter the livestock.  And of course by “pigs” he means humans.  His kids take to playing in these death tunnels and have an accident around the pig people.  Discovering his twin boys' demise leads your protagonist further into madness, and he becomes obsessed with bringing them back.  The underground laboratories help his quest as he feeds more blood into his machines with the promise of quenching the insatiable appetite of an elder god residing in an abyssian pyramid.  His wife died, too?  Forgive me if the details are hazy, but this is one of those “pick up the notes” types of storytelling, and it also really doesn't matter that much because it's more about the atmosphere of the game.\n\nAnd the spooky atmosphere is done rather well.  At first, anyway.  The early portions of A Machine for Pigs could reasonably be criticized for being nothing more than “boo, haunted house” jump scares, but these are quite effective and the strongest parts of the game.  Descending deeper into the earth you'd figure a darker madness awaited you, but no... it's mostly just recycled bricks and pipes and steam.  There's a real good buildup to revealing the pig-men hybrid monsters that stalk the halls, and seeing one for the first time is unnerving.  Unfortunately that's about all you're going to see in terms of monsters, and their effectiveness wears off long before the apocalyptic payoff of pigmen running rampant in the streets of London.  They become more nuisance than nightmare, obstacles between you and the solution to a simplistic puzzle you'd otherwise solve before you knew the problem.  Again, for a short game it seems like it's stretching itself too thin.\n\nI started off fairly high on Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs, but as I progressed I grew less interested.  It's been awhile since I played the original Amnesia, but somehow I remember much more about that game than the one I just finished.  It's almost like... no, ♥♥♥♥ it.","October 20, 2015","false","4.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

While it's a beautiful wretched game, it isn't up to par compared to the other two.\n\nI won't spoil too much (though honestly the plot is even more bare bones than its predecessor) but there's a lot to take in and explore, but again, greatly simplified. There's no inventory, enemies can persue you though not very far and aren't as numerous, puzzles are rather obvious, and exploration is at a minimum.\n\nThat doesn't keep A Machine for Pigs from getting a recommendation though, while it's more limited, there's vast amounts you can leave to your twisted imagination and the scale is quite epic. The biggest thing it ends up doing wrong is making itself an Amnesia game considering its predecesors are superior in many ways. It's more of a standalone than a sequel, an episode rather than a complex game. But again, hardly a terrible thing.

Why? Well, because there's so many jumpscare horror games out there nowadays. Jump scare horror games while, yes, do scare you, are very easy to make and take minimal effort. The Chinese Room could've very easily done just this and given us a half-effort game full of cheap jumpscares. But they didn't, instead they decided to take time and make a game that will do more than give you a heart-attack, it will, instead send chills down your spine and leave you feeling disturbed long after you've finished it.\nThe atmosphere is spot on, the ambiance is great, the story is chilling and the main character is interesting and extremely complex. I won't give away details about the storyline but, if you're concerned about this game not being connected to TDD at all, it is, don't worry, you just gotta be quick enough to notice it ;). So, overall,  AAMFP is a fresh take on the Amnesia franchise and is one those games, where you honestly have to play for yourself to really develop a good opinion on it. Honestly, it's no TDD but, it's still a great game and worth a play. 7/10","December 4, 2014","true","5.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Representing a factory as essentially a slaughterhouse for the detritus is nothing short of genius, and the emotional ramifications of the player's identity within this setting particulary puts me at unease.\n\nHowever, fans of The Dark Descent will certainly notice the huge step back in terms of challenge and gameplay mechanics with A Machine for Pigs. If you solely wish to engage in a terrifically written interactive experience, this might not be an issue at all, but gamers looking for challenge will find disappointment.\n\nIf I have any real issue, it's that there doesn't seem to be enough here for A Macine for Pigs to exist as a sequel of a monetary value equal to its predecessor. Many mechanics and concepts from Dark Descent are discarded with basically nothing to fill that void (Although personally I'm glad they did away with the Insanity mechanic). This does mean the puzzles don't outstay their welcome like they begun to in Dark Descent, but it's still ultimately a full fledged sequel with half the content.\n\nBut on the other hand, I still try to judge A Machine for Pigs (and basically all pieces of entertainment), not by its cost nor its quantity, but its quality. And A Machine for Pigs was a very satisfying nightmare to endure. It's short, but makes every single moment count for something substantial, and has a story and setting that is considerably more engrossing than Dark Descent's. The ending is also superior.\n\nIf exploring a living, mechanical embodiment of humanity's capacity for efficient, apathetic evil is your jam, I can't think of a better way to spend 4-5 hours. Well, obviously there are several. But you should also look into this game. When it's cheap.","September 19, 2015","true","12.4"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

To it's credit, even in this short time span I went through an impressive range of emotions.  First, I was unsettled and creeped out, waking up in a bed that was surrounded by an animal cage.  Next I was curious to learn who I was and what events had led to my precarious situation.  As I picked up and read some scattered notes I felt genuinely disturbed as they described surgical experiments and mutilation.  Roaming a labyrinthian sewer, I lost my way and confusion set in.  Then somewhere along the way I got tired of looking at bricks and pipes and I got bored.\n\nThe setting of A Machine for Pigs is intriguing; taking place in London (I believe...) around the start of the industrial revolution it's the Lovecraft tropes we know and love, but in a setting that's somewhat unique for the genre.  The character you control is the owner of a meat packing business, and the advent of automated machinery to replace human workers leaves him a little obsessed with streamlining the production line.  Under his house lies impossibly complex machines of death to slaughter the livestock.  And of course by “pigs” he means humans.  His kids take to playing in these death tunnels and have an accident around the pig people.  Discovering his twin boys' demise leads your protagonist further into madness, and he becomes obsessed with bringing them back.  The underground laboratories help his quest as he feeds more blood into his machines with the promise of quenching the insatiable appetite of an elder god residing in an abyssian pyramid.  His wife died, too?  Forgive me if the details are hazy, but this is one of those “pick up the notes” types of storytelling, and it also really doesn't matter that much because it's more about the atmosphere of the game.\n\nAnd the spooky atmosphere is done rather well.  At first, anyway.  The early portions of A Machine for Pigs could reasonably be criticized for being nothing more than “boo, haunted house” jump scares, but these are quite effective and the strongest parts of the game.  Descending deeper into the earth you'd figure a darker madness awaited you, but no... it's mostly just recycled bricks and pipes and steam.  There's a real good buildup to revealing the pig-men hybrid monsters that stalk the halls, and seeing one for the first time is unnerving.  Unfortunately that's about all you're going to see in terms of monsters, and their effectiveness wears off long before the apocalyptic payoff of pigmen running rampant in the streets of London.  They become more nuisance than nightmare, obstacles between you and the solution to a simplistic puzzle you'd otherwise solve before you knew the problem.  Again, for a short game it seems like it's stretching itself too thin.\n\nI started off fairly high on Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs, but as I progressed I grew less interested.  It's been awhile since I played the original Amnesia, but somehow I remember much more about that game than the one I just finished.  It's almost like... no, ♥♥♥♥ it.","October 20, 2015","false","4.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

It's also an interesting gamble that they hired The Chinese Room to make a Sequel considering that they have never done a horror game.\n\nWhether it payed off or not is up to the player to decide i personally like Amnesia Machine For Pigs but i understand that it might not appeal to everyone. Unfortunately it's a walking simulator and the focus on sneak gameplay and horror encounters has been strip down to a bare minimum. So the only thing that is there is a level design about clicking a few switches and a audio narrative story about a tale of love, death and pigs. Thankfully The Chinese Room now's how to Tell a story since they have done that in the past with Dear Esther and with Everyone goes to the Rapture (which would release on the ps4 a few year later).\n\n7.3/10 Verdict: Sadly it's Dear Esther with an amnesia skin so try to see it as different take than an actual Sequel and you might still enjoy it.","March 12","true","6.9"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

The game is a very streamlined version of Amnesia with all of the survival and most of the horror elements removed. However what remains is kinda very good but not reminicent of the previous game. You just kind of walk around and listen and read the well written story while listening to the excellent sound design and soundtrack. There are some enemies in the game, but they don't look very threatening and you can easily outrun them. The lack of threat and pressure is a major letdown, and while the sound design is impressive, it is at best only unnerving and not at all scary.\n\nIn true The Chinese Room fashion the game is also very artsy and pretentious and it is very lacking in its forms of engaging with the game world. That might annoy some people who just want to play something with more clearly presented story and substantial gameplay.\n\nI myself enjoyed most of the game, and I was kind of expecting something like this when I heard The Chinese Room is involved. You just need to tackle A Machine for Pigs with an open mind and not expect it to be like the original Amnesia, and maybe you'll find something to enjoy in this game.\n\nThe game gets a recommendation from me, but only barely.","September 12, 2013","true","4.2"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

Bringing in the writing power of TheChineseRoom (makers of Dear Esther) and delaying the game's release in order to better meet the expectations of the consumer base it was widely expected that aMfP would be a smash hit...\nIn reality, it's very disappointing.\nThe first of many flaws is the absolute removal of almost all the interactivity that made the first game so immersive, the player can no longer pick up/throw objects like in The Dark Descent, making the game feel so much more restrictive alongside it's extremely linear level design.\nSecondly, the challenge of the game is almost non-existant with the unnecessary removal of the Insanity mechanic, and the light has unlimited use, these two poor choices of gameplay make aMfP seem more like a cheap Slender ripoff than anything that can rightfully bear the title of an Amnesia game.\nFinally, the story is nearly the polar opposite of The Dark Descent, instead of being compelling and interesting the story for A Machine for Pigs is drab and uninteresting, completely failing to capture my interest and leaving no memorable moments (they resorted to using the "creepy little children" archetype, a telltale sign of desparation for a scare factor).\nSince I loved TheChineseRoom's previous game, Dear Esther, and I greatly respect their ability to convey story, I left A Machine for Pigs feeling all the more dissapointed. Frictional Games and TheChineseRoom let the Amnesia fanbase down, and should have payed more attention to what made The Dark Descent the king of the horror genre.\nSo no, I do not recommend A Machine for Pigs.","November 10, 2013","false","1.2"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Even forced myself to like it.\nBut me, and the friends who have played the counterpart, have both agreed they took a major part away from Amnesia, namely... The Inventory\n\nThe inventory is what defined most of Amnesia, if I'm fair, holding items crucial to the story, and player development. When they took this away, they cut a major part from the story, in my opinion. You are now bound to weird phones, and dragging things along for 3 levels. (Exaggerated)\n\nThis was a major downfall for me, because the predecessor had this so well done.\n\nOne of the good things I found, is that the monsters do not dissapear after you die, but instead keep patrolling. I have got to admit, I got frustrated, but none the less, a good feature.\n\nThen on to the enemies, who help you in the cages. They are extremely dumb, and can be easily avoided by a hit-'n-run tactic. Just gotta wait your time. This was also a huge letdown for me, as they remained oblivious to you, when you already reached the next room, and gave up chasing you, thus ending in really easy enemies.\n\nI could of forgiven SO much about it, though, if it wasn't for the biggest dissapointment of all.\nThe Story\n\nThe story makes absolute zero sense, about some guy going to the Nevada desert, or whatever else got sand, coming back, getting ill, and his children have vanished, and all of a sudden pigs roam the castle. I mean, COME... ON.... This is original, yet SO crummily put together.\n\nTwo hours into the game, and I set it down, and never finished it since.\n\nIT honestly pains me to give the second part of the game, such a bad review, but this leaves me nothing else but a sad, low 2.5 in my book.\n\nAs much as I'd like to say the contrary, it's not worth the buy, if you're in for a good experience.","September 28, 2013","false","1.2"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Its atmosphere, sound design and graphics overall are really well done and the story told by The Chinese Room here is quite interesting as well. For $20.00 USD you really could do a lot worse, and A Machine for Pigs is certainly great quality for its price. The short comings are the fact that it is part of a series and with that comes some basic expectations which are completely removed in this installment. You won’t be dealing with insanity, inventory, lamp oil, tinderboxes; basically you won’t worry about much in this game aside from the monsters. Your lantern never runs out of energy and puzzles are fairly easy because you can only interact with so much.  You can definitely tell they focused more on the story and background than on anything else since most of it is removed. The other minuscule annoyance comes from the frequency of notes in the game. There are a ton of them, the font used in-game is sometimes a pain to read (this comes down to the individual) and a large portion of the game seems to rely on these notes.  Overall, A Machine for Pigs is a decent horror game and a good first attempt by The Chinese Room, but as an Amnesia title it is definitely a step backwards and fans of the series will walk away wanting more. This is a bit tough since the game is of great quality for the price of admission but it comes as a tough full on recommendation for  fans, and newcomers would be better served to play the previous installments before playing A Machine for Pigs.\n\n-Middle of the Road from Royial\n\nVideo Reviews can be found at: www.youtube.com/user/RoyialNetwork","November 1, 2013","false","8.3"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

If you are looking for something like The Dark Descent, it isn't this. The atmosphere was ruined by the lack of inventory managment and sanity meter that you had to watch so closely in the first game. So it eased up on the pressure on the player. There was also no puzzles in this game. In the first you had to figure things out in order to proceed in the game, but without these obstacles it made the game far too linear. Now the jumpscares were fine for the first third of the game, but after you have your first real encounter with the monsters, they seem cheap and less scary then what was probably intended.\n\nI will say this for the game, there were two things I liked. Number one, the story. Most people that played Amnesia, played it for the scares. If you were one of the few that liked the story and gathering all the notes in the first one then yeah, this one is interesting. At first all the notes and diaries are out of order so it's all very confusing, but slowly over the course of the game you starting getting the larger scope of the picture. I personally found the plot interesting, but it was also very much like Doctor Who christmas special. By the credits you would think Moffat wrote this game.\n\nThe real thing I liked about this game was the soundtrack. That I happily bought off of amazon mp3 and felt I got my money's worth. The game itself....not so much.\n\nNot with all the hype they put up about it for over a year of worths of delays.  Also the lack of ability to do custom stories makes it not really worth the price that is regular. If you absolutely want to play this game, wait until it goes on steam sale and then get it. Don't pay full price.","February 16, 2014","false","8.0"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

It displayed a unique spin on madness, refreshing the usual plot of mass destruction found in such games. However the "big reveal" is quite obvious from pretty much the beginning and the mechanics of the game were a bit of a letdown. Where The Dark Descent added enough environmental interaction to make you unsure if what you were picking up was a part of the puzzle or just another box, A Machine For Pigs only allows for the movement of objects related to the puzzles, making it to be a tad predictable and linear.\n\nOtherwise I’d highly recommend playing if you want to sit back and enjoy the ride, especially if Steampunky science if your thing.\n","November 23, 2015","true","4.7"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Reason why it is bad are the following\n\n-Story drags on to long. It feels uninspired, which makes it boring.\nI think it's pseudo-metaphoric. The narration tries to sound very enigmatic, but fails in the process.\n\n-Gameplay is a total lackluster. This game is completely on rails. Most of the time you are wandering in a straight line. You never have any real choice were you want to go. Don't be fooled by many doors you see on screenshots. Basically you move in a big corridor.\n\n-the monsters are only scary at first, only to become annoying later down the line, as you progress through the game. This is a problem with many horror games, however Amnesia the Dark Descent conquered this issue by showing enemies less frequent, which also helped in making the game more atmospheric. A good horror game does not need to have monster all to the time, just to be scary.\n\n-I regret buying this game, it's a complete joke compared to the dark descent. If you think about it, it sort of makes sense, since it wasn't made by the same studio. It lacks atmosphere, gameplay and choice.

AMFP is ultra linear, puzzles have been almost entirely stripped from the formula and the interesting game mechanic of being unable to directly look at enemies has been removed. Gameplay survival elements such as healing items and oil for your lantern are also gone. The new enemies are almost comical in appearance and are rarely life threatening.\n\nWhat all this amounts to is a total lack of tension.

In the game you have no inventory system, infinite lamp juice, no scavaging, not so horrifying monsters, and pointless puzzles. It basically is a walking simulator where you just walk and walk and pull levers and spin valves and continue walking. The game is not that scary at all so all the jump scares n all are just not in the game. Only a few things I liked about this game was the mapping and the story. The story was so interesting and great that their main focus was on that than focusing on more gameplay. It's nice to explore the maps like in Dear Esther, but the gameplay is still lacking. There is no point calling it an Amneisa game if it doesnt have what TDD had. It's not about how great the story or mapping is it's about the feel of the game. The feel of being helpless and trying to survive the terror of the monsters who are hunting you down. There is no custom stories for this and even if their was it would still not make up for the lack of gameplay.\n\n6/10. Stay with Amneisa: TDD and people might port the ♥♥♥♥ from this game into the TDD custom stories.

While the theme and the story are great, they have hindered many of the original game's key features.\n1. You have no inventory. You no longer need to scavenge and explore to find tinderboxes, oil for your lantern (now electric), or any of the items you need to progress. This was one of the best parts of the first Amnesia. There was a sense of helplessness and vulnerability when you had to find all of the parts to make a potion or to fix a machine while your lamp was running out. This game is incredibly dumbed down.\n\n2. Notes aren't voice acted anymore. Not that big of a deal, I know, but I really enjoyed all the extra effort that was prevalent in the first one when Daniel would read the notes to you, which made him seem more alive.\n\n3. The game just isn't that scary. Probably the biggest dissapointment of all. The monsters in the trailer and teaser for the game made them look terrifying. In reality, all they are are pigs that freak out and walk quickly towards you, and they are easy to lose. And there aren't even that many! The creepy and eerie factor that the story brought you is there, minus the jump scares.\n\nI really hope that they make a third that will really quench my thirst for the horror series, but for now, I think I'll stick with the first one.","December 24, 2013","false","6.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Wow, was I wrong. I beat the game in under 2 hours the first time and then proceeded to play it two more times all the way through before uninstalling it. (I have 4 hours on record at this time). This game was simply too easy. They limited the things you could interact with to items that were significant to the puzzles or the back story. NOTHING ELSE! You couldn't even pick up a chair. To make things worse, out of the 5 or so encounters with the monsters, every single one of them was very easy to pass, seeing as they would only chase you in a certain (VERY small) area and couldn't even do things such as break down doors. Dying was also easily avoidable because it took the monsters up to 5 hits to kill you. If you still aren't convinced, they took away the oil lantern and replaced it with a lantern that NEVER runs out. Not only that, but you no longer have an insanity level, so run around in the dark and stare at the monsters to your hearts content. I wont go in depth with the story, but I will say that the ending was not worth the little amount of game time it takes to reach it. It leaves you with too many questions and includes a small twist that most people will see coming. As for getting this game yourself? NO! Never! Just buy the first one which is rich with replayability. Hope this helps!","March 22, 2014","false","5.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I was expecting the whole hog and all I got was scrawny pork chops. While I can't recommend-recommend the game, I wouldn't say don't play it. Just expect to feel a little empty inside afterwards, especially if you liked the first game.\n\nLong Review: I am a fan of the first Amnesia game. It had a fantastic setting, dark and gritty and wonderfully oppressive. And it had an interesting lead and while Daniel was a ♥♥♥♥♥♥, you could feel for the guy. You got to get inside of his head, got to feel his fear, experience his unknowing at what was going on. You and Daniel got to experience the game together (him with fresh eyes at the horrors he did, you; the player, progressing through the story). And it was a good game. A great game even: Simple enough of a story that it wasn't overly complex and yet engaging.\n\nThen came Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs. When I first started to follow the game's production, I was thrilled that they were making a sequel. I didn't know where they would take the game, since the endings to the first one left little wiggle room for a second, but I was eager all the same. Then I learned Fractional Games wasn't making it. I started to feel a little uneasy about the game then. But it would be alright, right? They wouldn't just hand off one of their titles off to someone that didn't know what they were doing, right?\n\nThen I heard the Chinese Room was making it. Now, when I learned this, I had just finished playing one of their other games "Dear Ester" (Just...biggest waste of money -ever-). Now I started to feel some real dread. I worried about what the game would hold, but I decided to try and keep an open mind.\n\nSo when it came out, and I played it, I liked it well enough as I was going through it: The environment was lovely and the little glimpses of the main's children were a nice creepy touch. But then the ending to the game came and I started to feel unsatisfied. And afterwards: Unhappy. The story was complex in the worst possible way. The character's internal narrative bogged down the story, making it difficult to follow in some places and in the end, I felt no sympathy towards him. I was glad he died, he deserved it, no matter how much the game wanted to put some sort of Jekyll and Hyde twist on him.\n\nI also missed the insanity meter, which meant I could stare at something disturbing until the cows came home and Oswald wouldn't get disturbed by it even a little. (Of course, an in game reason is that Oswald is -maybe- more mentally sound then Daniel-I'll-just-♥♥♥♥-my-pants-now, but even that doesn't make much sense since just being in the presence of the Orb broke him, While Daniel managed to at least retain his relative sanity until he was pushed to the point he feared for his life and was willing to do ANYTHING to save it)\n\nAnyway: The game was not good. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't good either and not a good follow up to Amnesia: The Dark Decent. It might have done a little better if it didn't carry the tag "Amnesia", perhaps my hopes wouldn't have been so high, but overall, I can't recommend the game on the merit of a bogged down story, unsympathetic and uninteresting characters, and unsatisfactory game play (It's "Dear Ester + Mild Horror elements" really). I will recommend the game though on its visuals and interesting setting though.","February 16, 2014","false","8.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The story was strange (not interesting), enemies were not a challenge to avoid nor particularly bothersome, and the heart-pumping element of danger that Dark Descent so well induced is completely absent.

After receiving some praise from critics, the Youtube crowd took an instant liking to the game. It became a staple of letsplayers screaming and fans requesting to see their idols scared.\n\nHopes for a sequel were high and the announcement that "A Machine for Pigs" would follow in the footsteps of The Dark Descent got people hopeful. The end result, for some reason, disappointed a lot of fans.\n\nMaybe this has more to do with me not truly seeing Amensia for many years, but I found Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs to be great. It certainly is different from Dark Descent, but it's no less tense or solid.\n\nA Machine for Pigs deals with some incredibly disturbing and dark subject matter. This is almost the video game equivalent to that ridiculous scene in Pink Floyd's "The Wall" where kids are fed into a meat grinder. The plot line follows the dimentia of a man who obtains the orb from the previous game and goes insane.\n\nTo write it all out would utterly ruin the intrigue and mystery that surrounds every inch of this game. So I'll stop there and talk more about the game itself. Following in the vein of developer TheChineseRoom's previous game, Dear Esther, A Machine for Pigs is more about crafting and presenting a gripping narrative then it is with scares and gameplay.\n\nThere are still puzzles and enemies to deal with, but it's far simpler then before. Your interactivity with the world is cut down dramatically, so puzzles stop being about logic and deal more with you noticing an object on the ground. It's kind of sad, as I loved the mind teasers that were peppered throughout Dark Descent.\n\nThe enemy design is outstanding, but their AI is mostly the same (if not worse) then before. The Pig guards will run at you, but they can easily be outrun or simply dodged by shutting off your latern. It makes for moments that are definitely intense, but lack the kind of frailty that was so prevalent in Dark Descent.\n\nThat and a lot of the situations (both in puzzles and enemy encounters) feel like repeats of the first game. You get a similar confrontation with a water beast and often have to insert cogs and turn wheels to get the ball rolling. Towards the end of the game, you ride so many elevators that it almost becomes comical.\n\nThe presentation of everything is what really sells this. The graphics are nice and sharp and the music is just wonderful. A lot of scenes become transcendental in nature simply because of how every elements comes together. While the game doesn't ditch the diary pages from before, it's main narrative isn't hidden away by static screens.\n\nYou get constant narration from your character and some interaction with the game's antagonist. The voice overs are more compelling then the previous game and the plot takes an unexpected turn that packs a real punch at the finale. It's mesmerizing and makes for a great time.\n\nMy main gripe is just that a lot of the gameplay is stripped out. I loved exploring each environment in Dark Descent and figuring out how to progress. A Machine for Pigs is linear to a fault. Even in a big city, you only have one path to go on. Dark Descent reveled in giving you multiple things to do with no set guideline.\n\nThat aside, the overall package is just awesome. It may not be any more horror filled then it's predecessor, but it's definitely a worthy follow-up and a good experience. If you love dark, twisted fantasy, then don't pass this up.\n\n8/10","October 31, 2015","true","2.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Like many, I came in expecting a proper follow-up to Amnesia: The Dark Descent. That game set some extraordinarily high expectations, none of which are fulfilled in this sequel. Where the first game provided an ample amount of terror thru the use of clever level design, interesting puzzle-solving and a haunting atmosphere, A Machine For Pigs decides to ditch everything but the atmosphere. You won't find any difficult puzzles in AMfP; in fact, I can only think of one time where I barely had to use my brain to progress thru the narrative. The rest of the story is largely an on-rails narrative, in the realm of an interactive novel rather than a video game. Having played The Chinese Room's Gone Home, I had a feeling that the follow-up to Amnesia: The Dark Descent would be more focused on story-telling. I had no idea how strictly that model would come to define the folow-up to one of video gaming's greatest horror tales. A Machine For Pigs is a beautiful narrative, enanced by moody lighting and an emotionally stirring soundtrack. Though I was very dissapointed to find that many features from the first game were removed - namely, the sanity meter and the necessity to manage resources - I still found this game enjoyable and satisyfing. My best advice for enjoying this game is to understand that this is NOT a sequel to Amnesia: The Dark Descent in any stretch of the imagination. It is a stand-alone narrative featuring entirely new characters and a new setting. The gameplay mechanics are severely lscking, even compared to the minimal interaction compared to the first game, However if you are looking to try something different, and enjoy a good horror story, then A Machine for Pigs is worth your time and money. Just not $20 of it.","November 1, 2015","true","7.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It has some obvious problems, mostly to do with the linearity and lack of puzzles. Perhaps this was a choice by The Chinese Room, who made the snorefest "Dear Escher." On the other hand, it's not like the puzzles in Dark Descent were actually GOOD. So, if you're after the same thing I'm after--impeccable set design full of dark winding passages and horrifying creatures lurking just out of sight--you'll be pleased once again. In fact, this game has something that Dark Descent was lacking: a truly striking and effective story. It makes a surprisingly big difference, I found, grounding the protagonist's goals in a search for his missing children. And once you discover the true nature of the evil lurking in the tunnels under London, it will give you a lot more to think about than the rituals of Alexander ever did in Dark Descent.","November 1, 2015","true","7.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/scrubsauce/recommended/239200/","scrubsauce","Scrubsauce","http://steamcommunity.com/id/scrubsauce/","394 products in account","I went into Machine for Pigs (MfP) with a bit of static in my ears.  My friends who had played the game gave me a very mixed feel on the game, plenty of negative to go with the positive, so I went in with somewhat lowered expectations.  I played Dark Descent years ago, and the Penumbra trilogy more recently, and right out of the gate it was obvious that though this game shared the Amnesia moniker, it was not a Frictional endeavour.\n\nThe only Chinese Room game I've played before was Dear Esther, and as much flak as that game receives I found enjoyment in the atmosphere the developers were able to build into such a short experience.  MfP helps the developers carry on that trend, but it gives them much more breathing room.  The extended length (~4-7 hours depending on your hurry) plays to the developers' favor and shows they can make a full length experience with a beginning, middle, and end.  The world MfP builds for the player is as much a social commentary on recent human history as it is a spooky romp through underground, industrial revolution England with tons of pig-based imagery.  While the ties to Dark Descent are minimal and fleeting, MfP manages to stand on its own as a new narrative in a new setting with new characters and still be captivating.  However, if you don't listen closely to the various notes and conversations scattered throughout the campaign, things can get a little confusing.  Even after beating the game I found myself googling portions of the plot to get a better understanding of what had just happened.\n\nThe main complaint I see/hear for MfP is that the horror pales in comparison to Dark Descent and I'm inclined to agree.  While Dark Descent terrified me from beginning to end, MfP suffers from the same issues as the Slender series in that after a certain point, prolonged exposure to the intiially "mysterious" creepies haunting you makes them significantly less mysterious, and minimizes their ability to inspire terror in the player.  However, I don't feel like it was Chinese Room's intent for the monsters to be the source of horror the whole way through the game.  Without going into plot spoilers, the narrative makes it a point to expose the monsters to the player to help make sense of the plot, and the horror stops being this abstract thing going bump in the night to an internal sense of fear and anxiety over the actions of the player.\n\nWith that last statement in mind, I can totally agree with the Bioshock comparisons.  MfP is every bit as deep as Bioshock Infinite, without the paradoxical nature of the protagonist running around gunning down hundreds of NPC's for the sake of AAA gun-play mechanics.\n\nSo if you're interested in an Irrational-style mind-trip, MfP is the game for you.  Just don't go in expecting to be scared out of your wits the whole way through.","November 3, 2015","true","6.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The graphics are nice and sharp and the music is just wonderful. A lot of scenes become transcendental in nature simply because of how every elements comes together. While the game doesn't ditch the diary pages from before, it's main narrative isn't hidden away by static screens.\n\nYou get constant narration from your character and some interaction with the game's antagonist. The voice overs are more compelling then the previous game and the plot takes an unexpected turn that packs a real punch at the finale. It's mesmerizing and makes for a great time.\n\nMy main gripe is just that a lot of the gameplay is stripped out. I loved exploring each environment in Dark Descent and figuring out how to progress. A Machine for Pigs is linear to a fault. Even in a big city, you only have one path to go on. Dark Descent reveled in giving you multiple things to do with no set guideline.\n\nThat aside, the overall package is just awesome. It may not be any more horror filled then it's predecessor, but it's definitely a worthy follow-up and a good experience. If you love dark, twisted fantasy, then don't pass this up.\n\n8/10","October 31, 2015","true","2.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/disscravis/recommended/239200/","disscravis","disscravis","http://steamcommunity.com/id/disscravis/","42 products in account","I'm so very conflicted about this game. Like many, I came in expecting a proper follow-up to Amnesia: The Dark Descent. That game set some extraordinarily high expectations, none of which are fulfilled in this sequel. Where the first game provided an ample amount of terror thru the use of clever level design, interesting puzzle-solving and a haunting atmosphere, A Machine For Pigs decides to ditch everything but the atmosphere. You won't find any difficult puzzles in AMfP; in fact, I can only think of one time where I barely had to use my brain to progress thru the narrative. The rest of the story is largely an on-rails narrative, in the realm of an interactive novel rather than a video game. Having played The Chinese Room's Gone Home, I had a feeling that the follow-up to Amnesia: The Dark Descent would be more focused on story-telling. I had no idea how strictly that model would come to define the folow-up to one of video gaming's greatest horror tales. A Machine For Pigs is a beautiful narrative, enanced by moody lighting and an emotionally stirring soundtrack. Though I was very dissapointed to find that many features from the first game were removed - namely, the sanity meter and the necessity to manage resources - I still found this game enjoyable and satisyfing. My best advice for enjoying this game is to understand that this is NOT a sequel to Amnesia: The Dark Descent in any stretch of the imagination. It is a stand-alone narrative featuring entirely new characters and a new setting. The gameplay mechanics are severely lscking, even compared to the minimal interaction compared to the first game, However if you are looking to try something different, and enjoy a good horror story, then A Machine for Pigs is worth your time and money. Just not $20 of it.","November 1, 2015","true","7.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It has some obvious problems, mostly to do with the linearity and lack of puzzles. Perhaps this was a choice by The Chinese Room, who made the snorefest "Dear Escher." On the other hand, it's not like the puzzles in Dark Descent were actually GOOD. So, if you're after the same thing I'm after--impeccable set design full of dark winding passages and horrifying creatures lurking just out of sight--you'll be pleased once again. In fact, this game has something that Dark Descent was lacking: a truly striking and effective story. It makes a surprisingly big difference, I found, grounding the protagonist's goals in a search for his missing children. And once you discover the true nature of the evil lurking in the tunnels under London, it will give you a lot more to think about than the rituals of Alexander ever did in Dark Descent.","November 1, 2015","true","7.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/scrubsauce/recommended/239200/","scrubsauce","Scrubsauce","http://steamcommunity.com/id/scrubsauce/","394 products in account","I went into Machine for Pigs (MfP) with a bit of static in my ears.  My friends who had played the game gave me a very mixed feel on the game, plenty of negative to go with the positive, so I went in with somewhat lowered expectations.  I played Dark Descent years ago, and the Penumbra trilogy more recently, and right out of the gate it was obvious that though this game shared the Amnesia moniker, it was not a Frictional endeavour.\n\nThe only Chinese Room game I've played before was Dear Esther, and as much flak as that game receives I found enjoyment in the atmosphere the developers were able to build into such a short experience.  MfP helps the developers carry on that trend, but it gives them much more breathing room.  The extended length (~4-7 hours depending on your hurry) plays to the developers' favor and shows they can make a full length experience with a beginning, middle, and end.  The world MfP builds for the player is as much a social commentary on recent human history as it is a spooky romp through underground, industrial revolution England with tons of pig-based imagery.  While the ties to Dark Descent are minimal and fleeting, MfP manages to stand on its own as a new narrative in a new setting with new characters and still be captivating.  However, if you don't listen closely to the various notes and conversations scattered throughout the campaign, things can get a little confusing.  Even after beating the game I found myself googling portions of the plot to get a better understanding of what had just happened.\n\nThe main complaint I see/hear for MfP is that the horror pales in comparison to Dark Descent and I'm inclined to agree.  While Dark Descent terrified me from beginning to end, MfP suffers from the same issues as the Slender series in that after a certain point, prolonged exposure to the intiially "mysterious" creepies haunting you makes them significantly less mysterious, and minimizes their ability to inspire terror in the player.  However, I don't feel like it was Chinese Room's intent for the monsters to be the source of horror the whole way through the game.  Without going into plot spoilers, the narrative makes it a point to expose the monsters to the player to help make sense of the plot, and the horror stops being this abstract thing going bump in the night to an internal sense of fear and anxiety over the actions of the player.\n\nWith that last statement in mind, I can totally agree with the Bioshock comparisons.  MfP is every bit as deep as Bioshock Infinite, without the paradoxical nature of the protagonist running around gunning down hundreds of NPC's for the sake of AAA gun-play mechanics.\n\nSo if you're interested in an Irrational-style mind-trip, MfP is the game for you.  Just don't go in expecting to be scared out of your wits the whole way through.","November 3, 2015","true","6.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The first Amnesia was published AND created by Frictional Games. Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs is a great horror game, but not as great as Amnesia: The Dark Descent. This has several reasons:\n1. You have unlimited light\n2. No health is shown, but mosty 2 hits are enough to kill you.\n3. Everytime you meet an enemy, your lamp and the lights nearby start to flicker. So you will be warned if something dangerous is near you. That's the point I have to critisize. A horror game shouldn't warn you of horror things, it must surprise you! If I get warned all the time then I won't be so scared because I know some pig is waiting there. I want to move without knowing what awaits me in the next corner.\n4. No inventory for items, because you don't have to activate your brain and collect and combine different items anymore!\n-> 5. Really easy puzzles, you can't compare it with the first Amnesia.\n6. The story in Amnesia: The Dark Descent was better and a little bit longer than in this one. You just play a psychopath who has deep psycho-problems with himself... The whole game is about himself and his noob-life.\n\nBut now to the good points:\nIt is still a very good horror game. If you loved Amnesia: The Dark Descent, you will like Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs. But the first Amnesia was a lot scarier and harder. Anyway, definitely a good game and I hope the next Amnesia will be developed and published by Frictional Games. :P","November 9, 2013","true","6.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Firstly, I was under the impression they sacrificed gameplay for narrative, which I had no problem with, but there was a lot of instances where I had to think on my feet and search for clues to solve a puzzle, which I'd been told were not that intuitive. Besides that, the major aspects of the gameplay, besides the puzzle solving, are maze-like segments where you have to avoid the pig men al a the old minotaur story from Greek mythology. I died my fair share of times at these parts. All in all I'd say it's pretty solid on the gameplay front.\n\nNow most of the game is set in an old victorian era factory, which may be my favourite period aesthetic-wise. The atmosphere is very well delivered. Not too many jumpy bits, it aims more for a sense of desperation and chlaustrophobia as you delve deeper and deeper into the machine, but from there on it falls short. The story is incredibly predictable. You can piece it together quite easily from just a few diary entries so the rest of the game is waiting for the inevitable.\n\nIt was quite long too, for such a game. I've played my fair share of half-decent graphics indie games that just fell short of the 3 hour mark, but I got nearly 8 out of this.\n\nNow, I'm not gonna reccomend this wholeheartedly. If you want a game with good horror atmosphere without relying on gore or copious amounts of jumpscares, you should pick this up in a sale.\n\nOr get the first one, where the game makes you feel like you have much more to lose. Probably because you do, but I didn't come here to compare them.

A lot of the horror element comes from the suspense. Where you'll see the monsters next, crashes and clangs that echo through the world, and the music. Some of the horror is self-made. You don't see any threat, but you think it might be around the next corner. There are definitely a lot of moments where jumpscares or threats can make you want to scream, don't get me wrong.\n\nThe plot is really well-done with a few twists that some may see coming. Mandus is traveling deeper into the factory complex and you gain a lot of the story through journal entries and recordings scattered around. You also talk to a mysterious man over the phones.

This game is not scary at all. Unless you have a grudge against pigmen, or you're not too familiar with the horror genre; this game and it's atmosphere are simply not frightening. In fact, listening to this would be more scarier: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8E1_YbypkQ&feature=player_detailpage\n\nAnyway, about the game... When thinking about TDD, everyone seems to talk about how atmospheric and scary the game was. For me, it was the story that ultimately caught my attention. So much that it was worth buying it again, and replaying it for the story alone. With AMFP, I bought it for the same reasons. Except, where TDD excelled, AMFP seemed to have falled behind completely.\n\nThe story in AMFP was rather lackluster, and sadly predictable. Nothing in the game felt new and or exciting. Storywise, it's narative definitely harkens back to classic horror literature. Allowing the player to imagine these situations, as oppossed to seeing them. But with the game's rapid pacing, and very graphic auditory descriptions; this game felt more like a modern day horror, that focuses on more "gore" than atmosphere.\nPlaying AMFP's story just felt like a mix between Afterfall InSanity and BioShock. For the most part, the game was like the first part of BioShock. Except, where BioShock continued, AMFP just ends. Which got me wishing there was more after "the end.". And without spoiling anything, Afterfall InSanity did a much better job at telling a similar story, imo.\n\nAs for gameplay, it was surprisingly poor. Gameplay was very minimal compared to TDD. Gone is the object interaction (which doesn't really affect gameplay); the inventory (so there is no "survival" concept); the oil lamp (now it's a lantern with unlimited energy); and the enviorment puzzles, which made TDD much more than just a "scary game." What really felt missing however, was the whole stealth game mechanic that TDD had.\nNo longer do you need to run away from the monsters, or quickly find the hiding place. In AMFP, it's all about observing the pigmens' walk pattern, and hiding from them. Sounds the same, except there are no "hiding places." The AI was also dumb and ridiculous. In fact, you could just simply run in circles and they still won't catch you. You could even sneak up to them, without them noticing. It also takes a few hits for most of the pigmen to actually kill you, which doesn't really help the game's cause.\n\nOverall, AMFP is not worth the $20 or $15 price, even for the story. I'd say, for less than $5, sure. Besides, this is a short game with lag issues here and there. You can even find TDD custom stories that are much more worthwhile than AMFP.","September 30, 2013","false","7.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It delivers a great atmosphere and a fascinating storyline but it did not really scare me. Rather, it was a creepy experience telling a sick story. It felt great to uncover the mystery of the environment and the developments happening in the background.\nEven though this is not as scary as the original Amnesia, it is a great game with a creepy atmosphere and great storytelling. The soundscape is phenomenal and keeps you immersed throughout the game.\nIf the original Amnesia was too horrible for youm but you are somehow fascinated by such games, this is definetely worth checking out!","October 7, 2013","true","4.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

If you go in expecting Amnesia: The Dark Descent 2 then you'll ultimately be disappointed, but if you approach it in the spirit of Dear Esther and Korsakovia with a side order of Amnesia then you'll be more likely to gain something from the experience.\n\nVery atmospheric, thanks mainly to the incredible sound design that sounds like something ripped out of David Lynch's Eraserhead and The Elephant Man. Plenty of scares, but perhaps not as much real danger or a sense of urgency as the narrative otherwise implies.\n\nThe narrative is largely driven by notes and audio logs, so if you miss some of them (easy to do) then you may find yourself missing a few pieces of the puzzle.\n\nThe end sequence is way too long and protracted (I found myself rushing through the last hour or so) but everything that comes before is well worth experiencing.","September 14, 2013","true","11.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Not really all that scary when compared to the harrowing experience of its predecessor, Amnesia: Dark Descent, or the pure terror of the recently released Outlast, A Machine for Pigs deals more in psychologically disturbing stuff than in-your-face boogeymen and buckets of guts.\n\nIt's only halfway successful though, since I didn't really enjoy it as much as the other games I've mentioned. The story is intriguing, but the puzzles are way too easy and enemy encounters are few and far between. Graphically, the Frictional Engine is starting to show its age as well, however sound design and music are great.\n\nOverall, A Machine for Pigs is a slight disappointment, especially if you're expecting a ride similar to the original Amnesia.","September 11, 2013","true","5.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Any atmosphere or tension is killed by the verbose, turgid voiceovers and there's literally nothing to do except walk through boring dark corridors full of pipes and dials. You're often forced to backtrack to try every single door in the area to find the one that's been arbitrarily unlocked so you can progress further. In the first Amnesia the monsters were scary, in this game they are just annoying humanoid pigs.\n\nI really can't see who this game is aimed at. It's not even really a game, it's just a tedious slog through empty environments with stupid puzzles and some Victorian-sounding narration thrown in. It's also only about 3.5 hours long, but to be honest that is merciful considering how boring it is.\n\nSave your money and go buy Outlast instead.","September 11, 2013","false","3.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

AMFP is more story oriented, has a great and creative story and makes you immerse in a world that is complete strange to you.

Even half the reviews from Dark Descent fans here don't like it.\n\nHere is 90% of the game:\n\n1. Walk around empty environment looking for a level/valve to pull to open up a door to advance.\n2. Every 5 minutes, an earthquake or meaningless ambient sound or pointless voiceover flashback will cause the screen to go blurry and slow your character to a crawl for a couple seconds.\n\nThat's it. I'm not joking. That's almost the entire game. There aren't even any items, inventory, or resources to worry about. I would have been fine with this since that aspect of Dark Descent annoyed me, but they didn't replace it with anything interesting here. There are free horror Flash games with more depth and interaction.\n\nEven though I didn't like Dark Descent, at least there was  the interest in pushing forward in order to find out why your character was in this environment. You had amnesia with a note from yourself telling you to kill some man, and you spend the game finding out why. In Machine for Pigs, you have a plot that's pointlessly obtuse only to distract you from how boring it is. Your character wakes up and mumbles something about the children running into the basement where apparently you set up an industrialized slaughter house. Most of the notes and journals you pick up are confusing and worthless to sheddding any light on anything. They're just there to waste your time and try to trick you into thinking there's some DEEP MEANING to this pretentious naval gazing nonsense.\n\nJust worthless. HOW bad is it?

What can I say about it. This game cannot (and must not) be compared to the previous Amnesia game. For one, the two games are developed by two different companies, and the way these two companies created both master pieces, is similar YET very different. AMFP is more story oriented, has a great and creative story and makes you immerse in a world that is complete strange to you. I gave this game a 9 just because the game wasnt scary cause i believe the first game was way scarier) but because is unique, it shows that they put a lot of effort on writing it and this is why i loved it.

Very creepy, very moody.  The sound design was absolutely perfect, and set the tone for the entire game.  When compared to it's predecessor (Amnesia: The Dark Descent), however, it can be dissapointing because of the removal of a lot of the difficulty that game was known for.  All survival horror elements have been stripped from the game.  No more sanity, no more limited source of light fuel, which all takes away from the strategy of the game and makes it more of just a "Horror" game, and that is why people are dissapointed by it.  The game is still VERY scary and worth playing if you like horror games, and there are moments of real danger and enemies that will kill you, and some very inventive puzzles.  It is the type of game that you need to just let yourself be immersed in the story and design.  Read every journal entry, and every book you pickup.  The story is well done and very interesting.\n\nMy only real complaint about it is that besides the title and a few vague refrences to the Brennenberg serum, this game has very little to do with Dark Descent.  It may have been more well received by the public if amnesia and all references to it were dropped from the title and it was just called "Machine for Pigs".","November 28, 2013","true","4.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Even half the reviews from Dark Descent fans here don't like it.\n\nHere is 90% of the game:\n\n1. Walk around empty environment looking for a level/valve to pull to open up a door to advance.\n2. Every 5 minutes, an earthquake or meaningless ambient sound or pointless voiceover flashback will cause the screen to go blurry and slow your character to a crawl for a couple seconds.\n\nThat's it. I'm not joking. That's almost the entire game. There aren't even any items, inventory, or resources to worry about. I would have been fine with this since that aspect of Dark Descent annoyed me, but they didn't replace it with anything interesting here. There are free horror Flash games with more depth and interaction.\n\nEven though I didn't like Dark Descent, at least there was  the interest in pushing forward in order to find out why your character was in this environment. You had amnesia with a note from yourself telling you to kill some man, and you spend the game finding out why. In Machine for Pigs, you have a plot that's pointlessly obtuse only to distract you from how boring it is. Your character wakes up and mumbles something about the children running into the basement where apparently you set up an industrialized slaughter house. Most of the notes and journals you pick up are confusing and worthless to sheddding any light on anything. They're just there to waste your time and try to trick you into thinking there's some DEEP MEANING to this pretentious naval gazing nonsense.\n\nJust worthless. HOW bad is it? I honestly think this might be a worse atmospheric walking simulator than Gone Home. Yes, it's THAT bad.","March 23, 2015","false","0.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Feels like one overwhelmingly long button-pressing sequence due to poor pacing, repetitive environments, and a complete lack of urgency.\n\nThe long - A large part of the game is spent meandering around mansions and steam shops, pressing buttons, and waiting for people to stop talking about vaguely creepy things that you won't understand, and frankly, will completely forgot about until the next telephone segment. Puzzles range from simply pressing a button, to holding a button, and then wiggling the mouse a bit. Sometimes you have to find an object, and then put it in another, bigger object. Sometimes, twice!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kaocrat/recommended/239200/","kaocrat","kaocrat","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kaocrat/","259 products in account","Short summary: don't buy it or play it. Not worth your time or your money. Oh, you want to know why? I'll lay out some points below, but in brief: they removed or botched every distinguishing characteristic of the previous Amnesia game (and Frictional Games in general), and replaced those characteristics with . . . nothing. What you're left with is a series of spooky but poorly realized environments and a scenario/story which has a lot of potential but isn't fleshed out or conveyed very effectively. If you love the original Amnesia, play it again. Or play one of the fan-made scenarios (there are some great ones). Or play the Penumbra games (they're very very good). Just don't play A Machine for Pigs.\n\nThings you should know about A Machine for Pigs:\n\n• Lots of cut and paste art assets. You'll see the same paintings, desk lamps, sacks of inexplicably fresh potatoes, chairs, desks, barrels, crates, and wall textures everywhere. This would be fine in a 1st person shooter or something where environment is secondary, but inexcusable in atmospheric horror where you are supposed to be piecing a story together based on environmental cues.\n\n• No interactivity. In the original Amnesia and other games by Frictional, you could pick up most small objects, open every drawer and cupboard, and push around most larger objects even if you couldn't lift them. In addition to being the basis for some great puzzles, the physics system created a much-needed sense of *presence* and gave life to the environments. (Rooting through a pile of rubble, throwing items off to the side, to find a useful item underneath, is more engaging than clicking on an item sitting on a shelf, for example.)  You can’t even jump on top of most low objects nor crawl under most gaps.\n\nIn Machine for Pigs, you can pick up chairs, and you can open *some* desk drawers and doors. That's about it, except for puzzle-specific objects. Most egregiously, the game is full of "doors" and "cabinets" which you cannot interact with in any way. In Dark Descent, you could try to open one and it would at least rattle and maybe you'd get a message that it's locked. In this game? Nothing. Your cursor doesn't even change when you mouse over the door or cabinet. It's basically a wall with a door texture on it. This reduces the game to a "pixel hunt" where you move your cursor over every object and surface in a room to figure out which thing is interactive (usually nothing is).\n\n• No inventory. There are no items to collect, examine, combine, and use to solve puzzles. There are no tinder boxes for lighting torches, and your lantern never runs out of oil so there is no need to find lantern oil. Not a problem on its own, but combined with lifeless, non-interactive environments and it means there's nothing to actually *do* in this game.\n\n• No game mechanics. No sanity or health or lamp oil to manage. Few enemies and they mostly appear at pre-scripted moments for chase sequences. You never have to make any risk/reward type decisions, and this makes the game feel very low-stakes.\n\n• Story and scenario are not sufficiently realized. I think they needed a bigger budget and more time for this. Won’t go into details but suffice to say it’s a grandiose premise which could have been the basis for something great, but this is not how it panned out.","July 8, 2015","false","4.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Sadly, my expectations were lowered in my time with it. Put in the simplest of terms, Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs is disappointing as an Amnesia game. As a story-focused adventure and modern horror game, it's recommended. It's a good effort from Dear Esther developer The Chinese Room, and the atmosphere is still much better than many modern horror games. It can still creep out and possibily scary you. But as a sequel to Amnesia: The Dark Descent, an absolutely terrifying delight of a horror game, it comes up short in multiple ways. Many game elements were removed, including the inventory screen and Lovecraftian-inspired sanity meter. The inventory screen leads to overly clunky puzzles, while the sanity meter is a sadly missed feature that removes the balancing act between light and shadow. The game is also made somewhat easier by the lantern having an unlimited power supply and the complete removal of tinderboxes. Finally, while the story is nicely written, it seems to follow the same pattern of the story in Amnesia: The Dark Descent. This essentially boils down to the phrase "not an Amnesia game". While cliched, it is sadly true. It just doesn't feel like the original or like a game from Frictional Games. It's clearly a sort-of successor to Dear Esther, and it does work on that level. So, if you're looking for the horror equivalent of Gone Home or Dear Esther, then Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs will satisfy. But otherwise, you're better off with the first one.","April 22, 2015","false","0.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

If you do, you will be disappointed.  If you do not, you will enjoy the experience profusely.\n\nWhile the game itself is not inherently horrifying, I thoroughly suggest this title to any gamer with a passion for story, atmosphere, and philosophy.  The narration was immaculate, and the ending phenomenal.  When you enter this game, expect not a mere horror game, simply for the sake of a scare, rather, an introspective plot characterized by a dismal, Victorian setting and atmosphere.  I must say, as a gamer with an interest for philosophy and atmosphere, I ended up enjoying this game even more than the original, and I grew to appreciate the characters moreso than the original.  However, only play this game if you are willing to sacrifice the scare factor for other qualities.  It may not be particularly scary, but this game has rightfully earned its place as my favorite survival-horror title.","December 17, 2015","true","8.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I myself, have a fear of man-made interiors, small-spaces, and darkness.  That comprises a good 2/3 of the environments in this game.  It felt very much to me like I was inside one of my own nightmares.  I loved the exterior/house sections too for world building purposes, but I was actually excited when the game switches to "descent mode".\n\nThe antagonist in this game is easily one of the BEST antagonists in any video game I have ever played.  This guy makes one of the most twisted horrendous plans that no one sane should able to even conceptualize... and actually partially accomlishes it.  All for the classic betterment of humanity.  I love the antagonist of this game.  10/10.\n\nThe sound is tear-jerking.  This includes bgm, voice acting, and random noises.  There's also a great deal of variation in bgm, from full out opera, classical, eerie ambiance, and then even ragtime loaded with political satire during the credits.\nThe voices and scripting are beautiful too.  This game is very poetic, like reading a good Edgar Allan Poe Poem.  Feels very quotable.  I also personally love how the main character refers to his family as "darling."  And like any good horror game, random noises attempt to keep you on edge always, though once you know you're probably not in danger you can numb yourself to the scratches, whispers, and footsteps.\n\nStory.  This is one point that even some of the worst critics of this game usually give.  What makes this story so good is that it is relatable.  It poses a "what if" scenario, that is terrifying because it can be conceptualized in reality to a certain extent.  Not to mention it plays on a primal fear of losing control, and highlights the tragedy of some of the darkest ages of actual historical past.\n\nI must mention the negatives, because indeed there are a few, which some people would consider these "game-destroying".  This game is somewhere in-between an interactive movie and an actual game.  You can indeed die if you're not attentive, are free to move around a limited environment, and there are a few pretty simple puzzles.  However there is no inventory, which means no typical Penumbra/Amnesia puzzles, worrying about your lantern oil, healing with laudanum (probably why it's hard to die).  There aren't many "jump-scares" or adrenaline pumping danger danger horror.  This game focuses on a deeper type of horror more akin to analyzing a deeply psychological nightmare than primal adrenaline reactionary horror.  Fine in my opinion to have those, but if you're looking for a danger around ever corner monster monster freak out session... don't expect to find it.  More saddening to me then anything else is the lack of the screeching noise whenever a monster is nearby... though the flickering light works pretty well too.\n\nTo me, this game is art.  The setting is beautiful and surreal, the sound is moving, and the story makes it hard for me to immerse myself in other shallower horror stories now.  If you consider the purchase of this game, make sure you're looking for an experience and not a jump-scare.\n","December 10, 2015","true","7.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"
