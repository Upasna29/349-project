Okay, so here's a maze chase game between you and a zombified child except one of you can walk through the maze walls and the other can't. Two guesses as to who gets to wield that obscene power. This is actually unplayable. It's clear that from the start of the game, Zombie Kid spawns in the opposite corner of the maze and just zeroes in your position, striding through walls like the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Juggernaut until she either traps you in a dead end and just stands there waiting for you to end the game or suddenly no-clips through a wall to do it herself.\nDifficulty ranges from Easy to Brutal but doesn't seem to have any impact on the game. Admittedly, I didn't try Brutal although I predict that doing so would give her a skateboard or the power of flight.\nCheck out the video below for a glimpse at this utter catastrophe.\nhttps://youtu.be/-DVSlxsaEuc","July 7, 2015","false","1.0"," 186 of 199 people (93%) found this review helpful 84 people found this review funny","93","186","199","84","10"

It's not often that you see THOSE words pop up on-screen in a game (unless, perhaps, you're the programmer themselves doing a demo run).  This occurred after many, many minutes of running down literally IDENTICAL stone corridors, and was the result of me going, "Hmmm, that's the first thing I've seen even vaguely resembling a nasty in this game" - in the form of a spooky little girl with ♥♥♥♥ed-up eyes - and wondering what would happen if I walked up and said "hello" to her.  Result:  "End Game Triggered."  Which, apart from some tiny words in a corner of the screen, basically added up to a brief image of her up close-'n'-personal before my game, well...ENDED, oddly enough.\n\n"Play again?"  Hmmm...sure, guess I'll humour this a WEE bit longer...but alas, skipping between the three different maps, some of which feature rain and others which feature a snowy blizzard, still doesn't suggest that there's much VARIETY to be found here.  What's more, it seems drastically underfinished...again, the word "demo" springs to mind.  Hell, your footsteps don't even make a sound in the corridors of the great pyramid of Giza, and apart from some quite lovely music there doesn't seem to be any other "sound design" whatsoever.  Though oddly enough, I don't see the words "Early Access" anywhere on the Store page...\n\nThere's a serious lack of fresh ideas in the horror genre of late.  Some obscure little game called Amnesia gave the genre a much-needed boot up the rear some years ago, and "stealth horror" masterpieces such as Outlast, Alien: Isolation and Among The Sleep have slightly raised the bar since then.  This is one game destined to NOT join the ranks of those masterpieces, and while it doesn't necessarily "lower" the bar any, it has perhaps one good "idea" in its tiny little head...namely, the dropping of flares like breadcrumbs to know where you have and haven't been yet.  This IS a bit of a necessity, though, given that the scenery is so gosh-darned SAMEISH that you wouldn't have the foggiest what you're doing otherwise!  And that's about where the "innovation" of this one ends.\n\nNow, I'm not saying there isn't any potential here.  Although the serious lack of any STORY - these are just one-off "maps" - means that this won't be going down in history as a horror "classic" or anything, no matter how hard the devs try to save it.  But DO the devs have any intentions whatsoever of improving on what they have here (which isn't really that much)?  I cannot, in all good conscience, recommend this until some serious improvements/embellishments are made.  And ten bucks, full price, is just a sad joke.  Here's hoping that the folks behind this AREN'T just hit-'n'-run opportunists, and they do enough work to make their "game" worth at least HALF the price they're currently asking.  I won't be holding my breath, however, given that the devs chose to call themselves Undead Yeti Software...'nuff said?!\n\nVerdict: 3/10.","July 7, 2015","false","1.0"," 158 of 179 people (88%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","88","158","179","11","6"

Simple elements are absent. There's no sound effects for the rain or footsteps; performance is low in many places, motion blur is too high... hell, the pause menu indicates a 'Game Over' screen.\n\nWorst of all, there is no surprise or suspense with the jumpscare (if you can even call it that). The control is taken away from the player, and the pacing of the game is slowed down, right before a very low-poly model of a zombie child 'attacks' you. There's no fun, and no variety in the environments, or in the scares.\n\nThere's certain parts that could have potential, but this is very beta-esque. And that price tag??? For this? Unreasonable. I filed for a refund after about a half hour of attempted gameplay (I will have a rather humorous LP video of it up, soon.)\n\nRemember the movie 'The Room'? It was so bad that it was good? This kind of feels like that, only it's a game. It's kinda fun to laugh at it, actually, and that's what I enjoyed in my LP video. But, that's short-lived. Some super-big changes will need to be taken (haha, get it?) before I reconsider purchasing this game.\n\nP.S. Thank you, Valve, for refunds.","July 8, 2015","false","0.5"," 51 of 54 people (94%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","94","51","54","3","0"

I could talk about how laughable the horror is in this game, hell I could talk about how this game is more comedy material then a horror game all thanks to the little girl in the game but you know what, I wont.\n\nThe developer's behind this game admitted this game isn't perfect, it has problems and the release price was to high for what it was, but they at the least admitted this was their first PC game compared to the mobile games they developed. As bad as this game may seem I'll admit that they made a game that at the least works, something I have never come close to in my life even with RPG maker for god's sake? All game developers start off with crap but at the same time they learn from their mistakes and work on something better down the road, correcting what was wrong with their past games while learning to do far more in the future.\n\nYa I'm still giving this game a negative review because it's not a good game, but if the developer admits to whats wrong with the game and take in the negative reviews for future use then good for them, your already taking it better then some people in the gam","January 12","false","0.1"," 22 of 22 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","22","22","0","0"

(Daylight, Time Ramesside)\n\nOn the easiest difficulty you can complete this so called "first person indie horror game" in less than 10 minutes. If you crank up the difficulty the game just add a chasing ghost. There is only two levels in the game : the maze and the house. The maze is a total mess as it is so confusing to navigate through. The house, on the other hand is pretty much straightfoward. So basically what you do in the game is : 1) find your way in the maze, 2) find a giant skull that teleports you in a house, 3) pick up a key, 4) return to the maze, 5) find the exit. At the end you are greeted with a congratulation screen. And the plot, what about it? There's none. Not really rewarding, isn't it?\n\nThe only positive things about TAKEN is that you're given the choice between three types of ambiance/esthetic and five difficulty modes before getting into gameplay.\n\nLet's hope Liam Neeson never find out about this game.\n\nHere's my playthrough :\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aos8nuYLFw\n\nRating :\n1.0","September 9, 2015","false","0.2"," 18 of 19 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","18","19","0","0"

Having said that I can't recomend this in any way. There is no rhyme or reason to it, it is a maze that changes with something in it trying to kill you, and there is no way to defend yourself against said bad guy. I was able to escape only once, and it was more surprising than triumphant or enjoyable. The storyline is not well explained and not very believable. However, it is not real glitchy so that is one plus to the game developers.
