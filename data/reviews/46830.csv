"http://steamcommunity.com/id/csn290/recommended/46830/","csn290","theCarthaginian","http://steamcommunity.com/id/csn290/","46 products in account","This game seems like an awesome idea... and given a bit more development, it would be.\nAs it is, it feels utterly generic and horribly limited.\n\nThere were literally dozens of classes of warship in service within the British Royal Navy in the year 1866. It was a unique time, filled with unique vessels and amazing variety. The ships here are few in number and similar in characteristics. A little more inclusion would have given so much more flavor! The Russians... well, their navy was a bit more limited, but they also had some interesting vessels.\nThe game engine is very simplistic with few options for action. The time complession is completely inadequate for the vessels and their speed of advance. The AI is almost intelligent as Vice-Admiral Sir George Tryon and has an annoying tendency to ram any moving object nearby... particularly when they are flying the same colors. At least the gunnery is historically accurate; gunners cannot hit the broadside of the enemy ship unless they are < 100 yards away.\n\nAll in all, it was worth less than the $3 or so I paid for it.","February 18, 2014","false","0.2"," 49 of 58 people (84%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","84","49","58","2","0"

There aren't that many tactical naval simulators around unfortunately, and the few that do exist tend to leave a lot to be desired. I'm sorry to say that this one is no exception.\n\nThe biggest let down for me was the graphics, which could have been this game's redeeming feature. Had they been really good, or at least on par with Empire Total War Naval Battles, with similar camera controls, this could have been a neat, immersive tactical simulation. Unfortunately, its graphics look like they are based on the video card technology of 2003, and the camera controls are clunky.\n\nOn a more positive note, I found the physics simulation of the ships and ballistics to be spot on, but I do wonder if the realistically slow-paced nature of the game has been a problem for some players. Without immersive graphics to look at, it can become tiresome. I mean, these ships were beautiful!\n\nThis is definitely an improvement on the earlier series, and I hope the developer continues to improve the game. In particular I'd like to see much better camera controls in the next iteration. I'd also like to see some progress towards better graphics, and the addition of weather effects and crew morale to the game.\n\nI'm dismayed to see so many down voters for it here on Steam, as there are so few games of this genre available. This simulation this isn't at all bad. It's an indie game made in an almost dead genre and developers like these ought to be supported, in my opinion.","August 25, 2015","true","0.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Got  a bit bored and wandered of to make a cup of tea and get  a bite to eat and when I returned there were sinking and burning   Royal Navy ships everywhere...Now clearly my tactics of  leaving the ships be and wandering  off to  rustle up a feed and a cuppa is the best way to play this rather odd little game. As  a screen saver it does earn a thumbs up from me...","February 16","true","0.4"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","50","2","4","3","0"
