Yes, this game could've been deeper into the economics and route planning, the controls and menus could've been done better and there should've definitely been an order queue for multiple car and locomotive constructing, but eh, it's still a very cosy game to spend some of your time on.\n\nFor:\n+ pleasant graphics, music and atmosphere of the 19th century America,\n+ a campaign mode where you cross the country coast to coast developing your network,\n+ lots of locomotives and car types being gradually unlocked,\n+ ability to upgrade trains, depots, city districts, manufacturing companies and what not as the trade volume grows\n+ ability to rob and sabotage your opponents\n\nAgainst:\n- the menus and controls could've definitely been better\n- the limitation of train route length to 5 stations\n- certain technical problems (see below)\n\nIMPORTANT NOTICE: The optimization in this game kinda sucked a decade ago, making my PC lag when processing lots of trains in a widely developed railroad network by the middle of the campaign mode. I don't think this should be a problem with the modern PCs, but the code is kind of unstable as it is now: i myself cannot access savegame files as the application reacts with a crash to every attempt to load them.
