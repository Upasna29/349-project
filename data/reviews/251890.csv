What they promised years ago was to deliver a randomly generated, open world diving simulator with unparalleled realism, graphics, and gameplay.  What they have delivered over the past couple of years is a completely unstable, unplayable fantasy game with built-in monetization and in-game purchases, with small and broken maps.  Their screenshots DO NOT match the actual gameplay.  When the game used to work, it was a multiplayer gameplay clone of Depth Hunter 2: Deep Drive, a decent if barren clone.\n\nStarting in November 2014, World of Diving has become the culmination of false promises of progress, game-breaking bugs, eye-splitting visual glitches, dysfunctional online servers (used for authentication and multiplayer), a failed and forced migration to Unity 5, and a game with a backward-moving progress bar...all which make for a very angry user community.  But alas, you can help!  They request additional cash donations on their website in return for future updates.\n\nTo add insult to injury, updates are so broken, you are sometimes forced to redownload the previous (and still broken) version.  Each update is roughly 2GB in size.  Each is released with "new features" that no one asked for or wanted, and introduces new glitches while none of the on-going game-breaking bugs seem to get fixed.  There is something called Quality Assurance and Testing, which shouldn't be confused with a Beta Community. It's all very frustrating.\n\nSo this kind of business practice doesn't work for very long, and word has gotten out.  Now, this multiplayer game has literally nigh zero players, new or old ( http://steamcharts.com/app/251890#All ), the money stream has run dry, and Vertigo Games has already repurposed many of their developers to work on other projects.\n\nIn the summer of 2015, after years of retail availability as a playable and ever-improving Beta, Vertigo Games demoted World of Diving from Beta to Alpha on the Official World of Diving Website (with no communication about that on Steam).  It has become that broken now.\n\nAfter over a year on Steam, in an endless spiral of worse update after worse update, it's amazing that this kind of baitware can still be sold to new, unsuspecting consumers. How Vertigo Games goes about their business is atrocious and offencive, and they should all be very ashamed of taking advantage of their early adopters and taking thousands of dollars in "donations" for false deliverables, and finally, for providing such a HORRIBLE Early Access experience.\n\nSTAY AWAY FROM THIS GAME/DEVELOPER AND WARN YOUR FRIENDS.\n\n\nI ask that you please rate this up.","August 31, 2015","false","24.6"," 537 of 554 people (97%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","97","537","554","9","33"

There are now several types of challenges that renew each day as well as the addition of a metal detector that guides you to collectible coins which can be used to purchase various cosmetic additions like diving suites, watches, etc.\n\nThe daily challenges range from relaxing to frustrating. You’re told to take a picture of an object or group of fish and given some vague idea of where the thing is located. Some aren't timed which is nice, but the other side of that is the find a hidden object missions. In some cases I had to replay those missions over and over because I couldn't find a tea pot wedged in some obscure corner of the map (though you can kind of cheat if you know how).\n\nThe collectibles (which also include hidden pearls) and challenges give you a solid reason to explore every corner of each environment. There are even community missions and an editor to create your own.\n\nSo far this a great looking game that keeps getting better and better.\n\nOriginal review below.\n*****************************************\nI pre-ordered this from their website so my play time has been almost entirely outside of steam. Would I reccommend this? Yes. It's a work of passion that deserves the following it needs to bring to all of its ideas to life. That being said I would like to offer a word of caution only so that people know that they're buying into now and don't potentially complain in the reviews.\n\nIn it's current state there isn't much to do beyond dive in the available areas and simply explore. Each area has a wreck that you can swim around (or inside) and each map is reasonable big, but that's about it. There is a daily mini game you can play where you have to find an object within a time limit, but the game basically tells you where it is so it will last 2 minutes max. You can clip directly through fish and plants, and you can't manually change your orientation. So no swimming upside down.\n\nThere are microtransactions, but they're purely cosmetic and don't at all lock off any meaningful content.\n\nTo sum it up: In its current state it's more a virtual museum than anything.\n\nThat aside the game looks great. It has full controller support and the multiplayer works really well. I personally find it both thrilling and tense to swim around the detailed enviroments and you can even tread on the surface. You can also take pictures of anything you like and save them to your hardrive.\n\nThis is a very cool game and a work of love, but very much Early Access. Given time I have no doubt it will be amazing!\n\nP.S. Rift Supprt","July 18, 2014","true","11.4"," 146 of 174 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","146","174","0","10"

I usually wait a year to review early access games. Thats the amount of time I think is fair unless I find the actions of a developer particularly frustrating and/or disgusting.\n\nBack then Subnautica had so little content there wasn't even a save feature. This game had content, and I thoroughly enjoyed exploring the Bismarck, but there were a few areas that said "this area isnt available yet" because it was still in development.\n\nI didn't touch this game for nearly a year and just recently reinstalled it. Low and behold, there's nothing new besides a map with visual fidelity far, FAR worse than the others, and those undeveloped areas are still off limits.\n\nMeanwhile look at Subnautica. The amount of content added in just a year is staggering.\n\nAs far as I'm concerned this game is abandoned. I was able to ignore the always online, the microtransactions. The stupid XP system, and the lack of content because its early access. But it's been almost a year and there's basically nothing to show for it.\n\nI LOVE diving. I love the ocean. I love sailing. I love everything water themed. But this game is a pile of ♥♥♥♥.\n\nTo sum it all up:\n\nAlmost no noteable changes.\nPathetic options menu (you cant even turn off the in game music to play your own)\nYou can see everything there is to see in about 2-3 hours.\nYou can customize your character, but expect to either need to play the game every day and grind for dozens of hours, or purchase microtransactions.\nGraphics seemed to have downgraded since the last time I played.\nNothing to really do, levels are boring, tiny and incomplete, and missions are laughable.\n\nThe 30 or so minutes I played checking up on this game I spent wondering what could have been. The Bismarck alone could support a dozen hours of exploration, salvage and history. And it's really sad that this didnt get explored, and there seems to be no intention of it.\n\n\nIf you love the ocean and exploration as much as me then get Sunless Sea/Subnautica instead. Don't waste money on this.\n\nUPDATE 3/5/2016\nNo devblogs or update in months\nSeems they've finally stopped pretending. No new developer blogs of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ photoshop renders that will never be added.","October 9, 2015","false","5.8"," 78 of 87 people (90%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","90","78","87","2","3"

After playing 67.2 hours and following the game for 1.6 years I can say it’s nothing but a glitchy almost unplayable mess, that is assuming you can actually get into the broken game server. Features are being dropped left and right with updates containing little to no content other than cosmetic fluff for the microtransation store.  The game looks nothing like the trailers used to sell the game, from the world and all of its inhabitants being static, to the removal of game features that to this day are still advertised on the games main gallery.  The devs have been promising from the beginning that things will get better but they never do and when asked about it they either ignore and continue as they were or make some hollow apology and promise it will change.\n\nYour gameplay options are limited to exploring 8 small levels who aside from the river all look exactly the same except a central ship wreck which most remain unfinished. You can also take pictures and go on photo hunt which after the play though has already been mastered, the models appear in the same exact places…. And that’s it. The game was originally going to include a spear gun but was removed when a select few people on the forum whined that they didn’t like it, so the devs decided to silently remove it without a community vote and as mentioned previously is still used to this day to advertise the features of this game.\n\nThis game has nothing to show for its 2 years of development.  the devs too preoccupied with working on their other games when not just cramming more of the exact same cookie cutter content into “new” levels, 8 whole levels of the exact same models and gameplay with nothing new in sight for the foreseeable future as the recently posted road map for the game is just 8 months of bug fixes and art with no radical changes or updates to gameplay or the lack there of, oh and that they will start porting the game to Xbox in December.\n\nIt’s just a matter of time till the devs incompetence finally kills the project altogether.\n\nTLDR buy subnautica instead. And maybe come back in 3 years to see what progress the game has made. If it’s not dead by then.","August 19, 2015","false","68.4"," 60 of 64 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","60","64","0","0"

I found myself just wandering/swimming around the different levels just looking at the beautiful ocean life and ship wreaks. World of Diving is a great break from the usual fast-paced shooters, but it is not without faults. The in game “dive shop”, where you buy customizations, is filled with micro-transactions. Although you can unlock everything without buying it with real world money, the prices in the dive shop are very inflated. Along with the inflated prices, the updates are very slow coming. World of Diving also supports VR and player created content. (I’m waiting for steam workshop to be implemented) Even with the faults of this game, the multiplayer is a huge reason to buy this. It is tons of fun exploring the ocean with a few other friends.\n\nPros\nBeautiful graphics\nSeveral varied maps/locations\nEasy and fun multiplayer\nTons of customizations\nBeautiful and interactive ocean life\nPlenty to do\nVery relaxing\nVR support\n\n\n\n\nCons\nRequires secondary sign-in\nMicro-transactions\nVery slow movement\nSlow updates\nRepetitive “objectives”\n\n\nConclusion\nWorld of Diving is a beautiful and relaxing diving simulator, but it is not without faults. There is a few issues with buying customizations and as well as the fact of the updates are taking forever to come out. Even with the few issues (will most likely be fixed before release) the multiplayer is a huge asset for World of Diving. If you are looking for a relaxing game to play by yourself or with friends this is for you. Don’t expect anything fast paced and exciting.\n\nVideo Review\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1k1PsG8jJDg\n-HiPFiRED\n\n\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group\n\nCheck out the Original Network Groups.

I'd venture the same things as someone actually diving in a real reef - exploration, loads of aquatic wildlife, relaxation.\nWorld of Diving ignores all of this, instead presenting you with lots of cheap challenges (Race here, photograph three fish at once here).  There are hardly any fish and the environments are sparse.  To make matters worse, this paid game presents itself like a mobile phone freemium title, offering microtransactions for all sorts of (lets hope non essential) stuff.\nFor an example of how to do it right - look at Endless Ocean (Eternal Blue in the US) for the Wii.

They are too busy with their other cash grab projects. I sincerely wish I could get my money back for this lump of crap.\n\nI was looking for a good, down to the bolts diving simulator, and unfortunately, World of Diving is NOT the game I was looking for.\n\nSave your money and pass over this crap.

Graphically, it's quite beautiful.  The undersea world is rendered with appropriate murkiness; fish and dolphins flit about, sharks glide menacingly overhead, and shipwrecks look suitably weathered.\n\nBut that's about where it ends for me.  As nice as it looks, the ocean in World of Diving seems too static and artificial.  The fauna just swim about without much regard for the player.  The undersea wrecks are impressive, but non-interactive.  It looks real, but it doesn't feel real.\n\nIn fact, the only undersea interactivity is in the form of contrived "challenges" or hunting for coins or pearls.  Those elements don't really fit with the more realistic presentation.  It's like the developers are attempting to shoehorn a game into a simulation.  The result ends up jarring; I was simultaneously immersed in a wondrous environment and yet constantly reminded that I am playing a video game.\n\nMy recommendation would be to allow an option to ditch the more obvious "game" like elements in favor of a more immersive experience with better interaction with the undersea world.\n\n\nUpdated August 15/2015:\n\nSince my original review, I've been following the game's development hoping it would get better with time.  Unfortunately, it hasn't.\n\nA few months back the developers migrated from Unity 4 to Unity 5.  The upgrade took several months and introduced a host of bugs and graphical issues with it.  Despite the engine upgrade, the game feels like it's taken a step back particularly with the water graphics.\n\nThe game's popularity has also dwindled, with typically no more than a couple people playing at any given time.  For a game that boasts multiplayer, not having any players renders that feature moot.  Add on periodic server connection issues and you have a situation that doesn't seem too optimistic.\n\nThe developers also revealed a roadmap of future game features, but other than improved fish AI, there isn't much to get excited about on that list.  Anyone looking for a more hardcore diving simulator is going to walk away disappointed.\n\nThis game is simply not worth the money and the way it is being developed, probably won't ever be.  Pick up Subnautica instead.  It's a much better underwater game.","March 24, 2015","false","6.7"," 33 of 39 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","33","39","0","0"

Really hard to say as this title is so very different. If you want some underwater action or competition or a challenge then this is as wrong as a game could be.\nIf you like a total relaxing chill from time to time without the slightest pressure at all, or simply like diving (although this is by no means a diving-simulator!), this one could be of your taste.\n\n\nCan you even call "World of Diving" a "game"? There is no real goal, no enemies, no story, no threat, not even the fear of running out of oxygen and no deeper meaning at all.\n\nYou just go, well, diving and do, well, diver-stuff.\nFor that you have some tools at your disposal like the Metal-Detector (for finding gold), the camera for taking photos (you don't say!), the diver propulsion vehicle (DPV) for getting around faster.\nOn each map (there are around 9 at the time of writing) you can do some missions or even "challenges" (some with, some without a timelimit) for which you'll get some gold. These missions consist of stuff like "photograph these 3 fishes" and the likes.\nAlso there is a mission-editor which lets you create your own stuff, and on each map you could do missions others have created.\n\nWhat is the purpose of all this you may ask? Consider this game a total relaxing chilling "game". You don't have to race time, there is nothing to win, you can't even fight anything and nothing will hurt you either.\nAnd you can even do this online with others (there is no chat, you'll have to communicate with handsigns. Nice idea). But to keep you mildly motivated to relax even more, there is a progression. You will get XP for missions\nwhich will "level" your character. The higher you'll get, the more stuff to equip your character will be unlocked. Among those are e.g. cute companions like a clownfish or even a shark.\n\nBut there is a dark side too. An itemshop. Yes. An itemshop for a totally non-competitive game :-)\nRight now these items are all of cosmetic nature and you could get the bought items by collecting too (which of course will take much more time). Still it leaves a bitter taste for the critical customer.\n\nOne thing to really judge in this title are the graphics: Really fitting, nothing next-gen but still beautiful. Yet quite demanding. With my rig (see profile) i won't get higher than 30-60fps on Ultra with FullHD.\nBut OK, it's early access, and if you're fine with lower fps that is totally acceptable for a title like this.\n\nBTW it supports Occulus Rift, but no 3D-Vision yet (DarkStarSword, the holy knight of 3D-Vision-fixing is working on a fix though).","November 5, 2014","true","4.6"," 32 of 38 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","32","38","0","2"

It's really zen and relaxing. You just swim around and look around. So if something like that doesn't sound interesting, you probably wouldn't like it. There are a few maps to explore right now, but supposedly someday it will be open world. Overall, there isn't a TON of content, but it is in Early Access. For the price, as long as they deliver on their promises, it's definitely worth it and then some.\n\nI experienced one crash while playing, but I think it had to do with the server, as the person I was playing with crashed at the same moment I did.  But besides that, it's very responsive, no lagging of the other players.  And I rather like that the other way you can communicate with the other players is through hand motions.\n\nWorks great with a controller. Movement is fluid and natural, I didn't need to look at the controls to figure out what to do almost immediately.","August 28, 2014","true","5.4"," 24 of 30 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","24","30","0","2"

There are many pretty cosmetic enhancements that you can buy even without mini-transactions, by collecting pearls and dubloons yourself. Missions can be made by community, just like maps in workshop.

It took me awhile to get around to trying it and after starting it up... no tutorial. Okay, click on some things and read what button does what, would rather a box popped up and actually told me what I was supposed to do, but we can just wander randomly and see what happens. I'm smart, I finally figured it out after restarting the mission part three times. I got through the first few photo missions, until I had to swim into a tube (claustrophobic anyone?) and had one minute to locate 5 starfish and photograph each one of them. Um... maybe if you had 1 minute per starfish, but after at least a dozen tries I wanted to beat my controller against my laptop, but decided it wasn't worth it and just shut it off. The graphics were really nice, although I expected them to be a lot more realistic than they were, a little boxy. No tutorials, controls are clunky and horrific, in my opinion, but I'm not used to these type of games so maybe it's me. I would say "mission impossible" and "clueless" were good terms for this game so far. It's a great concept, but falls flat on execution. I hope it does evolve into something better, because I was really intrigued by it, which is why I bough it in the first place. However, right now, can't recommend it. I’ll probably go back and try the multiplayer mode someday when I’m really mind-numbingly bored and swim around, but I’m steering clear of the other parts of the game.","August 29, 2015","false","1.4"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","0"

I've played eDiving (simulator), Infinite Scuba and WoD (the three diving games I know of as currently supported) and without a doubt WoD is the most polished and has the most potential to continue to be the best available.\n\nThe new mission creator is cool, and integrates pretty well into the way the game maps work. The wrecks are intriguing and well laid out, the aquatic life is interesting and the new schooling behaviors are great.\n\nThe game is still early release, and as such features, maps, and even bugs (to be expected) are rolling out on continual basis, but the developers keep a weather eye on the forums and user communications and do a pretty darn good job of addressing everything as it comes and goes.\n\nThe graphics are decent, but could use some frame rate optimization which the developers have acknowledged and are working on currently.\n\nThere's definately a few things I'd like to see added/changes (and you can read posts from myself and many others on the official forums), but the developers are doing a great job of communicating their plans and taking our user advice.\n\nIf you're a diver, a fan of games like Endless Ocean, or just the "explorer" type, definately take a moment to look at this game and hopefully you'll join our network of divers in game.","August 28, 2014","true","47.8"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","12","15","0","0"

Here I am going to tell you the pros, cons, and things that I think you should add to make the game even better!!\n\nPros:\n\n~The graphics are amazing, and the water is a real amount of murky when it needs to be.\n~The camera feature is amazing, and the pictures that are taken are breath taking.\n~The camera feature allows you to take a "selfie" with the wreck or something.\n~The looks of the sharks, dolphins, and fish are beautiful!\n~The wrecks of the ships look so realistic!\n~The custimazation is plentiful.\n~The buddy thing is adorable, and I can't wait to get enough to buy one.\n~The hand signals are super accurate.\n\nCons:\n\n~A bit laggy at some points, mainly with the multiplayer.\n~Requires a secondary login, which some people hate. (I was okay with it, and I think it was totally worth it)\n~Whilst it is meant to be a relaxing game, the murky waters can make it a little scary for more anxious people.\n\nAdvice to make the game better:\n\n~Whilst it may be meant to be a relaxing game, i think it would be better to add more territorial and vicious creatures.\n~Caves that you could swim in and find money would be cool.\n~A selling feature so that you could sell your pearls and other stuff.\n~Collectable items that you could collect, sell, and get information on.\n~A book that you can access while playing in the menu or something to give you information on the wreck and the creatures you can find.\n~Being able to walk on the beaches and set up a camp.\n~To go along with the above feature, there should be a fishing feature to let you spear fish and stuff to get and cook food just for fun.\n\nThat's all for me, and I hope that this helped you if you were considering to buy it.

I like the fact that you can drop your camera, swim in front of it, and remotely take your picture.  The planned features, like metal detectors, fish interaction, mission creation to share with the community, and advanced cameras look promising.  I'm glad that a ridable underwater jet is available so that you can move around more quickly (hold in space to bring up a radial menu).  Coupled with the GPS (tab), it makes swimming from one location to another very easy.

The game's animation is not bad, kinda original, the game can be glitched in quite easily done ways, and the story, quests, and overall idea is played out pretty fast, easily boring. There is no actual story in my opinion, while the quests are great, they're just repeating sometimes, for example: You must take pictuers of certain animals, which is done multiple times and is boring to a high extent, thus making it less fun. When it comes to the animals and seas to explore, the animals are good, just not that many, out of the infinite amount of life, they choose such original and normal animals, making it less creative. The seas are animated and detailed well, just they are plain other than the animals and occasional ships and wrecks you find. In my opinion, this is one of the more glitchy ocean exploring games I have seen, you can glitch into stuff, and many things don't work, atleast the way you want them to. Last is, this game is confusing, in the beginning I had no idea what was going on, no idea what to do, how to build tubes, the main place you spawn is just confusing, it needs better explaining, it's just a slightly modified version of a lot of ocean dive games, DEPTH, Subnautica, etc.","March 3","false","0.4"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","12","16","0","0"

I'd like to be able to turn to face the ships orientation and drag myself along certain objects and the lack of this makes that freedom of being underwater further away from how you actually feel in the game.\n\nThe most frustrating part for me is that I see this as an MMO, not the usual MMO though, it's a Massively Missed Oportunity. If you've ever watched the TV show 'Tanked' you'll likely know what I'm getting at here. The living eco system in our seas is sorely missing from this game. The graphics are more in line with those aquariums in the show where the customer doesn't have enough time or knowledge to be able to look after a 'real life' aquarium with living rock and coral being substituted with acrylic, silicone, rubber, painted pieces that are too bright and unnatural.\n\nThis may be ok for some but for me I'd like to see something closer to a real life reef than the artificial reefs that are used in that show. This day and age I think the devs could aim higher with transparency brought into the fray and annemonies and corals showing some real colours and movement, not these bright pink and blue stuck on cheapo immitations.\n\nUnder water there's a lack of distance viewing which should have been an opportunity to really cram the details into the surrounding area of your swimming zone. I can't help but feel that the Unity 5 engine may be partially to blame for the lack of this. But I live in hope that the life that is sorely missing for me will be gradually introduced over time with this being still an early access release.\n\nFrom a lifelong marine tank enthusiasts perspective I can't help feeling really disappointed with the lack of realism but at the same time I do enjoy the game, so I have to give it the recommendation for that reason alone. I hope that over time the realism will be introduced to bring us a game that really uses current pc capabilities.","January 23, 2015","true","6.2"," 13 of 18 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","13","18","0","0"

Unfortunately in it's current state idea is the only thing it has.\n\nBiggest issue is that there has been very little progress since i bought this game a year ago. Wreck of Bismarck is a key selling point for this game. What happens when you try to dive under deck? "This area is not available yet". Some oysters you can open and find pearls inside, others just say "This oyster requires a tool to open (coming soon)". These two things you will see just after five minutes of gameplay and it has been like this for a year. So what has changed during the year? Framerate is much better than what it was a while ago. There are new diving suits. Also there is one new map which is different from the rest in it's setting and is kind of interesting.\n\nGraphics are just not good enough for this kind of game. This game needs a lot of work with light and shadow for it to have any kind of mood or atmosphere. For example your flashlight only lights but doesn't create shadows. Also, darkness really isn't dark: You will have no problems seeing inside a shipwreck with no natural light or flashlight. Those places should be pitch black! Movement does not kick up dust or anything like that, which would also be nice. Atleast in it's current state it runs well.\n\nThe maps are quite boring aswell. For example you can dive inside some shipwrecks and in it are okay looking walls and maybe something like a torpedo bay but all the little things are missing. This means all signs that someone has lived there: No tools, no tin cans, no bottles, no cutlery, no clothes, nothing. The places are just empty shells. Real joy of i guess diving but atleast exploring lost places is the little stories that your mind creates from all of the items and their relations to places. Nothing like that is in this game. This also makes the photography part of the game meaningless since you can't create stories with it either.\n\nOptions for graphics and such are just not there either. Can you adjust brightness? No. Can you adjust sound levels? No. Can you change key bindings? No.\n\nAt the time of this review World of Diving is still very much a work in progress with little signs of progress. If you are interested, wait. Do not buy yet. If you just have to play a diving game, click the "More like this" button insted of "Add to cart".\n\nIf you are still not sure then check the forums here and on the official website.

With a strong community to match, this game will force the genre to step up its game to match.\n\nWorld of Diving is currently in Alpha so my review may change. This game not only involves the simulation itself but also a vibrant online community and forum structure. The forums are filled with experienced real world divers, hardcore gamers, glitch finders, and people who simply wish they could dive in real life. But the one thing they all share is a desire to assist the developers Vertigo Games - create one of the best looking and best playing dive simulations on the market.\n\nAs far as the game itself - it already looks beautiful even without any sort of optimization. This facet can only get better with the addition of a day/night cycle and environmental effects. However, as a person who has grown up on the beaches in South Florida, I can tell you one thing... they have captured the lifestyle perfectly so far. Water effects like ripple and water light diffusion are spot on. And diving to a deep wreck already conjures up a feeling of excitement as you get closer and closer, and it finally comes into view.\n\nWrecks themselves have very early versions of their final textures - the last major update changed them dramatically from before. Yet they do have some weight to them - it feels like the objects have been underwater for some time.\n\nFish interaction is nearly nonexistent - however, there are flashes of greatness - Dolphins playing and following divers to a wreck - Fish scattering if a shark swims into their school - Some fish not being overly concerned about the presence of a diver and others seeking safer places if you even look at them wrong.\n\nOverall, it is a promising alpha - and I encourage all fans of diving to join us in the World of Diving.","September 1, 2014","true","29.5"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","2"

The more time you spend, the more you will find.  Use your loot to purchase new apparel and equipment.  If you want an amazing visual experience, this game will provide.  I only wish I could go diving/snorkling like this for real.","January 1, 2015","true","3.6"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

Sadly also very boring after a while.\n\nYou cant die or get injured, theres no pressure or stress in any Form (besides some easy Timelimits at the Challenges.) you cant hunt or kill fish, you cant run out of Oxygen.\n\nYou can swim and dive around, do Challenges, take Pictures with your Camera, collect Pearls and Doubloons which you need to unlock some extra Character Customization, or just enjoy watching at some well animated Sealife.\n\nWorld of Diving is a Casual Game, not a Diving Simulator\n\nPositive:  + The Controls are easy to understand and use.\n+ You can customize your Character\n+ Mission Editor with some hilarious options.\n+ No Violence, so the Game is also good for younger Children.\n+ Oculus Rift Support\n\n~ Graphics and Lighteffects are okay. But not really impressive.\n~ The Playtime value is about 5 Hours. Then you should have seen everything.\nAfter that you only play for Achievements, do repetitive "swim there, take Pictures"-Challenges and then you might keep playing in the hope for new features.\n\nNegative:	 -The Game could need some more different Species, like Crabs, Lobsters, Sea urchinJellyfish,... or in general a higher population, cause some Areas of the Game feel like a "Death Zone",  theres nothing to see besides Sand, Rocks, Plants, Corals and Anemones.   - The Game is in Early Access, so theres Hope to see some things in the Future. -\n- There is a Multiplayer Mode, but for now i havent seen many other People.\n- You can communicate only via Handsigns. NO IN GAME CHAT...\n- There is a Brony Ship in the Game. Yeah you heard me right.\n- Another big issue of the Game is the Price. You pay 19,99€ for an Indie Game that still has a form of Moneytization inside. Even if its just for cosmetic Items, this system just avoids having a larger Playerbase, and kills the Game.\n- When the Servers are down, you cant even play the Singleplayer Mode\n\nSo far i havent seen any Bugs (besides some video/texture glitches), the ability to "swim" on Land seems to be an Easteregg. )\n\nI got nothing really negative to say about this Game at the Moment, besides the mentioned Points that need to be worked on . (Add more Sealife, Text or Audiochat...)\n\nWell, i changed my mind about that.\nthe actually Playerbase consists of about 10 active players and its really boring to have a Multiplayer game without a voice or text chat.\nI hate to say it so honest, i had a blast with this Game while i had hope that there will be more Players more Features, but now im afraid that this Project is almost Dead.\nSo ichanged my Review from positive to negative.  [/b]\nUnless there will be large changes like the removal of the dumb Moneytization which scares away most customers, and adding an additional in Game chat,  i can not recommend this Game for 19,99€","October 11, 2014","false","50.2"," 20 of 34 people (59%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","59","20","34","2","1"

With the new update you get Oculus Rift support as well. So far missions include taking 'selfies' & snapshots of items of interest & treasure hunting for dubloons & pearls with your cool new metal detector. There are some new areas to explore as well like the shipwreck of the renowned WWII german battleship 'Bismarck'.\nThe game has a great character customization UI with some really cool looking equipment and skins. It's developers are very interactive with the community & there are some very cool community based missions already included & playable. Multiplayer is also a treat with a variety of underwater hand gestures to communicate with. I'd like to see more points earned for multiplayer co-op based missions. I would also like the idea of having to check & refill your limited oxygen tanks in real-time. Oh well, I guess I'll have to visit the game's forum & post my ideas.\nSpeaking of forums, their forum is point based so more interaction & mission completion earns you more diving points although I still haven't found out what the point system earns you yet.

This game is a fulfillment of that kind of promise personal computers had. My memory isn't perfect, but if I didn't hear someone longingly talk of someday being able to "explore underwater worlds" once, then it's only because I heard it more than once. And here we are; the future has become the present.\n\nI love aquatic biomes and the ability to visit one so detailed as this when I'm unable to do so in real life is something I adore having. The diversity of life you find in the waters of World of Diving necessarily doesn't equal what you'd see in an actual ocean, but there is enough variety that it stays interesting. As far as the fish go, they're so impressively detailed that you can easily tell their species at a glance if you know them in real life. And their behavior seems to differ slightly by species, as well.\n\nThe sunken ships and the like are interesting and seem to be very well done. Those aren't as interesting to me as natural formations and flora and fauna, so I can't say much more than that about them. Well, I do remember that as I went through one sunken ship looking for Jack-o-Lanterns around Halloween, I remarked that the ship itself was a horror movie waiting to happen. Spooky. These sunken ships (and one plane, I believe) are often the hub or target of some of the available missions.\n\nThis is such a beautiful experience and if you came looking at it with any hint of interest in the first place, you couldn't go wrong with it.","January 3, 2015","true","12.0"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

There are various dive sites with plenty of vibrant wildlife and plants. The main focus of each area are shipwrecks. While fun to explore, the wrecks themselves feel small and don't take a while to explore. While being very fleshed out, the dive sites also feel a little small, but this is still early in development. For an early-access game, I came across very, very few bugs. The mission editor is also fun to tinker with and easily lets you fully realize amazing coral reefs. It was also clear to me that the developers are working very hard to improve the game with polls on loading screens allowing you to vote for what content should be added.\n\nThe core gameplay is simply diving. There are also missions which have you take certain pictures within an allotted amount of time. However, I didn't really come for the missions, they served as fun, little minigames that I did once in a while. The game is very set on experiencing things with a community, and in-game you could make all basic diving gestures.\n\nThe game does get a little boring sometimes, but I enjoy coming back every so often to explore and look for things that I've mixed. There are in-game currencies, doubloons, and paid-for currencies, pearls, that allow you to get certain gear and even diving buddies. However, these are purely cosmetic.\n\nOverall, World of Diving is a fun, interesting game that I look forward to coming back to in the future. I can't wait to see how the game turns out from here and expect nothing but the best. This game has a lot of potential and Oculus Rift support makes the game a must-buy title for Rift users. Diving alone or with friends is a calming experience that is very refreshing coming off of the violence of most video games. This is a game for people who enjoy diving or nature, or are just looking for a cool, little sidegame with no real story elements that they can just pick-up and play without worrying about story elements or character progression.\n\nSCORE: 7.5/10\n","February 15, 2015","true","6.6"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","9","14","0","0"

Development on WoD has been painfully slow since I got this game a few months ago with very little actually being added to the game. The most recent update broke the game so the devs reverted back to an older update which is also broken. Despite my playtime and my original review the game is incredibly boring and bland, perhaps looking at it in hindsight is what has made me change my mind but there's very little to do apart from swim around and take Screenshots and the different maps don't really change anything. Furthermore there's very little communication from the devs apart from, and I'm paraphrasing here, "we're a very small team and most of our studio is focused on three other projects so it's hard for us to get things done" which you can see for yourself on one of the Steam forum discussions about this game being dead.\n\nOn top of all this the game is now riddled with bugs and issues, many of which are game breaking for people trying to play it. None of the updates the devs are working on address any of these issues and each update seems to bring more and more issues to the game.\n\nWoD is a great example of Early Access done wrong and you should steer clear of this title until development picks up and interesting content is actually present in the game.\n\nOriginal Review: World of Diving is a diving simulator game that is currently available through Steam Early Access. In World of Diving you take to the water at a number of different locations ranging from a diving school (and the surrounding waters) to a sunken WWII ship. World of Diving has both multiplayer and singleplayer but due to the lack of players I've only experienced the singleplayer.\n\nThis game does include microtransactions but everything in the game's store can be purchased with in-game money (if you can be bothered to collect the stupid amounts necessary).\n\n+Great graphics\n+Extremely relaxing to play\n+A number of different dive tools to help you out\n+Community challenges are well intergrated into each map\n+A reasonable amount of maps at the moment\n+There are some really cool cosmetic items in the shop if you like that kind of thing\n+Wildlife is well designed and they seem to behave quite realistically\n+Easy to use mission editor\n\n+/-Sea predators, such as sharks, pose no threat to you. It benefits how relaxing the game is but it does take away from the realism\n+/-Apart from some pretty unimaginative challenges which have you take pictures of things there's not much to do which is fine if you just want to have a relaxing experience but makes the game get boring quite quickly\n\n-Progress on this game is painfully slow, the devs do release weekly devblogs (which just show how little they get done each week) but it has been a very long time since the game actually got an update\n-Itemshop prices (whether you're using real currency or in-game currency) are way too high\n-Currently oxygen needs aren't in the game so you don't have to worry about your oxygen levels, takes away from the game's realism\n-The game has a 'brony' level. Whether you are a fan of bronies or not this map really breaks the realism of the game as of course you wouldn't find such a thing in the real world\n-The maps are very small and the wrecks within the maps also feel a bit too small\n\nVerdict:\n6\n\nA nice diving game with great visuals that is let down by painfully slow updates and its lack of realism, I'd suggest buying this on sale and playing with friends.\n\nEl K.","March 14, 2015","false","5.1"," 11 of 19 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","11","19","0","2"

So, I saw this game and it looked just what I wanted, so I bought it.\n\nBad idea.\n\nWhy? Because this game is still rated as "Early Access", but not only has there been NO update in the months I've owned it, the game has also been out for almost TWO YEARS!!!! Two years in early access! That says everything about it's state and fate and I seriously regret I didn't get myself more informed about it before wasting my money.\n\nNot only is the game early access, but also feels like it. Very little content, enough bugs and sadly most of the players have left, so you're usually diving alone or, if you're lucky, with another player.\n\nThere is no reason to believe this game will be ever continued, much less finished, so save your money and go buy something else. Subnautica looks promising, though is also early access so can be another trap, or if you don't mind old graphics, campy dialogue and plot and worse music, but want scuba-diving as realistic as it is possible on a PC, try to find Diver: Deep Water Adventures.

In its current state, it’s quite clearly early access, missing a large portion of content and functions, although what is there is looking relatively promising.\n\nOverall it’s hard for me to really recommend World of Diving as it currently stands. Although I rather enjoyed my time with the game, I honestly don’t feel that in its current state that it’s justifiable as a purchase. Perhaps once some more polishing up of the optimisation and addition of more mechanics, I could have a much easier time giving it a recommendation. However, I would certainly keep it on your watch-list if the idea of an interactive diving exhibition interests you, because it certainly has some potential, it just has a little way to go yet.\n\nFor some extra info, there is a video preview below:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04DCBH4xwkA","September 18, 2014","true","2.4"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

The dev team tried to rush things because of that and the result was catastrophic. They came with a half finished adaptation of their game on the new game engine they worked on. Half demonstration, half game. It was a fail. Now they work on their own pace and build up the game again and the half game is becoming a whole game again, slowly.\nIndeed this project will not be finished in 2015. They have a todo list untill may 2016 at least.\n\nSo : I strongnly advise NOT to buy this game now if you want a finished game. It is permanently changing and you will always be disappointed. The project is great and a lot of ideas already came through, but a lot didn't, some has been cancelled, or at least frozen. Other has been worked hard and are almost finished and results can already be seen.\n\nAnyhow, buy this game in early access only if you have strong backbone and wishes to see a game in developpement with a lot of broken features. Wait for the final release if you wish a brand new polished game : the dev team showed they were able to create a fine working game... They could, so they still can.\n\nBut be honest with yourself before you buy it. This game is not expensive : $20 at the moment I am writing this review. You'll pay more for less, but you'll pay less for more too.\n\n\nIf you wish to spend a little time with people wishing to go forward : dive in. Water is hot and fishes are colorful.\nIf you wish to play a game of the same quality and professionalism than call of duty... Just walk out. It will never be that great. The dev team is a small dev team with humble capacities... But they have a strong resolution and no hidden agenda...\n\nThat's more than a lot of greenlight games but that's less than all AAA game.\nThis game is not Metal Gear. This game is not Mass Effect. This game is not Subnautica.\n\nBut this game is a project that will go through. There is no doubt about that.\n\nWhether you will be amongst us or not is up to you.\n\nI RECOMAND this game but not to everyone. If you don't have an experimental brain, forget it and come back next year.","August 17, 2015","true","100.0"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

If you were expecting anything along the lines of Far Sky or an action-style type of game, then you will be dissappointed, as World of Diving is literally an underwater exploration game.  And it's pretty good for what it is.\n\nWorld of Diving's gameplay is very limited.  You can explore the sea, explore the wrecks of ships, and take pictures.  It is very little to work with, but the game is a state of Early Access, and for the most part, these activities are actually more fun than they sound.  You can explore the sea for treasure to unlock new gear (which is only aesthetic), explore wrecks with a group of people, which is really fun since the wrecks are designed in a nice way, and picture taking is picture taking, though there are challenges, which are nice and spice up the gameplay.\n\nIn terms of movement, movement feels very fluid, and feels pretty realistic, it actually makes you feel like your swimming, and it's cool.\n\nIn terms of sounds, the game has a very ambient sound design, there isn't music, there are only the sounds of the ocean.  It's very immersive, though it would be cool to see an addition like an MP3 player.\n\nIn the graphics department, World of Diving shines.  Everything graphically is pretty beautiful, with the exception of some character animations and dolphin animations.  Besides that, the visuals lock in the feel of realism that the game creates so well in every department.  The  flashlight is also very good, the lighting visuals are superb.\n\nOverall, it is obvious that the devs have a serious passion for what they are creating, and while it is a bit lackluster at the moment, it is still very fun.  If you have ever wanted to explore the ocean without getting wet, World of Diving is the best choice for that experience.","September 7, 2014","true","5.9"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/pell_mel/recommended/251890/","pell_mel","pell_mel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/pell_mel/","51 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nA couple years ago, I had the fortune to spend a week at a tropical resort with a little fish-filled cove attached to it. I spent every spare moment with my little waterproof camera snapping pictures of all the amazing life under the water, and then I spent days at home happily going through and saving all the photos that turned out, on my computer.\n\nThat's what this game is, but in larger locales that often include wrecks to explore.\n\nIf this appeals to you, you'll love it. If it doesn't, move along.\n\nNo, you can't harpoon whales, wrestle sharks or lasergun aliens. It's fish. And plants. And water. And a camera. Which, if you are not completely warped by the idea that you have to be "winning" something in a game, can be incredibly engaging.\n\nPlay using audio headphones if you don't have a VR headset yet - it will vastly increase your immersion*. I'll be buying the Oculus Rift for this game.\n\n*pun intended.\n\nEdit: One more thing that will be helpful if you're on the fence. I find that you need an exceptionally good machine to run this game. My little integrated-graphics laptop cannot do it, and it wasn't until very recently that I got it back up and running on my older gen quad core desktop with a 1 GB graphics card. I can run most MMOs I've tried pretty close to max graphics settings, but in this game, have had a lot of lag around the diving base, and it keeps forcing me to lowest, or second-lowest, settings. I love that the graphics have been upgraded since the pre-Steam days when I played regularly, but I do wish there was the ability to turn it down to the graphics levels they had available before.\n\nBut hey, it's early access, and a lot can happen before Oculus finally releases their consumer headset, right? I do hope Vertigo keeps in mind that a casual sort of game like this needs to be accessible across a wide range of rigs though. A lot of amazing games have shot themselves in the foot by putting visual quality before accessibility.","October 25, 2015","true","4.9"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","3","7","0","0"
