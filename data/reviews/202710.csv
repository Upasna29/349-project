Demigod popped on my radar a few years back but when it launched there were several server issues that hindered the initial launch. I still praise this game because when the dust settled and the mud slinging stopped it turned out to be a pretty little gem.\n\nDemigod borrows interesting ideas from RTS games and implements that into MOBA gameplay. Capturing points, upgrading troops, towers and buildings are just a few of these mechanics and I welcome them as a different way of looking at how  MOBA games could add layers of gameplay. Unfortunately there was nothing else added to the game with the exception of two extra demigods. Each demigod is unique and you still level up, gain gold, upgrade skills and buy items.\n\nI've had some incredible matches on Demigod when the community remained active and it is something I always go back to with a few friends for bot matches. The AI matches can get incredibly hectic on the higher difficulties with Demigod offering a variety of maps. You can pick up Demigod now for $10 but I've seen it for around $5 on the sales.\n","January 31, 2014","true","17.6"," 54 of 63 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","54","63","0","2"

All around a well polished game with great graphics and soundtrack. For instance, the opening movie sequence was voiced by the actor, Christopher Lee, known for his roles as Dracula and the evil wizard, Sauron, in Lord of the Rings.\n\nThe initial learning curve is a little steep without strong tutorial missions, but persistent players will be rewarded with hours of fun. I recommend playing against the computer bots on easy mode, and if possible, get a friend to play co-op with you against the bots. You won't be disappointed.\n\nDemigod is something of a sleeper hit that may have been overshadowed by the likes of League of Legends (LOL) and Defense of the Ancients (DOTA 1 and DOTA 2).

It has a slow, deliberate gameplay where you always have the option of running away, but seldom do. This often gives the feeling of tactics more than a click-fest. You could have given up the defense and backed off, but you took a stand and won (or died heroically).\nThere are only 10 heroes, but it is impossible to buy all abilities of a demigod during one match. The item list is a bit short, split between equipment (~6x6 low to medium-powered  items) and artifacts (~12 late-stage heavy hitters). The heroes are all rendered as high-quality models, and the maps are plentiful. Add in the 4 different victory conditions and matches can be very different.\nI like the feeling of control and the well thought-out hero concepts.

The graphics are nice, the characters are diverse and each one plays differently.\nMy favorite thing are the levels.\nThey are all very different. Instead of the same map with the same things just moved around in different spots, each arena is a new setting, the layout is different along with the placement of the various buildings, flags, and portals, and the ambient surroundings are somethign as well.

Beautiful graphics that still surpass any other MOBA out. Nice sound track and great sound effects. With a surround system the battles pound.(When Rook starts swinging his hammer, you feel it.) Not to mention, Christopher Lee as the narrator!\n\nThere is a small (and seemingly growing} group of players on this one. Join the community forums to find players that really enjoy it. Also there is a mod pack that absolutely crucial for this game, again see the steam community forums for details of where to get it. (http://forums.demigodthegame.com/412017)\n\nI have had this one for a while and I love that it came out in 2009 and I am still having so much fun with it. With the mod pack(which fixes some AI issues) the game provides an amazing single player experience and with a full roster in multiplayer the game owns. Inspite of Dota's massively superior numbers and the full weight of Valve's marketing, Demigod eats Dota's lunch. (Also, please not that I bought the Box version on release- then got the Steam version when it became available.  Only mention it because the Steam hours played listed are not accurate of my play time with this one.)\n\nBe advised though, you should consider this as a "Single Player" purchase.

Get this.\n\n\nLong-ish textwally version: This game was the BEST way back in the day when there was a somewhat lively community, it's died down quite a lot since, but still decent. The gameplay was, and to me, still is, slightly is ahead of the MOBA curve in it's own way, such as being able to upgrade your main citadel to buff your creep waves and the like.  Now due to it's age, theres many a bug, my personal favorite being random times where your character won't bloody move when told, but that's pretty minor and rare.\nAnother thing I love is the fact that, while certain God's are more suited to certain roles, there is no "Best" build for every situation for a given character. Speaking of God's, quite a bit of diversity, you've got anywhere from the fragile archer angel, Regulus, to the literal walking castle Rook. The gods are split into two types: Assassins and General's, Assassins just worry about themselves, whereas General are capable of summoning various creatures, either through abilities or items.\nWhile there are admittedly only 10 gods, and all there ever will be as far as we can tell, well, outside of mods of course, but they all have a huge amount of thought and love put into their designs and back story.\nThere are about 8 maps, and 4 modes, so it may repeat a bit...

I know that there are newer, updated games out there, and I know it had a rough start, but it's one of those simple games you can keep going back to with your friends or do some tournaments on your own and pretend that you have friends.

As you kill enemies and do battle you earn currency and experience allowing you to level your demigod up through a branching skill-tree as well as purchase a variety of upgrades at your homebase, anything from stat boosting wearables to potions and massive faction boosts are available. At the end of a match all is reset and you get to do it all over again against a new foe or controlling a new hero.\n\nDemigod makes a number of rookie mistakes however. The lack of any sort of tutorial makes the game difficult to learn and the single-player matches against the AI does in no way prepare you for the multi-player. As a heavily team dependent game it is quite possible for a single inexperienced player to lose the match regardless of his teammates leading to a generally hostile community.\n\nThe greatest mistake Demigod makes however, is in the multi-player. Connection issues plague every matchup and it requires an enormous amount of patience to play a full game. For a game that is so heavily multi-player based this should be a complete deal breaker for any potential buyers.\n\nThe game is fairly good looking and the sound and music is pleasant enough creating an enjoyable atmosphere.\n\nAll in all Demigod is a decent MOBA that provides you with a unique set of Generals and Assassins to control and has all the makings of an enjoyable game. The lack of single-player components and the massive connection issues makes me unable to recommend this to anyone however as even the most avid MOBA aficionado will be hard pressed to enjoy a game he cannot play.","June 18, 2013","false","44.3"," 37 of 60 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","37","60","0","0"

You're right, it is pretty dynamic, not as challenging to pick up as Dota, and gives you some basic flexibility with your auto-throwaway units, which you can upgrade (along with towers) at your citadel. Despite there being only ten heroes, there's more gameplay options with the "generals" (spawn your own minions) or "assassin" (nuker) hero class categories.\n\n*sighs*\n\nThat said, the game received no patches or additional content post-release. Even at release, there were very, very few maps with no tutorial or story campaign. So, basically, you jump right in with NPC fights or buggy, laggy online games (which, as you might imagine, do not exist) with the same limited map pool. While the game had the capacity for mod content, it's not like the Steak Workshop or Creator Kit was around when this came out, so there is no amateur content either to be found either unless you want some very basic UI tweaks.\n\nI think, probably, the most aggravating part of this game is that what few maps there are don't really allow for progress like Dota does with one map. It's like Unreal Tournament (2004), if you create a game with just AI players, you can stay at your base for five hours if you wanted to, come back, everything is exactly how it was when you left it. Heroes do not have as significant presence/impact without reaching the maximum level. The gameplay is just...bland. There's no hiding, very limited potential for ganking, no terrain advantages/disadvantages, hidden items...No meaningful progress happens on the map without steamrolling with sheer numbers and, even then, that progress is easily reversed back to a stalemate automatically by creeps in no time flat. Die, kill me, anything. Games HAVE to end at some point.\n\nWhereas some really good older titles were given new patches and content by their publishers  to bring them back to being contenders with Steam re-releases, this was an already mediocre game that did not get that attention.\n\nThis is just the absolute embodiment of lost potential.\n","December 23, 2014","false","6.2"," 51 of 87 people (59%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","59","51","87","2","0"

Also a few years back (around it's release) pirates hacked the server service for the game, stardock, said pirates had acess to all the user's information, some of which includes credit card data.  Gas powered and Stardock didn't do ♥♥♥♥ about it and decided to abandon the game.\n\nIn other words: no online multiplayer unless you use third party software, and usually people who use these on demigod are hacking.\n\nThis game would've got an easy 8/10 if it wasn't for the developpers losing interest in the game, this could've been a competitor to league of legends, but then again they used an extremely old internet service for their game (stardock was already known to suck, the reason why they were chosen is because of budgetary reasons).\n\nAnd no, the single player mode doesn't save this game: no campaign, no backstory, nada.

This issue has since been resolved, and is no longer an issue; the multiplayer works just fine now, no real problems.\n\nNow, from there, let's get into a few aspects of the game itself:\n\nDemigod is a MOBA style game, where you play as a single hero/champion/demigod/whatever style character who starts off kinda flimsy, and gradually levels up, fighting large armies of enemy units with the goal of defeating the enemy team. Thing LoL, HoN, DotA, Smite, Dawngate and so on.\n\nWhere Demigod leaves the rest of the pack, is that it focuses very heavily upon a small number of highly customizable and remarkably in depth characters, rather than a large number of half-done characters which is par for the course for the rest of the genre. Yes, everyone loves pudge and mundo, but they really simply aren't on par with pretty much anything in Demigod, and the Rook is just kind of a game ender in that contest =P\n\nThe next part where Demigod leaves traditional MOBA-style gameplay behind, is it focuses very heavily upon strategic assets and tactical control; holding onto flags is a game-changer, and you can upgrade or add to your army, with a remarkably large wealth of global upgrades for your whole team and even your minions.\n\nYou heard me right; other mobas rely on the concept of both sides having equal minions for the most part, a perpetual stalemate where the players are the only force that changes the tide of war, and minions are simply an exp/gold payday. In Demigod, however, you can capture the portals from an enemy that spawns their minions, upgrade your own minions, or even purchase new minions to be added to waves, such as healers or catapultasauri (yes, catapult dinosaurs, epix win, I know).\n\nAnother major part about Demigod is that the only gold comes from passive gold gain, and from killing Demigods/towers. How does this work? Well, mines are strategically set up around the map, and these can be captured to steal the gold away from the enemy team. Think Dawngate, but significantly more potent to hold onto more mines and territory, but harder to keep the strategic parts long term.\n\nYet another neat feature are items which can be purchased from points earned in any game, wherein these points last perpetually between games. Once you buy one of these special items, you can dump it onto your demigod at the start of a new round for free... but you only get one out of a list of about 20. It's an interesting feature, to say the least.\n\nAgain, we have another major feature that changes Demigod from all of it's competitors... virtually every single other MOBA out there has your character max all their skills out at maximum level. In Demigod, you instead get a much larger skill-tree (think closer to diablo-2), and will have to pick and choose which abilities to level over time. In this manner, the same character can play very differently from one match to the next... in one match, Sedna may be a general carrying around an army of minions and aura items, spamming heals out; in the next match, she might be a remarkably high-speed assassin with strong burst and self healing/regeneration. As such, your character choice has a significant impact upon the game, but you have a lot more leeway after character select than in most other MOBAs which can often be decided simply based on team composition.\n\nThe last major part about Demigod which sets it apart from the crowd, is it actually has a wealth of options for adjusting the game's difficulty and gameplay for each game played, and a remarkably robust AI. Co-op in Demigod is still farther along than even League of Legends, and most other MOBAs don't even have a co-op mode at all.\n\n\n\nEnd verdict:\n\nDemigod fails in a few minor ways, but not by a lot. Some of it's strengths make it a good game, but not a good MOBA for serious pro-level PvP. It's well worth the money for what it is, however, and it's probably the single best MOBA-style option out there for people who want to play co-op with their friends rather than PvP. Is it the best MOBA out there? No, but it's definitely one of the better ones and well worth looking into. Just keep in mind that the multiplayer community is kind of dead these days, so bring your own friends.\n\nOverall, it deserves a good 75-85%, with variation for personal taste and whether you have friends to play with or not.","January 29, 2012","true","112.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

I have owned this game from the first time it came out.  And I have hundreds of hours on this game.\n\nThis is one game that does not get the respect it deserves.  It is a complicated MOBA and it requires you to think on how your strategy is to be played out.  And it is not as fast as games like DOTA2, so it gives you a little time to think (not much though).\nIt is not a MOBA like Dota games.  In this game you do not destroy towers, except for the citadel which will end the game.  In Demigod you control flags and each flag has different buffs and the control of the object they are near.  (I.E. Portals,)  When you control a flag that is next to a portal you team gets that portal and the minions that come out of that portal belong to your team as long as you control the flag.  Plus there are character upgrades and Citadel upgrades and you can buy artifacts from the store or a special store that requires the capture of a flag.  Also there are artifact upgrades that you can purchase with Favor points that stay with you from game to game.  And the characters have a lot of spells that completely identify to their character type.\nPretty much everyone agrees that the graphics and animation is stunning, and they are.  And for a 2009 game they hold up to any game.  And the strategy is deep and you will learn to hate your friends all over again.  This game is brutal and non-forgiving.\nThe main complaints from people are\n1.	No tutorial.  And it doesn’t.  This was a bad mistake by GPG.  The game does have a strong learning curve.  This causes people not to understand the game, and go on to something else.\n2.	The internet lobby is bad. And it is.  The Internet Lobby is limited.\nBut my friends mostly play among ourselves.  It works over internet and Local LAN Hosting.\n\nFor me it is good to have a MOBA that is not like DOTA, Not that I have complaints about DOTA and I also play DOTA2,  but there are just so many DOTA like games out there.  And most of them seem to have the same map, and the interfaces seem to close to the same.

That being said , items sadly lack diversity , and you will find yourself reapeating one and the same build throughout the game. About the actual gameplay , as said before , you contribute to your team's victory in more than one way , capturing checkpoints to spawn additional minions , or instead of investing gold on yourself , you can invest it in upgrades for your own team , from purchasing smaller death penalties to upgrading minions , and a lot more.

The premise is simple in that you grab your legion, secure some portals and wipe out the opponents "base". And while doing so, set up defensive structures and level up your DemiGod.

Very basic tower defense game (TDG) that has single player "skirmish" and multiplayer modes, from 1 vs. 1 to 5 vs. 5 players.\n\nIt feels like it wasn't meant to be a full online / multiplayer experience like other TD games. Game didn't get popular enough to compete with League of Legends, Heroes of Newearth and other tower defense games. Has unique maps, not your average "creeps run in line to enemy base" layout. Limited number of "Heroes", your basic melee and ranged types, nukers, tanks and supports.\n\nCharacter design is good with great abilities, animation, model quality and textures. Environment quality is really basic, not a lot of detail, mostly stone, concrete grey surfaces, with magic and arrow towers. Maps are located in "space", looks like you're battling in "divine heights" after all. There are different places on maps that you can capture, some add gold income, some increase creep health and damage, others boost your health / mana regeneration, etc.\n\nYou can buy items for head, chest, belt, boots, gloves, accessory slots as well as buy special "Hero summonable creeps" - ranged, melee and healer types, that you can control and resummon if killed through the match. Killing creeps, enemy heroes and capturing objectives on map grant you experience, thus you level up. Maximum level is 20, and each time you level you can spend points to upgrade your HERO "1234 aka QWER" abilities or upgrade the BASE skills (creep health, add unique creeps to waves, etc.).\n\nGame doesn't feel like your typical TDG, and is somewhat unique. Downside is that not many people play multiplayer, and there's not much diversity to keep you going for long time. Game itself is a short and basic TD experience, that I personally enjoyed playing.","July 6, 2014","true","2.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This is one of the best DOTA clones in my opinion. It brought new ideas, is very pretty, sounds fantastic. Great production all around. It deserved better success.

Worse still, Stardock has labeled the project a failure, and there will be no more work done on the game. If you want to play a MOBA, but you hate last-hitting, try Heroes of the Storm. I hear it is more of a Hero brawler, and less of a MOBA, but it is probably a better use of your money.\n\nI'll admit I enjoyed the game, when I still felt motivated to play it, and I got it for a whole $2, so I suppose I got a good value.

Rubbish. Worthless. You have a shïtty ten "characters" to pick from, and you'd expect that with a roster that tiny, the few that're available will all feel completely unique and incredibly well-made, polished to a mirror sheen and then some! But guess what? NOPE! The so-called "characters" are all bland and uninteresting, and there's absolutely zero balance between them.\n\nHell, there's absolutely zero balance in the game PERIOD! Now, I haven't played it for a while, so I can't know for sure, but last time I DID play it worked like this: earn a focking rëtardedly massive amount of gold, buy All-Father's Ring, win the game. Because buying a singular item REALLY should make so much difference to everything in the game that you LITERALLY become unstoppable, unkillable and automatically win. Honestly, I don't get why they wouldn't just make it so that whichever player gets that focking stupid amount of unspent gold "earns" his/her team a victory auto-stupid-matically.\n\nThe game has so many glitches, balance issues and outrageously rëtarded design errors that it's just plain unplayable.

It has a really awesome look to it and have some decent opening story, however what has unimpressed me is the actual gameplay is like a single-player Dota2, but with a couple of changed. One being that you can summon your own minions to aid you, you can also upgrade your citadel so that the waves of spawn that attack the enemy's spawn get better armour, weapons and units to help give a tactical edge in a sense of Command and Conquer and researching technology, but spending gold to do that means you won't be able to buy items for yourself to equip at the shop.\n\nYou have capture points too and as I said this game is fun if you like the Dota2 style and it's got some unique characters and a compelling story, but it's a shame that there is no campaign mode because I would've loved that. The idea that the different worlds would end differently depending on the demigod you chose.\n\nThis game really isn't for me, I already have Dota2 and I'm not really a fan of that game either so unfortunatly I'm not going to spend anymore time on this game.","March 15, 2014","false","0.6"," 1 of 7 people (14%) found this review helpful","14","1","7","0","0"

Steam needs to change the ability of a current owner of a game to be able to purchase a 4 pack as gifts.  So be warned, buy the 4 pack, and not the single player.\n\nThe maps are the best part of the game.  The fact that things change, and it's not the same laning every. single. time....

Varied selection of unique champions.\n2. Skill trees allow for more than 1 combo of skills which makes each time playing a champion differ from previous times.\n3. Several unique maps to chose from with each one containing objectives to capture.\n4. Skilled AI system that allows for the game to be tuned to fight on your level in a player vs AI match.\n5. The graphics are very good for a MOBA.\n6. Lots of upgrades and plenty of items to pick.\n\nBad:\n1. The game feels very slow in pacing which can make very simple decisions fatal. (like accidently stepping into an AoE and taking 5 seconds to get out of it)\n2. The towers aren't a big deal when you have at least 1 minion around thanks to them usually targeting minions, so tower diving is easy when it shoudn't be.\n3. Even with movement accelerating gear; getting to lane is an adventure. It takes about 30sec just to travel from the base to your "lane" even with a good bit of movement speed gear.\n4. Some character animation take a while to pull off (Such as regulas gaining his wings) and will end up practically making you stun yourself for a few seconds.\n5. Towers can be hit from out of their range with certain champions.\n\nUgly:\n1. The ballence between champions is missing. Almost completely. Take for example Regulas. This champion is supposed to have the best range in the game, yet His snipe ability does a measly 500 at max rank while another champion can (with high range) throw a knife to deal over 900 damage. Regulas' ability require a windup where this knife slinger champion does not.\n2. The champion "rook" can practically stage a 1 man wrecking machine event where he is able to practically run down towers with almost no damage taken thanks to an ability that restores a large sum of hp (800-2000) while dealing the same amount as damage to the targeted tower. This, with his 700-1700 dmg hammer, will almost 2 shot building aside from the citadel.\n3. Rook also has a very troll ability. He can damage a building while healing himself. This can be used on ANY building in the map including the Citadel. So he can literally end his own team if he so desired.\n4. Being that this game is so uncommon in the multiplayer servers, nobody will be on to play with for about 99.99% of the time. This pretty much means if you want to play with anything besides an AI, you need to buy another copy for a friend, or just have them buy it.\n","June 15, 2014","false","8.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Several unique maps to chose from with each one containing objectives to capture.\n4. Skilled AI system that allows for the game to be tuned to fight on your level in a player vs AI match.\n5. The graphics are very good for a MOBA.\n6. Lots of upgrades and plenty of items to pick.\n\nBad:\n1. The game feels very slow in pacing which can make very simple decisions fatal. (like accidently stepping into an AoE and taking 5 seconds to get out of it)\n2. The towers aren't a big deal when you have at least 1 minion around thanks to them usually targeting minions, so tower diving is easy when it shoudn't be.\n3. Even with movement accelerating gear; getting to lane is an adventure. It takes about 30sec just to travel from the base to your "lane" even with a good bit of movement speed gear.\n4. Some character animation take a while to pull off (Such as regulas gaining his wings) and will end up practically making you stun yourself for a few seconds.\n5. Towers can be hit from out of their range with certain champions.\n\nUgly:\n1. The ballence between champions is missing. Almost completely. Take for example Regulas. This champion is supposed to have the best range in the game, yet His snipe ability does a measly 500 at max rank while another champion can (with high range) throw a knife to deal over 900 damage. Regulas' ability require a windup where this knife slinger champion does not.\n2. The champion "rook" can practically stage a 1 man wrecking machine event where he is able to practically run down towers with almost no damage taken thanks to an ability that restores a large sum of hp (800-2000) while dealing the same amount as damage to the targeted tower. This, with his 700-1700 dmg hammer, will almost 2 shot building aside from the citadel.\n3. Rook also has a very troll ability. He can damage a building while healing himself. This can be used on ANY building in the map including the Citadel. So he can literally end his own team if he so desired.\n4. Being that this game is so uncommon in the multiplayer servers, nobody will be on to play with for about 99.99% of the time. This pretty much means if you want to play with anything besides an AI, you need to buy another copy for a friend, or just have them buy it.\n","June 15, 2014","false","8.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In fact, I fully agree that Demigod is a really underrated game, and it's one of the few MOBAs I could relate to Dota in terms of quality.\nIt doesn't have the complexity of the previous one, but it is still quite entertaining even so. It requires thinking and study - although not as much as Dota -, mainly due to it's minions system. Being so, the game doesn't feel boring after a while - even though, I guess an in-game recommended item build would be very helpfull.\nWhile it is a bit hard to add inovative elements to the game genre, Demigod succeeds in having it's own traits that defines it's originality. Each hero has a unique story and they all seem to avoid the commonplace; it's quite easy to feel empathy for some characters (such as Rook - literally a moving castle).\nWhat may bother some is that the game's active community is actually pretty scarce. The AI is enough to keep the game fun and interesting; but being a MOBA, it is possible to feel the lack of other players after a while.\nIn summary, I do recommend Demigod, it surely is worth it's cost. The game succeds in keeping you entertained, even though you have to rely mainly on playing against the AI.","June 23, 2014","true","6.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/RoosterCastille/recommended/202710/","RoosterCastille","Rooster Castille","http://steamcommunity.com/id/RoosterCastille/","68 products in account","This is a MOBA. I'm not sure I understood that before I bought it but once I was in a game I realized, oh, this is laning and pushing and knocking down towers. There's a few differences, you take territory rather than simply wrecking enemy towers, and you can spend money to benefit your entire team with team upgrades and tower upgrades, as well as purchasing things for yourself. And you can have an army of your own minions, to either back you up or handle a different objective than your hero. The heroes are all pretty slow and the maps are pretty big so you do spend an enormous amount of time walking back and forth to buy things and heal and return to battle. Not long into any game the heroes get so powerful that if you are absent from a lane for even a moment, an enemy can take out a tower or two, so I find that a high HP and regend build is sort of OP, allowing you to stay in lane and push, even if your DPS isn't very good. Just being present matters more than being powerful. Some characters appear to be suited for certain roles, IE assassins or tanks, but some characters seem a bit strange. The plant lady would seem to be to be suited best with a big minion army, but she can also tank a bit, and has quite a bit of tower damage and creep extermination, leading me to think that the characters aren't very balanced. If that character has one good build but is flexible enough to be effective at literally everything else, I don't think the character's central role is powerful enough to not opt into the other branches of their tree. Though honestly in my experience the games last so long that you max out nearly everything by the time you win.\nAgain, the heroes get pretty strong. You may spend a lot of money upgrading your towers and minions but it may not matter later on. This leads me to think that completely balanced hero upgrades does not mean that the other upgrades in the game are as balanced.\nThe controls aren't quite fluid and there are times when I died because of it, but eventually I simply learned the quirks of the controls and the incomplete physics of bodyblocking to better avoid stupidly dying to inadequate game physics.\n\nIn my opinion this isn't nearly as fun as it should be. A MOBA where you effectively play as really huge characters and you take territory, it sounds really good as a recipe, but the result isn't quite as satisfying as the recipe sounds.","July 11, 2014","false","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This proto-moba could have had a lot going for it, and I would be thrilled to see some of the demi-gods show up in Smite, as at least 2 (Sedna and Queen of thorns, aka The Obsidion Butterfly) are real historical dieites.  The Queen may show up, shes Aztac/Mayan, but i doubt they will fit in a lone Inuit diety in the mix.  Still between the two Sedna is the one with a dwarf planet named after her.","July 14, 2014","false","0.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

This was the first arena genre game I played.  I enjoyed the style, the graphics and some of the characters in particular.  The general 'capture the flag' feel of the game means you can play a number of rounds on your own or with friends in an hour.\nHowever, the game needs polish.  It lacks a tutorial or really any information on how to play the game. I also found the speed difficult initially and the suggestions online were really helpful in getting more comfortable with the game.  My other issue was that I found after playing for a while that I didn't really have a strong reason to go back to it unless I wanted a quick bash.\nEven so it was a worthwhile experience and I'd still recommend it despite the steep learning curve.","January 1, 2014","true","29.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But the thing is that it's a good game, it looks great, the classes are varied (even if there are only about 10 character choices), and it's pretty deep. Unlike other MOBA games Demigod allows you to not only spend money on your hero and his items, but upgrade your towers, nexus/castle, even minion waves.\n\nIt has a bunch of unique elements but it let down by the fact it never got the promised expanded champion roster, making this a game fun for LANs (until DotA2 released officially) but not for online play.
