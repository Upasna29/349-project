Very similar to the first game, Rise of Clans features more twists in the story than an M. Night Shyamalan movie. Quests usually are not more than go here, deliver thing, go there kill bad guys, or find this, but it works.\nHalf the fun is the glitchy mess that HTA is, with terrible ai and bugged missions, but it works often enough that it's not detracting from the game.\n\nAlso dosn't hurt that it's impossible to find retail.\n\nEasily worth the $6.","March 19, 2014","true","17.0"," 35 of 41 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","35","41","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/AroNocebo/recommended/286810/","AroNocebo","- Aro -","http://steamcommunity.com/id/AroNocebo/","415 products in account","For my opinion on Ex Machina as a whole,  check out my review for the original game as my opinion on this installment is essentially the same. It is just as fun as the original and still has its quirks.\n\nJust like the original, this game has an in-depth storyline with lots of optional side-quests to participate in, you're also filling the shoes of the charismatic protagonist Vagrant, so the story doesn't directly continue after where the first Ex Machina left off, but rather continues from a different perspective. While Meridian 113 isn't as lengthy as the original, it brings some new additions to the table and some small improvements here and there too; It also feels very fast paced when compared to the original too.\nNew additions consist of new weapons, utilities, loot mechanics, and new vehicles to choose from during your missions, all of which add a nice refreshing touch to the game. Some of the improvements are a nice touch too such as the improved map previews and the ability to repair your vehicle on the go with scrap you acquired from the enemy you just destroyed.\n\nAs already mentioned, the game still has it's quirks such as the grammatical and spelling errors caused by bad translation to English from Russian, the physics still leave something to be desired and the voice acting is still questionable, though this is only the case for a handful of characters in the game, the voice acting for Sam for example is excellent whereas One-Eyed is classic Ex-Machina voice acting. This doesn't bother me though, it's just something that gives the Ex Machina series it's charm.\n\nSo all in all, if you liked the original, you will also like this. These games are worth every penny be they on sale or not, but as stated in my review for the first game, this is not a franchise for everybody, I'd still suggest giving it a try though if you're looking for something different to play.\n\nHere's hoping Targem Games are planning to develop another installment to this great franchise!","November 14, 2014","true","8.7"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","13","15","0","0"

It's also kind of old. This game is from the mid-'00s, and there are some issues getting it to work reliably on new systems [like it failing to save video settings after restarting, occasional crashes]. The translation from Russian is a bit rough, but overall the gameplay of driving about and shooting all sorts of things is compelling. Especially because you get to customize your rig, not just with different chassies, but within chassises. You tend to have three or so different models of cab and/or trailer to swap out, equip, and possibly even load up with cargo.\n\nJust driving along blasting hostiles is a good way to make money, also.\n\n\nOne complaint I'd have is in a mid-late game mission you're dropped into a stationary turret to defend a base from a wave of robots. It feels mostly luck-based, and I had to mash my head against it many a time.","June 15, 2015","true","25.4"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","10","10","0","3"

This game is the worst of the two Hard Truck Apocalypse games. Granted, for $1.50 (on sale) you get what you pay for.\n\nPros:\nTrucks with guns\nTruck models are nice\nMore customizable colors for trucks and the ability to add decals (when available).\nLike the previous HT:A, you have easy to use driving/aiming using keyboard and mouse\nPerks system: This is kind of a WTF. You have them, but I didn't see any way that they helped or hindered. It was never obvious.\n\nCons:\nVoice acting: ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE! Weird language, lack of inflection, etc.\nStory: Disjointed. Nonsensical. Your character is the most naive, trusting, moronic human being in the freaking planet. You are looking for some place called "Edmonton" for no other reason than it is there. Along the way you join forces with the obviously badguy "Sam" (who looks like Uncle sam). You also meet someone named "One-Eyed" who sounds like they are your friend, but (spoiler alert) you end up killing her because she won't give you a box of old filmstrips and she decides to attack you because you bothered to ask. So you kill her. But you seem to think that Sam is an OK guy despite threatening to kill you and wanting to find an ultimate weapon. Also, bad guys are super tough for no reason and they are ALL OVER THE PLACE. You can't even leave a town without getting blown up (seriously, it happened multiple times).\nMoney: In the first HT:A you could actually make money trading. It made sense. Not in this one. It's cheaper to go out and kill bad guys and sell their stuff.\nSide quests: Like the first HT:A, they are essentially "go here, kill this", "guard this slow guy" (p.s. if you let the cargo truck die, you get a LOT more money fromt heir death drop), or "go here, deliver this package." After a while, I stopped doing those as there was no point.\nVideo issues: There were options to improve the graphics, but the game would refuse to load after I upped them from "medium" (the default). Had to go and reverify the game files before it would load with the default graphics.\n\nIf you can look past the bad voice acting, horrible story, and just random goofiness, it's an ok game. It is fun driving around blowing things up and running over pedestrians (which apparently is ok, but bumping into another vehicle will ♥♥♥♥ them off).","June 21, 2014","false","12.0"," 13 of 21 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","13","21","0","0"

In this version, you can make a respectable amount of money just blowing up other vehicles as opposed to trading, you can carry around repair parts, and you get to equip the sleeker, faster raider chasies from the otiginal. Paint and decoration give stat bonuses, etc.\n\nIt's also really short, which is unfortunate.

Unfortunately, the car doesn't follow the mouse (only the turret does) and this feature combined with the already clunky controls means it feels like you're piloting a remotely controlled vehicle.\n\nThe graphics are nothing to wrote home about, the voice acting is horrendous, the writing is confusing but the game does have some charm. I like the way you can buy new vehicles, mount different types of guns and haul loot all over the place. Like a poor man's Freelancer set in a post-nuclear America.\n\nUnfortunately, I drove my car inside a wall and couldn't get it out any more (the 'return to road' button did nothing. In fact, many buttons that you can bind seem to do nothing. Or maybe they have been mistranslated like so many other thingsI also didn't use the quick-save ability at any point (another thing we left behind in the 90's, thankfully) so I doubt I'll be able to revert to an earlier save game.\n\nI have to say that I really like the theme but everything about this game is just subpar to the point where it just annoys me.\n\nRefund requested.\n\nNote that it ran just fine on Windows 7 64-bit for me. At least for the 30-odd minutes that I played it.","November 7, 2015","false","0.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

There's also more cutscenes and a bit more of a story. Unfortunately, the result is buggy, and somehow, much WORSE than the first game.\n\nRise of Clans have you, "The Vagrant", on a quest to reach "Edmonton" in "Le Canada". You run into towns in your "Scout" (one of fast but small vehicles), and you end up fighting a lot of people here and there, as you run into "Sam", who then task you for some missions...\n\nThe cutscenes are horrible, and the translations are just... Oh dear. People swear with expressions like "Holy Fuel" and "Drill my carburetor" (huh?)  And it's a wonder how did the voice actor actually read the lines with a straight face. It's just completely atrocious translation.\n\nSomehow the game got MUCH MUCH harder, as even on "rookie" level I died every few minutes, and as there is no autosave, I have to save manually QUITE often.\n\nThen my entire save profile was corrupted. Lost HOURS of progress.\n\nAlso ran into a mission that's virtually impossible and it's widely reported as impossible and depends on LUCK rather than skill.\n\nForget about this game.

I played form start to finished and really enjoyed it. It took me back to my Freelancer days when making money was all about trading, killing and doing missions, and there's a lot of that to go round. Once more to add, the scaling of vehicles, not just, "Here's a new vehicle" but, swapping out Cabs and Trunks to upgrade was fun, and arming to the teeth is also great.\n\nAlso boss fights. The game didn't need them but they were in and they're great. Fun patterns to work out insted of just, hit it until it dies.\n\nThe only places this game flops on is it's user unfriendliness towards modern systems, the dialouge is pretty much B-movie and if you're not a fan of games like Freelancer you're not gonig to enjoy it.\n\nUnforutnately to get it running you'll need to find a way of doing it. I found a patch but the links where it was hosted are, dead, and unfortuantely I didn't take them all. Good luck with getting it working if you decide to get it.
