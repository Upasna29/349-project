"http://steamcommunity.com/id/phydeaux86/recommended/420930/","phydeaux86","Phydeaux86","http://steamcommunity.com/id/phydeaux86/","462 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI had beta access to CHKN, graciously provided by one of the members of Katapult (who was also a fellow Game Design student with me!)\n\nI had opened this game for the first time on 3/31 to stream it on my Twitch channel before the game released.  I was expecting, after seeing videos and having the game described, a cute, cuddly Spore meets Minecraft style game.  BOY WAS I WRONG!  I started the game, and was greeted with a very clear, concise menu.  Very smooth and easy to navigate.  After that, this is where the nightmares began.  I started on a shore with some pretty normal chickens...nothing too exciting.  I slapped an egg, and was immediately killed by a protective chicken (10/10 would slap eggs again).\nAfter progressing a little further, getting my wits about me after being pecked to death...I wandered inland a bit.  Here I was greeted by monstrous, disturbing, nighmarish creatures with the faces of a chicken and the body/legs of godzilla.  There were octopus-scorpions on land, feathery dogs, and horse-giraffes.  (By the way, the bull people are testy, don't get too close.)\n\nSo, overall...a very fun, very variety filled game...but not sure if younger children will love or hate the freaky creatures.  I know my son would love it...sadistic lil dude.\n\nVideo of first impressions/gameplay (ignore the random mutes, YouTube thinks there's copyrighted content in there somewhere.): Video Review/Gameplay\n\nNow, the technical things...we'll start off with the GOOD:\nUI was awesome, intuitive, great color scheme.\nObject/creature variety was amazing.\nControls are solid.\nA less hardcore entry into the survival/sandbox genre.\nYou can play god with minimal consequences.\n\nNow, the not-so-good:\nSounds are 2D and are based on the player, no positional audio.  If in range of a creature, you can hear it just as loud as if it was next to you.  Suggest changing to 3d audio with a limited range for dropoff.  Will help with players that use headphones (like myself).\nNo control list/customization as of yet for controllers/keybinds (in-game, the launcher has Input editor)\nRunning feels weird.  The player controller seems velocity based, so when you stop running, you still have some momentum and don't have accuracy of where you'll stop.\n\nOverall, a VERY solid 9.5/10 for an Early Access game.  I think the only other Steam Early Access game I've played that is anywhere near this completed is Ark...this trumps almost any other game.  Very very very good job, good choice of assets and sounds, and I look forward to weird, bizarre, unholy creature battles in multiplayer...especially in a LAN party setting.","April 2","true","3.0"," 49 of 54 people (91%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","91","49","54","10","2"

And in my opinion, 90% of games like that are awesome.\n\nThe best way I can desribe CHKN is the original Spore title mixed with either Minecraft or ARK. You are put on a large island full of wacky creatures, and you need to survive. What makes it fun is you can make your own creatures from body parts of dead creatures or eggs. And believe me, you can make anything. A chicken with arms that have crab mouthes for hands? Go ahead! A tarantula with octopus tentacles? Go ahead! Your imagination is your only limit. If you liked Spore and you like Minecraft, you should definitely give CHKN a spin!","April 8","true","3.2"," 14 of 14 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","14","14","0","0"

Unlike most of the typical sandbox games, it has that "humor" factor to it. Being able to make a creature that clearly has no business being alive is always a good time. Since this is still a early access game of corse there is still going to be a few bugs. Somethings I've seen may be easy fixed depending on coding. The FOV in the water and not being able to sink is strange, not a huge game changer. The only other thing is the sound. As you are walking around you can tell if a MOB is near you or in the distance.  I was told this mite be a 2D sound instead of a 3D. All that aside so far it's a really soild game. I'm looking forward to jumping into the mulitplayer with a few friends and getting into some fights\n\nGraphics 8/10-only because of the FOV\nSound 8/10- Due to the 2D sound\nReplay 9/10- So easy to be entertained\n\nHell yeah i recommand this game","April 1","true","0.2"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","15","17","0","0"

It's what happens when a Minecraft-like game and a Spore-like game have a love child :-) It's fun, it's frustrating, and most of all it's a great ride (once you tame a large creature and make a saddle that it).

I'm excited coming back and reading all of the news. No more striking, more animal parts, caves coming soon, better loop audio for effects, stamina, sprinting? All totally amazing. the one game I can truly say that they devs are indeed listening. Talk about fast development. Good job on the game guys! Hugs to you all and thx for the hard effort and dedication towards this project. I'm sure plenty of people are really excited. I know I am. :DD\n\nCheers!!\n\nMy recommendation:\nI have to say I posted many suggestions and so did many other people. The game has a dedicated team. This is a family orientated game. Imagine a santbox game where you can truly be your own version of franskenstein. No other game has taken it this far before. I totally recommend it even in it's current stage. Well worth the money spent. If anything it's too cheap for what you get already. You never have a feeling of being ripped off. Check out the news sections in community hub to see all the fixed and additions they add so frequently. Imagine the possibilities with a game like this. TOo many games fit into the block style genre but not many that stick out as unique as this one with the ability to make your own creations and bring them to life when you make a new creature. Imagine a floating or flying tutle or blimp animal that can hold your home? This game keeps evolving. I suggest it for families as well. The game looks amazing and handles well. The devs work hard and they listen. Truly an amazing experience. And with so much more to come! Stay tuned as it developes further! :DD","May 16","true","34.5"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","1"

Also sometimes everything starts walking in circles and apparently your charecter is frozen, But you dont know untill your friend says, "Why aren't you moving" Because you are able to move on your screen.\n- The lag is insanity, I put up with lag in a lot of games, but this lag is just unbareble, the frames drop really low, And the weird part is is that i have 8 GB ram and this game only requires 4 GB ram\n\nConclusion\nI give this game 9/10 because everything is great except for the unbareble multiplayer lag/glitches.","April 19","true","6.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","3"

I've played an hour with a friend and realized the multiplayer is terrible. the cons of multiplayer are to much for me to enjoy the game. Here is a list of things I found wrong with the multiplayer already.\n\n- Can't Host Dedicated Server\n- Incredibly Laggy\n- Doesn't Save Non-Host Progress\n- Desyncronization\n- Make Server Public Instantly get trolled by Randoms\n\nThese are just a few problems I've run into but I am not saying this is a bad game, It is a great game and I am glad I have a copy, I will look forward to the game and its future updates and hope that they fix these things.

You would most likely enjoy this game if you enjoyed any of the following\n-Minecraft\n-Spore\n-ARK: Survival Evolved\n-Or any other survival game\n\nThis game is filled with tons of opritunities! You will be able to do things all the time! Their are some downsides to this game, but most of those are only glitches. I must say this game is filled with glitches, but it is only in early access, and from what I have seen developers are working on this game non-stop.\n\nSpeaking of developers, I have seen myself how fast devs respond to you on the forums. I made a post on the forums about Troughs, and in under 16 hours a dev had responded to me telling me about the problem and if they will change it in the future.\n\nHere are my final ratings for this game:\n\nGAMEPLAY 8/10\n-The game has a very unique gameplay. One like I had never seen before. It has tons of hours of fun in the game!\n\nPLAY TIME 7/10\n-Currently the game has a lot to do, but just not enough if you are like me and play thousands of hours on games, BUT this will not stay for long. They add new stuff almost every week! You are sure to be able to get a lot out of this game, especially when it fully comes out!\n\nGLITCHES AND BUGS 3/10\n-The game has many different bugs and many different glitches in it, but it is still in early access.\n\nUPDATES 10/10\n-The devs work on this game non-stop. They bring so many new updates ranging from bug fixes to new creatures! It is absolutely outrageous.\n\nOVERALL 8/10\n-The game has its downs, but the game is mostly just pure fun! You can play for hours alone or with friends! This game is a must have game in my opinion. If you rage because of bugs I would hold off until the game is fully realeased, but for the rest of you I would get it now.\n\nRecomenneded!","June 1","true","38.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Let me explain below...\nhttps://youtu.be/Kp5GJmipxUY\n\nCHKN is an amazing concept and it's pretty well executed, though buggy atm.\nIt's fun, it's cute -in that kind of horrific abomination kind of way-, and works decently well in the whole "create your own creatures" and survival ways.\n\nThe bugs hinder it though, and frankly, multiplayer is a fair way from being stable.\n(Hint: You may want to wait a bit if you mainly plan to play it MP)\nFor example, I loaded a save game and suddenly an entire hillside (including the house I was building) had vanished... suddenly it was bare as a baby's bottom.\n\nSupposedly though, that's already been patched, a mere couple of hours after release; and that's part of why I hesitantly recommend the title. There's a lot of potential here, but you can say that about many things on early access. Seeing the devs quickly hop into fixing something and getting it patched so quickly gives me a bit of hope for the game's future.\n\nOverall though, given the fun to be had, and the price point for it, I'd say it's worth the money. And if not right now, then in the near future. If you can tolerate "roughing it" through the early access bugs, CHKN is a breath of fresh air in the survival genre that's getting all too stale lately.","April 1","true","4.8"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","2","5","0","0"

But anyways, it is a really fun game! I love how you can create monsters, or loveable pets!

Not That I would recommend that. Hundreds of possible combinations, dozens of animal cubes, and crafting options. You can edit any creature you tame.  You arent stuck with one abomination, have 3! I will say that controlling the beasts seems a bit wonky, can't always get them to follow you and they take naps on the fly.
