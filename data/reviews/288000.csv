I would for now put this game at a 4 in that it is a solid game with lots of improvement that can be added to make it a super strong game.\n\nps to the gamemaker you should make a zombe survival single player campagn like dying light or the new nighmare zombies mode in black ops 3. As that would make a great new game\n\nThanks to the new update i have to add some updates to my review. The new map is god but the old one was ok there should be 2 maps but i recomend this game now and the rating is a 4","November 21, 2015","true","8.5"," 2 of 14 people (14%) found this review helpful","14","2","14","0","0"
