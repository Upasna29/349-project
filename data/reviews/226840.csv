It stays true to the style and feel of the previous games in the series, while also embracing some of the more modern elements in the 4X genre. Some may find the game a bit "simplistic" compared to other 4x games, but this is misleading. While this game is very easy to learn, and keeps most of the numbers and math pretty simple, there is an incredible amount of strategic depth to this game, and even after over 500 hours played, with 90% of that focusing on just *one* class, I am still learning new things.\n\nThe game itself takes place on about 3 different levels. The most prominent level is the tactical combat itself. This is unmatched by any other game in the 4x genre. In truth, it's more akin to the Total War series than anything, except turn based. It is not an understatement to say that this is the best combat system in any of the modern 4x games, bar none.\n\nThe second level is strategic movement. Many reviewers and players alike who only play this game for a bit do not understand just how much thought goes into something as simple as moving troops around. Each hex has different movement costs, which affects how fast units can move across them. But the movement costs are variable based on race, unit type itself, and even what the player has researched. Furthermore, different types of units may benefit from terrain features, such as Druids and Rogues who have units with Concealment. This allows some of their units to be rendered invisible in forest tiles. Compounding this issue is how classes and races interact. For instance, Dwarven Rogues are the only combination in the game with access to mountain concealment from the beginning, and this allows for some rather unique strategies involving raiding parties in the early game. While many will say that the tactical combat in this game is what stands out, at the intermediate skill level, the strategic level may actually be more important. After all, you can't actually GET to tactical combat if your enemy utilizes terrain to outrun you, or to reach your cities before your main army can get there to repel them.\n\nThe third layer is the empire management layer. This layer is pretty much what your typical 4x player expects to be the bulk of the game, as games like Civ largely ignore the first 2 to focus entirely on management. To those who have played and enjoyed the Civilization series: be warned. Age of Wonders 3 handles city management *vastly* differently than most other 4x games. The key difference lies in how cities work. Unlike civilization, there are no wonders or structures that can be built in cities to give them a specialized role. But don't worry, there absolutely are ways to make cities unique. Where this game differs from most others is that cities are largely defined by the terrain features within their domain. This creates a very different feel to empire management than other 4x games, in that the single most important factor of a city lies in where it is placed. In fact, a city placed on the right structure can often unlock units that cannot be accessed normally, or allow unusual and powerful modifiers to your armies. Some even give massive bonuses to income, or research.\n\nWhile each layer is important, it is worth noting that this game is still very much different from many other 4x games. The focus is of the game is, at its heart, a wargame. While the diplomacy is functional, the predominant strategy will always be to crush your enemies, and annex their cities. Make no mistake, though. Although the goal is the same in every game, the methods are as variable as your imagination.\n\nI'm not exaggerating when I say that there are players in the multiplayer community who have reputations for using an iconic style or strategy, that is almost entirely their own. The sheer number of options in character creation means that a player could very well run a strategy that is truly unique.\n\nSo if you're looking for a fantasy 4x wargame, you will not find a better one out there. Age of Wonders 3 is simply the best at what it does.","November 8, 2014","true","921.9"," 481 of 510 people (94%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","94","481","510","7","5"

(Which is voluntary, and invites were sent based off of forum participation.)\n\nI like TBS games, generally ones with interesting combat systems, and the last one I genuinely liked was XCOM. I've spent the past years lamenting every TBS game that came out, because of the combat systems that resolve the battle in damage exchanges on the World Map. So I was excited about Fallen Enchantress, and I played it for a while, but it had no multiplayer which inevitably killed it for me.\n\nSo, I was overjoyed to hear that Age of Wonders was returning with all the Tactical Combat and multiplayer features that I so loved.\n\nI've played each of the games in the series, I thought that AoW1 was excellent, AoW2 was abysmal and Shadow Magic was great. For whatever reason, I actually expected to be disappointed by this entry and was considering not buying it. After playing the beta, I can see that my initial instincts were unfounded.\n\nThere are obvious graphical improvements, and I can't really fault them, beyond what I feel is an issue with the change to lower tier unit parties. Though each of the models is well detailed, because they are stood together in a tight stack I feel the units lose a bit of their definition, this might be because of the level at which I zoom out to, but at the end of the day I need to do that to see a practical amount of the battle.\n\nI think the time it takes to enact tactical combat is good, there are speed settings to allow you to increase unit movement and attacks if you're in a hurry, and I generally am. The game ran smooth for the most part, and my biggest issue, which is fairly minor, with the combat is that the hitting animations don't feel particularly visceral in terms of sound, graphical action and reaction. (Some do, but for the T1/T2 melee clashes I didn't feel it was as brutal as the earlier games.)\n\nI prefer the combat system to any TBS that I have played in the past years, and it allows for larger scale battles as well in beautiful settings. (When I compare it to HoMM, which I dislike, or XCOM's, which I loved, or Civ's, which I found boring as I'm sure I would Warlock, etc.)\n\nEach of your Heroes/Leaders has access to a number of upgrades when they level up, leveling up is fairly easy and painless compared to the earlier games (where you had to get the final hit to get the exp) so your heroes become quite strong, quite quickly, but still steps below higher tier units until they reach higher levels. Each hero has it's own class, which grants it access to class specific upgrades, but they all share access to basic upgrades to upgrade stats like Defense, Attack etc. which are fairly straight forward.\n\nEach Hero can become a spell caster, and each class has its own subset of spells, though only one spell can be cast a turn (regardless of how many spell casts you have in a battle) which prevents the issue of your army getting instantly destroyed by a barrage of spells in the first round.\n\nYour heroes have items slots, and you can get items from exploring dungeons etc. You can also make your own items if your city is advanced enough. I felt that there the items available were interesting, particularly the range of mounts (which unlike other gear displays graphically) that allow you to fly about, in the case of wyverns or manticores, and offer other abilities.\n\nI thought the leveling system for heroes was quite good, I found myself often upgrading the default stats and I didn't feel that there was much variation between each hero class type, though there were some cool melee orientated abilities for the Warlord and some interesting ones for the Theocrat, as well as the Rogue. A lot of abilities amounted to global damage reduction to your party, and so the differences amounted to a change in damage type.\n\nThe class you choose for your leader (which has its own levelling/point allocations and is quite similar to a hero) will determine what research/units you will have available to you through the game, as well as three sub-specialitions you can choose when creating your hero which can give you access to new schools of magic, or more practical exploratory/empire building skills. In that regard I thought that there was a good variation of research/summons/units across the six classes and the sub-specializations added extra replayability/variation to that.\n\nUnfortunately, I haven't had time to play the multiplayer.\n\nI thought that one of the campaigns was excellent, and that one of them was good, I had some issues with it, but I expect those will be resolved before release. Both of the campaigns were a cut above any TBS campaign I've played in the past, featured interesting protagonists, solid writing, and excellent voice acting.\n\nEach campaign has a text, voice-acted prologue, and an epilogue for each mission, and throughout each mission there are text pop-outs for dialogue from your enemies and allies. In both campaigns there is a branching point where you have to choose sides so I believe that would result in at least four different endings, though I'm not sure.\n\nEither way, there should be a good amount of replayability and entertainment value from the campaigns, and I'm sure that there will be more to come (both from the developers, and users using the editor), and the excellent mechanics of the games themselves (combat, beautiful world design, variety of units and strategies) will add to the enjoyment of those campaigns.\n\nThere are currently six races, each has different benefits/negatives to its racial units, there are some instances where lower tier units are quite similar, but I think that's to be expected. Overall, I thought there was a good range of units available and that each of the races/class combinations offered a good variety of choice. Across the campaign you play multiple leaders (races/classes) though your main character always sticks with you, either as the leader or as an accompanying hero.\n\nI would recommend the game simply for playing the campaign, or for playing the scenarios available or using the random map generator. If you enjoy TBS games then you'll probably like this one, and it should provide you with hours of entertainment. I intend to play the multiplayer when it comes out, and I imagine it's going to be fun, but as I haven't played it I can't really say for sure.\n","March 2, 2014","true","48.5"," 854 of 966 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","854","966","0","21"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fancyfishie/recommended/226840/","fancyfishie","Fancy Fish","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fancyfishie/","796 products in account","AGE OF WONDERS III - Good Turn based tactical combat, Hero RPG elements and Empire building 4X strategy\n|| 8 ||    Score    Comment        Graphics    8    Nice graphics and detail on the strategic map and even better graphics for units, terrain and magical effects in combat. UI is nice, detailed and easy to use      Audio    6    Music gets a little repetitive - maybe a little more variety needed, sound effects are good but nothing special.    Gameplay    8    Age of Wonders III is a turn based, 4X strategy game based in a fantasy setting. The tactical combat view (when your army's battle) is excellent, you really feel like you are head to head with the AI (which seems to do a good job most of the time) in a battle of wits. Casting a well timed spell or outmanoeuvring your enemy can sometimes turn the tide of a battle, unfortunately usually the outcome of a battle is a forgone conclusion due to the relative strength of the units involved, but even when this is the case its still fun to crush your enemy and minimise your losses. The strength of the Units in your army really plays such a large part of the battles that you can actually choose to skip the tactical battle entirely and have the computer automatically calculate the results. Some of the units have somewhat of a balance issue with the higher level units often being able to take down whole armies by themselves with little damage or risk. This inevitably results in a race to upgrade your city buildings to create these higher level creatures. AI at the strategic level is a little predictable but there is still fun to be had placing your cities and grabbing as many resources as possible to fund your economy. One thing I noticed at the strategic level is there doesn't seem to be any downside to city spamming (covering the map in loads of your cities) as you gain resources (mana, gold, research) for each city. Ruins, shrines and artefacts are scattered throughout the maps and these will often require you to fight a monster to claim the reward for your Hero. Hero's are your army leaders you get a main one and then can hire more for gold. Hero's have a selection of spells they can use to aid you in battle, summon monsters or benefit your cities. Items you collect / make can be given to your hero's to increase their stats and they also get skills as they earn xp through battles.        Story    7    The game contains a number of well written scenario's which are fairly fun to play through. Overall I think I preferred playing the random maps though.         Replayability    7    If you enjoy the game you will probably want to play it again, random maps and steam workshop adds more community made content.        Overall    8    A fan of this genre will probably get a lot of enjoyment out of this game. While not as complex or detailed as others of the same type what it does it does well. Hotseat mode (a mode I loved from Civilisation) is a great addition to this game and playing with friends is a lot of fun.\nMore reviews by Fancy Fish\nAgree / Disagree?

This is equivalent to the default mode of most 4X games like Civilization, and that's what I'll talk about here.\n\nUnlike most 4X games which start you off with a single settler in a mostly empty undeveloped world, the default mode (normal game flow) of AoW3 starts you off in a populated world which already has roads, cities and armies. In these games you can get stuck into the action quickly and may not need to build any cities at all, just capture existing ones. These games can be a lot quicker to play than other 4X games.\n\nHowever, the random map games are extremely customisable, much more than Civ. There are three other preset modes - Battle, Empire Building and Adventure - which provide very different game experiences. Better still, go into the advanced setup screens and you can tweak the details to your heart's content. You can start with nothing more than a settler and a leader in a completely empty world, just like Civ, if that's what you want, or you can fill it with as much or as little of the different options that are available. You can also tweak the geography, altering the quantities of different terrain types that will appear on the map.\n\nThe graphics are superb, they blow away the old AoW games and are better than most current 4X games IMO. The music is excellent too, one of the best soundtracks I've heard in a game, making it well worth getting the Deluxe version for the 2 hours of music, not to mention the huge 8 player scenario Dragon's Throne.\n\nThe huge variety of units in the game, and the many different unit abilities and spells, provide for an awesome variety of strategy and tactics. The game is far more detailed than previous versions, and while the older games were great in their own right, AoW3 takes it to a whole new level. I can't go back to the old games anymore. It's a game you can get sucked into for many, many hours of your life.\n\nThe two expansion packs - Golden Realms and Eternal Lords - are real expansions, not shallow cash grabbing DLCs like in many games these days. They add a lot of real content, not just new races and campaigns, but many new rules and game mechanics.\n\nI highly recommend this game, one of the best 4X games ever in my opinion.","April 16, 2015","true","124.3"," 205 of 218 people (94%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","94","205","218","8","4"

I have a feeling that in 15 years or so I will still be playing Age of Wonders 3. I make this prediction because once in a while I still  play the original AoW and it came out in 1999. So unless they come out with an AoW4 or standalone expansion that is even better in every aspect I think this game will stay on my computer and my next computer and the VR headset after... a long time.\n\nMy favorite part of AoW3 is its focus on tactical combat while still including all the 4 Xs (explore, expand, exploit, exterminate) plus RPG elements. There are cities to form into an empire, heroes to level up, spells to research, dungeons to loot, resources to manage, etc... On top of it all players are engaged in battles early and often. The battles are killer fun tactical experiences that take place on their own maps separate from the primary strategy map. When a hex is attacked on the strategy map the armies/stacks in that hex and all neighboring hexes get pulled into the tactical battle. This means there could be 42 units (7 hexes x 6 units/hex) in the same battle and they could even belong to several different players! The combat mechanics like attacks of opportunity, flanking, guarding, and 3 action points to use for movement, multiple attacks, or multiple reactions are very well done. When playing single player I almost always choose to fight each battle manually because they are so much fun, but there is an option to automatically resolve them if you wish.\n\nThe only bad thing I can say about AoW3 is that it feels like the morale systems need to be flushed out a little more. My wish for morale is that your starting/ruling race should have more influence on the morale of your cities and units and diplomatic relations with independent cities. It was important in past AoW games. These things will probably get improved with some patches, and should not stop anyone from buying the game. *** This review is based on the BETA version of the game. ***\n\nThere was a period of years where I played a lot of Civ4 and some Civ5. Eventually I found myself thinking - I wish there was more action in these games and battles were more realistic like... Age of Wonders. Before AoW3 was announced, I searched for recent games with gameplay similar to AoW but nothing seemed to be on the same level. Warlock was too simple and too Civ-y... Total War just didn't draw me in... Others didn't even look worth buying. Age of Wonders seems to fill a special niche that no others do.\n\nI was fortunate enough to be let into the beta for AoW3, and I must say that Triumph Studios has outdone themselves even in the beta version. AoW3 takes many of the best parts of its predecessors plus some new goodness to create a masterpiece of the TBS/4X genre.\n\nedit: Forgot to mention one of the things that makes AoW games so replayable - the races. Past AoW games had at least 12 races, but AoW3 is releasing with 6 which is a little disappointing at first glance. However, this is made up by the new class system which did not exist in previous AoW games. The developers have done an amazing job making both race and class matter. An elven archdruid feels different than a draconian archdruid or an elven warlord. Thus, instead of having simply 12 races to choose from you have 36 race/class combos (6 races x 6 classes). There are also specializations/spheres that further customize your leader and playing experience, similar to previous AoW games. I expect more races to be added in DLC or an expansion and am fine with that.","March 26, 2014","true","98.7"," 403 of 467 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","403","467","0","15"

It always feels like something is lost when a great game from years ago is brought into the modern age. Things get prettier, bigger, and more streamlined, but many times it feels like some essential chemistry is lost. Some of us blame nostalgia, others simply write the developers off as appealing to the largest audience or the lowest common denominator. Sequels always lose something.\n\nWhich is why Triumph Studios had no right to produce such a perfect game.\n\nThis is the perfect sparkling bouquet of what made the original great, combined with the streamlined production quality we've come to expect from a quality modern game. It's asymmetrical and unfair in the most balanced ways possible. Whether you're outfitting your heroes or designing your player class, you'll find great satisfaction in trying to break the game. You'll be very good at some things, and very bad at others, but it will always make sense and it will always feel right.\n\nThe unit design deserves special mention. Each unit is deeply well-crafted and unique, even when comparing racial units of the same role. The attention to synergy is unmatched, both between units of the same race and in the way that race and class combine to make a whole. Leveling up often provides interesting new abilities that also tend to synergize, instead of simply providing better stats.\n\nThis game has a lot of everything, and all of it affects everything else. You'll build cities, research and cast spells, and train units. You'll command armies on the beautiful strategic map, and when you explore dungeons or fight another army, you'll go down to fight on equally beautiful tilesets. Tactical combat is reasonably simple but very deep. This game has not been casualized. The A.I. is maddeningly clever, and you won't take this statement seriously until you've experienced it. You'll fight skirmishes in the woods with bandits, and you'll fight in truly massive sieges to conquer cities. Your heroes will explore dungeons, find and equip items, and lead your armies into battle.\n\nYou will build your strategy, and then get excited about other strategies you think could work. They probably will. Your race, your class, and your specializations all fundamentally change the way you need to approach the game. It takes a long time to bloom into a full understanding of how the various parts of the game work together, but the journey is pleasant, and you can absorb it by playing.\n\nThe campaign probably deserves it's own review. It's gloriously cheesy golden-age high fantasy. The campaign follows branching questlines, so you can end up doing different missions. The base game has two campaigns of eight missions. Eight does not sound like a lot but you can easily spend an entire day playing one mission. They're huge. Think of them more like chapters. The expansion packs can add another two campaigns.\n\nThere are also a number of scenarios which are like competitive missions for X players. The "real" Age of Wonders though is in the procedurally generated random map mode, where you can fight other players or the AI. There are a huge number of random features on the maps, such as "dwellings" where you can purchase units from a non-player faction like Giants or Pixies. You'll need to play many games before you've seen everything you can find. Also of note, Age of Wonders has an underground map, full of caves, tunnels, and the cities of the Goblins and Dwarves.\n\nTriumph is confident enough in the mastery of their game to give the player enormous freedoms to explore how to play. Their own mastery is evident in the careful design of how every element acts together. If you find anything this game does interesting, play it for that reason, but be prepared to fall in love with the rest.\n\nThis is what a strategy game should be.\n\n10/10","September 17, 2015","true","387.0"," 173 of 185 people (94%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","94","173","185","8","1"

No poor low resolution console port, plenty of game options, and loads key bind customization to be found. Performance is a dream and the game is beautiful whether raiding dungeons relieving dragons of their loot or sacking major cities, and doing so right outside their gates seeing the city itself in all it's 3d model glory on the battlefield.\n\nOne of the greatest PC games of all time. More factions and content to come via expansions.

"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198079336898/recommended/226840/","76561198079336898","Donuts StrongJaw","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198079336898/","103 products in account","Let me preface this by saying that AoWIII is a very polished game; it looks quite nice, has few glitches, and it seems like the Devs put a lot of thought and work into this game.\n\nHowever, I cannot recomend it. Why? It's simply not an enjoyable experience for me. Now, don't get me wrong: I've always been fond of TBS games. I loved Civs 3-5, and have played quite a bit of Fallen Enchantress, as well as some Galactic Civilizations. I'm acquainted with the genre, but am by no means an aficionado.\n\nSo, why don't I enjoy this game? Well, a large part of stems from how narrow your in-game options are. There are plenty of choices between class and race, and those choices feel significant enough, really, but once you actually start playing the game, you realize that there's really only one way to win: expansion and conquest. I knew going in that this game would be more heavily conflict oriented, but to the point where that's the only means of victory? Not exactly what I had in mind, though I can certainly get by with that.\n\nBut it's not just that you'll have to go to war to win. It's more holistic than that: everything in this game is about conquest. The only real purpose of your cities is to produce soldiers, in some form or fashion. You build buildings to unlock units to fight wars. You conduct research to unlock units to fight wars. You manufacture "merchandise" to fund your wars. You "build housing" to increase your domain to capture "resource nodes" (that only provide a slight buff to production rather than serving as actual resources) to more quickly produce units to...wait for it...fight wars. Now, fighting wars isn't necessarily a bad thing. The combat is very well designed and has a good deal of depth to it, especially when you take into account the racial and class distinctions. But, this generally superior combat seems to come at the cost of the depth of everything else.\n\nAnd that's just the problem: this game lacks depth. There is no real economy management, no real resources to capture (the only two "currencies" are gold and mana, the former of which is over abundant and the latter of which is often too scarce), and no real tech tree to navigate. You just plop your identical cities down to increase you GPT to support a bigger army. There's nothing else to it. You don't have to worry about acquiring special resources or developing advanced industry to train particularly powerful units, you just unlock them via research. And you can complete that research very quickly (late game starts at around turn 50 in a standard game, though the overall pacing can be sped up/slowed down during setup). By the time you've done that, you've rendered most every other standard unit in the game obsolete. You can really spam your way to victory against the AI (assuming they're not doing the same; otherwise you just get caught in a gridlock). And so, you lose that depth again.\n\nIf you love TBS combat, you'll probably enjoy this game. If you're looking for something more well-rounded, consider picking it up on sale. If you're expecting something akin to Civ V, check out GalCiv III (maybe; it's really expensive and still early access).\n\nADDENDUM 1: Since patch 1.093 (I think), pacing has been slightly improved through the addition of new production-related buildings and other changes. However, there have been no major changes made to the other mechanics, so, take it for what you will. Mana has been capped as well, which helps to prevent surpluses. T4 spam is still prevalent, though it occurs about 20 turns later for non-summoning classes.\n\nADDENDUM 2: Since patch 1.12 (or something, I dunno), different races have received different buffs/nerfs, and different gamespeeds have been added. This does indeed help with pacing, and provides more strategic depth to the potentially longer early/mid-game. However, economy and diplomacy are still pitifully simplistic, meaning that my core issues with the game (the near single-minded focus on combat) remain. The late-game is still shallow, even when opponents are on fairly even footing.\n\nADDENDUM 3: A new expansion has been announced, Golden Realms (I guess? Heck if I know.), that adds a new shorter campaign and race. It's Halflings, and it's only three episodes long, compared to Vanilla's 6? So, basically, it's half-sized, just for the Halflings. It's pretty clever. More importantly, (to me, anyway), it's supposed to bring a lot more to the table in regards to empire management, like special, competitive city projects, new, powerful effects for "special tiles" like treasure sites, and exclusive racial defensive improvements. A new victory condition has been added, as well. Unsure as to what they'll be doing with diplomacy. Iffy on the price, too. Something to think about, though.\n\nADDENDUM 4: Golden Realms is out and it can be yours for a cool ten dollars. If you're American. Not quite sure about the pricing in other regions, as Steam doesn't do direct conversions. I've played a teensy, tiny amount of the new campaign but, to be honest, I really couldn't get back into it. Diplomacy has been upgraded (for free) as well, as part of patch 2.4 (I never get these right). It's an improvement, but you simply won't see specialized treaties or tech trading a la Fallen Enchantress or Endless Legend. No manipulating multi-national councils, either, even though they exist per in-game lore.\n\nADDENDUM THE LAST: Late to the party, but that Necromancy expac, Eternal Lords, released and, if you're willing to drop whatever they're asking for on it (~$20 up front, less on sale), the game definitely becomes robust enough to where I can call it a worthy 4X title. The new Necromancer class does a good job of shaking things up (as most necro-oriented civs do), and the new races (Tigrans and Frostlings, both returning from previous AoW titles) are surprisingly distinct from each other and the rest of the cast as far as units and aesthetics are concerned. Diplomacy received a hefty overhaul, with the inclusion of a new racial diplomacy system and related victory conditions. Play nice with races and you can construct wonders cementing their allegiance, or somesuch. You also unlock various empire-wide policies in the process, which adds another layer to empire management. It's fairly simple, but the overall concept's a pretty novel approach to diplo.\n\nThe game's pretty much where I want it to be now, though you have to invest in it to get there. I'd say it's better than Endless Legend + DLC now, but that's just my opinion. I'm leaving the review as "not recommended" if only because most of the core problems in the review can only be alleviated with DLC. Unless the modding scene fixed that. Did I mention, they added workshop support. Pretty nifty.","April 3, 2014","false","88.6"," 757 of 1,024 people (74%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","74","757","1","5","77"

However I'm not an employee of Triumph Studios, only a community volunteer.\n- This review was written post Eternal Lords and 1.5 patch releases.\n\n\nAge of Wonders III is a turn based hex based fantasy 4x game that is a lot more combat focused compared to something like the Civilization series but also quite a bit more strategically and tactically involved than let's say Heroes of Might & Magic which can be both good or bad depending on your personal preferences.\n\n\nGameplay\n\nCompared to the previous games AoWIII retains most of the series' fundamentals but also iterates and adds to the formula.\n\nThe most notable change is the way yor faction is presented via the class system. Your research tree and unit roster are not only determined by spell school and starting race picks but by your leader class (warlords, sorcerer, archdruid, dreadnaught, etc.), starting race as well as specializations which are akin to the previous game's spell spheres and leader skills. Your base unit list is thus determined by the race of the towns you own as well as your chosen class.\n\nComparing it to AoWII the class system in a way separates the racial aspect of a faction from the  gameplay theme of it. For example, in AoW2 Elves were always Druids with nature themed units, Archons were always Theocrats with their religious and holy theme, Dwarves were Dreadnoughts due to their technological prowes, Orcs were Warlords with strong physical combatants and so on.\n\nThe AoWIII class system separates race and theme so Elves can be steampunk-ish technologists, Dwarves can wield druidic powers while Goblins can be religious crusaders. Thematically this allows you to create both stereotypical combinations (wizard elves) as well as some unusual ones (holy angelic goblins).\n\nGameplay wise the trio of race, class and specialization (additional mini tech trees) allows for a myriad of different play styles and strategies and a very diverse meta game which encourages experimentation and greately enhances replayability.\n\nEach class comes with a unique tech tree which consists of special class units which can have their own racial variations as well as a large number of combat or strategic spells and passive upgrades that enhance your empire as well as units.\n\n\nCustomization\n\nAoWIII features a leader creation process which allows for detailed aesthetic and gameplay customization. Visual options are akin to rpg games like Dragon Age allowing for changes to race, gender, clothing, accessories, hair style and color, skin color,  eyes, hats masks, postures, background scenery, portrait poses, coat of arms, etc.\n\nGameplay-wise the options include race, class and 3 slots for specializations that can be magic oriented or more mundane empire upgrades.\n\nGame settings include numerous tweaks to the random map generator like map type (land, continents, islands), map size (s, m, l, xl), geographical settings (types of terrain and climate, existence of the underground layer), starting town/army, amount of resources, treasure sites, independent monsters, etc.\n\nFurthermore various game parameters can be tweaked like the number of heroes, hero level cap, hero race, game pace, starting resources, turn progression (classic i-go-you-go or simultanious), empire quests, map events, victory conditions, type and number of opponents, preference for manual or auto-combat and so on.\n\nMuch effort was made to cater to different preferences and play styles.\n\n\nCombat\n\nLike in Heroes of Might & Magic for example, combat in AoWIII happens on a separate tactical map that is derived from the participating units' position on the strategic map. If the units were standing on a snowy arctic hex the tactical map will also have snow on it for example. Same with forests, swamps, etc. Not only that but various sites like cities, farms, dungeons, mines, tombs, etc. are all represented on the tactical map and can have different effects like providing obstacles, choke points, magical effects and so on.\n\nCompared to AoWII combat in AoWIII has less randomness and is more dependent on the player making the right moves. Attacks will always hit for example (except under special circumstances) but the damage can still vary and there is the possibility of criticals or fumbles.\n\nThere are many things to keep an eye on in combat like move points (usually the less you have the less attacks you get but not always), limited retaliations, defensive stances, attacks of opportunity, flanking attacks, distances, unit position and facing, range, the presence of obstacles or city walls, types of movement (walking, floating, flying) and so on.\n\nAnd this is without taking into account unit stats (physical attack vs. defence, magical/elemental attack vs. resistance), traits, special abilities, morale (which influences critical chance), combat spells, unit and battlefield enchantments, unit types, etc.\n\nThe basics of combat are simple. Click on a unit, right click to attack an enemy unit. But is the enemy unit far enough to trigger the charge ability, can I flank it, what's the chance of my special effect triggering, what elemental protections does it have, how many retaliations does it have remaining, does it have first strike, is it a polearm unit and will my cavalry take extra damage, can I weaken it prior to attack and how, can I kill it, will my unit survive the next turn after it attacks...there are many questions you could end up asking yourself.\n\nLearning about the units, what abilities they have and how they can be used and combined for maximum effectiveness is necessary for mastering the game but learning can be achieved in gradual steps.\n\nAoWIII retains the adjacency rule of previous games so all armies that are adjacent to the hex being attacked will also participate in combat which can result in some pretty large battles. Thankfully animation speed in battle can be adjusted during combat.\n\nUnits and heroes that perform well and survive will accumulate experience points and become stronger acquiring new abilities as they level up and grow into valued veterans.\n\n\nStrategy\n\nOn the strategic level you build up your empire by settling or capturing new cities and expanding your borders in order to bring more and more resources under your control. There are resource sites to be captured, treasure sites to be explored, artifacts to be found, neutral creatures, cities and enemy leaders to be subdued. All in all the world is a dangerous place and venturing forth requires combat worthy armies and leaders. Luckily there is a beautiful cloth map to be zoomed out to in order to get an overview of the situation.\n\nResource gathering and exploration primarily serve the goal of building up armies that can defeat the dangers that lie beyond your borders.\n\nA new addition here compared to AoWII are the creature dwellings which function as minor races that offer unique units for hire as well as their own sets of buildings. These dwellings can expand your unit roster and provide unexpected tactical  and strategic options.\n\nBoth creature dwellings and independent cities can be outright conqured or negotiated with towards peaceful annexation by vooing them with money or performing quests. How you treat various towns and races can determine their attitude towards you as well as your alignment and diplomatic relations.\n\nAnother addition is that clearing out and controlling certain treasure sites can unlock special unit or town upgrades in cities controlling those sites which can make some cities more valuable than others.\n\n\nAll in all after 618 hrs of playing I have not yet experienced everything this game has to offer, so many untried combinations and strategies, which is probably the biggest endorsement I can give.","April 20, 2015","true","652.4"," 67 of 71 people (94%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","94","67","71","2","2"

(To be honest, I also love Heroes 5)\n\nLook at the DLC tabs and you'll only see 3. Incredible, isn't it? Only 3, developers must be lazy. No, you're wrong. These DLCs, except "Deluxe Edition", are big. They're more like "Expansion Packs", if you're a good ol' RTS player you'd know what they are (Remember Warcraft 3's Frozen Throne? That is an expansion pack!"). I'm actually impressed about this, great job on it, developers!\n\nMany other reviewers mention the "Random Map"  system and how great it is. Yeah, I admit, it's not really that very customizable by itself, but it's great nonetheless. I can imagine it being overly-complex if it was a lot more customizable anyway. And if you don't like random maps, well, there's always scenarios, community maps and so on.\n\nThat's right, for a turn-based strategy, there's actually a workshop, and it's not a "CSGO-style" or "Voteshop" workshop, where, if you want an item to be in the game, it can be as long as it gets a lot of votes. Right now, the SDK offers a good enough freedom, but I heard that it will be better on the next updates.\n\nAlso, aren't you tired of stupid, useless hotfix patches and so on? Make a hotfix, break another thing, a hotfix again, blahblahblah (NOTE: I'm not talking badly about developers who do it, there is always a bug after a patch and a hotfix may be necessary, but when there's a small patch for something so simple, useless or just decorative with no necessary bugfixes, yeah, I'm sure you know what I mean) and BOOM you may just lose interest. Luckily, AoW3 goes the Good Ol' style; only make patches when fully tested and necessary.\n\nBy the way, this may not be of high interest since not everyone is an audiophile (personal note: I tend to hate music), but the Music? This is music made by Michiel van den Bos. Name might mean something, name might mean nothing. I'll just say that if you listened to Unreal music and Overlord music AND you loved it, you WILL LOVE the music in AoWIII.

Indeed, conquering a fantasy world has never been more fun, and AoW creates beautiful situations and, thanks to the hero/civilization customizer, unique factions. Like technologically advanced elves, or druidic dwarfs. But the battles? The battles are really damn memorable, and can pin up 6 armies against each other (3vs3, or 18vs18 units). You will doing everything possible to not loose your most well trained units.\n\nAnother small, but very nice feature is that the custom heroes/civilizations you create can be used by the AI when playing a skirmish. Meaning you can meet Sauron, Tyrion or any other characters you created. (the heroes have some appearance customization options as well, though not too many)\n\nThe game will create memorable moments. Like the time when, while busy with my northern expansion, my kingdom of religious orcs was sheepishly invaded from the east by a distant (and so far peaceful) neighbour. After loosing a city, i mustered my entire armada and, like Russia on 90% Georgian sale day, invaded and conquered their entire kingdom in a matter of a few turns.\n\nBut this is were some might see a problem, and there are a few with this game:\n- AI is really not that good, not even on harder difficulties. it can stand it's own in battles, you might even loose a few if you're not careful, but the strategy map AI seems rather dumb;\n- "Classes" (aka civilizations) with a level-1 scout spell will have a massive advantage over other civs, since they will get a good scouting unit early and cheap;\n- Multiplayer does not have "Simultaneous Turns" options, which in PvP makes sense, since the battles need to take place, but it also makes Coop (players vs AI) almost impossible, unless you like waiting 6-7 minutes in the end-game for your buddy to take his turn;\n- zooming out to maximum displays a beautifully crafted map... that displays no borders unless the area is in your line of sigh (minor, personal, grudge). you'd think that, if X kingdom conquered Y city, word would reach my court, eventually.","May 5","true","60.2"," 56 of 64 people (88%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","88","56","64","5","1"

Orc civilians were rushing around, gathering belongings and fleeing their homes. On the horizon, six Ogres were marching forward. I had corralled every unit available in the area into the city, in a last-ditch effort to kill at least one or two of the foul creatures. The force consisted of 2 Musketmen, an Engineer, an Orc Priest and a Dread Monkey. None of those units could take a single Ogre on in a fight, but it was all we could muster. The plan was to force as many casualties on the Ogre's side, fighting them to the death, before our glorious leader came to avenge the fallen with his siege cannons and Juggernaut landships.\n\nI instructed the men to pour burning pitch made from Dragon Oil around the walls, in the hopes it would slow them down, and perhaps damage them further. Our leader cast a Mass Curse on the Ogres from across the world, using up all of his magical power for the time, which weakened their armor and resistance a little bit, but also, unwittingly, it seemed to drop their morale down from a high standing. The Ogres charged the city walls, and became immolated from the pitch. They yelled out in pain and anger, but all struck the walls with their fearsome clubs, shaking the very foundations. It seems the pitch wasn't enough to make these beasts think twice. I ordered the musketmen to fire down upon the beasts, and one fell in the initial volley, while the engineer handed one squad a set of freshly loaded muskets so they could fire again immediately.\n\nAnd then the Dread Monkeys began to fling their own excrement at these lumbering beasts. A foul, uncivilized tactic, but it proved to be too much for our would-be conquerors.\n\nThe Ogre it landed on stopped everything it was doing, and tried desperately to rub off all the filth. The stench was horrific. Nearby Ogres were so repulsed by it that they fumbled, barely damaging the walls they were attempting to tear down. The burning pitch continued to sear their flesh, as the Musketmen fired volley after volley at the hapless monsters. The monkeys danced around, giggling and chattering in glee. Before the dastardly cretins could fling more of their filth at the Ogres, there were none left. All that remained were the charred, punctured corpses of what was once an impressive invasion, and not one of my men had fallen.\n\n\nTL;DR version: Dread Monkeys fling poo at an invading force of Ogres and demoralised them just enough that my ragtag group of defenders held onto a key city instead of being absolutely slaughtered.\n\n10/10 would fling poo again.","October 4, 2015","true","56.7"," 54 of 61 people (89%) found this review helpful 51 people found this review funny","89","54","61","51","0"

There are a lot of supporting mechanics, such as spellcasting, flanking, and varying unit types and abilities, but what it all adds up to are tactical battles where you always have interesting choices to make. The battles are fun to watch unfold even after playing for hundreds of hours.\n\nThe game comes with two fairly long single player campaigns, a random map generator, and an editor that allows you to make your own maps, scenerios, and campaigns.\n\nMultiplayer works well, but unfortunately the tactical battles can cause things to grind to a halt. I don't recommend trying to play more than a one on one multiplayer game unless you and your opponent have entire days worth of free time. It's unfortunte since Endless Legend, another fantasy 4x, integrates tactical battles into the strategic layer nicely and supports multiple tactical battles at once, something Age of Wonders 3 can't manage.\n\nAoW3 also has PBEM mode, which I play a lot of. Unforuntately you can't control the player vs player battles in this mode, it's autoresolve only.\n\nOverall this is a great game. I also recommend the two expansion DLC that have been released.","May 31, 2015","true","372.3"," 43 of 45 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","43","45","0","0"

The franchise left some big shoes to fill when they released Age of Wonders: Shadow Magic 11 years ago, and Age of Wonders 3 fills them admirably.\n\nAt its core the Age of Wonders series are turn-based strategy games with turn-based strategic battles set in a fantasy world full of fantastic creatures and magic. You pick between different races, create your leader, build an empire and set out to claim the land as your own. You can forge alliances with other leaders (both AI or other players, if you play multiplayer matches) or try to conquer the world on your own. Your leader and hireable heroes are different to your main army in that they can level up and gain a plethora of new abilities and equippable items. Magic is an always-present factor in Age of Wonders. You constantly research new sorceries and in battle you will most often find yourself flinging powerful spells with your heroes while the rest of your army engages in more traditional combat, which also has its own nuances with line-of-sight penalties and flanking mechanics, on top of other things.\n\n\nAge of Wonders 3 stays true to the spirit of the previous titles while bringing new features to the table. The most game-changing feature is the introduction of classes. When you start a game you pick a leader, race, class and specialization. Each class gets many dedicated units that are restricted to this class only, for example Arch-druids can get hunters while Mages can summon wisps. The same is true for spells, a Warlord could get a spell that sends an enemy unit into a fit of rage, making it unable to tell friend from foe, while a Rogue might send a plague of brigands upon an enemy city.\n\nHere are some of the features you can expect:\n\n+ 6 playable races, all with their benefits and drawbacks (Draconian, Dwarves, High-Elves, Goblins, Humans, Orcs)\n+ Many different spells and units to research, depending on your chosen race, class and specialization\n+ Units can level up and gain increased stats, while heroes gain new abilities\n+ Neutral cities and dwellings that offer quests and access to unique units and items for your heroes\n+ 2 full campaigns serving as a tutorial\n+ Random map generator with a plethora of changeable settings to tailor maps to your liking\n+ 8 pre-built scenarios of varying sizes with their unique twists, for multiplayer as well as singleplayer\n+ Multiplayer with up to 8 players\n+ Ships with the same level editor the developers use\n\nIf you are into turn-based strategy games you owe it to yourself to at least take a closer look at Age of Wonders 3!","April 6, 2014","true","354.4"," 63 of 83 people (76%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","76","63","83","0","0"

Also I review the game with all DLCs so far (Necromancer was the last), but only the single layer part.\n\nThis game is really fantastic :) I have now almost 200 hours in gemeplay and still have not finished the last campaign (and not even started smaller maps or MP).\n\nPro\n+ Tactical fight is great. With the same stack of unit(s) you can either loose all or win with no loss. It's all about preparation and tactics.\n+ I like the storytelling and the voices are quite nice (especially the halfling hero)\n+ The maps are very different and made with much love\n+ Really overwhelming (in a good way) amount of units, monsters and heroes\n+ The ingame help is fantastic. Press F1 and simply search. With a few exceptions everthing is explained very good.\n+ The graphics lack detail and are kind of old, but very athmospheric\n+ I get bored easily, but this game suprises me even after 200 hours of gameplay with new units, new skills. new game concepts, races, monsters....\n+ 18 months after release there are still new DLCs with quite heavy modifications and also free updates with new game concepts\n\nCon (mostly only minor)\n- The UI just sows you two ros of skills for your hero. I discovered only in the last cmapaign that not more skills than 12 are shown. You cann access them with clicking on your heros portrait but I sure missed some before. This could be easily solved with pressing of alt and shift to swap between more skills. Developers?\n- not all things are explained in the ingame help. What is "weakness 5"?\n- Diplomacy is very basic and can be exploited by evil heroes (breaking peace = bonus points)\n- The necromancer seem to be not as balanced as the other classes. One of it's main features is reanimation of your troops, your hero or other troops. This can simply be stopeed by placing living units on top of an (un)dead stack\n\nIf you lke turn based exploring and combat and love good tactics, I really recommend this game to you.","September 12, 2015","true","204.6"," 34 of 40 people (85%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","85","34","40","6","0"

The negatives aren't all bashers, the positives aren't all fanboi's.  You'll get a good picture of what this game offers and where it is lacking.  This is my take.\n\nPro's:\nThe hex-7 combat. You can flank prior to engaging, but you may leave an army vulnerable to attack (it affects placement in the battlefield.. except against a city)\n\nThe hero "Leader" capabilities.  Each army (group of 6 units including hero) can have a hero as a leader.  Heros can pick from abilites to strenghten themselves or provide army-wide bonuses.\n\nThe Dreadnaught Class (while overall not high on my personal list) is really neat.  They are mech-based, rather than magic.  If you use their higher special units, you need other special units to heal them.  This matters most if your empire included multiple races.  Healers can't heal machines, and workers can't heal normal units.  I like that concept. :reusgreed:\n\nSpell options are "random" which helps split up the monogamy of game play (with a few exceptions).\n\nUnderground & above ground, + teleporters, water tunnels, and 6v6 "dungeons" with unique item (Strong, Epic, Legendary, and Mythical difficulties. :ghlol: )\n\nThe graphics.\n\nCon's:\n\nThe basic race & class units are carbon copies of each other.  Slight differenced being pure damge vs a resistance-based damage type)\n\nThe buildings are all exactly the same (except the T2 & T3 class buildings.. but the resource from them isn't a game changer).\n\nThe spell system is lacking, in comparison to Master of Magic.  There are obvious "winners" for large maps/games, which are to be avoided in smaller/shorter games.\n\nAs above, there are several abilities/spells which only have true functionally in MP... thus wastes a spell slot.\n\nAgain, as above, the spells are generated "randomly" based on your leader choices.  While not entirely bad (MoM was like that also), the MultiPlayer-biased or large map-biased abilities aren't balanced out of the choices.  Likewise, they don't recive more weight in those circumstances.\n\nSo that's really just one big one, split into 3 parts and the last being a pro & con.\n\n\n--------\nI've not gotten the xpac.. but that's supposed to add a few more nice things to the game.  Worth the expansion price? Not sure yet.  Next sale though.. ;)\n\nThere are a few things they could do differently, from a deisgn standpoint, but given the origins and overal gameplay..  It's definitely a good $20-30.00 game.  Not sure about $40-45 (not counting the expansion)\n\nApparently there is a bug that can crash and lose all of your data.  I haven't run into that one yet.  It does have occasional "lag" on the large + maps.\n\nI defenitely enjoy it, so far, I'm just a bit picky about things.\n--------\n\nWhat they could do to "fix" some of the holes in the game:\n\nMake a couple of "difficult" races, that are OP'd, but  cost more.\nMake a couple of "easy" races, that are weak, but fast to max out.\n\nMix up the complexity of the city structures.  Maybe Orcs only get a shrine, not a grand temple, etc... then balance it out other ways. (can tie into above)\n\nGet rid of the "Knowledge Points" resource.  It becomes 100% worthless at some point in the game. :angrytitan: Merge "Mana Income" and "Knowledge Points" and let the player balance the resource between the two. (mana income if dor spell upkeep, unit purchase, initial spell cast, etc..  Knowledge Points only go to how fast you research spells)\n\nUnbalance the spell system some more.  Let a Mastery level always yield a really bad@$$ unit and global power.\n\nWeigh out some of the spells that favor different game maps and MP vs SP.   There shouldn't be a clear "winner" for them, on that front. (These are in the Class-specific spells, regardless of your focuses, and the one focus realm of expansionisim.)  If a balance can't be reached easily.. simply making a counterpart (with a note on each as to what they favor) that is equally beneficial in the opposite playstyle is fine.","January 22, 2015","true","50.7"," 35 of 42 people (83%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","83","35","42","3","1"

You are probably right and do so immediately.\n\nFor a bit more detail:\n\nI'm not even more than 170 turns on a big map,I can already tell you that this is an awesome game.\n\nAt first I thought it was just going to be another 4x clone, which are also great, don't get me wrong, but it's a lot cooler than a lot of games I have played.\n\nThe thing that sets it apart to me is that IT'S DEEP.  And while production and exloration and exploitaing are still the core of the game, there are a LOT of other elements that you REALLY have to consider if you are going to win.  It's much less of a numbers game and a lot more of a strategy game like CHESS.  It is mainly an empire conquest game as well.  There IS diplomacy, but you best be prepared to back that up with force.  It's not really a builder game, but you can totally turtle up if you want to.  If you want to survive in the world you have to maintain your empire.  And thats' before you even meet other players on the max size map.\n\nFirst off, you have to create your game.  As per most 4x games, there are a ton of options.\n\nThere are at least 4 starting modes ranging from nothing but a city builder and a couple of military units, to having a fairly established state with big armies so you can go right to combat if you want!\n\nNext, you get to create your LEADER.  Your leader has a class, and a race. You can completely customize this leader just like an MMO or RPG. There are several classes and several races so that is a lot of options and there are both racial AND class bonuses.  All the classes are "rock paper scissors".  They all have different strengths and weakneeses and they are designed to be equal, if different.  I haven't confirmed how balanced they are yet.  But if you want voral bunny rabbits defending your city, Hobbit Druid has it!  In addition to that, you can style your charcter as you want, create your own flag and colors.  You get to choose 3 major abilities for your leader, such as the power to summon fire elementals out a pool of many!  You feel an imediate connection with the character.\n\nWhen you get in the game, it's EASY to pick up if you have any experience with a 4x game and even novices can probably figure it out if they click enough things and there are tool tips on everything.  It was very easy for me to pick up.\n\nThe maps are great looking, but the cool part is that there are Volcanic, plagues, frost, and I think a couple of more types of territory and the TERRITORIES are ALSO rock paper scissors for the RACES of your leader and heros, and this factors into the game.  If you send anti volcanic troops into volcanic territory they are going to be far less efficient because moral will be low.  Things matter in this game.\n\nAnother actually cool thing is that there AREN'T these giant research build trees to go through.  You can upgrade a city to max pretty quick in easy mode, which I am playing now in order to get a better handle on the game, but I'm sure the STRATEGY racks up quick.  There are like 3 levels for most abilites.  If you want to park your city and just produce mana you can do that.  Some units can fight on water.  Heroes can and do level up, and units can gain veterancy.\n\nBuild cues are kept to a maximum of 5 cue items, either research or unit production.  Yes, it means you will visit your cue more often, but it works in this game because there are less actual cities on the map with an even spread.  There aren't a lot of city upgrades, so you can blow through them pretty quick.  BUT each of them matter a LOT.  You have to research archers if you want archers.  If you want to build a weapn forge (which crafts actual items for your heros) you have to research it first as expected.  There were about maybe 15 unit types under the hobbit units. (give or take).\n\nArmies are also streamlined because you can only have a maxium of 6 units per army (at least in the game I am playing, not sure if you can change that, but I don't think so.  This is GOOD because you are far less concerned with how BIG your armies are, but WHERE they are and what units are in them!\n\nAnother thing is that each hero or your leader in the game has their own character sheet and as they gain levels you can spend points on any NUMBER of spells and abilities and you actually USE these abilities in combat!  There is ALSO a "diablo like" item page complete with a bag, and character outfitting, and you can send items from one hero to another.   The time it takes to do that is based on the distance of the heroes from each other.  So all the gear AND the spells make this hero or charcter very unique and deployable for specifc roles in an army.\n\nIN addition to that you have a SPELL BOOK which keeps each of the spell abilties of all of your heroes in combat and also GLOBAL spells that you can use to rain fire down units, or convert plague land to fertile forests for example.  You have to SHARE mana between the strategic spells and the close combat spells so it has to be managed wisely!  You learn spells by using research points (candles!) and there are many of them!  You can only cast a certain number of strategic spells per turn, depending on what they are.\n\nAlso, the spells are somewhat dictated by RACE and CLASS!  So the spellbook is different for each game.  But some classes are bad at magic and a lot less effectve with less options.  The Warlord class for example.  But they make up for that with better armor and weapons and archers.\n\nIn addition to your basic units that you produce, when you are successful Heros offer to join, and you can have them join you for a one time fee (I think all units have maintence fees, as expected).  Once a hero joins you, they get a character sheet EXACTLY like your Leader's charcater sheet.  Every hero you get is randomized based off race, class, and abilities so they are all UNIQUE.  Sometimes you can win a unit in battle, or a random unit to town will join you.\n\nThe map is filled wtih independants and non-player kingdoms.  They can be hostile or neutral.  If you try and conquer them, some will run but some will fight.  Best be prepared if you want  to win, but stay close enough to your cites or a dragon might blow through and mess up your day!  Sometimes there is an opportunity for them to run, and you can choose between killing them or letting them run.  If you let them run you get good alignment and if you kill them you get evil.  Yes, there are good and evil abilities available when you spec your leader and for your heros.\n\nSo basically, between the several terrain types, the rock paper scissors aspect of the heros and leader as well as chaning the compositon of each 6 unit army, you get BAZILLIONS of combinations, and all of the race units are themed for that race like the Hobbit Eagle Rider.  This means just a crazy amount of replayability.\n\nFinally, the COMBAT is VERY cool!  When you zoom in to the battle (IF you choose to manually fight it out) it's an area themed for the place it is.  I went in to one battle zone in a shrine and the objects decorating the shrine created obstacles that had to be worked around in the fight!  Terrain IN the fights is absolutely factors into game play.  Flanking and charging are ALSO part of the game.  If you have a hero on a mount you can charge into an enemy.  Each spellcaster can cast 1 spell per turn, so the combat really revolves around all those abilties you chose for your character.\n\nAnyway, it's all amazing.  If you like strategy games OR RPGS OR 4x genre games, you will very likely like this one.\n\nI see many hours of gaming awesomeness ahead.\n\n","October 31, 2015","true","375.4"," 27 of 30 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","27","30","0","0"

I consider myself well within the target market for AOW III, as I mostly play games along the RPG-Strategy spectrum.\n\nAs much as I hate to say it, I agree entirely with the top-rated negative review (by dacasonic). AOW III isn't bad, it just lacks depth. There are way too few units (really just one type of : light infantry, heavy, infantry, archer, cleric, light cavalry, heavy cavalry, trebuchet for everyone + 4 class units?), the research is one-dimensional (unlock a handful of units, terraforming and some spells), tactical spells are somewhat varied, but can't be used nearly enough and don't feel impactful due to a (in my opinion) mediocre resource system....\n\nIn essence, my biggest qualm with the game is how little there is to look forward to. In HOMM, I look forward to unlocking level 5 spells, top-tier creatures or upgrading my hero, because those things immediately feel impactful and rewarding. In Shogun II, I can't wait to get those hero samurais on the field or finish a massive citadel in a border city. In civilization, reaching milestones (wonders, key techs, even your first settler) feels bloody great and is immediately rewarding gameplay-wise. Even in Fallen Enchantress, a second-tier X4 game, upgrading towns, levelling heroes and reaching certain research milestones feel rather gratifying and makes the player want to go on "one more turn".\n\nThere is no equivalent in AOW III. Cities don't feel worth caring about (and it's a drag to keep them from getting overtaken by sneaky flying invaders). There are no great projects to feel excited about. Units are obtained early and the game turns into a variety-less grind within an hour of its start.\n\nMaybe the game could have been salvaged by a better hero progression and XP distribution system, to give the player something worth caring about.

I would get this game.\nWhile the genre probably could use a game to revolutionize it a bit, this game does enough new things to keep your interest if you are captivated by 4x genre.  You may be annoyed with some things here and there, but overall the balance is strong enough and they are working on improving the balance and adding more content to sink your teeth into.\n\nIf you are interested in fantasy lore, role-playing/story-making, primarily and racial interactions... I would get it on sale or wait.\nDo some research on the game first; if you find the lore interesting, purchase it if you haven't played any game in the genre or wait to see how the updates improve and add to the game in a few months.  Keep in mind you can also create some interesting quests with the map editor/maker.\n\nIf you haven't really played much strategy 4x fantasy games and are curious... I would get this game now or on sale.\nYour enjoyment of the game will be higher if you have an open-mind and like intricate game systems.\n\nIf you are looking for a fast-paced, mind-blowing, competitive game... do not purchase the game or do more research.  The pacing is similar to other strategic games like Civilization.  Also, there is nothing in here that will take your breath away, at least immediately.  The engagement relies on the stories and histories that are created from the complex systems and events that occur.\n\nOverall...\nAOW3 is a quality game that could use some improvements.  Fortunately, the developers care so improvements are on the way.  There  isn't too much else in the genre being made at the moment either and is better than its nearest fantasy-strategy competitors.  But feel free to check out games like Warlock, Fallen Enchantress, and Endless Legend as they offer slightly different fare if tactical combat is not entirely for you.","November 27, 2014","true","67.2"," 30 of 38 people (79%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","79","30","38","2","0"

The game is still super snowbally and overall, the mechanics still kill fun. I do, in fact, think the single player is alright now though.\n\nAgain, keep in mind that I'm going to focus on the multiplayer aspect only. I didn't play civ to play by myself, and neither did I buy this with that intent.\n\nOld content/Base game (This is now current 04/19/15):\n\nFirst, the positives:Tactical combat: This is what the game sells itself with. The concept, how it's designed is actually quite fun on its own. If you like Endless Legend's combat, you would like this.\n\nRace/Class combos: One of my favorite things for the longest time was the different race and class combos would actually cause you to play differently based on what race you put with what class. The developers have indeed succeeded in improving parity some in 1.5.\n\nMap generator: More often than not, I enjoyed the randomness, aside from predicible positioning of capitals. Powerful treasures, like production materials/scrolls are now guarded.\n\nDiverse Units: Units are diverse, and even units from the same class may have differences between races.\nNow for the bad.Balance: Dear god, balance. Heroes have always meant to be powerful, and that is fine. But the majority of experiences players you meet will use heroes as spell casters. This doesn't sound so bad, right? Well, spells, in tactical combat have infinite range. If your hero is on the battlefield, it can hit anything. Your leader can do it even if he/she isn't there for double cost. The majority of matchups will be determined by spells. If not that, you will see tactics such as run and heal. In short, play to the utmost efficiency.\n\nScouts/city mechanics: Scout wars are still annoying, and the flying ones are especially capable of taking cities, particularly the incorporeal ones. All units in any amount or strength are capable of burning any city in 2 turns, and any fort or watchtower instantly. I cannot emphasize this enough, the most central mechanic to continuing the game is the LEAST secure. This will turn your disadvantages into a landslide.\n\nThe community: The community has become somewhat insular now, as 90% or more of the lobbies are locked. Join a steam group or the forums to try and get in, don't try to meet people in lobbies.\n\nAutocombat: To be frank, to manually do every battle yourself is not feasible in this game in multiplayer. Unlike Endless legend, which is very fluid about its manual combat for the most part, manual combat in this game stops all other action for every player that is not in combat. You either get to watch or not depending on what the host decided before the game starts. So you have to use autocombat... except that the AI in autocombat tries to resolve things as quickly as possible by having both sides rush at each other, tactics be damned. Therefore the losses are always higher than they should be, and unless you've played for as long as I have, you shouldn't expect to accurately predict the results, which to my knowledge is not a common skill.\n\nFog of war: Once you initially explore the map, it shows everything happening except units. You see all changes and spell casting locations without vision if you're attentive. While this is a skill, it's not much of a fog.\nPatch 1.5:The new vassal system is actually pretty cool. You can now relinquish control of a city to the independents (vassalship is also the step before actually owning the city, too, so you can get it back). When you do this, the independents will pay you a portion of the total income and occasionally give you tributes ranging from resources to a small army (whose strength is based on the current size of the city). The vassal will also keep their city defended, which makes vassalship the answer to the player who lacks the ability to defend from silly things like wisp spam or something. It's not all good though. Much like burning a city, you can make a vassal out of any city in 2 turns no matter the size of the city, and after those two turns, the city will instantly spawn an army relative to the size of the city. Too much, too fast.\n\nGuard breaking: Now a thing.\n\nThe new race governing and race happiness system adds a bit of flavor to the game that causes the way you play to have an impact on the people in your empire, and thus affect you. Now, if you migrate for optimization, it doesn't just impact your (ignorable) alignment, you've made one race pretty happy, and really upset another one. Good luck making use of them when their units are starting out unhappy. I have nothing but good things to say about this system, although I haven't had the time to explore every option with every race.\n\nCosmic events: Adds random events to the game, which are mostly status modifiers. Some are positive, some are negative. Some only affect certain people. Some affect everyone. Fun in theory, but I find that I'm often annoyed by the results since it can cause damages to your empire through no fault of your own. The appearance of the boss drastically affects one person. The encounter is around legendary difficulty, and it roams the map. The items if you win are powerful, but I wouldn't lose a city temporarily or lose 4-5 units to secure it (in auto-combat). Overall, I think I would play with cosmic events off with other people to keep the frustration levels down for us all.\nExpansion content (yeah, I bought it to review):Necromancer is actually a rather nice addition to the game. It turns the class system a bit upside down because it has completely new mechanics added to the game (happiness and morale isn't a thing when you're dead, rushing causes your undead puppets to be destroyed instead, presumably because it's hard to rush and keep things safe, you also get population from killing things, which is kind of awesome). In practice, it plays a bit like a combination of theocrat (healing), sorcerer (supports are very important for more than just healing, and you get a decent spell selection), and warlord (with emphasis on debuffing rather than buffing, but you DO get some pretty nice battle enchantments like a warlord would).\n\nFrostlings: They play a bit like a combination of draconians and humans (I'm approximating), my two favorite races, so naturally I like them. They lose physical power in exchange for doing frost damage. Their pikemen are amazing (and tier 2). Love the race overall, but frozen flames (their support buff) will be op until it doesn't have fire resist (normally the race weakness), especially when used on frostling necromancer reanimators. (It also gives +2 fire/+2 ice damage to melee/range and inflict chilling, which is -20% ice resist/-1 defense.) Huge upsides in exchange for no healing.\n\nTigrans: Poor Tigrans. Has the exact same weaknesses as orc (with even less healing!) with almost none of the upsides. -1 resist, no healing except support once per fight self-heal, who then lose their range for the rest of the battle, low range damage on archers in exhange for bleeding (in fairness, units do more melee damage to bleeding units... but no healing). You need considerable skill to make use of their unique talents.\n\nHalflings: Fun little race. They scale a lot on unit happiness. They have -20% phys resist in exchange for Lucky. A mechanic that makes every offensive ability have a chance to miss them. Seems not worth it at first, but it includes spells and such, and actually net decreases incoming damage. They lack elemental damage though.\n\nSpecializations: Their themes are essentially chaotic magic, neutral good, neutral evil, and balance/anti-unnatural. They offer really nice tools that can offset racial and class weaknesses.\nLiterally out of space, so I hope I wrote enough to help you guys make your own impressions, guys.","October 28, 2014","false","645.8"," 267 of 452 people (59%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","59","267","452","18","39"

Coming from the Civilization series, I wasn't expecting a whole lot out of this game but I was pleasantly surprised. Age of Wonders III blends RPG and strategy mechanics together and creates a really unique experience. You can design your own character like in a real RPG game, deciding their look, race, and class which determines the types of units you can use and also the types of spells you can utilize and research (research spells instead of technology in this game). You get a massive Civilization-like map to build cities upon and explore and during combat you get to fight on a randomized map and do turn based combat with TONS of soldiers and hero units.\n\nYou can play Age of Wonders in a randomly generated scenario, campaign, or with friends in head to head multiplayer. Both of the campaigns for the game are very well done, have good voice actors, and compelling gameplay.\n\nThe only real turnoff for the game for those coming from other 4x strategy games is unlike games like Endless Space and/or Civilization, the only way to really win this game is through conquest.

Most fights come down to simply having stronger units but even if you have low tier units you can still sometimes win nearly impossible fights with a good mix of strategy and spells.\n\nIndividual battles can range from one unit vs one unit to massive wars that can take nearly an hour to complete. If you're impatient (and are sure of victory or defeat) you can also select the auto option which will measure your strength against your opponents and the computer will instantly dictate the winner of the fight.\n\nEach class rewards you with unique units and spells and each race also has specific units as well as its own strengths and weaknesses.  Some classes focus on mobility and ranged units, one focuses on spells and summoning, one focuses on resurrecting hoards of undead, one focuses on spying and debuffing, one focuses on healing and buffing, and the other simply conquers as much territory as they can to produce as many units as possible. On top of all that, when you make your hero you're also given a choice of specializations that even further customizes your spell choices and strengths/weaknesses. As you can see, this allows for nearly endless combinations of ways to play the game.

It is a mix of a few things actually, there is lite empire management (think Civilization), hero customization and - the main focus of the game - huge turn based tactical battles.\n\nFor a game of this kind it's refreshingly bug free, but there are some serious balance issues still. Nothing that can't be patched though. And even in the release state I had a real quality 40 hours of enjoyment with it already. It can only get even better from here on.\n\nIn the interest of full disclosure, here are the problems the game still has at the time of this review IMO:\n\n- Tier IV units are so much better than anything else, they make older units obsolete and the best tactic is rushing and spamming them. Also if you can't kill the enemy in time to prevent them from getting stacks of T IV units, you basically lost. If you have them, the battles lose their tactical depth. Just move forward and smash all opposition.\n- The heroes are super squishy and you instantly lose the game if they die (in the campaign, in custom maps they are still perma dead at least), which makes you not really want to use them, which is a shame because they are some of the most interesting units in the game\n- The economy is off, mana is practically limitless, gold is either no issue or a good sign that you'll lose within few turns if it becomes one\n- Little item variety, you'll quickly amass triple and quadruple copies of each item in your hero's inventory if you comb the map dilligently\n\n\n\n","April 9, 2014","true","41.6"," 17 of 20 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","17","20","0","0"

And is it worth it? Hell yes!\n\nThe graphics, soundtrack and (re)playability are excellent!\n\nAs the Devs are a small company from Holland, and independent publishers, they actively browse and reply on the official forums, making notes of bugs (although there are very few bugs at release) and planning on fixing them in future patches. The same is regarding balancing issues. They are very actively gathering balancing suggestions and also implementing them thorugh patches. They are very close to the community and that is something most software companies can learn from. Regular patches are already released and more are in the pipeline.\n\nThe game itself comes with an editor, so you can make your own maps/campaigns. Furthermore single-player options are two campaigns, about 8 scenarios and, the icing on the cake, a Random Map Generator. This generator makes very good maps with realistic landmasses. Maps can be selected for small to extra large size and 2-8 players.\nThere is also a multiplayer mode which supports Hotseat (players take turns on the same computer), LAN (need to make contact with official servers first, after that it's offline), VPN (in beta patch at the time of writing) and normal multiplayer games through the internet.\n\nI already netted 165 hours in the game, which was released just 16 days ago (at the time of writing) and I just cannot stop playing!

Now that I have that out of the way the detail that the developers have put in this game is pretty impressive.  Each individual unit makeup and descriptions are pretty well done as well pretty funny on some of the unit discriptions, similar to Warcraft humor.  The tactical combat is a pleasure to do even though there is a option for auto-resolve. I wouldn't suggest auto resolving too much unless your cut for time, and this game is not really made to be rushed and get it done game.  Like the old saying goes its good to smell the flowers sometimes and you should do this in this game because the animation and tactical combat is a thing of beautify.  The unit detail as you battle is so detailed I had to zoom all the way to appreciate the orc's armor and color scheme,  it's that good.\n\nYou can tell they put alot of love and effort in this game.  There is so so much detail besides the units makeup, terrain, heroes, etc. etc...  I just can't go thru all of it, it was pretty much worth my hard earn money.   Gameplay is very addictive and the story is interesting and keeped me involved.\n\nNow everything isn't perfect like when siege units break down walls.  Its hard to see from the animation that the wall was destroyed or not.  I keeped attacking the same wall because of it.  Only way I knew that the wall was destroyed was that I accidently moved a unit past the castle and it moved threw the wall.  Thats probably going to be patched since this is fairly a new game.  I am sure there are other bugs but nothing I have played so far that crashes the game.  Its pretty stable and the turns are rather quick after you finish your round.  I would say it takes few secs for the next round, thats really fast, which is pretty impressive compaired  to game like Rome Total War 2. It seemed like forever to wait for your next turn the Total War game.  Yes these two games are different but just trying to point out that turns are pretty quick and fluid in Age of Wonders 3.\n\nAll in all I would highly recommend this game to any turn base strategist and fantasy buff.  The intereface is so easy I believe it might attract a wider audience besides the aftermentioned gamers.  Yes, this will suck your time like no other.  I went straight 4 hours playing and didnt even notice the time go by, thats how enjoyable this game is.  Just smell the flower and trust me dont rush threw this flower bed or you will miss the beauty of this game.\n\nNOTE: I purchased the game and was not a Beta tester or a employee of them. lol","March 31, 2014","true","16.1"," 29 of 43 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","29","43","0","1"

Man, I am not disappointed.  Personally, it keeps my interest better than Civ V because of the unpredictable variance of the random maps.  I started playing the recommended campaign, but that was right when I got it, and needed to learn how to play this game.  I quickly switched to the random maps and have been having a blast with the curve balls this game throws at you.  I took over a dwelling of giants at one point and was carefully upkeeping it before producing a giant unit due to the expensive maintenence when suddenly a city on my outer borders got attacked by a very nasty undead dragon.  The dwellings are cool if you can take them over, but are fierce opponents.  If you take over or are joined by an independent city of another race, you can make units of that race.   Learning the game is an experience that increases its replayability.  At first I thought goblins were unfairly weak, but after playing other races, I learned some goblin units are pretty darn superior for their type.  You can basically play the way you want - if you want to be warlike, go ahead and invade and break treaties, or whatnot.  There are rewards for getting an evil alignment as well as good if you want to try more diplomatic methods such as doing quests to absorb cities.  I can't say much about the campaigns or the multiplayer at this point, as I am having too much fun with the random maps to try them yet.  I totally recommend this game if you like Civ games and myth-related turn based strategies.","May 4, 2014","true","133.9"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","14","16","0","0"

With over five hundred hours on record, and a healthy amount of those hours spent playing multiplayer with members of the Something Awful community, and most if not all the hidden things explored, I still find joy in loading this game up and taking a necromancer out for a spin as I turn the entire world into an open grave. I still find myself impressed by the swathe of modding content, adding more hours to the lifespan of this game.\n\nOn that note, it is worth emphasising, Please get the collection and not just the base game. Eternal Lords is worth the difference alone, while golden realms is also a really strong expansion. The Delux DLC is a nice bonus but the real prize is Eternal Lords. Necromancers are a very fun class but Tigrans and Frostlings are also great races to play as well.\n\nNow, lets discuss comparisons. This is not Civ, nor is it Endless Legend. In both of those games, you have a few other ways to win, you can play as an economic powerhouse who wins by driving everyone into a happy friendship circle. This is not how Age of Wonders 3 plays. War is here. War is how you win.\n\n* Drive your enemies leaders to their knees and take their thrones.\n* Find the seals of power, drive away the guardians and stand upon them, facing rival kingdoms and angry elementals until you master control of the place of power and turn it upon your foes in victory.\n* Unite races together and ignite beacons of unity, driving your enemies mad with envy as you prove your mastery of diplomacy by the sword as well as the tongue.\n\nYou do not win Age of Wonders by becoming king of treasure hill or cutting into other cultures like a knife, You win age of wonders by the sword and the spell. You will lead mighty armies of golems, backed by the might of goblin riflemen. Armies of high elf berserkers, howling furious challenge. Armies of frostling spellcasters, standing alongside summoned beasts. Armies of undead humans, still wielding spiritual fire even while bound to your dreadful will.\n\nHeroes will be at your command to be equipped by the prizes you rip from ancient tomb and bandit-infested farmstead. From swords to rings to mounts, all waiting to be claimed and lost when your rivals finally kill your promising champion and scatter their prizes to the wind.\n\nYou win in Age of Wonders in battle, and battle is what this game does very well. On this note I advise checking youtube for a few videos of the combat. Words don’t really capture it, nor do comparisons. Best to see for yourself.\n\nI think by this point I’ve said enough. There are other reviews that go into more technical details then I have, I am simply writing from a very bias place of love.\n\nThere are battles to be won, cities to be courted, inn’s to be explored, caves to be feared, lairs to be cleared, heroes to be leveled, heroes to regret losing, items to be won, armies to be lost, beacons to be lit, seals to be defended and grand spells to be cast.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/int19h/recommended/226840/","int19h","mad kitten","http://steamcommunity.com/id/int19h/","408 products in account","If you have played the past installments of the series, here's a brief overview. First of all, this is definitely AoW as we knew and loved it. Game mechanics is closer to AoW2/SM than it is to AoW1 - there are domains, you don't need siege units to take out walled cities (tho they help), lots of various buildings with a tree of what is needed for what, can build settlers and found cities etc. Overall I'd say changes to core mechanics compared to SM are relatively minor, and focus mainly on tactical combat, where we now have flanking and a more clear mechanics for ranged shots. All in all, if you liked AoW series, and especially AoW:SM, highly recommended. Personally, I still think AoW1 is the best of them all, but this one is still plenty of fun. Oh, and the soundtrack is awesome and very much reminiscent of the very first game.\n\nIf you haven't played AoW before, but remember the name "Master of Magic", then you can basically think of this as a remake of MoM. Again, if you liked that game, you will probably like this.\n\nIf neither of those ring a bell, the short way to describe this would be Civilization crossed with Heroes of Might and Magic, with some special uniqueness of its own.\n\nThe Civilization part is the global map where you capture and/or build cities, manage them to grow their population, build various buildings that improve growth/production/gold/mana/research or produce units, and research spells and special abilities. There's also a HoMM-esque aspect to it as the map is littered with loot and special gold/mana/research producing buildings, typically guarded by NPC mobs. However, unlike HoMM, the global gameplay is definitely geared more towards city management.\n\nWhen it comes to combat, you can either auto-resolve it, or go into tactical mode like HoMM. Now the big difference here is that, where HoMM is basically two armies of 6 unlimited stacks of units battling on a very small map lined against each other, in AoW you get the combat map produced out of the hex that's being attacked (on the global map), plus the six hexes surrounding it - and all the armies on them! Each army consists of up to 6 units (which CANNOT be stacked), and can technically belong to a different player, or independent mobs (some of which will fight each other). So you can have up to 42 independent units in combat, controlled by anywhere from 2 to 7 players, and with a large combat map which presents plenty of opportunity for maneuver - flanking, retreating to form a line etc are all very common here and have to be learned to fight efficiently, plus the terrain is full of buildings, trees and other obstacles that can be used as cover or to break up enemy line. Consequently, battles typically last longer than in HoMM, especially large city sieges, and are far more tactically challenging - superiority in numbers by no means ensures victory.\n\nAnother HoMM-like-but-better thing is hero and leader development. You get the usual system with hero classes, experience points accumulating from kills etc, invested into various skills and traits. There is inventory, too, to be filled by loot from various ruins after evicting their occupants.\n\nAll in all, this is a solid high fantasy 4X game that is rather engaging and a lot of fun.","April 2, 2014","true","43.7"," 14 of 17 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","14","17","0","1"

Truth be told, I agree with you there. But the game makes for it in THE BEST way by being 5x more in depth than Civ in combat. Civ combat has got to be one of the most boring things that have turned me away from the game. Purely, if I were to play it for economic, diplomatic, and technological victories then Civ would be my ideal game.\n\nHowever, let's be real here we want to fight. We want to see Elven Arrows blasting holy damage into undead and dealing critical damage that sends zombies flying. We want to see Frostling Mammoth charging into a line of human swordsmen and send them packing or frozen solid from wizard buffs.\n\nIsn't that more interesting then your typical "right click this group because hey scissors beats paper."\n\nThe hero customization is pretty damn interesting, while you maybe thinking: "There are only a few options in the beginning what are you talking about?" The true customization begins when you are leveling up on the campaign map where you can allocate stats, and new skills unlock the higher level you are. These are all incredibly unique.\n\nAND NOW THERE IS MODDING. So even if the core selling points didn't get you (Which if they didn't you've got quite a boring taste for video games, I'm sorry) The community has made re-skin mods, unleashed whole new races, created ridiculous legendary nits for your favorite races, and more.\n\nIf you're a fan of Age of Wonders, just get the game. I usually wait for it to be on sale to buy games anyway since 30$ is a little high, but it was worth it when I got it. If you're a fan of Civ games but want to take a break, THEN TAKE A BREAK. This game IS NOT CIV. It has MUCH higher emphasis on military campaigns and military strategy, and MUCH less on building/economic strategy that Civ excels at. Don't get me wrong, I understand why Civ is a success, but this game is NOT civ so stop comparing the two, lol.","March 7","true","196.4"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","0"

Shallow, at most.\nDo not expect a civ4 type of depth in this game. Expect a turn based Warcraft 3. Now let me explain.\n\nFirst thing, Town management lacks real depth, there simply isn't enough tiers of buildings to keep going. Eventually your towns become "perfect" and becomes a building of RTSes where the sole purpose of building a building is to create units.\nThis is very disturbing to immersive gameplay, coupled with the fact that it is very easy to sustain whole armies of troops without having to worry about anything, as long as upkeep stays positive. Works in Warcraft, not in games like this, especially when there aren't much choices when it comes to units.\n\nYes, I said it. Sure there are a lot of them, but since a lot of units are unique to class, unique to race et cetra, when it comes down to you making the choices, it all just fall down to "class of units", archers, infantry and so on. And how many varieties do I have for each of these classes? Usually just one. The choice spectrum becomes even narrower once you realize a lot of units are too underpowered/overpowered - balancing is a big issue here.\n\nResearch is so broken as well. Imagine a bunch of research-lab-type-of-buildings in a RTS. Now hide them inside cities, and put everything into a single UI. Plus make it seemingly random. Sounds confusing? Because it is. This becomes even more frustrating once you finish your whole research tree: All of your research points are now wasted from then on.\n\nPractically the only interesting thing you can do in this game is teraforming. To sum up; if you want a couple of hours span of gameplay each session this might be one for you. If you want a couple of dozens of hours of gameplay session, look else where.\n\n----------------------------------------------\n\nYes, of course, Xerberus86. Bringing in the "grown-up" factor really helps in a video game debate. I hope you are grown-up enough to get the sarcasm, in case you don't, it means you should realize that the games are games, and opinions are opinions. Different people have different opinions about game they played, and they end up with different thoughts. I thought I would share mine, so that people won't jump in making the same mistakes as I did.\n\nI agree on the point that combat is the main focus on the game, but as far as I am concerned, AoW3 failed to deliver anything new on the table. The combat felt mostly like downgraded version of that of King's Bounty, if you want the whole thing in a single sentence. Let me say it again. The units are poorly balanced, the unit pool have tendency to lack "valid" variety, and units simply pour out from cities in 1 turn making combat rather tedious than fun. Think how many times you rather auto-resolve because you can't be bothered, and end up with a dead hero for no reason, then have to reload to do it manually because you know that is ridiculous.\n\nPlus, repeating what I said about rather playing Civ or mentioning the fact that research "only gives you spells and researched bonuses", just proves my point. To add on that "rant", to see how lazy the game developers were, for example, Civ series have "future tech" research option, which keeps going forever, so that all the universities and observatories you built in cities doesn't go to waste. Not a function AoW3 has. In AoW3 if you over-shoot your research capacity you are left with the feeling you wasted a lot of turns building useless buildings that do you no good. Is this a sign of good game design? Well maybe for you, but for a "grown-up gamer" like me, not a chance.\n\nLastly, I am a gamer for around 20 years now, and I do find myself occasionally falling back to SNES to enjoy some timeless classics such as Chrono Trigger or Earthbound. Having a bit of history however, doesn't mean it can bypass all the criticism. The game is out on 2014, for fu-ks sake, and it should be reviewed as any game that is out on 2014. Not 10 years ago. Hope you keep up with your fan"boy"ing to this franchise, it really helps this franchise to stop improving from 10 years ago.","April 1, 2014","false","14.3"," 167 of 300 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","167","300","0","9"

A fantasy 4X strategy game is something that will always catch my eye though the genre has disappointed me quite frequently lately.  Fortunately, this particular one nearly flawlessly pulls off what I would expect and lived up to its potential.  This is a fantasy conquest game with a sizable helping of RPG that you don't want to miss.\n\nThe map aspect of the game is fairly simple, though it has enough to it to keep it interesting.  There are plenty of landmarks, cities, and dungeons scattered about and, usually, plenty of space for you to construct new cities and fortresses if you so choose.  Cities can be improved with buildings to assist in growing their populations, boosting their economies, enhancing their defenses, training units, and more.  Though empire management is nowhere near as deep as something akin to Civilization, I never found myself feeling as if anything additional was needed for this particular game.  It is, after all, a conquest game, not an empire builder.\n\nCombat, on the other hand, is where the game truly stands out.  Battles take place on a zoomed in map that is generated based on the features of the terrain being defended.  The turn-based tactical engagements can involve a large number of units and, at times, a single battle can take over twenty minutes.  The AI is no joke in this game and can provide a legitimate opponent which is a breath of fresh air.\n\nProgression for you units and heroes is also an exciting aspect of Age of Wonders III.  When a hero levels, they acquire five skill points that they can purchase skills with.  These skills are from a non-linear tree that is specific to their class.  When a unit levels, it generally gains only stat bonuses, though every unit in the game has at least one unique ability that it can acquire once the required experience has been gained.  The system offers a lot of customization for your hero builds but also manages to make leveling your non-unique units fun as well.\n\nPlaying one of the campaigns in the game offer unique goals and a decently written story, though, they do limit your power over the customization of your heroes.  You are supplied with several heroes that are characters within the story who will take turns acting as the 'leader' of your faction on certain maps.  It is an excellent way to get a grasp of the game and the differing races and classes in a way that dips your toes in slowly instead of hopping in head first.  Your heroes will also carry over from map to map giving them the opportunity to reach levels that would be hard to obtain in scenario play.\n\nWhen playing a scenario, you are able to design your leader from the ground up.  This includes they and their army's race, the hero's class and specializations, and even the appearance of your hero themselves.  There are a fairly significant number of each and you could spend all day deciding which combination you want to play with.  Do you want to play an orcish archdruid and have your melee powerful units complemented by summoned nature-themed units?  Or do you want to play an elven engineer who has their line of dangerous elven archers aided by cannons and musketeers?  The combinations are a lot of fun and the class specific units have different unit models for every race.\n\nIf you couldn't tell by this point, I am quite a fan of Age of Wonders III.  It successfully fills a void that I'd felt in my soul time after time playing the games that were 'inspired' by Master of Magic but couldn't quite hit the mark.  I highly recommend this game for turn-based strategy fans, especially those who are also fans of high fantasy.\n\nRaise your sword, ready your staff, load your musket, sharpen your claws and conquer these lands for yourself!","January 26","true","63.5"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

The music has changed in pace from being dreamy to driven synth orchestra... and boasts a great selection of tracks.  The digital soundtrack package included 36 tracks, plus all the cd case art.  If you are looking for a good strategy game by which you can take your own pace, dab into some light rpg elements, and team up with (or betray) a buddy... you have found it.  Previous fans should rejoice. Others, well, welcome to the club.  Oh yeah... don't forget the perks of the included map editor.","April 10, 2014","true","20.9"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

It's a fantasy turn-based civ-style game, which is not something you really see a lot of. The campaign leaves much to be desired, the gameplay isn't perfect, and sure, I'd like a little more from the customization options, but this game does a lot of things competently so I can't ask it to be perfect at everything. If you want just an rpg to customize characters, this isn't it. If you want your hero to also lead armies in your growing civilization in a fantasy world, this satisfies that. There's also a map/scenario editor. You'll have to look up how to do scripting if you want to be fancy with it, but the map editor itself is fairly easy and well-done.","October 9, 2014","true","50.8"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"

The game is a 4X similar to Civilization and Master of Magic, but it takes heavy cues from Heroes of Might and Magic in that the world is littered with goodies thrown about to plunder and neutral enemies guarding them, as well as customisable hero units that you can recruit and level. The best thing about it though, is the tactical battle system. This is nothing new, as Master of Magic, Heroes of Might and Magic, as well as the original Age of Wonders games, all did this a long time ago, but here it feels so refined. Terrain has a big impact, units have cool active and passive abilities, and the strategic choices that you make in battle all feel meaningful. On top of this, the game has great variety. Not only do you have a selection of races to choose, all with their own tech trees and units, but you also have character classes and traits to choose for your leader. Your leader's class and traits will determing what extra special units you can produce, as well as the spells you have access to. The combination of both race and class makes mixing and matching fun to do, and allows you to have much more variety if you get bored of a certain setup, yet still like certain elements of your previous games. The expansions are absolutely worth it if you enjoy the game already. The Necromancer class added by Eternal Lords is amazingly fun, and plays entirely differently than the other classes, with a much more agressive play style that emphasises growing your cities and armies through combat. Over all, Age of Wonders III is one of the best in the genre to date.","April 19, 2015","true","37.3"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","11","13","0","0"

I was worried in part by how it seemed as if your class defined the vast majority of your army but, having finally gotten the chance to play, all my fears from watching the previews have been quenched. This game feels exactly like AoW2/SM in all the right ways; next to nothing was removed mechanically and the new class and neutral city systems are simply additions, not replacements, to the old ways and they blend in perfectly.\n\nWhile it seems weird to review a game less than a day after having first played it, you should understand that I am the kind of gamer who will play a game I adore for only an hour per day when I'm "into it" and yet, with AoW3, I haven't been able to put it down. The sense of adventure and discovery I've found playing this game is unmatched, though I admit I'm looking at it through rose-coloured glasses. It really feels like a fresh take on the series, and the genre as a whole, without seeming too attached or too spiteful towards its predecessors.\n\nIt is not a flawless game by any means. I've found numerous graphic and sound bugs in the time I've been playing with some battle map terrain acquiring a strobe effect and a few attack sound effects simply missing in the ether. The map generator is still somewhat flawed, leaving a suspicious trail of grass along the edges of some maps and awkwardly placing patches of water in giant lava pools. My first encounter with an NPC in a match had me face to face with the character I had just created minutes before and was currently playing, turning the war into what looked more like bickering twins. These issues to hinder on the immersion quite a bit and hopefully they will be patched in time but it's never enough to make the game any less fun. What DOES make the game less fun is how suicidal the AI is when trying to rely on auto-combat, which is mostly a problem in multiplayer as not using auto-combat takes up a lot of time from everyone involved.\n\nTactical combat is, in my opinion, far more intricate and engaging as any of the older titles. The simple addition of the flanking and defending mechanic, as well as the reworking of the accuracy systems, was enough to vastly increase the depth of the combat but the sheer number of new units and abilities added on top of what we're already used to is almost overwhelming and it makes combat much more surprising, adaptive and satisfying.\n\nThe reworked city system is a rather significant departure from the originals and is what leads many to believe it's taken too much inspiration from Civilization. Having played Civ 5 to death as well, I can say the change does feel more in line with Civilization than the previous Age of Wonders games but it's very unintrusive and comes with a purpose. Now you have to be careful about where and how you place your cities because their growth (and, by extension, they effectiveness) is inhibated by whatever borders surround them and the structures nearby have significant rewards attached whereas, in the older games, you would place cities as close as possible because more cities just meant more gold, no more thought involved. Here, cities hold a much more strategic purpose and can lead to epic battles fought over one mostly unimpressive city just because it has a structure you want in its domain. It's exciting and thought provoking and feels natural in the evolution of the series.\n\nOverall, I love this game. I don't think it's an easy game to get into but it's clearly a game made with their fans in mind and is completely unapologetic about that. If you ever felt the other Age of Wonders game appealed to you before, chances are you will love this new installment. As a child of the AoW era, I can honestly say this has turned out to be everything I have hoped for for the past 11 years.","April 1, 2014","true","120.6"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","0"

One of the big changes is the addition of a class system, each wizard chooses one of seven classes, and some of the classes take over the function of some of the old races (Dark Elves, Undead, Archons, Nomads), for example, Rogues build Shadows and Succubi and can do so for any race, and Necromancers can summon or build a lot of the iconic Undead units, as well as ghoul forms of normal racial units.\n\nEach of the seven Wizard Classes contain a variety of unique units and spells and can provide unique upgrades to their armies, each of the nine races has several unique units and a few generic units and can build class units for any class that commands them, in addition wizards can choose from several masteries similar to Spheres of Magic in AoW2 and Shadow Magic, each of which have their own spells and upgrades.\n\nNow with the recent surge of mods, it's also possible to customize your experience beyond what normal options allow, with mods that range from allowing custom wizards to wear any armor with any class, to more custom colors for wizards, to more powerful terraforming spells.\n\nThe game has a slightly greater focus on Hero Units than Shadow Magic did, but that can also be configured in settings if you don't like it. However your wizard doesn't have to sit around in a tower and will gain levels like heroes so it's usually a good idea to take it into fights.\n\nThe Building Selection is mostly just like in AoW 2 with the main focus of the game remaining on exploration and combat. Patches have added buildings based on resources within a city's domain with a variety of effects, such as unlocking special units, or increasing research speeds. A racial governance system has also been added that allows you to select one of two race wide bonuses with each upgrade.\nThe Diplomacy system is improved in many ways over Age of Wonders 2, but compared to games like Civilization 3 it still falls short, it's impossible to threaten and coerce other Wizards, and the AI is usually unwilling to participate in diplomacy unless it fully sets the terms.\n\nThere are a variety of game modes, including Play by Email. It's possible to play single player, and to my understanding local host multiplayer without creating a Triumph account, so it's not DRM, but be advised that in order to access all of the achievements and some multiplayer modes you may need to create an online account for some of the multiplayer. Multiplayer probably isn't the main reason you'd want to buy this anyway, but it's worth mentioning.\n\nOverall, I can't recommend this game enough, it's my all time favorite game,","April 20, 2015","true","203.3"," 13 of 17 people (76%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","76","13","17","3","0"

With Eternal Lords thrown into the mix. It just seems even better. This title has a laundry list of features, game modes, and more. Going through all the aspects of the game will take you easily more then a hundred hours to fully assimilate.\nTo break it down, Age of Wonders III is a mixture of Civ meets Masters of Magic. You will bring your spell-flinging champion into the fray against other champion leaders. The empire aspects compliment your hero. This 4X title has more of a focus on individual heroes and tactical combat. Ordering your troops around the map isn't enough in this title. You must command them in battle as well. While the combat is optional, to fully experience this title I would suggest it. Simply put Age of Wonders III: Eternal Lords is an impressive accomplishment. For such a small studio. Graphics, music, and design are all top notch here. The only true complaint one could form is the price. While it can be a bit pricey. You will be playing one map for hundreds of turns and then there is there multiplayer, The level editor, and more. Bang for your buck is guaranteed.

Ill start by saying that I own all the previous AOW games and have played them through many times.\n\nI dont like some of the differences but the game is still cool, and the devs are still working on it.\n\nThe sound tracks from the older versions were better, IMO.   Plus the lack of a customizable playlist that existed in all other AOW games bothered me.\n\nThe change from 8 to 6 units per army...  I cant say I liked that.\nFlying or floating units are no diffrent than any other now.   I understand why they changed it, but they didnt have to.\nThere is a huge gap in the power of the different teirs in 3.  Any lesser units are basically useless later.  In AOW1-2 even a tier 1 unit still had a chance to survive vs a tier 4.  Now? no way.  The power gap is too much.\nThe heroes in 3 are somewhat weaker.  Your armor and resists have a negligible effect.\nThe facing change that happens every time a unit is hit is really dumb.  Your heroes can be attacked from the rear several times because of it, it really makes your heroes feel useless when it happens and enemies always seem to focus on your heroes too.\n\nSeems that some broader game mechanics were reduced in favor of prettier graphics.  Such as the army size.\nCastle and tower walls are just graphics now.  They are pretty useless for slowing down the attackers and several times I felt that playing defence behind a wall was actually detrimental and did little to stop attacking forces.  In this regard I feel like a good defensivive strategy is a moot point.  In 1 and 2, seiging a walled city or tower was pretty difficult, as it should be.  AoW3 just has too may ways for units to circumvent or destroy the walls too easily.  I resorted to using the auto battle instead of torturing myself.\n\nMagic domains in aow 3 are also another moot point.  Your leader should not be able to use any magic outside it like it was in 1-2.  I feel like this magic domain mechanic is anti AOW, which has allways been about wizards and their domains and their armies being powerless outside of them unless the leader was physically present.\n\nIf you never played an AOW game before, then these flaws probably wont be noticable and I recommend it to you.\n\nBut if your like me, the differences and dumbed down mechanics from aow1-2 will make you not like this game as much as the originals and possibly even regret buyng it.  Ive tried playing through the campaigns twice now, and the story is interesting, but the gameplay turns me off and I get tired of it.","March 23, 2015","false","30.9"," 39 of 66 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","39","66","0","0"

I had high hopes for this title, as these types of games seem to be few and far between, especially when it come to the game raising the bar and setting a standard for its genre.  I wasn't disappointed at all.  Lets break it down:\n\nGraphics: 8\nGraphics had lots of detail, varied terrain types and meshes that blended well.\nMusic/Sound Effects/Voice acting 8.5\nHad a great musical score, character acting was top notch, sound effects and environmentals were good too.\n\nControls 8\nControls are actually good.  Small issue with some poorly placed, floating info boxes that interfere with selection choices for hero skills.\n\nGamplay 8\nThis could have been so much higher.\nThe good part is content: 2 campaigns, each with 2 different endings.  I have put about 50 hours into the first campaign finishing off both endings.  With still another campaign left, it seems there is alot of content to keep you immersed.  The game also features a multiplayer/co op multiplay option (and it aint "hotseat").  You can now finally battle it out, with or against your friends, in a 4x game turnbased strategy game.\nThe bad part is there are some issues.  I started the campaign on normal difficulty and after two or three maps I had to change the setting to easy.  On easy settings it got just as difficult and impossible to complete the last 2 maps without dying a couple dozen times and having to reload the game.  Multiplayer also has issue, infrequent game hangs, and the more frequent friend dropped from game issue.  However, the game allows you to continue with an ai friend or save the game and reload and have your friend rejoin.  Nothing gamebreaking, just a minor annoyance.\n\nOverall 8\n\nFinal thoughts\nTriumph Studio was very attentive and  helpful with any issues on launch day.  There are obvious issues that they have noted and promised a quick patch for.  I take it as a good sign if they start pumping out patches before DLC for their game.  There are also gamers who feel the game lacks customization of units or this and that.  I personally feel we have been flooded with sandbox type games, and it has become an expectation that we should be able to create our own game, with the game you give us.  You can create your own custom hero and there is a map maker/editor I have yet to mess with.  With all this to consider, the game doesn't lack, but as any game, can always be improved upon.  Let Triumph get on with the bug fixing, and be patient for the additional content that they promise to work on and deliver.  The game is complete as is and will most likely go down in history as a "classic".","April 6, 2014","true","198.7"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","0"

Though I loved Heroes of Might and Magic 1 to 4 I could never get used to the later version's interface but AOWIII improves on them greatly in almost all aspects. The one small issue with it is that the maps, at least in the Scenario's, do not seem quite as heavy on resources and independant enemies as HOM&M games but I guess this is because the game is trying to break away slightly here.\nI will also say, it's HARD! I like this but was continually getting my backside kicked until I realise how much effect terrain variations had on different troops types! I love this and it really distinguishes it from HOM&M games where morale was a simple mechanism. AOWIII brilliantly bridges the gap between HOM&M and a more traditional squad/unit-based wargame.\nThink of a cross between HOM&M and Warhammer and you are just about there :)","October 1, 2014","true","108.7"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

I had a lot of fun with this game but there are a few things you should know before buying it.\n\nThis game excel with its tactical combats and it does it very well.  And the game is developed as a war game and the developers made this game around this concept, and you should accept this game as it is, a war game, where you need to carefully maneuver your units on a battle field behind covers, flanking enemies, exploiting enemy's weakness (elemental, armour, speed etc), and the game does it really well, and the ai is also very well done which employ a variety of tactics and is challenging even on normal.\n\nNow about what this game isn't. It is not a sophisticated empire builder like Civilization. In fact, because the game is so build around the tactical combats, the designers want you to intelligently maneuver your troops tactically, that you simply cannot win by strategic planning alone. There are no super units that you can simply steam roll through your foes. There are no super spells that will wipe out an entire stack of enemy on the tactical map. It is even hard to win by economy alone because even with one city you can produce a quite powerful army, on standard map the resources are so aboundant that you simply cannot starve a city out.\n\nSome people criticize the game because it is not what they expected, a fantasy Civilization game, and you should accept this game as it is, a very well done tactical war game.\n\nI really love the presentation of this game, both the visual arts and music are full of imagination and epic. I did encounter a few freezes although they are relatively rare. I hope you enjoy this game as much as I do.","April 2, 2014","true","231.9"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

I haven't played the previous games in the series, and I'm not the most knowledgeable gamer when it comes to this genre as a whole. I've played a couple of games each in the Civilization and Total War franchises but not much else. In my non-expert view, AoW3 is a pretty good game, and I've had some fun with it.\n\nMost concepts will be familiar to anyone who ever played a similar game. Expand your empire by creating cities, construct buildings to improve things like economy and production, research new technologies, train armies, move them around the world map and then take direct control on the battlefield.\n\nAoW3 has a strong emphasis on combat, in fact every victory condition (at least in the campaign mode) is related to conquering your enemies, Total War style. There's no equivalent of Civ's peaceful victory conditions, however if you can create a diplomatic alliance with another faction, you are allowed to win together.\n\nThis isn't necessarily a complaint, because I like AoW3's battle system. The world map is divided into a hex grid, and each army stack can hold up to 6 units. When you attack, all the units in that hex and the 6 surrounding hexes, will be included in the battle. So the positioning of your armies becomes vital, and with a little tactical planning you can create a numerical advantage before the battle even begins.\n\nThe battlefield is where the game really comes to life for me, because of the fantasy theme. I love RPGs, so I really enjoyed the use of magic spells and supernatural creatures. There's an amazing variety of units in this game. Of course you've got the standard melee, cavalry and archer units, which function pretty much the same whether they are Human, Elf or Dwarf. But then you can have dragons that fly over castle walls, giants that just bash those walls down, unicorns can teleport behind an enemy, succubus can seduce an enemy to fight for you ... and so much more.\n\nYour generals can cast spells to damage or stun the enemy, buff or heal your troops. They can equip loot, better weapons, armour and rings for passive buffs or resistance to elemental damage. They can gain XP and level up where once again, there are dozens of abilities to choose from.\n\nThe enemy AI is easily the best I've seen in this genre. Playing on normal difficulty, I was frequently punished for my mistakes. If I leave a city undefended, the enemy will capture it. I actually learned the importance of flanking the enemy for bonus damage, by watching the AI constantly doing it to me.\n\nThis is also the first strategy game that I've played that has a scripted story. Elves and Humans are at war, you can play as either side, and each chapter takes place on a different map. The story branches half way through based on a decision made by the player, and leads to one of three different endings. Dialogue is a mixture of voiced and text. And I must mention that the music is fantastic.\n\nIt took me 52 hours to complete one side of the campaign. Some of that is because I screwed up the later missions so badly that I had to restart the map and try a different tactic, but still, its long enough to make a full price purchase easily worth it. During all that time I don't recall noticing any bugs (unless you count Goblin Beetle riders ;)).","June 1, 2014","true","106.1"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Omega_K2/recommended/226840/","Omega_K2","K2","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Omega_K2/","301 products in account","TL;DR: If you like a fantasy-themed, combat focused, round based X4 go get it. It's a very good game. The Golden Realms and Eternal Lords DLC are highly recommended as well.\n\nWhen I say this a combat focused X4 I mean it - this game is probably focused mostly on the eXpand and eXterminate aspects of the X4 genre. Don't expect any deep dipomacy or city building aspect, it mainly focuses on expanding your empire and overthrowing your enemy. While the addons add additional victory conditions, still the focus is mainly on combat, however it does this very well with an insane amount of depth.\n\nBattles are extremly strategic. Positioning and composition of your units matter a lot. Units can be flanked for extra damage, many units retaliate (fight back in melee) if they are attacked, or they do attacks of oppurnity on enemies that run past them. Ranged attacks deal damage depending on range and line of sight. Many units have active abilities often also reflecting the choice in your class (like dreadnaught class, for example engineers class units can reload other class units like cannons or muskeets that could otherwise only fire every two tactical rounds, all units only available to that class).\n\nThe whole element setup and unit-ability plays a huge role as well. If you defend your city with all archers (which deal physical damage) vs units that have high protection against physical damage, you'll have a hard time if you win at all. Casting spells here might save the day, since they could give your units elemental damage or lower the enemy resistance.\n\nObviously you want to mix up your units so that you a good chance of winning over attackers. When attacking a walled city, you probably want some way to finish off the defeners on the wall, either with spells or possibly with flying units or with units that can climb the walls. Or you choose to simply destroy the walls and then move in. Instead you use units who don't get a penality when shooting up the walls and simply shoot the defenders down. .\n\nCons:\n* AI, while probably the best I've faced in a RBS 4X so far, suffers from the same problem that it can get rather predictable after a while\n* End-game can be boring (usually turns into a steamroll/spam fest)\n* Diplomacy is very basic\n* Town management, while substantially improved with Golden Realms expansion, is rather basic\n\nPros:\n* runs very smooth (on my system)\n* visually fitting for the theme and overall very appealing\n* story and lore is integrated into the game and the classes/units feel very thematic\n* good music\n* game includes character customization for your heros\n* single player campaign while short is pretty good\n* random maps have a decent amount of settings to customize\n* AI is compared to other games very capable and can pose a threat (though of course, for a seasoned player you'll figure AI exploits eventually)\n* modding toolkit/support\n* classes play very differently and have their own flavour\n* races also play somewhat differently and come with their own flavour (and strengths/weaknesses)\n* specalizations allow you to further customize your playstyle\n* spell casting\n\nFantastic:\n* the class/race/specalization combinations make things highly varied (in particular to games like civ)\n* RPG deeply integrated - units can level up, the game contains hero which are fully levelable complete with skills and equipment (which can also be found in encounters on the map as well as crafted in cities)\n* tactical combat - this makes it possible to have very deep and tactical battles that can take a while. Unit placement, unit abilities, spell, everything matters","January 30","true","305.1"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

If you want a turn-based high-fantasy strategy game, look no further than AoW.\n\nHowever, I can say without a flinch that if you wanted to truly enjoy Age of Wonders, you should start with the earlier games. As good as this game is, it's nowhere near earlier instalments. No, this is not nostalgia kicking in, I'm actually playing Age of Wonders: Shadow Magic right now, and it has more races, more units (some will tell you AoW 3 has more units, but they'll omit the fact that a decent portion of them are literal copy-pastes).\n\nThe old games stick to a recognized lore, so you literally will not see Angel Goblins (I'm not kidding, they're called "exalted".. the struggle is real), Elvish trolls ("Warbreeds"), and other ridiculous units.\n\nBottom of line, this game is great for what it is, an attempt to revive a highly praised franchise, and although it falls short in many ways, it is still a good game for all it's worth. Fans of AoW will definitely like this entry, while newcomers may shy away from the bizarre setup.\n\nPlus, the developers are really trying to appease everyone, and they're constantly supporting and updating the game. They can literally cash in and make a new game with all the updates and DLC they've done, but they chose to support this already existing game. Triumph is no big studio, so this says a lot.\n\nThank you Triumph, this is a good game.

The fact that Triumph chose to keep hotseat multiplayer in the game means that it will likely have a place on my hard-drive for years to come.\nThe only things that I feel could be added to the game are more races, classes, units and spells...but who doesn't want that in any game thats enjoyable. Well done Triumph, I look forward to see what advancements you have in store for this very solid foundation.","March 31, 2014","true","432.6"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","2"

If you are looking for complex building or research options, vast diplomacy networks and interactions.. then this is not the game for you. But if you are looking for fantastic, highly tactical turn-based combat in a good fantasy setting then Age of Wonders 3 is going to satisfy your needs. The strategic map has great detail and a real sense of atmosphere (the music certainly helps out a lot in this endeavor), and there are plenty of combat maps that have a beautiful layout. Unfortunately, siege maps lack variation (you will be fighting on these the most) but beyond that this game does conquest incredibly well.\n\nClasses feel distinct and allow you to focus on your own playstyle, maps offer a lot of freedom and with two decent campaigns, scenarios and a good random map generator there is plenty for you to try out.\n\nFully detailed video review: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdKrgCj15sI","April 21, 2014","true","105.4"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

As i got older I still played it and it became one of my most beloved games. Now while I do have a biased point of view I will tell you this : AOW3 Feels so much like the original is frightening. It seems like Triumph decided to start with the original and flesh out what was good and shave off the bad. I feel that they did a fantastic job making this game exactly what it should be.\n\nThe overall gameplay makes you think that its a CIV knockoff but after playig it for some time I realized that its just similar, nothing more. I like the overall feel of the game and the only complaint I had was that the screen scrolling seemed quite clunky.\n\nI truly think they did a great job making the combat system emulate the original while giving it a unique feel that makes you want more. I'm excited that they kept commander (or leaders) in the game which nearly makes the game a turn based RPG. One of the best additions to this sequel is the ability to create a random map. While random maps are pretty standard now (or should be honestly) it brings a breath of longevity to the game.\n\nIf you enjoy turn based stragety games that are fun and have dynamic combat this is the game for you. I truly think you'll spend hours enjoying this game and exploring or conquering your own world!","March 31, 2014","true","27.9"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","11","16","0","0"

There's a launcher, but you -DO NOT HAVE TO USE IT.-  Phew, one bullet dodged, sort of.\n\nGet in game, looks nice.  Music is good.  Music...sounds familiar.  Hmmmmmmmm.  Start a campaign.

The voice acting is good so far, huge bonus.\n\nSo I start a campaign and pretty quickly you get into your first fight.  And then, holy ♥♥♥♥, Battle Macabre starts playing.

Most are of great quality but due to the length of some instances (late-game world map micro-managing or lengthy battle sequences with large armies), the themes can seem to reoccur too often too quickly.\n\n- Gameplay (Leader vurnability)\nWhile defeat could come easily in Age of Wonder 1 when your leader died to a stray spell, Age of Wonders II made them too persistant with next turn revives and respawning at any city with a Wizard's Tower. Age of wonders 3 perfects this balance by granting the leader some form of revival but at a decent cost. All in all: Leaders are neither vurnable nor near-unkillable like they were in previous games, striking the perfect balance where all tactics can be considered during play to eliminate your opponent.\n\nTHE BAD:\n\n- Graphics\nWhile city-scapes during sieges can look amazing and army units are decent enough, there are equal as unpolished or plain bad textures as well. The leaders & heroes are the main offenders here: hair, beards and sometimes armor clipping or looking translucent, clothes or armor clipping through mounts,... Customizing your own leader has been expanded upon graphically, which I can only commend but the sore lack of extensive options makes this but a tiny timewaster rather than anything worthwhile. I confess, this is far more important in an RPG than it is in a TBS, but it looks half-♥♥♥♥♥ nonetheless (example: No skin-tone for Dark Elves whilst the High Elves race is a mixture of both Wood Elves & Dark Elves). Furthermore, while some ingame items equipped to these heroes show up on their avatar and thus offers a nice nod to detail, other items do nothing of the sort. In my opinion, either do all or none of the items lest you create the notion you hadn't the time to bother with them all.\n\nSome flying units have issues as well when fighting over lava or water. If the unit in question has an idle stance where it lands itself until ordered, it gets submerged nearly completely in said lava or water. Creating another idle animation when fighting over water or lava could have provided a solution here, as of now it just gnaws at the player's experience.\n\n\n- Content\nAge of Wonders 1 had 12 playable races, Age of Wonders 2 had 15 playable races (12 in the original, 3 extra in the expansion), Age of Wonders 3 has 6 of these races. Not only a major plunge in what you can play, but all units feel much the same with different skins. Although each races varies slightly from the standard template (Dwarves have 1 extra defense & resistance but cost 10% more gold to recruit, Orcs suffers -1 ranged damage yet gain +1 melee damage, etc...), none feel as diverse as they were in previous games. While some units do have unique abilities (Elf Unicorn Riders pack the Phase-ability, unique to them), their stats are nearly equal apart from their racial modifier! To me, the varied stats seemed to have a far greater impact in previous installments, contributing to each race's unique style. The only units I currently feel that make a unique impact over its peers are the Orc Greatsword and the Elf Gryphon Rider due to enhanced stats or extra abilities.\n\nNext comes the story, spoiler tag inserted:\n\nEven though they try to take the story into a new direction, this game only contains 6 or 7 missions per campaign to explain it. Aside from being utterly uninspired with an ending that just oozes: BUY OUR EXPANSION SINCE THIS RESOLVES NOTHING; all of these missions fall into the same tedious category of: "Build a base from scratch against overwhelming enemy numbers who rarely do anything and sit there until you grind them piece by piece into a pulp." The last and fifth mission of the Elven campaign are notorious for this in my book. Aside from a few skirmishes into your terrain, they'll just wait until you come to besiege them. A few secrets here and there spruce up the lot, but they are far too minor to sit through hours & hours of same old empire building & grinding the foe to a pulp. Since nearly every mission is played with a different leader as well, don't count on transfering your researched spells over into the next scenario like you did in Age of Wonders 2! In my opinion, endless padding. The only plus was that it forced you to play with many of the classes the game has to offer, daring players to test all it has to offer, albeit not that much.\n\n\n- Multiplayer\nAs many posts on the Age of Wonder III tech support website indicates, a tremendous amount of players is having issues even making a connection to other players. I had this same issue until I disabled my McAfee software, the ONLY game I must do this for in order to play it online even when adding said game to the exceptions list. Even though the game forwards ports automaticly in the hopes to get a connection going for the owner, I still feel this is a nuissance that could have been avoided or handled in a better way than just stating "Your router must cause the issue, call your providers to sort it out!".\n\nWhen you're finally able to get this mode to work, the only feasible tactic to win the game under an hour is to rush your opponent to oblivion. I've played multiple team sessions and Free-For-Alls, all ended in either two scenario's. A: as stated before, players rushed eachother with their starting stack and hoped to have randomly received a summoning spell at the start of the game in order to crush their foe, quiting if they lost too many units along the way. B: People played passively for an hour and then quit the game due to a lack of intrest. In short: Play with friends so you can extend the game past the hour mark or fight it out until the bitter end. There is nothing satisfying about games ending abruptly because one felt it didn't go his or her way.\n\nVERDICT:\n\nI wanted this game to be good, I truly wished for this as I am a long-time fan of the series. I adored the previous games but with all the issues & disappointments I've encountered here, I cannot urge others to buy, let alone play it. A few more months to expand the content provided would have made this game a worthy addition but for me in its current state: It falls short.\n\nI've probably missed a few things here & there, but I hope my review helped you decide if this game is worth your time & money.","May 11, 2014","false","80.6"," 37 of 66 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","37","66","0","0"

Also has little skirmishes whenever you fight something, unlike CIV (You zoom into a little battle, which is entirely identical to DnD but digital). Less focused on economy and city management, more focused on combat, which is perfect for me. If you liked Civ but wanted more combat, buy this.\n\nGraphics are lovely, slightly more optomised than CIV. There are "Heros" which act as leaders, have extra spells and get an inventory in which to store loot (you get loot from raiding tombs, dungeons and ruins. Such as a musket, a staff, armour or a necklace). Theres a leveling system for all units, so fight with them and they increase in potency, which makes a good deal of effect on combat.

I really like that the developers chose the right path, they not only did not move towards contraction but instead they actually introduced lots of new features into the game, which was very risky in the first place, knowing how conservative are fans in such games like AOW, Disciples and HMM. But in reality, compared to Heroes of Might and Magic and especially Disciples, which both went the wrong direction, this game is a masterpiece.\n\nThe new added features make the game different on the one hand, but also more interesting. I do not want to compare this game to Age of Wonders II, which of course is a living classics, but I can tell that this game has set the bar very high. This is obvious when you look at everything - the picture is amazing, it creates an impression of a beautiful fantasy world - very often I stopped the game in order to look at the map, take a look at the river, mountains, forests, and to look at how my pocket kingdom is doing. The music is great, altough I always consider the Age of Wonders II contained the best soundtrack of all times in games, the compositions of Michiel van den Bos are very powerful, and are used when they are actually needed, very often giving an additional inspiration in difficult battles.\n\nI think the best argument which summarizes overall impression of the game is that there is always a wish to let the game go even when the map is already won. This is paradoxical on the one hand, because each map takes very long time to beat, but it was always a part of Age of Wonders gameplay, and compared to the previous games, in my opinion, it feels way faster. There are always so many things to do, do some research, build more buildings, recruit more units, build improvements, and to build new cities... So sometimes I regret that there is no single unified map like it is in Civilization, where you could develop a huge Empire and allow it to stand the test of time - this is perhaps the only bad thing about this game.\n\n\n8.5 / 10","October 27, 2015","true","137.2"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

This game is just a xenophobic sprint to tier 4 units.\n\nIf you sit back at all the AI will crush you. On normal, the AI has numerous bonuses to everything and starts to send steamroll armies at you while you are still trying to enjoy setting up your empire. If you want to progress then you have to rush as fast as possible, save often, and dump all hero points into defense.\n\nScenario is more of the same from an AI perspective. Diplomacy is pointless and random. The AI leaders remind me of Ralph Wiggum: "I'm HAPPY AND ANGRY".\n\nIn short, not a terrible game but there are better 4X games out there to spend my money and time on.","April 21, 2015","false","33.7"," 72 of 133 people (54%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","54","72","133","0","4"

It consists of two parts; strategic world map and turn-based battles. I'll briefly explain each one here. There's a campaign mode which is fun but my favourite part of the game is the random map which you can customize the hell out of. There's an incredible amount of options for you to customize your own skirmish game. You can have a very short one with a small map, with huge amounts of resources and starting with large armies, or you can have a large map with lots of civilizations, slow research times, few starting resources (and few resources on the map) and so forth. You can even customize the terrain if you want to take the time, so there are a lot of options to suit your fancy.\n\nYou'll choose a race (human, orc, goblin, elf, etc.) and a class (warlord, theocrat, dradnought, sorcerer, etc) for your civilization. Each race has specific strengths and weaknesses and each class is very very different. A warlord civilization for example are focused on strong conventional armies, a dreadnought civilizationis focused on industry and powerful siege engines, a sorcerer civilization is magic based and so on. Your starting hero (which is like a leader of your overall civ and can be used as a general in your armies) will determine the class of your civilization, so choosing a warlord hero will make your civilization a warlord civ, but you can recruit other heroes of other classes as the game progresses.\n\nWorld map - this part of the game is very much like Civilization V and is wonderfully simple and easy to learn. You'll begin with a settler (or a city depending on what options you chose to start with) and your settler will set up your first city, you can choose where. Cities produce gold, production and mana resources and you can build city upgrades and recruit units from them. There are resource structures on the map and if they are inside your city's borders then they give bonuses to gold, production, mana or research. Gold is used to build upgrades in your cities, recruit units and has some functions in diplomacy (yes there's diplomacy with independent cities and other civs), production is very simple - if your city is producing 20 production and a barracks takes 100 production to build, you'll build it in 5 turns. Mana is used to cast spells and knowledge works like production except it's used to research new spells/technologies. Your cities also produce population and grow from small villages to huge metropolises. There's happiness and allignment too - if a city is happy they will throw a party in honour of you which nets you some gold, and alignment is good and evil (and neutral) and is affected by things you do on the map, such as attacking independent cities or letting enemies run when they don't want to fight you. The strategic map is also quite beautiful. Think of it as Civilization V with a fantasy, Lord of the Rings-type feel to it.\n\nThe other part of the game is the battle map. You create your armies on the strategic map and when they meet enemies the game loads the battle map. The battle map is turn based and hex based with flanking penalties. You have a variety of units to command, each with very different skills (like necromancers that can raise the dead to fight for you and curse enemies) and your hero can cast spells that he/she has learned. It's all quite easy to learn but takes a bit of time to master.\n\nAs I said I think this game is underrated and it's definitely worth buying if you like 4X type games.","August 3, 2015","true","15.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","3"

It plays like a combination of Might & Magic and Civilization, however it differs significantly from the both of them.\n\nFirst off: do not be fooled, Civilization fans. If you're looking for a fantasy equivalent of Civilization, this isn't going to perfectly scratch that itch. While it does have highly customizable kingdoms (with races and themes to pick from - steampunk elves and druidic dwarves are both possible, for example), the kingdoms themselves serve no purpose except to produce combat units. There is no need to improve tiles, and while civilization happiness is a factor, it's generally not an issue unless enemy empires start using magic to lower happiness within your cities. The biggest thing that hampers it from being 'fantasy Civ' however, is that there is no tech tree and there are no victory conditions other than to defeat your enemies, or attempt to form an Alliance between them.\n\nThat said, if you were the sort of Civilization player who preferred scrapping with barbarian tribes and winning the game through domination of your enemies, this game may actually end up being a better alternative. It plays similarly to Civilization V, but it is entirely a wargame. It provides roaming bands of monsters to fight, and small dungeons to explore with your army and recover magical items to equip your heroes with. The independant cities (this game's version of City-States from Civ V) provide quests which can give magical item rewards, and can even reward you with joining your empire, giving you access to unique units such as fey and giants.\n\nThe game turns into a Might & Magic-esque tactical RPG when in combat, providing a large grid with terrain to utilize for cover and flanking. Might & Magic players should be happy with what is provided here, though they should keep in mind that battlefields are typically much larger than the chessboard-esque M&M battlefields. Army sizes are also typically much smaller, with most engagements having no more than six units on either side. Only city battles can exceed this limit.\n\nI highly recommend this game to M&M fans, fans of tactical RPGs, and fans of Civilization who enjoy the Domination victory condition. However, Civ players who enjoy nonviolent victory conditions should look elsewhere.","April 3, 2014","true","49.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","1"

The amount of tactical decisions to be made (terrain, movement, stats, buffs, debuffs, resistances etc.) combined with clever army builing is JUST RIGHT to let this game FLOW. In this regard, AOW3 succeeds where all the other titles (HoMM 4-6, Disciples, Fallen Enchantress) have failed miserably.\n\nCONTRA:\n- The Number 1 Mistake of new Players (and obviously the reason for a lot of bad tempered "reviews") is the misinterpretation of the way the units are represented (HP/DMG-wise). FOLKS ! The Number of 3d-Models in a Unit is JUST A REPRESENTATION of the Hitpoints - where low-tier units have i.e. 5 figures and high-tier units just one model..so: no, once the Orc Shock Trooper slot looses a model (HP) it does not inflict less damage. It's all a matter of interpretation.\nMy real Contra with this is that the devs did not consider the necessity of explaining this is in some sort of tutorial. It's 2014 and the kids are used to playing stupid crap where everything is chewed for them...what a good 4x game does is leaving some room for imagination, only visualizing what is necessary to establish the mood. But it's a sad fact that , in order to sell these concepts to the masses - you have to *educate* them a little bit\n- Diplomacy. Just plain boring. What i'm really missing is an AI that displays total irrational reactions (a goblin druid declaring war on you just because you captured his favoured neutral tavern; an allied dwarven theocrat who is a racist ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and breaks the alliance because you have chosen not to migrate the last town you captured to your heroes race...you got the idea.\nWhere everything else in TBS is about numbers and logic - diplomacy should be about lying, cheating, egos and taste - just like real world politics :)\n- The random Map Generator needs serious tweaking. There is some sort of "Mountain Spaming" on large map types with "underground" and even player numbers...very annoying.\n\nBottom Line:\n\nThere is always a lot of work to be done. Some Unit-Stats tweaking here, some AI-Polishing there. Regarding the overall game design, AOW3 does it right. There have been lots of discussions about the typical TBS issues: Balancing the time exposure / gameflow ratio; how to avoid the stack of doom, complexity vs. laid back indulgence. The fundamentals are here, they play very well and boy - do they look good. With some more effort, this will be the best fantasy-themed TBS-Game since the days of MoM...\n","April 24, 2014","true","77.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Combat is fun; a lot of depth lies in unit choice to compose units but actual combat feels insultingly shallow with most abilities being 'damage enemy' or 'heal ally'. Empire building is quite fun, the exploration aspect is wonderful, the hero level-up is fairly detailed. The create-a-character could use more options but it's par. The sounds, music, etc is good. Balance can be fairly topsy-turvy with most strategies being 'spam the ♥♥♥♥ out of your biggest units and butt♥♥♥♥ the enemy'. AI and Diplomacy need serious work -- very, very serious work. When your diplomacy system is actually worse than Civ 5 BNW's, you have an issue. All in all 8/10; you'll get anywhere from 10 to 40 hours out of it.","May 11, 2014","true","55.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

I love the introduction of RPG elements, meaning that you can design your leader, pick a race, a class, and your alignment changes depending on your actions in the game.\n\nI could write everything here, but it'd go on forever.

I bought my steam digital download version for 75PLN (about $25) and if you look online you can by it this cheap pretty much anywhere in the world. For this price you get a brand new game with 2 campaigns, each with 6 missions + 1 for alternative choices made. I would say this is easily 40 hours of gameplay, at least. Then you also have scenarios and endless possibilities with random map generator.\n\nThe game is complex, but easier to get into than the likes of Europa Universalis, Total War, or even Civilization series. At the same time it offers plenty to more seasoned TBS and 4X players. It's different than almost anything else on the market. People compare this game to HoM&M, Civ, and Total War, but while it includes elements of all these games, it's still something totally different.\n\nIf you enjoy 4X games, you should definitely try it. If you like TBSs in general you might want to give it a go. If all HoM&M titles after HoM&M 3 (and maybe 4) disappointed you, buy this game!\n\nFor anyone who likes Civ, Gal Civ, HoM&M series this should be a definitve buy. People who like Paradox games should also consider it.\n\nThe random map generator in this game is like nothing I have ever seen before. The number of options is mind blowing. You can customize the number of cities, their size, number of treasures, resource, visit structures, starting army sizes, and much more.\n\nThere's plenty of strategy involved and enough variety to keep you playing for many hours. 6 classes, 6 races, and 14 specializations to choose from means you get to try out new things almost every game.\n\nAnd finally, the multiplayer. I don't know how 4X games could have existed without simultaneous turns. I used to play some with classic turns and it was a thrill, but it also dragged on way too long and I would never play with strangers for this very reason. Here you can start a small map 1 vs 1 game with smallest starting cities and medium armies and finish it in about half an hour, it that's your cup of tee. You can still play epic large map games with mutiple opponents and save your sessions, in this case too, the simultaneous turns option will vastly speed up the game. I was worried about using this over the classic turns, but it works like a charm, I use it even against the AI, there's hardly any reason not to.\n\nBuy this game! Even if you have never played 4X games before. This is a good game for beginners too and at this price it is worth giving it a go. The support for the game is amazing, the forums are very helpful and best of all there is more content to come in the form of dlcs and expansions, which are likely to feature new playable races, new scenarios, and maybe new campaigns","April 24, 2014","true","245.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

It consists of two parts; strategic world map and turn-based battles. I'll briefly explain each one here. There's a campaign mode which is fun but my favourite part of the game is the random map which you can customize the hell out of. There's an incredible amount of options for you to customize your own skirmish game. You can have a very short one with a small map, with huge amounts of resources and starting with large armies, or you can have a large map with lots of civilizations, slow research times, few starting resources (and few resources on the map) and so forth. You can even customize the terrain if you want to take the time, so there are a lot of options to suit your fancy.\n\nYou'll choose a race (human, orc, goblin, elf, etc.) and a class (warlord, theocrat, dradnought, sorcerer, etc) for your civilization. Each race has specific strengths and weaknesses and each class is very very different. A warlord civilization for example are focused on strong conventional armies, a dreadnought civilizationis focused on industry and powerful siege engines, a sorcerer civilization is magic based and so on. Your starting hero (which is like a leader of your overall civ and can be used as a general in your armies) will determine the class of your civilization, so choosing a warlord hero will make your civilization a warlord civ, but you can recruit other heroes of other classes as the game progresses.\n\nWorld map - this part of the game is very much like Civilization V and is wonderfully simple and easy to learn. You'll begin with a settler (or a city depending on what options you chose to start with) and your settler will set up your first city, you can choose where. Cities produce gold, production and mana resources and you can build city upgrades and recruit units from them. There are resource structures on the map and if they are inside your city's borders then they give bonuses to gold, production, mana or research. Gold is used to build upgrades in your cities, recruit units and has some functions in diplomacy (yes there's diplomacy with independent cities and other civs), production is very simple - if your city is producing 20 production and a barracks takes 100 production to build, you'll build it in 5 turns. Mana is used to cast spells and knowledge works like production except it's used to research new spells/technologies. Your cities also produce population and grow from small villages to huge metropolises. There's happiness and allignment too - if a city is happy they will throw a party in honour of you which nets you some gold, and alignment is good and evil (and neutral) and is affected by things you do on the map, such as attacking independent cities or letting enemies run when they don't want to fight you. The strategic map is also quite beautiful. Think of it as Civilization V with a fantasy, Lord of the Rings-type feel to it.\n\nThe other part of the game is the battle map. You create your armies on the strategic map and when they meet enemies the game loads the battle map. The battle map is turn based and hex based with flanking penalties. You have a variety of units to command, each with very different skills (like necromancers that can raise the dead to fight for you and curse enemies) and your hero can cast spells that he/she has learned. It's all quite easy to learn but takes a bit of time to master.\n\nAs I said I think this game is underrated and it's definitely worth buying if you like 4X type games.","August 3, 2015","true","15.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","3"

It rarely gets boring since all minor conflicts can be solved through an auto-calculation so it never gets tedious.

It's a game about combat, and everything, from the UI, to the city building, to diplomacy itself is entirely in service to the engine of war that this game runs on. Cities are built to build and fund more soldiers. Spells and techs are researched to give an edge in battle or allow you to get more soldiers to bring into battle. Heroes are recruited and trained and killed in the name of war. And they will die, because death comes fast.\n\nThe game's selection of Races offer little more than stat changes for your units, granting passives and and a few advantages/disadvantages here and there. Elves have better archers, but are weak to poisons. Goblins have poorer stats, but massive innate poison resist. It's not too important, but definately does shift how you play. As elves, you'll snipe from max range often. As draconians, you won't care much about non-lethal incoming damage.\n\nClasses, namely leader class, determines far more, from your tech tree to your unique units, taking much of what is traditionally race based in other, less warmongering 4x games. Rogues get access to demons, stealth spells, and plenty of tricks to force enemy cities into open revolt. Theocrats tithe for gold like it's going out of style. Dreadnoughts cover massive areas in fiery death with warmachines that outright immune poison and holy damage, but lack counter-attack ability.\n\nCombat is suprisingly quick, due to units being able to destroy eachother in short order. Even levelled heroes are able to be struck down by a few first tier archers focusing fire. As such, mistakes get punished hard.\n\nThe game has great customization for the genre, letting you tailor your tech tree, your character and diplomacy screen appearance, hero growth, and make custom equipment to fit the situation.\n\nIn summary: I wholeheartedly suggest picking this game up if you're like me and your games of GalCiv2 or Civ V regularly decend into "If it moves, kill it.". Age of Wonders 3 simply does warmongering so much better, even if it comes at the cost of alternative victory conditions.","April 11, 2014","true","181.4"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

You cannot modify the environment around it, all what is left is to choose which building or unit will be next, and if you will use a special resource. It is really a sad point, because everything is ready in the game to do this, so it is obviously a game design choice. Amateurs of city builder will not find this enough.\n\nActually almost everything is focused around the combat. When enemy units meet, you can choose to resolve automatically or manually. If you choose manually, you then have a turn-based hexagon grid where you deploy your units, and where the deployment zones are functions of the relative locations o the units on the main map when the encounter started. This is not the big thing, but a nice idea. For the rest of the fight, it is dejà vu, so I will not go in details. But if you liked Heroes of Might & Magic, you get a lite version of the fighting encounter. In the long run it gets repetitive.\n\nYou've got a campaign, which without being a paragon of originality is not bad at all.\n\nThe graphics or the main map, are really nice, and the game runs without problems on Linux.\n\nIt is hard to either recommend or not this game.

There are also a few persistant bugs that still need to be fixed (some units on huge maps sometimes don't renew their movement points after turns are set, and a few other somewhat minor things).\n\nI've put in some 130+ hours or so on it already, and I see myself putting more into it. The campaign isn't really all that in my opinion, but I never played this series primarily for the campaign. If you can get 3 or more friends (and half a day) to play with you on a small-medium map, this game is great. If you can get them to play multiple sessions, going on a larger map is better.\n\nThat being said, I can't help but say that while it is only worth getting the game while it is on sale, it IS worth getting eventually. Especially if you can get friends in on it.","April 25","true","183.9"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","6","8","0","0"

Since then, Age of Wonders have been the one game I have played continuously throughout middle school, high school, and college. In my opinion, Age of Wonders III is the best of the franchise.\n\nOne of the greatest strength of Age of Wonders is its combat. In my opinion, Age of Wonders III is the best of the series in this regard. AowIII introduces new mechanics like flanking which make unit position incredibly important. A smaller army can quickly gain advantage of a stronger army just by utilizing flanking to their best ability.\nOne of strengths of Aow is the wide variety of units. AoWIII continues this trend. Abilities include dominate, seduce, faerie fire, hurl fire bomb, web, assassinate, hurl boulder, phase (teleport), and much more. These abilities make combat a very engaging and enjoyable.\n\nAoWIII introduces a new class system. These classes include the dreadnought, archdruid, rogue, sorcerer, theocrat, and warlord. Each class as their own set of combat spells, empire upgrades, and units, giving all classes a unique playstyle. As of this review, Triumph is working on a necromancer class. More information on the classes can be found on at http://ageofwonders.com/category/news/.\n\nLike previous games, AoWIII has a variety of races that the player can choose from. The original AowIII has elves, goblins, orcs, humans, dwarves, draconians. Halflings were added in the Golden Realms Expansion. Each race gets an irregular, an archer, an infantry, a cavalry, a pikeman, priest unit, and special final unit. Upon first glance, the races appear to be quite similar. However, there are subtle differences that can end up really impacting one strategy. As an example , consider the archer unit. Elf archers suffer no range penalty, allowing them to do full damage even at distance. Draconian archers laugh firebombs which damage all units in small area. Goblin archers shoot homing mosquitoes which can go through obstacle. Dwarf archers have crossbows which do better damage when they are at close range. Orcs have the worst archers with the worst range; however, they can cause units to bleed which does damage overtime. As one can see, there is a clear difference in the unit abilities.\n\nAlong with their class and race, players also choose specializations. These specializations revolve around elemental magic. Player can choose between air, fire, water, earth, creation, and destruction. Each specialization has global and combat spells as well as enchantment and summons. In the original game, there are two non-magic specializations-explorer and expander. These specializations add another level of strategy. When one considers all the race, class, and specializations, there is an astounding number of combinations and strategies to use to destroy one enemies.\n\nIn my opinion, AoWIII is the best in the series. It’s one of my favorite games. On a final note, the devs are really involved in the community. They really listen to players and incorporate suggestions in the gameplay. Triumph Studios is an amazing studio. They have put a lot of work into this game and continue to do so.\n","November 4, 2014","true","457.7"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","64","9","14","2","0"

All of these options affect how you will play the game. Will you become a Dwarf Arch Druid and heal the land around your empire to reap the awards of a bountiful Harvest? Or will you become a Dragonkin Mage and call down fire and plague and destroy your rival's lands? These spells and skills also affect the combat in the game. Your heroes will have one time spells to use to decimate a particulary powerful creature or even call up a large random creature, which turns out to be a poisonous death adder.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bearsmith/recommended/226840/","bearsmith","Frank The Dragoon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bearsmith/","241 products in account","A fun, somewhat, competent 4x game that puts a large focus on warfare, Age of Wonders 3 is a great game if you don't look too closely at the seams. In my time playing there are a few concerns that have grown over time and kept this game from being great.\n\nAmong these is the enormous focus on warfare. In short, if you are not building towards better units you are doing the wrong thing. Powerful units are paramount for combat of course, but on top of that, there really isn't any other option. Religion? Non-existent. Economy? There are two or three buildings, tops, that will generate any sort of capital. In fact, this makes city placement one of the most important parts of the game; as they dictate what materials you can get at the city.\n\nThis brings me nicely to the second problem with the game; enemy AI. The AI in this game is hilarious. They will jump eagerly off their walls during sieges. They will run tword your town only to see that it is a bit large and then do circuits, a bit confused at what they are to do. You will repeatedly see your teammate lose battles because, for some reason, they decided to send a single hero into a group of tier three monsters. Finally, they will neglect to clear monsters from the resource nodes around their cities for literally dozens of turns thereby starving themselves of resources.\n\nAnd that is what really kills the game for me. I build up a great army (because I have too) to fight opponents too stupid to even keep their resources clear to fund an army that will literally jump from their own battlements.\n\nAll of that said, this isn't a terrible game. There is a good sense of involvement in combat, and a great deal of strategy especially due to the flanking system that is missing from other games such as FELH. Those who are expecting a full fledged 4x experience would probably be served better elsewhere, but if you are a fan of tabletop battle games then Age of Wonders Three is a very fun combat simulator for a fraction of the cost. Hopefully the upcoming patch fixes a lot of the issues so that I can change the more negative aspects of this review, but as the game stands it is a 7/10 for me. Buy it only if you are not expecting a "pure" 4x experience.\n\nEDIT UPDATE 1.09:\n\nUpdate 1.09 has hit and there have been a lot of quality of life enhancements. Enemy AI has improved dramatically in regards to walls, and sieges in general, and I have noticed my allies actively clearing nodes beyond just the first time they settle an area. It still doesn't happen as frequently as I feel it should, but that may be because I am playing on "Lord" difficulty (sort of mid tier) for the random matches.\n\nI have, however, noticed more problems that escaped me on the outset, especially in regards to diplomacy and how NPCs decide how much they like you. One of my biggest gripes at this point is that if an enemy dislikes you it is nearly impossible to have them change their opinion. This is agravated by the fact that declaring war on anything, including independent units, is looked upon very poorly by the AI. For example, I gifted an NPC money every turn for nearly twenty turns and they still were "distrustful" of me since I claimed an independent city. Furthermore, NPCs that like you think you are a god beyond reproach. I purchased half of my allies cities for a pittance (literally not even a turns worth of mana) and there wasn't even a change to his diplomatic value. Another thing to note is if you are allies and at peace with an NPC if you wish to attack them you will have to wait two full turns before being able to actually attack. This makes it so that alliances are very difficult to break, and prevents any sort of subterfuge which I find disappointing. That is definitely more of a personal issue, but it feels a bit out of place in such a war based game and prevents surprise invasions. I wouldn't be surprised if this is a carry over from the multiplayer.\n\nAnother issue I have is that certain classes and races seem to have serious advantages; specifically the druids and elves. The druid tier 4 summon has an ability called thunderstrike that can be used across the field, has a chance to stun, is an AoE, and is on a three turn cooldown. Combine this with the elf passive of not suffering the ranged damage penalty and you have a very dominate long range army even when made of low tier units. In comparison, the theocrat class seems to be very underpowered; mostly due to a more melee and passive overworld bonus focus. It just seems like a poor fit since the overworld is so disappointing overall and the siege focus late game. I would expect major changes in DLC for how this class functions.\n\nMy previous positive statements about this game still stand though and due to the better siege mechanics I will now give the game an 8/10. Sieges are now very engaging, and stressful, affairs where you will have to carefully time when and where you are going to hit the enemies defenses rather than taking pot-shots at suicidal archers. Again, this is not a game to purchase if you want to have a good overworld experience; it simply cant deliver that at this point in its life.","April 9, 2014","true","41.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The series has been my favorite when it comes to strategy games. I was extremely excited when Triumph Studios announced the third installment of the series. I have watched the status of AOW III develop from the initial announcement up until release.\n\nSo, here is my review based on 10 ours of in-game experience. I am extremely impressed with the AI. It is a much greater improvement over the original games. The AI is really taking me for run! I never had much challenge with the AI in the previous games. I like the detailed terrain and atmosphere of the maps/world. The tactical combats are sweet and prettier than the previous games. Also, the tactical AI is much smarter as well. In AOW II SM, I would lure enemies out of the gate in a siege and slaughter them... it doesn't work like that anymore. :D The AI is tough and smarter. The soundtrack is AWESOME! I wish I would have got the deluxe edition just for the soundtrack. I'll have to wait until they release it as DLC. I love how the knights look in AOW III. Their armor shines as they sit on their steeds with their lances; it brings a nice heroic personality. During the 10 hours of in-game experiences I have really enjoyed game. It is fun, exciting, and challenging. I rate it a 9/10 in my opinion.\n\nHere are some of the things I would suggest to improve AOW III. Angels... I really miss the angels from AOW II. Beautiful females, powerful, and celestial beings. They were my favorite unit, and I love how they could only be summoned. AOW III has angelic-like beings called the exalted. However, they just don't fit in the game as the female angels would. Another thing reflecting back upon the angels is that you can also get goblin angels, human angels, dwarf angels, etc... This is due to the new class system in AOW III. Angels, succubus, etc need to be unique, and preferably summoned instead of being standard recruitable creatures. I am hoping Triumph will bring back the angels from AOW II as summons. :) Another thing I would suggest is to bring back the old method of handling flying creatures. In AOW II you needed magic, another flying unit, ranged units, or for the flying unit to attack you in order to deal damage to a flying unit. Based on what I have seen all creatures whether flying or not can hit a flying unit. Lastly, I do prefer the 2d art for heroes and leaders as compared to the 3d stuff (lowest priority).\n\nIn conclusion, Age of Wonders III is a solid game that will bring an exciting and challenging experience. I am very happy with my purchase and will continue to support Triumph Studio on further development of Age of Wonders III! 9/10!","April 4, 2014","true","36.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The series has been my favorite when it comes to strategy games. I was extremely excited when Triumph Studios announced the third installment of the series. I have watched the status of AOW III develop from the initial announcement up until release.\n\nSo, here is my review based on 10 ours of in-game experience. I am extremely impressed with the AI. It is a much greater improvement over the original games. The AI is really taking me for run! I never had much challenge with the AI in the previous games. I like the detailed terrain and atmosphere of the maps/world. The tactical combats are sweet and prettier than the previous games. Also, the tactical AI is much smarter as well. In AOW II SM, I would lure enemies out of the gate in a siege and slaughter them... it doesn't work like that anymore. :D The AI is tough and smarter. The soundtrack is AWESOME! I wish I would have got the deluxe edition just for the soundtrack. I'll have to wait until they release it as DLC. I love how the knights look in AOW III. Their armor shines as they sit on their steeds with their lances; it brings a nice heroic personality. During the 10 hours of in-game experiences I have really enjoyed game. It is fun, exciting, and challenging. I rate it a 9/10 in my opinion.\n\nHere are some of the things I would suggest to improve AOW III. Angels... I really miss the angels from AOW II. Beautiful females, powerful, and celestial beings. They were my favorite unit, and I love how they could only be summoned. AOW III has angelic-like beings called the exalted. However, they just don't fit in the game as the female angels would. Another thing reflecting back upon the angels is that you can also get goblin angels, human angels, dwarf angels, etc... This is due to the new class system in AOW III. Angels, succubus, etc need to be unique, and preferably summoned instead of being standard recruitable creatures. I am hoping Triumph will bring back the angels from AOW II as summons. :) Another thing I would suggest is to bring back the old method of handling flying creatures. In AOW II you needed magic, another flying unit, ranged units, or for the flying unit to attack you in order to deal damage to a flying unit. Based on what I have seen all creatures whether flying or not can hit a flying unit. Lastly, I do prefer the 2d art for heroes and leaders as compared to the 3d stuff (lowest priority).\n\nIn conclusion, Age of Wonders III is a solid game that will bring an exciting and challenging experience. I am very happy with my purchase and will continue to support Triumph Studio on further development of Age of Wonders III! 9/10!","April 4, 2014","true","36.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

That's where its core is!\nEvery class and race play differently with their pros and cons so gameplay and replayability are kept alive and fresh by the "let me try this now!" factor.\nCity management is secondary, but not irrilevant: you'll find yourself specializing cities and terraforming here and there to suit them to your strategy and playstyle.\nIt'll completely suck you in and if you've a friend to play with it's even better!\nMP goes on at a VERY slow pace, especially when it's more than 3 Leaders involved, but the pause between turns gives you time to do other things like reading a book, watching a video or a movie, checking the Tome of Wonders, planning next moves and so forth... so its apparently weak spot is instead another of its great points.\nAI is a bit weird at times but it reacts and listens to your request and proposals pretty well.\nSo forge alliances, betray, bribe other factions and set them at war against your opponents. Level up your Heroes, send them afar to expand your domains and rule the land with the iron grip and brute force of the Orcs! Or dwell in the underground and patiently multiply your Goblins waiting to erupt to the surface and destroy the land of men!\nCleanse the earth and bring peace in all the Empire as the Leader of High Elves or forge incredible machines that will shake the ground beneath their wheels and crush your enemies as a Dwarven Dreadnought!\nSeriously... never had had this fun in a long time!!\nHighly recommended!","November 9, 2015","true","212.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

You can customize your own avatar and the choice of talents, class and race have significant impact to how your game will play out, allowing to pick a combination most suited to your playstyle. Or just experiment if that's your thing.\n\nAs mentioned, the empire management aspects are lacking compared to the competition. Tech tree gets exhausted pretty quickly and it's pretty easy to win by overpowering the AI in early game. On the other hand this kind of setup allows for faster and more 'action' oriented multiplayer matches. However the AI is notoriously bad in terms of diplomacy and still has some bugs that make it easy to beat even on higher difficulties. Add to that an incomplete diplomatic system and the only real option to win the game outside of scripted scenarios is full on military conquest.\n\nThe best part however is the combat system. Units are carefully balanced and the combat system allows to win through superior tactics against much more powerful armies... if you know what you're doing. Finding out the various tactics to take down particularly tough units is half the fun. Defending a city surrounded assaulted by a superior foe is suitably satisfying, as is taking out defenders through tactical use of the right units.\n\nOveral: Age of Wonders 3 is a Heroes of Might and Magic meets Civilization in a Tolkien-ish inspired setting. Don't get it for the empire management or you'll be disappointed. Get it for the combat and magic system and it's loads of fun.","June 16, 2014","true","292.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

That's where its core is!\nEvery class and race play differently with their pros and cons so gameplay and replayability are kept alive and fresh by the "let me try this now!" factor.\nCity management is secondary, but not irrilevant: you'll find yourself specializing cities and terraforming here and there to suit them to your strategy and playstyle.\nIt'll completely suck you in and if you've a friend to play with it's even better!\nMP goes on at a VERY slow pace, especially when it's more than 3 Leaders involved, but the pause between turns gives you time to do other things like reading a book, watching a video or a movie, checking the Tome of Wonders, planning next moves and so forth... so its apparently weak spot is instead another of its great points.\nAI is a bit weird at times but it reacts and listens to your request and proposals pretty well.\nSo forge alliances, betray, bribe other factions and set them at war against your opponents. Level up your Heroes, send them afar to expand your domains and rule the land with the iron grip and brute force of the Orcs! Or dwell in the underground and patiently multiply your Goblins waiting to erupt to the surface and destroy the land of men!\nCleanse the earth and bring peace in all the Empire as the Leader of High Elves or forge incredible machines that will shake the ground beneath their wheels and crush your enemies as a Dwarven Dreadnought!\nSeriously... never had had this fun in a long time!!\nHighly recommended!","November 9, 2015","true","212.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

The clean visual look and easy to follow unit art combines well with a deeply layered strategy game that has an amazing depth of content, particularly with both DLC packages included.\n\nThe top layer of the game is all about strategy - building up your empire, expanding your cities reach, marshalling a vast army of armored elves, lucky halflings, or agile tigrans and assaulting dungeons and tombs for ancient treasure while balancing your diplomacy and maintaining an alignment that may influence your neighbors opinion of you (if you even care what they think - especially if your goal is to crush them like a bug).\n\nWhen you get into battle with an opposing force, the game really shines again with a powerful tactical layer - positioning your units to defend their flanks and take advantage of your enemies over-reaching become as important as fielding the proper units.  Pikes deployed against mounted cavalry works brilliantly, especially if you can get behind a spent and exhaused human Knight!  Then again, a well placed fireball can work wonders, as well.\n\nThe races and classes are many and varied, and with one amazing spell or ability to research after another regardless of the combination you select at map setup you'll play for hundreds of hours before you start to see all the combinations.  From Warlords and their incredibly potent troops to Necromancers and Sorcerers with their poweful magic and mighty summons, including Dread Reapers and Eldrich Horrors, there is something here for all types of strategy gamers.\n\nThe multi-player in simultaneous mode works wonders - especially if you are playing with friends on teams, it takes a long time to complete a game but it's just an amazing half a dozen hours to spend.\n\nIn the end, I've probably spent as much time watching videos as I have playing it, and I am looking forward to many more years of both - there is a lot to learn, and a lot to dig into, but the basics are simple and elegant and the longeveity of the game is definitely something worth considering.

Whether youre a fan of the old series, as i am, or a newcomer who enjoys 4X games, Age of Wonders III will keep you persistently hungry for "one more turn". I have not played the campaign much (i never do in these games) but the skirmish/random map mode is exactly what i want out of games like this.\n\nExploration is very rewarding in AOW3, as each randomly generated world feels rich and large. Whatever method, pattern, or logic it is that the world generator uses, it does its job; mountains, forests, and rivers all fit very naturally together, have plenty of variety with sensibly placed climates/regions, and just look wonderful. The resources are spaced and balanced really well, and there are tons of dungeons and rare encounters to discover and conquer. I always get absorbed in roaming the world, every time.\n\nHero creation is fun. The classes are mostly what you are used to (warriors, wizards, priests, etc), but there are many combinations of race/class/specializations available whos impacts on the game are felt gradually over the course of your campaign, and every change can have a major impact on how you play, so it is easy to get excited about trying out each one. Personally, i spend almost as much time creating heroes and imagining up personalities for them as i do actually playing the game (LOL), and the fact that i can make them, not only for myself, but for the NPCs as well really gets me into the game alot more than i would be otherwise.\n\nThere are plenty of spells, including hidden ones, plenty of items and equipment, including some you make yourself, and plenty of monsters, most of which you can learn to either capture or acquire for your own armies. Some units have unique abilities when certain classes and races combine to produce them, and each hero can be customized with RPG-style level-upgrades and equipment. There are also rare units which can only be discovered through exploration, or by conquering/befreinding key locations, so even play throughs with the same customized faction will vary and feel different.\n\nThe tactical combat is better than i have seen in a 4X game in a long time. Many different unit roles exist, with a variety of strengths and positions which counter them, and each has advantages at different times. Combined with heroes and spells, there are many things to think about in battle, and many strategies to win with. The sheer number of unit abilities in this game is impressive in its own right, but once you begin to realize that every single one of them counters, and is countered by, something else, things move to a whole new level. The action-point and flanking systems ensure that you cannot simply hire a few beefy units and chop your way through hordes of enemies... there is a limit to how much one badass can do in a turn, and you WILL be outmaneuvered and killed by cheap little weaklings if you do not position your units correctly.\n\nIf i had to complain about something in this game, i could only think of two things to mention. Firstly, the diplomacy mechanics are ♥♥♥♥. To be fair, they usually are in 4X games; diplomacy rarely ever gets implimented well into games which are mostly designed around combat but, in this case, it feels especially worthless. Most NPCs will decide whether or not they are at war with you before you even open the diplomacy screen, and once it has been decided there is really nothing you can do to change things. There isnt much you can trade, and NPCs will typically never accept a trade anyway, so this much of the game may as well be removed.\n\nAnd Secondly, the difficulty of the game is spasmatic at best. One game, you may walk over everyone else as though they werent even there, and the next you may be clinging to life every turn; there seems to be no consistency even within the same difficulty levels of this game. I have had several matches where i have spent hours exploring the world only to find one of the enemy factions tucked away in a corner of the map repeatedly failing to extablish a second city for some reason or another, and i have also had matches where all of my cities were under constant siege by max level units before i had even located an enemy. It is wildly inconsistent and, if you do not limit the number of heroes a faction may have, AI factions will hire as many as they can afford to the exclusion of everything else.\n\nBut, the game is amazing and has only been getting better with each patch. As far as i am concerned, there is no better 4X available right now, and it is worth the full price of 40 dollars. If you catch this thing on sale, you would be a fool to pass it up.","May 28, 2014","true","095.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","1"

The strategic and tactical parts of the game complement each other greatly.\n\nThis game is focused on strategy and combat. Everything relates to that, from empire building to leveling your heroes. But don't be afraid, it may be a lot of combat all the time, but the combat is deep enough to be different every time. The game's classes offer you many distinct flavours on how you run your empire, on what kind of army you build, on how your strategies play out. Some classes are more mobile, some classes are better at annoying others, some classes are better at simply building up. The difference does not lie in whether they have units to wage war with, the difference lies in how strong those units are, how they reinforce your armies, how your spells reinforce your armies and wether the class is better at direct battles or sneaking past the front lines.\n\nA bit about empire building: this game is not civilization. The way you develop your cities is not based on what research you unlock and there are NOT a hundred different buildings to choose from. Instead, your building decisions are based on what units you want to unlock, what resources you need more of and how many units you need right NOW. At first, empire building will seem simple compared to other 4x games, but it ties in very well with the other parts of the game.\n\nDislaimer: I am a total fanboy. I've been part of closed beta testing and met the developers.\nWarning: This game has ruined tactical role playing games for me. It has ruined other strategy game tactical combat for me.

Much of the game is great - the grpahics, interface, music and basic gameplay elements. You certainly won't lack for gameplay, the two campaigns took me well over 100 hours to finish, although I never use auto combat so battles made up most of that time.\n\nThe hate part comes from the lack of documenation and a few really terrible scenarios in the campaigns. All games should have a manual, especially games this complex, but there is no manual.\n\nThree of twelve scenarios in the campaigns are awful, some of the worst scenario designs I have encountered in decades of playing strategy games, the rest of the scenarios are lots of fun. One is horrible because it has a hidden timer. The other two, the last scenarios in each campaign are horrible because they are mind numbingly frustrating. You have far too many enemies to fight, your basic task is to fight two leaders and attack them with a particular hero. Finding the two leaders is a slow, boring process. It's an idiotic idea which pretty much ruined both campaigns for me. If you are lucky you won't have to play these scenarios, it depends on choices you make earlier in the campaigns.\n\nI do recommend this game if you are willing to put up with some frustration.","April 13, 2015","true","261.1"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CRIXTREME/recommended/226840/","CRIXTREME","С Г エ χ","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CRIXTREME/","320 products in account","I'm going to start off this review with a couple of things:\n\nI've never played AoW 1 or 2\nAnd I'm going to compare it to HoMM3\n\n\n\nAoWIII is sorta a fantasy 4X game with very similiar gameplay to the heroes of might and magic series. You have a hero, town(s), and go around raising troops, casting spells, leveling up, exploring the map, and eventually conquering your enemy.\n\n\nThe graphics are pretty nice, it's easy to tell what sort of terrain is what, units are stylistic, and overall the graphics suit the game well.  The music got boring real quick, normally with this kind of game you eventually turn off the music, but I had it off within a few days.\n\nA couple of big differences between this and HoMM are how units are handled. Gone are stacks of 5500 power liches, instead each 'stack' of units on the map can go up to 6 SEPERATE units. This means that a squad of swordsmen is treated as a single unit, and functions the same at 1 HP as it would full. I'm not sure if this good or bad, but that's just how it is.  While you might say battles would be smaller, they can actually be significantly bigger than HoMM, as you can have adjcent stacks on the map help you attack an enemy stack(s).\n\nBattles are also very different (yet) similiar compared to HoMM.  Like HoMM you can cast a spell a turn by your main hero, all your units move in a hex and have different ways to attack and special effects. However, in AoW it's more more tactical, there are flanking attacks that can potentially deny counter attacks and attacks of opportunity against the enemy if they try moving through an enemies' zone of control.\n\nAnother big difference between HoMM and AoW is towns. In HoMM towns are usually rare and extremely important objectives for either side, in AoW, you pretty much are able to build towns almost anywhere.  This is an interesting mechanic, but ultimately I found it very boring.  It isn't very difficult to  figure out where to place towns, and as the game goes on I felt I was wasting a lot of time picking what buildings to build in each of my cities, it isn't like civilization either where picking what to build can be a very strategic thing with upsides and downsides (upkeep).\n\nCompared to HoMM, the different races feel overall are way too similiar. Aside from minor stat differences and sometimes damage type differences each race will only have a couple of units that actually stand out from others.\n\nThe point fo the above is to try and place an emphasis on hero types. At the start of the map you will select/customize a hero.  You'll choice from a choice of 6 different jobs and select 3 extra magic types.  The job has the biggest effect on how you will play the game. Each one gives you access to the majority of the spells/special units that you will recruit.  This is a very interesting mechanic, however I found it to be somewhat boring in practice.\n\nFor example, playing as an archdruid will give you access to Hunters, they're basically bowmen that can charm animals, are better at crossing difficult terrain, and they wear very decorative large masks adorned with feathers.\n\nWhile playing as a draconian, they fit in perfectly with the rest of the army. However, this is how they look for ALL the races.\nNot only that but, they're almost identical no matter what race you have. Why can't goblin hunters focus on traps? Human hunters can be mounted or have tracking dogs with them?  It's even worse when you select a warlord, as two of their special units are bersekers and warkin (basically ogryn from 40k). All bersekers are bald. Even high elves. And they look absolutely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.\n\nIf they couldn't differentiate the units in abilities due to balancing issues, at least they could make the units thematically look like they belong to the faction, something HoMM did very well.\n\nAnother minor problem I have with the game is there isn't a quick access for your different heroes you might have hired, you have to bring up the overview panel then switch to your armies. This wouldn't be a problem, except for that you can't have the overview panel up at the same time as your city build orders, which is a problem, because over the course of the game you'll have both a large amount of cities and units.\n\nAdditionally, the neutral units available for fighting and recruiting/prizes feel very small, it might just be because I played HoMMIII with WoG and that offered quite a good selection. Another thing HoMM had that AoW lacks are interesting items to loot for your hero or neutral unit hexes that let you hire them. While there are a couple of special town types like dragon they function a little differently\n\n\n\nI really want to like this game. Its combat is fun, and has some really great mechanics dragged down by citiy micomanagement, race diversity, and some lazy copy\pasting unit designs\n\nEdit:\n\nSince there's been two expansions for this game, they've been absolutely great. They did a pretty good job at giving each race more unique abilities, and added more neutral units and items. I don't like necromancers though, the mechanics they have seem so gamechanging compared to the other hero classes.","June 19, 2014","true","227.0"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","4"

But truth be told, the actuall combat mechanics and AI leaves much to be desired. The different races all play the same, with mostly the same units to choose from, and it doesnt help that you can absorb any race into your empire and as such actaully play all races in one single game.\n\nThe different classes have some different spells and units to choose from, but spells in general are a bit of a letdown. You generally use the same two spells over and over again since there is no point in using anything else. Same with units, some units are way OP and when the enemy only build these units there is no point in creating diverse armies for the fun of it. Units dont have many special abilities, and the lower tiers become obsolete quickly.\n\nOne cool thing is that you can absorb the "special" NPC races such as dragons, giants and undead into your empire if you take one of their towns.\n\nOn a strategic note, you need to learn how to use your units to their full extent, and pay atention to flanking since this plays a major role in combat. Unfortenetly units with lots of HP generally have high dmg aswell, so using week dps units are just not an option in the long run, bigger is always better in this game.\n\nVerdict: Has some good ideas, and the game looks good. But after playing one custom map against the computer, you have basiclly experienced all there is to it. So good fun for 3-5 hours, then you forget about it.","May 11, 2014","false","45.1"," 28 of 52 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","28","52","0","0"

I'm going to hit on the negatives first so that at least I can end on a positive note.\n\nNegatives:\n\nThere is basically no strategic depth. There is absolutely no reason not to use the highest tier units as soon as possible, none of the units really fill a unique role, and in the end there's really just no point in building lower-tier units if higher tiers are available. The strategy boils down to "who can get high-tier units produced the fastest". The Total War series is an example where this was usually done fairly well, though admittedly not anywhere near perfect.\n\nThe classes aren't very well balanced: Sorcerers are incredibly powerful, since they can summon tier 4 units wherever they are and it costs no gold to do so. It allows them to effectively push forward and defend anywhere at any time. On the opposite end of the spectrum are Theocrats, who have basically nothing worth using in their own trees and must rely entirely on specializations.\n\nThe specializations aren't very diverse: The elemental ones are all almost exactly parallel with each other (not in relative power, but in the fact that the powers are all the same with reskins and a number or two tweaked), the destruction and creation specializations don't do anything meaningful, and the explorer specialization is entirely useless. Honestly I think I'd've scrapped this entirely. It feels bolted-on. You can completely ignore your specialization and it'll have no effect on your gameplay most of the time.\n\nThe races all feel exactly the same. I don't know if there are differences outside small hit point variances in the units or not, but if there are any they're very minor. For an example of this done better, see Heroes of Might & Magic (2, 3, or 5, if you want a specific one, basically any but 6 because that game is sadness in game form.)\n\nThe research tree is an absolute mess: it requires rote memorization to figure out what research leads where. In some cases it's fairly obvious, in others it seems random if you haven't sunk a significant amount of time into the game. This is a really common problem in strategy and tactical games. Sins of a Solar Empire had this done fairly well, as did XCOM's newest incarnations (in different ways, obviously).\n\nTactically there are a few options, but the tactical combat is incredibly and painfully repetitive. The A.I. has been improved some, but still isn't especially good. In truth I don't have a great answer for a game where this was done exceptionally well. In RTS games it usually isn't a problem, since the computer is just made more aggressive with more resources. Turn based games are a tougher nut to crack, though. Shogun 2 was one with a reasonably good A.I., but certainly not an excellent one.\n\nMultiplayer games with simultaneous turns are abysmally un-fun. Simultaneous turns in general don't work, with some units freezing in place when attacked by an enemy (when you would normally move away before the enemy could get in close), and generally team-turns would work much better than the way simultaneous turns work now.\n\nNow for the good stuff:\n\nEach of the classes does play in a unique way. The specializations may not make much difference, but the classes are incredibly varied and have a good blend of niche and flexible abilities.\n\nThe game looks remarkably good for the most part. It's not graphically brilliant, but the art design was well put together, you have a lot of options for how your main hero will look and nothing looks cheap.\n\nWhile it's a bit of a mixed bag, the spellcasting/ability use in general is generally entertaining and can have a fairly significant effect on the tides of battle.\n\nThe UI is mostly intuitive, though it too has a few areas that would benefit from clearer labelling.\n\nThat's what I've got. Hope it helps!","September 20, 2014","false","58.5"," 16 of 29 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","16","29","0","0"

On paper, it sounds great; but in reality it isnt massively interesting.  The variety in gameplay comes through the tech trees in both what your cities are producing and on the special abilities that you can impose on your empire. But both trees are relatively short and you can reach the end of both a long way before you end a game. Like a lot of empire building games, the more cities you build, the more tedious it becomes. Sadly, the combat is also repetitive - the same maps with the same enemies in the same positions. It takes a short while to get used to, but once you do, you will be applying the same tactics over and over again.\n\nIn short, there isnt much to recommend the game. Its not terribly programmed, but there just isnt enough depth to keep you interested.","January 6, 2015","false","152.4"," 21 of 39 people (54%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","54","21","39","4","0"

However, if you are new to the gendre I would rather wait till discount or buy some other strategy game first. It should be noted though that I've only played multiplayer so my recommendation is solely based on that.\nIf roughly compared to other 4x strategy games I've played I would say it's better than Endless Legend but worse than Civilization V, and quite par on par with Endless Space. This is of course my personal opinion, and coming from someone who rarely touches single player aspect of strategy games and plays almost solely against friends in multiplayer.\nThe little experience I've had with AI is that it's somewhat repeative, stupid and predictable. For example if AI is defending a city it tends to charge trough the gates giving attacking player easy win. But this is very common for games (that's why I play almost solely against human opponents) and Age of Wonders still does better job with AI than for example Civilization V.","January 12","true","56.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Got it on sale in my country and soon bought the expansions on steam for normal price and found they are very much worth it.\nIf you like what you see on their promo videos, you will propably like it or love it ;).\n\nGame has many so many different  ways to play either solo or with friends:\nMany different difficulty and size ready campaings with a plot and ready made leaders (though those are not not my cup of thea rlly), many ready made scenarios with a set map or the very highly customizable and to me the oh so addicting random maps with expansion added customizable win conditions, not just rush and crush yer enemy, but call for diplomacy and patience too.\n\nOn scenario or random maps you can customize your leader from the start, and not just skills, make them look fabulous (or wicked fabulous) too, wich I love, makes me very attached to them  :D!\nAnd you can save the looks and start skills of your new leaders to a custom char "base", to choose them later as your chars or enemies again in another game.\nChar/Class skill developement way feels very exiting to me cause there is an element of chance to what new skills you get to research with time or what you and your heroes get each lvl .\nWith 166 hours played and diff chars I still feel happy to see new skills for main char or heroes, or eagerly await for something to pop up I`d rly like.\nClass and race options feel like making a big difference in gameplay and make me want to try out more combinations.\n\nAnd fun: you can even play with or against your self= set all or some players to "human" at  random map options and you can take turns with multiple self created chars, of course with ai enemy added if you  so choose.\nEven wage war on yourself, and use "autocombat" in battle if you want the ai to take over one char to prevent you from cheating any ;)\nAnd, if like me you like to take your time  and make a solo all human game to  exlore the random  world "for ages "in one game, choose an extra large map with win conditons either  Unify or Seals , make your all human crazy group to switch turns and either work together or try to snuff each other.\nEither way, if you left the roaming independents on in your setting, you should  still scout the lands for threats early ( dangerous spawn points that get harder with lvl ) before a herd of bonedragons comes knocking just when you thought your  halfling Metropolis of "Happytown" is doing so good in a happy solo game ... Happened to me ;)\nCheers, my two cents!=A Highly recommended game! Feels like it was very lovingly made by the devs :D\n\nPS. and modding. So nice to have modding.

Not this one. AoW3 delivers a deep experience that you can approach from a number of different ways: there's campaigns, scenarios, multiplayer--and random map, which is by far the best feature.\n\nFor The Elder Scrolls II: Daggerfall, Bethesda randomly generated a world the size of Great Britain. Once. AoW3 does that every time you start a new random map. Yeah, they're not really comparable, but the point is made. No two random maps are the same. A single, 8-player, extra large random map will get you your money's worth out of AoW3, then you'll start a new one as a different race, different class, different school of magic, and you'll do it again and it'll be all-new.

But seriously a good solid game. If you want a Civ type game is a fantasy setting this is one of the best ones out there. Lots of customization and depth. Very detailed character creation and great mechanics for customizing the play to your own style. Want to sneak up on your enemies? Smite them from afar? Smash them with giant machines? Blast them with terrible magics? Negotiate with them (coward... jk)?  you can do it here.\n\nFirst the basics-\n\nGraphics- immersive and well executed, solid if not flashy. 8/10\n\nGameplay- Easy to play and learn. It has good depth when you want to dive down into the mechanics. 9/10\n\nMusic/SF- Nothing jarring or off putting, but nothing epic either. Always switched to my own tunes fairly quickly. 5/10\n\nContent- Lots of good stuff on the map, fun to explore. Plenty of scenarios and several main campaigns, but no really engaging stories, I find I go to randoms maps as I come back to the game. as a RPG 4/10, as a 4X 9/10.\n\nOk so now lets look at this as a 4x-\n\neXplore- This is probably my favorite part of the game. Many and various encounters on the map lead to a lot of variety in gameplay. This has a feel like Heros of M&M 3, with maps full of goodies.\n\neXpand- Not really part of the game. Oh sure you grow your city and maybe build a couple more, but there is no real benefit or mechanic for the massive empire in this game.\n\neXploit- Magic always makes this fun. I really enjoy the way it lets you manipulate the environment of the game. Lots of ways to customize your character to fit your style.\n\neXterminate- This is were this game shines. It has good combat mechanics that make each battle different, but also allows you to turn things over to the AI when you get too bogged down late game. Every race and every class bring their own unit types and style to combat, making it extremely variable and challenging.\n\nIn the end I recommend this game. If you saw RPG and came for that turn around now, but otherwise a good game and worth the price.","December 25, 2015","true","62.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

However, in the defense of that mechanic there are options of using Summoned units, Inns, and rewards gained from battle or clearing quests to earn an army. Some of those features are clearly not in Civilization V.\n\nFor me the better game series to compare to comes from the Real Time Strategy games known as Warcraft (Age of Wonders III) and Starcraft (as opposed to Civ V). If you ever played Warcraft III you might remember the times of having a Hero unit that could (and often did) become more powerful than most other units of your army, sometimes more powerful than a small handful of units on their own.\n\nAge of Wonders III uses a Hero system in a similar concept as Turn Based Strategy game. Your heroes level up, earn abilities. You can quest, battle, or even forge your own gear (non-campaign on the forging bits) for your heroes to use in combat. Heroes can die, and when they die they drop all the items they had on them. But you do not have to say goodbye to them forever because there are ways in game to revive them, powerful revival magic (instead of hero shrines from Warcraft 3).\n\nTLDR: Ultimately, if you play the game for a single player experience you will find enjoyment in the campaigns, and for a time in the solo scenarios, random maps, and various play styles. However, combat will quickly become tedious and repetative. Against the A.I. I recommend using Auto-Battle most the time, but the true glory of the Manual Battles is when you can fight against a Human Opponent using either Online, LAN, or Hotseat as a multi-player turn based game.\n\nQuick Notes:\n\n- I recommend Turn Based with a 3 minute turn timer for small groups.\n(turn timer incase people forget to hit end turn)\n\n- There is the option to use Simultaneous turns\n(but it can feel choppy, and it can lead to logisitic problems for battle prep on the strategic map)","January 6","true","109.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

For example You have spell that are individual cast on tiles to convert to forest, etc.... yet there is one spell just as in previous versions of the game that you cast and tiles will automatically expand from your domain to this unnamed type of tile.

However, in the defense of that mechanic there are options of using Summoned units, Inns, and rewards gained from battle or clearing quests to earn an army. Some of those features are clearly not in Civilization V.\n\nFor me the better game series to compare to comes from the Real Time Strategy games known as Warcraft (Age of Wonders III) and Starcraft (as opposed to Civ V). If you ever played Warcraft III you might remember the times of having a Hero unit that could (and often did) become more powerful than most other units of your army, sometimes more powerful than a small handful of units on their own.\n\nAge of Wonders III uses a Hero system in a similar concept as Turn Based Strategy game. Your heroes level up, earn abilities. You can quest, battle, or even forge your own gear (non-campaign on the forging bits) for your heroes to use in combat. Heroes can die, and when they die they drop all the items they had on them. But you do not have to say goodbye to them forever because there are ways in game to revive them, powerful revival magic (instead of hero shrines from Warcraft 3).\n\nTLDR: Ultimately, if you play the game for a single player experience you will find enjoyment in the campaigns, and for a time in the solo scenarios, random maps, and various play styles. However, combat will quickly become tedious and repetative. Against the A.I. I recommend using Auto-Battle most the time, but the true glory of the Manual Battles is when you can fight against a Human Opponent using either Online, LAN, or Hotseat as a multi-player turn based game.\n\nQuick Notes:\n\n- I recommend Turn Based with a 3 minute turn timer for small groups.\n(turn timer incase people forget to hit end turn)\n\n- There is the option to use Simultaneous turns\n(but it can feel choppy, and it can lead to logisitic problems for battle prep on the strategic map)","January 6","true","109.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I was looking for a game to scratch my "Disciples: Sacred Lands" itch and found a game that played like a hybrid of the aforementioned itch and the later games of the "Civilization" franchise. Gameplay is enjoyable and well developed, but not so complicated that it detracts from the over-all experience. Animations such as the number of soldiers in a unit being a visible "health bar" for the overall unit is a nice touch, as are the animations in general. I have had much enjoyment watching my Dwarven Musketeers open fire against the flank of an Orc Spearmen unit. Or my Elven Longbowmen fire wave after wave of arrows into their foes.\n\nThe lore is well done, and not too heavy or crying out for your undivided attention, but there is enough there to get you into the game's mechanics, whilst leaving room for DLC and add on campaigns and scenarios which will help this already interesting game stay fresh. A good soundtrack with a variety of fantasy inspired tracks doesn't hurt either, I have found myself humming along to the soundtrack on more than one occasion. A privilege in strategy games previously only enjoyed by Paradox.\n\nMultiplayer is remincent of other games in the genre. I would recommend playing it with close friends, or people in the same room as big maps with strangers would be a bold, and overly optimistic state of affairs.\n\nAll in all a good experience fully worth the money advertised. I fully expect many hours to be lost to this little gem and would not lament that fact.","July 9, 2014","true","61.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I held no real expectations, as most modern reboots of older franchises subscribe to conformed design and retain less than a desireable amount of their core originality. Oftentimes it actually alienates the core of the original fangroups. Angering at minimum a considerable amount of fans. Now... I could go on a long and verbose tangent comparing this to its predecessors, but I figure creating a category for that is better(Concept Preservation). I just hope my thoughts are enough to provide you some insight before you do or do not purchase this.\n\nScore Summary: I will start with this so you can circle back to it, and review my overall scores without distancing yourself from each scoring.\n\nAdditionally, I have not tried the internet mutiplayer. I would recommend finding an opinion on that if you're looking to play competitively or with others over the internet. I typically play this hotseat style.\n\n\nGameplay: 6 / 10\nGraphics: 8 / 10\nFunctionality: 7 / 10\nConcept Presrvation: 6 / 10\n\nOverall Score: 6.75 / 10\n---------------------------\nGameplay: 6/10\n\nReasons for docked points.\n-No extended game scaling: Mechanically this could be corrected by added research point spell costs, or specialization research; Which I assume, could actually be patched in. This pretty much makes any large map a real brain drill to endure.\n\n-Limitations on customizations feel too constraining. In the end, you're playing with modules for heroes over depth and flavor. Same problem applies to craftable in game items. Raising the ceiling on  item customization and increasing customization options could radically improve this.\n\n-Really jarring moments in gameplay when moving units in combat and when trying to use commands with simultanous turns mode. Simultanous turns saves time, but often any ai or indepents will move before any player because the engine does not process multiple commands from multiple players in real time. It takes the first command entered.\n\n-Limited usefulness to mechanics of the game. Veterancy chief among them. For all the work of raising a unit naturally to high veterancy and the difficulty of preserving them in battle, the payoff doesn't even feel like it's there. It does influence things, but so marginally that there really isn't a great deal of value to even having it. The only payoffs that truly reward are those with abilities attached to them or evolutions(Don't ever expect to get those easily.) The tier system is good for informative purposes, but as a function of the game, it murders the potential fo the veterancy system. I would've recommended a alternative approach veterancy such as a higher level cap for lower tiers, because it makes sense that weaker units would develop more skills than stronger ones over time; and it would richly reward people for the effort of keeping them alive. Perhaps such a change could be patched in or added with some kind of DLC expansion.\n\nGameplay Review\n\nWhy a six out of ten? Let's begin with the things I like about the game. Fundamentally, what sets this game franchise apart from others to me, is the ability to radically change the environment; This incarnation of the game doesn't just make it visual, it can have a serious impact on the strength of armies if the environment is hostile to them. Morale is a very real thing to this game, and strong positive and negative effects radically alter the behavior of the cities, armies, and heroes that you manage. Affecting or controlling everything from critical hits, to random city behaviors, desertions, and rebellions. (Positive causes surprise good presents(Sudden construction, resource bursts), negative usually means rebellious armies start spawning in the domain.)\n\nThe diplomacy engine has been expanded upon slightly with npcs, with an added alignment system and other behavioral systems to ais. I found that the stronger I got, the less inclined to start a war other ai players would be. A combination of wealth, alignment, military threat, and probably a few other factors I haven't discovered largely control how neutral camps and ai players percieve and interact with you. Players can trade items, cities, forts, the right to enter borders. (If someone declares war on you, they ignore your borders presence when it comes to whether or not they can enter your area..)\n\nYou can create a somewhat customizeable leader with some variances on appearance, skill setup; The lack of options and the hard cap of only 3 specializations hurt the long game. This game really feels like it thrives during a mid game situation. Early battles can be quite difficult if you don't know what you're doing, and I found myself frequently using auto combat, because of the risk it would be to try to run things myself. I'm certain that if I better knew what I was doing, life would be a little better. Late game can get a little empty, as oftentimes... When you hit end-game research, your research points feel kinda wasted,\n\nUnits are divided into seperate tiers, from Tier I. to Tier IV. Despite the option of veterancy, Higher tiers almost ALWAYS win over lower tiers. If you play this game... Pay VERY close attention to your tier setups, and ability setups. You can recruit heroes whom, like your leader, can get stronger as the game progresses. Typically, a naked starting hero has a lot of trouble taking down Tier II-III units. But by the time you finish developing them into whatever you intend to make em do, presuming you did a fair to good job, your heroes will trash Tier IV units. And regardless of whether or not they are in battles, they passively pick up experience as the game progresses.\n\nCombat feels kinda sluggish and jarring, but that is probably because of my personal history and the expectations other franchises have imparted upon me. It was my experience that most minor battles are better spent autoing, and sometimes it's enjoyable to watch the replay of the battle. (Especially since you can accelerate the animation speeds. Which I find myself most comfortable at x2 speed.) There is a certain excitement factor to auto combating a closely matched engagement because of the huge gamble it represents, those also usually make the most interesting combat replays to check out.\n\nI think that covers all the major thoughts I had on gameplay, Let's move on.\n==================\nGraphics: 8 / 10\nReasons for point docking.\n-Graphics errors that have occured.\n-Some visual bug based crashes.\n\nThis section is largely subjective, but I think that the game delivers exactly what it tries to in graphics for the most part. I had some visual glitches here and there, most prominant of which, was a persistant rapid graphic flicker. Creating effects that weren't there, blacking out things that were supposed to be there. Usually these resolved with a game restart. It has only happened a handful of times, and could very easily be an isolated bug to my computer, I cannot be sure.\n==================\nFunctionality: 7 / 10\nReasons for point docking.\n-Visual Bug Crashes\n-Lategame/Veterancy Issues.\n-Simultanous Turn mode is less than satisfactory.\n\nI applaud the inclusing of the game manual as a button inside the game that opens an in-game manual to reference and its great detail.\n\nSimultanous turns is an awful idea when your engine will only take one global command execution at a time. All players should be able to act simultanously and not on a first come first serve basis. I presume the big hang up here is battles, but it should've been simple to think of creating a holding pattern for battles.\n\nThe concept preservation score is a reflection of how I felt the dev team did on delivering us a true sequal; Scored based on keeping/improving concepts of the orginals. I will elaborate further in comments, if I can. I am at the limit sadly. I would be glad to answer questions via messages.","May 7, 2014","true","44.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nisavid/recommended/226840/","nisavid","nisavid","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nisavid/","347 products in account","In this game, the main premise is a large scale rivalry between powerful mages with varying specializations and studies, who bend cities by their will toward good, evil, or whatever.\n\nGameplay is reminiscent mostly of Heroes of Might and Magic, in a good way.  This is a 4X game with an especially strong emphasis on exploration and extermination, with heroes who go questing, conquering, leveling up, and looting for themselves and their empire.  Campaign actions are made on a high-level campaign map.  Battles play out on a lower-level map in a tactical turn-based manner, taking into account the terrain and structures of the tile on the campaign map.  Both maps use hexagonal tiles.  Armies (unit stacks) are composed of up to six units.  In a battle, all adjacent armies participate.  In some ways, this approach to combat feels like a middle ground between Civilization and Total War.\n\nMuch of the design is reminiscent of Master of Magic.  Cities and units vary according to the class of the player and the race of the inhabitants.  There are six classes (arch druid, dreadnought, rogue, sorceror, theocrat, and warlord) and six races (high elf, human, orc, goblin, dwarf, and draconian).  The variety is good but not dizzying, with a solid array of standard unit types and a handful of specialists available in any city that has the requisite buildings.  Spellcasting plays a major role on the campaign map and in battles.  The spells span a wide spectrum from an assortment that is modest in cost and effect to the immensely powerful and expensive high tier.  Each school of magic (among air, earth, fire, water, creation, and destruction) is distinct, with its own characteristic effects and strategies.  The interplay between questing, empire building, warfare, and spellcasting is fun, engaging, and balanced.\n\nCompared to other 4X games, there is a diminished emphasis on exploitation.  Rather, the exploitation here is ultimately focused on serving the exploration and extermination.  You won't find options for cultural, diplomatic, or economic victories here, and the gameplay options are limited likewise.  This is not a game of peace.  [edit: Interestingly, Triumph has hinted that this is an area that they will expand in upcoming updates.]\n\nThe overall fit and finish is very good, although not without room for improvement.  The UI is strongly reminiscent of Civilization V—a good choice of inspiration.  Some aspects live up to this standard better than others.  There is a Tome of Wonders (akin to Civilopedia), but it's a pain to navigate (no back button?!  among other problems), and some of its pages neglect important information.  Some stats show breakdowns on hover, as they should, but some breakdowns lack desirable detail, while others are simply omitted.  I'm curious to see if any of this improves with ongoing updates.\n\nUnlike Civilization and most other games in the 4X genre, a game of Age of Wonders III at normal pace is significantly shorter.  Expect a commitment of three to six afternoons instead of three to six full days.  Considering the pesky existence of real life, this is a very desirable trait.\n\nIf you like 4X and high fantasy, and you'd like a game that combines the two in a form that's easy to swallow, then this is a great choice.","April 14, 2014","true","89.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I was looking for a game to scratch my "Disciples: Sacred Lands" itch and found a game that played like a hybrid of the aforementioned itch and the later games of the "Civilization" franchise. Gameplay is enjoyable and well developed, but not so complicated that it detracts from the over-all experience. Animations such as the number of soldiers in a unit being a visible "health bar" for the overall unit is a nice touch, as are the animations in general. I have had much enjoyment watching my Dwarven Musketeers open fire against the flank of an Orc Spearmen unit. Or my Elven Longbowmen fire wave after wave of arrows into their foes.\n\nThe lore is well done, and not too heavy or crying out for your undivided attention, but there is enough there to get you into the game's mechanics, whilst leaving room for DLC and add on campaigns and scenarios which will help this already interesting game stay fresh. A good soundtrack with a variety of fantasy inspired tracks doesn't hurt either, I have found myself humming along to the soundtrack on more than one occasion. A privilege in strategy games previously only enjoyed by Paradox.\n\nMultiplayer is remincent of other games in the genre. I would recommend playing it with close friends, or people in the same room as big maps with strangers would be a bold, and overly optimistic state of affairs.\n\nAll in all a good experience fully worth the money advertised. I fully expect many hours to be lost to this little gem and would not lament that fact.","July 9, 2014","true","61.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

They're terrible.

You can pick from 6 races with 6 classes for each, each one a little different.  You also get the opportunity to make your own leader using any of the races as a template, each with a modifiable look and modifiable name.\n\nThe gameplay of the game is fun.  As well as your fellow leaders running around, there is the independents, which are all the non-aligned units, ranging from monsters and bandits, to neutral towns that you can either conquer/annihilate for the lulz or convince to join your empire by paying them gold.  Doing this is quite fun despite the ease to simply buy up the cities and also allows you to, with patience to get access to ALL the races for yourcurrent class...or you can be a evil bugger and forcibly migrate your race to these cities.\n\nThis brings me to my first little niggle regarding the AI.  The AI players work with you...unless you do things that ♥♥♥♥ them off and man are they picky.\n\nThey take notes of EVERYTHING you do and it doesn;t take much to upset them to the point that they will launch war after war against you.  While they will forget about these, it takes a LONG time.  In my main game, I noted how my one war against a enemy had given a -1200 rating that would last for nearly 130 turns.\n\nThis also brings up a AI problem I noted regarding these, which involved me getting a war penalty despite the fact that the other guy started it.  That is a bug that needs to be looked at in the least.\n\nThe next part, the combat.  This is similar to Fallen enchantress in that it is a turn based fight on a special map.  Each fight takes place between the two enemies on a hex and the units in the surrounding one.  However, again, evern on dumbest setting, the AI seems suspiciously competent, sending overwelming force against their chosen target.  There is regularly little warning of an attack, meaning you'll lose at least one city before you can get a peace treaty established, which is easy to do, surprisingly.\n\nAI players will happily take a peace treaty, regardless of how well their war is going with you.  While I welcome this given how war happy my neighbours are in my current game, it is a little boring and easy to avoid a war thats going badly.\n\nUnits, research and spells are next.  Like Fallen enchantress, you get to research a series of abilities/spells and units, ranging from mounted units to the local racial units depending on what race city you have up to, the kick ♥♥♥ juggernort 'land-ship' which is basically a 'I Win' unit.  You also get a nice selection on hero units, the cap of which you can limit.\n\nSpells however are also pretty good, and are unique to your chosen magic abilities and your class.  They have good veriaty, many have useful impact and are fun (the dreadnoughts 'mana core' nuke is just fun and a great mifddle finger to give a enemy thats overwelming you), ranging from the terraforming abilities, in-battle attacks unique to your heroes and world improvement spells such as the dreadnoughts 'supress nature; that removes all terrein penalties.\n\nHowever, my biggest problem is with the story campaign.  The difficulty there is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.  Half way into the FIRST MISSION...I was swarm attacked by about 30 units out no nowhere by a enemy I hadn;t even met.  This NEEDS to be patched ASAP but is not too big a problem in the long term of things\n\nIn conclusion, AoW3 is a great game that sits up there with the civilization and Fallen enchantress series's.  It has some bugs but its only just been released and I have no doubt that Triumph Studioes will fix these problems and game balance issues.\n\nIf you like the sid meier games and Galactic Civilization games, you'll love this game too.\n\nFinal rating:  9/10\n\nIt loses a point due to the unbalanced AI.","April 3, 2014","true","17.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

After I wrapped around the controls which for whatever reason seemed backwards (left and right mouse buttons would be vise versa if i made things lol), I got pretty into the game and keep coming back. Although I could say a lot more, I am going to summarize things in bullet form as best i can and I will likely miss some things:\n\nThinks I think that could be improved:\n\n-The research tree is still rather baffling if you want to plan ahead or unlock certain things unless you have played a lot. If it was set up like in civilization with some kind of flow chart it would be a lot easier to prioritize.\n\n-Combat animations are kinda crumby with the units (i'm just whining nothing that harms the game)\n\n-The hero cannot die clause. Warcraft 2 all over again. In the campaign you basically just keep your hero in the back away from harm and cast spells unless you want him focus'ed by the AI and to reload your save. Personally I think the hero's need more durability else they essentially just play a support role for most of the fight, cuz when they die everything stops. You aren't going to siege a city without those wonderful buffs they give all the units in the army pack nor will you go and explore ruins/want to fight if a hero isn't milking exp.\n\n-The exp system, it should essentially award everyone in the army attacking or not. Win a battle: gain most exp, lose a battle: hero gets some exp everyone else is dead lol, Run from a battle get no exp (since running could be abused). I essentially just have hero use a ranged ability to kill off whatever i can (safely) as to net more exp.\n\n-The AI during sieges, if you have 2 trebuchets you can basically funnel all the enemies through a narrow hole in the wall, ive beat a few "very likely defeat" situations abusing this with a very small army. If the enemy is more numerous then you past a certain extent they should just bum rush you out the gates and cut u off instead of hole up and get picked off.\n\n-Spellcasting seems kind of wonky, losing your hero for casting oil skin almost doesnt seem worth it... some spells should perhaps count as your cast and not your hero turn and the more powerful will take both...\n\nThings I dont understand yet....:\n\n-I still have no idea the use of teraforming whatsoever. Ive never encountered any situation where i would want to change my land type. Nor have unhappy people, nor really see any issues being good/evil.\n\n-Why we have so many damn resources, gold is fine for the most part, but mana crystals im always swimming in them early on and for the rest of the scenario.\n\nThings that shine:\n\n-Battles are really fun when in the open areas with a lot of obstacles around.\n\n-The unique units are quite diverse so far from what i see\n\n-Game isn't the prettiest but I really like the looks of everything\n\n-campaign is enjoyable and each level takes a fair bit of time to complete thoroughly and im just playing on easy mode to speed through~ u get a lot of playtime in this game!\n\n-The voice acting is quite good, I love the intro dialogues they are read very very well.\n\nIf you want my comments on anything be sure to post and ask ill give my 2 cents.\n\nHope this is useful lol","April 18, 2014","true","31.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Let's start with that.\n\nThe command, unlike some other games, namely Fallen Enchantress, which is the main comparrison I'll be making, is rather dull. It takes about 25-70 turns, depending on what's in its domain, to complete the city entirely, and each city has to make that trek and the only real thing that changes it is the Raze, Plunder and Migrate options for each city, which is a nice touch, since each race has its own benefits.  Compared to Fallen Enchantress, though, the cities feel... Dull. It's the same path each time, and once you get all your class specific units, the entire war units tree is useless. One main problem I have with it, and this is a personal quipe, but oh well, is that the cities just suddenly... get taken over. Anything above a city I'm practically yelling at the screen with the general rage when a group of SCOUT units, which literally are so easy to kill that a tier four takes 1 damage to them, takes over your throne city/any other metropolis. That was a major turn off for me.\n\nNow, onto the war section. The combat is probably the most fun I've had in a 4X. It's really slick, it carries weight, and the seiges are fun. The general feel of the units are amazing, with specific combinations practically winning seiges and battles. The units all have unique rolls on the battlefield, some are tanks that don't deal much damage, or a "Give them the plague!" units that makes whatever they attack weaker. And one of my favorite, and at the same time least favorite, mechanics is that each battlefield consists of six hexes that each unit on takes part in. But then comes the little problem of top teir units being stacked and being literally impossible in a city to dislodge. And the units that aren't inside the gates on the map spawning on the battlefield suddenly inside it. That irritated me that you couldn't just send an army to fight one another. But, despite the units unique to each faction, I kept feeling the same feeling of "These are rather generic units" at the end of the game, since every end game unit tends to be what you'd expect. They should flesh it out a lot more and add either entire unit customization or just athestic customization. Oh. And heroes are practically useless unless you totally defend them with everything, since they're so low health and defence.\n\nThe explore and expand elements are generally how it feels in other games, use the explore to get loot and make more of the same generic city over the map. And don't even get me started on how useless the neautral city AI are. They're there for one purpose: Be conquered!\n\nAll in all, though, I'd say it's an amazing game with its problems that can be fixed with just a smidge of effort, or if a modder is willing, they could always fix it.\n\nOverall opinion: For me, personally, I like more diplomancy and less masses of war units everywhere. 8/10. I recommend it, I got my money's worth out of it.","May 8, 2014","true","80.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

For a long time though it seems like the genre has peaked with classics like Master of Magic, and Heroes of Might an Magic 3. The latter being a personal favorite of mine. Now after a long wait we are getting games that are really good again like Fallen Enchantress, and Warlock. Age of Wonders 3 however is probably my new favorite out of all of them.\n\nYou can tell when playing it that the designer has probably played all of the games I mentioned above, and more. The game takes many good ideas of those titles incorporating in with some good ideas of it's own. The result feels really solid. Almost like a greatest hits album of the genre. It's important to know though that the title is focused more on the competitive element. This isn't an empire builder like Civ where you can sit in a corner, and focus on culture or something. It's built as a war game. Those that go into understanding that, and craving it will have a better time.","June 29, 2014","true","152.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Your character travels the map, explores locations, and takes controll of resource points.  Combat isn't as developed as HoMM.  Your troops are deployed randomly and your find yourself really missing being able to line up your troops as you see fit.  Also lacks the variety of HoMM's tactical combat options for your units.\n\nThe game also strongly reminds you of Elemental Fallen enchantress.  You can send out units to colonize and expand your realm.  Building different buildings expands the zone of controll for each city.  It falls a little short of the Elemental comparison with the lack of RPG elements and the variety of items to equip your character with.\n\nThe storyline for the two campaigns is decent, the single female voice actress does a great job, but you find yourself wishing for a few animated cutscenes to spice things up.  Each mission is more or less the same.  Build up your troops and take out your enemies.  It can get a little stale after about 20 hours though.","May 17, 2014","true","39.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It looks and sounds great, runs smoothly, and (unlike most of the venerable fantasy TBS,) has an AI that actually shows up and tries to win.  However, if you go into the game with the same attitude that you might have in the older games, you might not have much fun.\n\nAge of Wonders III is about conquest and fighting.  Everything you do in this game must drive you to this goal.  You cannot explore the map lazily looking for secrets, build armies of "fluff" because dwarf axemen are cool, or waste your mana terriforming cities when the enemy is at the gates.  In this game you have to constantly be on the lookout for ways to exploit the map, and for enemies to come out of nowhere.  By the end of the game, the surviving empires may be two giant war machines endlessly pumping units at each other from across the map (thankfully, rally points have been added.)  The last battles will, in drawn out cases, consist entirely of massive stacks of the most powerful units.  This may or may not be okay with people.\n\nI'll admit, I'm the kind of person who wants his last army to look like something from Lord of the Rings, just a huge mass of swords and bows being thrown at a huge mass of orcs.  Sadly, that will rarely happen, as this huge mass of men would just be slaughtered by a smaller mass of dragons, giants, war machines or those horrible Manticore Riders.  Indeed, I was a bit frustrated when my army of dwarven crossbowmen behind a stone wall was slaughtered by a handful of these units.  I guess what I'm trying to say with this is that this game will not make you feel like you are really leading an army of fantasy creatures in a great war.  Neither does a game of Magic the Gathering, but it sure is fun.\n\nOn the subject of the AI, if you leave it alone, then you will see it turning into a massive war machine with the aforementioned rallypoints and Tier 4 units slogging across the map.  AI Knight has learned a few things since Age of Wonders II.  While it is still possible to see some tactical blunders (suiciding flyers for example) it puts up a better fight than most without extra help.  Admittedly, I haven't seen if it gets any, but I haven't noticed anything from it that made me call foul.\n\nIf I have to criticize it, it would be that most games play pretty much the same, requiring a similar strategy from the player to win based on race and class choice, and the layout of the map, while it may throw occaisional curveballs at you, has little to do with how things progress.  But in that criticism I just described many games that are perfectly fine, as is this one (Heroes of Might and Magic series might be the exception there, but look how good the last one of those was...)  The fun in a game like that is to optimize that strategy to perfect it, while someone across the battlefield from you tries to counter it.  The game's AI does not forgive you if you screw up.\n\nReally if I wanted to throw out things I'd like, it'd be some degree of city specialization (choose between buildings rather than just build everything everywhere,) more options for creating items and creating/leveling characters, and maybe some map structures that can change the course of the game (special unit recruitment, buffs to city created units such as Master of Magics "Adamantium Deposits") and so on.  Also, with all the terriforming and terrain changing options, I want terrain to mean more to me during the game.  Maybe I'm just not paying attention to it, but right now, I only terriform for a little extra gold from cities and for looks.  Its still cool though, changin the world into a frozen wasteland or a sweltering jungle.  I do miss the Shadow World though, and the Dark Elves, and the Nomads, hell, even the Halflings, but I am sure I'll see them all again.\n\nThere will be DLC, and I will pay for it.  The game world can only get bigger and better, and Triumph really seems to be putting all their effort into it.\n\ntldr: Its very fun.  And competitive.  Its not building an epic empire in a grand story, its all about stomping your enemies into the dirt.  And it ends like Clash of the Titans except with more Titans.  Its not Age of Wonders II, but Age of Wonders II didn't magically disappear or anything.  And you can make a Dwarf Succubus.

The game will immediately feel familiar, while new game mechanics do not feel forced in. Overall, each race still plays like their predecessors, but each leader type will put a twist on your force composition.\n\nIf you are new to Age of Wonders, this is a Turn Based Strategy game that is based on a series that has been around for some time. Age of Wonders III is similar (but superior) to games like Disciples, and Heroes of Might and Magic. Other similar titles would include Warlock, and Fallen Enchantress. The basics of it are you build an army, learn new spells, and march your gathered army to victory. On the main map, you can cast spells to help you and your allies or hinder your foes. You can explore the map for powerful items to equip your leader and heroes with. When you fight another army you switch to a tactical battle mode. Here, you will command your troops individually, and you are also able to cast magic to aid them.\n\nThis is not a fast paced game, and larger maps can take a long time to finish. There are some minor issues, such as AI Diplomacy being touchy, however this game excels at Multiplayer as its previous iterations have. The campaign allows you to play both sides of the main conflict, and the achievements allude to 2 endings per side.","April 7, 2014","true","76.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Learning the gameplay might take a tad bit but when you start playing you'll find yourself bargaining time away just so you can play one more turn. The single player is pretty much where most people start, in order to learn the game mechanics and the game does that pretty well, by the time I got to the thrid level I was already building proper armies, upgrading cities, and destroying other empires. The game's AI is smart even on easy and you will find them hitting your weak points if you underestimate them while the hardest difficulty pushes you to use everything in your power to win, also although you can build alliances with the AI it is actually very hard to do so because most of the time they're in it for themselves but then again so are we so peace most of the time will not be in your options. You can also fight the battles yourself on a field but after awhile I just kept using auto battle unless it was a battle that I needed to be won then I took control but do know that one level can take a long time to complete because you'll be managing your cities, planning strategies for the future, or something else which will take time unless you're blitzing all the time.

First of all, let's start off with the positives about this game. The graphics are excellent and there is a lot of replay value in this game. The storyline is very interesting if these type of RPG games interest you as this is one of those turn-based games with a somewhat unpredictable outcome. So carefull planning is advisable. I like the scenario mode the best as the Draconians is my preferred clan that I like to use that is leaded by Rish Kyan. While I am not going to spoil anything. You will have to play the game yourself to fully experience it. The game also has multiplayer mode when you can play matches against your friends. So that is some of the good parts that this game has but the major downside is with the AI as in my experiences and with two days of not much progress. From what I have learned is that if you upgrade and max out your units. The AI will be much stronger and tougher to beat and in some cases. The AI is not that well balanced from my experiences of playing this game as it is just too aggressive in easy mode for a casual gamer which can be frustrating. All in all. that is the only one major downside to an otherwise a very enjoyable game :).\n\nOverall Rating: 7/10.","May 31","true","47.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

A 9 out of 10 game right now for me. But I might be a bit biased, being a long term fan of 15 years with this series. But I recommend it to everyone who enjoy this kind of games.","June 25, 2015","true","165.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I have always been a fan of strategy, whether it be turn-based or real-time, but also have like many other genres too. I have many games that compete for my limited game time, but this one is winning hands-down at the moment.\n\nWhile there are some definite 'Heroes of Might and Magic' parallels, it feels much more holistic. The tactical fighting is great, and just gets better the more I learn about the units and the mechanics. The leveling system for each unit is great, and makes you really try to keep the unit alive, granting better powers and giving each experienced unit a sense of being less 'replaceable' by the next newly produced unit. This means that rather than sending them to their doom just to finish the battle faster, or being too careless or clumsy, you really want to make sure they get involved (to get more xp), but keep them from sacrificing themselves for a worthless cause.\n\nThe Heroes are great, and with so much customisation as they level up, it leaves you forever wishing you had more points to throw at their skills. This also makes it juicily special when they level up. And, even better is that it can really make a difference to the battles, whether it be the spells that enhance your 'shock troopers' to take and dish-out a heap of punishment, or enhancing your hero so they themselves become a mobile game-changer wherever they tread.\n\nThe city development is interesting too. It does not boast the most exhaustive list of buildings, but in the early-mid game it promotes the development of a city so that it specialises in one or two troop types. I really like this because it means you can plan your overall strategy with more effectiveness. Including thinking about how to get your slow-moving troops to the enemy - do you build them in the close cities, or build roads between cities, or keep each city more generic and have lower level or lower tiered troops. Lots of delicious approaches.\n\nAnother big plus is the ability to play offline. Which is great as I often travel. Cloud auto-saves can also help me progress on either my PC or laptop.\n\nIf you like strategy, and multiple approaches to victory - then this game is for you. Heroes class and race make a difference, and the constant difficult choice of which spells and skills to choose is fantastic. Runs surprisingly well on low specs too.\n\nCons - can't save the game mid-way through a battle, music is not amazing (but who really plays these games for the music).\n\nPlease enjoy!","May 23, 2015","true","85.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The tactical battles are fun and are Age of Wonder's main component. On the downside, the storyline gets tedious as you seem to reset your progress as you move to each map. Instead of following one team of epic heroes from the beginning to the end, you are constantly introduced to new heroes that you need to level up to make them useful in a fight. Following a single team throughout the entire game would have been a more fun and rewarding experience. After completing several scenarios I grew bored with the structure of the game and continuously having to burn through turn after turn just to explore a new map. If you don't mind the tedium, the tactics battles are worth the meandering storyline and slow-paced campaign interface.","July 22, 2015","true","99.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

But I felt intrigued enough to keep playing. Then I slowly started unraveling the intricacies and the secrets and I got absolutely hooked.\n\nThe biggest draw for me, is the degree of customisation it offers. There are literally dozens of combinations of race/class/specialisation combined with random maps which are quite configurable, and a lot of different tweaks for each game map. One game you might be playing a Frostling Sorcerer with master destruction and rain death (and stun) on your foes, next game a Dwarf Theocrat rising from the caves below the surface to conquer everything, specializing in wild magic with unpredictable results. Then a Tigran Warlord Grey Guard, bashing down all opposition. Then later you might revisit the Frostling sorcerer, but be lucky enough to have a building that makes your Ice Queens practically immortal (if you end up winning the fight) inside your domain.\n\nWhat I'm getting at, is not only are all of these options extremely fun to play around with and figure out interesting and powerful combinations, but they offer a replayability rarely seen in games.\n\nReally this game is amazing and you should check it out if you are a fan of Turn Based Strategy games.

This game, instead, celebrates its complexity by finely balancing it and making everything in the game be worth using, even Tier 1 units which in nearly every other game (including its predecessors) become obsolete by mid-game.\nThe turns play fast, battle auto-resolving works acceptably well and actually simulates the battles instead of making an oddball calculation based on numbers. You have the option to make your heroes survive auto-resolved battles if you win them (to avoid the strong annoyance of the CPU suiciding your heroes), thus relieving you of a lot of unwanted micromanagement.\nThe tactical battles in the game are detailed, very enjoyable, and also optional! —since the auto-resolve feature plays fine—. You can replay auto-resolved battles to learn the game's complex tactical combat by watching the computer (I learned partly that way).\n\nThe graphics, music and interface of the game are excellent. If you play with low detail graphics you may have Age of Wonders II flashbacks  =)  specially with antialiasing off. You can run this game in moderately old hardware (something other modern games can't).\n\nExcellent Turn-Based Strategy Game, a personally refreshing sight after failures like Civilization: Beyond Earth and Heroes VI. Get it on a discount sale if you're hesitant. I'm sure you'll be buying the expansions rather soon  =)\n\n( The expansions added new victory conditions and even more variety to an already spicy game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jingobingonfinky/recommended/226840/","jingobingonfinky","Minitrue","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jingobingonfinky/","152 products in account","A 4x fantasy game that has all the elements you could wish for, allowing it to make a real challenge at being arguably the best in its genre. But does it live up to its sparkle ?\n\nIf you're old enough to remember Master of Magic, then you will know the precursor game that AoW III has built itself on. If you're not old enough, then AoW is a game of the same family as Warlock, or any of the fantasy mods for Civ. A turn based fantasy game you will spend your time exploring a map, expanding your empire, exploiting resources and finally exterminating your enemies. A 4x to the core. Whilst there have been innumerable takes on this formula, AoW III promises to bring all these things together with a decent rub of polish and just enough depth to really please the 4x audience.\n\nAnd in many ways the game does just that - a nice tactical combat system that brings depth to the strategic map manoeuvres without overstaying its welcome. A diverse and interesting number of resources to exploit. Bucketfuls of different army units and racial types. And so on.\n\nBut despite all this, and despite it looking great, the game has some flaws. And when you get to playing it, those flaws really start to bite.\n\nThe first flaw is the simultaneous move implementation. Turn based games can turn into a tedious snore fest if they opt for a me go you go type mechanic. Fortunately in this day and age such things are rare ( with the exception of the woeful coding of Warlock ), but in AoW III the simultaneous movement has a hitch. Everything and everyone moves simultaneously - players, AI kingdoms, independents. And the AI has a beautifully machine like grief play style where it can wait for you to make a single move somewhere, before rolling forward its units to sneak in the back door and take that town from you.\n\nWoops.\n\nSo maybe you shouldn't move out of that town. At all. Ever. A bizarre nervouse mexican stand off ensues where the AI stares you down waiting for you to misclick or even just investigate a passing army before rushing in to capitalise. And it's no good clicking once you've taken that step - particularly if you are playing in a multiplayer network game - as the whole thing then lags and chugs busy processing its own fabulously griefing move whilst your frantic clicks can sit and wait.\n\nIn practice the simultaneous movement with AIs on the field of play quickly becomes irritating - and it starts to warp play into some neurotic twitch fest. It's not the first game to implement this type of nervous who clicks first simultaneous play, but here, combined with a simplistic "IS IT OK FOR ME TO ATTACK NOW" state AI, it can often prove enormously frustrating.\n\nFortunately simulaneous movement is optional.\n\nNon simultaneous movement then goes back to the tedious me go you go turn order. But at least you can go out explore something and be home for tea without the griefing AI kicking your door down mid journey. Well. Mostly.\n\nThe second flaw to the game is that towns don't have an implicit defence. That is to say, if a town is empty, anyone can just walk in and take it. Sound reasonable ? Sure. What's the problem ? Remember that hair trigger wait for you to move "IS IT OK TO ATTACK NOW" AI ? It's still here. And as soon as you even look like you are leaving somewhere empty or under strength, then with annoying regularity the AI marches an army up. I couldn't swear to it, but the AI also has an uncanny knack to "know" when you have left somewhere light, and proceeds to quickly march from over the horizon to its target goal. Meh.\n\nIn practice with the AI staring you down waiting for you to set a single foot outside your door, you end up with the gratuitous full army stack just sitting kicking its heels defending a town. FOR THE REST OF THE GAME. You can see why many games just abstract city defence away, as it's a no brainer you want to always defend a city.\n\nBut maybe you're ok with that. Seeing a stack of troops in every town, and the maintenance of them - the retiring of old redundant units, the creating of new  better ones, and the whines from their heroes as they slowly level up, and the movement difficulties getting around that fat stack is fine. No problem.\n\nThird flaw in the game. Unit balance. As you proceed up your tech tree, most units become pretty much worse than useless. In fact, if you are not spamming out your top tier units, then you're probably doing it wrong. And if those low tier units do engage those high tier ones ? Splat. Well ! That's just the march of progress ! That's to be expected ! Except it's kind of broken here. In something like Civ your units in the field will get dragged through the ages with an upgrade - that unit of Warriors you've had kicking around since 4000BC are now some fancy 20th century Infantrymen. And you will no longer be able to produce those ancient warriors. In AoW there is no such handling. Those idiot Tier I guys will still be walking around. Sucking up resources. Bloating out stacks. And you can go right on producing those stick wielding primitives right into the era of "space travel" - the highest tiers. Which is kind of pointless. And irritating. So for all those fancy units, it ends up just a race for the highest tier - with a few exceptions. The subtleties of rock paper scissors are quickly washed away in a My Tank beats EVERYTHING you have.\n\nFourth flaw in the game, and this really does spoil the game, is the nature of the AI. The AI is the worst kind of griefing AI - the kind of player that will happily sit there and repeat play the same chequers move until eternity, just so they stop you winning. It's a sad fact that to placate the human player customer base, an AI has to sometimes take the higher road, the non optimal choice and  break out of that loop of incessant taunting moves. In AoW the AI has no such good sportsmanship tendencies and will happily bounce armies back and forth as you trigger each AI decision tree. Move to the left ? Your enemy to the right will charge. Move to the right ? Your enemy to the left will charge. Quickly go back the other direction ? Your enemies will mirror your move. Rinse and repeat.\n\nSo the AI is tricky you think. What's the issue ? You're just whining about a hard AI !\n\nThe AI is not hard particularly. Just annoying. As are the other issues with the game. All of which combines in a perfect storm to produce a game that after a while becomes just plain irritating. You don't have fun. It becomes like managing an annoying spoiled nephew. Until you question why you are even playing the stupid game, and hell doesn't Civ or Warlock give a  much more enjoyable experience ?\n\nAnd there's the problem. AoW has all the right bits, all the right polish and yet... through a few interesting design choices... manages to trip over and face plant to produce an annoying not quite there game.\n\nThe irritating aspects of the game do shine through - and until recently another annoying ( And pointless ? ) aspect of game play was an AI that would endlessly spam dispells. Sound tactics ? Sure. Annoying griefy play that tends to break any possible use of global spells ? Yes. It's something that you can see hasn't really been thought about how it plays out. It's an AI which is not good at playing humans - it's good at playing itself.\n\nIf you were being very harsh, you might almost say someone looked at all the requested things for a 4x, mixed them together and baked for half an hour - but without any clue whatsoever as to what *tastes good*.\n\nAt its best there is a good game somewhere in AoW. At it's worst its an annoying experience with a minor sprinkling of bugs to spice things up a bit.\n\nPersonally I am still perservering with it - I like the bits that are good, and it can play for a while as a nice game, on the other hand I really hate the bits that fail, they really jar you out of the game and produce a frustrating, lets go play something else type vibe.","May 1, 2014","false","44.2"," 16 of 30 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","16","30","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MannyStillwagon/recommended/226840/","MannyStillwagon","Manny Stillwagon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MannyStillwagon/","46 products in account","In brief: A game with a fantastic concept that lacks the depth and balance to hold the player's attention.\n\nIn not so brief:\nI was really excited about this game. I saw some gameplay and got it on the Steam Winter Sale after waiting forever for the price to drop. I was excited by the combination of strategic overworld combined with tactical combat and thought it would make for dynamic and immersive gameplay. To go with the Civilization comparison I had always wished the combat there was more detailed / more engaging and I thought this was the answer. Unfortunately I fails to live up to expectations.\n\nYou choose class and race and those determine what "special units" you get and some specialized bonuses and abilities. Unfortunately, the special units are little more than reskins of the same basic types. You have infantry, calvary, and archers. And your specialized units are only "special" in a few details. Once you get to mid-game you've figured out the most efficient way to conduct your battles in the tactical map and so just rinse-and-repeat through the entire late-game. You end up hitting "auto-combat" more and more because it's no longer exctiting to spend 7 minutes to crush some bandits. And at that ponit you're no longer even playing the tactical portion. Every tactical map is effectively the same, and so each battle progresses the same way.\n\nThere is no other choice than "crush all your enemies in combat". While in Civ you can win through economics, diplomacy, or culture, in AoW III it is ONLY through conquest. Well that's fine, right? Because you came to play a fantasy strategic/tactical combat game. That's what I thought. But this affects the AI a LOT. Peace treaties are a joke. The AI will propose them, and then break them only a few turns later. There's no real penalty for doing so and in the end they have no other choice. They HAVE to fight you at some point. So forming alliances in game doesn't really work. As a result, the AI is pumping out units at a high rate. Which just turns the game into an arms race. You don't have time to focus on the unique terraforming spells or anything that's not directly combat related. It's just a sprint to get to late-game units so you can stand up to the AI. Which means you probably get there before even exploring the entire map. So the late game is dominated by just cleaning up the rest of your opponents. Sure, now you have the flexibility to play with terraforming or something, but why bother? The game is almost over.\n\nOne final thing is that some of the background game mechanics are broken. Empire Happiness is notably problematic. You gain happiness for a number of things but most importantly for conquering other cities. You lose happiness for such things as losing cities. Happiness determines how well your troops perform in combat. The result of this is that once you get an enemy on their heels it's lights out. It becomes a runaway effect where you just get better and better and they get worse and worse. Instead of long campaigns being tiring for your troops, it's almost invigorating. Additionally, your throne city is EVERYTHING. As in, if you lose that, you lose it all. Literally. Keeping your throne city is a victory requirement. So you can't turtle in a lesser city off to the side to make a brilliant comeback later. If you lose that it's game over. So the easiest way to defeat an opponent is to walk past all of their other cities, go right to their throne, and take it. The end.\n\nI could say more but this review is already overly long. I really, deeply wish I could recommend this game, but it's simply not worth it. Like I said a fantastic concept that falls flat when it comes to execution. If you want to play a turn-based strategy game, play Civ. If you want to play a turn based tactical game, play X-COM. If you want to play a fusion of the two, wait for something better to come along.","January 18, 2015","false","16.1"," 19 of 36 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","19","36","0","0"

The research has been streamlined as well, and while there are a LOT more tech trees they have all been pruned to accommodate the scope. IE: before you picked your school(s) of magic and that was your tech tree. Now you have 6 classes each with their own tech tree, spell schools, and optional tech for expander or explorers (they got rid of the 20 traits from before)\n\nFor those who have not played any AoW games, you will be happy to know that this game is the most faithful spin-off / clone of the original "Masters of Magic", the game that started it all for many of us. AoW 3 feels like a bridge between Heroes of Might and Magic and Civilization 5.\n\nGreat game with only minor bugs so far... many multiplayer issues but I am sure that will be ironed out with time.

Solid Civ-lite overworld, fun tactical combat ala XCOM, REASONABLE AI, and a fun world chock full of flavor.

To start its fair to say this game is the offspring of Civilization 5 and XCOM: Enemy Unknown all set in a fantasy realm with magic and different races. You have large scale geographically diverse maps that allow you to build individual cities and armies to form a massive empire. Strategy and tactics have to be considered as all combat is done in standalone battlefields, not the overworld. The tile of the defender determines the actual battlefield; I was on attacked on a bridge, outnumbered 2:1 and I won the fight because I funneled the attackers onto this narrow bridge and let them have it. Age of Wonders 3 merges the best things about Civilization 5 and tactical games like XCOM to make a game that really reminds of you the choices you've made and the paths you lead.\n\nPros:\n- Stunning graphics\n- In depth tactical battles\n- Intelligent AI\n- Varied multi-tier units and spells/abilities\n- Robust leader customization\n- Two campaigns; divided by difficulty and are very lengthy\n- Features Underground tunnels/caves to add an extra layer to the map\n- Alt+Tab friendly :)\n\nCons\n- Steep learning curve, most advanced concepts aren't taught in the campaign until you've learned them the hard way\n- DRM online only, have to sign up for a third-party account to play\n- May take over your entire day if not careful\n\nFinal Score = 90% / 100%\n\n","September 28, 2014","true","32.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It takes the core elements of great tactics style RPGs, and throws them inside a slightly simplified empire building game a la Civilization V.\n\nI can acknowledge that the strategic portion of the game lacks some of the depth that can be found in the most hardcore strategy games, but I do not feel this is a flaw. One of the greatest games ever devised, Chess, has only 6 unique pieces, and in its standard style of play, only allows for 1v1 competition. There is a delightfully simple elegance to the units and technologies available in AoWIII (which offer many more choices than Chess). Taken from a purely turn-based strategy game perspective, they would seem shallow compared to the game's peers, but in the context of a deep turn-based tactical RPG (with heroes levelling from 1-30, earning skill points to allocate each level, and spells to research, and gear to equip) it is plenty complex enough.\n\nMy favorite thing about this game is how amazingly stable my multiplayer experience has been.  My first time launching online multiplayer, it checked my connectivity rating, and told me it was poor due to firewall settings. I clicked a link provided in-game, and in a totally crisp and not buggy fashion, minimized my client and sent me to the company's help page, wherein I was given the neccessary port to forward. I did so, had the game check again, and was good to go. A friend and I have long searched for a good co-operative tactical RPG experience. The best I have yet found was FFT: The Lion War for PSP. It's a shame that a hand-held game system has trumped PC for so long in this niche. XCOM lacks co-op campaign functionality, Eador is horribly buggy and unstable, and the others I've tried are all crumby. In AoWIII, I've found that harmonious combination of enjoyable gameplay and completely (and I mean 8 straight hours of addictive, no crashes or disconnections) stable multiplayer.\n\nWatch some videos of this game and decide if it suits your interests, but as for my opinion, I can give this one an A+.","September 23, 2014","true","328.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game doesnt have things like base building but allows you to terramorph and expand your domain and some things like a better diplomacy system and more ways to customize your characters and cities would improve the game a ton.  Overall this is a very solid game and well worth your money if you enjoy strategy.","September 22, 2014","true","19.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If you want fantasy battles look no further.\n\nLonger Version: A lot of people compare this game to Fallen Enchantress or Civ, and I think that comparison does very little justice to any of the games involved.  All three games are 4X games in that you can explore, exploit, expand, and exterminate enemies, but have very different focuses.  In general, Civilization games thrive on the first three "x"s but have awful, boring warfare.  Fallen Enchantress is well-rounded, with decent battles and interesting RPG mechanics, but ultimately leaves a lot of the exploitation to be desired.  AoW 3 would be at the extreme opposite Civ: the battles are great, and, nominally, so are the other x's, but there is very little to do with any resource except use it to eXterminate.  The good news is that battles are a lot of fun with dozens of well-balanced, interesting units and lots of great spells.","September 22, 2014","true","68.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This is primarily a quibble on the look of the game based on versions 1 & 2. Particularly in the strategic map, I feel that the new version lacks on a certain visual feedback that the old ones had that made them look more woundrous and magical than the new version does. You may not agree with me on this, and that's fine, it really doesn't affect the gameplay.\n\nThe hero creation is interesting and varied, and the hero that leads your army has a significant impact on gameplay as the units/spells available vary depending on your choices. There are interesting items you can get, including a variety of mounts. I still wish this part was a bit more fleshed out, but it's still enough to make that part of the game interesting.\n\nLarge campaign maps take forever and a day to complete, which sounds great but I still have yet to finish one.\n\nI've spent very little time in the game's campaign, I usually just play random maps.","September 23, 2014","true","79.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I have enjoyed this game very much.  The classes seem to be very similar and playing them doesn't really require a different strategy for each.  Fewer balanced classes that played differently would have been more enjoyable but very few games have ever gotten that formula right.  I also find that occasionally I can win a difficult battle with autocombat ex:  (two six man armies each led by a hero against four fliers and a hunter in a city) that I couldn't win manually and vice versa ex: (I beat an eight man army lead by a hero with three elven archers).  Not sure what that's about but if I redo a battle a bunch of times and get my butt kicked I can occasionally win it with autocombat.  Also a little frustrating when my hero doesn't get disjunction to research during a random game but oh well makes for a challenge.","September 18, 2014","true","218.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/calar8/recommended/226840/","calar8","calar","http://steamcommunity.com/id/calar8/","227 products in account","Ya, this game is really solid. I should preface this my saying my favorite genre of all time is turn based strategy, and while I usually prefer more focused experiences like Final Fantasy Tactics or Fire Emblem, every so often I like to go for a grander 4X game. That said, as a long time strategy fan, this game hits almost every note right with me.\n\nFirst off, while this game is great, it does have a few minor issues that I would like to address before betting to the good stuff. The pace of the game can get very slow, especially when running large maps with many opponents. This can be compounded by the fact that you cant auto manage your cities and my inherant distrust for auto-resolving battles. Additionally, The simultaneous turn system feels a bit funky, and will often cause you to be ambushed mid turn before you can move your armies. This of course is easily fixed by changing the turns to classic.\n\nAside from those issues, the game plays great. There is a tone of variety in units between various combinations of races and classes and tons of neutral units that you will fight in your travels. The customization of heroes is insane and will give any hardcore strategy fan something to sink their teeth into. Best off all though is the execution of strategy in battles. Units die very easily which causes you to apply proper strategy to keep your army alive. Additionally, the game averts the turtling problem of many games of the genre by allowing multiple armies to attack a single hex at a time. This creates huge epic battles that blow games like HoMM out of the water while averting the frustration that comes from having a vastly superior army but being unable to take a single well defended city. Finally, the AI feels smart and a worthy advisary to challenge your dominion.\n\nOverall, this game outpaces most of its competition in its genre. It has more than enough depth for any strategy fan while still being accessable and easy to pick up. If you are a strategy fan, you owe it to yourself to try this game.","April 9, 2014","true","94.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I can't recall how many hours I dumped into those games, especially the second one.  It was the reinvention of Master of Magic, and I loved it.  You get the great world map combined with many fantastic races and tactical combat on separate maps.  I could not have been happier.  It was the fantasy version of Civilization in many respects.\n\nWhen I saw AoW3, I got anxious.  Finally it released, and I got to play it.  It truly has everything to remind me of the previous versions I loved, and then some.  Random Maps, finally.  Relevant units, yay.\n\nAoW3 has random maps.  This seems normal, but previously they did not.  So after a while, it becomes mundane with the same strategies and outcomes per scenario.  You can build cities!  Couldn't do that in the old days.  It was all preset and you took what was already there.  Units are relevant now.  In AoW2 the best strategy was to raze every single building and town you took (except your starting city), then destroy the neutral armies that appeared, and farm all the xp and items you could for your starting hero. He becomes nigh invincible, even to tier 3 units, and has absurd movement with flight, so he can just zoom around the map with a scorched earth strategy.  I have not tried to do this in AoW3, but I suspect it would be ineffective.\n\nIf you liked the previous games in the series, you will still like this one. I cannot say anything bad about it. It is in line with everything I expected it to have. It stays true to the series, and offers some new things. The only thing it doesn't have, is the number of races that the priors had.  No Dark Elves, no Undead, etc... DLC right?  Seems fine.\n\nAll that being said, I would go 8/10 if you like the genre or the old games.  Personally, it's a 7 for me, and that is just because although I want to enjoy the battles and fight them manually, they become something of a chore to me and I end up auto'ing most of them, even if its a huge super important fight.  I would not have the patience anymore for multiplayer if people do manual fights, yet the prospect of not having the option to manual fight seems to gut a large aspect of the game's draw for me.\n\nSo I recommend this game overall, but you mind get a little bored with it if you have leaned towards RTS style games since playing AoW2, and maybe that's not worth the cost of the game for you.  Even so, it's a fine product and I am happy to support it, even if I don't play it as much as I thought I would.
