The story looked good and I enjoyed the first opus.\n\nHowever, there is a scripting error at one moment. And despite posts on the forum, nothing was ever done for the Steam version.\n\nHow can I review completely a game I can't even finish? How can I tell you that it was a good game?\n\nUnless the devs updated it, I'm forced to leave this short review and to ask you to avoid buying this.\n\nEDIT: According a post from a dev, a patch is available. You have to contact them. I will not do it, because I would prefer an update pushed through the Steam update system. I suppose that this is due to a change of publisher or something like that and that they don't have access to the page.","September 16, 2015","false","1.1"," 14 of 14 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","14","14","0","0"

The graphics are much better (although Mina's avatar looks extremely creepy), the puzzles are much more varied and interesting than before. The voice acting is still among the worst I've ever heard. All in all worth getting, if you're looking for a casual puzzle adventure.","March 16, 2014","true","5.6"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","13","15","0","0"

You head to his house to find out more. There's no hand holding in this sequel; you either know who everyone is or you don't. I can't decided if this is a pro or a con because on one hand - no long explanations of things I already know, but on the other, it's been a while since I played the last game and could have used the refresher course.\n\nFrom what I was able to play, it's not bad. The voice acting is shoddy (but most hidden object games are) and the dialogue doesn't really match up, but that's the norm in these types of games. Everything I've played through seems like standard hidden object game material.\n\nHere comes the bad part. When I finally get to the first warp area, things are going smoothly, I'm crusing along and when I go to open the magic garden gate . . . it won't load. In fact, it gives me an error about how it's missing a chunk of data and asks if I want to continue or quit. I continue, but I can't do anything else. So I quit. Then I delete and reinstall. Start a new profile and reach the same area again. Moment of truth. Same thing happens again.\n\nDon't know how wide spread this issue is, but it's something to consider before purchasing.\n\nLink is to a screenshot of the issue.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=492185659","August 1, 2015","false","1.3"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Cateia Games has been delivering puzzle games for since 2007 and perhaps they should consider reaching for a more advanced audience who take puzzle adventures more seriously.

I uninstalled it then reinstalled it and it did the same thing. I like the first one and the begining of this one was good too. I just can't understand why it is saying (error missing data) quit or continue. If you say continue you get a black screen and you can't get out of it . then you have to go to task managerment to end task . Please I hope the fix this issue I like to get back playing it.","February 22","false","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
