This review is based on the experience I had playing with an XB360 controller and a SFIV Tournament Edition Arcade Fightstick.\n\nDungeons & Dragons: Chronicles of Mystara is actually two games in one. Both are excellent remakes of the old arcade games D&D: Tower of Doom (1993) and D&D: Shadow over Mystara (1996). The story of the games overlap - Shadow over Mystara begins shortly after the end of Tower of Doom's campaign - but they can be played in any order. The game has you (and up to three of your friends) play as a noble team of adventurers on a grand adventure through the land of Mystara, a classic fantasy realm populated by elves, goblins, kobolds and fearsome dragons.\n\nPROS:\n- One of the best options out there for anyone that enjoys oldschool brawlers/beat 'em ups.\n- Very faithful port, and runs well. Spectacular visuals that hold up even today.\n- Several different display options; scanlines, different views, etc. Including a view of the entire "cabinet."\n- Online and couch co-op for up to four players, drop in and out at any time.\n- Visual design is great, and soundtrack does a good job of immersing you in the game.\n- Stays true to the original D&D feeling; the game features spell slots as well as loot in the form of new armour and equipment for your character.\n- Limited character customisation and progression: Choose from classic D&D staples like Elf, Thief, Fighter, Cleric, and Magic User. Gain levels and grow stronger as you journey on.\n- The second game (Shadow over Mystara) features a more complex spell and equipment system. There are many types of weapons and equipment to find that change the way you play and deal with enemies (e.g. shields that enable you to block attacks that would otherwise be unblockable).\n- Branching storylines (Do you rush to the defence of the castle yourself, or do you seek help from the soldiers in the city? etc), and many optional areas. Lots of secrets to find.\n- An unexpectedly deep combat system for an oldschool brawler. Each character feels very different, and you'll have no trouble finding one that suits you. There are double jumps, dodge rolls, dashes, shield blocks, aerial maneuvers, attack combos and more to find and experiment with.\n- Very clear and accessible menus. No troubles getting things up and running.\n- Lots of challenges to clear, such as defeating enemies or using certain spells and attacks.\n- Tons of extras to unlock, including houserules (e.g. higher gold gain, or no respawning).\n\nCONS:\n- These games were originally coin-op style arcade titles, where you insert more coins to get back into the game when you die. This means the game is designed to be lethal in order to hook the player. Until you get a good grasp of the mechanics, you will die. A lot. Capcom has opted to go with a more lenient approach in the remake, giving you infinite credits (there is a House Rule that lets you play on a single credit). Although this is a good thing for those that want to have a casual experience with friends, it also means that you can blaze through the entire game without stopping as you have infinite continues. This also means that there is no real reward for doing "well" (although there are difficulty levels that determine the HP and possibly amount of enemies).\n- Game is based on arcade stick controls and is best played with a controller. It's definitely possible to use the keyboard, but you might find it tedious.\n- Although online co-op usually runs very smooth, you might run into some issues if you are playing with three or more players and some of you are from different time zones. I experienced occasional slowdowns when running through Tower of Doom with American friends.\n- Certain enemies can be frustrating if you are playing alone, since groups of foes that can disable you (e.g. setting you on fire) can end up chain-stunning you for a long time if you are unlucky.\n- Aerial controls can sometimes be a bit clunky due to the way depth works in this game (It can be hard to determine if you can hit an enemy, or if they are too far away from you vertically).\n- Although this experience may be unique to me, I had one major issue: achivements bugging out. I played through the entire Tower of Doom game without unlocking a single achievement. Eventually I managed to fix it by verifying the game's cache, but the challenges were already unlocked in-game, which means I can no longer get these achievements. UPDATE: After contacting Capcom Support the problem was handily solved. I applaud their support staff for the swift reply.\n\nThe bottom line: should you buy this game?\nYES - Especially if you are a fan of oldschool brawlers, and/or you're looking for a fun co-op game to play with friends.","September 12, 2014","true","12.0"," 78 of 86 people (91%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","91","78","86","3","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/warskullx/recommended/229480/","warskullx","Warskull","http://steamcommunity.com/id/warskullx/","317 products in account","This is a port of two classic Capcom brawlers with a Dungeons and Dragons theme.  You get both the Tower of Doom and Shadow over Mystara.  Many consider these games to be the best brawlers of an era.  The game's implementation of GGPO means the online multiplayer is smooth.  It includes some bonus content (such as concept art), but the real meat of the game is still the two brawlers themselves.  They hold up fairly well after all these years and are still rather insteresting games.  However, the plethora of continues available remove some of the bite they originally had.  Brawlers easily became quarter eaters in the past and with enough coins you could always trudge them them.\n\nStill there is enough content left to warrant owning this game.  However, the asking price of $15 is somewhat steep.  This is a prime canditate to add to your wishlist and pick it up on Steam sale.  50% off or more is just the right price.  It is worth playing eventually, but not necessarily immediately.  It will also provide poor satisfaction for someone who only plays single player games.  Brawlers are at their best when played with a buddy.","November 27, 2013","true","3.6"," 31 of 35 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","31","35","0","1"

Sneak off and walk up to the mall to waste quarters on the arcade cabinets, all that jazz...\n\nAnd this just brought back tons of memories. All the quarters I dumped into this thing since I had no clue how D&D worked. That's the thing to remember going in.\n\nA side-scrolling brawler incorporating D&D mechanics, one would be surprised at the amount of knowledge they should have going in. If someone doesn't have a party when they're a magic user, they might wonder why they can't cast their spells against the Beholder boss. Or in Tower of Doom, they might wonder why certain monsters just won't stay down until they're burned or beaten to jelly.\n\nEven not having this knowledge however, these games are still fun. Replayability is definitely a factor, with dozens of items to collect as you go along. A radial item wheel is available to access the items or spells you collect, and even to switch equipment for classes that can do so, and while some people may claim the keyboard controls are clunky it's a minor hiccup in all honestly. Even going from WASD movement to arrow movement for this isn't the end of the world. The game isn't as pretty as one would expect from a packaged port like this. I personally haven't tinkered with options, but there are some glaring issues here and there with things that just pop out, at the least in Shadow of Mystara. The audio is just as I remember, excellent music for around the year these games came out and a reminder that before Squenix took over, Capcom was the go-to music company.\n\nConsidering you're picking up two games for the price of one, the TL;DR of this is yes. Chronicles of Mystara is worth it. Graphically, you get what the age and port would expect. Audibly, the game is ear-candy. Playability-wise, exceptional. It's not perfection, but it's damn close to it for the price.","May 10, 2015","true","3.3"," 29 of 32 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","29","32","0","0"

I used to play this game in the arcades when I was younger and this game still holds out today as far as quality gameplay goes. The only gripe I have about this game is that the special graphics filters really slow down the framerate of this game , I have to turn them off in order to play. I am not annoyed by this fact but since I obviously have over the minimum system requirements its strange.\n\nWhat I find cool is the emulation options. They have different views when it comes to emulating the machines. You can choose a mode with graphics surrounding it or you can choose dual monitors like the arcade.\n\nGlad Capcom took their time on this release. I hope to see more classic arcade games in the future.

Basically these games, for their time, and even now, do a fantastic job of capturing much of the Dungeons and Dragons formula.\n\nThat being said, these games run on the Advanced Dungeons and Dragons (AD&D) rules, so if you play a character who casts spells, don't expect to be able to blast away willy-nilly.  Spells a ultra-powerful abilities that are extremely limited in their use until the party makes camp for the night, and this only happens at set story moments in the game.

Even though this game is slightly old, it still has very good playablility. The game itself is set in Mystara which is a unknown/unique D&D world, or basically what is known as a Home Campaign. Anyway, enough of the basics, lets write out the pros and cons.\n\nPros-\n\nGraphics, the graphics are actually pretty good (for the time that is). The characters and things look cool, and have many different animations.\n\nCharacter Development, although there is a set number of characters you can play as, as to how you use them is totally up to you. Want to have a Dwarf tank while using only ranged weapons? You can do that (albeit unnatural). Plus your characters level up the more you use them, so playing the game through with a single character is ideal here.\n\nMusic/Audio, the music is really good, but the audio is really good. From the clang of weapon on shield to the hit of a spell on an enemy, it just sounds cool.\n\nCons-\n\nDifficulty, unless you play this game a lot, then you will likely think the difficulty to be overly hard. But you must remember that this was an arcade game, where they made it hard so you would have to dish money into them. If you get good at it, it actually isn't to hard, just keep at it.\n\nClass Balancing, although each class has its own unique things, the classes overall are not balanced. The mage by far is overpowered, with so many spells available to him and so many uses for such spells, you can basically walk through almost all the levels. But the real over powered character is the Warrior. If you get good at using him, he can basically defeat anything given enough time.\n\nMenu, using a keyboard is not recommended, it is just to inefficient to try to cycle through the menus while avoiding a Displacer Beast or Beholder.\n\nConclusion-\nOverall, it is still a very fun and challenging game. If you like old style arcade games and hack and slash games, then this is a must. If you like anything Dungeons&Dragons, then you may be interested in the story, much like myself. Anyway, hope this review has helped at least a little bit.\n\nMay your adventures be many and always end in reward!\n-Donoknight, Founder of Tabletop RPG Gamers League","July 21, 2015","true","4.8"," 17 of 19 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","17","19","0","0"

Even today.\n\nThe graphics aren't high definition, but still sharp enough and are definitely an improvement over the original graphics, thanks to our high resolution monitors.\n\nLike the original games; the gameplay is all about beating creatures up, while collecting money, gear and finding secrets. Basically a beat 'em up with light RPG elements. You can pick one of the many available classes. All of them come with their own armor and moves. A nice and great idea back then, but when you compare it to (action) RPGs of today it's, obviously, disappointing. Especially when you can customize pretty much anything these days, from the looks of your character to your own playstyle by selecting the specific skills *you* want to use. I agree it's an unfair comparison, but I couldn't help but notice it, because the game is linear and short, and the current asking price is steep for what you actually get. There are so many other games out there, for the same price, or even lower, that give you much, much more value for your money.\n\nAnyway, the developers have also added challenges to the games. Kill 10 enemies for example and you'll earn in-game currency that you can spend in the virtual store to buy artwork and magazine pages, as well as things that can help you beat the game like making your items unbreakable. It's a fun idea that I'd love to see appear in other 'modern retro' games. It does give the game some replay value.\n\nAs I mentioned the game is short. This is thanks to the unlimited continues. There's no penalty for dying. So beating these games in approximately 2 hours, well, that's pretty fast. And the other available classes aren't all that different to warrant a second playthrough, but I guess you could give the drop-in/drop-out co-op a try though. Or I could see you play it again to complete some more of the challenges.\n\nTo make a long story short; buy it if it's cheap (because it is a fun game), but for the current asking price (€15) it's just not worth it.\n\n[Rating: 75/100]","June 22, 2013","true","2.7"," 16 of 18 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","16","18","0","1"

You also have options for better resolutions, vsynch, and even options for playing the game from an arcade cabinet, though that makes the screen much smaller and harder to play.  It's better to play in widescreen or standard with achievement bars on the sides.\n\nSound:\nAll the sound is just how it was back in the day, perfectly ported to this version.  And the music is just as great as it was back then, too!  No complaints!\n\nControl:\nIt's a bit different than using the old arcade stick, but it's quick to get use to a controller for it.  I have NOT tried keyboard/mouse and for a game like this, it is probably best that you don't.  Gamepad gives you quick access to your skills and secondary weapons and makes it easy to use them.  So yes, gamepad.\n\nGameplay:\nJUST how it was.  Secondary weapons, spells, able to change weapons.  There is NOTHING missing from this game (that I can tell).

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/goldenagegmr/recommended/229480/","goldenagegmr","GAGMR","http://steamcommunity.com/id/goldenagegmr/","425 products in account","A surprisingly good Beat-Em-Up RPG-like game where you gain levels & upgrades as you fight your way through the game with added features that make it unique compared to it's arcade original.\n\nPROS\n-Up to 4 player Online/Offline Co-Op\n-Easy Multiplayer where people can jump in/out of games easily\n-Several different Characters to play\n-Fun Classic Arcade Beat-em'up Style\n-2 Games in One\n\nCONS\n-Repetitive Game Play\n-Lack of D-Input Support (Joy2Key Needed)\n\nFEATURES\n\nThe game has two games to choose from.  TOWER OF DOOM & SHADOW OF MYSTARA.  Shadow of Mystara is the game's main campaign with more game play elements & characters to play as while Tower of Doom is the 2nd campaign which is basically an older version of the 1st campaign with slightly less features.\n\nBoth campaigns are very similar with the exception of graphical differences.  In SoM each character has special abilities unique to them which gives them a unique play style.  The Rogue can Double Jump & Throw Rocks with her sling, the Warrior can Block attacks with his shield & so on.  ToD doesn't have these features for each character.\n\nYou can also swap your special ability for an item that you have in your inventory & is easily switched by simply pressing a button then rotating to the item you want.  It can be cumbersome to do so in the middle of a fight since you can't move/attack while doing it.  The same cycle mechanic is used in both campaigns for items.\n\nAt the end of each level you fight a boss & after the boss you enter a shop menu which lets you buy health potions to heal & weapons that your character can wield. There are also branching paths in each campaign near the end of each chapter.  If you are playing a co-op match you choose by majority vote.  If the vote is 50/50 I think it's random.\n\nYou also gain level ups after each mission. These feel pretty much tacked on but they do serve a purpose.  The Fighter gets a stronger sword, the Mage gets more spells, & every class gets more HP every level.  If you die you can swap characters mid play through but they start out at the lowest level so it's better to stick with the same character as you play.\n\nThe Final Boss in SoM is probably one of the most hilarious things I've seen in an arcade game.  It's not how she looks but how she fights.  She's just a super killing machine meant to eat quarters & even has a giant instant kill AOE attack that you can't dodge & takes up the entire screen.  Luckily, you have infinite continues so you don't have to worry about that nonsense.\n\nThe game also has "House Rules" which let you customize each play through with different game play elements.  These can make the game easier or much harder depending on what you choose.  This adds much more replay value as there are a lot of different settings to choose from.  You do need to unlock most of these by completing achievements, though.  There's a convenient achievement tracker while you play the game as well.\n\nOVERALL\n\nOverall the game is fun, enjoyable, has a lot of content added compared to the originals & is very well done for an arcade port.  The online co-op is simple & easy to use.  You make a room, & can either wait for people to join or start playing & have them join mid game or join another game in progress.  The Single-Player is also enjoyable but the real fun is in the co-op.\n\nI recommend buying it if you like Classic Arcade Games or just want a good gaming experience.","May 14, 2015","true","4.5"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","2"

The first game, Tower Of Doom, is a fairly straight forward beat'em up with the addition of having an inventory of limited spells/items you may use in combat. Shadow Over Mystara on the other hand is alot more advanced, the inventory/spell system is expanded upon, equipment upgrades you can obtain, along with more techniques+combos you can perform with your character.\n\nGraphically, both games look really good, especially Shadow Over Mystara which looks more more refined and alot more vibrant. Both games in terms of audio sound really good, the voice acting is great (hilarious), especially the Cleric and his STICKS TO SNAKES, and the sound effect using for Striking in Tower Of Doom which I swear is lifted directly from Mega Man X's Buster Charge. Honestly I like Tower Of Doom's soundtrack more, some areas have somewhat Castlevaniaish music to them that I like.\n\nBoth games are alot of fun, but I think Shadow Of Mystara gets more love due to it's refined and more technical gameplay mechanics, along with having more routes and treasures to find. Overall, I'd highly recommend this game to fans of the beat'em up genre. Capcom did great things back in the 90's in arcades.\n\nOne last thing worth mentioning is this game uses GGPO for netplay, so the game is very playable online, unlike other beat'em ups such as Double Dragon Neon. So you can totally get a group of 4 going and have a good time!","February 1","true","4.4"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

I absolutely love the fact that they've reworked the original game quite a bit and even added Online Coop feature. You can host or look for games, join others drop-in style or from the beginning if you like. Lag can be a bit of a problem but they've also added a ping limiter apparently so you can filter out the people outside your area and whatnot.\n\nControls can be a bit messy until you get used to it, it takes a while to get used to even for a beat em up game. Another thing that bugged me was how they left the magic as it was, it looks fantastic when you're playing alone or in an arcade game place but not online when it pauses the game for everyone for about 3-4 seconds to watch the special effects, they'll have to sort it out asap.\n\nThe game itself seemed a bit sandbox-ish, at least for a 2D sidescrolling game, there's quite a bit of exploration and looting, and you can do certain combo moves as you attack, not to mention you do all these with 3 other actual players. The inventory is stacked and divided to 2-3 parts, you can choose to use magic or throwing weapons or simply potions and various items instead. When you die, you can just respawn right away at the cost of your "score".\n\nIt's definitely worth a look if you've got friends to play with and definitely worth the price if you ask me.","June 29, 2013","true","4.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

If you ever wondered what an arcade version of Diablo might feel like, the two games contained in this package have all the answers for you.\n\nRivalling proper homeconsole games from "back then" in terms of replayability, secrets and items and combining  FinalFight/StreetFighter-esque battles with a hint of roleplaying and the very strong Dungeons & Dragons license makes for an incredible arcade-romp that still holds up today. Both games aren't without flaws, though and depending on your willingness to accept that these games are roughly 20 years old you might find them to be somewhat lacking in comfort or in catering to a computer-audience. A Microsoft controller or even better a proper Arcadestick are highly recommended for getting the most out of this.\n\nThe actual conversion to modern OS' is a bit of a mixed bag unfortunately, the filters are downright useless and the scaling does a poor job of maintaining the correct pixel aspect ratio. Cutting AttractMode and Intro from the games is a downright ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ choice and very weird (older "for matching service"-titles by CAPCOM offered these in a seperate menu for your viewing pleasure). And talking about poor decisions; allowing me to unlock artwork is great, however - I'd prefer you give me the (incredibly awesome) artwork related to the games and not some MonsterManual ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t from D&D 3.5 (which isn't even looking like the stuff in the game, cause the game is based on a older edition (Advanced Dungeons & Dragons by TSR)).\n\nOh, and basically the majority of the "HD" stuff they tacked on looks incredibly crappy. Why exactly did we need ♥♥♥♥♥♥ renders in the Item collection? Still, being able to coop-online on one of the greatest 4-player arcade machines with no shady MAME-business going on and for everyone to enjoy is much appreciated by me. So getting this is a no-brainer, really.\n\nHopefully this marks the beginning of more great titles from CAPCOMs glorious arcade legacy hitting Steam!","June 23, 2013","true","20.5"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Stuff not seen in other's of it's kind is the aspect of 'leveling up', your EXP being your points, while also collecting gold to replenish weapons and health doing intermissions. Not only that, but you also get a ton of expendables you can carry and use when you wish, more less depending on your class, a multatude of spells and combat actions to assist you getting from start to finish.\n\nTower of Doom sadly shows it's age greatly nowdays, with it's somewhat 'stiff' inputs and movement, more less a few bosses that are clearly there to grind down your credits, yet does have a lot of little touches, such as being able to destory arrows before they hit you, and even a puzzle boss or two. Shadow over Mystara thought is the real meat of this product, with fast flowing combat, tons of spells and actions to make use of and gain as you level up, lots of hidden paths and weapons, being able to collect monster parts to craft into equipment, more less the only Beat-em up where you can equip a different main weapon outside of Cyber Warriors. Rings, Cloak, helment and armor, boots man and offhand all make up your charater's equipment list, really feeling like this is an action based table top adventure.\n\nOverall, if you enjoy beat-em up's, this one's a no brainer. It will last you for quite some time, and with GGPO online support, you can always pull a friend over for online Co-Op to boot. If I had any gripes, the extras you can unlock by doing the 'achivements' are more fitting of D&D 3.5 and 4.0, then the AD&D this game was based off of, so they feel horrably out of place and not really fitting of any of the content you will activly be playing.","March 19, 2014","true","13.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Harley365/recommended/229480/","Harley365","Harley365","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Harley365/","212 products in account","\nThe pair of games in Capcom's Dungeons & Dragons: Chronicles of Mystara collection may very well be the best of its beat-'em-up games from the '90s arcade era, and these ports from Iron Galaxy are the most robust versions of the duo of Tower of Doom and Shadow Over Mystara to date. The 1999 Sega Saturn ports were exclusive to Japan and were unfortunately downgraded from four-player to two-player co-op, but these new HD ports are upscaled versions of the four-player arcade originals with a few modern additions, such as visual filters, unlockable rules, and concept art. Of course, the real draw is the co-op beat-'em-up experience, which has stood the test of time surprisingly well. It's a return to form for these nearly 20-year-old games; for players who remember them, and even those who don't, Chronicles is worth the time it takes to wrangle a party of warriors and suit up for battle.\n\nComing toward the end of Capcom's stint in side-scrolling brawlers, these games are far more advanced than was typical of the genre at the time, when their contemporaries included only temporarily equippable secondary weapons and a small selection of combo attacks and special moves. Capcom took a more role-playing-game-like approach by including elements of level progression, optional equipment, and supply shops. There are branching paths and conditional events, and even the name you give your character determines certain factors of your character's skill and equipment loadout. These nuances, especially in Shadow Over Mystara, with its advanced Street Fighter-like inputs, provide plenty of depth. There are moments when fighting common enemies becomes repetitive, but it's not difficult to find new ways to play to keep the experience fresh; it's often as easy as choosing a different character and exploring their distinct moveset.\n\nYou and your co-op cohorts have four character classes to choose from in Tower of Doom: fighter, elf, cleric, and dwarf. Shadow Over Mystara contains those four and adds the thief and magic-user classes to the roster. The classes differ quite noticeably in speed, power, and abilities, and though you can charge your way through the game with any selection thanks to unlimited continues, it's a far more rewarding experience to plan and build a team of complementary characters. The availability of unlimited continues is good in the sense that it lets you see everything the game has to offer, but it ultimately cheapens the thrill of victory.\n\nTypical thief. Picking up loot while everyone else does the dirty work.\n\nBoth Tower of Doom and Shadow Over Mystara were designed for co-op play, and though playing solo can be enjoyable, it pales in comparison to the fun that can be had when joining up with a team. Without expert knowledge of the nuanced controls, such as the proper timing of a riposte with the cleric, it's not uncommon to die quite frequently when fighting monsters on your own. Each class's default abilities are detailed in the main menu, but it will take considerable practice to memorize, and consistently perform, some advanced but crucial maneuvers, a task that's more easily done when someone has got your back.\n\nHealth pickups are few and far between, but again, the unlimited-continues system negates their worth. Don't bother spending money on health in shops between levels (unless you're chasing a high score); you're fully revitalized the next time you continue after death. It's the nature of a direct arcade port that doesn't include a coin limit. The unlockable Elimination mode does away with the default continue system--entirely. Once it's enabled, you die the first time your HP runs out. This is good for those trying to prove their mastery, but it doesn't really resolve the hand-holding nature of the default system in a desirable fashion.\n\nAnd people wonder why dragons get such a bad rap.\n\nOf course, judging classic games by modern standards is tricky. Ultimately, it comes down to expectations. Tower of Doom and Shadow Over Mystara were revered upon release, but their classic traits can be off-putting without a nostalgic perspective to give them context. Players who have graduated from the past and are looking for a more advanced experience may view this collection as a lighthearted diversion. However, for anyone who has waited the better part of two decades to play these games, their arrival on modern platforms is nothing short of awesome. Dungeons & Dragons: Chronicles of Mystara is a great port of two delightful games, and unsurprisingly, they're the very best versions that you can get your hands on.\n\nThe Good\nTwo sought after arcade games in one package.\nThe classic gameplay holds up better than that of their contemporaries.\nRPG elements add necessary depth to the beat-'em-up formula.\n\nThe Bad\nUnlimited continues sully the joy of victory.\nToo few enemy types.\n\n7/10\nGood\n","May 17","true","8.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

A wide range of character choices and story outcome based on the time it was made this game was and will always be one of my favorites.  The best part is, you get two games in one with it.  It's easy to join others or start your own session as well if you want to play multiplayer.  I ended up buying me a copy then going and buying not 3 but 4 of my friends one as well so we all can play together or they can have as much fun as I do with it.

So maybe the co-op will be better.\n\nBut my impressions of the game from what I saw.\n\nI like the levels and how you can choose your fate of where you go between some levels.\n\nThe combat knocks a point off because though it is simple. Sometimes the evade slide or even your lunge attack(down, forward, attack) won't work, or the enemy hitbox will be out of range somehow despite your weapon going through their body, and you just get beat on.\nI had a boss stand still, I kept swinging, every swing missed. Then suddenly I hit him a few times and kept missing again.\n\nA boss (some kind of frost serpent) went down on the map, where I couldn't move to so I missed every attack but he could hit me fine. I like the combat on normal enemies. But when the boss fights happen it feels like the game breaks.\n\nI like the fact you can change characters any time after you die. So if you don't like a certain character you can change before respawning.\nSpeaking of respawning, there is unlimited lives. So can make plenty of mistakes and not have to restart.\n\nIf you put time into it, many people can seem to beat it fine on 1 life.\nI don't see me playing enough to get that good.\n\nI got this full price, but I recommend it at a sale price to be sure. Especially if you don't have friends to play it with and stuck at solo only.","May 4","true","4.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

While the game is good, it's the very definition of arcade ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.  Even if you get really good at the game, there is quite a number of '♥♥♥♥ you' walls in place to make sure you never get too powerful.  For example, in the Tower of Doom's final stage, you fight the Shadow Elf again and he's just there to murder the hell out of you before the final boss.  And this is because, upon death, you lose ALL upgrade items in Tower of Doom.  And, prior to the fight, you can get a Ring of Protection +2, Boots of Speed, and magical weapons.  He is just there to take your items away so the final boss is a pain in the ♥♥♥.  I once, with a group, got to the final boss with my stuff and he becomes a complete joke when fully upgraded.\n\nShadow Over Mystara, the second game in the bundle, is far more fair.  It feels like there's actual challenge there and not cheapness like in Tower of Doom.  Also, the additional classes in Shadow are great.  If I need to recommend this game for something, let it be for Shadow Over Mystara.  Although, both games are great when playing with friends, I can only recommend the second one for the solo player.","June 22, 2014","true","25.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The attack button is the "pick up item" button, and you cannot what you want to do, so when one of the thousands of goblins drops a single gold piece in front of the dark elf you're supposed to kill, you pick up the penny instead of defend yourself from the stone cold killer. The move controls are the arrow keys instead of wasd, you know, like every other pc game ever. The space bar is the pause button instead of the jump button, so when i panicked, which happened 9/10 of the time while playing this game, i would bring the game to a screeching halt instead of dodging the attack, remainding me that i could quit at any time.

I have never actually played Tower of Doom so this review only concerns Shadows over Mystara.\n\nAs the game was  made by Capcom they tend to have a bit more to interest to them then the typical button masher types.  Characters have special moves unique to them made with fighting-game inputs, and each class has fairly unique features about them that make playing each fun.  The game is about an hour or less per full run through, and with infinite credits you do not have to worry about a lost playthrough or it being too hard.  The game is not without its faults, some of the secrets are extremely obscure and the inventory system often is more trouble than it is worth.  There is not much replayability but it would probably be a pretty great pick-up-and-play game for lan parties or hangouts.\n\nThe ports are faithful and completely functional, and contain some extra content like mode variants and concept arts.  The real draw here is that the game has netplay that works VERY WELL alongside local multiplayer.  Capcom really went out of their way to satisfy fans by making the game functional, which is something I appreciate.  You will not likely find a functional cabinet of this game nowadays.  Its certainly an old game, but its pretty good for the era.

In total there's 100 items across 2 seperate games! Mix that with new "House Rules" and local/online drop-in/drop-out multiplayer for up to 4 players and you've got a game that's worth the $15 in my eyes.\n\nThe combat system is pretty basic, but each of the 6 characters are indeed in-depth enough to make things interesting. Unless you're the Magic-User, combo potential is pretty good for beating down your opponents. The Magic-User can also combo, but not to the same degree of depth. Spells make up for this though, and BOY does he have a lot of them.\n\nUnsurprisingly, this game has a Level-Up system. The Score you gain from grabbing items and killing enemies are the Experience Points you gain for leveling-up, which increases your Health and makes you more powerful to some degree. I mean, it's Dungeons & Dragons, so it's kind of expected, even if it doesn't make too much sense for a Beat-Em-Up.\n\nThe game is kind of unforgiving in terms of difficulty, so expect to die a lot. I got game over 30+ times during my 1st and 2nd playthrough of Shadow over Mystara. I haven't tried online play yet, but I hope to if my friends pick the game up. Maybe more players will make it easier, although I doubt it. This still won't deter me from playing it!\n\nAll I can say is, if you're a fan of old-school Arcade Beat-Em-Ups, you'd be missing out on a gem if you've never played this.","November 28, 2013","true","2.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It was absolutely one of my favorites.\n\nThis game does NOT have full controller support.  It does work with my XBox 360 controller, but not my USB controller.  Very disappointing.  (I like the fit and feel of my USB controller better.)\n\nHaving said that...  the game is...  well, the game.  It's what you played in the arcade and possibly on your emulator.  The game even seems to be complete with the fraction of a second delay response to the button inputs that came with the arcade game back in the 90s.  The game is fun enough but, like all side scrolling beat-'em-ups...  you have to deal with the boss characters that are invulnerable for a time that are designed to mop the floor with you.  Standard fare.\n\nDon't pay full price for this.  And honestly, don't even pay half price for it unless you're a HUGE fan of the game and absolutely dying to get it.\n\n(I have yet to try the online feature of the game...  and I'm sure eventually I will, just for giggles...  but that wasn't the reason I got the game.)","September 15, 2014","false","0.6"," 15 of 33 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","15","33","0","6"

Nostalgia is what will make you buy them, and nostalgia will maybe let you play twice as long as you would if they were "new" games.\n\nSkill as an element in this game makes up about 20% of your survival chances, but there are SO MANY cheap deaths and gameplay is so poor that rage quitting is basically the only thing that will prevent you from getting through the hour or so long campaign.\n\nI only played SP, but maybe this game is less cheap or more fun in MP, but really, especially some of the boss fights have so many cheap, unblockable, undodgeable attacks that even if you know all of the attacks coming, you'll still get into endless loops of getting hit until you're dead and have to continue again.\n\nI don't understand how people are saying this is the best beat-em-up of that era, as Final Fight, while having some cheap elements, was still beatable without continuing even if you made a couple mistakes. In this one, certain enemy attacks, falling fireballs, etc happen much faster than certain character animations, so if you're in the middle of swinging a sword and an enemy pops up and throws a fireball at you, there is absolutely nothing you can do. And it happens constantly.\n\nOnly buy it for nostalgia reasons or if you really think the MP will be worth it.","March 26, 2014","false","2.7"," 11 of 25 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","11","25","0","0"

I can certainly appreciate the marriage of RPG and beat-em-up elements that Capcom's Dungeons & Dragons arcade games offered, especially given that it was innovative at the time (and still sort of is). I can also readily understand loving the games' aesthetics, because the graphics and art direction still hold up well. However, like every beat-em-up of its era, these games had nothing to do with skill and everything to do with how many quarters you were willing to part with. Clunky movement and horrendously imbalanced damage ensured that you would lose repeatedly, and the fact that this rerelease allows you infinite credits is telling of just how much of a massive scam these games were. What's more, if you're buying this version, you're paying for some "features" that make some pretty bad games even worse. Playing on an emulator that supports Netplay is not only cheaper, but it will also rid you of the terrible bezel that takes up damn near the entire screen, in addition to allowing you the opportunity to find far more people to play with.","December 5, 2013","false","2.7"," 3 of 14 people (21%) found this review helpful","21","3","14","0","2"

Throw in 4 player co-op, house rules you can implement to alter how the game is played, tons of extra content, and a number of branching paths in game, as well as challenges to complete and you have a game that will take ages to get old.  3 playthroughs and I'm still having a blast playing through it.

If you ever played it in the arcade there were never enough quarters in the world to get you through.  Now that is no longer a problem and with full online co-op support with drop in and drop out you can play with your friends  from anywhere without having to both be sitting in front of the same screen.  Oustanding port by Capcom that does not lose anything from the original.\n\nMy only complaint (and maybe I just have not figured out how to adjust this yet) is the sounds of the actual heroes in the game.  They are EXTREMELY quiet compared to the arcade cabinet.  In the arcade me and my friends would always be parroting their ridiculous quotes like the infamous "LIGHTNING BOLT" as the characters say whatever spell they are casting out loud.  That was a huge part of the fun of this game was the extremely silly voice acting of the characters shouting out the names of spells as they were casting them.  It is very hard to hear them over the battle sound effects that are going on as you are almost always in large fights in the game.\n\nFor $14.99 its a steal- as it includes both of the full arcade games.  If you can get it on sale (I nailed it for the $7.99) it is a stupidly good deal for the play through value you will get.\n\nDO NOT buy this game for single player as it just feels extremely lonely and wrong to try and play it by yourself with a single hero.

Oustanding port by Capcom that does not lose anything from the original.\n\nMy only complaint (and maybe I just have not figured out how to adjust this yet) is the sounds of the actual heroes in the game.  They are EXTREMELY quiet compared to the arcade cabinet.  In the arcade me and my friends would always be parroting their ridiculous quotes like the infamous "LIGHTNING BOLT" as the characters say whatever spell they are casting out loud.  That was a huge part of the fun of this game was the extremely silly voice acting of the characters shouting out the names of spells as they were casting them.  It is very hard to hear them over the battle sound effects that are going on as you are almost always in large fights in the game.\n\nFor $14.99 its a steal- as it includes both of the full arcade games.  If you can get it on sale (I nailed it for the $7.99) it is a stupidly good deal for the play through value you will get.\n\nDO NOT buy this game for single player as it just feels extremely lonely and wrong to try and play it by yourself with a single hero.  You need at least 2+ people to truly enjoy this arcade masterpiece.","September 13, 2014","true","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Very nicely done. This is not for people who like fluid, highly-responsive action combat, as the controls are (intentionally) period-specific to a frustrating extent. Great for small get-togethers, as it supports up to 4 players who can drop in and out freely. Definitely has something to offer beyond the nostalgia value, but likely not for $15.

For a beat em up you have tons of variety in spells, items, classes and different paths you can take on, adding lots of replayability. It should be noted, that some people have some crashing experiences in the main menu, but I haven't heard anyone dropping from the game yet, so all things considered, it gets a pass in my book.\n\nMultiplayer is for up to 4 players and there is 6 classes to choose from: Fighter, dwarf, elf, cleric, thief and magic user. They have some of the basic things in common, like basic combo and slide, but there is major differences in how they actually play. For example, dwarf has a lots of tankiness but is somewhat slow, while thief is weaker but can backstab, double jump and steal items.\n\nGame rewards people for teamwork, and a right team saves of a lot of continues, since every class is tailored for something: Fighter, dwarf and thief are good for killing standard mobs, while cleric has a heal and stat boosting abilities, lastly Magic user and elf are useful for killing bosses. This doesn't mean you can't solo the game with any class without dying once if you have played it enough and know it's gimmicks.\n\nAt the moment of this recommendation, there is a a few players in online, so you still have a chance to play this on multiplayer even if you can't get your friends to play this. This game is made in 1993, however, it has aged well since it was made for the arcade board. Just remember to change filters and resolution from the options first.\n\nFor a nitpick, I'd say it is a bit on the easy side, because you get unlimited credits by default. You can later change survival mode on, which causes everyone to have only one life, but it would've been better, if you could set the amount of credits yourself.\n\nWith it's good replayability, animation and presentation, this title was a classic of it's time and before Dragon's Crown comes out, it doesn't get better than this.","June 28, 2013","true","10.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

The price might be a deal-breaker for some, but if you ever see it on sale I wholly recommend it.  Every class has a unique feel and the branching paths and general pace of both games keeps things interesting for numerous playthroughs.  The Tower of Doom is the first of the two and feels somewhat limited in its controls, however the game does get easier once you get a feel for the momentum of your character.  While I do prefer Shadow of Mystara for its faster gameplay and smoother controls, I still suggest that you give the Tower of Doom a try.  Shadow of Mystara is the second game in the bundle and feels much smoother in controls.  Characters move more naturally and the inventory system is more complex without being cumbersome.\n\nOne thing of note is that the game seems to have trouble accepting any controller that isn't an official Xbox 360 controller.  That seems to be my luck, anyway.   If you can manage to get a game going with other people the game gets even better, but I suggest you check a guide to ensure that you can manage a proper setup for multiple players if you plan on using the local co-op function.","July 14, 2014","true","13.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And yes, some (alright, MANY) of the bosses are downright cheap ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.\n\nBut really, those are just common design features of coin-operated arcade games, deliberately built in to keep you feeding the machine and squeeze every last coin out of your pockets - and then make you come back for more! With this port we have unlimited free credits and a bunch of optional "house rules" to smooth the way, as well as the Internet to spoil us on every little secret, strategy and easter egg there is to know.\n\nWhat's not to love?","November 7, 2013","true","24.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Well after years of not getting ports in America, it came to Steam and I could share this experience with my friends and, one day, my son (Or any future kids as well).

The price might be a deal-breaker for some, but if you ever see it on sale I wholly recommend it.  Every class has a unique feel and the branching paths and general pace of both games keeps things interesting for numerous playthroughs.  The Tower of Doom is the first of the two and feels somewhat limited in its controls, however the game does get easier once you get a feel for the momentum of your character.  While I do prefer Shadow of Mystara for its faster gameplay and smoother controls, I still suggest that you give the Tower of Doom a try.  Shadow of Mystara is the second game in the bundle and feels much smoother in controls.  Characters move more naturally and the inventory system is more complex without being cumbersome.\n\nOne thing of note is that the game seems to have trouble accepting any controller that isn't an official Xbox 360 controller.  That seems to be my luck, anyway.   If you can manage to get a game going with other people the game gets even better, but I suggest you check a guide to ensure that you can manage a proper setup for multiple players if you plan on using the local co-op function.","July 14, 2014","true","13.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game itself is challenging and engrossing, just like it was back in the arcade years.\nratings are from 1-5\n\nGameplay: 5 - No complex formulas.  No intriquet combo systems.  Just pure basic hack-n-slash gameplay of the arcade straight to your steam account and onto your PC.  It's a great romp from start to finish and includes not just other characters, but difficulty settings to keep you coming back for more and pit you against more challenigng enemies.  Discover each character's abilities and level them up by yourself or with local and online co-op (finding people to play this online is a challenge, as not many people set up lobbies for this).\n\nSound: 5 - Nostalgia-city for most arcade-goers in the 90s.  The music and sounds are spot-on and have aged fairly well.  All the yelling, grunting, and character voices are all here.\n\nGraphics: 4.5 - The grapihcs get the job done with vibrant colors and great special effects.  Still, you may get bored looking at some of the same browns and greys, but each environment differs from the other in some way, making it not so bland.\n\nControl: 4.5 - The controls are flawless, but it does require learing which keys/buttons do what commands.  Still, with a 360 controller, it's nearly a walk in the park.  Using magic, items and having to select them can be a pain, especially in the heat of battle, but it still works and remember: this is an arcade port.\n\nOverall: 4.75 - Even solo, I find myself coming back and visiting Mysteria over and over again.  Though I only have 2 hours put into this game, I've been playing it since I got it a bit at a time.  I first finished the game with the cleric, and am currently working on the elf as of this writing.\n\nFor those wishing to take a trip down memory lane, it's well worth the price.  Those looking for an interesting 4-player beat-em-up and have a few local friends to play with, it's definitely worth it.  Fans of hack-n-slash games will also find some enjoyment and there are unlockable items only attainable by purchasing with in-game currency earned while playing.","October 7, 2015","true","5.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Co-op DnD beat-em-up, With multiple paths for replayability, Secondary weapons and levels. Including added achievements and unlockable concept art!\n\nDo you like Dungeons & Dragons? Are you a fan of the Rules Cyclopedia/DnD Basic? Do you want to see Sticks to Snakes come to life!? All in a four player co-op beat-em-up!?\n\nThen boy, are you in for a treat!\n\nDnD: Chronicles of Mystara is a great package of two all time beat-em-up classics: Tower of Doom and Shadow over Mystara which have been regarded as one of the best Beat-em-ups ever, now with online multiplayer!\n\nNow for people who have never played the originals, i will explain the basics of these two games\n\nBoth Tower of Doom and Shadow over Mystara are really good beat-em-ups, but what makes them differ from other games of the genre like Streets of Rage or Knights of the Round is the different paths, secrets, Leveling and items like Throwing daggers or Magic rings\n\nDuring some levels, you are given a choice. For example: In the first stage you are asked to either help a town or chase the monsters to their lair in the mountains. This gives the game a lot of replayability and makes the 1 hour completion time feel not as bad.\n\nI also mentioned secrets, which include all kinds of bonus equipment like the Ring of Damage Resistance +2 and getting all of them will not be easy as some of them are well hidden.\n\nThe first game, Tower of Doom has 4 classes to play as: Fighter, Cleric, Elf and Dwarf. Each of the characters levels up as you progress through the game, granting more HP and more spells to the classes who have magic.\n\nThe second game, Shadows over Mystara adds a lot of content over ToD like, two more classes: Thief and Magic-user\nBetter inventory, Additional combat moves, smoother controls, faster and better looking spell effects, etc.\n\nBoth games boast incredibly good music, like most Capcom games back then and also the graphics look really good and detailed considering their age.\n\nIf i had one complaint about these games, it would be the arcade difficulty designed to get as many quarters as possible, but thanks to the infinite quarters, anyone can play through these games.\n*edit also doesn't support any other controller besides Xbox 360 and PS4, but can be avoided by using x360ce\n\nThis game gets my recommendation, so get in there with friends and smack the living daylights out of everything that moves!","December 29, 2015","true","9.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Before all this here internet gaming got itself going, well, we actually had to get out of the house if we wanted to go and play with other people. Oftentimes they would be found out at the mall, as part of a bowling alley, or maybe you were lucky enough to live near something like a Showbiz Pizza (nowadays known as Chuck E. Cheese) or an Enchanted Castle. They used to have all kinds of games that never used to see a home release- shooters, driving games... but my favorite were the multiplayer beat-em-ups. The Simpsons and Ninja Turtle four-player cabinets were really fun, and who could forget that X-Men double-screen six-player game? If you could get six players going on that, it was the stuff of legends.\n\nOut of all of them, well... my favorite really wasn't any of those. This was about the time in my life where I was starting to spread my little nerd wings, and well... I spied a certain franchise on a few arcade cabinets- Dungeons and Dragons. Guess where multiple bucks worth of my tokens could be counted on to reliably end up when I went out to game? It was always a chore to choose which of the two to play- unless I just dropped twenty bucks on tokens and played through both games, one after the other with a meal break in between. Those were the days... until I moved away and couldn't play them for the longest time.\n\nMost of the arcades have closed down- but thanks to some wonderful people, well... these two games have been preserved and re-released on Steam, and to be honest, I couldn't be happier. So go grab your character sheets, dice bags and cheez doodles, today we're looking at Dungeons and Dragons: Chronicles of Mystara.\n\nConsisting of two games- Tower of Doom and Shadow Over Mystara, both of these games take place in the Mystara campaign setting. The premise, well, is very simple- you're one of an adventuring party in each game, choosing between four different classes in ToD- warrior, dwarf, cleric, and elf, with Shadows adding in a thief and a magic-user. You're tasked with finding out just what the heck is going onto cause a rise in monster attacks on villages, and from there, well... no, I'm not going to spoil it! Just play them in order- finish Tower before you play Shadows and you'll get the whole story!\n\nThe action of this game brings to mind someone dropping a D&D adventure and a Final Fight arcade board into a blender and hitting frappe- you'll work through a number of levels, knocking the heads of classic D&D monsters like goblins, kobolds, gnolls, owlbears and others as you battle through to find yourselves the culprits as just just what the blazes is going on- picking up massive piles of shiny treasure, powerful weapons and magical artifacts along the way, gaining experience as you bash in heads. You'll hit levels at certain points of XP, granting better health, power and special abilities. The money you collect even has a purpose- sometimes you'll hit a between-level shop and be able to refill disposable things like burning oil, hammers, daggers, arrows...\n\nOh, did I forget to mention that? Every character gets a number of ring menus full of stuff to use instead of their regular weapon- this is most important for your caster classes, because it's how you access your spells. Just tap the ring button, tap until you have the spell you desire (Spells go by level- you get a certain number of spells per level per life, and once you burn through them all, you better hope more scrolls drop out of chests or you're going to be out of luck and down to whacking stuff. For example, Fireball and Lightning Bolt are both third-level spells), and then select it and hit the action button to let that sucker fly. Just beware that certain spells just won't work on everything- Cloudkill doesn't affect skeletons, for example.\n\nA number of stages contain various routes or selections- you will sometimes be given a choice of routes to take, or you might be up against a time limit to kill something. You could also find secret treasures. All in all, they're both really solid beat-em-ups and worth plying over and over and over...\n\nThe best part of these games, however, was actually included- the multiplayer. Feel like risking your sanity with some random Steam gamers? Make a public game and wait for slots to be filled... or you could just get a bunch of your friends together and make a private game- and then invite friends directly from your Steam friends list. Easy, simple multiplayer- you can easily kill a late night with this game, and it's a blast to play because you can keep going as long as you want and then people can drop in and out. That fluid, that seamless. All the other players have to do is wait a few minutes.\n\nDownsides to these games... well... hmmm... They end? There haven't been sequels? The fantasy theme might turn some people off? Each fighter is limited to one of two looks and can't change gender?\n\nThe price point is fifteen bucks retail, but it might catch sales that could knock it to half or better. Even at fifteen, though, it's a good purchase, and completely worth it.\n\nYou can't go wrong with this one- just buy it, install it, and enjoy.\n\nTL;DR - This will let you slay your boredom for 14d6+10 fun damage. 9/10.","February 25","true","3.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I remember my first time playing tower of doom was at a hotel with my older brother playing co-op two player. That day we dropped just under 20$ in the struggle to beat the game unfornuatly we failed just short of the finale and to our dismay we were out of money..... Self loathing at ourselves for being lured into the epicness of the game and wasting our hard earned money we forgot it. That is until I discovered it on steam and with a sequel. So many memories came rushing back and then anger at the fact I could of waited a couple years and gotten two games for under 15$ instead of wasting under 20$ to play one (>.>). Never the less I am pleased with my purchase and hopefull I can once again play co-op with my bro.

The game itself is challenging and engrossing, just like it was back in the arcade years.\nratings are from 1-5\n\nGameplay: 5 - No complex formulas.  No intriquet combo systems.  Just pure basic hack-n-slash gameplay of the arcade straight to your steam account and onto your PC.  It's a great romp from start to finish and includes not just other characters, but difficulty settings to keep you coming back for more and pit you against more challenigng enemies.  Discover each character's abilities and level them up by yourself or with local and online co-op (finding people to play this online is a challenge, as not many people set up lobbies for this).\n\nSound: 5 - Nostalgia-city for most arcade-goers in the 90s.  The music and sounds are spot-on and have aged fairly well.  All the yelling, grunting, and character voices are all here.\n\nGraphics: 4.5 - The grapihcs get the job done with vibrant colors and great special effects.  Still, you may get bored looking at some of the same browns and greys, but each environment differs from the other in some way, making it not so bland.\n\nControl: 4.5 - The controls are flawless, but it does require learing which keys/buttons do what commands.  Still, with a 360 controller, it's nearly a walk in the park.  Using magic, items and having to select them can be a pain, especially in the heat of battle, but it still works and remember: this is an arcade port.\n\nOverall: 4.75 - Even solo, I find myself coming back and visiting Mysteria over and over again.  Though I only have 2 hours put into this game, I've been playing it since I got it a bit at a time.  I first finished the game with the cleric, and am currently working on the elf as of this writing.\n\nFor those wishing to take a trip down memory lane, it's well worth the price.  Those looking for an interesting 4-player beat-em-up and have a few local friends to play with, it's definitely worth it.  Fans of hack-n-slash games will also find some enjoyment and there are unlockable items only attainable by purchasing with in-game currency earned while playing.","October 7, 2015","true","5.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Before all this here internet gaming got itself going, well, we actually had to get out of the house if we wanted to go and play with other people. Oftentimes they would be found out at the mall, as part of a bowling alley, or maybe you were lucky enough to live near something like a Showbiz Pizza (nowadays known as Chuck E. Cheese) or an Enchanted Castle. They used to have all kinds of games that never used to see a home release- shooters, driving games... but my favorite were the multiplayer beat-em-ups. The Simpsons and Ninja Turtle four-player cabinets were really fun, and who could forget that X-Men double-screen six-player game? If you could get six players going on that, it was the stuff of legends.\n\nOut of all of them, well... my favorite really wasn't any of those. This was about the time in my life where I was starting to spread my little nerd wings, and well... I spied a certain franchise on a few arcade cabinets- Dungeons and Dragons. Guess where multiple bucks worth of my tokens could be counted on to reliably end up when I went out to game? It was always a chore to choose which of the two to play- unless I just dropped twenty bucks on tokens and played through both games, one after the other with a meal break in between. Those were the days... until I moved away and couldn't play them for the longest time.\n\nMost of the arcades have closed down- but thanks to some wonderful people, well... these two games have been preserved and re-released on Steam, and to be honest, I couldn't be happier. So go grab your character sheets, dice bags and cheez doodles, today we're looking at Dungeons and Dragons: Chronicles of Mystara.\n\nConsisting of two games- Tower of Doom and Shadow Over Mystara, both of these games take place in the Mystara campaign setting. The premise, well, is very simple- you're one of an adventuring party in each game, choosing between four different classes in ToD- warrior, dwarf, cleric, and elf, with Shadows adding in a thief and a magic-user. You're tasked with finding out just what the heck is going onto cause a rise in monster attacks on villages, and from there, well... no, I'm not going to spoil it! Just play them in order- finish Tower before you play Shadows and you'll get the whole story!\n\nThe action of this game brings to mind someone dropping a D&D adventure and a Final Fight arcade board into a blender and hitting frappe- you'll work through a number of levels, knocking the heads of classic D&D monsters like goblins, kobolds, gnolls, owlbears and others as you battle through to find yourselves the culprits as just just what the blazes is going on- picking up massive piles of shiny treasure, powerful weapons and magical artifacts along the way, gaining experience as you bash in heads. You'll hit levels at certain points of XP, granting better health, power and special abilities. The money you collect even has a purpose- sometimes you'll hit a between-level shop and be able to refill disposable things like burning oil, hammers, daggers, arrows...\n\nOh, did I forget to mention that? Every character gets a number of ring menus full of stuff to use instead of their regular weapon- this is most important for your caster classes, because it's how you access your spells. Just tap the ring button, tap until you have the spell you desire (Spells go by level- you get a certain number of spells per level per life, and once you burn through them all, you better hope more scrolls drop out of chests or you're going to be out of luck and down to whacking stuff. For example, Fireball and Lightning Bolt are both third-level spells), and then select it and hit the action button to let that sucker fly. Just beware that certain spells just won't work on everything- Cloudkill doesn't affect skeletons, for example.\n\nA number of stages contain various routes or selections- you will sometimes be given a choice of routes to take, or you might be up against a time limit to kill something. You could also find secret treasures. All in all, they're both really solid beat-em-ups and worth plying over and over and over...\n\nThe best part of these games, however, was actually included- the multiplayer. Feel like risking your sanity with some random Steam gamers? Make a public game and wait for slots to be filled... or you could just get a bunch of your friends together and make a private game- and then invite friends directly from your Steam friends list. Easy, simple multiplayer- you can easily kill a late night with this game, and it's a blast to play because you can keep going as long as you want and then people can drop in and out. That fluid, that seamless. All the other players have to do is wait a few minutes.\n\nDownsides to these games... well... hmmm... They end? There haven't been sequels? The fantasy theme might turn some people off? Each fighter is limited to one of two looks and can't change gender?\n\nThe price point is fifteen bucks retail, but it might catch sales that could knock it to half or better. Even at fifteen, though, it's a good purchase, and completely worth it.\n\nYou can't go wrong with this one- just buy it, install it, and enjoy.\n\nTL;DR - This will let you slay your boredom for 14d6+10 fun damage. 9/10.","February 25","true","3.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However, it is much more diverse and complicated compared to other arcade games from it's time. The graphics are great, and they incorporate the usage of D&D rules well. They're games that stay fresh, offering different classes with different skills. While the game is very fun even when playing alone, it's always a blast when playing with other people, as the classes synergize better, and the feeling of kicking butt seems a whole lot better. All in all, these games are VERY hard, but can definitely be done in one go. Like actual D&D, you can choose between various paths throughout the games, which makes every single playthrough feeling fresh, making you eager to see what you could've done instead. Both games are very solid, but the sequel, Shadow over Mystara, is a big step up from the first game.

The main gimmick is that this is not only a solid beat 'em up, but one that's set in the Dungeons and Dragons universe, which means neat little features like access to a limited number of powerful spells that get recharged after a "rest", enemies that have mechanics like their tabletop counterparts (Undead, for instance, can't be hurt by any type of gas attack because they don't have lungs), and explorable environments with a few secret areas tucked here and there with bonus loot, and branching paths that, while not affecting the plot in any way, increase replayability in a MASSIVE way. With four to six playable classes, depending on whether you're playing Tower of Doom or Shadow over Mystara (the later of which has alternate variants of the Cleric and Magic User classes with different spells, bringing the effective total closer to 8), plenty of levels, and a rather ridiculous amount of loot to find, this is one beat 'em up with a LOT of meat on its bones. This port even comes with achievement milestones, adding even more to the pile. It's a fair amount of content for the asking price, especially on sale.\n\nUnfortunately, the playerbase is a bit small these days, so random matchmaking is a bit empty. This is definitely the type of game where buying a 4-pack to split with your friends is a solid investment.","March 1","true","22.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Its a good game, but I just really wish there was a limited life setting, yes I know I can just CHOOSE to stop continuing after a certain point, but I don't really trust myself or my friends to do that...","January 30","true","10.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
