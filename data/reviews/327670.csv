Battles are a balancing act - do I try for a quick finish attack, or go for endurance, gaining more experience but risking wasting resources on after-battle repairs?\n\nThe permadeath aspect is pretty well done - there are global unlocks which mean you'll take something away from even a crushing defeat; some of these are incremental (+15 starting health), and some have a larger effect by giving the option of choosing a different pilot (from a pleasingly PC selection), or Ironcast.   These different starting combinations  go a long way towards lessening any frustration around replaying early battles in every game.\n\nThe balancing act continues with the mission choices - Hard missions represent increased risk, but proffer tantalising additional rewards...but lose them and the game is over.\n\nIn short, the game offers me enough player agency to feel that my losses could have been avoided if I'd made better decisions.  And that's the essence of its "just one more turn/try" core.\n\nNot an epic game, but one I think I'll keep coming back to.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PeteOzzy/recommended/327670/","PeteOzzy","PeteOzzy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PeteOzzy/","4903 products in account","Matching games are a dime a dozen these days and the genre mash-ups have seen a meteoric surge thanks to the popularity of Puzzle Quest. If you've stumbled onto a mobile device's app store recently then chances are you've seen a dozen or so examples in just the last week. Even the supposed last bastion of "hardcore" gaming that is PC has been infiltrated by an impressive brigade of match 3s, chain-linkers and gem puzzlers. So with Ironcast adding to those numbers on Steam, should we really care?\n\nOh Hell yes.\n\nPuzzle Quest sparked imaginations due to its blending RPG features into a familiar formula. Ironcast does something similar by taking the core aspects of multitasking strategy titles like FTL and distilling them into components that suit a more casual, yet still complex model. You're not going to be making split-second decisions that decide the fate of the lives depending on you a la XCOM but that's not to say that the depth afforded by these elements isn't going to challenge you at every turn. Ironcast is more than tough, at times it can feel downright unfair. You're a one woman army with the odds against you from the very beginning and each encounter is finely tuned to make that apparent.\n\nYou are Aeres Powell, an Ironcast pilot fighting for the British Empire in an alternate Steampunk timeline where France has declared war and battles are fought with enormous mechanised monstrosities. The traditional stiff upper lip manner of speech and premise that France hasn't yet surrendered may suggest a comedic tone but the story is a well-written and convincing account of war-torn Victorian England. Those seeking lore to flavour the gameplay will find a moderately gritty tale that will make you care when you hear the consequences of a bad decision or mission failure.\n\nYou might think I've left discussing the gameplay this late due to its simplicity when the truth is that I'm unsure how to simplify it enough to fit this review. You can make three matches in a turn, collecting one of four different matters; ammo, coolant, energy and repair nodes. Each adds to a stockpile that can be used for a variety of actions that do not consume a turn. So far, so simple you might think. This is when the aforementioned strategy elements kick in. Each material can be used to power certain parts of your mech: your two weapons, your shields and your locomotive drives. Charging each system requires a combination of two resources so while you can potentially make an unlimited number of maneuvers in a turn, you'll quickly deplete your reserves leaving you entirely defenceless if you're reckless.\n\nWith that previous paragraph covering roughly a third of what you need to know to succeed, it's safe to say there's a wealth of tactics and knowledge to be gleaned from the competent tutorials and trials by fire. Balancing the demands of your mech with the need to manipulate the play-field is stressful enough without considering the advanced factors like evasion, over-heating, link nodes, overdrive and targeting specific body parts. On top of all of this, you have a total of twelve slots for augmentations and a wealth of equipment so customisation is key to winning the toughest missions. I've finished battles to find myself reclining into my seat physically exhausted, not realising how tense I'd become over the course of particularly tough battles. Becoming so involved and immersed is something I'd never thought possible in a game of this genre.\n\nIt is unrelentingly tough at times and you're not expected to be able to win first time round. Like Majora's Mask's looming moon, there's an enormous boss approaching headquarters that marks the deadline of each playthrough. All missions cost one day and with only 9 to spare you must choose the most rewarding path through the offerings. Certain missions will see you engaged in out and out combat whilst others require surviving a set number of turns, recovering cargo, or disabling enemies without killing them. Gathering scrap, war assets, blueprints, experience, and augmentations is vital to success but even though death is permanent, it is not a setback. Your score is added to a Global Unlock tally that rewards you with many permanent perks, pilots, and vehicles which not only boost your chances but make replaying an absolute pleasure.\n\nVisually, both sides of this genre combination are often underwhelming. The art style involved here is really quite appealing with the character portraits and general tone evoking a convincing steampunk era. The animations of the mechs, from the arcs of energy weapons to flames billowing out of weakened components are a cool touch but it's understated throughout. The simplicity does get a little repetitive after extended playtime but your focus will rarely linger on the imagery for long periods.\n\nI've said it before and it's worth reiterating, Ironcast is unforgiving. It's also inventive, smart, rewarding, and satisfying to the degree that all other games have fallen to the wayside since I started. This review was ready for writing at the 6 hour mark so all extra hours since have been pure indulgence and addiction. In a genre so devoid of even attempting to innovate, Ironcast is a masterpiece and quite easily one of my favourites games of this year.","March 26, 2015","true","22.1"," 47 of 60 people (78%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","78","47","60","7","0"

It's a lot more involved than your usual match 3 game with several things to think about during each turn. Do you aim specifically for their shields to lower their defences or maybe try to knock out one of their weapons to lessen the damage they mete out? You're running out of coolant and only have enough left to either fire a shot off with one of your weapons or to raise your shields. Not always an easy choice.\n\nVisuals are nice - They've really got that Steampunk Victoriana thing done well. The various mechs and characters you can unlock are pretty well designed.\n\nBe warned though, this isn't some casual  Match 3 game that you can play on autopilot. It demands you pay attention to what you're doing as the difficulty can start to ramp up. You never have quite enough money to buy the upgrades you want so are always scrambling for enough cash to pay for repairs and buy that new cannon that's available. There's a fair amount of challenge involved. Not  bad thing in my book but like I say, just be aware it's not some casual bejewelled type of game.\n\nI've put ten hours in over two days so definitely has that "one more turn" addictiveness for me.","March 26, 2015","true","20.9"," 32 of 40 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","32","40","0","0"

Even if you get a lucky streak and a well upgraded mech all it takes is a couple of bad turns, with tiles refusing to drop, and as soon as you can't put your defenses up you'll be toast and have to start over.\n\nThe global unlocks generally do little to make things better, and having to restart over and over hoping to get to the first boss, only to generally be destroyed by the aforementioned issues, gets tiring eventually.\n\nI can see Ironcast possibly being a good game for hardcore players who don't mind rng being so brutal, but for the average player having so little control over what happens, the frustrating range and the dull grind make this a game I can't recommend.","June 22, 2015","false","11.8"," 23 of 28 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","23","28","0","3"

In theory, it should be perfect for me. Permadeath, resource management, strategic match-three gameplay, steam-punk aesthetic: it all sounds tailor-made for me. And yet, I don't enjoy it nearly as much as I'd hoped.\n\nThe game apes FTL: Faster than Light a fair bit too, but misses a few key design decisions. FTL has a limited timeframe to build up your vessel to handle the end-boss just like this does, but taking risks with your time management can yield great rewards there. Here, there's no risks to take with your turn timer, the strategy only comes through during the actual games, in between those there's little to no reward for good play.\n\nThe other big gripe I have is the meta-progress. The end-boss is horrifically overpowered (again, just like in FTL), but in FTL, you get better at the game the more you play it, until you beat the boss. In this game, the boss will pound you into a pulp until you've leveled up your "meta level" enough to stand a chance. That isn't fun. t first, I really liked this desgin choice: when a run goes awry on the last boss in FTL, you feel like you've thrown away 2 hours of your life with nothing to show for it and Ironcast remedies that with its meta-progression. At the very least, you've made subsequent runs easier. But these meta-levels feel like requirements to have a chance against the boss. I doubt the boss is killable on your first playthrough, you have to grind out some levels to make it a fair fight and that is just annoying as sin.\n\n\nTL:DR Get FTL instead, unless you're really dead set on seeing what these folks did to the match-3 genre. It's not a bad game, as such, but slips on a few crucial points that result in a frustrating game. And that's dispite all its charm, which it has in spades.","March 30, 2015","false","9.7"," 53 of 81 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","53","81","0","1"

The battle system is easy to use, but difficult to master. An important thing I learned for instance was that you really have to consider the match-3 game as just an opportunity to get the upper hand (a buff if you will) and that the true tactics are how you will use the resources you already have this turn, not the ones you may get in the 3-match.\n\nThe different types of missions that you get to pick from add a level of fantastic customization to each game. Do I risk a hard mission for a potentially big payout or do I do a medium difficulty one? Do I do a salvage mission (Try to defeat your enemy without destroying one specific component of theirs) or do I go for a battle or a collection mission?\n\nMy favorite component to this game is that every single game I have played has been AMAZINGLY different and unique.

Then this might be the game for you.\n\nFirst of all this game is a ton of fun, more so than I first thought it would be. I am not one to usually enjoy match 3 games or rogue-likes but this one really was unique. The gameplay was challenging but not overly so. You could still enjoy the game for what it was rather than constantly worrying about your next move. That’s not to say that it’s easy. You will have to make a few runs of this before your mech and pilot are strong enough to save the day. But when you do you feel epic.\n\nThe world building in this game is great; I really wanted to explore the alternate steam punk 1800’s far more than I could. But what was offered was very interesting. The mechs look great and the fight backgrounds were pretty interesting too. The story was not too deep but what was there was highly enjoyable.\n\nWith a variety of characters to play as and several robots to pilot there is a lot of replayability. I found myself wanting to start a new run as soon as I died just to try out a new set of abilities and skills. And with the huge variety of weapons, mods, skills and abilities on offer you can play in a style to suit yourself. Want huge cannons go for it, want to ditch the shield for huge amounts of armour, sure why not.\n\nIf you want to immerse yourself in an interesting world and have a blast doing it then this game is for you.

And WOW! Great fun! A nice mixture of Rogue-alike systems, Match-3 and turn-based combat.\n\nThe story is simple: in a steampunk setting France is invading the British mainland - and it is you job to stop them. You do that by controlling a steampunk mech (an 'ironcast') through ten missions before finally confronting the main boss. Until then you level up (gaining HP and special abilities), improve your ironcast using salvaged equipment and try to gather as many resources as possible for the big end fight. In the end you want as much manpower (reduces the final boss' HP) and scrap (=money to upgrade your ironcast) as you can get.\n\nThe missions range from simple battles against one or more enemies (one after another), salvage missions (bringing down enemies without damaging specific parts like for example the shields or weapons), collection missions (collecting crates while fighting) and survival (survive for a given number of rounds). Sometimes these missions are pepped up with having your cooling system damaged or requiring you not to stop, or having to fix your jammed weapons before being able to engage the enemy. There's also trade missions (non-combat) where you exchange one resource (scrap vs manpower) by negociating with potential allies.\n\nYou have to power your systems with the elements you match in a match-3 style. Per combat turn you can perform three matches and as many other actions as your resources (ammunition, power, coolant, repair tokens and abilities) allow. You can match as many neighbouring elements of the same color as you like (not just rows or columns) as long as your line doesn't intersect itself. Using special tokens you can chain different colors, and there's power ups, scrap (i.e. money to upgfrade your ironcast) and - for some missions - special crates you have to collect.\n\nUsing your resources you power your shields (damage reduction), weapons or drivers (evasion), and you need coolant tokens as you activate these systems. Shields and movement can be activated up to three levels (for increased protection) and then loose one level each turn. So you have to constantly refresh them to keep them up. You can target specific systems (weapons, drive or shields) on the the enemy units, of which there are basically two types: tanks and ironcasts. They differ in that tanks have armour (damage reduction by %) and ironcasts have shields (absolute damage reduction per hit - rendering some weaker but multishot weapons useless against more powerful shields).\n\nOnce you die the game is over and you next game starts, the missions and level-up bonuses are choosen randomly (you have a choice, but the selection you're offered is mainly random). Also: no saves or anything. So it's a rogue-like of a sort. But after each game your XP get added to your global score and you can unlock new commanders and ironcasts models (each with specific abilities), bonuses or additional abilities. So even if you don't beat the boss (or even reach it) you still get a feeling of continuing progress which is good to overcome the initial frustration (especially if you're not too good at games like this).\n\nAll in all it's a great game, with a charming story and art style, solid gameplay and well worth a few rounds.

It's a unique take on what many writers now refer to as an FTL style game. I preview the game in the video above. Below are my initial thoughts on Ironcast and it's DLC.\n\nA review copy of Ironcast was provided to TheHiddenLevels.com by Dreadbit and Ripstone, for that we thank them greatly.\n\nIroncast is a very well styled game with a steampunk art motif and an incredible amount of character. The gameplay is fun and challenging, with the rougue-lite aspect it feels fresh at all times. Like many of the rouge type games, there is a benefit to all of your future mechs as you more, you gain global modifiers that are consistent from game to game. It's a refreshing and fun game, easy to learn, and has quite a bit of replay value.\n\nI spent quite a bit of time feeling the game was too easy, until I encountered a few losses in a row and realized that poor choices generally equal poor results, regardless of difficulty. Keeping things like shields and movement up and repaired and paying attention to mission objectives is important, I failed to do so in the first fight in the video above and you see my mech get melted. Unlocking a new mech after that made it worth every piece of scrap, very satisfying.\n\nThe random aspect I find to be a part of the roughelike genre and I expect at times to run into a nearly unwinnable situation or to get poor resource nodes. The nodes however you can control to an extent by grouping rather than gunning for what you need immediately, that part is less RNG and more of a logic puzzle. The whole package fits together well and plays very smoothly. I enjoy the stlye of gameplay because it allows you to walk away and come back at any time for the most part. I have my 19 month old son around, yet this is playable throughout the day since I'm not concerned with a timer.\n\nI can't find much reason not to reccommed this one. I've seen some gripes about RNG, but that is expected, and challenges are welcomed on my part. I think the art is fantastic, the music while not my taste fits the motif and is well done. There are very few games that play this well and mix so many elements together in such a clean streamlined manner. This is one I will be spending time with regularly, I'd certainly reccomend checking this out, the replay value is genuinely high on this one.\n\nThanks for watching and reading, check out www.thehiddenlevels.com for news and reviews!","November 17, 2015","true","4.5"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","10","14","0","0"

The graphics is adequate and stylish, the story nicely designed, the music good (however more tracks would be desired). The game features a nice system of mech upgrading and a great idea of cumulative overall experience level. When you are killed (and you can take it for granted you WILL be killed in five-to-ten first attmpets to beat the campaign) or when you win the campaign, all collected experience points are added to a common pool. And when you level up in this, you unlock very neat ironcast augmentations and other useful items, such as bonuses to exp, scrap or HP. This encourages to play the campaign again and again - and it is not boring, becase the available missions arre somewhat randomly selected. Summarizing - a really great game worth the money it costs.

On my first try I failed after around 30 minutes, but I had fun. On my second try, I beat the game after around 4 hours and I had lots of fun and some very tense moments. On my third try, I used a newly unlocked officer, a newly unlocked Ironcast, and I didn't really have all that much fun anymore. Even though I had unlocked a bunch of stuff with all the exp from my second try, it just felt like I was doing more of the same and there was nothing interesting waiting anymore, my new officer for example was only the different picture and one different ability. In the game's defense: I get bored of games that have nothing new to offer anymore quicker than most people. So you might get more hours out of this than I did. But where a game like Risk of Rain or FTL or BoI have tons of random abilities and encounters and classes that are very different from each other, here every playthrough feels too much like the ones before it, since barely anything changes.\n\ntl;dr: Generally recommending the game, it's quite beautiful and fun, but there is not enough stuff mixing up your playthroughs, so you might not keep hitting that retry button as much as you would in other rogue-lites.","March 31, 2015","true","6.6"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

After playing for 5 hours I feel like I've seen just about everything. There are different vehicles you can use, and different commanders, but they only change the game slightly. The campaign just needs to be longer. The game is also just too easy.\n\nFTL did such a great job making the game difficult and replayable. Ironcast could be the same if the campaign was longer and the battles had more variety. I still think it's worth picking the game up since it's only $10 right now.

Everything is just what it should be.\n\nAs for the negative reviews concerning the change from the classical match3 gampelay mechanics: Yes, it is frustrating that you can not see what the opponent is matching. BUT, I never felt cheated. It is a cruel game, sometimes you will have an all-you-can-eat-buffet of tiles, sometimes you will cry for at least ONE MORE COOLANT. But it was never unfair. If you stick along with it for a while, you will understand and learn to love its system. I was beaten like a little child the first time I played the boss, but I gained 5 global levels getting to it, so the next time around it was easier (still a bi***, though and still a fail, but I will keep on reaching for the stars).\n\nFor all of you lovers of Puzzle Quest like games, and definitely for steampunk lovers (I myself was not one before this game), this is a must buy at an RSP of around 10 EUR during the current sale.

You have two weapons and two defensive moves that can be used every round. Both kind of devices use different resources (minus coolant as that is used for both) you also get to do 3 matches on the gem board to gather resources for said skills.

I don't feel like there is much I can do to improve my chances of winning any one match, and every match has the odds stacked against me.\n\nIf you think flipping a coin enough times to get 20 heads in a row is fun, then I'd suggest doing just that as it only costs you the coin, and even that only if you happen to lose it while flipping.\n\nThe UI is also lacking. I can't easily check my own machine's stats during combat, so I need to remember my max ammo slots, energy slots, coolant slots, and repair slots. I can't easily skip the texts that I've seen, as I first need to read a few lines to see if they are new or old. The UI makes me wait stuff, when I just want to get to the next screen already. Effectiveness of projectiles, energy weapons, etc against different opponents is best done by trial and error, since you'll be doing that (=dying) a lot anyway.\n\nPretty much anytime I happen to get a rare blueprint I'm guaranteed to die the next round when I have that piece on the machine. I've only done maybe 20 matches, and I'm mostly frustrated. I've tried upgrading my guns first, I've tried upgrading my shields first, I've tried upgrading my drives first. I usually die first.\n\nSo, I just don't get this type of "rogue like". What is the point of just dying constantly based on a biased flip of a coin? "For every 100 times you fail, your base success rate is increased by 1% point, from the initial 1%, up to a maximum of 49%"?\n\nI play games that are fun and engaging.

After the third or fourth death, the fun goes away but you have not learned much that would help you survive any longer.\n\nFor some, this might be worth 10-15 euros, but to me this is a 1 eur failure.

It really is worth buying if you're a huge puzzle quest fan, but do not expect this to get even near to the same level in terms of complexity and build diversity.","March 26, 2015","false","3.8"," 52 of 98 people (53%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","53","52","98","0","10"

You tell yourself you'll do tings differently next time. In Ironcast it's like you're smashing your head in to a brick wall until the wall breaks. You rely way too heavily on the random number generator to give you favorable gems to match.\n\nI found that it's best to try to end a fight as soon as possible because if you don't then the gem board tends to become unmanagable where you can hardly match anything, like there's a bunch of gems stuck at the bottom of the board that you can't do anything with.\n\nWhat would have been more beneficial to this game would be to have more board manipulation abilities (like Puzzle Quest) so you don't end up with an unmanageable board.\n\nI have a strong feeling the devs only tested this game for bugs but never tested it to see if it was any fun.\n\nI think they could have done something more intuitive with the "target enemy parts" panel.

I thought they were speaking a foreign language. I don't think I heard a single consonant. But fortunately, Ironcast comes out of the box with subtitles.\n\nSeventy years after Jane Austen died--beloved author of “Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels”--you get to strap yourself into a 7 meter tall mechanized war machine and and do what every red blooded American wants to do: blow sheet up and drive away without looking at the explosions (preferably while being filmed in slow motion while blasting Death Metal).\n\nI have to pause at this point in the review to break out a calculator to convert those crazy British metric measurements. Wow, those Mechs are about 23 feet tall! That is a lot taller than I thought. Gee, that foreign metric system seems a lot more efficient and simpler to use than our American system: 1) one unit for each quantity, 2) scalability by combining units, and 3) you can do freaking unit conversion without math by SHIFTING A DECIMAL FREAKING POINT. NO FLIPPING WONDER THE WHOLE FREAKING WORLD USES IT.\n\nBut I digress. I died on an Ironcast mission where the bureaucrats risked the entire war effort--and one of its famous captains--to go behind enemy lines for a vital UK resource; that is, 6 boxes of flipping tea leaves. I warned you this game  is British. AND THE DEVS EXPECT US TO BELIEVE THAT THEY THOUGHT OF THIS WHEN ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTEEN YEARS EARLIER IN AN ALTERNATE TIME STREAM AMERICA INNOVATED THE BOSTON FREAKING TEA PARTY........ CHILDHOOD RUINED EVERYTHING RUINED!!!1!\n\nBut I digress. Ironcast has permadeath but with great replayability due to global unlocks, augmentations, great turn based combat mechanics, upgradable subsystems, targetable enemy subsystems, incredibly hot Victorian chicks surrounded by really homely Victorian guys so you know the babes are just waiting for you to swoop in and rescue them along with their heaving bosoms...\n\nAnd let’s not forget, these guys know the life and death value of tea leaves: Oi, fancy a cuppa?","May 3, 2015","true","12.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","100","3","3","4","0"

And whilst it's a good mixing, with good ideas and a cool setting, it doesn't fix the bit issue of FTL, where sometimes you reach the end and the game hasn't deigned to give you the stuff you need to win. On top of that, the match board is a little small, making it even more variant, as sometimes you have good enough guns but just don't get the ammo for them. Overall, the UI is a little cludgy too - selecting your lines is a little too sticky and can feel alward, there are no hotkeys for the menus and the only way to close menu popups are at the bottom, rather than the typical upper corners.\n\nOverall, it's a solid implementation of a good idea, but it just falls flat as an overall experience. With a bit of RNG nudging to guarentee a baseline power level going in to the bosses, it would be really good.

The game has the randomness of the FTL and the strategic thinking of PQ WITHOUT the randomness factor. This is just huge. While it is still a bit luck based, strategic thinking while connecting the available resources on your board ill lead to victory.\n\nNot a TL;DR In-depth:\n\n1. The Game in general.\n\n1. Like FTL: Make your own vehicle from a bunch of given presets, upgrade and augment it with stuff you find on the battlefield and go for victory.\n2. Like FTL: randomness and replayability at its best.\n3. Like FTL: varying encounters with different goals to go for.\n4. Like Puzzle Quest: you have a board with gems - here you have resources.\n5. Like Puzzle Quest: you need to match the resources, with the difference that you can go diagonally.\n6. Like Puzzle Quest: There is still some randomness.\n7. You lose, you die. Simple.\n8. UN-like 90% of FTL: you have intel (unless you have FTL info of the map which is rare), and you can prepare.\n9. UN-like 60% of FTL: you know what the mission's all about. Not just "there is an enemy starship in this area"\n10. UN-like Puzzle Quest: you have your own board and you can plan ahead. You can even strategicaly make a huge 12-tile chain just to open up more board space.\n11. UN-like Puzzle Quest: the enemy can't foil your plans with your own pieces. Only bad luck can - or yourself, for that matter.\n12. UN-like Puzzle Quest: The is no luck factor to enemy beating you using your own board and making you smash your screen.\n13. UN-like both of them: you have way bigger control over what happens in a mission.\n\nThe Battles:\n\n1. Enemies vary, and are interesting - you need to examine an enemy and attack it in a specific manner.\n2. Simple mouse clicking is your doom. Using your brain wins battles.\n3. The various ironcasts have different abilities. Play to the advantage or detriment of those.\n4. Battle variety is huge, with boss battles every 10 turns thrown in for good masure.\n5. You have shields, movement, evasion, hull, everything you need to defeat the enemy. Or lose.\n\nThe Rest:\n\nIs mediocre.

I have finished the game with all the available characters and all the different Ironcasts. I have also completed every achievement in the game. The game is a "match-3" battle puzzler with roguelike features and I think it pulls both off well.\n\nI will list my thoughts below and also try to write down suggestions on how to combat problems and enhance the gameplay.\n\nThe combat system is pretty solid. Since it's "match-3" based, it is also based on luck, but with the Global Unlock system, you start to get better and better as you die and progress. In my opinion, this benefits the game, since it lets you move forward, albeit slowly in the beginning. The combat will get repetitive and I don't think there's much to do about that, the game already has Abilities and Passives to change things around a bit, but if you don't like Puzzle Quest-like gameplay, then this is not the game for you.\nSuggestions: None right now, the problem lies elsewhere, with the lack of weapon types and such, see below.\n\nThe story is surprisingly good, the missions are well thought out but differ too little: one "kill the enemy" mission is nearly exactly the same as another, sometimes it's one and sometimes it's two enemies to destroy. That there are two types of enemies to encounter, the Ironcast and Tanks, makes up for this, but not for long. There are a few different mission types but many are basically the same, differing only in story, which has no effect on the actual gameplay. There are exceptions though: certain missions forces you to obey certain rules. But when you have to choose between one mission with these conditions, which sometimes offer no additional rewards and makes the level much harder, and another mission which is just "kill the enemy", it's often better to go with the latter. Missions marked as Hard are also very seldom worth it, the risk of taking damage is not equal to the actual benefit of completing a Hard mission and I am not even sure if it increases the droprate of rare items.\nSuggestions: Adding bonus objectives that offer bonus rewards and/or resources would make many of the missions with victory conditions worthwhile. Also, rewarding players who complete Hard Missions with a higher chance for rare items, or making this more obvious, in case of it already being the case.\n\nThere are no random missions, per se, as they are all pre generated, but the path to them changes. The beginning is always the same, with the same three missions being available. It's not like FTL, in which the beginning is always different and different zones offer different challenges. All in all, it feels less random than I thought it would and in the end I think all the missions that are in the game will be available to the player in every campaign, if you manage to survive till the end of course, and the same missions will often be offered at the same time in the campaign. In contrast, I felt that some of the more "story based" missions, where you trade resources for other things, were totally random and I never felt sure what answer I should pick to get the reaction I wanted.\nSuggestions: In this game, more is more. More missions equals more variety equals more replayability. I would also love it if it would matter in some missions which character, gear or Ironcast you were using, to make the game feel more reactive to my choices as a player. As it is now, even the ending doesn't change based on the character you are playing...\n\nSadly there are very few item types, seven different weapons and two different types of defense and drive items. I thought the developers had countered this problem with rare effects or uses in rare items, but sadly this is not the case. Rare items are almost identical to none-rare items, only better, which is a little lackluster. In the game there are two types of enemies you can meet but you as a player never get to pilot a Tank, which I thought was a little sad. Not that they differ that much from Ironcasts, but I would have liked to have had the choice.\nSuggestions: The game would benefit from having a rare item changing the way you build your Ironcast, by adding an effect or changing the way a game mechanic work, like causing damage over time on the enemy or locking up their movement, and so on.\n\nThe user interface suffers from some lack of information, especially in the Hangar part of the game. When you want to upgrade your max energy, ammo, coolant or repair levels, there's no tooltip or indicator telling you what your current max level is. This is annoying, especially if you pick up the game after a break, since it means you can potentially "waste" resources upgrading something which didn't help you at the moment.\nSuggestions: Add tooltips or indicators to the Hangar zone, indicating current levels for more than just the current HP.\n\nLevels offer increased HP and a choice between some Abilities and Passive effects, which I think is a good mechanic. It adds to the randomness, which I personally like in roguelikes, and makes each game a little different. That being said, some Abilities and Passives are vastly superior compared to others. Being able to spawn a Link Node each time you link ten or more nodes in one go can't be compared to a "5 %" higher spawn rate of a certain node. In the beginning, the Global Unlock system rewards the player with new Abilities and Passives but once you reach a certain point, there are no more to unlock and the rewards change to bonuses in HP and XP gain, which are good but not as fun.\nSuggestions: Some Abilities and Passives needs to be rebalanced or packaged together, to make them a viable choice.\n\nArt wise, I like it alot. The game lives and breathes steampunk and I love the big brass machines and the look of the weapons and so on. I would love it if the enemy didn't look exactly  the same as my own Ironcast though, and the same thing goes for their weapons and weapons animations and effects.\nSuggestions: Even just varying the enemy Ironcast's size or color tint would make me feel more unique as a player. Adding the ability to put up a custom emblem or icon on my Ironcast would also let me feel more attached to my beast of war.\n\nBoss fights can be challenging, but I felt I could pretty much steam-roll them once I reached a high enough Global Unlock level. This, I think was also somewhat intended, and I didn't feel I got stuck as much in this game as in other roguelikes.\nSuggestions: Perhaps giving the bosses some kind of special power or ability would spice things up a bit. As they are now, it's pretty easy to predict their actions.\n\nIn summary, this is the type of game which will benefit greatly from an expansion that increases the amount of available content in the game.","April 30, 2015","true","55.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

There, I said it.  Truth is, I wasn't sure I wanted to like it.  See, it's a bit like Candy Crush (I think) in its basic make-up.  The only thing I really know about Candy Crush is that I regularly mock my wife for playing it too much.  And it's a bit creepy how some Barry White-sounding guy keeps going "Sweet" and "Delicious" and it seems to give my wife some sort of freakish jollies.  But I digress...\n\nI decided to try this game because of the whole Steam Punk setting.  You're not sliding your finger over candy in this game, you're matching components that allow you to unleash mechanical mayhem -- and no one throughout the entire game ever says "Tasty".  I know this because I finished it and it never came up.\n\nSo anyway, other than the cool robot and technological linking sounds, I wasn't overly blown away at first.  It wasn't that hard and it didn't seem to require much in the way of actual thought -- which is pretty much how I envisioned my wife's Candy Crush addiction.  So, I got to the first Boss, and he totally kicked my posterial lobe.  It wasn't even close.  My first thought, of course, was ... "Wait, all the early boards be so easy and the Bad Guy is unbeatable."  So, I did what any tried-and-true gamer did -- I started playing a different game that massaged my ego more adequately.\n\nBut I thought about Ironcast a couple of days later ... and I decided to try again.  At which point I got my butt kicked again.   I again stopped playing, but I found myself returning to Ironcast, and I started figuring a few things out... and then it hit me:  This game was actually making me think!   I don't want to give away much in the way of strategy, but the game allows you upgrades that can totally turn the tide of the battles if the correct combination is used.\n\nThe hardest part of the game is getting the correct upgrades (it's a bit randomized) AND getting the chance at the right weapons/equipment  (again chance).  Just when I started figuring things out, I could pretty much beat the First Boss every time.  Then I got to the second Boss... and the entire process repeated.  "This guy is impossible.  I quit.  Well, maybe I'll try again.  This guy is still impossible,  Wait, maybe I should try this...  etc"  In the end, I finally won the game, and I actually felt good about it.  Again, I had to think.  I give Ironcast a definite thumbs-up.  Candy Crush still sucks though.","July 7, 2015","true","35.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

Ironcast mixes elements of Puzzle Quest and games like Faster Than Light to great effect. You'll control a pilot (with further unlockable options) in a mech (also with extra unlockable models) that you take into various battle types over the course of a few days. The battles will be randomized and you'll earn scrap and modifications that you can use to upgrade your rig. Eventually you'll come to a boss battle and choices you made throughout the playthrough will affect how well you do against the final boss.\n\nThat's the game in a nutshell, and it's awesome.

I have to admit that I like the "3 turns" until your enemy makes a move deal, as "Puzzle Quest" would sometimes get unfair when your 3-match revealed a killer combo that fell from above that your opponent could make use of on their turn.

Hmm bizarre, vous avez dit bizarre ?\nMais c'est souvent des mélanges incongrus que naissent les jeux les plus accrocheurs. Et Ironcast fait partie de ces jeux qui occupent une partie de notre esprit jusqu'à ce que le satané boss de fin soit mort en enterré.\n\nLe pitch est simple mais amusant. Anglais et Français se livrent une guerre sans merci vers la fin du XIXème et utilisent une ressource spéciale qui leur permet d'avoir des armes avancées pour l'époque. Ces fameux méchas sont donc l'alpha et l'oméga de cette guerre et vous incarnez plus ou moins un pilote de mécha émérite, chargé de défendre Londres d'une menace majeure.\n\nTout cela s'articule au travers de missions générées aléatoirement (hormis les boss) et fournissant en cas de succès de l'xp, de l'or et des points de guerre. Dans l'ordre ces ressources vous permettent de débloquer des pouvoirs actifs/passifs, de convertir des plans obtenus lors des missions en armes et défenses pour rendre votre mécha inarrêtable, et d'affaiblir le prochain boss. Ne vous enflammez pas, des boss il n'y en a que 2 . Et les missions aléatoires (type attaques, survie, collecte d'objets...) ne sont là que pour vous préparer à ces affrontements majeurs.\n\nUne fois que vous avez sélectionné une mission sur la carte (il y a toujours 3 choix par défaut), vous affrontez des méchas adverses au tour par tour. C'est là que le match 3 intervient. En effet, en combinant les bonnes gems sur la grille, vous remplissez vos jauges d'énergie, de réparation, de refroidissement et de munitions. Il n'y a plus qu'à dépenser ces points pour activer vos boucliers, vous déplacer (permet d'éviter des tirs ennemis) et ouvrir le feu. A chaque tour, vous pouvez effectuer 3 combinaisons donc il y a souvent des choix à faire. Notez que plus vous êtes doué à ce mini-jeu, plus vous obtenez d'xp supplémentaire à la fin des missions. Donc il faut faire les durer ces scénarios au maximum pour monter vite en niveau.\n\nQuant au rogue-like, c'est simplement qu'il y a beaucoup d'aléatoire dans le jeu : les missions, les ennemis, les plans trouvés, les objets rares disponibles, les capacités obtenus en montant de niveau... mille et une façons d'avoir un tirage horrible qui vous flingue une run en 2 minutes.\n\nOui c'est cruel Ironcast, mais ce n'est pas non plus sadique. Car en sus des niveaux liés à une run, vous gagnez des niveaux de façon générale lorsque vous terminez une campagne (en gagnant ou en mourant). Donc on nous fouette mais on nous récompense un peu :)\n\nJ'admets malgré tout que le plaisir numéro un est d'enfin baffer le boss de fin et qu'une fois fait, j'ai peur de ne plus avoir envie de relancer le jeu. C'est donc intense mais relativement bref. Mais le positionnement prix semble juste :)\n\nAh par contre, préparez-vous à ce que vos amis vous tapent sur l'épaule en vous disant "ah tu vois, toi aussi t'aimes candy crush". Je pense qu'il fallait vous le dire, car sans préparation vous risquez de ne pas  trouver la réplique qui sauvera votre réputation pour les 10 prochaines années.\n\nAllez une petite vidéo sur le sujet !\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=420625572","April 10, 2015","true","10.9"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","7","12","0","0"

"Oh, he fixed shields. Oh, he fired weapons. I guess he had resources for it". The only thing you see is the coolant. This gives you a strong feeling that the enemy is playing some other game, and it also makes your token matching less exciting. You don't need to worry about enemy stealing some resources you'll about to need soon - instead you need to worry not to match too much (see below). The fear of enemy making good moves was the essence of Puzzle Quest. This a major buzz killer for me.\n\nI do like the fact that when you die, you get this campaign XP that gives you unlocks. But I still miss the way Puzzle Quest or 10000000 worked. I could keep on trying, find alternative routes, improve your stats etc.\n\nMy third issue is a pure UI/UX issue. Not being to able to see my max stats for bullets, energy, coolant or repair is just stupid. You have to memorize that "ok I can get 8 bullets max" and then when matching you need to calculate in your head whether the match will go over or not - because everything over the max cap is just wasted. I wish the game would display the max cap and somehow inform when the match is going to be wasteful.\n\nIt's a gorgeous looking and sounding game, but I don't think I have desire to play it much further...\n\nEDIT: fixed some typos and pruned the review a bit","March 29, 2015","false","1.7"," 10 of 18 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","10","18","0","0"

Ironcast is played out in a Steampunk Victorian England where players duke it out in huge mechs. Players link together nodes of specific types in order to do things such as power up their weapons, repair their mechs, and boost up shields as well as other tasks. For what seems like a basic ‘Match 3’ puzzler, there is an incredible amount of depth here. Each pilot and mech has unique stats and can further be customized through purchasing equipment and using augmentations. This game is addictive, punishing, and something totally fresh. Each battle is a total blast to play and delivers the same action and intensity as a tournament fighter or shooter while also giving you the depth and strategy of an RPG or TGC.","January 3","true","8.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I had no additional input on surveys, etc., during development, so this is based entirely on my point of view of the game after playing it following release.\n\nIroncast describes itself as "Puzzlequest meets FTL in this Steampunk Victorian era roguelite.", and as the reference to Puzzlequest implies, Ironcast is a Match-3 game and gameplay is also turn-based. The objects that you are matching on the board are known as 'nodes', and these affect your Ironcast in terms of available ammunition (purple), energy (orange), coolant (blue), or repair tools (green).\n\nYour Ironcast can only hold a limited number of each resource at any one time (i.e 9 ammunition, 10 energy, 20 coolant, 10 repair), which is where part of the games strategy comes into effect. When I first started playing this game I was selecting as many nodes as I could fit into a match, however after watching others play the game I soon realised that this may not be the best way to go. Only collecting the amount that will fill your maximum meter allows you to not waste resources, and also allows you to strategically position other nodes on the board.\n\nI have heard complaints of this game being repetitive, which it is, but as far as I am concerned all Match-3 style games are (or certainly all the ones I have ever played). It is the additional content in this game - the global unlocks, the gameplay strategy, the attacking targeting system, the workshop, the choice of commanders/Ironcasts, etc., that give this game longevity.\n\nI am only 3.5hrs in to this game currently, and I have unlocked one new commander and one new Ironcast to use in battle, and will continue to work my way through obtaining the rest of the currently locked content.\n\nIf you are a fan of the Puzzlequest style Match-3 games, I see no reason why you would not like Ironcast. It is surprisingly strategic (as it took me some time to work out), and the global unlocks give you a reason to continue to play after each death on the battlefield. I would definitely recommend that you give this a try if you are normally a fan of this genre.","May 8","true","3.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Although it looks like a casual-style game, and is just as accessible, it is much more than that.\n\nIf you fail a mission, there is no redo. You move on, damaged, with that quest failed for the rest of the campaign. Choosing one mission precludes you choosing the other two available missions for the rest of the campaign which makes replayablility high. And you WILL replay it, as at some point, your Ironcast with get crushed in battle and you will start again. However, this time, you will have a few upgrades available to all of your ironclads becuase of the progress that you made in previous campaigns.\n\nAdd in the unlockable abilities, new pilots, new ironclads, leveling up, and random loot drops with differing rarities and you have a real mission-based, loot-driven RPG experience. Overall, it is a very fun game that will fool you into thinking that it's just a casual match 3 game until the ordinance starts flying, your systems are going off-line and you can't match enough coolant to use what systems you have left.\n\nIf you like rogue-likes, try this jaunt down a side trail and see what you think. If you like match 3 games, use the skills that you've learned playing them to step up to the next tier in difficulty. It's a beautiful piece of playable art.\n\nOverall, a very enjoyable and mostly unique experience.\n\nM13","June 19, 2015","true","3.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I know, I know... there are many, many good games on Steam and the Indie market is quite saturated. However, it saddens me to see this game with less than 500 user reviews. It deserves more attention, not a profound amount more, but definitely more.\n\nIroncast\nSo what is Ironcast? Well its a cool blend of match 3 (or more) gameplay mixed with turn based strategy gameplay. It has rogue-like elements with random system (loot) drops and random perk progression as well as an overall progression which slowly increases your stats for each proceeding play through. It has one hell of a cool aesthetic, which is victorian era Steampunk set in London. You're one of the last surviving Ironcast commanders for England as France has declared war on your nation, and it's your job to protect against the invaders. With multiple characters and Ironcasts to choose from, each playthrough can be rather unique. A playthrough could lead down a walking tank path, with your Ironcast having huge health and dolling out massive damage. Or it could be an evasive, speedy Ironcast that can pump out lots of rounds but is susceptible to direct hits. Each play through can be quite different with all the starting options and random nature of the beast.\n\nPros\n\nThe pros for this $15 game far outweigh the cons. The setting is awesome, especially if you like Steampunk, and the art style is superb, it fits the game and gameplay like a glove. Each play through has the potential to be entirely different and has fairly good variety in the missions. The game is absolutely challenging, but this is also somewhat of a negative that I will discuss more in the Cons. The progression system is solid and gives rewards consistently. The combat and puzzle elements are addicting and very, very fun. And lastly, the animation quality and visual effects are just a joy to watch. I'm sure i've missed some things, but those are the biggest pros.\n\n- $15 Rogue-like with high replayability\n- Excellent and authentic London Steampunk setting and aesthetic\n- Solid progression system with good variety\n- Really, really addictive and fun gameplay\n- Easy to pick up but diffictult to master strategy systems\n- Unflinchingly challenging\n- Excellent sound effects and sound design\n- Great animation quality and visual fidelity\n- Solid customization system\n\nCons\n\nSome of the cons are a bit nit picky, but there are definitely some things that need mentioning. The story is lackluster, but it really isn't what's going to keep you playing a game like this anyway. The mission variety is there, it has decent variety, but some of the mission types seem lopsided against you in a bad way. Also, some of the mission types I found myself ignoring every chance I had, other mission types I chose nearly every time. This could have been better. I would have liked to have had a larger roster of characters and Ironcasts, but this could just be because I absolutely love their designs and just want to see more. Finally, the games difficulty. The game can be downright brutal at times. Just when you feel you're putting together a good run, you could end up with a terrible roll of the dice and lose everything. A lot of the frustration can be chalked up to the random nature of rogue-likes, but it was a serious hurdle for me. Even on a normal difficulty mission I'd sometimes be just blindsided by a terrible turn of events and lose my Ironcast, and death is permanent.\n\nAt one point, I was ready to quit playing the game out of frustration. Though the very next game I beat Durant and made it all the way to the Interloper... so maybe I was just being a baby :) ... I died with the Interloper at only 1900 hp.... SO CLOSE! ... i'll get you next time, you ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥!\n\n- Throw away story\n- Mixed bag of mission variety\n- Random nature rogue-like can cause frustration\n- Difficulty had me boiling at one point\n- Would have been nice to have more character and Ironcast variety\n\nOverall\nOverall, this game is absolutely worth $15. I got it on sale, and I kind of wish I didn't because I feel these developers deserve more support. I'm almost certainly going to pick up the DLC at some point soon because the game has its hooks in me. It has a few down sides and it can frustrating as all hell, but when this game shines, it shines like the sun. Rarely do you see the Steampunk aesthetic and it's always awesome when you do. This game has it in spades and does it flawlessly.\n\nIroncast is a really, really fun and addictive rogue-like turn-based strategy game that deserves more attention than it's gotten. It's a pretty damn unique mix of genres and is absolutely beautiful to look at and play. If that isn't enough for you to buy it, then pick it up during a good sale and just give it a chance. I truly believe most who play this game, even if you aren't interested in Steampunk, will enjoy what they get. And if you're a fan of tanks like I am, just imagine your own personal, walking, victorian era tank... it gets me giddy every time :)\n\n9/10","December 16, 2015","true","24.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It's turn based, so you have as long as you need to make decisions.\n\nBetween battles you also need to decide what blueprints to build and upgrades to take, and similar to jumping to another system in FTL you have a choice of 3 battles each time before the countdown ends and you do the final boss battle.\n\nI also enjoy the artwork and animation in combat, especially smashed ironcasts.\n\nOverall I've had a lot of fun during the first six hours I played, though I only managed to get to the final boss once.

It always seems so odd to me that you are supposed to progress by losing. What I find repeatedly happening to me is that I'll be trying to save up to buy a part for my machine, only to die in the next round or two and have to start completely over. I haven't got to experience really gearing up my machines because I just die again after a handful of upgrades.\n\nThis game is also heavily RNG-reliant: you usually have absolutely none of the specific type of nodes you require, and an abundance of the one you don't. Desperately need energy? Your board is completely filled with repair nodes. If you manage to make it through a battle, you'll often find that you have to defeat another (previously hidden) opponent. When you inevitably lose, that just brings me back to my first point: losing to progress is bad design.\n\nOverall, the game can be quite enjoyable and fun, and I'm kind of 50/50 on recommending it, however; I will say that I do not recommend it because $12 is a bit expensive for what is essentially a glorified phone game of match 3.

Yes, there is the small/minor thing of walking a steam punk robot aka mech warrior going in and killing the enemy bot...BUT! the chance for win is more decided by the next turn of candy (aka color based gems which determine what boost for your stats you would be getting next) than plain upgrades to your mech unit. I personally think this game has crossed the boundary a tad bit for putting too much emphasis on chance than boosts/the strategy element like upgrades for your bot which you earn through your story campaign.

Unlike similar match three games that fuel a combat system (something like Puzzle Quest where matches result in instant actions), with Ironcast the matches simply provide resources used in making combat decisions.  This is what I loved about the game as it prevented it from being mindless fun and offered something more.\n\nHaving multiplayer would have been a nice touch, but there is still plenty of fun to be had in the game's sole single player mode considering the amount of randomization and the Global Progression leveling system (experience earned in each playthrough carries into a global exp bar that unlocks new perks, Ironcast, pilots, and passive boosts) which keeps things interesting even after you beat the game.  On the negative side, this type of progression system does mean the difficulty is tuned in a way that it doesn't feel meant to be completed in your first try which may turn away some players.\n\nIf you are on edge about I purchase I personally recommend it as if the game sees enough success it is likely we will see more updates and possibly even the addition of a multiplayer mode.","March 30, 2015","true","7.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

There is no way to flee from a losing battle like you can in FTL, which is frustrating.\n\nThe game is very RNG focused in loot/upgrades disribution and in battles. It's annoying when you lose what should be an easy battle because you aren't drawing the right tiles on the board. It reminds me of getting mana screwed/mana flooded in a CCG like Magic, except there are no skills/abilities in this game to help you avoid that.\n\nThe tile matching gameplay isn't as fun as in match-3-style games like puzzle quest as there are no cascades. You don't have to think hard as to your move, but actioning your plan it is pretty time consuming and tedious compared to similar games.\n\nThe game is a roguelike in that when you die you have to start again, and it starts to feel repeatitive and grindy fast. The campaign is the same every time, and there is not much variation possible in the build/tactics used by your mech.\n\nOn the plus side, the presentation of the game is good and it is bug free. The writing is pretty solid and while the storyline is light, it works well for its purpose. The setting (19th century steampunk mechs) has been done before but not that often, so its still kind of fresh.\n\nI wouldn't recommend this game. Try something like Puzzle Quest or Puzzle Kingdoms for a better strategy/tile matching game, or FTL for a more entertaining rogue-lite.\n\n","March 26, 2015","false","9.8"," 21 of 42 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","21","42","2","0"

I like puzzle quest type games, I like steam punk themes, I like mechs and I like Jules Verne type fantasy settings. Ironcast has managed to add all these various favourites of mine into a imaginative re-creation of the puzzle quest game. It has RPG and rogue type elements along with an alternative historical background. The artwork is sharp, neat and comes over as very Victorian steam punky. If you ever watched that film called the league of extraordinary gentlemen it kind of reminded me of that historical setting where the industrial revolution  meets fantasy. Its nice to see the lead characters being women as well (and posh ones at that lol).\n\nAfter a few games you pick up the mechanics fairly easily. Mastering the game however is a different matter. The puzzle quest part of the game blends in brilliantly as a means of controlling your ironcast. The fights are animated as each ironcast walks, fires and powers up shields. Your character even levels up with enough experience so you can add various perks. Collecting blueprints and scraps from your victories will also enable you to upgrade your ironcast giving multiple options to how you develop it. The sounds and music accompany the game perfectly.\n\nVery generous for them to give us 30% off on its release as I think its well worth the initial price.

Also at times I reach day 10 (boss battle) and still do not have guns or systems strong enough. Another thing is the boss herself is overpowered even after I got heaps of battle assets it still was not enough. Some creative ideas would be when a part is destroyed for you or enemies you should be able to repair but not use that part in the same turn make it more important to maintain your parts and both you and your enemy should have to charge weapons because it seems you are punished for having the first turn, other than that the game is very enjoyable however It will begin to grow stale for some players when they are forced to replay so often. (Fully aware that this is still early in release so I am anxious to see what the updates will bring.) Also another nice thing would be to put in buying parts for the mech (cosmetic) to make it really unique.","March 29, 2015","true","7.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Ironcast?", I immediately bought this game.  Fans of Puzzle Quest will feel somewhat familiar with the gameplay already, which has a mix of puzzle-RPG fights and roguelite.  It's a matching-to-fight game, except unlike Puzzle Quest, you aren't moving pieces to create rows of 3+.  Instead, you are using your mouse to typically connect the longest consecutive line/grouping of tiles.\n\nThe games are fairly short, involving you picking from 3 missions at a time, leveling and building up your pilot and ironcast to eventually fight a final boss that is slowly making his way to your base.  The first time you meet him, you will be really excited that you made it that far, then you will probably be brutally destroyed.  But as you continue to play the game, you will gain exp to raise your Global Level.  As your Global Level rises, you will unlock things like new ironcasts, new pilots, and permanent stat boosts or bonuses every time you level in-game.  As you can imagine, this makes the game slightly easier with every playthrough, encouraging many of them to complete your adventure.\n\nThe battles are also pretty involving.  You have many types of tiles to collect: ammo to shoot, power to raise your shields, speed so your ironcast has a chance to entirely dodge attacks, and repairs to repair weapons, legs, and shields that will get damaged by enemy fire.  You take turns making moves on unique boards (you play off your board, and the opponent has it's own), which is good in knowing you can set up moves and not have them stolen by your enemy.  The enemy also plays fair most of the time, so you don't feel cheated by the fact that he has a separate board that you cannot see.\n\nTL;DR  Great puzzle-fighting game.  One of the rare games I've paid full price for, but even more impressive is that I do not regret it one bit.  It will keep you entertained for hours, provided this type of game sounds fun to you.","May 15, 2015","true","7.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It's well put together with lots of intersting strategic decisions in and out of combat, and an outer loop with a decent amount of interesting content to unlock.  The campaign structure is very roguelike.  Expect to die early and often until you get the hang of the game, and then still expect to die pretty often :).\n\nIf you like roguelikes, puzzle combat games, mechs, and or steampunk, it's very likely you'll find something to like here.  If you like most or all of those things, just press the little 'Add to Cart' button right now.  The game is a hidden gem, and the developers deserve the original $15 and certianly whatever sale price it has now. :)\n\nFor (a lot) more details, keep on reading...\n\nDETALS:\n\nThe game is most similar to Puzzle Quest with a few minor nods to FTL.  You collect tiles on the board by playing a "drag-3" style game where you drag over connected tiles of the same type with are a few special tiles that do different things within that system.  You use the collected resources to power your weapons and defenses and repair your systems during the fight.  As such, it's a little less random than FTL feels like it is, but it still has the inherent randomness of a match-3 style game, and just not being able to get the tiles you need.\n\nThe gameplay itself is relatively straightforward.  There are four primary tile types: ammo, energy, coolant, and repair.  Ammo is used to fire your weapons, energy is used to power your defenses, coolant is needed for weapons and defenses, and repair is used to repair subsystems.  You get to make three drag matches every turn, and then the opponent gets a turn.  The opponent doesn't play on the same board as you (a la Puzzle Quest) but seems to be playing by a similar set of rules.  Unlike Puzzle Quest, during your turn you can use as many of your abilities as you want, as long as you can afford the resource costs.  You and your opponent take turns firing weapons at each other and powering up defenses until one of you runs out of health or you run out of turns (I think every mission has a turn limit).\n\nFiring a weapon requires a set amount of ammo and (optionally) coolant.  If you don't have enough coolant, your engine overheats causing damage to your mech (called an Ironcast).  It's a cool, thematic idea that you can choose to take the damage and hopefully land that shot that saves your life.  Defenses like shields and engines work the same way except with energy in place of ammo.  Shields reduce all incoming damage by a fixed amount while engines give a percent chance to dodge a shot entirely.  This creates a nice straightforward balance between weapons that have a low number of shots but do high damage (read: good against shields) vs. weapons that have a high number of shots that do low damage (read: good against engines).  Activating a shield or engine increases the active level of that system by one, up to a max of three.  Each turn, it falls by one, so you need to keep pulling in energy resources to keep those systems going.  Finally, repair works a little differently.  Basically spending 5 repair resources allows you to repair any subsystem a bit.  During combat, you and your enemy can target each other's individual weapons, engines, and shields to disable those systems.  Disabled weapons can't be fired, disabled shields and engines immediately fall to zero activity (no defense) and cannot be turned back on until repaired.\n\nIn addition to you equipment, you will have access to a set of active abilities that you can use.  Some of these you've seen in similar games (e.g., change one tile type to another type), others are specifically related to combat in this game (e.g., fire a salvo of missiles that hit random subsystems for a small amount of damage).  These abilities have no resource cost, but have a cooldown before they can be used again.  The first ability is tied to the ironcast you are using, but the others are acquired during the campaign as you level up.\n\nCompleting missions rewards you with scrap and blueprints, which you use between missions to upgrade your ironcast.  Scrap is the game's currency.  It is used to repair your ironcast between battles and to turn blueprints you find into parts you can actually use.  Blueprints are effectively random loot drops that you get from completeing missions with the added requirement that you need to pay scrap in order to actually use them.  Finally, scrap can be used to upgrade some basic core statistics of your ironcast like its health or the maximum amount of the different resources it can hold.\n\nAfter playing the game for a bit, I began to see that scrap is actually a very limited resource, and since there is no way to get back scrap from previous purchases you need to think very carefully about when to spend scrap and on what.  Do you really need to spend 800 scrap on that weapon that is a little better than your current one, or hold out for something better?  Is it really worth 1000 scrap to be able to hold only 1 more ammo?  Should I get that fancy new upgrade and go into this battle only partially repaired or work with the equipment I've got?  Similiar to the scrap resource in FTL, there are A LOT of options around what to do with it, and figuring out how to handle those options feels like a big part of succeeding at the game.\n\nSpeaking of FTL, the outer loop and general campaign flow are probably where FTL and Ironcast are the most similar.  Each campaign (I think there's more than one? I don't really know because I haven't been able to beat the first one) features a series of "days" leading up to final encounter against a boss (similar to FTL's flagship).  Each day you can pick from one of three missions with slightly different rewards, difficulty, and specific challenges.  The mission designs are interesting, though they all revolve around the same combat system.  In some missions, you are just tasked with destroying a certain number of enemies (usually just).  In others, you have to survive for a set number of turns against a significantly stronger enemy.  In still others, you need to collect special tiles off the board.  The mission variety isn't anything dramatic, but the slight modifications are interesting (and SHOULD affect your strategy).\n\nThe campaign also has a perma-death system similiar to FTL and other roguelikes.  If you are destroyed during a mission that's game over and you need to start over.  To remove a little bit of the sting, the experience you earned during the game contributes to a global experience level that unlocks new starting pilots and ironcasts as well as some general stat buffs like more health everytime you level up during a campaign.  Also similar to FTL and other roguelikes, the game offers pretty stiff difficulty especially if you try to take on the "challenging" missions.  Expect to die a lot.  In my four campaigns to this point I died twice on day 2 (out of 9), once on day 5, and once I got to the boss just long enough to watch my ironcast get annihilated.  If you aren't a fan of the roguelike style, this game may similarly irk you.\n\nI think that's the most important stuff.  I'm sure there are things I missed, but I guess I am really excited about the game and I didn't realize steam reviews have a character limit.  Anyway, it's great, go buy it! :)","June 6, 2015","true","12.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

My one criticism: Too much diologue prior to each mission. This might just be my own personal preference, im not so much intersted in the story as i am in the actual game, but if you are going to have alot of diologue (written diologue I might add) then at least figure out a way to have the conversations play out during the gameplay. At least theres a next button to skip through it a little quicker, but there are at least between 5 to 10 diologue boxes before every mission, so even the the fast clicking gets old, plus you are missing important story stuff. Like i said, its a minor gripe i have, i dont like a lot of reading in my games, im just lazy that way.

I thought at first the canda saga/columns esk mini game would put me off but it dosent at all.\n\nYou have Ammo, Power, Coolant and Repair guages powered by linking the icons/gems in the middle. You can collect icons three times per turn, refilling your guages and then use abilities such as firing a weapon, repairing, moving to increase dodge and shields to help tank hits. Its tactical, you can aim for specific parts of the enemy steam walkers (Ironcast) and so the gameplay that is turn based and nicely rendered is engaging. The whole very british victorian era setting and dialogue is great.\n\nTo keep it interesting you can collect scrap and get upgrades for your Ironcast, gain special abilities etc and so you dont really feel you are playing columns but a full blown game.

At the time of this review, I have put enough hours in to reach Global Rank 30 in the in-game "Global Progres" system in place so I feel I have enough time in game to not be blinded by its, admittedly fairly good, first impressions it left on me.\n\nLets start with what I personally like about the game.\nThe setting: The setting is an alternate history version of England in the late 1800s where instead of Steam being the major technological driving force of the universe, a mysterious substance known as Voltite has been discovered in France leading to Giant steampunk style  robots and tanks that the English and French are fighting each other with. This setting is Unique engough that it is a refreshing stand out among other games of this year.\n\nThe Weapon variety: there are multiple different types of weapons you can equip on your mech, from giant Lazers and tesla guns, to cannons, shotguns, missle launchers and rapid fire machine guns of projectile and energy bolt varieties.\n\nAugmentations: The dev has put quite a large amount of various items you can attach to your weapons, shields, drives and even your mech itself, either as an ability you can activate or a constant passive buff.\n\n\n\nWhat I am Indefferent about: These either have things that either have both pros and cons, or are just bland enough not to elicit any real response too, either positively or negatively.\n\nThe Mechs and Pilots: The Ironcasts, a the game calls the mechs, all 4 of them, are nice to look at but don't really do anything to stand out as being dramatically unique enough for a special mention. Each of the 4 have their own unique ability and fit better with certain pilots, who each have their own unique ability themselves.\n\nThe mission system: There are 10 days till the boss arrives and you get the choice of 3 missions a day until the boss fight. That is a total of 30 possible missions, but only 10 that you can actually play, This happes twice for a maximum of only 20 missions through the whole campaign possible. The missions boil down to a few types; Kill an enemy, collect a certain number of crates in the matching grid, survive so many turns, or kill an enemy without damaging a certain part so you can steal it for yourself. There are a few missions that are basically trading missions for either the in game currency of scrap for War Assets (which basically boil down to damage to the boss before the boss fight starts) or War assets for scrap.\n\nThe resource system/Matching system: This is the game's main feature, the center part of your screen where the majority of your actions occur. Your Ironcast Mech has 4 resources it needs and can hold, while there are 5 basic nodes/gems/square color types you can collect on the board.  Each mech can hold certain amount of 4 of the base resources, Ammo, Energy, Coolant and Repair. How much Ammo and Energy each mech can hold can vary by mech and 20 Coolant nodes and 10 Repair nodes can held by default by all Ironcasts. The capacity for each base resource can be upgraded on all Ironcasts, but here is where we start to run into problems.  Everything in the game you do in battle requires various amounts of coolant, from charging your shields, firing your weapons, increasing your speed to repairing damaged systems. The other nodes are fairly self explanatory, but if you run out of coolant, you can still do the actions but you will start taking heat damage to your mech and weapons.\n\n\n\nThe Things I dislike: Here is where the game starts to have problems I find very agititating.\n\nThe node drop rate: Remember how I said there a 5 basic types of Nodes but you only needed 4? Well the 5th is Scrap, the ingame currency you use to repair and upgrade your mech. While it is used for everything outside of battle, in the middle of a fight the scrap nodes can stop you from completing a chain and can force you to waist a collection line clearing them out of the way so you can get the chain you need to save  your life. The Nodes that drop in after you clear a set are determined by a Random Numer Generator system system that does not seem to be working right. In dozens of missions accross many, many campaigns I have seen the board fill with only 3 of the 5 node types and wound up losing the mission and ending the campaign because the nodes I needed refused to drop regardless of how many I cleared. While RNG is expected of a game like this, the lack of certain node type drops occurs often enough consistantly that this appears to be some sort of bug.\n\nAugments: While there is a good number of Augments available to the player, the actuall usefullness is largely dependant on how luck the player was in either what componants dropped for him during a mission or what the player is trying to do that run. All augments provide some benifit to be certain, but some are so marginal as to be largely irrelvant. The player gets the choice of 1 out of 3 every time the mech levels up in game and the augments avialbe to pick are random each time the player gets the choice, so luck again plays a factor in a good drop or not.\n\nScrap Earned to Scrap cost of weapons, repairs and upgrades: This is a big one. The scrap earned during the mission is largely determined by how many chains you complete, but is usually behind the cost of the next stage of upgrade available, for example, most initial equipment of mark 1 level costs 750 scrap to purchase but the first mission reward for completion is usually around 600 scrap unless the player deliberately takes as many turns as he can before finishing off their opponant. Sometimes this is easy depending on the opponents weapons and defences, as well as what he collects from his board ( which you do not see  yourself as the player) So if the player is unlucky and the nodes don't drop what he needs and the enemy does, the player takes alot of damage And the enemy usually has weapons that can hurt you no matter what you do for those first missions with starting gear. Damage that is repaired for 100 scrap for 100 hp. So luck then determines if the player can upgrade his mech after anywhere from either 2 to 5 missions, depending on what he is trying to get. This is if the game gives you designs that are better than what you started with as some mechs have base equipment that are better than some mark 2  models.\nMinor annoyance, the Dev has stated he does not want the game to be too easy and disables the players weapons for the first round of every fight while the enemy can shoot you on round one. This can create problems if the board doesn't spawn enough energy nodes for you to raise your defences enough, and this is also limited by how much energy you can hold in your mech. Wanting your game to be difficult is fine, Unavoidable damage that may be unrecoverable from is not.\nIn short, the biggest problem with the game I have is that player choice is far to often rendered irrelevant by luck. As a player you should feel like your decisions matter but far to often the game says you are going to lose no matter what you choose to do. Player choice should always matter, if not then the player will simply choose to not play at all.","April 6, 2015","false","25.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Similar to the Korean/Japanese puzzle game, "Puzzle and Dragon", Ironcast takes puzzle gaming into overcharge and adds the RPG and Meta-game contents well. Also, the game challenges players to take choices between defensive and offensive styles of play with ups and downs according to different play styles.\n\nHowever, It is sad that it lacks a bit of contents. The campaign is relatively short. 10 battles + Boss battle. Even though it is quite replayable, the battles become somewhat repetitive as time goes on.\n\nOverall, I have enjoyed the game and predict that the total game play time would last me for around 10 hours. Personally I think that $15 for this is kind of pushing it considering the contents within. If it's on sale then it's a definite purchase though!","July 31, 2015","true","5.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It wouldn't be so bad if you had more than one life (no-one thought to equip the ironcasts with ejector seats?), but as it is if the board doesn't generate the right colours then you're forced to start the whole game over no matter what tactics you use. The match three gameplay is also super shallow and unsatisfying and the  pointless arbitrary time limits are frustrating.\n\nThe game likes generating missions it's objectively impossible for your vehicle to complete - such as not damaging a particular enemy subsystem despite the fact that the ironcasts only come with weapons that damage all systems. The missions where you're asked to negiotiate with someone for resources are also frustrating since the only way to 'win' them is to find out the correct answers by trial and error.\n\nAvoid.","January 1","false","8.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","2"

Ironcast is no different, and after about 20 games, I was only able to confront the boss once, and died a glorious death "so close to beat him".\n\nIs there any winning strategy in this game ? I'm not sure. What I've learned so far, is that Defense is key to survival. If you let your guard down, you will suffer. Oh boy, yes you will. So Defense and Energy Upgrade are a must, but be wary of Energy cost, since some Defenses requires 3 Energy et other ones 4 Energy - this might not seem a lot, but when you are 1 Energy short, you pay a big price in Health, that will later transfer in Golden Bars in the workshop - those precious Bars you need to upgrade.\n\nWhat about Weapons ? Whatever your choice, you need one to be used against strong armor and little to no movement (single shot with high damage), and one against fast movement and little to no armor (multiple shots with low damage). Splash damage can be good, as long as you are not in a mission where you have to preserve any component of an enemy Ironcast - just check the splash damage is under the current opponent Defense level.\n\nOne note about Cooling. It's used for Weapons, Defense and Movement. Even if the initial reserve is fairly high, if you use them a lot, you'll be short soon, and working a machinery without Cooling is like setting yourself ablaze.\n\nOn my own, I like to play the first character (Defense and Movement bonuses) with the second Ironcast (Energy weapons) and play like a tower (almost no movement). I usually bet on upgrading Energy reserve up to 12, Defense then Weapons (same ones, but better if available) ; and on the abilities offered each time you reach a level : Cooling + Defense + Golden bars bonuses. My only weakness is that at a certain point, my weapons might not be up to the task.","April 24","true","25.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

They add to the unique nature of each run and surprise even the most veteran players. However, these surprises can usually be minimized with skillful play. Rogue Legacy can be conquered with careful platforming, and a master at The Binding of Issac has long since memorized enemy patterns and room layouts. Ironcast, a new steampunk roguelite from Dreadbit, combines procedural mission generation with the random boards of a gem matching puzzle game and then layers on turn based strategy on top of that. These elements form a huge balancing act that unfortunately leans heavily in favor of the random number generator at the cost of any truly tactical strategy.\n\nWant to know more?

The backrounds are nice but loop too often. There is a global level system that adds small amounts to the plays after it is unlocked along with the power ups for the mech and systems on board which isnt bad.\n\nYou make matches of 3 of ammo (purple) coolant (blue) energy (orange) green (repair) and yellow (scrap which is money) to allow you to fire your weapons, walk to increase your evasion, shields to increase survivability, coolant to run things and to repair your systems but not the mech itself. Other things like power nodes increase a used systems effectiveness and the link that allows you to chain more than one color together.\n\nThe first several goes were fun and came within 200 hp of killing the first boss but haven't been within 2000 hp since then which brings me to the games biggest flaws. The game depends HEAVILY on luck and that caused me to spend most try's dieing before the first boss. Most runs end several days before the boss due to  lack of coolant or energy.

Looked absolutely awesome and, for the first few games, it totally was. The art is nice, the music gets repetitive and the theme is awesome. But after a few more games, I started to realise a few things:\n\n1. This game is short. REALLY short. Compared to FTL's 9-ish zones and ~10-ish encounters per zone, you're looking at a total of less than 10 encounters in the whole game! Final boss included!! The whole game can, if you're fairly lucky, be completed in around 1.5-2 hours.\n\n2. Continuing on from 1, because the game's so short, much of the character, mech etc. development becomes essentially worthless. In a single game, there's absolutely no possibility of being able to put more than 3/4 upgrades into anything and, unless you want to play with level 1 equipment all game, it's pretty clear which areas are going to get upgrades and which will have to be ignored right from the start. In EVERY game.\n\n3. Again, unlike FTL, the number of potential encounters are seriously limited. After 4-5 games, you'll pretty much have seen every encounter that can possibly happen.\n\n4. Again, again, unlike FTL, the game seems to be designed to be impossible at the start. It's got a cross-game character development thing going on, meaning that as you play more and more games, you'll start with more HP, better stuff etc. and the balancing seems to be built around this - you'll have to play 10+ games with a 95%+ probability of losing, so that you can collect enough upgrades to have a reasonable shot at the end boss.\n\nAll in all, I'm fairly disappointed in this game. While I'm still glad I got it, even on a sale price of £7, I think it's significantly overpriced. YMMV.\n\n[edit] Two more things I'm starting to really hate:\n1 - Salvage missions require the collection of an undamaged part. If the enemy overuses his stuff and overheats (dealing damage to his parts) you auto-fail the mission. Hooray for stupid design!\n2 - Mission timers. Every single mission has a timer (max no of turns). Pull a couple of bad hands, and the mission is completely impossible, regardless of your planning, skill, equipment etc. It's the equivalent of telling a L20 character that they lost a fight with a L1 character because it was going to take them 10 seconds to kill the L1 rather than 8. Complete BS. [/edit]\n\nOverall, I'm starting to actively dislike the game, and am now playing only to complete the achievements.","March 27, 2015","false","36.8"," 12 of 27 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","12","27","0","0"

Not the case, its nigh on impossible to afford upgrades  after battling, its expensive to repair your ironcast, and you receive little monetary agin to spend on the much needed upgrades.\n\nThe cost of everything is ridiculous comapred to how much you receive.\n\nAnd f you finish a level much sooner than later, like perhaps if you finish a quick game in 2-3 turns in a 10 turn limit... well thats 7 entire turns of NOT scoring MUCH needed desperatly required scrap and experience to level up youir machine.\n\nThats really bad game design.\n\nAlso, the workshop part of the game has nothing to tell you how many weapon and energy modules you currently have , so when you think about upgrading the amount of modules for 1000, you might not be able to remember if you have 8 or already purchased 9 maximum, and theres no where to check.

Great descision in hindight. The art on this game is pretty good, it's well optimised (my 1GB RAM netbook can run it. Not well, but the fact the game works at all is more than usually happens), and the gameplay elements are simple yet complex at the same time. Sure, it's match-3, how hard is that? It's the resource management that gives a large part of the complexity, you rarely have the resources to do everything you want to, such as you can buy this weapon or this drive, not both. The global level grind and RNG bs can get annoying at times, but you level up quick enough and RNG is going to happen sometimes, you just have to get on with it.\nAfter just beating the final boss, I can say it was worth the effort and time to get there, very good finale.\nA couple points I do think need addressing though are the lack of reward for killing an enemy quickly and quiting during a mission\nWhen I have a good setup I can usually kill the enemy with 7-8 turs out of 10 left, which in the long run is a bad thing, as you loose turns where you can make more matches and get more XP. There needs to be something that rewards you with XP and perhaps sprap depeing on how many turns are left.\nThe other thing is if you need to quit during a mission, you loose everything, whereas if you quit in the hangar your progress is saved. I don't think campaign progress should be saved if you quit out in a mission, that defeats the point, but you should still earn the global XP you have up until that point, instead of it being lost.\nWow, didn't think I'd type that much, sorry for that.\nAnyway, overall, I'd give this 8.5/10, 9/10 if they fix the above issues. It's a deceivingly fun game that gave me a lot more enjoyment than I expected.","April 6, 2015","true","97.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Simple mechanics, not overly complicated, but difficult to master due to the randomn nature of the tile matching mechanic as well as the randomness of what buffs you get to choose from upon leveling. If there was a pool of buffs/upgrades and you simply chose from that pool upon leveling, it would be an entirely different game, because it's clear that there are a handful of upgrades/pilot/steamtank combos that can become very powerful. However, because you're given a random three buffs/upgrades to choose from each time you level, you can never count on a predetermined build or strategy. Do you have enough energy, should you boost speed or shields, shoot now or save the bullets - you'll ask  yourself these things time and time again (and feel the sting if you choose poorly). That, in my opinion, makes for compelling gameplay. And if you can't adapt, you'll just get mashed if you even make it to the first actual "boss" type challenge. Awesome game, and I'm not someone who particularly enjoys tile match games - but this title goes way beyond that.","April 7, 2015","true","115.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

While the game initially relies on luck over skill, a global level of experience saves and shares accross games, giving players more opportunity to grow and beat the odds more often. Once you learn the simple 3-match system, the game can be played very quickly. Victory depends on learning which moves help you control the board over relying on luck of the draw. No matter what, some games will be harder or easier based on AI choices or finding a rare weapon earlier than later in the game.\n\nWhile a lot of fun for a combat 3-match puzzler, if you're looking for a serious time sink, this won't be your game. If you want a challenging but possibly short game, or enjoy replaying games just for the puzzle style, this is worth the investment.

Still, I don't feel ripped off, I just want more. The battle mechanics actually freaking MATTER. That ALONE is enough to put Ironcast above any other puzzle RPG I've played. Every turn felt really consequential, the customization options were actually more than "this thing is better than that thing so use it duh", and it never bogged down in useless moves like the Puzzle Quest games.

I love steampunk and this game delivers perfectly. The art style and design are absolutly stunning.\n\nGameplay-wise we run into a couple of snags, and pretty big ones too. The first is my biggest one. Basically, you cant attack on your first turn. Now nothing would be wrong with that if the enemy played by the same rules. A couple of battles were made unwinnable by the enmy attacking first and knocking out my weapons and most of my hp. It didnt happen often enough to make it unfun, but enough to make me say what the hell.\n\nNext issue i have is the match three style. Bear in mind i dont particularly like this style of play enough as is, so this part of my review is a bit biased. There were a couple of times i was litterally unable to do anything because the table was straight up not giving me anything i could use. I lost those battles by the way. Again, didnt happen enough to make it unfun, but enough to make it an issue.\n\nLastly, the music. Its not the best i've ever heard, but its still pretty damn nice.\n\nOverall, i had fun, and ill probably play it some more later, when i have more time on my hands. It was worth the money i think.","April 27, 2015","true","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In reality, there's almost no strategy involved, and it's almost entirely luck based.  The level of strategy involved amounts to "Do I connect enough nodes to fill my bar, or do I connect as many as possible for extra experience and to clear the board?"  Some people might appreciate that, but I would personally prefer a bit less chance, and a bit more strategy.\n\nThis is how the game plays out:\n\nYou start out with a base level of HP and starting equipment.  You pick a pilot, and an ironcast (you are limited to just 1 at first, but more become available as you gain experience).  You play through missions, collecting better equipment for your ironcast, and gaining skills as you level.  You die.  You start all over, just a bit more powerful.  You get just a bit farther.  You die.  You start over, just a bit more powerful.  You get to the boss.  You die, you die, you die, you die, you die.  You make it past the boss, and get destroyed by a regular enemy because of terrible rng.\n\nI haven't yet made it to the point where I can consistently get past the boss (if such a point exists).  I've gotten nearly 20 hours on record now, and made it past him once.  Here are some issues I've seen.\n\n-It's too easy to get screwed by the board.  I lost a mission against an enemy that had 30 health left because I ran out of turns, not getting any ammo nodes.  I've been killed by enemies twice because of the same problem.\n\n-You can get stuck in a downward spiral where you have one bad fight, then you spend all your scrap repairing, so you can't upgrade anything.  So you get beat up bad the next fight, so you spend all your scrap repairing (if you can afford to repair completely), and you can't upgrade.  Until eventually, you can't possible win a single fight.\n\n-Evasion seems to need some tweaking.  I played 3 games back to back over the poast few days, and saw exactly one attack miss my ironcast the entire time.  This is with around 21% evasion.  At the same time, I missed frequently against enemies with 10%, and struggle to hit anything with 15% or more.  I just started a playthrough this morning, and prompty missed 3 shots in a row against the very first enemy that was at 7% evasion.\n\n-This one is expecially noticeable on the boss, because he's a longer fight.  Enemies seem to have an unbelievably easy time getting nodes they need.  They always fire twice (seems to be the max for the computer), they always have at least 2 layers of shields and 2 stacks of evasion, and they are always able to repair any and all systems I knock out, all in the same turn.  Usually, at least 1 of these is overcharged.  You can't actually see the board when it's the computers turn, but it seems far less chance based than it is for you.\n\n-The enemy can fire on the first turn.  You can't.  To be fair, the enemy only fires twice at the most (which is always), but you can fire seemingly as many times as the board allows.  This could be 5 or 6 timesper turn, or it could be 0 for multiple turns in a row.\n\nDespite these annoyances, overall, the game looks good, sounds good, feels good, and is fun.  If this is the sort of thing you're into, get it.","April 29, 2015","true","26.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Unfortunately, that's also all there is. I'm not particularly good at video games, but I finished this game easily in 6 hours. There's some aspects of roguelikes here--permadeath particularly, and a long tail through unlocks--but I only lost two pilots (and the second I lost because I kept clicking DONE when I meant to click on the targeting reticule). Both bosses fell on the first attempt. There's more unlocking to be done, but I don't feel particularly motivated to go back and play the same campaign over and over. I already chose the hardest missions whenever possible and they were quite simple.\n\nSo it's a great game, but it's also a very short game, which is disappointing seeing what kind of game this is: creating more content through weapons and enemies shouldn't have been that hard.

I just finished everything this game had to offer. I have completed 100% of the steam trophies, and this is the first time I have ever done that with any game. I am not a completionist by nature.\n\nThe game is quite fun. There's an element of luck and strategy which I found entertaining. Further, nothing is more enjoyable than totally wiping the floor with your opponent. Unfortunately, I think the game may have been too easy from the onset. The AI seems to only have a couple of tactics in its arsenal, and none of them make any sense compared to what you can do as a player. For instance, if I want to destroy an ironcast, I start by destroying his shields, then destroying his drive, then proceeding on to any weapon that would cause me problems. Enemies just choose a system at random every time they fire.\n\nAs for game length, there's not a lot of content. The story mode can be completed in under 3 hours. Not to say it's not fun, and completing the story mode is relatively difficult, but I feel like the story was truncated in order to create demand for some form of DLC addon.

Shows its low-budget nature in many places.\n\nPros:\n-Interesting (highly linear) story.\n-A twist on match-3 mechanics that is enjoyable and strategic.\n-Combat system has more depth than meets the eye and player skill MATTERS.\n-Failing to complete a run leads to unlocks which make the next run easier.\n\nCons:\n-SHORT. Starved for content and story. It takes 5-10 hours to beat if you're playing at a decent skill level.\n-Some mech/pilot combinations are a lot stronger than others\n-Random node generation CAN make or break a run at times, but not as much of a big deal as people might claim. Skill still matters more.\n-"Only" 4 pilots / 4 mechs. (This is nice considering the indie nature of the game, but in reality doesn't provide variety)\n\nI don't really like the comparison to FTL that some people (including TB) are making. Once you play through the game a few times you can tell that missions repeat themselves a lot more than they do in FTL, and there is no exploration to speak of.\n\nThe most successful way to play is to learn the harder missions and how to best equip yourself for them, and to milk out experience and scrap from easy missions by beating them as close to the final turn as possible without taking too much damage.\n\nIf you stick to game-winning principles and use a strong pilot-mech combo you shouldn't even fail the first boss theoretically unless you get horrible node generation. The second (final) boss is harder but even so you can beat it with average gear and no mech upgrades what-so-ever. The story ends as soon as the final boss is killed which is frustrating.\n\nI feel this game could've used more dev time poured into its storyline and maybe some more variety in weapons, pilots and mechs.

This is why I initially bought the game, and as it turns out it was pretty damn good!\n\nThe gameplay is tactical and challenging and this game borrows Ziggurat's best mechanic, where every time you level up you are offered a choice of three unique and special passives or abilities. The item progression is mostly just linear stats, but there are quite a few different varieties of weapons, and rare items often offer higher-than-average power with a drawback.\n\nIncluding the one you start with there are four Ironcasts and four pilots. Each Ironcast has different strengths and weaknesses (one is a beast with a lot of health, one is really good at dodging et cetera) and come with a unique ability, such as a missile battery or a temporary damage reduction. Each Pilot also gives you a passive ability. The only problem is that some of the pilot abilities are quite rubbish, and you are better off sticking with the first pilot.\n\nThe story is nothing special, really. There are some funny conversations with your superior officer, but mainly it's just "this is the reason why we are murdering this mech".\n\nPerformance should not be an issue unless your computer is literally a potato - I ran this on a dell laptop with an i3 and it ran just fine. During my entire 9 hour playthrough I have only run into two visual bugs - once the between-missions workshop became a black void, but all the menus remained so I could get out of it, and once a particularly clingy piece of equipment refused to let go of my cursor until I went into a battle.\n\nI beat the final boss after 9 hours, totalling up in the area of 10 attempts. All in all, I think the game is great for the price, and I am excitedly waiting for any DLC announcements.\n\nTL;DR - It's like Puzzle Quest, but with Steampunk Mechs, and it's pretty damn good for the price.","March 28, 2015","true","14.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There are a lot of options but not too many... just enough decisions to keep you wanting to take one more turn.  Some replayability in that the player can customize a totally different Ironcast every game, depending on the random options that come up to pick after each mission.\n\nOn the casual side of strategy/puzzle games but worth the low price for the amount of quality gameplay you get.","March 28, 2015","true","14.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There are three 'special' nodes, one allowing you to jump from one tile type to another, one being a wildcard that gives a boost to your next action and one being a 'collectible' wildcard that's a mission objective in some of the missions.\n\n- I feel like the defensive options aren't quite balanced; I keep using shields all the time, with drives only when I have plenty of spare energy and coolant.  Perhaps the latter's cost could creep down a bit more, or the dodge chance increased.\n\n+ You can set up a *very* satisfying turn, firing lots of shots and completely devastating an enemy mech or train, which feels pretty good.  The 'feel' of the actions is pleasant - relevant sound and graphical assets are excellent.\n\nAll in all, a really solid game, in my opinion.  It doesn't over-reach and focuses on polishing a smaller area, and it shows.  I'd like to see more pilots and mechs (perhaps there's more to unlock in later global levels) though.","March 28, 2015","true","39.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The gameplay is superb and the battles are all challenging, interesting and very fun. There are many ways to build your Ironcast and that impacts your overall strategy, forcing you to consider different courses of action.\n\nMy one complaint is regarding the fact that there are no individual storylines for each commander. I had a great time reading theis backstories, which made them all seem very interesting, but it was a MAJOR letdown to see that they all follow the same campaign, say the same things and react the same way to the events that happen in battle. It would have been much more interesting to see the events unfold from a different point of view, like from a french commander´s perspective for example.\n\nEither way, i still find this game very enjoyable and recommend it to all fans of puzzles, strategy and roguelikes. I hope the devs keep developing and adding more content, especially because the world they created is very interesting to explore.","March 29, 2015","true","17.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I also do not recommend this game to those who may want more depth in combat, length, or are generally frustrated with the core mechanics.\n\nTo put briefly, this game has exetremely basic mecahnics. Being essentially a match 3, they spice it up with overload and link buffs that can be matched with any color and provide a specific bonus. Nontheless, it is very very simply. This is not at all a bad thing but it can dissuade potential buyers (not saying that your natural inclination is wrong, but that if you honestly dislike or hate match 3, then be wary of purchase). Also, If you find yourself having a distaste for match three, you will not like this game if the second part of the mechanics does not 'wow' you.\n\nAs for the second part of the mechanics, the resources gained from the match three provide action and detailed analysis of how your mech interacts. Though you don't control the mech per se, you are more of dealing with possibilities, potential outcomes, and weighing risk with reward.

Only some stats are a bit different and the special powers are mostly boring and/or useless. Why can't I play a steam tank later in the game? Why not a totaly different mech? Same with the pilots who don't change the game that much.\n\n- Random gems/difficulty:\nWhile my very first playthrough was pretty successful, during most of the following ones I got f***ed by the gems appearing (e.g. no coolant/energy/ammo gems for several turns) or an supprisingly strong enemy pretty early. So most of the time I had to start over after only 2-3 Missions where in FTL you have the chance to escape every fight and still make it to the end boss most of the time (and die there).","April 4, 2015","true","20.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In addition there's a bit of Rogue's Legacy where you earn global XP for every run which gives you global unlocks, slowly making you a bit more powerful every time.\n\nThe gameplay is quite fun: you match tiles to build up your meters, and then raise your defenses and unlesh hell on your enemy!  Watching your massive cannons turn your enemy into a fiery ruin never gets old. :)\n\nOn the diffuculty of the game: there's definely strategy to be learned, but a lot depends on luck.  Not just the tiles that you get to match against, or missing your target, but also the weapons, shields and enhancements you receive.  If RNG is hating on you, then it's going to be rough.  If you get lucky, things can really go your way.  That's at least part of why some people feel this game is too easy and some feel it's too hard.

The gameplay is superb and the battles are all challenging, interesting and very fun. There are many ways to build your Ironcast and that impacts your overall strategy, forcing you to consider different courses of action.\n\nMy one complaint is regarding the fact that there are no individual storylines for each commander. I had a great time reading theis backstories, which made them all seem very interesting, but it was a MAJOR letdown to see that they all follow the same campaign, say the same things and react the same way to the events that happen in battle. It would have been much more interesting to see the events unfold from a different point of view, like from a french commander´s perspective for example.\n\nEither way, i still find this game very enjoyable and recommend it to all fans of puzzles, strategy and roguelikes.

I also do not recommend this game to those who may want more depth in combat, length, or are generally frustrated with the core mechanics.\n\nTo put briefly, this game has exetremely basic mecahnics. Being essentially a match 3, they spice it up with overload and link buffs that can be matched with any color and provide a specific bonus. Nontheless, it is very very simply. This is not at all a bad thing but it can dissuade potential buyers (not saying that your natural inclination is wrong, but that if you honestly dislike or hate match 3, then be wary of purchase). Also, If you find yourself having a distaste for match three, you will not like this game if the second part of the mechanics does not 'wow' you.\n\nAs for the second part of the mechanics, the resources gained from the match three provide action and detailed analysis of how your mech interacts. Though you don't control the mech per se, you are more of dealing with possibilities, potential outcomes, and weighing risk with reward. This gives a sense of commandering that shows a mind's ability to assess and impliment.\n\nNow this all sounds cool, in part because it is and I enjoy it, but the game's depth is not shallow as some reviews claim or deep. Instead, this game is amazing for the $10 starting price or $15 when it goes off sale regarding mechanics and replayability. Expect 10 to 20+ hours with this game, which in my book, is more than what you will get from most triple AAA titles that cast 6x-4x more.\n\nTL;DR -- Game is great, functions properly, synthesizes a combat and management, but uses a simple formula that some dislike.","March 29, 2015","true","27.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And maybe the game is a bit on the easy side... I'm not terribly good at games in general and I beat it after about 8 ½ hours (though admittedly luck was on my side on that winning run).

Though you may end up being screwed by bad luck from time to time, in the form of your attacks missing your moving adversary, ending up with a sub-optimal board and so-on, the non-random mechanics of the combat are still very much solid, allowing you to repair damaged subsystems while ensuring you have enough Coolant, Energy and Ammunition to doll out punishment and minimize your injuries.\n\nBut what of the progression system in the game? Well, at the end of each mission you acquire Scrap, Experience and War Effort, alongside system blueprints and sometimes even intact enemy systems, all of which play an important role in the battle for Great Britain. Scrap is generally used to convert blueprints into various weapons and defensive systems for your Ironcast mechanical walker, and can also be spent on increasing your health and the capacity of your resource tanks. For each War Effort point, the forces of Great Britain will be able to deal a point of damage to the massive enemy Ironcasts that serve as the game's bosses, so if you gain a great deal of War Effort before the boss fight you will stand a better chance at defeating the gargantuan interlopers that threaten Queen and Country.\n\nAs for Experience, it functions as you would expect in most RPGs in that it will drive you to level up and become even more powerful. However, rather than flat statistical increases or allowing you to progress further down a skill tree, each level grants you a Skill Point and makes you choose one out of three different Abilities or Augmentations. Excluding the Core Ability and Core Augmentation granted by your initial choice of Ironcast and Pilot, you will be able to equip three Ironcast Abilities, three General Augmentations, two Weapon Augmentations, one Shield Augmentation and one Drives Augmentation, all of which can be switched out in the Hangar to customize your Ironcast as you see fit.\n\nSpeaking of the Ironcasts and their Pilots, when you first start playing the game you have access to 1 Pilot, Lady Aeres Powell, and 1 Ironcast, the Dunraven, but later Pilots and Ironcasts will be unlocked as your Global Level increases. In the spirit of modern roguelite progression, the experience you earn during the campaign will be added up at the end, most likely when your Ironcast has been blasted to Timbuktu, and cause your Global Level to increase while unlocking new options in a linear succession. For the most part, this is a vital system for any roguelite title nowadays, as each time you play you are guaranteed to have unlocked something new when the campaign is concluded, whether it be the stalwart Sir William Beechwood, the Energy-focused Arundel-class Ironcast, new Abilities/Augmentations to be introduced to the pool, or even simply starting with more health. But while it ensures that you are always making progress, the depth of Global Levelling seems shallower than the main levelling system, in that you do not have the same element of choice when your Global Level increases.\n\nAll in all, I would say Ironcast is a jolly good show, but rather than expose you to a base and primitive numerical score to sum it up, I will instead give it "achievements" in a similar fashion to a Mr Ross Scott, citing prominent points of the game in a more concise manner.\n\n-Every Run Earns You Something\n-Rather Replayable\n-Wonderful Aesthetic\n-Good Customizability\n-Big Stompy Mechs\n-Beautifully British\n-Compelling Combat","March 29, 2015","true","33.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

As  an Ironcast pilot, you need to gather ammunition to fire at opponents, energy to drive your mech forward and power shields, coolant to prevent overheating,  repair points for your repair pool and even extra scrap for currency between missions. All of these resources are spread around a match-3 style board, and are collected by swiping through them in the usual fashion, as per this genre of game.\n\nThe catch: You can only swipe through one resource type per action you take, and you only get 3 actions per turn. Will you choose coolant to prevent overheating, or swipe some ammo and spend the ammo and what coolant you have to fire off another volley? Maybe collect repair points or energy for shields?\n\nThese decisions arise every single turn. All the while you collect XP to drive unlocks that can customize your mech, change your play style, and even help you build new weapons, shields, drives and other customizations. And in completing missions, your XP also goes toward global unlocks which will add additional content such as new perks, mechs, commanders, etc to future playthroughs.\n\nOh yeah...when you die - and you will - its game over. But dont let that discourage you.

It's an important part, of course; you're controlling a mech with four subsystems, each of which requires resources to use, and on your turn you can only make three matches to gather resources for it. Overall, both in and out of battle, you have to constantly balance costs and consequences.

I hate when puzzle and strategy games are less of puzzle and strategy and more of "click and win". Ironcast does a wonderful job of showing that every Ironcast unit is unique in its own way and have different play styles, and if you under estimate any of the Ironcast you face you could very well end up a blown up piece of scrap metal. I highly recommend this game and do hope to experience some PvP play as well as see more Ironcast units and pilots in the future! I personally give this game an 8/10 (mainly because sometimes blowing up the enemy too fast leads to a loss of exp aaand sometimes repair nodes tend to get in the way((but that adds to the difficulty so it's not an entirely bad thing just my personal hatred for the nodes themselves)) but other than that the game is great!!!)\n\nI do hope that more games like this come about and I will definitely be clocking in more hours into this Steam Punk masterpiece!\n","March 26, 2015","true","12.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But on its own terms, it is a terrific little filler that is intended to be played in short bursts and works well in that form.\nThe biggest problem of Match-3 games remains: the sheer random nature of the drops means that resource management becomes a case of crossing your fingers rather than feeling as though you are planning ahead - and this applies to the level upgrades as well.  Having said that, there is a surprising variety of approaches that seem viable, and the Global Unlock notion is a neat way of encouraging replayability whilst having to put up with the same encounters over and over (although I'm sure some new ones may well follow in time.)\nPersonally, I like the low-key graphics; they don't distract from the core gameplay but they give the right atmosphere, which is important here.  As others have noted, there are some UI issues, especially on the actual resources side, but they feel minor enough that they don't spoil things.\nIn the end, this feels a bit too much like a tablet game.

You have 2 offensive and 2 defensive systems on your mech each can have an augmentation. Your hero and your mech warrior can also have augmentations, 4 each.\n\nThe game is fairly challenging and actually it requires you to understand your opponent. You can't just go crazy and shoot without any consideration. You want to target specific sub systems of the enemy mech to make your fight easier. Sometimes ignoring hints or even direct orders from your command can cost you the mission or even the game. (Remember, it's a Roguelike, if you die, it's game over. You have to start from the beginning.)\n\nThe story is interesting and I also liked the ending. I love that fact that you have a global XP, meaning even if you die, you have gained something for your next game (a little bit of extra HP per level ups, more augmentations to choose from, new heroes or mechs, etc).\n\nThe graphics is nice, the sound is nice.\n\nOnly thing I found as a negative is the text. Sometimes I miss the voice acting, but what I mean is the dialogues are sometimes messed up. The displayed text is not checked and contains word duplication, inconsistencies (mission description says different than in the actual mission). These are just minor thing and I found only 2 or 3 of these in my the play time.\n\nIf you like mechs and gem matching and you are not scared of a roguelike and enjoy a decent challenge, this game is for you.

I like the setting. The story is original. The gameplay is smooth and fun. But I just can't get engaged in it. Why? Because whatever you plan for, hope for, try to achieve is in the end all up to the RNG.\nOne game you finally get a rare drop, but 3 games in a row not enough energy nodes to boost defenses so all money is spent on repairs and the blueprint just sits there. Another you have all the money in the world, but never see any weapon drops worth building. 5 games later you get both money and drops, but never see 3 adjacent coolant nodes and die without ever firing at the enemy.\nWhenever I actually manage to get to the first boss, I never feel it's due my own accomplishment and skill. It's 'Oh, I got lucky this time. Go me!' But then again, when you get there you see you never got any single shot weapon upgrades and can't even damage it.\nAlso whether a mission is tagged as Hard or Medium seem completely unrelated to how you fare, since it too is 100% up to what nodes spawn and when.\nIf they scripted in some guaranteed upgrades/skills/some way to give some form of control to the player, I could see myself spending a lot more time on this game.\nOther than that read Stranger1982's excellent review, it sums up the game perfectly IMO.","November 30, 2015","false","22.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I don't regret buying it, but I think it's more interesting as a view into what a game COULD DO rather than a succesful execution of itself. The game is not recieving any updates or gameplay fixes. Check the DIscussions page for many repeated grievances with this game.\n\nFor a roguelite, there's veeery little mission, equipment, or player character variety. There are, broadly speaking, only 2 different enemy types (mechs and trains) not including 2 bosses, 4 ways weapons deal damage (single-shot, multi-shot, even spread, lopsided spread), and 2 'elements' of damage (projectile and energy). There are 4 pilots and 4 mechs to choose from, but of those, there's a strong player consensus that one of them is best. So yk. ~illusion of variety and customization, ho!~\n\nThe game also goes by veeery slowly. It feels like the battle system here might have been great for a long Puzzle Quest-style campaign but was stapled to a roguelite. There are few ways to turn the tide of battle with strategic skill or weapon use once you're behind, and few times to retool your build for specific fights (money is VERY tight), so the seemingly tactical computer RPG-like gameplay mostly keeps the pace (glacial) and leaves the tactics.\n\nSo, the novelty runs out very quickly. You will not get much out of this game compared to other, similar ones at the same $15 price tag. You'd probably get more from roguelites at $10 or $5.\n\nSpecifics: The Disney Tsumo-style puzzle grid actually gives you more agency over resource collection and board manipulation than you might think. However, there board is tiny (6x6) considering the amount of different colored peices there are (5, not including gimmick pieces) and very few abilities that manipulate the board. There are way more instances of you just not being able to find resources you need versus similar games (Puzzle Quest, specifically) because you only regularly use 3/5 of the resources, 1 of them being used twice as often as the other 2, with the 2 left over being functionally worthless. It's messy.\n\nSo, I think the player consensus right now is that it's actually optimal to match as many damn pieces as you can just for the EXP bonuses because trying to control the board over the longterm is hopeless. Which sucks, because it removes what makes the constellation-match (?) gameplay interesting for a resource gathering mechanic, the control: being able to match partial sections of touching pieces that don't clear on contact.\n\nMy biggest problem with the game is that the computer doesn't operate on the same board state. So, it feels really unfair that you have to deal with a bad board, and they get to regularly perform double the actions you get to once you're hunting for coolant (the resource you need twice as much of than others). If you thought having to play around the AI getting combos or 4-matches in Puzzle Quest was bad, this is so many times worse. It'd be much fairer if they had to use the same board or their own puzzle board, but they randomly get to perform actions based on rules and math that don't apply to the player and are much more favorable to them, despite both parties acting under identical battle mechanics. There are maybe two skills out of dozens of randomly appearing ones that let you effectively interact with enemy resources. It's B.S.\n\nAll these frustrations are framed by a really sparse story about a desperate, near-impossible effort of the British to fight off an invasion of the much more technoligcally advanced French forces. But there are other, more engaging ways to reenforce that tone than by making a very elaborate, slow game of Yahtzee.","December 2, 2015","false","10.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/aistan/recommended/327670/","aistan","Lavender Gooms","http://steamcommunity.com/id/aistan/","292 products in account","This game is like a combination of Puzzle Quest and FTL. You've got inventory and leveling up, and in the gameplay there's matching game with resource management to attack/defend/use abilities. On top of this there's random missions each in-game "day", with each mission taking up that entire day and then after you complete it you move on to the next. Every mission gives you currency, experience, and blueprints you can use to purchase new equipment for your mech. After 10 days a boss shows up in London and you have to fight it.\n\nAll of that seems like it would work well, but it's all tweaked too far on the "nearly impossible" side. At the base level you have to complete missions to get stronger, but the drops after each mission are random so you could go for a while without getting a weapon or other equipment that will be enough of an upgrade to justify the significant cost to purchase it. Every time you level up the abilities it offers you to select from are random, so you could go for a while without getting any that are useful in more than the most situational of situations. The matching gameplay ends up like how it sometimes happens in Puzzle Quest, where on occasion you might end up without any gems of the resource you need and so aren't able to win not because of lack of skill, but because the RNG says "nope". And then you have to do all this preparation in 10 days. Like, imagine FTL if you had to fight the rebel mothership at the end of sector 2. That's how tight the timing has to be on everything.\n\nAfter each failed attempt you gain experience towards a global profile level that unlocks bonuses that apply to each run. These bonuses are almost entirely useless on their own, however. Things like getting an additional +5 health per level up, when the default health for your Ironcasts are in the 800s and by the end of the game enemy weapons are doing around 180 damage per hit. The only way these global bonuses would help is if many, many, many levels were grinded out to have them add up to something significant. That's not my idea of fun.\n\nYou basically need to have perfect item drops plus perfect levelups plus perfect gem configurations in order to succeed. An ideal balance for roguelikes is to have the player's skill + strategy be able to overcome most of what randomness is thrown at them. This game is too far on the random side, to the point where player skill is almost meaningless.

Because whatever you plan for, hope for, try to achieve is in the end all up to the RNG.\nOne game you finally get a rare drop, but 3 games in a row not enough energy nodes to boost defenses so all money is spent on repairs and the blueprint just sits there.

I don't regret buying it, but I think it's more interesting as a view into what a game COULD DO rather than a succesful execution of itself. The game is not recieving any updates or gameplay fixes. Check the DIscussions page for many repeated grievances with this game.\n\nFor a roguelite, there's veeery little mission, equipment, or player character variety. There are, broadly speaking, only 2 different enemy types (mechs and trains) not including 2 bosses, 4 ways weapons deal damage (single-shot, multi-shot, even spread, lopsided spread), and 2 'elements' of damage (projectile and energy). There are 4 pilots and 4 mechs to choose from, but of those, there's a strong player consensus that one of them is best. So yk. ~illusion of variety and customization, ho!~\n\nThe game also goes by veeery slowly. It feels like the battle system here might have been great for a long Puzzle Quest-style campaign but was stapled to a roguelite. There are few ways to turn the tide of battle with strategic skill or weapon use once you're behind, and few times to retool your build for specific fights (money is VERY tight), so the seemingly tactical computer RPG-like gameplay mostly keeps the pace (glacial) and leaves the tactics.\n\nSo, the novelty runs out very quickly. You will not get much out of this game compared to other, similar ones at the same $15 price tag. You'd probably get more from roguelites at $10 or $5.\n\nSpecifics: The Disney Tsumo-style puzzle grid actually gives you more agency over resource collection and board manipulation than you might think. However, there board is tiny (6x6) considering the amount of different colored peices there are (5, not including gimmick pieces) and very few abilities that manipulate the board. There are way more instances of you just not being able to find resources you need versus similar games (Puzzle Quest, specifically) because you only regularly use 3/5 of the resources, 1 of them being used twice as often as the other 2, with the 2 left over being functionally worthless. It's messy.\n\nSo, I think the player consensus right now is that it's actually optimal to match as many damn pieces as you can just for the EXP bonuses because trying to control the board over the longterm is hopeless. Which sucks, because it removes what makes the constellation-match (?) gameplay interesting for a resource gathering mechanic, the control: being able to match partial sections of touching pieces that don't clear on contact.\n\nMy biggest problem with the game is that the computer doesn't operate on the same board state. So, it feels really unfair that you have to deal with a bad board, and they get to regularly perform double the actions you get to once you're hunting for coolant (the resource you need twice as much of than others). If you thought having to play around the AI getting combos or 4-matches in Puzzle Quest was bad, this is so many times worse. It'd be much fairer if they had to use the same board or their own puzzle board, but they randomly get to perform actions based on rules and math that don't apply to the player and are much more favorable to them, despite both parties acting under identical battle mechanics. There are maybe two skills out of dozens of randomly appearing ones that let you effectively interact with enemy resources. It's B.S.\n\nAll these frustrations are framed by a really sparse story about a desperate, near-impossible effort of the British to fight off an invasion of the much more technoligcally advanced French forces. But there are other, more engaging ways to reenforce that tone than by making a very elaborate, slow game of Yahtzee.","December 2, 2015","false","10.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There will be times where you want to shoot your enemy one last time, but the only things on the board are a bunch of repair nodes or extra scrap which are generally worse than useless.\n\nCouple that with the random progression/upgrade unlocks and you end up with wildly different games. Some games I was able to cobble together high-level equipment and breeze through levels, while others I was stuck with Mk II weapons and ♥♥♥♥-tier "5% more scrap gems"-type abilities. Additionally, since you have to pay for repairs out of your upgrading budget, many missions that offer slightly higher rewards aren't worth it as you'd have to pay more to repair your Ironcast than you'd make.\n\nI will say that Ironcast attempts to fix this balance/difficulty issue with the "New Game +" feature in which you gain permanent unlocks as you continuously play (and fail) the game, but for me that road is a long and grindy one that I just don't have time for.","June 26, 2015","false","12.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game is just too much relying on RNG and there's really no strategy on computer part than plain cheating. You never know what resources the enemy has and thus can't predict his next move. You just rely on luck. Skip it.","January 26","false","26.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But can be frustrating.\n\nI've had a lot of fun with this game, I'm not big into the match 3 genre but this one had enough additional layers to keep it interesting. It does get a little frustrating when you can't win a match because you got boned by chance but it's a great game to pick up and spend 30 mins on before moving onto something a little deeper.","January 5","true","4.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The rounds rely far too heavly on good RNG early on in the game, which makes progressing well nigh impossible.  If I hadn't paid good coin for this I'd expect to see it as a free-to-play on my phone - the kind that all but forces one to engage in some lovely microtransactions in order to progress. The concept, in general, is quite charming. The execution, excreble. While I cannot be certain, I would venture to guess that the developers relyed on punishing over-randomization to cover up for poor AI design. Would not recommend.","April 28","false","5.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

These matches, the longer they grow, also grant increasing amounts of experience points that enable the selection from one of three randomly chosen abilites upon leveling. Some of these abilities are tied to particular systems (drives, shields or a particular weapon slot), while others are installed as an enhancment to the ironcast or are a buff for your ironcast commander.\n\nThis game mixes in some very rogue-lite elements by dropping various craftable system schematics that can swing your play strategy from offensive to defensive, making evasion more appealing than damage absorption, for instance, or vice-versa. Similarly, there is an overall experience measure, accumulated from play-through to play-through that allows for a global leveling system, granting various minor buffs to make future games easier.\n\nThe art is effective at creating this alternate Victorian steampunk world and the sounds and music are pleasant enough.\n\nThe  unlockable ironcast commanders are rendered with portraits, incredibly wordy backstories that make no difference in the overall campaign, each having a unique ability that can significantly change one's approach to play. Just the same, various ironcasts, each one obviously designed to match up to the abilities of a particular commander, are well rendered, each also possessing a particular quality that sets it apart from the rest of the pack.\n\nMissions are accessed from a map of southern England. Three are offered up as options to the player, drawn from a fairly limited pool of missions. Mostly they are either destroy X number of enemies in Y number of turns, or simply survive Y number of turns, perhaps while collecting crates that spawn in the Match-3 board in the center of the screen.\n\nThere is a back and forth of dialog at the beginning of each mission with a dispatching officer which lends some context to what you're doing and why, but it's irrelevant to actual gameplay and are, fortunately, skippable. The campaign itself is a two-act affair, punctuated with over-sized boss fights at the end of each act. Success in the final fight is often a function of which schematics have dropped during play and the luck of the Match-3 draw, so to speak.\n\nThere are two DLCs available for the game, but each merely contains an additional ironcast and commander. It's disappointing that new campaigns weren't added or at least more missions with more varied structures and goals. Even at a buck, I can't recommend either of the DLCs.\n\nIroncast presents a casual and entertaining adaptation of Match-3 play that allows for a strategic depth that might appeal to a more serious gamer. Adding in the attractive Victorian steampunk dystopia and the unlockables makes for a fun, budget friendly diversion.","April 30","true","48.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It runs great, bug and crash free.  I got a good 60-70 hours of play out of it before I hit max level and completed the game for the first time (I'm not the fastest gamer out there).\n\nIt has permadeath, but you can save+quit between missions (5-15 minutes) so it is still pretty casual if you don't have a lot of uninterrupted time.  There is a global level / unlock system, so you will be dying and restarting often (especially at the beginning).\n\n+Base game has 4 commanders and 4 ironcasts to give you playstyle options.  There are various weapons and skills to choose from that vary each playthrough.  The non-hard missions vary each playthrough.\n\n-The game can be a little TOO random (example: you desperately need new guns but you keep salvaging leg/shield items).  It can also seem a bit grindy with the global level and unlock system.\n\nI had a good time playing Ironcast and would recommend it to others.","May 31","true","70.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
