This game is in it's ALPHA stage and so there is limited content, bugs and glitches, and place holder material here that will be replaced with higher quality animations and sounds for example later. This is just a taste and no where near the final product!\n\nWith that said, this game is well on it's way to becoming the next great ARPG right up there with games like Diablo and Path of Exile! I backed this game during it's kickstarter and have been anxiously waiting for this Alpha. And while I know a part of me is biased because of that, I can honestly say that even without that, I'd still be just as pleased with the current product!\n\nThe current alpha seems fairly stable, is jaw dropping gorgeous, and fun to run around destroying enemies with VERY flashy spell casts! Loot system is what you would expect from an ARPG like Diablo right? Kill enemies, collect loot, equip the best in your bag, and do it again!\n\nThe story seems pretty basic from what I've seen, but it is only the beginning so I think things will get more interesting later.\n\nThe one time I had the game crash was during a "bounty" run. I'm not 100% sure but the bounty seems like it's basicaly an endless dungeon or limited dungeon that you run that gets progressively harder the farther you go. All levels randomly generated and there are boss encounters before you can pass to the next level. Fun stuff :)\n\nNow while I already know the animations for the characters are place holders, that is my only significant gripe with the game so far. I really want to see slower, better looking melee attacks. These sword swings for example are simply WAY too fast and there's no sense of weight and impact in them. Again, probably placeholder animations, but something I'm really looking forward seeing an upgrade to and I think needs to take priority sooner, rather than later.\n\nUmb...I mean Wolcen: LoM is a game ARPG fans should DEFINITELY keep their eyes on. Better yet, help support this indie developer by getting the Early Access here, and submit feedback! :D\n\nGLHF!","March 29","true","1.8"," 15 of 19 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","15","19","0","0"

The Wolcen devs are extremely transparent about what is going on behind the scenes. Not only do they consistently provide patches and community updates, they offer the community to help them build the game.\nIn it's current state Wolcen is fun for a few hours of entertainment, before you either run out of things to do or become confused with placeholders. The game is made with CryEngine and is an alpha, so expect the game to run poorly.\n\nThe game itself is fantastic, a good story, fantastic art, attention to detail.\n\nIn it's current state I would recommend buying it to support the development of the team, but not to play for very long.\nIt will be a month or two from this review where the game will be in a much better state based on how the team is handling things.\n\nEstimated release is early next year.\nPlus I'm a freak for player housing...

The game right now is closer to a tech demo. 2 updates a month sounds nice, but  I probably won't check back for at least 6 months. If the game is a pie, the state of the game is just a list of ingredients that's not even finalized. Optimization issues (to be expected), lack of tooltips, bland character progression options; it's merely a shell of game. I'm not sure what feedback they hope to get. "Complete more of your plans" would be my suggestion. There's no point in thinking about if combat is clunky, if the item stats lack depth, if there's a lack of replay value (normal ARPG concerns) when instead the focus is on whole aspects of the game not implemented. How can I report a bug that "Lightning Mastery" doesn't give me the bonus it provides if the bonus is listed as something like "@lightning_passive_ui 5%".\n\nBuying early access is bad, but I'm lucky enough for the money not to be an issue. Consider any purchase a donation towards the hope of a game in the future that you might like.

I took a few screenshots to show the graphics, and one close up to show texture quality.  Grim Dawn looks as good IMO (maxed out), so does Path of Exiles.  I wont compare Diablo 3 since its "animated" look and not going for a "realistic" approach.\n-Performance wise, I seemed to get between 60-75fps with SVOGI turned off and all other options maxed out, lot less with it turned on.  However, the game still looks good on low detail for those with lesser machines.\n\nI was just hoping for better looking graphics....\n\nObviously, performance will improve as the game progresses.\n\nInterface:Its not complete, but it shows all the necessary information and is layed out well.\n\nAction:-Fighting "feels" good, not laggy and precise.  Exactly how these games SHOULD feel in these types of games.\n\nCharacter Progression:Looks like you have an open skill system that allows you to put points wherever you want, so you are not tied into a Character Class.  I like that.  Its a bit like Path of Exile in that regard.\n\n\n\nSo early opinion:This game has potential IMO, lots of it if they do it right.  I look forward to watching it develop.  Should be a winner for Diablo fans.","March 25","true","0.6"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

They have promised Diablo meets Skyrim.\n\nHow have they done so far?\n\nThe ARPG feeling of Diablo is definitely there.  I love that.\nThe setting does feel more like Skyrim/TES.  It feels more medieval and serious.  I love that.\nThe world is absolutely gorgeous.\nThe music and sound are very atmosphereic.  I saw it rain, I saw weather change.  I don't see that in Diablo.\nThe skills seems very fun already.  The way they did lightning for example makes me feel powerful and is super fun.\nThe skill system is very relevant to play.\nMy hope is at some point we get necro/witch doctor style kills.  I love pets and pet management!\nI also hope we get Monk style gameplay!\n\nWhat is different so far than I had expected or hoped:\nThe dialog system they seem to be developing is closer to Diablo and not Skyrim.\nThe loot system is Diablo, not Skyrim.  This is quite disappinting.  I love the fast paced combat of Diablo, but I would prefer a more realistic loot system from Skyrim.  If there has to be a compromise, I'd prefer to loot stuff like teeth, pelt etc from wolves, ya know, stuff you would find on an animal, and then go to some mystery lottery vendor in the city and exchange all that stuff for random goodies.\n\nThe loot system being developed alone will make my forget they wanted to target anything from Skyrim.  This doesn't mean I won't play it, but it does mean they are drifting away from their vision, which is disappointing, because I want Skyrim + Diablo.\n\nHaving been on the business end of developing a huge game from alpha on, I understand system performance will be an issue for a while.  But, considering my video card (and gaming PC) is only 2 years old, it is more laggy on medium than I think it should be, even for an alpha.  I am sure this can and will be corrected,but for now, I have to I have to call it out.\n\nBottom line:  I like it.  I wish they would borrow more from Skyrim and make it a better balance between Skyrim and Diablo.  Love me some Diablo though.  The path they are on will be successful.","March 26","true","0.8"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","62","8","13","0","0"

Diablo 3, Path of Exile, Grim Dawn and so on... And despite this, Wolcen: Lords of Mayhem may be the one with the biggest potential !\n\nClaiming to take the best from Diablo 3 intense action, Diablo 2 athmosphere, Skyrim liberty of action and Grysis visual quality, Wolcen: Lords of Mayhem is really aiming at the top.\n\nAnd though that Wolcen: Lords of Mayhem is still in a very early alpha stage, i must say that i m already very impressed.\n\nThe first time playing Wolcen: Lords of Mayhem you ll be shocked by its incredible visual quality. Lightings, FX, textures... everything is rendered in a way more impressive fashion than in any other HnS game before. The Cryengine has outdone itself !\n\nNext you ll be surprised by how free you are to travel everywhere. There is no act I, II, III, etc with a linear path. Just go and explore the many areas of the game to discover both the game lore and places of interest. Wolcen: Lords of Mayhem has a rich story. Immerging yourself into its lore may even give you hints about secret places and treasures ! Through wandering you may find dangerous places such as dungeons taking place into caves, ancient ruins and so on. And as far as every dungeon is procedurally generated, you ll alway have new challenges exploring them.\n\nLast but not least you ll be pleased to notice that Wolcen: Lords of Mayhem gives you a total freedom over your character build. No class restriction at all. Spend your stat points as you wish. Learn every skill or focus on a couple, this is your choice. And your choices ll have consequences... Starting with your apocalyptic form ! The apocalyptic form are mutations (wings, horns, a third arm, etc) and is a unique feature of the game making all players unique in their look and powers. While you are playing at a low level, all important actions of your character ll be recorded. Based on said data, the game ll generate specific powers for your character, called apocalyptic upgrades. So, at higher levels, every player’s apocalyptic form should differ according to their story and play style.\n\nTo conclude i can't express enough how impressed i am by Wolcen: Lords of Mayhem potential. If you re a hack 'n slash lover you can't regret investing into this game ! Especially knowing that this game price ll rise the closer we ll get from its release.\n\nImportant note : as said before Wolcen: Lords of Mayhem is currently in a very early alpha stage. So many aspects of the game are missing and others are just placeholders. Take this very ealry alpha stage of the game as a proof of concept more than anything else (especially not a final product). So be warned that if you can't stand to have a game with many bugs and missing content just don't buy the game yet.","April 12","true","36.7"," 11 of 19 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","11","19","0","0"

Gameplay is very much Diablo / Grim Dawn (liking the rotating camera), but you can see what the engine is capable of and you can see how much care is already being put in. Visually, the ice, lightning and fire spells are already very pretty, and they "feel" like they are making an effect around you and are "not just" hitting an enemy. Its subtle, but it is there.\n\nGranted, rough around the edges still, but for an alpha certainly a lot more polished than other Early Access games already out there.

The devs have stated they will be pushing updates atleast twice a month from here on out so that's a major plus.\n\nWant to state one thing first. The game looks fantastic but optimation seems very poor. It's maybe 30-40% as fluid as the gameplay videos show, this i coming from an i7 4990k, gtx 980. I wholeheartidily believe the devs will step in and fix these issues. It's a true down to earth early access game. That said, buy the game to support the development of the game and to help push the genre forward. If you're looking for a fully fleshed out game with perfect optimation then wait, but i would still think it's worth it to buy and wait further the development. Look at ark, that games couldn't be ran past 10-15 fps regardless of the computer at first release and it took very many months to start breaking it towards being playable.\n\nPerformance wise, there are definitely issues. Wonky movements, slow loading, awkward transitions between zones. to name a few. Most of the animations feel like placeholders which they did state there are quite a few out there. Guess i didn't expect this many. Skill tree isn't fully implemented quite yet (Maybe like 20% or so is?)\n\nHowever, speaking strictly in an ARPG sense; this game feels very unique. It gives off a very old school D2 vibe with the atmosphere while brining it quite a few quality of life improvements into the genre. Between the skill leveling, acquisition, skill comboing with your weapons it feels very nice. Also, personal stat allocation!","March 24","true","2.4"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

Basic functions, like merchanting, item identification and player item storage, are not yet online. That said, I gave it a go anyway, and I was very pleased. If this is alpha, we have a lot to look forward to.\n\nThis game initially seems like an original diablo knock off, albeit a very nice one. It has crisp graphics, smooth motion, well rendered settings. Voices for the characters are not yet in game, and the quests only advance so far, but in short, if you've played diablo you will quickly grasp the basics of this game and want to explore.\n\nWhere the game really shines is when you start advancing in levels and power. Gone are the restrictive and often irritating talent trees of diablo. You and your abilities level independently. What does this mean? Let's say you find a spell book for lightning bolt, and you find the spell useful. You cast the spell a lot, and all of the sudden "ding!" you get a skill point to spend in that spell, without your character itself needing to level. Likewise, your character can level from simply smashing things with your weapon attack (giving you attribute points to spend), but if you didn't use any powers to kill, the spells will not level when your character does.\n\nThis quickly leads to very individualized characters. You can't start levelling a spell until you learn if from a book, which constrains the abilities you can initially use. But once you learn it, you can level it on your own. This means each character becomes a mishmash of what spells you find first, and the strengths your playstyle develops in that character.\n\nSince, as of this writing, the overall story arc does not advance, the game started to go a little stale after a few hours: kill, loot, repeat. But imagining a future of this game, with classless characters and maybe PvP, makes me more excited for this game than I was for Diablo 3. Let's hope the designers stay on their current vector and get the resources to finish this project!","April 8","true","20.8"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

The developers are hard at work fixing/adding etc. numerous things regularly. They've already got the graphics down and as you may have noticed it looks fantastic(best-looking ARPG). They are looking at popular APRGs to improve their game which is good news so you can be assured the game will not disappoint. They also listen very actively to the community, and so you can be very involved here with bug fixing and/or suggesting features. This game has great potential but still has a long way to go gameplay-wise. Since it's just been released in Early Access I expect the developers won't rest until it's the best it can be.

Which is  a very good thing IMO.\nAlot of issues have been fixed, I had a long 1 hour session the otherday and didnt get any crash, I am running the game at max settings and it is running very well.\n\nAs for the gameplay.\nI am kind of tired of the spells/skills, I want to build a Sword and Board character and i cant seem to do that as i cant seem to find any skill books that are suited for melee tankish classes, The passive skills are broken at this stage, and i dont know what they plan on doing with them later on. Also there is alot of running around in this game, though i doubt there is a chance.. i would love to see Mounts..(something sacred 1 and 2 had).\n\nSound\nwell its still a work in progress so nothing to write home about, Ambient sound is dead at the momment, I dont hear my character movement nor do i hear any monsters or any speech whatsoever, there are sound effects when i hit someone and there is the background music, other than that still needs to go a long long way.\n\nDepth.\nFor a ARPG this game feels like it has alot of depth and lack of depth at same time.\nThe character equipment system is very unique with  ability to have different shoulder armor for each shoulder and different armbands for each arm, There are a bunch of different types of weapons and the elemental damage plays a big role. The spells are varid and have a powerful feeling to them.. Yet at the same time, This all feels basic... it feels like a game ment for spellcasters rather than those who prefer in your face melee, I tend to prefer melee characters in ARPGs and this one feels very lacking at this point. Also i understand that we can build our character accourding to our gameplay, But i like having pre-determined classes that play entirely different. I want a Figher, a Paladin, Bard, Ranger, Mage, Wizard,  pre determined classes rather than same old lazy formula that titan-quest and  other games have started to adapt as of late.\nEach class should look different...that was my biggest gripe with Torchlight 2. A  bezerker should look big and muscular etc.\n\n\nUPDATE 4/7/2016\nSo a new 4.7gb patch landed today, The rate at which this game is being updated is amazing.\nThe new update has fixed alot of the issues and has added a new escape mechanic that can be used via the spacebar key and costs around 5 stamina. They also fixed some bugs regarding the character reloading, and some visual upgrades have been done aswel.\nReally i am impressed with this rate of updates :). I am glad that i decided to support this game. Do give it a go..u can always get a refund if u dont like it.\n\nThanks for taking the time to read it.","March 26","true","2.9"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

It's still to early to think about content in this game, but the most important thing in Diablo-style RPGs for me is fun from killing monsters and decent end-game content.\n\nWhat I liked:\n- Having fun killing mobs. It is a very important thing for aRPGs\n- Beautiful graphics, spells effects\n- Even tho the loading screen states that sound design is not yet finished, I really enjoyed the sound in the game even at this stage\n\nDisliked:\n- Don't really like the UI. HP and MP spheres are placed in the corners of the screen. It's too wide on 16:9 screen and you have to move your eyes to opposite corners of the screens (might be even more painful on 21:9 if the game supports them). I would like them to be closer to the center. Also dialogue boxes aren't cute in my opinion, and the text fonts don't match the game, sometimes the text goes out of the corners. I would completely reword most of UI parts tbh.\n- Builds balance is weird at the moment. I learned electrical spell (don't remember the name) and put it to right mouse button. It didn't have cd (just small manacost) and I could spam it to oneshot most of the mobs. Other spells weren't even close to the power of this spell.\n- Performance. As stated above there are some issues, but the fixes are coming soon.\n\nAlso take in mind that the game does not offer a big amount of content right now and I wasn't even able to test the whole available content due to bugs, performance and crashes issues.\n\nI believe that the devs can make this game much better, they just need time and more budget. If you like these kind of games I recommend you to buy this game to support developers and help them by reporting bugs. They seem to be active and they listen to players feedback which is a rare thing nowadays. If you expect to play finished game right now you would be disappointed. Don't be lazy, just buy a game and try to help to improve it together.","March 28","true","4.1"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","4"

I kid you not, you make 10 steps and the game stutters for 2 minutes every time. There is no text for the abillities or the weapons, just variables and code, you can't rebind keys, the options menu doesn't remember the things you selected ffs.\n\nTo be 100% honest, i backed this game on kickstarter and i don't regret it, it'll be a good game... some day.\n\nFor now i suggest staying away, at least for another year or so.","March 30","false","2.7"," 8 of 23 people (35%) found this review helpful","35","8","23","0","0"

As it stands though, the skills are very underwhelming, and dodging doesn't do anything as the mobs still manage to hit you after you've dodged away.\n\nPerformance is also off, sometimes it will run very smooth, others it will rubberband and lag to hell.

I understand that the game is in alpha and I have backed early access games before knowing full well that I will be playing an unfinished game in it's different stages, but this game is so poorly optimized that I have not been able to try it at alll. I can't get above 4-5FPS, rendering it completely unplayable and at this point a total waste of my money. I hope that this will get fixed in upcoming patches, but nothing has changed at all with the last few patches. To the credit of the devs, they do seem quite dedicated to the game and updates come out regularily but that unfortunately means nothing to me if I'm still unable to play it at all.\n\nJust so others can get an idea of wether or not their machines will be able to run it, the specs of my PC are:\n\nIntel Core i7 6700K\n32GB DDR4 RAM\n2xRadeon R9 380 graphics (4GB RAM each)\nAnd I'm running the game of of an SSD\n\nI really don't understand why I can't run this game at all when I'm able to run every AAA new release without any issues, my only thought is that it may have something to do with poor optimization for crossfire.","May 17","false","2.3"," 0 of 10 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","10","0","5"

I only got as far as the first "boss" which I only tried a few times because I didn't understand how to beat him and I got tired of walking all the way back. Here is where the game stands right now:\n\nPros:\n\nThe worlds look pretty. The skill effects are great. Has potentional once bugs are worked out.\n\nCons:\n\nThe game takes forever to load. I think I sat there for like 2 mins before I was able to get to the main screen. I also think my game froze when I tried to change the graphics settings. Once I was able to get in, the game is pretty laggy and the movement needs smoothed out still. I wish that my character moved as smoothly as it does in the videos that they put out for the game. Just turning my character around standing still it's all very choppy and not smooth like Diablo. I encountered a lot of UI bugs as well. I had to click the skill scrolls a few times to learn them. My character got stuck in a few really weird places in the map and I had to restart the game. It's sad that this game will never have multiplayer support.","May 22","false","0.6"," 0 of 12 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","12","0","1"
