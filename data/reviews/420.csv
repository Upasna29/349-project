So this is what the wait for Half Life 3 feels like.\n\nHalf Life 2 Episode Two is the sequel to Episode One and begins straight away. We find ourselves in the outskirts of City 17 as the Citadel has now opened a portal to the Combines home world and it's now up to us to find a way to the rebel base and shut down the portal once and for all.\n\nThe gameplay is identical to previous titles in the Half Life 2 games.  Overall there's not much to say here as it's basically DLC to Half Life 2.\n\nGraphics wise this game looks a tad bit better than Half Life 2 due to the range rendering, which I thought was under used in Half Life 2 Episode One. The portal coming from the citadel can be seen throughout the entire game which looks outstanding.\n\nThere is a reason this is my favorite Half Life title and that's the action sequences. This game is like a great action movie. Action scenes after action scenes after action scenes and it all ends up to one of the biggest cliffhanger endings in history of gaming. I'm not joking it actually pains me not knowing what happens next.\n\nI also love the incredible soundtrack. It's beyond kick ♥♥♥ and is one of my favorite game soundtracks of all time.\n\nIn the end Half Life 2 Episode Two is a thrilling ride and it should be played by everyone. I'm glad I finally joined the bandwagon. Now I can join the Half Life 3 waiting community.\n\nFinal Rating:\n10/10 - A must own and a must play\n\nIf you liked this review please consider giving it a thumbs up and if you disliked post in the comments what you disliked about the review.\n\nFor more reviews follow Snort's Review curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!","November 1, 2015","true","3.3"," 121 of 129 people (94%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","94","121","129","13","2"

I missed new enemies and new environments there but this episode delivered all of them. The story is interesting and it is a shame no conclusion is reached once you complete the second (and probably last) expansion to Half Life. The Source engine now runs an enhanced version and you can immediately see the better effects and more beautiful surroundings early on in the game.\n\nThis is a very decent expansion pack; I only wish there was a third and final episode that would conclude the story or perhaps leave more room for Half Life 3.","March 29, 2014","true","10.0"," 51 of 53 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","51","53","0","0"

Gordon Freeman and Alyx Vance must continue their fight, alongside the resistance, against the evil Combine. After the ever so slightly below par Episode 1, Episode 2 is a real return to form. Everything that was so good about HL2 is developed here and made even better. The narrative arc is strong, the dialogue well-written and witty, the voice acting accomplished and convincing, the environments spectacular and varied, and the mix between puzzle solving and combat just right. We meet several new enemies and some of the combat is pretty challenging, especially the final battle which is big on scale and mayhem and requires real strategy to complete. It’s a tough finale but well worth the effort. There’s so much to enjoy in the whole Half-Life series I can’t recommend these games enough.\n\n5/5","December 1, 2013","true","30.0"," 60 of 67 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","60","67","0","2"

After finding nothing and getting "I don't want to comment on this yet" from thier CEO Gabe Newell, I decided to give up. I noticed gaben with a large grin on his face as i walked away from Valve HQ it saddens me more. Then I look up as a woman asks me "Are you that guy investigating valve?". "Yes I am". She then said "I'm Gaben's old maths teacher and when looking through his old maths tests I found one question he got wrong!". "What was it?" I asked. "2+1"she said. A true look of surprise crossed my face. I looked back to where Gaben had been. He looked concerned and frightened. I began running as fast as I could back to Valve HQ. But Gaben was faster he used his long fall boots to jump straight down the stair well. He then boarded the front exits with filling cabnets using his gravity gun. I shouted at gaben to let me in but his only reply was "THESE THINGS THEY TAKE TIME!". I was to angry to give up now. I sparta kicked the door and filling cabnets down. Gaben ran for the stairs throwing a barrage of crowbars at me. I refused to stop. Chasing him up the stairs I found him in his office. In one hand he helled one of his many swords and in the other a copy of the illusive Half Life 3. "If you come a step closer I swear to god i'll destroy this and bury it where no one will find it, in a mexican land fill!". "NOOOOOOOOOOOO!" I screamed. I jumped at gabe and grabbed half life 3. However Gaben managed to stab me in the proccess. Gaben tried to grab half life 3 but I wouldnt let him. I dived out the way as Gabe charged at me. He missed and hit a wall and was knocked out. I ran as far as i could from Valve HQ as I could which was about a metre. I fell to the ground in an alley way just to the side of Valve HQ. I layed up against the wall slowly bleeding to death. "We made it Gordon" I said. but we hadn't, just then Gaben came round the corner. He kneeled down in front of me. He stroked his finger down my face "shhhhh" he exclaimed and threw an egg at me. "It will never be oger" he wispered gently to me. I began to fall unconcious as he walked away. I felt myself slipping but as I died I let out a tremendous "33333333333333333333333333333333333333333333!".

More importantly  the story was just  BADASS , there were so many amazing turn of events and the way they introduced new enemies, new wepons and stuff and funny aspects, the least i can say is i loved it\nBut i still have lots of questions in my mind.. like what happens after Alyx's father was murdered? What legendary borelli were they talking about? What ship Alyx's father asked us to destroy? To answer all these question they need to make Half-Life 3 but  according to   Gaben's  math teacher... gaben used to get sick by hearing the number 3.. so i guess Half-Life 3 is not possible but i see slight chances of Half-Life 3 in PS4's generation becuz:\n\nps4+ps3+ps2+ps1\nadd the numbers\n4+3+2+1=10\nDivide it by the number of consoles\n10/4= 2.5 round it off = 3\n\nHALF-LIFE 3 CONFIRMED!!!!","March 6, 2015","true","6.8"," 68 of 82 people (83%) found this review helpful 41 people found this review funny","83","68","82","41","34"

It is a sequel to the previous game, Half-Life 2: Episode One.\n\nHalf-Life 2: Episode Two follows up Gordon Freeman story from Half-Life 2: Episode One after the destruction of City 17. This time you're not going to play in City 17 anymore, the city is gone, and you're going to see more places in Half-Life universe and also, meet some new and more dangerous enemies.\n\nHalf-Life 2: Episode Two is another good sequel to the Half-Life series.

It was awarded as the Game of the Decade in the VGA Awards. The award was received by Gabe Newell, Valve founder.\n\nThe game takes place 20 years after the Black Mesa incident of Half Life ( The game that chaged it all ) . Gordon Freeman awakes from hibernation in City 17 and become part of the resistance to face the Combine Empire and attempt to defeat it. In the game Gordon meets Alyx Vance,  who is part of the resistance. The game is one of the pioneers in introducing a playmate .\n\nHalf Life 2 presents different enemies . The Headcrabs still produce that feeling of rejection when they attack. The action is breathtaking but it breaks , not like Call of Duty games where you shoot without breathing.\n\nThe narrative is implemented throughout the game, not with recording or notes , it is not necessary. The experience is brilliant. The Source engine allows good management of physics and the introduction of a new weapon. The gravity gun . The technology also allows open spaces in addition to traditional outdoor passageways and internal spaces .\n\nThe handling of the narrative and physics puzzles changed the way the FPS games developed from there into the future . It was a turning point in games history the same way it was the first Half Life .\n\nThe game was released for PC under Windows , required a 2 Ghz processor . 512 MB ​​of RAM , and a graphics card compatible with Direct X 8.1 . For the few resources sought at that time the graphical quality of the game was very good and ran very smoothly .\n\nThis is one of the "must play" games if one is serious about being a Gamer ,not only for its quality but also for being part of the history of video games.","November 26, 2013","true","0.1"," 74 of 98 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","74","98","0","4"

What is disappointing is why Episode Three has never been released.  Valve, we are your gamers.  We are fans of the series.  We were so hyped after we played this years back, and over time, that hype has slowly faded and much confusion replaced it.  I mean, what exactly happened?  Did developers leave the project?  Voice actors go on strike?  Did a very important voice actor pass away or go missing?\n\nI don't get why no clear answers are given.  We would understand if something went wrong that would cause major delays or a halt on the project.  We just want answers.  It's been 8 years.

The Hunter for the Combine, and the poisonous archnids.\n\nThe game also has awesome levels. The arachnid lair for example. At one point of the game, you will also get a car.

From then on it's a fight to get to safety and find Alyx's father.  With a lot of exterior battles and action, this game in the series feels very large while still maintaining the short packed with action game that an episode should be.  However, you should know that the game ends with a huge cliffhanger and that there is no sight of Half Life Episode 3 or Half Life 3 coming out in the near future.  This is rather disappointing, but at the same time has kept many a fans chomping at the bit for a new release in the series.","January 4, 2015","true","16.4"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","93","14","15","2","1"

It takes place immediately following the occurrences of Episode One, and contains somewhere between 4-5 hours of quality content depending on how you play it.\n\nEpisode Two does a great job progressing the title through every aspect when compared to Episode One, just like Episode One did in comparison to the base game. With Episode Two you will find slightly updated visuals by the way of textures and lighting, various new mechanics, and a couple of new enemies and weapon types. However, the narrative is easily what develops the most, which is at the same time the most frustrating part of this installment. Great strides were made into understanding the plot, you become more invested than ever, and then BOOM! Everything is stopped in its tracks, a huge cliff hanger occurs, and nearly a decade later there is no extension to the series. I took all the self-control I had to get this far still writing a genuinely informative review, so I'm just going to let it all out now.\n\nPersonal Rating: ♥♥♥♥ YOU VALVE (10)/10\nThe Combine gather, and now my watch begins. It shall not end until my death. I shall find no medkits, hold no ammo, father no children. I shall wear no helmets and win no glory. I shall live and die with the vortigaunts. I am the crowbar in the darkness. I am the researcher in the labs. I am the missile that burns against the Combine, the light that brings the end of their days, the siren that wakes the sleepers, the shield that guards the realms of men. I pledge my life and honor to the Lambda Watch, for this night and all the nights to come.","May 6","true","4.8"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

This game takes a different and  longer path than Episode One, but stunning and gripping nonetheless while following Gordon's adventures. Continuing straight off of Episode One, the game takes you through a tour of the more nature and abandonment parts of the Half-Life 2 universe. The graphics are enchanced greatly, and include some features and characters as well as some new enemies as well.\nThis game sadly leads off a huge cliff hanger, which leads to the development of the very late Half-Life 2: Episode Three, which will come some time in the future. Other than that, the game is absolutely great, and we will all hope the Episode Three will come as soon as possible, but in the meanwhile, we will look forward this great masterpiece of a series that came to Steam.

Let me explain. I am a total sucker for great endings (which is the main reason Portal 2 is my favorite game ever) and this one REALLY delivered. I mean, even for a series that ALWAYS ends on a cliffhanger, this is one damn big cliffhanger. The gameplay is solid, but it's a half-life game so thats a given. The new enemies were a lot of fun to fight. You will die a lot, especially on the final fight, which is a blast. But yeah, go buy it if you haven't yet.\n\n\n\n\n*SPOILER ALERT*\n\nThe reason the ending got to me is that it's something that wouldn't fly in a modern game. It's not even done in a cutscene. The fact that they decided to kill Eli, a character who's been with us since the very beginning, shows Valve's got guts.

It does distinguish itself on a number of points though.\n\nEpisode Two picks up where Episode One left off and once again tells you to save the world. Like Episode One there is very little new in this, most of the areas and encounters feel like repeats and you'll quickly become boring with the monotone gameplay.\n\nEpisode Two does jump a bar above Episode One by giving you quite a bit more story as you travel through the game and that does help keep you playing for a little while longer.\n\nIn the end however it feels too much like what has been done before and the verdict is much the same as Episode One. Get it if you want a few more hours of Half-Life 2 single-player but don't expect any more than that.

You’ve probably completed it years ago, or at least have a pretty good idea of what it is and why people like it. So I’ll just use this ‘review’ to recommend a puzzle mod for Episode 2, Research and Development. Simple, but amusing puzzles. Great slapstick humor. Looks really good. There’s plenty of combat too (lobbing things at the enemy for the most part, no actual weapons). Oh, and It’s probably worth checking out just to see Mr. Whirly in action.\n\nThe mod won’t start out of the box (thanks to the Steampipe update), but it’s easy enough to fix. Just open gameinfo.txt from ‘Steam\steamapps\sourcemods\research and development’ and replace the contents with this stuff[pastebin.com].\n\nYou can use this technique to fix many of the old HL2 mods, more information here.","December 25, 2013","true","13.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Winton_McCloud/recommended/420/","Winton_McCloud","Winton Rainford McCloud","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Winton_McCloud/","281 products in account","I am just going to say this right now. I really loved this game. This is going to be a long review as well. Just sayin'.\n\nNow, I do have reasons to say so. I personally disliked Half-Life 2, and Half-Life 2 Episode 1. Still buy them, because to get the full experience of Episode 2 you need to know not only the story, but how much the game improved.\n\nNow, the entire Half-Life 1 (classic?) series was great, while sometimes buggy. What can I say? Golden Source is golden. The gameplay was smooth, the weapons were nice and powerfull-ish, and you played as a variety of characters.\n\n(STILL BUY THIS GAME! SKIP IF YOU DON'T LIKE CRITICISM) Here is where Half-Lfe 2 comes in. Gordon Freeman in a City 17 train, waiting with the rest of the ctizens. Commence with an overly long section without even a crowbar, picking up and throwing spare junk. A little while after, you spend way too long speeding around in an airboat. Then the Gravity Gun, to pick up and throw even more spare junk, but at high speeds. A dunebuggy with suspension level ten thousand, not to mention two types of portable infinite ammo. Last but not least, the 1500 Megawatt Black Mesa Heavy Duty Super-Colliding Super Gravity Gun. One last way to run around with over 9000 HEV and the one weapon to rule them all. The NPCs in the game? "Oh, Gordon Freeman. We worship you, even though you basically caused this whole mess and only saved yourself." Barney Calhoun, the dropout hero of Blue Shift? "Headhumper. Headhumper. Hey, I finally took one down!"\n\nAll of these were fun, but too drawn-out. No offense to Valve, but the majority of gamers can learn how to use a gimmick in much less time than otherwise thought. Overall, Half-Life 2 had long expanses of nothing, but in reality some of the best  gameplay experiences I've ever had.\n\n(SERIOUSLY, STILL BUY THIS GAME! YOU, THE READER, HAVE THE POWER TO SKIP AT ANY TIME!) Half-Lide 2 Episode 1. Where do I begin? Morg- Gordon Freeman wakes up, and for some reason goes right back into the Citadel. Here he aquires the Conveniently Temporary Over-Powered Blue Zero-Point Energy Manipulator. I didn't think highly of this game from up front, remembering the whimper in which Half-Life 2 ended. From here on,  The gameplay is mostly indoors with airducts, similar to Half-Life 1. But, the story was meh. To add, Alyx's AI walked right up to every enemy, and died too often. The fights were really intense, though. All being said, the game kind of ended after about three hours and one strider.\n\nOverall verdict: intense, even difficult action, but compressed into too little time, squeezing out story.\n\nvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv\nHalf-Life 2 Episode 2. This game is EXCELLENT. If I can say this to the entirety of Steam after knocking the rest of Half-Life 2, I must mean something. Gordon now wakes up inside of the train that crashed. As the train slowly topples over, the obstacle course that you need to climb down changes. I also happen to love changing terrain, so good first impression. Now I begin to notice things. The flashlight that wore out in about ten seconds in the other games was replaced with one much more similar to Half-Life 1. Also on an individual battery, allowing you to dash for more than a few seconds. I gaze deeply into my teammate's eyes, she awkwardly turns away to avoid eye contact. Very human of her. The car is come-and-go. You can struggle through most areas either with or without the car. It lasted just as long as it was needed. and no longer. As for action, there was never a point without it. All was unique, as well. Half-Life 2 got stale, while Episode 1 was overwhelming. Episode 2 managed to get just the right mix of the two, combining into THE perfect balance. Rochelle- I mean, Alyx's AI was realistic, even to the level of the player. Then there's the Gnome. My good friend the Garden Gnome. As a display of how much Valve in the greatest compaby on this side of the universe, you get an achievement for carrying this guy through almost the whole game. While a pain as some points, I kind of grew to like the guy. The ALyx Vance mauled by a Hunter? "Don't look, Gnome. Shield thou purest of eyes." It's a showcase of how great the gameplay is. You literally could have taken ANY item throughout the entire game. Now, back on topic. The Characters were recovered to what they should have been. Barney as a security guard. Refugees as refugees. The vortigaunts actually using their green electricity bolts. The characters were essential to the rich storyline. The storyline alone could have made a movie, as it was what made me start rooting for Half-Life 3. Basically, every problem that I have found in any other Half-Life game was remedied in this one fantastic sequel.\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\n\nSeriously, just buy the game.\n\nNow.\n\nSell your house if you really have to.","January 26, 2014","true","22.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

Episode 2 has perfect level design (which was amazing in Half Life series all the time, but this time it's extraordinary), story is as amazing and breathtaking as before and the upgraded visuals pour new blood into Source's veins.

In comparison to Half Life 2 Episode One this was a breakthrough and I also believe that this game is better than Half Life 2. Within the game there were various mechanics that amaze me and have clearly been worked on for a long time. The story however is the best part of Half Life. This game had emotion that is not seen in most games and the animation with it made it even better. Each part of the game was highly detailed and it did not have any long and boring parts (well, at least for me). This game was brilliant except for the jaw-dropping cliff hanger (why VALVe, why?). This was the only part that annoys me and I still anticipate Half Life 3. Besides that the game was spectacular and I would play this game over most Action/Adventure games.","June 5, 2014","true","7.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

Alyx's ♥♥♥ is also counting if you're a certain friend of mine.\n\nThe game is starting after the crash of your train and the destruction of City 17. You're alone with Alyx in a forest and after finding an abandoned outpost, you're attacked by an enemy you've never seen before. Alyx is badly wounded and her life is at stake, only Vortigaunts can save her. And from there, you're going to a journey in a mine. And reaching the White Forest base will take time too.\n\nThis episode was released in the Orange Box, that is including Half-Life 2, Episode 1, Portal and Team Fortress 2. It was the first Half-Life on PC to have achievements, because of the release on X-box.\n\nWhile the game is short, the episode is still intense as you're meeting more Antlions (and new types too), you have to defend the outpost from them in an intense battle, a new car makes its appearance, a new combine type is also making its debut, spicing up the game but also, you're finally face to face to a real Combine. And that's scary because you can't do anything about it.\n\nThe White Forest ambush is also a good moment but the most difficult passage is White Forest defense against Striders. If they reach the base, it's game over. But with the Magnusson devices, you can quickly kill them. If you manage to make them stick, that's it.\n\nHowever, while this passage is really hard for the achievement with no building destroyed, the most annoying quest (for achievement, you're not forced to do it) is to bring the gnome to the rocket. And the gnome in your car?  Well, it's falling off every 5 seconds. So, in other words, you're going forward, stop the car, get the gnome back, restart the engine, advance, stop the car, etc... And another one that can rival that is to kill every Antlion larva in the mine (333 to crush) and some of them are well hidden.\n\nWith the cliffhanger, you'll understand why it's since 8 years that we're waiting for the Episode 3. Or Half-Life 3.","November 19, 2010","true","11.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Half-Life 2: Episode Two was developed by Valve Corporation and released late 2007.\n\n\n-Detailed breakdown review-\nStory: The story picks up, right where Half-Life 2: Episode One left off; Alyx Vance and Gordon Freeman are going to be reunited with Eli Vance and Dr. Kleiner to plan the next step in their battle against the Combine forces.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=520577049\n\nGameplay: This game returns to the more familiar setting of Half-Life 2, you aren't forced to rely solely on the Gravity gun like in most of Half-Life 2: Episode One. There is a new NPC that you encounter called “Hunters”, these are savage killing machines that are very imposing and at times down right freighting when encountered.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=520577103\n\nAchievements: There are 22 achievements on Half-Life 2: Episode Two. One third of the achievements are unlocked just by playing through the story. The rest are pretty tough and require careful planning, or a very long time running around.\nThe most noteworthy achievements in this game are: Get Some Grub (“Squish every antlion grub in Episode Two” – That took forever.), and Little Rocket Man (requiring you to Carry a Garden Gnome from the beginning of the game to nearly the end) – I have an obsession with garden gnomes because of this achievement, stay away from the precious!\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=520577080\n\nPrice: Half-Life 2: Episode Two is priced at $7.99, you're better off purchasing The Orange Box for $19.99, where you will gain all the Half-Life 2 games + Portal 1.\n\nConclusion: I think Half-Life 2: Episode One, and Half-Life 2: Episode Two, really should have been one amazing game. Separate they're short but sweet. To quickly recap, Story: Excellent. Gameplay: nearly identical to the previous games. Achievements: Getting 100% completed will take longer then Half-Life 2, or Episode One. Price: a bit high, but the orange box is an excellent deal for the whole series.\nI recommend this game to anyone who's played Half-Life 2 and Half-Life 2: Episode One. You don't want to jump into this game, you will want to play the previous games first.\nThank you for reading my review!\n\nRelated reviews\nHere's the URL to see my review for  Half-Life 2\nHere's the URL to see my review for  Half-Life 2: Episode One\nHere's the URL to see my review for Half-Life 3 ...(Pleaseeeeee Gabe Newell, my life will be complete... my Half-Life!)","September 21, 2015","true","9.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thepenguinfaggot/recommended/420/","thepenguinfaggot","Jacob","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thepenguinfaggot/","119 products in account","SPOILERS AHEAD\nContinuing the plot of Half-Life 2 and Episode One, Episode Two consists of seven chapters telling the story of Gordon Freeman and Alyx Vance's journey to a large Lambda Resistance base called White Forest. The Combine's Earth occupation forces have used the destruction of the Citadel to begin opening a massive super portal which, if allowed to reach critical size, would allow the Combine to call in reinforcements from their homeworld and destroy the Resistance. However, as explained by Dr. Kleiner's broadcast in Episode One, it has also caused a communications blackout, leaving the Combine isolated and disorganized in the meantime. In addition, Combine Advisors, some of them still unhatched from their pods, are scattered about the region after evacuating the Citadel. A crucial part of the plot is the Combine's message home, which was copied by Alyx and Gordon before making their escape, that the Combine sacrificed the Citadel to send. It contains data on the Combine portal code, which the Resistance can use to collapse the portal before it forms completely.\n\nAfter Gordon and Alyx climb out of the wreckage of the train they used to escape City 17, they proceed away from the former city on foot. At an old transmission station, the duo temporarily establish communication with Dr. Kleiner and Eli Vance, who are currently at White Forest. After an update of events at the now-destroyed Citadel, as well discovering the importance of the transmission packet copy that Alyx had made, they are cut off as Combine sweep the area, forcing them to move. At an abandoned mine, Alyx is critically wounded by a Hunter. A vortigaunt discovers them, and leads them to an underground Resistance shelter. The vortigaunts there have the power to heal Alyx; however, Gordon must first venture into the nearby antlion colony to recover the larval extract necessary for the healing procedure.\n\nGordon retrieves the extract and the vortigaunts begin to heal Alyx. While they are distracted, the G-Man is able to contact Gordon for the first time since the start of Episode One. He hints at Alyx's importance to his own long-term plans, revealing that he saved Alyx's life at Black Mesa despite objections from an unspecified third party. The G-Man then instructs an unconscious Alyx to tell her father to "prepare for unforeseen consequences."\n\nAfter Alyx has recovered, she and Gordon proceed to White Forest. They arrive before a convoy of Combine troops, despite being slowed by multiple ambushes, road blocks, and a near-death encounter with an Advisor. There, Alyx and Gordon are reunited with D0g, Dr. Kleiner, and Eli Vance. The player is also formally introduced to Dr. Arne Magnusson, another former Black Mesa scientist who is egotistical, verbose, and authoritarian. The team of scientists are preparing a rocket, which they plan to use in conjunction with the Combine portal code and the satellite array launched by Gordon in Half-Life, to close the Combine superportal.\n\nAfter Gordon fends off an initial Combine attack on the base, Alyx gives Dr. Kleiner the message from Judith Mossman which she recovered at the Citadel in Episode One. It contains footage and the current coordinates of the Borealis, an Aperture Science research vessel which, as Kleiner explains, one day suddenly vanished into thin air along with part of the surrounding drydock. Although it is not explained what technology the ship contains, Kleiner insists that it should be used to aid the Resistance effort, while Eli counters that it is impossible to control and must be destroyed. Regardless, they agree that Alyx and Gordon will travel to the Borealis and attempt to find Mossman. Alyx then unconsciously delivers the G-Man's message to her father, who is physically shaken. After having Alyx leave temporarily, Eli reveals to Gordon that it was the G-Man, whom he refers to as "our mutual friend," who provided Black Mesa with the test sample that caused the "resonance cascade" (the Black Mesa incident) in Half-Life, and whispered that same strange warning to him just as Gordon entered the test chamber. He promises to further discuss this with Gordon after the superportal is closed.\n\nWhile the rocket is being prepared, White Forest comes under attack by a dozen Striders escorted by Hunters. Gordon engages and destroys them using experimental explosive charges created by Magnusson. The rocket is successfully launched and the super portal is closed, isolating Combine forces on Earth from their homeworld. Alyx and Gordon then prepare to leave for the Borealis, at which point Eli again warns Gordon about the ship's "cargo". The three of them head into a hangar, intending to board an old helicopter which Alyx has restored. However, a pair of Advisors burst into the hangar and restrain them. Alyx and Gordon watch helplessly as Eli is killed by one of the Advisors, but as the second Advisor prepares to kill Alyx, Dog bursts in through the roof and attacks it, causing both Advisors to flee. The game fades out slowly as Alyx, sobbing, clutches her father's body.","December 12, 2015","true","10.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","3"

If you've some how never played this I'm torn between recommending this as it's great or skipping it so you won't be stuck...waiting for a resolution. In terms of pacing you'll be moving around a lot better than in Episode 1 as with one exception there aren't any places for them to lock us up while they dump exposition on us even if it is as always well written and interesting.

It was developed by Valve Corporation in tandem with Episode One, the first game in the series, and released in 2007 via Valve's Steam content distribution platform. The episode was released both separately and as a part of a bundled package, The Orange Box.\n\n\nPros :\n\n+ Second episode of Half Life 2\n+ More Half Life goodness in a nutshell\n+ Lots of exciting set pieces\n+ Tons of backstory\n+ Source engine looks amazing as usual\n+ Driving a nice car\n+ Steam achivements\n+ Crowbar is back again (awww how sweet)\n+ Emotinal ending (you must play it to see it)\n\n\nCons :\n\n- Sadly is too short :(\n- Some segments can get boring\n- A few inconsistent and poorly executed sequences\n- Still waiting for Half Life 3 (who knows meybe 1 day it will be out)\n\n\nI recommend you buy Orange Box or Half Life series to uncover full journey of Gordon Freeman, Alyx Vance and helpful rebels along challenging puzzles with Steam achievements. If you have the game and did not try it, wake up and smell the ashes because you will not be sorry to take a long journey of Half Life 2 series.","March 29, 2015","true","40.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If you're like me, and have an unsatiable lust for alpine mountain landscapes you'll enjoy Episode Two so much more. If you're not one for taking in the  sights then you'll still be impressed by the urgent sense of duty from getting to White Forest in time, well-paced levels and the heart-stopping adrenaline rush from the glorious antlion caves all lovingly topped off with the weaponry, combat mechanics and clever puzzles that made us fall in love with Half-Life. While again focusing on fleshing out the Alyx character the game also gives plenty of opportunities to get away for some Freeman action time, with and without allied vortigaunts out butt-whoopin'. What I don't like about EP2 however would have to be the final strider battle, it rushes the player in a setting of "OH CRAP-ON-A-STICK" that has the potential to ruin one's experience.

It was developed by Valve Corporation in tandem with Episode One, the first game in the series, and released in 2007 via Valve's Steam content distribution platform. The episode was released both separately and as a part of a bundled package, The Orange Box.\n\n\nPros :\n\n+ Second episode of Half Life 2\n+ More Half Life goodness in a nutshell\n+ Lots of exciting set pieces\n+ Tons of backstory\n+ Source engine looks amazing as usual\n+ Driving a nice car\n+ Steam achivements\n+ Crowbar is back again (awww how sweet)\n+ Emotinal ending (you must play it to see it)\n\n\nCons :\n\n- Sadly is too short :(\n- Some segments can get boring\n- A few inconsistent and poorly executed sequences\n- Still waiting for Half Life 3 (who knows meybe 1 day it will be out)\n\n\nI recommend you buy Orange Box or Half Life series to uncover full journey of Gordon Freeman, Alyx Vance and helpful rebels along challenging puzzles with Steam achievements. If you have the game and did not try it, wake up and smell the ashes because you will not be sorry to take a long journey of Half Life 2 series.","March 29, 2015","true","40.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There has been an error saying could not load client library... I looked it up in the forums and the forums are fulled with complaints about this error. From what the forum says, the problem is you have left something which is in Half-Life 2 Episode One. So now if anyone wants to play Half-Life 2 Episode Two they have to buy Episode One as well. I know you must be thinking why did you skip Ep One anyway.. I messed up on by buying Ep 2 instead of 1 but anyway thats not the point.

Episode 2 comes out and kicks even more ♥♥♥ than episode 1 did! It now has more story, ♥♥♥-kicking, and better graphics and physics! Valve continues making the best damn FPS ever!\n\nGraphics: So most people would think that because its using the Source engine still would like the same. Well hell no it doesn't! The updated the graphics in the game and now it looks even better than it did before! You have higher resolution textures all over the place. Improved models on some of the characters and improved textures on them. Such as the G-man who now looks ♥♥♥♥ing real. A whole new ♥♥♥♥ing particle system that improves the blood a whole punch and not to mention makes almost anything using particles a whole lot better looking. The green laser beam on the alien slaves no longer looks ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ but rather smooth and good looking. The fire is no longer just a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ sprite and is now done with particles and looks a ♥♥♥♥ing billion times better. Not to mention, Fatty McGabe put in WAY improved lighting for the whole entire game and now it has ♥♥♥♥ing soft shadows which look ♥♥♥♥ing great! I can now zoom in on alex's black/asain ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and jack off to some high resolution textures! Also the environments are now in the forest and hilly types areas with huge open outdoor environments which look ♥♥♥♥ing great. The trees look ♥♥♥♥ing amazing as well! The whole damn good looks improved big time and if you disagree then you are a ♥♥♥♥♥moking ♥♥♥♥♥♥. The art direction is excellent as always and makes the game look just awesome. Oh then there is the physics which have improved ♥♥♥♥ing ten fold! Buildings collapse and fall apart in hundreds of pieces and bridges bend and collapse. They basically just ♥♥♥♥ing improved the graphics alot. The physics still aren't good enough for Alex's face to warp when i smash her in the head with my crowbar. So the game looks damn good.\nSound: The sound again is ♥♥♥♥ING GREAT. The voice acting is top notch once again the dialog is just as good. Infact I would say the dialog was even better because its more interesting and its actually funny. Eli makes comments about how he wants you to bone his daughter and gordon is so going to do it. Hes gonna get that ♥♥♥♥♥ whether she likes or it not. He will stick his zero point gravy field manipulator inside of her. I've heard Gordon's ♥♥♥♥ is the size of a strider leg. Anyways the dialog and voice acting is top notch as always. They also updated the sounds for some of the weapons such as the pistol now has a better reloading sound. Then the music is all new and sounds ♥♥♥♥ing great. It plays right in the middle of while you are dominating some ♥♥♥♥♥es and it makes you want to ♥♥♥♥ing kill a strider then ram it in the G-mans ♥♥♥.\n\nGameplay: Holy dog ♥♥♥♥ they took an already great game and made it ten times better. So you travel through the forest to get to the main silo place at wherever and the whole way you kick ♥♥♥. You get to partner up with the vortigaunts and slaughter some stupid ant-lion aliens who deserve it. Then you kick zombie as well as solving all sorts of new physics puzzles mixed in with the action. The puzzles are also way more interesting to figure out then previously such as the balancing of the bridge so you can fly the damn car over it. You also get to kick tons of combine ♥♥♥ in the various areas you go to. Such as the house scene where you get trapped in and the house is getting shot up and you have to kick tons of ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥. Not to mention, you eventually get a car that is way better than the dunebuggy piece of ♥♥♥♥. This thing ♥♥♥♥ing flies and you can run over tons of people with it. Not to mention there is a new enemy called hunters which shoot these stupid spikes at you and then they explode. Not even they are a match for the car when i ♥♥♥♥ing floor them into a rock. The whole game just has tons of kick ♥♥♥ action sequences but none as good as the end. You drive around in your car shooter bombs at tons of striders as they lay waste to the buildings around you. It just ♥♥♥♥ing kicks ♥♥♥. The action in this game is just so damn good it makes you wonder how good episode 3 will be.\n\nStory: So the story is greatly advanced in this game with the Gman coming around telling you what to do. Eli has abunch of ♥♥♥♥ to say about whats happening and then you get to see abunch of the stupid alien blob advisors who come around. Basically the story is continued and its damn good and damn well improved. Also they make tons of references to what happened at Black Mesa and how it relates to this ♥♥♥♥. Basically the story ♥♥♥♥ing rocks and they make it even better..I won't spoil it this time though because Im such a nice guy\n\nEpisode 2 ♥♥♥♥ing rocks your face 11/10","March 9","true","1.3"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

I have not played with the new graphical mod but even without it this game has some of the most amazing looking graphics I have seen in a video game. This is partially due to its technical achievements but also due to many of the great environments we are taken to. HL2E2 has great new puzzles and is hugely important to the overall story. As I played the game I was brought to new places and met interesting people. Cool new mechanics were introduced and I was on the edge of my seat until the very end.\n\nIt is hard for me to put into words exactly how amazing this new installment in the HL series was. Know that it is one of the greatest video game experiences to date and it blows HL1 HL2 and HL2E1 out of the water,\n\n10/10 If you play one video game make sure it is Half Life 2 Episode 2.","May 14, 2015","true","5.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I dont know if this is the right place to write this but im writeing it anyway. I just want to say I have looked up to Valve for a while now. In fact I have been thinking about working for you once im finished school and University/Collage. But I am realy disapointed in what you have done in this game. There has been an error saying could not load client library... I looked it up in the forums and the forums are fulled with complaints about this error. From what the forum says, the problem is you have left something which is in Half-Life 2 Episode One. So now if anyone wants to play Half-Life 2 Episode Two they have to buy Episode One as well. I know you must be thinking why did you skip Ep One anyway.. I messed up on by buying Ep 2 instead of 1 but anyway thats not the point.

Episode 2 comes out and kicks even more ♥♥♥ than episode 1 did! It now has more story, ♥♥♥-kicking, and better graphics and physics! Valve continues making the best damn FPS ever!\n\nGraphics: So most people would think that because its using the Source engine still would like the same. Well hell no it doesn't! The updated the graphics in the game and now it looks even better than it did before! You have higher resolution textures all over the place. Improved models on some of the characters and improved textures on them. Such as the G-man who now looks ♥♥♥♥ing real. A whole new ♥♥♥♥ing particle system that improves the blood a whole punch and not to mention makes almost anything using particles a whole lot better looking. The green laser beam on the alien slaves no longer looks ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ but rather smooth and good looking. The fire is no longer just a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ sprite and is now done with particles and looks a ♥♥♥♥ing billion times better. Not to mention, Fatty McGabe put in WAY improved lighting for the whole entire game and now it has ♥♥♥♥ing soft shadows which look ♥♥♥♥ing great! I can now zoom in on alex's black/asain ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and jack off to some high resolution textures! Also the environments are now in the forest and hilly types areas with huge open outdoor environments which look ♥♥♥♥ing great. The trees look ♥♥♥♥ing amazing as well! The whole damn good looks improved big time and if you disagree then you are a ♥♥♥♥♥moking ♥♥♥♥♥♥. The art direction is excellent as always and makes the game look just awesome. Oh then there is the physics which have improved ♥♥♥♥ing ten fold! Buildings collapse and fall apart in hundreds of pieces and bridges bend and collapse. They basically just ♥♥♥♥ing improved the graphics alot. The physics still aren't good enough for Alex's face to warp when i smash her in the head with my crowbar. So the game looks damn good.\nSound: The sound again is ♥♥♥♥ING GREAT. The voice acting is top notch once again the dialog is just as good. Infact I would say the dialog was even better because its more interesting and its actually funny. Eli makes comments about how he wants you to bone his daughter and gordon is so going to do it. Hes gonna get that ♥♥♥♥♥ whether she likes or it not. He will stick his zero point gravy field manipulator inside of her. I've heard Gordon's ♥♥♥♥ is the size of a strider leg. Anyways the dialog and voice acting is top notch as always. They also updated the sounds for some of the weapons such as the pistol now has a better reloading sound. Then the music is all new and sounds ♥♥♥♥ing great. It plays right in the middle of while you are dominating some ♥♥♥♥♥es and it makes you want to ♥♥♥♥ing kill a strider then ram it in the G-mans ♥♥♥.\n\nGameplay: Holy dog ♥♥♥♥ they took an already great game and made it ten times better. So you travel through the forest to get to the main silo place at wherever and the whole way you kick ♥♥♥. You get to partner up with the vortigaunts and slaughter some stupid ant-lion aliens who deserve it. Then you kick zombie as well as solving all sorts of new physics puzzles mixed in with the action. The puzzles are also way more interesting to figure out then previously such as the balancing of the bridge so you can fly the damn car over it. You also get to kick tons of combine ♥♥♥ in the various areas you go to. Such as the house scene where you get trapped in and the house is getting shot up and you have to kick tons of ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥. Not to mention, you eventually get a car that is way better than the dunebuggy piece of ♥♥♥♥. This thing ♥♥♥♥ing flies and you can run over tons of people with it. Not to mention there is a new enemy called hunters which shoot these stupid spikes at you and then they explode. Not even they are a match for the car when i ♥♥♥♥ing floor them into a rock. The whole game just has tons of kick ♥♥♥ action sequences but none as good as the end. You drive around in your car shooter bombs at tons of striders as they lay waste to the buildings around you. It just ♥♥♥♥ing kicks ♥♥♥. The action in this game is just so damn good it makes you wonder how good episode 3 will be.\n\nStory: So the story is greatly advanced in this game with the Gman coming around telling you what to do. Eli has abunch of ♥♥♥♥ to say about whats happening and then you get to see abunch of the stupid alien blob advisors who come around. Basically the story is continued and its damn good and damn well improved. Also they make tons of references to what happened at Black Mesa and how it relates to this ♥♥♥♥.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/themanisinsane/recommended/420/","themanisinsane","TheManIsInsane","http://steamcommunity.com/id/themanisinsane/","547 products in account","Half-Life 2: Episode 2 is the direct sequel to Half-Life 2: Episode 1 and is the last Half Life game released. So I was expecting something at least semi-interesting since people have been begging for its sequel for almost 10 years now. And while I didn't come away from the ending with my jaw on the floor, agonizing over when I would be able to play its sequel, I did find it to be an enjoyable experience.\n\nThat's not to say it advances the gameplay of the Half Life series in any revolutionary way. But it does take the series' established characters and gameplay into new and interesting territory. You'll still be using the same weapons, fighting most of the same enemies, and moving around in a familiar manner, but there are some interesting new settings to advance through and some slight twists to gameplay which distinguish it enough from the rest of the games in the series, thus offering more of the satisfying gameplay the Half-Life games have been known for.\n\nThe story itself is a bit more emotionally tinged this time around. Throughout the journey you'll be to more exposed to the personal thoughts and feelings of the characters than in previous titles. And rest assured the terrffic voice work from past games is still around, and in full form, making these moments worthy of empathy, and instrumental in bringing more life to characters.\n\nGraphically there isn't much to write home about as this is a nine year old game, and it is beginning to show its age. But the Half-Life series' famous art design continues to intruige the eyes and mind so unless you're generaly abhorred by older graphics, they shouldn't dampen your enjoyment of the game. All in all, Episode 2 successfully continues to carry the torch of its predecessors and takes the Half-Life series into some interesting, albeit minimal, fresh terrain.","May 24","true","9.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The fact that we don't have HL3 or Episode Three to see the conclusion makes the ending of the game almost surreal, as we have an incomplete story.\n\nOne last thing, that damn gnome, Rufus, is just plain evil.

The story takes place outside of City 17, traveling through the surrounding forest and mines. It also introduces a few new enemies: the poison antlions and Hunters, which greatly enhances the game and makes it more challenging .\n\nThis game induces a much more lifelike feel by focusing more on the relation between Alyx and Gordon, and strengthening her role in the game. As you progress you actually CARE about what happens to her, and you find yourself becoming ATTACHED to the game, which ultimately gives the game true meaning.","August 8, 2013","true","4.7"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","7","13","0","5"

The difficulty level is higher compared to Half-Life 2 and Episode One. The graphics and voice-acting are slightly better (the minor character rebels now has their own voice instead of using the normal citizen voice).\nThe game really gives you the goosebumps unlike any other half-life 2 games (SPOILER) like the White Forest Inn ambush and the Strider Battle. And that ending really makes you want to know what is going to happen in Half-Life 3, which sadly valve won't haven't announced.................. yet.\n\nI have faith that they are working on it though! :)","June 24, 2015","true","18.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","1"

A lot more time with vortigaunts in this one, and they are pretty kick-♥♥♥ partners to have. Really, just a lot of new things in Episode Two that we haven't seen before in the series, and it's all great.\n\nPlaying and beating Half-life 2 and its episodes again just makes me want Half-life 2 Episode Three even more.

Soon you will witness TRUE HELL!!\nSo as the title may suggest, I'm supposed to be writing a review for, uhh... Half Life 2: Episo~ No no no, ♥♥♥♥ that noise!\nBut instead, I'm gonna be all edgy, stick my middle finger up, say "♥♥♥♥ the system!" and talk about a game called Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker!\nMetal Gear Solid: Peace Walker is a PSP game released in April, 2010 and continues the story of techical main protagonist and most important character of the Metal Gear Solid series Naked "Big Boss" "Jack" "Kept you waiting, huh?" Snake about 10 or so years after the events of Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater.\nThe game takes place at about the same time as the Cuban Missle Crisis, but nobody really pays attention to the real-world events that take place in and around the game, you're playing as Naked Mother♥♥♥♥ing Snake!\nAnyway, so the game was included in the Metal Gear Solid HD Collection released for the PS3 in November, 2011, bringing "Improved" graphics to the table in the form of increased texture quality. And maybe better sounds or something, I couldn't really tell you. It also improves upon the clunky-ish PSP controls by using the controls that people would be used to after playing Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty and Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater.\nThis game, is the most powerful game, IN THE WORLD! (References, ah hah!)\nThe story holds together very well, especially if you pay attention to the entirely optional cassette tapes which can be collected via various means throughout the game whether they be exploration, completion of Extra Ops (The game's version of side quests) or just progressing through the game.\nThe music in this game is another subject I'd like to talk about. There aren't many video games that come out these days with decent soundtracks anymore. Except Life is Strange and Killing Floor 2. Love those soundtracks. But this game! Damn, this game has amazing music! Koi no Yokushiryoku (Love Deterrence) is proably one of the weirdest choices for a boss fight with such meaning and importance to the game, but it fits. It fits so well! As I type up this long and pointless rant, I have that very song playing in the background. Oh, and the mission complete ditty. That thing'll play once and get stuck in your head for the rest of your life! I swear Kojima knows some legit hypnosis techniques or something.\nOh, and the game pretty much leads straight into Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes which, in turn, leads straight into Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain, which is probably THE best game ever created ever in the history of everything ever! (Yeah, ♥♥♥♥ you, Fallout 4 fans!) Which is always a plus!\nAnyway, so giant robotic AI-controlled tanks, Dianne Simmonds voicing your character's dead waifu, lesbians, obvious weeb, Japan, ROCKETU PEACE!!! and the cardboard box of love. Enjoy...\nYou're welcome...","September 17, 2015","true","10.3"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","2","5","0","0"

Valve keeps silent and refuses to tell the players anything about anything related to the sequel.\n\nFor all we know the whole saga may already be canceled, especially with the recent employee resignations.\n\nSo...play this game at your own risk knowing it will end in a massive cliffhanger and that you will get no closure for it.\n\nMight as well just play Half-Life 2 and pretend it ends there.

What makes this game stand out from the crowd is it is no where near as slow as its predecessors, and is constantly advancing the plot with it's many twists and turns. Gameplay wise, it makes no breaktrhoughs from the previous games, bar the fact it looks much sharper.\n\n10/10. Half Life 2: Episode Two is the penultimate additon to the series that it deserves.

What makes this game stand out from the crowd is it is no where near as slow as its predecessors, and is constantly advancing the plot with it's many twists and turns. Gameplay wise, it makes no breaktrhoughs from the previous games, bar the fact it looks much sharper.\n\n10/10. Half Life 2: Episode Two is the penultimate additon to the series that it deserves.

This game puts more emphasis on difficult battles in the first half, and vehicle exploration in the second half. The most memorable part has to be the finale, though I wont spoil anything.\nThis game also continues Episode One's feature of teaming up with Alyx throughout most of the game, who makes a great companion and is a proficient fighter.\nExcept this, the game is exactly like the previous two games. If you liked those games, this is more than a must-buy. If you didn't, buy it anyway. It is a great game from beginning to end (even if the plot leaves on an unresolved cliffhanger)\n\nOverall, a brilliant game for both half life fans and the first person shooter community. Definitely recommended.\nAlso, keep a tally of how many real garden gnomes you smashed when going for the Little Rocket Man achievement.

The addition of the Hunter enemy also added a lot of challenge, for me at least, which is a good thing. Makes me rather upset that Valve doesn't seem to make games anymore because they're so good at creating a cinematic experience while avoiding interupting the gameplay. They were truly the masters at what they did.\n\nAlso, ♥♥♥♥ you Magnusson your casserhole tasted like ♥♥♥♥ anyway.","February 16","true","4.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I don't know what to say about this. The ending and credits music is still leaving me depressed. Gameplay and everything was a lot better than Episode One, so that's that.\n\nThe huuuuge huge issue is, there is no sequel. There are still tons of unanswered questions that need to be thoroughly explained in this game - neither of the episodes really managed to present it well but rather added more Q than A. Actually, Episode Two was very well put with rhythmic, steady plotline if you think about it. But that can only be said if there were sequels to this game that takes the seeds of the game and expand it to maximum potential. Because this episode probably leaves you curious and dying2no a lot more than the predecessors, or even any games out there.\n\nUnfortunately, with the exception of our very last hope with the source engine 2.0, Valve will most likely not going to make any sequels to this game because there simply is no reason to.\n\nValve just doesn't realize how brutal it is to the fans who have waited literally a decade and not finish an immensely story-rich game with TONS of unanswered questions dragged alone in the back, not to mention the cliffhanger of this episode's ending as well. They're scared of causing Armageddon if the game didn't happen to be what the fans expected, but that ♥♥♥♥ didn't happen at all when they made Half Life 2. As long as they make sure they can keep the potentials of HL2 and build onto it with new engine's capabilities and whatnot, it's perfect. After all the successful sequels/remakes they've made on many great games they should feel confident at this point.\n\nIf you just want to buy this game for gunplay etc, go a head.\n\n:(","January 1","false","7.6"," 9 of 29 people (31%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","31","9","29","2","6"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Drakevarg/recommended/420/","Drakevarg","Drakevarg","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Drakevarg/","94 products in account","It took me a while to get around to reviewing this one as my aging laptop overheated about halfway through my last attempt to play it, so I had to wait until I had a more powerful one. Not docking points there - towards the end of its life that laptop even had trouble running the base HL2, which initially ran with no problems.\n\nEpisode Two is an overall stronger entry into the series than Episode One was, mostly because it had more moments actually worth remembering. All I remember about Episode One is it introduced the Zombines and the climax was a fight with a Strider in a warehouse. However, it's still a weaker product than the core game which I already thought was highly overrated.\n\nPlaying this game gave me time to analyze further what made me like HL1 so much and what made HL2 and its children fail to meet that standard. I believe there are two things HL1 did incredibly well that its sequal didn't: variety and ramping of challenge.\n\nHalf-Life's suite of challenges were extremely varied, from alien wildlife to zombies to intelligent aliens to marines to black ops ninjas to giant monsters and so forth. HL2 has Gas Mask SWAT Teams From Space, Antlions, Zombies, and Alien Vehicles. And really only that last category is even remotely interesting to fight. Not to mention the constant array of environmental obstacles Half-Life threw at you. By comparison HL2 mostly offers locked doors and the occasional pool of radioactive goo. It's easy to remember the bit with the rail cart, the bit with the tentacle monster in the silo, the bit underwater, the bit in the desert, the bit along the cliff, and so forth in HL1 than it is to remember anything in HL2 besides the ending, Ravenholm, and the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ vehicle sections.\n\nBut the focus is Episode Two, not an overall look on why HL2 doesn't work as well. Speaking of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ vehicle sections, they're back! And yes they still handle like ♥♥♥. As in a particularly energetic and unfriendly donkey ridden backwards while drunk. Fortunately they only take up about a quarter of the game, leaving another quarter for antlions, one for zombies, and one for War of the Worlds tripods.\n\nYes while Episode Two does better about being memorable than Episode One, it manages this by throwing all its weight into a handful of things. Which I can respect if done right. One of the biggest failings of sandbox games is their utter failure to focus on anything besides obsessive-compulsive garbage collecting. But that's neiher here nor there. I'm not surprised Valve went on to make Left 4 Dead after this, because they clearly think that zombie killing is the most fun thing ever since any time they turn up (which as mentiond earlier is about a quarter of the game), there are dozens upon dozens of them and the game suddenly feels like Doom in terms of just wading into bodies with the trigger held down.\n\nGoing back a moment to HL1's variety and ramping of threat, one of my bigger issues with Episode Two is the ending. Sure it's big and climactic as one might expect, but the issue is that it fails on both counts of HL1's advantages. The climactic challenge is Striders, because of course it is. They were the best part of HL2, they turned up again for the climax of Episode One, and now in Episode Two you blow up about a dozen of them in a single fight.\n\nNow, the reason this is a failure in my eyes is that the overuse of Striders as final bosses cheapens both their intimidation factor and the series ability to present a challenge. If they simply made Striders become periodic minibosses on par with the alien helicopter things it might work, as Striders become part of the greater world and a representation of our own increasing threat level. But by overusing them but still reserving them as final bosses, everyone loses. The Striders stop being intimidating because we know we can beat them, and they stop being credible as final bosses, because now we've killed 20 of the damn things and all of their wow-factor is gone, like if the final boss to a Halo game was just a dozen Hunters in a row (the fact that Halo games have never had a good boss fight is not relevant to the metaphor).\n\nTo bring this ramble to resembling a conclusion, Episode Two is not strictly speaking a bad game. Everything it does it does competently. However, I can't recommend it because it simply offers nothing to the conversation except for a cliffhanger leading into a sequel whose nonexistence has turned into an industry punchline. It shows up, it fills the space, it introduces exactly one new enemy type to wave off allegations of being blatant filler content. If you're a Half-Life fan my opinion doesn't matter because you've already bought and played it. If you aren't, skip it and find a game with more to say.","September 12, 2015","false","9.1"," 14 of 40 people (35%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","35","14","40","3","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/baron_harkonnen/recommended/420/","baron_harkonnen","Crowley","http://steamcommunity.com/id/baron_harkonnen/","17 products in account","Episode Two is an improvement over it's predecessor in many regards, but in others it ends up being worse. We've got some really good looking outdoor environments that make you want to explore everything, a real good change after so much of City 17. I thoroughly enjoyed riding the countryside.\n\nHowever this game still suffers from the fact that the episodic content idea flopped so hard. It's still just as short as it's predecessor, and it leaves the same feeling of the total lack of completion, leaving you wanting more at the end. The ending is my biggest problem. Valve seems to have resorted to cliffhanger endings to try and keep players interested in a franchise that was already aging badly. Because of this, when you get to the end, it feels so abrupt and unfulfilling, it just pisses you off. It sure as hell ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off. It's cheap bait.\n\nAnother big problem with this game is something that was present in the first episode. And this is none other than Alyx, and the way she relates with the player. Her presence in this game is even more intense, and this wouldn't be a problem if she wasn't turned into a damsel in distress. As much as Valve tried to market Alyx as a non-stereotypical female video character, she still ends up becoming one. You spend a good chunk of the game trying to save her, and this was even used before to hype players in. Her desperate "Gordon!" plea, hanging from a bridge by a piece of rebar, cements the fact that Alyx has become a Mary Sue damsel in distress. The last thing afranchise that tried to stray away from stereotypes ever needed.\nShe's one of the bigger problems with Episode Two, because her presence is always felt, her entire character and "relationship" with the player feels forced and awkward, moreso than in the preceeding game. Even Eli comments on wanting grandkids from the two of them, which raises the cringe factor through the roof. This would be less awkward if Gordon was a talking character, but in Half-Life, Gordon is really just the person who plays the game. Valve focused way too much on trying to bond Alyx with the player. It just doesn't work with a silent protagonist.\n\nStill, my Alyx rant isn't the main problem with this game. This game is just not fun to play, because at the end of it you're forever left with a cliffhanger ending that provides no resolution, no fulfillment, and no answers. It spoils anything good that the game raised during the campaign. It raises the hype and anticipation way too high, only for it to be cut short by a cheap cliffhanger ending.\n\nIn many ways, the series, beginning with Half-Life 2, feels like Damon Lindelof's stories. Valve can create interesting first and second acts, but they fail miserably on the third act. And just like Lindelof, Valve is afraid of crafting a proper third act, because if they resolved their loose ends, the weaknesses of the story would unfold.\n\nI don't recommend this game overall, it's overhyped and falls short of that hype. It's underwhelming ending, cringy sidekick and short length will leave you unsatisfied.","August 9, 2015","false","8.7"," 4 of 19 people (21%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","21","4","19","2","0"

As a note, I played the entirety of Half-Life 2 through from the beggining and am reviewing the entirety of the series here, not just Episode 2.\n\nRight out of the gate, you're on guard duty. I hate escort missions. You spend the whole game with Alyx Vance three feet behind you, causing me to wish I could shoot her, and whenever you try, you end up with much the same results as Resident Evil 4. Mainly my annoyance with Alyx came whenever I tried to move a bunch of barrels and crates to create make-shift barriers. She just gets in the way and constanltly knocks the object you're holding out of your hands. At least in Resident Evil 4 you could tell Ashley Graham to get out of your face and go hide in a steel trunk. Next, I don't understand first-person shooters that end in a final challenge which involves DRIVING (I.E. Halo & Halo 3). Finally, if you actually manage to make it past the last driving segment, you're treated to an even more poorly written end-game scenario than Blue-Shift, made even worse by the fact that it doesn't look like we'll ever get Half-Life 3, or even Episode 3.

Each copy of this game, is powered by the screaming soul of a forsaken child - or rather a forsaken gamer.\n\nThis game, and its predecessor Episode 1, is unique, in that it's not about the actual content inside the game, but the world surrounding it.\nHere's some perspective for you:\nHalf-Life was released in 1998,\nHalf-Life 2 was released 6 years later (in 2004),\nIt took six years because Valve was still a small company back then, and when it was released, it revolutionized graphics.\nSo far so good.\n\nTwo years later Valve promised us a trilogy - Half-Life 2: Episode One, Two and Three.\nHalf-Life 2: Episode One, was released 2006, and Episode Two was released in 2007, Episode Three was released in 2008.\n\n...except no, it wasn't.\nIt is now 2014, 6 years after the release of Episode Two, and still no sign of Episode Three. Valve tells us that they have largely abandoned single-player games for multi-player games.\nValve has not only forsaken their loyal gamers, but they have also exploited the attention that comes from their faithful waiting, using it to power their unholy platform Steam. They actually built a huge machine out of the torment of their faithful. This is why Steam is the number one gaming platform: Because it it lubricated with human tears, from people suckered in by Episode One and Episode Two.\n\nReaders paying attention will notice that six years passed between Half-Life and Half-Life 2. The promised that Valve sold the episodic content with, was that these episodes were going to be released *more frequently* than the bigger games. That's why we bought the games in the first place: Because we expected Valve to keep their word, and not screw us without shame.\n\nAt this point gamers are even beginning to ask themselves: Where is Half-Life 3? You set us up for the cliffhanger many years back, where another "six hour war" was impending in the story, and all we've seen, is a few leaked concept sketches and folder names to prove that you're even *leisurely* working on the game. It's been another six years, after all, and it's not like you're a small company anymore. You *are* still working on the game, aren't you?\n\nDuke Nukem Forever took 14 years, before "it was done". It undervent numerous scraps and platform changes during its time, and nobody ever thought it was worth the wait.\nHalf-Life 2: Episode Three isn't there yet, but at this rate, you might be in for that long of a wait. You might actually DIE before the "ending" to this reviewed game, continues. By finishing Episode Two, you will join the long line of The Damned. By buying this game, you will have sold your soul to Valve. I'm not even kidding.","September 14, 2014","false","9.0"," 35 of 92 people (38%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","38","35","92","18","0"

Stay away from anything Half-Life 2 related until Episode 3 or part 3 comes out. Very good games, even by today's standards (though not graphically as impressive now as back then, but ending on a cliffhanger that likely has no way of being concluded satisfactorily is every reason to skip these games.

Alyx, the NPC who has to succeed at escorting Gordon Freeman around, is as lively and personable as ever while Gordon continues to be a sack of potatos in a fancy suit because the dev team foolishly decided to take what was at least partly a technological limitation in HL and bring it over to HL2- a mute protagonist. The mechanics work well, the save system is effective and player-friendly, and there's a good amount of variety in tactics and scripted encounters that don't FEEL too scripted.\n\nSadly can't recommend due to the fact the game (er... 'episode') has a terrible ending- really, no ending at all. It's almost as if they made this game as part of a series, but that was years ago so of course that's nonsense.

I'd kind of recommend it as a continuation of Half-Life, but I'm not sure that justifies playing it. Perhaps this is a no that should be a maybe, but this game doesn't meet the high standard of its predecessors.\n\nNot many great reveals and set pieces like the Citadel fight in Half-Life 2. Scrabbling around the wilderness running from the evil authority and zombies isn't as fun or well done as some other games, including earlier Half-Life. Maybe that's why Valve is taking so long to finish up the series.
