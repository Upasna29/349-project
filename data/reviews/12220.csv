If I don't mind, how they changed their DLC's policy in GTA V which by the time steps into regular EA ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t stuff (Don't got me wrong, but Rockstar starting to make stupid Cars/Skins/Weapons DLC's but at least for free, and with my calculations, they'll fall into darkness of DLC gaming market model in few months.) Back to game ...\n\nAs I said before, oficially this game is Expansion to GTA IV, but everyone who played it, give me up toe, that this seems (and is) truly standard game. Story is gripping and longer than stories of 90% nowadays games.\nGTA IV, TBoGT (The Ballad of Gay Tony) and TLaD (The Lost and Damned) makes universe. All three stories are connected with logical connection, and what happened in GTA IV has affect on these two stories (in short EFLC)\n\nBoth expansions shows something of both worlds. TBoGT shows classy style of life and high class, besides TLaD shows underground, real side of America and true and sad side of life. I like TLaD more just because of I say in sentence before.\n\nThere's also one mission where all 3 characters meets up but now shhh about it. Also in intro, and some cutscenes. For that price you see in Store Page, you get two precise games, and they're BETTER OPTIMALIZED than GTA IV. So you don't have to worry about your hardware much as you had to in IV.\n........\n\nThe Ballad of Gay Tony - 8/10\nThe Lost and Damned - 10/10\n\nOverall expansion rating - 9/10 (Awesome)","March 1, 2014","true","21.5"," 74 of 104 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","74","104","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/XiaoXiaoMan/recommended/12220/","XiaoXiaoMan","XiaoXiaoMan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/XiaoXiaoMan/","123 products in account","The Lost and Damned\nThis episode focuses on motorcycles, as you would expect from a game that revolves around a biker gang. If GTA4 wasn't gritty enough for you, this one's even grittier. Storywise, it's about the same level of grittiness as GTA4, if not more, If you like riding bikes, you'll like this episode; Johnny Klebitz has mastered the delicate art of not flying off his bike when clipping a lamp post at 20 miles an hour. Though he's not as good of a driver as Niko, and you'll definitely notice that if and when you get behind the wheel. There's more content in general, including an exclusive set of weapons to play with, including an autopistol, a sawed-off shotgun, and a grenade launcher. You get all three of these pretty damn early in the game; the sawed-off is Johnny's starter weapon and he can fire it while riding! Worth playing if you want to follow a parallel, equally if not more gritty story to Niko's.\n\nLost MC! Lost MC!\n\n\n\nThe Ballad of Gay Tony\nThis episode takes a leap away from GTA4's usual brand of grittiness; it's more colorful, has lots of new fun guns to play with (P90 SMG, advanced sniper rifle, M249 light machine gun, AA-12 shotgun with explosive rounds...), parachutes, upgraded police units, and a whackier tone to compete with its new nemesis, Saints Row 2. This one focuses a bit more on helicopters, so this episode may be good practice for the awful PC controls for the helicopters. Or it may frustrate you a bit. Once you finish the story, you can go back and replay any mission you want. There's a score system for missions this time around, but who cares? I actually find this episode to be more fun than GTA4 just because of all the fun stuff it adds. There's nothing like screwing up everyone's commute in Star Junction with stickybombs and an explosive shotgun. What's that? The police are coming? Pfft. They ain't got ♥♥♥♥ on my APC.\n\nYou'll have a good time. And as always, mods only increase the fun.","November 19, 2014","true","38.5"," 37 of 48 people (77%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","77","37","48","5","4"

Unlike Niko however, Luis and Johnny have been in this city for a long time; they know what's going on.\n\nEpisodes from Liberty City brings you two stories, the story of Luis, The Ballad of Gay Tony, pretty self explanatory. And Johnny's story, one of the bikers in the Lost and Damned.\n\nIn my opinion, Episodes from Liberty City is a much stronger and touching story; even though it does not contain as much sad parts and engaging as Niko's storyline. Sometimes sad stories are not a free pass for a good story.\n\nIt depends on one's perspective, but to me, GTA 4 and all three of its main storyline, is based on a $2,000,000 worth of diamond(s), and the game just puts you in the shoes of one of the people who are chasing after this diamond.\n\nThe moral of the story is, we all have a dream, but someone already owns that dream. Sometimes there's people with the exact same dream as you, they're also chasing it. And if you don't make friends with them, bad things are going to happen. In the end, no one achieves that dream, because we all killed each other; but in the end, that dream is given to those who deserve it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nothingbad/recommended/12220/","nothingbad","rocketappliances","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nothingbad/","86 products in account","Copy-pasted from my IV review. This is a review of both GTA IV and EFLC.\n\nHonestly one of the best games I have ever played. Compared to V, I think there are some things that IV does better, euphoria physics, vehicle handling, story, realism in general; It's nice if that's the kind of thing you're looking for. V improved in certain areas, and included a lot of things that IV was lacking. I don't think either is better than the other, but I personally prefer IV.\n\nThe game runs OK,\nspecs:\n\nIntel Core i5-3570 3.40GHz\n8gb RAM\nAMD HD 7950 (OC)\n\nI did some tweaking and I feel like it runs best at these settings:\n\n1680x1050 60 Hz (Native)\nTexture Quality: High\nReflection Resolution: Very High\nWater Quality: Very High\nShadow Quality: High\nNight Shadows: Off\nTexture Filter: Anisotropic x8\nView Distance: 25\nDetail Distance: 40\nVehicle Density: 100\nDefinition: Off\nVSync: Off\n\nFraps Benchmark: 5 minutes, 21682 frames\nMin: 47, Max: 102, Avg: 72.23\n\nI have the latest patches on both games. Everything is vanilla except for the Visual IV Mod. If you don't have it, you might as well install it. It makes the game look a lot better and apparently includes a "fixed rendering code" to make playing smoother.\n\nI run EFLC on the same settings and results were pretty much identical. Everyone is aware that GTA IV is a ♥♥♥♥ port, but I think I've managed to get a somewhat consistent framerate. It still drops to >30 for a few seconds, occasionally. This happens no matter what I do. It's still completely playable and doesn't annoy me at all, but it's something I noticed; It's still miles ahead of the console version. If anyone is able to get a constant 60+ in this game, let me know what you are doing.\nR* Social club isn't a big deal. GFWL is useless and I don't like it, but it hasn't caused me any trouble so far. Over all, my experience with this game has been really good. The only thing that would make it better is if multiplayer wasn't dead, would've made a nice mod-friendly alternative to GTA: Online.\n\nEdit:\n\nI felt inclined to update this review after finding out a little more about the graphics settings for this game. GTA IV is not necessarily meant to be maxed out on current hardware, the intention of the developers was that the higher graphical settings would be for future use, and when GTA IV was released on PC back in 2008 there was a disclaimer of some sort that advised players to use medium settings. I'm just learning this now and I had purchased GTA IV in 2012. People are criticizing the game for being a terrible port and having framerate issues because they believe they should be able to max out a 7 year old game. In most cases they would not be wrong in assuming that, but gta iv does have higher minimum requirements than pretty much any other game. Now, with current patches, as long as you have this game configured correctly it will run beautifully.\n\nAUTO CONFIGURE IS YOUR FRIEND.\n\nUse it when you are tweaking your graphics. If you have a decent rig, most of the settings will be automatically set to high/very high, except for VD, DD, and Vehicle Density. If you want to push it further, I would increase the vehicle density, which has the lowest impact on framerate, and you will be all right leaving everything else alone. Hope this helps anyone thats having trouble running this game.","July 25, 2015","true","170.0"," 32 of 41 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","32","41","0","0"

That dagger looked good, was $7, and came in a bundle of 3 daggers for the price of one. The thief bought and opened the bundle and found that the daggers needed to be blessed since it was cursed. Games for Windows Live cursed those daggers and the thief thought of giving up since the creator of these daggers left no cure. Then he came across a blacksmith who looked promising and asked "How do I remove the curse on these daggers?" The blacksmith looked at the thief with a smile on her face and said " Here, use this water. It's called X_Liveless. It should allow you to use those daggers after you placed the water on them." The thief did as the blacksmith said to do. Several minutes later, the thief was able to wield any of the three daggers. Legend says that he who conquers the curse would be able to enjoy the use of weapons.\n\nSimply said, Rockstar should have cleaned GTA IV complete edition for Steam to sell. Don't get me wrong, I like the game. It's just that Rockstar should have made a patch, so Steam could take over instead of Games for Windows Live.","April 7","true","11.4"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","88","14","16","7","2"

Hard to believe it's been 5 years since GTA4 was released.\n\nGTA: Episodes from Liberty City (EFLC) moves the base GTA4 game forward nicely. There's two smaller storylines, each about 12-16 hours of gameplay. Both stories are interwoven with the main GTA4 storyline. Niko Bellic and other characters make appearances in these games, and certain loose ends are tied up in these episodes.\n\nThe stories are strong, the supporting characters are interesting, and the protagonists are fun to play. Luis Lopez, the main character in The Ballad of Gay Tony, is my new favorite GTA protagonist - even better than Vice City's Tommy Vercetti. These two smaller games are much more interesting to me than Niko Bellic's story.\n\nEFLC delivers some technical fixes and gameplay improvements to the base game.  Most notably, we now have mid-mission checkpoints, so if you fail a mission, you can pick up part-way through. This really decreases the frustration level of the game. Less notably, but important to me: traffic is more realistic. And, motorcycles are easier to control.\n\nThe Ballad of Gay Tony is the standout episode. It brings back the over-the-top flavor of Vice City and San Andreas. The missions are crazy fun, including a shootout on top of the Empire State Building, hijacking a subway car, helicopter duels, and a race around Manhattan -- excuse me, "Algonquin" -- involving parachutes, speedboats and fast cars. There's a new cage-fighting mini-game, and everywhere you turn in this one, there's fast cars to boost. And, as mentioned, parachuting! There's 20 optional missions involving base jumping and parachuting skills. Excellent fun. The Ballad of Gay Tony pulls out all the stops to show off what this game engine is capable of delivering. And maybe, hopefully, it shows that Rockstar hasn't forgotten how to have fun.\n\nIf you need a GTA fix before GTA V appears and you skipped these episodes, you should definitely take a second look.\n","May 14, 2013","true","32.9"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","12","13","0","0"

I could always play it in Windows 7 by putting GFWL on offline mode, but this time there doesn't seem to be an offline option.\n\nFirst of all, install "Games For Windows Marketplace" (google it, should be the first result, xbox.com page), set up an account if you don't have one. The game may automatically direct you to the download link upon trying to launch it for the first time, it did for me. You may get a prompt from Windows 10 that it's not compatible, but install it anyway. Without Games For Windows Live/Marketplace installed, the game won't launch at all.\n\nMake sure you put "-nomemrestrict -norestrictions" (without quotes of course) in the game's launch options (right click it in Steam library, select Properties). If you don't, the game won't let you change resolution or any graphics settings.\n\nFrom the main menu, pick the LIVE option and sign in. It may take a while, maybe not, but just be patient if it seems to take a while. At some point it will also ask for your game key. Don't try to close the GFWL overlay in the game while it's signing in either, I did and the whole thing became unresponsive.\n\nIt may ask you to update GFWL, I updated but it may not be necessary. If you choose to update, it will ask you to exit and re-launch the game, just sign in again from the main menu using the LIVE option. When I tried to sign in when prompted while starting a new game, it crashed. So using the LIVE option from the main menu was necessary for me. It will also download your "Profile" this may also take a bit, again just be patient.\n\nOnce you're signed into LIVE go ahead and start a new game, it should work without any problems.\n\nIt's been a while since I played this game and it was a pain to get it working this time, but so far it was worth it. I almost gave up at one point, was gonna chalk it up to the game being incompatible with Windows 10. It actually works fine under Windows 10, it's just this Games For Windows Live/Marketplace stuff that gets in the way.\n\nTL;DR\n\nTo get EFLC working in Windows 10:\n\n1) Install Games For Windows Marketplace, sign up for an account if you don't have one.\n2) Put "-nomemrestrict -norestrictions" (without quotes) in launch options for game.\n3) Launch game, set up graphics, sign into GFWL using the "LIVE" option in the main menu. It may take a while, be patient. It may ask for the game key, just put it in and it will work.\n4) Start a new game.","January 31","true","17.7"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

There is a quite significant amount of new vehicles (which reappear in GTA V), fun weapons and other minor details, like base jumping. The majority of missions involves doing rather crazy stuff, especially in comparison to the base game. In fact, to me it felt like a bridge between GTA IV and V.\nThe only thing I didn't really like was the fact that GTA IV's campaign was longer. The EFLC's ones are rather short, despite the existence of repetetive side missions.\nStill, fun-wise, TBoGT is the greatest thing since San Andreas (I'm not counting GTA V because I haven't played it yet).","June 23, 2015","true","23.2"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","12","16","0","6"

GTA4 on its own is already a great game, but it was lacking some of the older GTA things that made the series fun. The added some of that into this stand alone expansion pack. The story on both episodes is pretty solid and the missions are fun. The better of the 2 is The Ballad of Gay Tony. It is arguably better than GTA4 in all areas. The missions are more diverse and they even add some of the older GTA missions, for example there is a mission where you get to skydive. These episodes are on sale all the time so I hightly recommend them, I give these episodes a 9/10, lots of extra GTA fun.","December 29, 2013","true","34.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Play either as Johnny Klebitz, the VP of The Lost biker club, or Luis Fernando Lopez, henchman of Gay Tony, as you strive through the criminal underworld of Liberty City.\n\nPros: This is two full campaigns for Grand Theft Auto IV but doesn't require the original game to run. These are characters that crossed Niko Bellic's path in the original campaign, but their stories happen in parallel to it, allowing you to see who they were, deal with their troubles on their end, giving you a chance to understand events that happened behind the curtains of crimes Niko was involved in. Both are full-fledged story lines of their own, with its own lot of unique characters you come across and gameplay elements. Your new friends brings new perks of their own, and new locations.\n\nCons: You don't have the same feeling of discovery in this game as it's the one as Grand Theft Auto IV, with some locations or stores no longer available. You have a lot less mini-games and side quests, and much if the character customization is gone. There is no major change to the city.\n\nVerdict: ★★★☆☆ - It's up to you\n\nIt's more of the same, so it's all up to you. If you didn't enjoy Grand Theft Auto IV that much, there is no reason to buy this. However, if you did like GTA4 and wished you could play more campaign mode in Liberty City, these will deliver!\n\n—————————————————————————\nThis was just my opinion.\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up, and feel free to check out more of my (purely opinionated) reviews.","March 17, 2015","true","22.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bUbir/recommended/12220/","bUbir","bUbir","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bUbir/","97 products in account","GTA: Episodes from Liberty City is an expandalone (Standalone Expansion Pack) of GTA IV. They are a two-in-one game, with two sides of one story.\n\nOn one hand you have The Lost biker gang having gang and family issues, and on the other hand you are Luis Lopez, a part-time bodyguard at Maisonette 9, one of the biggest nightclubs in Liberty City.\n\nI will be covering The Ballad of Gay Tony first, as I found it most enjoyable.\n\nTBoGT has the most enjoyable missions in any GTA game ever, in my opinion. They are all action packed, interesting and never some sort of escort mission, or "drive there and come back" type of mission. If you've ever played GTA:SA then think of the mission where you board the cargo plane, "Stowaway". Now, multiply that mission about 30 times and you have TBoGT in a nutshell.\n\nYou get to own interesting and very fun weapons and vehicles such as huge capacity machineguns and... actually I won't spoil any more, I will just say that you will have fun, GUARANTEED, if you have one of those weapons equipped, or you are driving/piloting any of the special, new vehicles. Most of the new vehicles, if not all of them have been copy and pasted into GTA V, as they were too much fun!\n\nThe story of TBoGT is a bit lacking, but it's enough there to keep you going. The characters in the story, though, are the most crazy and insane in any GTA game ever! There is not one main story cutscene that doesn't involve someone really high on drugs, half-naked or drunk as ♥♥♥♥. You just can't hold in a laugh every time a cutscene rolls!\n\nBuuut, here comes the sad and disappointing part of the pack... The Lost and Damned.\n\nNow, this might be a bit of a swayed opinion, but The Lost and Damned was just too boring for me. The first initial missions involve you riding with your gang, informing the player about who is who. The leader of the gang just got out of jail and you are picking up his custom bike from the shop. That's the intro, really, and it's a boring, long intro of just driving. The dialogue kinda made up for it, as it was semi-interesting. It is nice to hear the bikers talk to each other when they are in proximity.\n\nYou still get some extra weapons that you don't get to use in TBoGT, and even some vehicles, but nothing really stands out. There's a sawed-off double barrel shotgun that is incredibly useful at knocking off enemy bikers, as it only needs one pellet to do so, but it's inaccurate as hell and requires you to be at point blank range. I find melee to be more fun at that time. TBoGT has set the bar for that sort of stuff, and TLaD is nowhere near reaching it.\n\nIf you really enjoyed GTA IV's narrative and atmosphere, you might enjoy TLaD because it is much more slow and story-driven.\n\nIn the end, it's weird that it was packaged with a much more "mindless fun" type of game as TBoGT.\n\nI will rate both parts of the expansions separately, but the game is so cheap now you might as well just buy it for one and have the other as a sort of nice bonus.\n\nTLaD: 5/10 - Generally boring, uninteresting, but has its good bits, and come on it's still a GTA game!\nTBoGT: 9/10 - Definitely takes the cake as it never gets boring until the end of the story.\n\n(I have not touched upon the technical issues such as GFWL and such, but there is a mod called x_live_less (remove "_", Steam censors the name for some reason) that removes GFWL and may help you with any issues. I managed to play the game start to finish with GFWL installed and updated no problem, but this may be different for you. Keep in mind Steam refunds are a thing, and do not let this sway you from the purchase of this amazing expandalone!)","January 3","true","18.4"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","5","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nikolau37/recommended/12220/","nikolau37","Babilonia","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nikolau37/","554 products in account","Episodes from Liberty City é um pacote com as duas expansões de GTA 4, inicialmente lançadas separadamente, sendo que podem ser jogadas mesmo sem possuir o jogo de base. Ambas trazem pequenas variações no mapa em relação ao original e algumas pequenas novidades.\n\nO primeiro episódio, The Lost and Damned, diz respeito a uma gangue de motoqueiros que teve seu líder (Billy Grey) capturado pela polícia. Até que ele pudesse retornar, a gangue passou a ser comandada por Johnny Klebitz que guiou seus companheiros à prosperidade.\n\nNo entanto, anos se passaram e com o retorno de Billy, ele estava totalmente transformado de forma que sua liderança estava destruindo tudo que havia sido construído e pondo em risco seus membros. Esta situação faz com que alguns dos membros se revoltem.\n\nNesta expansão, o jogador controla Johnny, que por sinal se movimenta muito devagar, bem mais devagar que Nicko. Como há um maior foco em motocicletas, foram acrescentados alguns modelos novos e tornou-se praticamente impossível cair delas.\n\nUma coisa ruim é que as vozes dos motoqueiros não combinam com os personagens e nos faz ter dificuldade de saber quem é quem está falando, o que prejudica um pouco o entendimento dos diálogos.\n\nJá o segundo episódio, The Ballad of Gay Tony, assumimos o papel de Luis Lopez, braço direito de Tony Prince, um viadinho dono das melhores boates em Liberty City. Luis é sócio de Tony e eles são apenas amigos, sendo que não há nenhuma outra relação entre eles.\n\nDiferente dos outros personagens, Luis vive na vida boa, tem um bom apartamento e várias mulheres. O problema é que o negócio das boates já não está tão lucrativo como antes, e seu mentor Tony se meteu em algumas enrascadas tentando diversificar os investimentos.\n\nThe Ballad of Gay Tony tem as melhores músicas tocando nas rádios contando todos os GTA’s já lançados, pelo menos na minha opinião, além de missões frenéticas e um sistema de pontuação por missão que premia o jogador em realiza-las usando métodos específicos.\n\nHá nas duas expansões algumas adições muito bem vindas, como um sistema de checkpoints nas missões em que, no caso de falha, o jogador não precisa repetir a missão desde o começo, mas sim do último checkpoint.\n\nTambém foram adicionados novos mini games, como queda de braço e competição de bebida, corridas com bastões e habilidade para dançar. Foi retirada (felizmente) a necessidade de ficar ligando para as pessoas para manter relacionamentos.\n\nO interessante é que as tramas das expansões ocorrem paralelamente a do jogo principal, sendo que por várias vezes passamos pelo mesmo local onde ocorreu algum evento e podemos ver os personagens dos outros jogos realizando as ações que fizemos, quando estávamos jogando com eles.\n\nAlém disso, as histórias são interligadas, com várias referencias cruzadas, e há situações em que realizaremos missões  com a participação dos personagens dos outros jogos, o que nos ajuda a entender melhor qual o que ocorreu em cada evento.\n\nAlgo que já acontecia no GTA 4 original, mas agora é muito frequente é o recebimento de alguma ligação que faz iniciar uma missão qualquer... Isso é muito chato porque não há como não aceitar e você deverá fazer aquela missão compulsoriamente naquele momento, mesmo que tivesse em mente fazer outra coisa.\n\nNão se pode deixar de mencionar que também foram herdados alguns bugs do título principal, mas pelo menos são bem menos numerosos, e não atrapalham tanto jogar como eram naquele, de forma que não há quase nada para reclamar do jogo.\n\nNo fim das contas, se você jogou GTA 4, é praticamente obrigatório que você jogue suas expansões também, pois são bastante sólidas e talvez até mais divertidas que o título principal. EXCELENTE (9/10).\n","January 4, 2015","true","25.0"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","62","8","13","2","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/aejira/recommended/12220/","aejira","aejira","http://steamcommunity.com/id/aejira/","537 products in account","Summary: Overall The Ballad of Gay Tony and The Lost and Damned are great standalones with slight improvements to the original GTA 4. Each one offers roughly 5-9 hours of gameplay and new elements such as parachuting, base jumping, mini-games, weapons, and vehicles. 4.5/5.\n\nPackaged together, Episodes from Liberty City offer two standalone games that take on very different approaches to the original gameplay in GTA 4. Both offer their own single-player campaigns with roughly 5 hours of missions, mini-games, and a variety of new weapons and vehicles to spice up your experience. The stories, just like the original, are well-written and interweaves with Niko Bellic. Playing the original and then through the episodes will give a second perspective on who did what, where the diamonds came from, and so on. They aren't heavily dependent on knowing the original plot, but they can be better appreciated if you've played through it.\n\nThe Lost and Damned takes the perspective of Johnny Klebitz, the vice-president of The Lost Motorcycle Club (TLMC). As you would expect, you primarily travel by motorcycle and much of the storyline is around the MC and their conflict with the police, rival gangs, and eventually the mafia.  There is a healthy heaping of new music revolving around the 1% culture, weapons such as the sawn-off shotgun and grenade launcher, and mini-games in the clubhouse such as arm-wrestling and air hockey. One of the big improvements, at least in my eyes, is the use of mid-mission respawns. If you die or fail a mission, restarting it via phone will no longer pull you to the very beginning of the mission. You will probably respawn before the segment where you failed, started. This cuts down on the amount of needless driving when you fail a mission and makes it less of a hassle restarting.\n\nThe second episode is the Ballad of Gay Tony, which doesn't take you from the perspective of the flamboyantly gay Tony Prince (whom you may have noticed in Niko's story), but his bodyguard and partner Luis Lopez. If TLAD focused on motorcycles, it's safe to say that TBGT focused on helicopters, base jumping, parachuting, and night clubs. Again, TBGT's plot is interwoven into the original plot and fleshes out much of the why's and how's of that story. As with TLAD, there's almost a good half-dozen new mini-games, such as golf, dancing, drinking, parachuting, and races. If you had a hard time with the helicopter controls, then bad news, about 1/4 of the missions require piloting a helicopter at some point. Generally the storyline is well-written, the characters are great with Yusuf, the playboy millionaire Arab, Mori, the bodybuilding dwarf with a God complex, and Bulgarin, the Russian mobster collecting American rock memoribilia. The characters drive the storyline well and leaves the game with a satisfying conclusion.\n\nOverall the game improves on a few issues from the original, but there are still a few things that hamper your gaming experience. Controls are still finicky, with driving still painful (you'll come to hate motorcycles on the final TBGT mission), flight controls difficult, and shooting still frustrating at times. It'll put a smile on your face when you see an NPC struggle to get in and out of a vehicle, but make you cringe when your characters' pathing causes him to dart back-and-forth around a vehicle. Mission restart has been improved, maybe some way of fast-travel would make driving less of a burden but I'm sure they want the playtime to be buffed higher by needless traveling. In summary, it's a strong buy and I highly recommend the game, I think that if you especially like the original then you'll find enjoyment with the episodes. 4.5/5.","October 12, 2014","true","13.8"," 12 of 21 people (57%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","57","12","21","2","0"

What you probably want to hear is whether it's worth getting, whether it fills the gap until GTA 5 hits the shelves. So in a word, yes. In two words, sort of.\n\nThe game engine is still the GTA IV engine, of course; don't expect any dramatic changes between GTA IV and Episodes From Liberty City (EFLC). The only discernible differences are better driving (motorbikes! yay!) and cover taking mechanics, as well as slightly better AI and new radio content.\n\nThe graphics are still the same ones that taxed the hell outta all our PC's back when IV was released; this old engine seems to have been optimized quite a bit since then, even if the physics are still a bit buggy in large scale explosions or bridge traffic pileups (yup, they still periodically do that weird stacking thing on the bridge).\n\nThe AI as mentioned before has better cover taking, especially when in a firefight with allies. But, when ♥♥♥♥ gets real, you'll quickly realise that the AI can't handle certain things. There were moments in my playthrough where i'd be in a firefight and just move myself behind a solid object that i could still fire over or around, and find myself then being able to systematically slaughter any bot that had the temerity to walk into my fireline.\n\nThe soundtrack to the game is pretty decent. The LC Rock station with Iggy Pop in particular was to my mind the best thing about the Radio stations. There's a fair few gems in the limited new content the radio stations get, but after a while you'll probably find yourself adding your own music just to keep things fresh.\n\nThe storyline is alright; it fills in gaps between key events in Niko Bellic's story. In terms of the quality of the storytelling it's more or less your usual GTA fare. Lots of violence, swearing, racism, homophobia and misogyny coupled with explosions, gun fights and chase sequences. EFLC is just as cheesy, offensive and satirical as GTA has ever been, so if that's your bag you're in for a fun, nostalgic ride through that familiar virtual cesspit that is Liberty City.\n\nTo summarise, there's nothing really *new* here, and whilst it's certainly a lot of fun revisiting LC through the eyes of two very different characters, after the 30 or so hours of gameplay it takes to rinse through it all, you can't help but feel like it was fun, but you've done it all before. You'll almost certainly find yourself very quickly forgetting the characters and their stories, but at least you'll have enjoyed the process.\n\nOverall: 3.5/5\n\nAudio: 3/5\nGraphics: 3/5\nGameplay: 4/5\n\n\nNothing groundbreaking, revisits a lot of old ground, but it's still an exciting sojourn through a living, breathing city.","January 29, 2015","true","35.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

Most annoying things has been fixed: steering, physics, combat, even radios has been improved. Both "The Lost and Damned" and "Ballad of Gay Tony" have more interesting stories, more diverse gameplay (attack helicopters, sky diving, and combined vehicle races). Interesting side activities are back while NOBODY calls you up for a bowling every 2 minutes.\nBefore playing Episodes from Libery City I haven't got high hopes for GTAV, now I've changed my mind. The only problem with this DLC is that is standalone and all the changes are not implemented into GTAIV itself\nP.S. GTA SA is still the bestest.","February 1","true","38.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/14dayfreetrial/recommended/12220/","14dayfreetrial","Pink Panzieeee","http://steamcommunity.com/id/14dayfreetrial/","193 products in account","(Notice: This review will some what act like two. I will cover both The Ballad of Gay Tony and The Lost and Damned on two seperate subjects. If you want to skip through you can. It's all labbled for you.)\nGrand Theft Auto: Episodes from Liberty City is a must have for any Grand Theft Auto fan.\nBoth Ballad of Gay Tony and The Lost and Damned are wounderful editions to the Grand Theft Auto family.\nYou wont be too unfamiliar towards both Louis Lopez nor Johnny Klebbitz if you played throught most of the story of Niko Belic.\nEnough with the intro, lets first start off with the Ballad of Gay Tony!\n\nThe Ballad of Gay Tony (TBoGT)\nIn TBoGT you play as Louis Lopez. A body guard for Gay Tony, the owner of two of the hottest clubs.\nSeems like a nice life, right? Wrong. Gay Tony is in a bad spot, battling drug addiction, a gold digger boy friend and finacial issues with the Russian Mafia that could cause him to loose his clubs... or life. Louis is trying his best to help Tony, but it becomes hard with his two childhood friends Armando Torres and Henrique Bardas give him a hard time for working with Tony and claiming that Louis is pretending to be something that he's not. On top of that, Luis's mother is also getting loans from Mr. Santo. That may not sound too bad, but I'll leave you a quote from Mr. Santo - "It's business. We run a service, she knew the rules. She should have read the small print."\n\nGameplayIf you've played Grand Theft Auto IV then you have a good set of mind on how the gameplay is like.\nThere's nothing new on how mechanics work out, and the missions are about the same, but some of them have a new twist.\nThere are a few flying missions in TBoGT and I found it a bit dificult to fly helicopters with the keyboard and mouse, but with a little practice, I had a easier time with it.\nWith TBoGT there are some new added weapons and vehicles which you will find within the first hour of playing.\nThere is also some new added music to most, if not all radio stations.\n\nPros-\nOutstanding Story\nNew Weapons/Vehicals/Music\nLikeable Characters\nIntervenes with GTA IV story\nMost of the missions don't feel like a rinse/repeat\nMods\nGood story length for a DLC\n\nCons-\nFlying Missions can be stressful without a gamepad\nCan be buggy\n\n\n\nSummaryI really enjoyed TBoGT and the story caught my attention right off the bat. I know some people would disagree with me about the story, which is alright, cause it's slightly different from what most GTA stories consist of and I think that may be the reason why I liked it so much. I also found Tony Prince to be a likable character and found him and Louis to work well together. Hopefully you will be able to see that if you choose to play through The Ballad of Gay Tony.\n\n\nThe Lost and Damned (TLAD)In TLAD you play as Johnny Klibbitz. Member of The Lost Motorcycle Club, along side with William "Billy" Grey,  James "Jim" Fitzgerald, Brian "BJ" Jeremy, Terrence "Terry" Thorpe and Clayton "Clay" Simons. Billy has recently been released from rehab after being "cured" of his heroin addiction and retakes his position as the club's President. Johnny and the rest of the gang are "excited" for Billy's release, but soon find that things are starting to head south after Billy neglects to run things more 'formal' than last he was President. You'll see that Billy likes to do things the old fanshion way and how everyone starts to pick sides with either Johnny or Billy on the matter of how the Club should be run and certain situations should be handled.\n\nGameplaySame as TBoGT not much is different from Grand Theft Auto IV.\nTLAD also adds new vehicles, weapons and some added songs from most if not all radio stations.\nWhen it comes to newly added vehicles, you have a good amount of added motorcycles. So, if you enjoyed riding motorcycles in Grand Theft Auto IV, you'll love the hell out of TLAD.\nNow with motorcycles being your main transportaion around Liberty City, Rock Star made it less sensitive for you to wreck/fall off your motor bike, so don't worry about that.\nIf you're a biker or liked the Sons of Anarchy you'll really enjoy this story line.\n\nPros-\nA good gritty story\nTransition of riding motorcycles as main transportation\nVery Likable Characters\nIntervenes with GTA IV story\nMods\nNew weapons, vehicles, music\nLikable/Lovable Characters\n\nCons-\nRepetitive missions\nCan have that rinse/repeat feeling with missions\nCan be buggy\nStory feels shorter than TBoGT\n\n\nSummaryThe lost and Damned is pretty good and if you are a GTA story fan, like myself, you don't want to miss out on this title.\nThe lower rating is mainly due to the story lenght. I could be wrong, but it felt shorter than TBoGT and I felt they could have added more to the story. I really liked that I felt as if I was apart of a motorcycle club and actually lived in a more run down part of town. It allows you to play more around in some parts of the map that you may have missed in GTA IV or TBoGT.","October 16, 2014","true","51.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Still retaining the features from GTA IV The Lost and Damned and The Ballad of Gay Tony both add new features in the game that can only be used when playing EFLC for example The Ballad of Gay Toy adds parachutes to the game so now you can go and jump off the empire state building and not die when you hit the ground. Like in GTA IV you still explore Liberty City just this time you can access places that could not be accessed in GTA IV. Like I said the story for both games really will hook you in like GTA IV's story hooked me in when I first played the game both games adds up to about 80 hours of gameplay which will keep people entertained throughout both games. So if you're looking to buy a GTA game I really really recommend you get GTA IV and GTA EFLC they are both very enjoyable games and they will both blow you away without a doubt!.","June 14, 2014","true","6.0"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

(helps if you set GFWL to auto sign in, or game might restart a couple times before you log in)\n\n-Had a problem with the game not detecting a 3GB RAM vid card, so the graphics were "locked" at 800x600 with all settings set to low, had to go to the Steam entry for the game in your library under properties and launch options, add the commands: -norestrictions -availablevidmem 100\n\n-Game still started in 800x600, but now the graphics options were unlocked and correctly reads 3GB memory, so just set graphics to max and all set!\n\nOf course I can't guarantee this will work for everyone, but did for me.\n\nHave fun!","December 13, 2014","true","23.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

The lost and the damned is an excellent expansion, almost all the missions are fun, motorcycles become cool to use.  It's flat out fantastic, the plot is great and I'm not into choppers!  Sadly, the Ballad of Gay Tony is the weakest of the 3 and the last to be played.  While the plot is interesting and you'll want to know how it ends, the missions in this one are very difficult and extremely frustrating!  It's as if they said, "Hey? how can we possibly make this scenario pack really hard?  We'll just include TONS of missions with helicopters that are really difficult to drive!  You need to fly it with the number pad, the w key, the shift key, AND the mouse to fire weapons!  But don't press A, you'll instantly jump out of the chopper.  One of these missions made me so mad I punched the couch!  Anyway, overall it's totally worth it if you've beaten GTA IV.","January 18, 2012","true","34.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

You are all probably familiar with Grand Theft Auto, shoot stuff, run over people, kill police officers and perfrom other violent, sadistic fun actions. This game does have a plot which crosses over with Grand Theft Auto 4, so some things may be unclear if you have not played it. Aside from all that, the amount of mods for this game, good God! You can get legitimate real life cars, have more traffic diversity, get an entirely new map, be a police officer, the sky is the limit. If you ever finish the game or get bored of going on rampages while taking countless lives, then the mods will increase your play time, there are so many! The excellent modability is what makes this game truly worthwhile, the money you will pay is a small price to pay for the endless gameplay capability. There are a few compatibility issues with Windows 8, and you need a nuclear powered computer to run this game with full graphics and all the mods, but frankly I have an adequate computer and I am able to run the LCPDFR mod and a couple car mods at medium settings quite well. In the end, this game is fantastic not only because of the mods, but because of its good plot, and wide lively envirnoment.\n","March 7, 2015","true","31.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The Ballad of Gay Tony in particular was clearly an attempt at Rockstar getting back it's lost fanbase.\n\nThe stories are interesting and the parallels to the main game fitting in places. However more then that they are a decent length. GTA4 made you feel it's length very often. The storyline felt really overly lengthy for such a small amount of things actually accomplished. In both of these episodes the storylines are tighter and more constrained. Not that it's a bad thing after all, they actually feel a lot more polished as a result.\n\nI recommend getting these if you already liked GTA4 but chances are, if you didn't like GTA4 you're most likely not going to buy these anyway.","December 30, 2012","true","27.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This DLC actually contains two stories: you play as Johnny and also as Luis. Both stories take place in Liberty City and should be launched separately. Lost of The Damned felt a bit boring as the game put too much emphasis on the use of motorbikes. So, after a while I hated I couldn't really get into a car but Luis's story compensated me for that.\n\nThere isn't much to say about these two stories. Everything is identical to the things we got used to in GTA IV. Perhaps, many of the missions seems a bit more over the top but it only increased the fun for me.\n\nPutting the bad optimisation aside this is a damn fine DLC.

If you've played GTAIV you kinda know the basics of a GTA game and yeah this has them. But if you were picking this up as an expansion on GTAIV's story; probably not worth it.\n\nThe story was kind of lack-luster, sometimes it was there, sometimes it just plain wasn't. The gameplay during missions was often more stressful than fun, having to retry things over and over again because your precision aim catching the guy you just chucked out of the helicopter wasn't quite right, or you did something slightly wrong..

You are all probably familiar with Grand Theft Auto, shoot stuff, run over people, kill police officers and perfrom other violent, sadistic fun actions. This game does have a plot which crosses over with Grand Theft Auto 4, so some things may be unclear if you have not played it. Aside from all that, the amount of mods for this game, good God! You can get legitimate real life cars, have more traffic diversity, get an entirely new map, be a police officer, the sky is the limit. If you ever finish the game or get bored of going on rampages while taking countless lives, then the mods will increase your play time, there are so many! The excellent modability is what makes this game truly worthwhile, the money you will pay is a small price to pay for the endless gameplay capability. There are a few compatibility issues with Windows 8, and you need a nuclear powered computer to run this game with full graphics and all the mods, but frankly I have an adequate computer and I am able to run the LCPDFR mod and a couple car mods at medium settings quite well. In the end, this game is fantastic not only because of the mods, but because of its good plot, and wide lively envirnoment.\n","March 7, 2015","true","31.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Having the keyboard and mouse in addition to a 360 controller is great. What I love best though is the modding abilities.

This is better than the base game. The missions are more entertaining plus you have access to more cars and more awesome weapons. Playing online with friends is a blast, and there are plenty of great mods out there that make the game look less outdated. However, its important to note this game is still poorly-optimized for the PC and requires a lot more hardware than it should to run smoothly.","December 2, 2013","true","14.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Yes, without a doubt.\n\nThe problem is that the PC version is one of the worst ports you'll ever find.\nI had several problems that prevented me from even starting the game. I can't actually start the game via steam because I have to manually run the "LaunchEFLC.exe" file as administrator for it to actually start, or I will receive an error.\nI was also unable to edit anny graphics options due to a deliberate barrier set up to prevent you from changing the graphics if your PC is weak. Problem is, it also happens when your GPU has more than 2GB of VRAM.\nLast but not least, the game would automatically crash because I hadn't installed and patched Games For Windows Live.\n\nEven after I got it to work, there are still plenty of gameplay-related issues. Also, the framerate is unacceptable with my specs considered, and it even manages to crash to desktop now and then.\n\nTL;DR: Get it for your console if you can instead.","March 5, 2014","false","31.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Since I was a little kid going over to my friends house playing San Andreas and useing cheates for stuff and how I thought what you could do was unlimited. But now that I have gotten into actualy playing the game and not just messing around with it and have sat down and played the older GTA's and beaten most of them I think I would be able to say what I think of this game and how it dose with entertaning gamers.\nWhat I think of this game is kinda a downgrad of what was set by the older game's. The feeling of no limitles was removed from this game. In SA you could roam and see all the sights and have a blast and feel like you could do anything. In this game it is about story more than open world stuff. While it is open world the standers set by SA have not been reached in here. While it has a really good story it felt like you could do nothing after you compleated the game. All you could do was just roam and cause distuction. While that's fun and all it was all you could really do with out having mods installed. And all the money you collected you could spend it on nothing. No car mods no houses  nothing. All you could use that money for was to buy some new clothing. Dose this make it a bad game? No, not at all. I still recommend it. But don't expect all the fun and hours of enjoyment you would get from the older games. Still for any old time fans of the GTA series it's still a good buy. Just don't expect it to be like GTA 5 or SA. Those are the best in the series in my oppenion.","October 1, 2013","true","24.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Two episodes that span around 15 hours of gameplay (more if you're going to do everything). It feels like a whole new game. Yes, the city is still the same, but the stories aren't and the missions are quite diverse. One thing I really liked was the fact that all important characters are in a way part of the other characters' stories. The graphics and details are still awesome to this day (and the faces could still use some work). The missions from The Lost And Damned (and the story itself) aren't as much fun when compared to The Ballad Of Gay Tony. The missions in Gay Tony range from racing to stealing and basejumping. There's also a few helicopter missions. Flying a helicopter is a pain in the ♥♥♥ though, and it's one of the things I really hate. But that can be overlooked. This game is great !

Around 40 hours gameplay which is about the same as the original main game! Totally worth it for that reason alone. Lots of little side missions to complete.\n+ Graphics are good.\n+ Two different story arcs, one following the Lost Motorcycle Club and the other focused on Gay Tony, a nightclub owner. Both of these stories are interesting, the characters stand out and it's extremely fun.\n+ Nice shooting and combat as usual!\n+ Some real blockbuster moments towards the end, which is great.\n\nNegatives:\n\nI can't really see anything bad about this expansion. Tonnes of gameplay time, engaging and enjoyable, price comes down on sale regularly.\n\nOverall Score: 8.5/10\n\nTo be honest, these two expansions alone could be more intriguing than the entire main game mode. At least, it's on par. Very good expansion that is worth purchasing when cheap.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zweistein_Jimmy/recommended/12220/","zweistein_Jimmy","monster elf","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zweistein_Jimmy/","226 products in account","I most enjoyed this title even though it was on the same map as GTA4 it had so much to offer!!\n\nPROS:✔ Sick story telling with huge amounts of humor. Man I will never get bored of some of the hilarious moments during dialogues and cinematics while doing quests.\n✔ They kept the radio stations interesting. Indeed they did! Loved the talkshows. Loved the commercials. Loved that they kept the independence radio station system. And totally loved the hilariousness included in each dialogue, comment or ad in them as should be in a predecessor of the GTA cult!\n✔ Interesting script. Especially loved the The Ballad of Gay Tony. I first played the tBoGT and afterwards I played tLaD campaign. I enjoyed it. And I totally loved how nicely they both blend in the exact same world in the exact same timing.\n✔ Loved the little crossovers here and there with Niko from GTA4.\n✔ Absolutely awesome quality and quantity of weapons!\n✔ Insane attention to details by the devs. From the graphical effects of dust and dirt on surfaces down to pedestrian AIs and material and texture design. The city looks live and real. Hell, even the music and sound effects are more realistic! Even braking the glass of a car's window affects the music volume from the car radio!!\n✔ Awesome voice acting as expected from a GTA game.\n✔ Awesome water and sea dynamics. It felt so natural and relaxing driving a boat, even if it was a really slow one.\n\nCONS:✖ Terrible follower AI. Their combat tactics and driving skills were a complete disaster. They kept getting in the way many times during battles. They drive like freakin psychopaths on crack even if you drive like a 70yo lady.\n✖ I was expecting a way better lip sync.\n✖ Inexcusable rendering mistakes from various city locations. Invisible walls or flooring and pavement textures. They are not many. But they shouldn't really exist. I mean they did put down so much detail in so many other things and some of the graphical bugs are so hard to miss it makes you think they were too bored to care fixing them.\n✖ WHY THE HELL DO YOU FORCE US TO PUT UP WITH THAT PIECE OF SH*T GAMES FOR WINDOWS LIVE INTERFACE? F*cking Hell it ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off all the time!! App runs like a freakin faulty spyware! Can't get rid of it, eating up space and bandwidth. Kept disconnecting all the freakin time and totally bugged out 90% of my checkpoint auto-save games (it actually kept informing me that I already had the checkpoint savegames from quests I was doing for the first time!). WTH dudes?!? Is't the Rockstar Games Social Club app enough for middleware launch and you also had to add the buggy as f*ck Games For Windows Live interface too? WHY?\nHeard that GTA5 won't be having it.... Thank God!\n\nMIXED:☢ Some face expressions needed a bit work done. They made a great effort bringing realism in all characters plain NPC citizents included. But then you get to see some hideous face expressions from women when dancing with them at the club. Or seeing yoru character having the same angry face expression through the game even if all the action is hours (ingame) past the moment.\n☢ I really wish we could dive underwater...\n☢ I needed more collectibles.\n\nFINAL VERDICT:I enjoyed the game a whole lot, so much that I was able to put aside all the negatives or mixed feelings during gameplay that I would totally recommend this game.\nI'm giving it a 8/10.\nFor me personally it could had been higher if it wasn't for the irritating Games For Windows Live interface.\nit's a good enjoyable game worth spending time on. If your PC can handle it and haven't played it yet please do.\nTotally worth buying on special offers.","March 31, 2015","true","75.5"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","3"

I cannot for the life of me change the resolution in the graphics setting\n\nControls:\nIf I move my mouse too slow in the main menu, it just simply doesn't register.  Also, trying to play the very first mission in Lost and Damned (you know, driving the bike to the church), when I would try to make a turn, the bike would spin out.  Over and over.  I've play GTA IV and it doesn't do this.\n\nFeatures:\nFirst you have the Steam overlay.  Which is fine.  Then you have GFWL.  OK.  Then you have the Rockstar social club.  Seriously?

Created by Rockstar North in the United Kingdom, it contains both The Lost and Damned and The Ballad of Gay Tony on one disc.[1] It was released alongside the DLC release of The Ballad of Gay Tony on 29 October, 2009 for the Xbox 360 and released on 13 April, 2010 for Microsoft Windows and PlayStation 3.\nUnlike the downloadable versions of the episodes, the compilation does not require a copy of Grand Theft Auto IV to play, nor is an Xbox Live or PlayStation Network account necessary (except for multiplayer). The content is also played straight from the disc, and does not need to be installed on a hard drive to play, like various other disc-based expansions for other Xbox 360 games that have been released in the past. Available exclusively on the Episodes from Liberty City disc are three new in-game radio stations – Vice City FM, RamJam FM and Self-Actualization FM.","January 6, 2014","true","5.2"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

I love the serie, I really do, but this PC version is just terrible! The game is a masterpiece, I've played it a million times on my Xbox 360, but this PC version is a just one of the worst ports I ever seen...\nThe issue with this game is basically just one: Performance.\nThe performance of this game is atrocious, the optimization is really bad. I have a medium-end PC that, according with the system requirements, would run it almost on the maximum performance. Guess what? I had to put the lowest game options on everything, no shadows, no anti-aliasing, minimum distance-view, no V-sync, and still only achieved 10 fps, lot of crashes, etc...\n\nBasically, this game is only playable in highest end PCs, and even on those the performance isn't really good.\nUntil this game is properly optimized (which is never), I can't recomend this to anyone.\n\nIts really a shame, it's an imensely good game, but unplayble...

The choppers are some of the better handing vehicles in the game, and there was almost always at least one around, and so you never had to drive one of those 4 wheeled icy marshmellows commonly known as 'cars' in GTA4 unless you REALLY wanted to.\n\nIn addition to having your trusty gang deliver a bike to you whenever you wanted, you could also call them for backup, either just for fun, or to help you out on a difficult mission. Successfully completing missions leveled your gang members up, actually making them even more useful.\n\nLost was definitely the most enjoyable version of GTA4 for me. Probably because it felt a little more like Saints Row.\n\nThe Ballad of Gay Tony wasn't quite as good as Lost, mostly because you were back to reliance on cars for most of your traveling and didn't have the option of backup whenever you wanted. But it DID have the explosive shotgun.\n\nAnd dancing. Don't ask me why the dancing was so fun. Maybe because the rest of the gameplay was so meh.\n\nGetting a dance-off going at the Hercules was probably the best part of the episode.\n\nEach episode was around 10 hours for mostly the story missions, but they felt a lot more fun overall. While you still got calls to hang out every so often, it wasn't nearly as bad as GTA4.\n\nThere also weren't as many difficult missions as there were in GTA4, and there were much more plentiful checkpoints in the ones that were difficult.\n\nWhile Episodes still shares a lot of problems with GTA4, if you REALLY want to play a GTA4 game, I'd recommend just playing Episodes from Liberty City. There will be a few plot holes, but who's playing a GTA game for plot?","May 19, 2014","true","23.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Here's a link to that one if you're interested.  I'm in no way endorsing or encouraging piracy, and I think everyone should support worthwhile developers by purchasing their games and products. That's just a disclaimer because what I'm about to say may actually get me banned. Pirates literally have an easier time playing these games (and other select titles from Rockstar) due to GFWL's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t DRM. If you have a Live account and want to be able to play your saved games WHENEVER YOU WANT, just like you would be able to with the console versions of this game, you're ♥♥♥♥ out of luck. You'll have to make an offline profile to do that, which means you won't be able to play with your friends or show off your achievements to them, but I guess you can't have everything with Rockstar. If you were expecting save files to work the way they should, that is, saved locally and available to you WHENEVER, AT ANY TIME, EVEN WHEN YOU'RE NOT CONNECTED TO THE INTERNET, you should look elsewhere, because you won't find any of that common sense here. When your game, through sheer always-online DRM ♥♥♥♥ery, makes it easier for pirates to play the game than PAYING ♥♥♥♥ING CUSTOMERS WHO DOLED OUT THEIR HARD EARNED MONEY EXPECTING A PRODUCT THAT JUST ♥♥♥♥ING WORKS THE WAY IT SHOULD IN RETURN, you have FAILED. Failed MISERABLY, in fact. And that save file ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to GFWL's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. It isn't just Rockstar games, either. Any game that uses GFWL is full of issues that are usually directly caused by it. A good general rule of thumb is to just avoid any game that has, or has ever had, GFWL integrated into it. You'll be setting yourself up for failure and disappointment, not necessarily in that order.","March 24, 2015","false","3.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Our main hero — the Vice-President office of the brotherhood of the Lost in liberty city. He calmly and judiciously conducts business of the organization, one does not give offense to and all that. A real goodie, although in the course of action a will release caustic jokes about its origin. Anyway, while the President of the section — Billy gray — rehabilitated from heroin addiction, johnny earned a reputation and proved himself a good leader. And then one happy day the leader returned from work and immediately began imposing a new order.\n\nApparently, during treatment, and much Billy thought hard about the softness of the seat under your own ♥♥♥, so his first action on the outside was the war with another gang called Angels of Death. Moreover, the reasons for this newly issued Chapter has chosen not the most successful — lies, deception, incitement and slander. For example, the daughter of Mikhail Faustin contacted the biker of the Lost — we killed it in the role of Niko. This situation without a trial Billy gray dumped for a rival group and with hoots led the brothers to destroy their headquarters. Actually the reason for the attack was heroin, which the President later again and tied. Johnny stands at the head of the gang... and it's time to figure out what you can do in liberty city, when fighting on the shoulders of the leather jacket, in the hand of the evil gun, and at his back a powerful rumbling chopper.\n\nThe Ballad of Gay Tony\n\n"Ballad" should be taken only after The Lost and Damned. Otherwise you will be disappointed: additions are so different in execution, I can't believe the story of a biker at least some relation to the glitz and glamour of night life. This, of course, not about the appearance of the main characters.\n\nDespite the name, we will not be in the role of Tony (it would probably have caused a rejection from the audience), and in the skin of his best friend, companion and just a great man Luis Lopez. He's a regular guy, without protruding ambitions and, frankly, not particularly clever. But sincere and honest, calm and considerate, sensitive and loyal friend, but if you really ♥♥♥♥ him off...

So i download the latest version of windows live for windows 10 from the microsoft website and lauch the game, that took me an hour to do. Then after i launch the game and start it up the  quality of the graphics was horrendus so i open up the menu and go to set the game to run at a higher resolution and guess what i cant... So i looked up a video and typed in some commands and was able to change the resolution. Then i get back on the game with no problem. Then i wanted to play online and i try to and it tells me I have to log into Social Club, so i quit the game and went to log into Social Club and i type in the CORRECT PASSWORD AND USERNAME THAT I HAD JUST RESTET  and try to click play but no there was the next problem it says "Social Club login failed , please try again" so i gave up, i have NEVER had such a bad experince with a steam game.","April 21","false","3.8"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","2"

First, I can't run the game without crashing, then I finally get GFWL working (the step I missed when giving up on Dark Souls months ago (which I still haven't played) was apparently restarting my computer after installing the correct version of GFWL which had to be obtained manually online (why microsoft made an operating system that doesn't work properly out of the box with the stupid stupid GFWL thing that they created (and should be ashamed of) is beyond me).\n\nSo, some number of days ago I got the stupid GFWL thing working so that I could play the game, what's this I see immediately? 'Sign in to some special "Rockstar social club" thing to play online'... um... ok... sure, I mean I didn't have to do any of this stupid pointless stuff when I played on console... but sure...\n\nSo I make the account and think, well at least it's not like that stupid thing in Dark Souls (which I ran once to see if it worked) where I had to create a windows live profile to even save the game (foreshadowing... creepy).\n\nSo I start up the expansion and, about 10 seconds in, realize that the keyboard controls are unplayable, at least from what I'm used to, I honestly don't know how anyone could play this with a keyboard, but whatever, I've needed a better controller for a while now so I ordered a 360 knockoff from ebay and forgot about GTA for a while.\n\nSo the controller comes in and I get around to playing GTA, first, somewhat of an aside, I go to the graphics section and see a benchmark. Oh neat! I think to myself, I can run a benchmark and see if I want to try and push any of the recomended settings a bit higher, good deal. The benchmark runs to completion and then...\n\nPC : EFLC.exe has stopped working.\n\nMe: Oh well, it was a nice thought while it lasted.\n\nAnyway, I forget the benchmark and start the game, seems pretty good so far, kind of a long winded intro and they introduce a follow the leader mechanic which looks like it's going to be kind of annoying, oh look a safehouse... that's cool, look at all of the things I can do, I'll have to check that out...\n\nGame: Autosave feature has failed, you need to sign in to a LIVE-enabled account to save\n\nMe: Of course, I knew expecting there to only be one account that I need to play this game was too much to ask for... nevermind the fact that I never needed to sign in to live when playing on the console, and nevermind that I'm just trying to SAVE MY GAME IN A SINGLE PLAYER GAME MODE WITHOUT SIGNING INTO AN ONLINE SERVICE. Whatever, you win this round M$.\n\nNaturally I can't be bothered to remember what e-mails I've used for various Live accounts in the past (i've had several) so I decide to make a new one from scratch.\n\nWait, let me back up. You see, before I can get a Live account, I first need a Microsoft account for it to make the Live account from. OK, I'll bite:\n\nName:\nFirst: F*kYouAsswh*lesIJustWantToF*kingPlayGTA\nLast: ThisIsSoF*kingStupidF*kEveryOneOfYou\n[Note: asterisks added for this public review, the misspellings are because, apparently, if you're name contains profanity it can't be used for a M$ account, even though it's a required field.]\nUsername: f*ckGamesForWindowsLiveWith@BigRusty.Pole\n[again the asterisk is mine, the correct spelling of the word this time is also not a typo]\nPassword: *****\n[I guess I'll keep this one to myself for posterity, but, fun fact, originally it contained the word f**k, which was also set as the first name at the time (my form went through many revisions), the first error on trying to submit a form I saw was 'password cannot contain your name... hmm... TIL]\nCountry: US\nZip: 55555\nBday: 1/1/1905\nGender: female\nPhone: 5555555555\n\nNow, believe it or not, the form above worked properly (e-mail address and all) and I was taken to a one-click page to create my live account, how convenient!\n\nMS Site:\n"Uh oh... that shouldn't have happened.\n\nIt appears you've found a glitch in the system.\n\ndate:	6/20/2014 5:49:28 AM\ncode:	151E6149FFD7D49\ns:	q7KeB4D+ajX3cUOHdznk/A==\nid:	62a70191-7a10-40c4-8eea-61644ac6d1c7\nreq:	4c6e9268-5bd8-422c-a026-7b510f36ecf9\n"\n\nMe: Woohoo! I win!! I broke your system, I broke your system *does a dance*\n\nAnyway, yes, I had p*ssed [Edit: really guys? '♥♥♥♥♥♥' is a bad word?] them off, I'm not entirely sure how or what they were going to use for my username, but I ended up with the account ID/name: TendedFever6 which I guess is cute, but I digress.\n\nSo I go back to GTA, and I enter in the oh-so-wonderful e-mail address and type in my password and enter in the key that Steam gave me (that it finally decided to ask for) and blah blah blah and what's this, did it work? am I done?\n\nLive: LIVE needs an update!\n\nMe: God, of course, whatever, just shut up and do it, I don't care, just have your way with me if you must, just please, don't hurt me again.\n\nLive: Live is updating, this may require restarting your computer.\n\nMe: You better not restart my f*cking computer you piece of sh*t\n\nLive: Do do do, I am updating, do do do\n\nMe: I swear to god, if you restart my f*cking computer...\n\nLive: Guess what! you need to restart this game for the update thingy to work, so do that because we hate you.\n\nMe: You realize I haven't saved? The game took me like 15 min in until it showed the first safehouse before prompting the autosave (or showing a bed) and I can't save now because you won't let me until I sign in, and immediately after you let me sign in you told me that there was an update that I needed or I would be signed out, and then I said OK update and so you updated and need to close my game, which I haven't saved.\n\nSo I resign myself to go back to the game, turn off the autosave feature because I'm soft-locked with it enabled, make one last attempt to find some way to manually save even though I know it's futile, and then I close the game.\n\nThen Microsoft does it's stupid update on it's stupid ♥♥♥♥♥♥ piece of software that's just as ♥♥♥♥♥♥ after the update as it was beforehand.\n\nAnd then I launch the game. And then I sign into my profile, and then I'm logged in and it seems to work. I start up the expansion, it starts to load... and then I press Alt+F4 because I'm not in the mood to replay the 10-15 minutes that I lost, because I'm not in the mood to look at a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ GFWL game right now, and I feel dirty after what I've just had to do to be able to save a single player campaign.\n\nGTA is a great franchise, GFWL is a piece of ♥♥♥♥. Unfortunately they used that piece of ♥♥♥♥ to port this game, so ♥♥♥♥ it and ♥♥♥♥ Microsoft for making it the most appealing option.\n\nIf you run Windows 8 (I'm not proud, the PC came with it, but that's another rant) be ready for a potential headache if you haven't already figured out the whole 'getting games like Dark Souls and GTA IV to run because GFWL likes to error and fail by default'. Also, if you're like me and don't want to create yet another mostly-legitimate account for something you don't have any plan to use for much anything else at any time in the near future (but who doesn't have an XBox, right? maybe people who had the system die on them and didn't bother to get a replacement because there's other consoles out there that don't have a stupid high RROD fail rate? nah, that's crazy talk).\n\nAgain, I hear the expansions are great, but get 'em on PS3 or something, this is the type of thing that should just not be encouraged.\n\nAnyway, I had a fun waste of an evening and decided to waste even more time making this wonderful rant of a post. To anyone who made it this far, congrats and have a nice day.\n\nEdit: Formatting.","June 19, 2014","false","1.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Sure, the performances are good and the dialogue sounds natural, but I don't give a ♥♥♥♥ about any of these characters and the offensive content lacks any tact or grace, making it a bore.\n\nThe missions are your standard "Drive to point A, kill people, drive to point B" or "drive to point A, pick up a passenger, drive to point B (while killing people)"  Nothing special.\n\nIf you're itching for open world fun try out Saints Row III or IV or Sleeping Dogs.

But in order to save your game at all you need a Windows LIve account.\nI made one a while back to play Dead Rising 2 on steam, and I can't sign in to play this and it's really fustrating to make an account for Windows Live. I don't like restarting the game every time I exit. I also wouldn't recommend the Episodes from Liberty City, I would suggest the original game. These are just short stories basically, In one episode your a bike gang, in the other your a clubber who is in the gang again. But since it's Grand Theft Auto it has free play, so thats fun right off the bat. There is multiplayer but like I said in the beginning you need a Windows Live account, I would rate this game 4/10.","June 15, 2014","true","2.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I decided to try EFLC out since I heard it was better than the maingame. It IS better than the main game but not by much. And it still suffers from the same old ♥♥♥♥♥♥ GTA writing. Sure, the performances are good and the dialogue sounds natural, but I don't give a ♥♥♥♥ about any of these characters and the offensive content lacks any tact or grace, making it a bore.\n\nThe missions are your standard "Drive to point A, kill people, drive to point B" or "drive to point A, pick up a passenger, drive to point B (while killing people)"  Nothing special.\n\nIf you're itching for open world fun try out Saints Row III or IV or Sleeping Dogs.

Those people have just no idea. GFWL was NEVER a cloud saving system, that means that it DID NOT delete your saves, NOR it makes you unable to save at the moment. The game is totally fine in single player, in fact I booted up just this week to have some car fun. And guess what, I downloaded it from the steam library, launched, quit, imported my old save files (from 2010) I had on the HDD and put it in the right folder, launched the game again, and took from exactly where I left my character in 2010. GFWL *is not* connected to the savefiles, they are on the HDD. If you are not clever enough to understand that you should have backed up the savegame files before uninstalling the game last time, DON'T write reviews which are not helpful for the other users.\n\nI am speaking about single player. So: SINGLE PLAYER is totally fine and save system is fine too. I am not sure about multiplayer, but yes, it would be understandable that the online portion is totally failing at the moment. ***But single player is 100% the way it was before.***","April 8, 2015","true","53.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Even though it was a step back from GTA San Andreas on some points, like the removal of planes, it took GTA to the next era by adding Online modes like freemode (Which was a lot of fun back in the day) and improving the graphics. It improved on GTA IV by adding 2 new characters with their only seperate and unique stories and added new features like parachutes (Which for whatever reason are only in The Ballad of Gay Tony and not in The Lost and Damned which is a bit strange) and new vechicles and strangely enough the vechicles that appear in each story, don't appear in the other one which doesn't really make sense. Both stories and characters are unique and completely different from eachother.  Would recommend for fans of GTA.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DarkMythHunterRO/recommended/12220/","DarkMythHunterRO","Carl Johnson (CJ)","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DarkMythHunterRO/","39 products in account","--> ARGUMENT:\n\n-Getting two complete games for only $6,00 on Steam is something that nobody have to miss. I know, I know the price after the offer might be a bit too high, but as thinking, these games or DLC's has 2 different stories comparing them to Grand Theft Auto IV.\n-The gameplay is pretty impresive, you will spend at least 15 hours to complete both of these games, if we count the side-missions, it goes to 20-30 hours. Let's see how GTA IV TLAD & TBOGT behave.\n\n-The Lost And Damned shows us the story of a group of bikers, known in GTA IV aswell, they are 'THE LOST'. The protagonist is Johnny K, the leader of this group is Billy. The game is based more on bike races, bike-gangs conflicts and much more to explore.\n-The Ballad of Gay Tony is the second expansion of GTA IV. The innovation in this game is that, Rockstar, added lots of stuff in this game. Comparing it to GTA IV, is sightly better for me. You play as Luis Fernando Lopez and Tony gives you different missions related to: money, clubs, thiefs and girls. Very stilish.\n\n--> GTA IV: THE LOST AND DAMNED REVIEW\n\nGRAPHICS: They are the exact same as in GTA IV. The weather is a bit more different. Sometimes is very sunny and the ambiance is pretty orange, just like it's sunshine all the time, sometimes cloudly. If you have a good PC, you'll enjoy it. Some glitches are visible... (- 94/100 -)\nSOUND: More rock music added, just to fit in the game perfectly. Personally I don't like rock, but, for this game it's okay. Sound effects and everything is the same. (- 96/100 -)\nGAMEPLAY: Some bike controls are a bit annyoing. Bikes slips to much sometimes and that's a bit derp. Anyway everything is still the same. It has 22 missions and it can take you about 6-7 hours to complete them. But there's over 5-6 hours to complete the game at 100%, pretty good for a DLC. (- 97/100 -)\nFUN & INNOVATION: The story is really excited, if you are really interested on a 'biker' life. There are many bikes and a few cars added which makes all of us happy, right? (- 85/100 -)\n\nFINAL: 93/100. (VERY GOOD)\n\n--> GTA IV: THE BALLAD OF GAY TONY REVIEW\n\nGRAPHICS: The same as in GTA IV. Anyway I guess Rockstar fixed a bit some glitches, the effects are a little more realistic, probably they've updated RAGE and what else... nights are better. (- 100/100 -)\nSOUND: Voice acting, sound effects, music, everything is incredible in this game. (- 100/100 -)\nGAMEPLAY: The gameplay is the exact same as in the previous games. The only implemented thing is that you can drive more helicopters which is amazing... There are 25 missions which takes about 7-8 hours to complete them. But there's over 10 hours of secondary missions to archive 100%  (- 98/100 -)\nFUN & INNOVATION: It feels like GTA better than nothing. More variety to choose, lots of things added (parachutes, helicopters, vehicles, weapons) which kinda 'spits over GTA IV, GTA TLAD.' (- 100/100 -)\n\nFINAL: 100/100. (MASTERPIECE)\n\nCONCLUSION: Rockstar North did it again... the best DLC's of the history untill the date... let's see what GTA V can do soon.","June 14, 2014","true","7.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

They spice up GTA IV and add many things that make it a great -and better- experience than the original.\n\nThe GFWL comments aren't without their reasons, but the game is certainly playable. The single player experience is awesome. I'm not even halfway through TBoGT at the 15hr mark. I haven't played TLaTD, but can't wait. The campaign missions are more creative, the new weapons are way too fun (Jackhammer with explosive rounds, anyone?) and each time I play it I can't wait to find out what kind of mess I'll get myself into.\n\nGTAIV was fun to free-roam in, but the added weapons, locations, and things to do make this one stand out.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DarkMythHunterRO/recommended/12220/","DarkMythHunterRO","Carl Johnson (CJ)","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DarkMythHunterRO/","39 products in account","--> ARGUMENT:\n\n-Getting two complete games for only $6,00 on Steam is something that nobody have to miss. I know, I know the price after the offer might be a bit too high, but as thinking, these games or DLC's has 2 different stories comparing them to Grand Theft Auto IV.\n-The gameplay is pretty impresive, you will spend at least 15 hours to complete both of these games, if we count the side-missions, it goes to 20-30 hours. Let's see how GTA IV TLAD & TBOGT behave.\n\n-The Lost And Damned shows us the story of a group of bikers, known in GTA IV aswell, they are 'THE LOST'. The protagonist is Johnny K, the leader of this group is Billy. The game is based more on bike races, bike-gangs conflicts and much more to explore.\n-The Ballad of Gay Tony is the second expansion of GTA IV. The innovation in this game is that, Rockstar, added lots of stuff in this game. Comparing it to GTA IV, is sightly better for me. You play as Luis Fernando Lopez and Tony gives you different missions related to: money, clubs, thiefs and girls. Very stilish.\n\n--> GTA IV: THE LOST AND DAMNED REVIEW\n\nGRAPHICS: They are the exact same as in GTA IV. The weather is a bit more different. Sometimes is very sunny and the ambiance is pretty orange, just like it's sunshine all the time, sometimes cloudly. If you have a good PC, you'll enjoy it. Some glitches are visible... (- 94/100 -)\nSOUND: More rock music added, just to fit in the game perfectly. Personally I don't like rock, but, for this game it's okay. Sound effects and everything is the same. (- 96/100 -)\nGAMEPLAY: Some bike controls are a bit annyoing. Bikes slips to much sometimes and that's a bit derp. Anyway everything is still the same. It has 22 missions and it can take you about 6-7 hours to complete them. But there's over 5-6 hours to complete the game at 100%, pretty good for a DLC. (- 97/100 -)\nFUN & INNOVATION: The story is really excited, if you are really interested on a 'biker' life. There are many bikes and a few cars added which makes all of us happy, right? (- 85/100 -)\n\nFINAL: 93/100. (VERY GOOD)\n\n--> GTA IV: THE BALLAD OF GAY TONY REVIEW\n\nGRAPHICS: The same as in GTA IV. Anyway I guess Rockstar fixed a bit some glitches, the effects are a little more realistic, probably they've updated RAGE and what else... nights are better. (- 100/100 -)\nSOUND: Voice acting, sound effects, music, everything is incredible in this game. (- 100/100 -)\nGAMEPLAY: The gameplay is the exact same as in the previous games. The only implemented thing is that you can drive more helicopters which is amazing... There are 25 missions which takes about 7-8 hours to complete them. But there's over 10 hours of secondary missions to archive 100%  (- 98/100 -)\nFUN & INNOVATION: It feels like GTA better than nothing. More variety to choose, lots of things added (parachutes, helicopters, vehicles, weapons) which kinda 'spits over GTA IV, GTA TLAD.' (- 100/100 -)\n\nFINAL: 100/100. (MASTERPIECE)\n\nCONCLUSION: Rockstar North did it again... the best DLC's of the history untill the date... let's see what GTA V can do soon.","June 14, 2014","true","7.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

They spice up GTA IV and add many things that make it a great -and better- experience than the original.\n\nThe GFWL comments aren't without their reasons, but the game is certainly playable. The single player experience is awesome. I'm not even halfway through TBoGT at the 15hr mark. I haven't played TLaTD, but can't wait. The campaign missions are more creative, the new weapons are way too fun (Jackhammer with explosive rounds, anyone?) and each time I play it I can't wait to find out what kind of mess I'll get myself into.\n\nGTAIV was fun to free-roam in, but the added weapons, locations, and things to do make this one stand out. I haven't tried multiplayer, so I can't offer an opinion regarding that.\n\nAll-in-all, pick it up on sale, you'll have a lot of fun, regardless of what you think of GFWL.","January 13, 2015","true","30.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Just about the best value you could hope for. Two full length games in one. And GTA4 games at that.\nRuns slightly better on my system than GTA4 too, which is a bonus. New radio stations are nice, new vehicles and weapons are excellent, and the new stories are very well written, acted and told.\nAs per usual you find it impossible to feel anything for the character you play, as they are both just scuzzy criminals with no morals and would kill their best friends for money, even though they keep going on about how important friends are.\nGay Tony is by far the best of the two, with an awesome new helicopter gunship, and a fantastic auto-shotgun with explosive ammo that smashes vehicles to peices with each shot. Hilarity obviously ensues when you do this to a police car.\nI havent played MP yet, but it seems to be just the same thing as in GTA4, so if you liked that you will like this.\nAll in all a great game.","December 27, 2010","true","69.5"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Still, one of the least enjoyable experiences I had in a long time. Only bothered with Lost and the Damned - however, Rockstar royally ♥♥♥♥ed up that awesome setting. You can't go wrong with bikes, booze and bad attitude can you? Well, you can if you bring the most unlikeable, stupid S.O.B.s into the mix - having them engage in a stupid as hell story that feels so artificial and contrived it should pretty much insult about anybody that ever read a book. There is no rhyme or reason to anything happening to Johnny the Jew or his fellow easy riders and never in my life have I wished so bad to take control of a characters decisions because Johnny is NOT able to make any sensible or wise choices, like AT ALL. And it goes way south quickly from the initial dumb ideas this bald-headed bozo cooks up. A trainwreck that "tells you how it is with these here biker-types stuck in the 60's" - all with a unhealthy amount of cliché and gritty hyper-realism attached. It's all satire and parody - my ♥♥♥, son!\n\nAnd don't even get me started on the actual gameplay, UI, or the performance on my rig that, considering this game looks really dated, was amazingly bad. If you enjoy this mess, we are most assuredly not looking eye to eye when it comes to games. TLAD is a waste of ♥♥♥♥ing time and I need to complete Tim Schafer's "Full Throttle" at least  a dozen times to get this stinker out of the system and restore my respect for leather-clad outlaws on wheels of steel.","November 7, 2013","false","10.5"," 4 of 11 people (36%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","36","4","11","0","0"

Whats more the graphics look someone was drawing while taking a s*&% and their inspiration was the product of their trip to the bathroom. So just wait for GTA V which hopefully won't be a really bad PC port.\n","October 10, 2014","false","1.0"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

Not only that, the graphics and general smoothness surpassed that of the console version long ago. I was pleasantly surprised to play this game WITHOUT any modifications or hot fixes to make it run correctly.\n\nWhen I started playing TLAD and entered the Lost clubhouse, I found a biker cracked out on the couch half dead. 10/10\n\nBut seriously, buy this game if your computer can support it.

It brought many new features into the already amazing GTA 4, new features consisting of New Radio Stations, New Weapons, Parachute, Vehicles, Night Clubs & Dancing etc... The storyline itself was excellent it tied in perfectly with the GTA 4 Setting and it was amazing seeing how they interconnected, the protagonist himself is quite awesome, he has a big heart and also gets his hands dirty if necessary, Tony's character is also great to watch because your basically his babysitter and best friend. All the characters you interact with are memorable especially the protagonist and Tony, the missions themself are fun & entertaining to play.\n\nOverall TBOGT improved upon the fabulous GTA 4 in every way. The Gameplay is fun and will bring many hours of entertainment, The Story is Beautiful and fun to play out. I enjoyed this game from start to finish, and the freeroam has been entertaining aswell.\n\nIn the end, I would highly Reccommend GTA Liberty City Episodes, TBOGT Is a beautiful GTA 4 DLC that is a must have for any GTA Fan.","January 8, 2015","true","21.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
