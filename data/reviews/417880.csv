The developers know how to tell a story.\n- Great voice acting. Every character sounds like a real, relatable human being.\n- Great map design\n- Great graphics.\n- Great music and overall sound design. The soundtrack contains some of the most beautiful and atmospheric music I've ever heard in a video game.\n\nCONS:\n- Inconsistent framerate issues, even with the settings turned down (using an R9 290X, 16GB ddr4 RAM and i5 6500) - I'd go from the mid 50's one second to mid 20's the next.\n\n- No puzzle solving whatsoever or any other feature to let you interact with the world (aside from opening doors and turning on radios). It's a walking simulator through and through.\n\n- ZERO replay value. Seriously, there is nothing that would ever bring me back to this game - there are no alternate endings (that I know of) or any other kind of player-made decisions to change the course of events in any kind of way. It has a single story to tell, it tells it, and that's that.\n\n- The game's ending is practically insulting to its audience.\n\nI'd only recommend this game when it's on sale. And when I say "sale" I mean when it's 70% off or lower. You could easily finish this game in an afternoon and you may or may not be left with an empty feeling after its finale.

For the most part, the game IS a walking simulator, yet in addition to that, it allows the player to be able to interact with various objects (computers, phones, televisions, etc.) and trails of light which illuminate scenes where characters engage with each other in order to lead the story forward.\nThe player will find themselves in control of an unnamed, unseen (first-person) protagonist and begin slowly walking around a quiet English village called Yaughton, to unravel the mystery behind the dissappreance of its inhabitans.\nThe rest of the journey will only be your own experience to go, without spoiling from my part ...\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=672080024\n~ Visually captivating and outstanding writing.\n'Everything is light now, everything has come to rest. We have each other, We lived apart from them; we understand now. Our failure to touch, to belong. But it doesn’t matter anymore. Everybody is gone, and we will join them. We are born apart, driftwood on the banks of an endless dark ocean. And we will be carried away by the swell soon enough. But in between, in a single day of living… that dancing in a strip of sunlight, we can find what we miss. The love that makes us whole. The imminence. Everybody found their other. This pattern is mine.'\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=671473362\n~ Excellent voice acting with a haunting soundtrack;\nPerhaps one of the most memorable I’ve come across so far. At the beginning or end of a chapter, or during pivotal scenes where some crucial bit of information is revealed, climaxes are punctuated by soaring pieces of classical and choral music that last well into the afterglow.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geAnnlZMngI\n\n- Inconsistent gameplay due to heavy performance issues, low frame rates\n- Slow 'walking' pace makes the game drag after a while and less enjoyable\n- Incomprehensible navigation\n- little interactions\n\nIn a general aspect, it is NOT a 'everyones' type of game/genre but more than likely an experience.\nGet yourself an insight of this game first before considering buying it and complain afterwards. It'll save you money and nerves.\nFor me personally, Everybody’s Gone to the Rapture is a wonderfully poignant, moving sci-fi and story-driven journey. A fully realized world, excellent writing, superb voice acting, beautiful music, and a compelling, intriguing mystery are more than worth a few technical difficulties and some subpar mechanics.\n\n\nVerdict: 7 out of 10","April 24","true","30.7"," 105 of 156 people (67%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","67","105","156","5","5"

About 2 hours in, and it's all mostly negative I'm afraid. On the negative side:\n-Walk speed is too slow (this from someone who never uses the run function in open world games)\n-Mouse sensitivity is way too low, even on the maximum in-game slider level\n-Run is this weird 'hold Shift for a few seconds to slowly build up speed' thing, that is not explained in-game (and of course as soon as you take your finger off Shift, you stop running)\n-When I say 'run', I mean a slightly faster trot than walking - 'run' speed is very slow in this game and I think calling it running is false advertising\n-You can't run indoors, and walking speed indoors is even slower than outdoors\n-No map, too easy to get lost. Game tries to compensate for this by putting map on notice boards in-game, but this is useless, as it is an overview map, with no landmarks to orientate yourself\n-Weird brightness changes (so stand in one spot, and after some time, the game will just darken, and if you move around, will magically lighten again, as if clouds have passed in front of the sun - but there is no in-game weather cycle, so it isn't this)\n-Weird ball of light follows you around - you can't interact with it, and game doesn't explain what the ♥♥♥♥ it is meant to do (it just seems to randomly appear, and then fly away and vanish - and you can't keep up with it to see if it goes anywhere as the walking speed is way too slow)\n-Hardly any interactivity - only a small number of items can be interacted with, so you can't pick stuff up and examine it etc\n-No zoom function - so you can't zoom in on objects to get a better look at them (read text on in-game notices etc)\n-The gates and doors open towards you, rather than away from you as in most other games - meaning you are always being thrust out of the way by a moving door or gate\n-No manual save, and checkpoints are way too far apart. Prior to writing this review, I was trying to find a savepoint so I could exit the game without losing all my progress. The game does tell you how long ago you saved when you try and exit, and according to it, it had been almost an hour since I last found a savepoint (these are random, there is no physical save point you can move to and stand in to save, you just have to wait until the game shows the 'saving' icon\n-The 'tuning' mechanism when you encounter the stationery balls of light is not explained in-game, and the stupid on-screen indicator confuses the situation even more\n-Maybe why the mouse sensitivity is so low in-game - when you look left or right, there some stuttering and other weird effects. If you have a mouse with a variable DPI setting - as I do - you find this effect is worse the higher DPI you set your mouse (I set DPI higher to compensate for the awfully low turn speed - game devs probably realised this as a problem, and rather than fixing it, simply made the turning speed so low that they hoped no one would notice)\nOn the plus side:\n-It looks nice\n-The game tells you when you last saved when you try and exit, nice for knowing how much progress you are going to lose because you can't find one of the random and very sparsely populated checkpoint save spots\nOverall, very, very disappointed, and frankly, no idea if I am actually tempted to even finish the game. The big issues are the lack of a map (so you have no clue where you are), the criminal lack of savepoints, and the awful walking speed. The lack of interactivity except for a small number of objects is a big disappointment in a walking sim.","April 16","false","1.7"," 160 of 248 people (65%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","65","160","248","5","9"

This never happens. Games have a long way to go still.\n\nBut Everybody's Gone to the Rapture is one of the most beautiful digital experiences I've ever had.\n\nThe 'omg I might be welling up with emotion' point didn't occur during a scripted sequence, plot twist or revelatory event. No, my noticable emotional response happened somewhere in rural England in the empty household of a missing person, staring at a perfectly ordinary kitchen table, when suddenly the whole game- the world, the music, the setting, mood, sounds, the bumble bees- bloody EVERYTHING genuinely *got* to me.\n\nThe game is totally alien in design. You walk slowly. You look at stuff. You don't do a lot. And then... you realise that actually, yes you do. You *do* do a lot. You do so much in fact that I am in absolute awe of how every single aspect- even the shonky, radio drama quality of the dialogue - comes together in such a considered way.\n\nThis is a masterpiece of game design.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/falfa/recommended/417880/","falfa","Falfa","http://steamcommunity.com/id/falfa/","107 products in account","I bought this game mainly because of the setting - 1980's England.  I was thinking it would be an interesting game to walk around in such a time and experience such a story.  But for me after the initial joy of walking around the village it became rather detached and dull.  I understand it is game based on the rapture, so finding people is unlikely task I will complete.  But by walking around (painfully slow) and just listening to people’s lives.  There isn't that two-way communication like the other isolated style game of Firewatch.  I assumed with a rapture based game there would at least a few 'left behind' if this was indeed going to be a rapture in the biblical sense, but it wasn't.  The music was lovely, the graphics excellent, but I felt very detached from the game.  More like watching a TV programme than being in it.  And I would recommend anyone interested in this game just looking on YouTube on one of the many ‘Let’s Play…’ videos.  It will be the same thing.\nI do hope the game developers continue with the 1980’s England theme in another game, I really do.  I would love to see perhaps a murder-mystery (maybe even a bit like Hot Fuzz!) or perhaps some cold war conspiracy similar to Tinker Tailor Solider Spy or the Fourth Protocol.\nGreat setting, with great atmosphere but that soon wears off and you feel very detached, confused and tired with all the walking.\nIn the end I got a refund, but looked online for the end.

I do agree the walking/slightly faster walking (run) controls are too slow and the developers shouldn't assume the player  should have to crawl around to be able to take the environment in, I found myself wanting to backtrack and check out other details but not feeling particularly bothered to due to the time it takes to move around so it feels by trying to force the player to take the environments in by slowing their movement down it's having more of an opposite effect where it makes you give up wanting to recheck or go to that building in the distance.\n\nBeing primarily an environment artist I found the world to be quite beautiful (perhaps being an artist I can appreciate games more focused on the visuals of an environment), performance wise I was reaching 50-60fps which I don't mind at all- perhaps some people should just turn the fps counter off, if your mind knows it's running at a particular fps it will become more obsessed with moaning about it. Whilst it can be annoying for people with medium spec machines, look at what you are trying to get your machine to run- maxing out the settings is giving you visuals that should only be run on a high spec machine (don't bring a Ford Fiesta to an Formula 1 race). I tested on a development machine with no hitches and a medium spec with barely any stutter at all, so if you are experiencing any performance issues try lowering your settings to something your machine is more capable of running smoothly (although it's beautiful temporal anti-aliasing can be costly and lowering the mesh detail can help).\n\nAll in all, I would recommend a play of this- it's something to relax with and enjoy when you want a quiet stroll through an english village. It might not be everything it could have been (lack of interactivity breaks the immersion at times) but it's worth it if you want to experience a story and world at a more leisurely pace.","April 19","true","9.1"," 47 of 77 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","47","77","0","1"

While it sure looks and sounds absolutely beautiful, the story and gameplay parts just didn’t work at all for me.\n\nThe biggest problem I had with the storytelling, was that at no point did I care for any of the villagers or what happened to them. You get a pretty good idea what has happed during the first minutes of the game, the rest is the game trying to tell you through the individual character storylines why and how things happened. For me these storylines felt completely bland.\n\nWhen it comes to gameplay, in a nutshell it consists of you as a bodiless camera floating around triggering various cut scenes. This could work fine if the story was interesting, but in this case is further hampered by the camera movement speed (or the lack of it) and the run button, which seemed to work randomly and even when working didn’t really help that much. This just felt so frustrating and stopped me from really exploring around.\n\nSo, in the end I kept playing only to reach the end and be done with the game, and even the ending managed to disappoint somewhat, as it didn’t really add that much to the story.","April 30","false","6.0"," 20 of 31 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","20","31","0","0"

THIS game is too slow to be called a "Walking simulator" ..  seriously ive seen continents drift quicker !  There is a "RUN" button but its actually a brisk walk pace and it doesn't work most of the time.  I was frustrated because this is deliberate on the part of the developers and its absolutely unessessary.  The steam achievements are less than ambitious..  one is "wrong number"  waiting for a phone call !!!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/klarden/recommended/417880/","klarden","Kain Klarden","http://steamcommunity.com/id/klarden/","1232 products in account","Everybody's Gone to the Rapture had a weird road to take. Prototyped 4 years ago as a PC game about the world ending, and playable hero having a limited amount of time to do whatever they think they can or should do before the world ends it ended up being much closer to the first The Chinese Room's project - Dear Esther. And, to be completely honest with you, despite loving Esther (and Pigs), I was sad to hear that Rapture will abandon the original plan. Afraid to see that Rapture will overstay the welcome of less interactive games and have a cold reception and, well, be simply much more boring then Esther was. In a few ways, I was right to be afraid. But mostly, Rapture is a huge "this is how it's done" lesson on how to make a beautiful theatrical touching story with little to no interaction, which, at the same time, simply wouldn't work in any other medium, other than games.\n\nSo let's start with the beautiful - the game looks and sounds fantastic. The art design, the details, the huge map of a small town and it's surroundings is phenomenal. There's just one loading screen - right as you start the game, and everything afterwards is just a huge map with outdoor and some indoor areas, full of details and beautiful things. All of which also sound amazing. Sound design, voice acting and music, oh the music, are all top notch. Soundtrack sounds good outside the game, but in game it's not just good, it's simply perfect. And, as always, slightly overtly poetic and intentionally slightly (and sometimes very) theatric prose in the script completes the game, makes it work together. It's a rather simple, yet very clever and intriguing story about love, in all of the meanings of the word. And as a story it manages to be both a melodrama, a thriller and even a horror story that would fit some philosophical episode of The Twilight Zone.\n\nSadly, there are bad things too. The thing that is simply not great for PC version specifically, is the optimisation. Thankfully, it can still be resolved in the future, as even while the game looks like it deserves to be very hardware hungry, even the developers acknowledge that they weren't able to optimise it for PC as good as they could at the time the publisher decided to release the game. So future patches might solve this issue nicely. The only truly bad thing with the game itself, though, is the walking speed. While I fully undestand the lack of jump, as it's hard to take a story seriously when you bunnyhop everywhere, I do not understand the logic behind the run button in th released version of the game. Initial plans indicated a very Mirror's Edge-like concept of character simply building momentum as they walk, but in the final release, the game has a run button, and that run button simply doesn't work in many spots, and that's an apparently intended feature. Moreover, in some closed spaces your walk speed from normal goes to extremely slow. And that's really really bad for a game with huge environments to explore, because as a player you can hit the point when you DON'T want to explore in the game all about exploration. Because it will be too slow, and you can get into a dead end and need to go back etc. I'm hoping this too will be rebalanced in the future, because the current solution simply hurts the enjoyment a player can get out of the game.\n\nBut overall, it's still atmospheric, beautiful and unique. I'd still say that at least some of the original ideas could've been more fun to see - after all, we've seen examples of much uglier games' environments and characters feel very much alive with games like Deadly Premonition or Sylvio, just due to clever use of gameplay elements. But as is, Everybody's Gone to the Rapture is something you really need to experience.","May 26","true","6.9"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

A brilliant use of the Cryengine gives a believable segment of the English countryside and the aftermath of a mysterious incident. With eerily abandoned buildings, lush fields and picturesque woods accompanied by strange lights and one of the best music scores and audio around you explore the story of the valley and it's inhabitants at your own relaxed pace. Piecing together the fragments of peoples lives to find out what happened and what made them who they were makes is a masterpiece of interactive storytelling.\n\nIt's no shooter, you don't run but it has more emotion and soul than any game of CoD or Battlefield. It's not about framerate either, it runs excellently on my 2 year old kit as you don't need steady 60fps to enjoy it, heck films are 24fps and they work. Enjoy the beauty.

In my mind the term "game" implies playability which in turn implies some form of mental input.  This "game" is more of an interactive video. But I do use the term interactive dubiously as it only just fulfills this criteria.  I guess (without checking), that it took me less than 10 hours to get from one end of the game to the other and although I have appartently only completed 18% of the game, the rest is extremely uninviting.  One achievement asks that I attempt to open all the locked caravan doors on the caravan site, how very, very dull!  I don't see any appeal in this at all.  This may be a critique from the developers about the state of modern gaming, which I kinda get but at the same time I want to collect lots  of lollipops, rocks, chop down trees but have no desire to endlessly try to open locked doors, one has a purpose, the other does not.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/paperbackjacket/recommended/417880/","paperbackjacket","Ryan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/paperbackjacket/","339 products in account","Like it's predecessor, Dear Esther, I have trouble calling Everybody's Gone to the Rapture a game, per se. It's more of a walking simulator, with the first installment in the pseudo-series (Esther) as the prototypical, and thus perhaps archetypal, example of such a genre. While I thoroughly enjoyed Rapture, it does have a few problems.\n\nOriginally released on the PS4, the Steam iteration is a port. Thus, there are some parts that simply don't work as well as intended. I had a lot of trouble figuring out how to actually PLAY the game, as the controls aren't explained very well -- especially the storyline's "main events" (which require one to rotate the controller on a PS4, but hold down a trigger while sliding the analog stick on the XBox controller when playing on my PC). There are also a few other problems, like the walk speed being too slow (which stands as a common complaint). I understand the response to this is "well, it IS a walking simulator..." so perhaps I'm misunderstanding, but the slow speed meant getting the achievements was... quite tedious.\n\nAh, yes. The achievements. As many of you who have read my others reviews know, I love achievements and earning them. This game has a few creative ones, but for the most part, its achievements mostly fall into one of two camps: 1) Go somewhere and wait BUT CAN YOU FIGURE OUT EXACTLY WHERE IT IS YOU NEED TO WAIT?? or 2) Find random items in the world, but you don't know how many of that item there are and there's no indication when you've "found" one of them. So yes, they're quite annoying. Add the slow walking speed to that for a truly frustrating gaming experience.\n\nWhile those sins would be enough to damn most games, I feel compelled to positively recommend Everybody's Gone to the Rapture. Perhaps this is my endearing fondness for Esther shining through, but there are many positive qualities I feel many reviewers tend to overlook in this game. The music (oh man, the MUSIC!) is aboslutely phenomenal; Jessica Curry, the composer, is a wonderful human being and has absolutely nailed another perfect soundtrack. The graphics are exceedingly beautiful (though perhaps the port is a bit poorly optimized -- my monster computer had random framerate drops the like of which I've never seen). The environment is spectacular and immersive, so much so that it makes me want to travel to rural England to see such beautiful sights with my own eyes.\n\nI guess, at the end of the day, Rapture is a beautiful but flawed game. The Chinese Room, for whom this game is no doubt a labor of love, are definitely a studio to watch for those who dig narrative-driven experiences. I hope the negative qualities which I touched upon influence their future games, which I will no doubt buy -- and you should too! Rapture is a great game... Just perhaps one you should buy on sale. And try to not get TOO frustrated while achievement hunting! ;)","May 25","true","36.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Also if you are British that adds to the experience about 10,000x when you see a red telephone box in HD textures and a pub which sells pie for 50p. I know right?! 50p I wish, if only we could go back in time.\n\nSo I just completed this game and I have to say it was an interesting experience and overall I thoroughly enjoyed it. There are undoubtedely some issues but I think these are more down to personal preference than actual problems.\n\nThe game focuses around 6 characters and their individual experiences in the world. Throughout my playtime I explored enough to encover a decent amount of each storyline but I was still left with some questions. Despite this I think the themeing and storyline are very unique and reward the player for being observant and interested in their surroundings.\n\nGameplay wise we can all complain about the lack of a sprint button and the general slow paced feel of the game but when you buy a 'Walking Simulator' do you really expect to be sprinting around? We are probably a middle aged, unfit man with no capacity to run, give the guy a break. Apart from this I spent a couple hours at the beginning of the game scouring every house - do not do this. Follow the orb for directions and then deviate from the path to find extra story elements.\n\nOH MY JEEEEEEEEEEEEE the graphics are dank. Many people seem to be complaining about optimisation issues however I didn't encounter any so I suppose I am lucky. Every model in this game seems hand crafted and beautiful. The houses are visceral and seem part of the world while little particle details like dustmotes add even more to the atmosphere. If you want a game just for graphics then buy this and you will not be disappointed.\n\nFinally we come to the soundtrack. I must say I preferred the 'Vanishing of Ethan Carter's' gloomy and spooky music but there is one song about corn which is just amazing. I instantly wanted to be a farmer and abandon my life as a student to tend to the fields. Trust me this soundtrack is suberb and never seems to repeat itself!\n\nIn conclusion I think this game is brilliant and if anything just needs some optimisation and perhaps an overhall of the grass textures which look pretty 2D. If you are just reading this conclusion, read the rest. I am dumb and cannot structure writing well :)\n","May 13","true","7.0"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","2"

Let me tell you; it turned out to be all I hoped it would be, and more.\n\nAs you mosey on through a small quaint English town, a story is being told. It quickly becomes clear some disaster has taken place, but it has left no trace other than all of the town's inhabitants vanishing mysteriously. You follow after as the silent spectator, seeing visions of what has happened before. I found the story quite inriguing and -if you pay attention to the details- it's fun to see the environment reflect the things you see and hear in the visions. A lot of thought was put into this and it shows.\n\nThe graphics are the best I have ever seen in any game, period. Previoulsy, 'The Vanishing of Ethan Carter' held this title. The graphical splendor comes at a price however; with my GTX970 I get ~25-30fps running the game at 1440p with all setting on max. For me, that's smooth enough. We're not playing a competitive shooter here, nobody in this little town warrants a 360 no-scope headshot. This is a game where you grab your xbox/steam controller, lean back and enjoy the experience. I'm sad to see so many people letting the experience pass them by because they feel the optimization is too poor.\n\nThe musical score is beautiful and fits each scene well. Think every type of classical music and big choirs, really driving home the more moving moments of the game. They really went all out with it and this alone is worth what Chinese Room is asking for the game. The voice acting is also faultless.\n\nTldr; Wonderful game. Worth every penny. Great graphics. Great music. Insta-buy if you liked 'Dear Esther'. Stay away if you think just walking around is boring and if you're sensitive to low fps.\n\nThank you Chinese Room for also bringing this to PC and thank you for another beautiful, memorable game.","May 23","true","9.2"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/asfdaserreww/recommended/417880/","asfdaserreww","Paul_Wacker","http://steamcommunity.com/id/asfdaserreww/","110 products in account","I can see how this game could be quite polarizing, depending on the audience.  As with all games, I think that if the player knows what the game is going to contain before they purchase it, they can adequatly judge whether or not they will enjoy it.\n\nEverybody's Gone to the Rapture contains a splendid story.  Not just the superficial story that takes place during the events of the game.  This story is well written in and of itself.  However the game leads you, the player, to a possibility that opens up a much grander story.\n\nTo tell this story the game utilizes well done voice acting.  The Bioshock style recordings are left all over so you can piece together the plot on your own.  The music is also quite striking, though I don't think it's the kind of music most people will be listening to in their car every day of the week.  It's much more of an 'epic' soundtrack.\n\nAs far as gameplay goes, however, the game is a walking simulator.  You can walk and activate recordings, that's just about it.  A common complaint, and one that I will echo, is that the walking seems to slow.  I'm okay with the idea of a walking simulator, but I still think the player should be able to choose, to some degree, how fast they walk.  You either walk or jog (if you hold down the sprint button) in this game, and both are exceedingly slow.  I understand that the slow speed is arguably to force the player to experience the atmosphere.  Even so I think movement could have been a bit faster without sacrificing the experience.\n\nSpeaking of the atmosphere, the CryEngine is used to beautiful effect in this game.  The town and woods surrounding it are rendered beautifully.  This being a CryEngine game, like Crysis, it will tax your computer.  You will probably not be running Ultra details at 90fps.  I personally don't think this is a problem; this is a walking simulator.  I don't care if it drops to 30fps, all I'm doing is plodding around town examining empty homes and gas stations.  I'm not making frame-perfect reactionary shots or anything.\n\nThe Walking Dead got critical acclaim for being a story driven video game.  Everybody's Gone to the Rapture is another story driven game, but the story is told in a different manner.  If you want a good story, and don't need a bunch of action, I would recommend this game.  I'm glad Sony decided to produce this game, I think the developer put the resources to good use.","May 19","true","7.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

This is the slow movement from Beethoven's Pastoral Symphony, not Symphony of Destruction by Megadeth. It felt like being in the kind of dreams I have when I've read too much John Wyndham. It's slow, intriguing and beautiful. A trascendental dream, it is. A blast, it is not.\n\nThe story set in an English village owes a lot to John Wyndham and this is to the game's credit. Move slowly from house to house piecing together the story in an other-wordly setting. The village feels and looks breath-takingly convincing. The graphics are superb.\n\nOn the downside very few of the objects in the world allow you to interact and there is nothing to actually "do". I never thought I would say this in a game and I understand how saying this out loud sounds kind of odd. But I'm not saying it out loud I'm typing it so I'll say it anyway - this game isn't really about "doing things". If you're interested in actually "doing things" you might prefer pretty much any other game in existence (with the possible exception of Big Rigs). But if you like walking very slowly round an atmospheric village looking at things and bumping into invisible walls and getting frustrated that you can't pick up that thing over there and why am I wasting my life playing this and - oh my god that thing that just happened was the most beautiful thing that ever happened in any game I've played and the music and all my hair's standing on end and everything.\n\nThis isn't really like any other game I've played. It isn't even like Big Rigs. It's slow and it's beautiful and it's a work of art and it's £15 and it's in my gaming library and should be in yours too.\n\nBe gentle with it and it will love you back.","April 16","true","9.3"," 38 of 79 people (48%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","48","38","79","5","2"

The musical score, story and voice acting are all superb.\nIf your English then imagine a really interesting episode of "The Archers" or a non-comedy episode of "Dirk Gently" (both are radio shows) and you have an idea of the production quality of the story and voice acting, which lend themselves to feeling like you're actually listening to a radio show.\n\nThe game isn't perfect however, rather poor performance at highest/high graphics settings on a decent rig (8core CPU @ 5Ghz, 16GB DDR2400, 980Ti, 512GB SSD).\nThe time of day changes as you move between scenes/areas can be very janky and easily break immersion for short periods too.\nAlmost every building/house/area looks far too clean to have ever been lived in, never mind after being left for x hours/days/weeks since the raputure occurred.\n\nEver since Dear Esther i have wanted something similar but on a much grander scale, Rapture has certainly scratched that itch, but (and maybe it's because im English and have wandered many a countryside village) after it ended i was left a tiny bit dissapointed at the lack of any caves or hidden nooks and crannies, actual places that make you go "oooooh" like dear esther did, rather than just relying on the detail and advanced graphics.\n\nOverall i can reccomend this game to people who already know they enjoy walking sims, this is the best there is and any/all negative points i have made above are because i wanted to write a balanced review and not just gush about the 5 hours i spent in game :D\n\nIf you've never been completely sold on walking sims then this would be the one over all else that could possibly change your mind, especially if you like being told a good story where you feel like your peicing it together yourself, but you'll probably feel like you paid more than you should.\n\nTL/DR:\nLove walking sims? Then this is highly reccomended even at full price.\nNot so fond of walking sims but like the look/story of Rapture?

It tells a stunning story, and you can really immerse yourself in it.\n\nThe walking and exploration sometimes is a little slow and discourages you from exploring absolutely everything, but so much detail has been poured into the environment that it's a waste to rush through the story arc. However the story is cryptic at times, but you can link events together as you come across more of them, and in general it's a pretty great story.\n\nThe soundtrack is always great, Jessica Curry is second to none (I purchased it on vinyl before the game was even released on PC).\n\nIf you enjoyed Dear Esther, you'll love it.","April 20","true","4.6"," 5 of 13 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","5","13","0","0"

However you are often drawn to certain areas by visual or audio cues (light trails or a shift in sound to church bells ringing for example) to give you a nudge without forcibly dragging you by the hand.\n\nThe original score and sound direction also complements the events perfectly and are well used to enhance the atmosphere.\n\nAlthough valid gameplay criticisms can be raised at it (slow walking pace, lack of minimap/menu screen map etc), the majority of these I feel are down to artistic choices to aid the immersion.\nThe 'focussing' mechanic for some of dialog can be a little frustrating initially, but there is an option to simplify this.\n\nI had no issues performance-wise on high settings with a mid-range PC (i5-2500, 16GB RAM, R9 270x), although I note the lack of quick save is a shame as the autosaves are quite sparse.\n\nEverybody's gone to the Rapture is worth the asking price for the general attention to detail and care put into crafting the environment alone.","April 16","true","7.7"," 4 of 11 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","4","11","0","0"

No part of the environment feels like a copy and paste job, everything is unique and helps ground the story. It won't be for everyone but many of its criticisms miss the point - this is an experience rather than a pure game.

You start off not having any idea of what’s going on. There is a ball of light that moves around, and you can follow it to places, or you can just choose to take your own path and explore.\n\nThe story focuses entirely on learning about the characters and their interactions with each other. Everything is told through either conversations between animated light or audio logs. The animated light characters was an interesting idea, and it was certainly intriguing, but I think I still would have preferred seeing the characters. The story, much like the walking speed, feels too slow paced. I found it took quite a bit of time for me to really get excited about the story or any of the characters, unlike The Vanishing of Ethan Carter which had me hooked the whole way through.\n\nPros:the graphics are so detailed and elegant - there’s so much beauty to appreciate and it's very impressive!\nthe voice acting is on point, the soundtrack is amazing, the sound effects are absolutely fantastic\nall of the audio and visuals are done exceptionally well, and it really makes you feel like you’re IN nature and everything fits so well into the game, and really gives you that immersive atmosphere\nCons:'sprint' is not really sprinting like you know it in most games, as it is still incredibly slow, and causes the game to feel TOO slow paced, which has the potential to deter exploration\nthe story is also slow paced, and it can take a while to really get excited about it\nhigh system requirements to play at decent quality settings with 45-60 FPS\nlacks replay value unless you just want to soak in the beauty or complete achievements\nEverybody’s Gone to the Rapture took me a bit less than 4 hours to complete, however, this is mostly due to the fact that in the game you walk so damn slow… If the game had a normal sprint feature, you could probably finish it in half the time. I understand that the game is a walking simulator focused on exploring and admiring the beauty, but the fact that the pace was so incredibly slow, it actually deterred me from wanting to explore more because it took way too long to get anywhere. Normally, I love exploring and collecting things, but it was so painfully slow that I just couldn’t be bothered.\n\nWhile this game is certainly immersive and beautiful, this game is not for everyone. The slow pacing of the game overall, and the fairly high system requirements might turn a lot of people off. However, if you have well above the recommended specs, and are looking for a relaxing slow-paced atmospheric walking simulator, then this is a solid purchase - at a sale price.","April 15","true","4.5"," 22 of 51 people (43%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","43","22","51","2","0"

I'm pretty tired of open world kill everything games(but I still play them because they usually have the best graphics). The graphics are nice. I'm playing it on very high settings @ 2k & 1080p on two different systems. 4k brings my fps down to 20-30 and only marginally looks better than 2k. Graphically many are saying great things but I feel its not quite up to the hype I've read. My currrent basis of comparisons are Witcher3, Rise of Tomb Raider, GTA V. It is beautifil but not all textures are equal and some really look like old DX9.0a while others are full on DX11. I really think gamma/brightness controlls would help here. I hope they'll add SLI support as this engine is still very demanding because, regardless of texture quality, the game is trying to render a lot of things.\n\nI don't want the dev's to feel bad about this port. Its a great game and a lot of fun to explore and experience. That's what its really about. Having played all the Crysis games many, many, many times, I think I'm familiar with what Crytek's engines can do and I'm always wanting more(Crysis 4?!?). The game is reasonably priced but you will need some strong but basic hardware to get the most NVIDIA(No SLI/Physx) wise, it does seem more optimized toward AMD but that makes sense considering its origin.\n\nA good game, I don't regret it, could be better optimized. Great concept/story.\n\n","April 15","true","3.9"," 7 of 20 people (35%) found this review helpful","35","7","20","0","0"

I am a sucker for any deep story game and this one has so much to it. Considering it's open world, it gives me the player to take my time and explore every ounce of detail that this beautifully constructed piece of art has to offer. Before I played, I listened to Jessica Curry's score over and over in complete awe of how it sounded. Now playing the game and listening to the music and sounds, it's just out of this world. I'm also a student at art school studying 3D animation, so seeing this game's lighting, modeling, textures, shadows, particles, JUST EVERYTHING IS GORGEOUS. And the little details with the particles leading the player to certain areas is such a nice touch. No not the AI lights, the actual light particles. But technicalities aside, if you really want to wind down after a long day, and just have an experience in a fiction English countryside that makes you wish you lived there, I HIGHLY recommend this to you.","April 14","true","6.4"," 12 of 34 people (35%) found this review helpful","35","12","34","0","0"

Just completed first playthrough of EGTTR... what an amazing concept. The graphics are just stunning, they maxed out my 980TI although apparently more optimisation is required but I didn't care when it got jerky occasionally as they were the best graphics I have EVER seen in a PC game... The cinematic music score is equally incredible and really rather haunting (best played on 7.1 headphones). This is not a game to rush through and there's no frantic action, more of a leisurely stroll exploring all the visual goodness that is available. The plot it pretty decent, still not sure I quite understand what happened here but I think that's kind of the point... Top tip - make sure you reach a save point before you quit though or you will lose your recent progress. If you want something you can dip into, lose an hour or two in a relaxing experience, this is definitely for you. That said, it does also build the tension quite nicely towards the end with the both the visual and audio atmosphere changing as the plot thickens. Is it the most exciting game I've ever played? No. Does it have the best graphics/audio score of anything I've played so far? Yes! Do I think it was money well spent, Yes. Would I buy it again/recommend it? Yes. Will I be playing it again. Yes! If you're in any doubt, just get it bought and give it a try, it does require some patience as it is NOT a fast paced game (although I believe a fast walk was availble on PS4 version, hopefully on this too) but to charge through it as fast as possible is to miss the point entirely...

There's a fix which enables Nvidia 3D Vision as well which makes it even more stunning. Loved this on the PS4, plays great on my PC as well. It is slow paced and there's no puzzles to solve, just a great story which you need to discover by exploring. Its not for everyone, but it can be a very emotional experence for those looking for something a bit different.","May 7","true","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

To sum up how decent my lappy is, I can play Fallout 4 on High settings with only shadows turned down to atleast medium or low and still squeeze out around 40fps. Reading some of the reviews I see that no matter what setting you put it on or how awesome your PC is, this game just refuses to run optimally.\n\nThe story seems decent enough from what I've read and experienced within my 5 minutes of playing. Wish there was a 'meh' recommendation button on here because that is exactly what the game is. Meh. I don't necessarly NOT recommend it but I wouldn't buy it at it's full price. Wait till there's a really good sale on it.","June 6","true","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
