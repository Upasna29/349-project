Designed for smart-phones and ported to PCs, this game is a failure. It's not the subject matter that bothers me (aside from my dislike of zombies), it's the fact that the Fist of Jesus is poorly-designed, broken, and just plain unfun.\n\nThis game is divided into numerous short stages. There's typically some goal you have to achieve, like killing a certain number of zombies and/or getting a high enough score. For the most part all you really need to do is shut your brain off and press buttons. Like any poor beatemup, Fist of Jesus tends to be a mashathon. The mechanics are incredibly sloppy; some of the worst I've seen in the genre. J&J can get hit as long as they're close and facing the enemy, nevermind if they're far above or below them.\n\nLike any "good" Android/IOS game, Fist of Jesus has a lot of meaningless grinding. You can level up J&J's punching abilities and their health, but they don't make a difference. Enemies tend to do and take the same amount of damage regardless. Bonuses are awarded upon level-up, but they're incredibly minor like -5% damage from bosses and -5% speed of the divine punishment.\n\nAs the game progresses, you're actually expected to turn your brain back on for the "No-Hit" stages. Yes, a game that I just described as having "some of the worst (mechanics) I've seen in the genre" expects the player to complete stages without getting hit. I should've known this would happen. At first it's not actually that bad, since J & J have special abilities like fire and explosions to keep everyone away. However, the game decides this wasn't bullsshit* enough so they force divine punishments on you. Divine punishments are basically fatalities, once you stun an enemy (this is random) you can finish them off with a properly-timed button-press.\n\nLet me explain the point where I quit the game:\nOne stage forced me to divinely punish seven gun-toting zombies without getting hit. I was shot by a zombie facing the wrong direction. It was the most absurd thing to ever happen to me in a game. Was this the magical bullet that traveled around the world to hit me in the back? It's as logical an explanation as any other.\n\nSo...yeah. This is a broken game that shouldn't be bothered with.\n\n\n\n*Usually I'd just let the censors do their thing, but I hated this game so much.","January 18, 2015","false","5.3"," 49 of 65 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","49","65","0","0"

I know it's a game but are the developers trying to mock christians for this?\n\nFrom the graphics and gameplay, It's not worth the price since it's just another action game wherein you keep pressing the same button and use the same characters. The controls are easy and you'll be pressing it the whole game aside from a.s.w.d.The sounds are pretty much repetitive and actually fits the game.\n\nSo going back on the line "trying to mock christians" the developers used Judas & Jesus for an action game.

This is a shallow and simple beat ‘em up game that doesn’t take itself too seriously and it definitely shows. Throwing with fish, performing Kame’s (remember Dragon Ball Z’s Kamehameha’s ? Well, it’s just like that), smacking enemies with legs; it’s all part of the silliness.\n\nBut being silly doesn’t automatically make it a good game. As a matter of fact Fist Of Jesus is only fun for a short while. The only thing you do (and will do) is kill enemies with your bare hands. Well, mostly. As I mentioned you can also use special powers or kill enemies with weapons and limbs. Don’t worry, Jesus (or Judas (you can play with both, and switch between them with the press of a button) won’t tear off any limbs himself. But you’re fighting off zombies so you’ll occasionally see a leg lying on the floor which can then be used as a weapon.\nKilling enemies will earn you money, if you pick it up, which can be used to upgrade your characters after a battle, or before a battle in the form of a weapon you can take with you. Anyway, you have the obvious upgrades like more health and more strength but you can also unlock new powers. Unlocking a new power will allow you to go to a training level to see how it works. But, and this has already happened to me twice; the controls are not always explained. So it took a while for me to figure out what to do. This is just terrible and it’ll cost the game a few points.\nBut to get back to the special powers; Judas will be able to summon falling stars and Jesus will be able to create bread (for healing) or to create powerful explosions around him. There’s more but you have to see these for yourself or else I’ll be spoiling the entire game for you.\nYou will also be able to execute enemies by pressing a button at the right time. You’ll then see a very boring and lame animation of, let’s say, Jesus pulling out a heart (which should actually be exciting, right ??).\nThis also isn’t a real sidescrolling beat ‘em up. Yes, you’ll be moving to your left and right but it’s all very limited. This is no Final Fight or Streets Of Rage. Enemies will approach you and it’s your job to defeat them. Sometimes these objectives are mixed up so that you have to beat a certain amount of minibosses or survive until the time’s up, or survive and earn a certain amount of points.\nSo there’s a bit of variety but it’s not enough to keep you interested for too long. I grew tired of the game within the hour and that’s because it all comes down to just killing enemies. Meh, been there, done that.\n\nThe 2D graphics are well done. The characters use enough animations, but more would’ve definitely been welcome. There’s plenty of detail to be found in the levels and the use of colors fits a game of this nature. The graphics are the best part of the game, but I’m not sure if that’s a compliment or not.\nI think the game’s musician didn’t quite know what music would fit a game like this and in a way it’s understandable but creating some sort of wild west tune with whistling in it makes no sense whatsoever (I know it’s supposed to be silly). And this is for the overworld, by the way. The actual battles use decent, more appropriate music, but it still doesn’t come close to what I’d expect from a game like this.\n\nI believe there are 60 levels or so, so if you are into old school beat ‘em up games then you might be able to complete this in an hour or 5 I think. I think even less, since every level takes only a few minutes to complete but I’m not sure how hard it gets near the end of the game so I hope my guess is kind of accurate. €5 would’ve been a good price for a game like this but I think €8 is just too much.  I suggest waiting for a sale.\n\nFist Of Jesus is a decent game that we’ve all seen tens of times before. It does most things well, but there are also quite a few flaws in it. If I had to be honest I’d choose several other (but similar) games over this one and I think I’m not the only one. Only if you’re a die-hard beat ‘em up lover can I recommend this.\n\n[Rating: 64/100]","October 21, 2014","true","4.5"," 45 of 83 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","45","83","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/katobytes/recommended/321110/","katobytes","KatoBytes","http://steamcommunity.com/id/katobytes/","87 products in account","Take the place of Jesus and Judas in a very tedious adventure as they beat up zombies to...save the world? Close enough. For starters, Fist of Jesus is a beat 'em up, as you can tell from just acknowledging the "Fist" included in the title, right? Indeed, it suceeds in being a somewhat solid game but is not recommended unless you spot a certain sale on it.\n\nThere really is no story here, just Jeebus and his buddy Judas (well at least for now) find themselves in the center of all this commotion due to zombies, and now it is your job to pummel the undead by ceaselessly spamming the spacebar to ensure the prosperity of Wherever-This-Game-Takes-Place-Land. So Fun! Furthermore, there's this peculiar one named Lazarus. Rather menancing being, so it's completely justifiable to assume he is the cause of this entire predicament.\n\nBeat 'Em Ups, and other fighting games in general, posses this advantage where they can discard any remote plot, lore, or story with malice, but also with promises of gameplay. Fist of Jesus is a game that most players will find themselves completing in about 8 hours, 10-12 should they be convinced to complete the game. A rather decent length for games like these, admittedly. Fortunately, FOJ is fun game, that is, only for the first 2 hours. This is in regards to the fact that this game is bereft of any combo system or any mix-up to spice things up. Now, that's not to say this game is a chore, considering that Judas and Jesus have 3 special moves each, and there are melee weapons, projectiles, upgrades, and "Divine Punishments" to keep the general scope of the game from stagnating, but these extras are not as fun to use or to even look foward to in the long run as:\n\nThe upgrade catalog is generic and there is no obligation to purchase them as you can literally manage to beat the game without much of them. This goes without saying it isn't hard to buy said upgrades as the coins required are ubiquitous, but upgrades only ever so slightly strengthen your character it seems like a waste.\n\nThe selection of usable melee and ranged weapons are helpful in-game but are insipid copy/pastes of eachother (Ex. Chain and Whip)\n\nDivine Punishments are monotonous as there are maybe 5 or so of them looped and they will lose their charm rather quick.\n\nBoss battles are without doubt the most boing aspect of the game as they, like all other aspects of this damn game, repeat themselves and are too easy.\n...And don't even bother to complete the game as it is a downright chore as you will be depending on luck to get the perfect 3 Stars rating on some stages. Yet I nonetheless made the badge... Jesus, no, FIST of Jesus (So much for infusing cheap humor, amirite?)\n\nUnless having your spacebar jam due to perpetual tapping (speaking from experience) is in your ideal set of play, Fist of Jesus is yet another title that is not worth the standard $10 dollars. It is a moderately long game but a mostly sleep-inducing one given it's faliure to distinguish itself from the rest of the religious-themed brawlers gaming has to offer. It is only reccomended you purchase this game when it is on a sale for 50% minimum or via the Humble Bundle service.\n\nMaybe I'm just berating the game too much, just maybe. I'm way to bored if I'm making this unreasonably lengthy reviews.","January 17, 2015","false","7.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","2"

I did not downvote this because I was "offended" but because of the overall quality of the product.\n\nI got this game through a Humble Bundle. I would have NOT purchased it for full price. Its a very basic beat em up. Its not particularly difficult to complete and mastering it depends on a lot of luck. The game is severely unpolished. One thing that was very frustrating was the fact you are graded on a "1-3 star reward" system each level with a certain amount of points unlocking another star. The only issue is that nowhere in the game (that I could find) does it say how much you need per star.\n\nThere are only 3 bosses but 9 boss stages which means you fight the same boss again and again they just get slightly "harder" (more health each time).\n\nWith beat em ups being a genre that has been around as long as it has and has been done so well in recent years, its a shame this was so bland and simplistic.\n\nBut now for the "controversy" surrounding this game. The following is more of a commentary on us as a people than the product itself. A lot of people feel it shouldnt be allowed on steam and that "blasphemy laws" should be enacted world wide to prevent people from mocking religious (In the case of Jesus, mythological) figures, like in the recent Paris shootings at Charlie Hebdo. I say this, if your god is so weak and pathatic that it needs YOU to go hurt people when they make fun of it, then your god is the super natural equal of a 14 year old girl on Facebook.\n\nIn fact, blasphemy laws themselves are blasphemous because it says "my god cant handle people making fun of it so it needs me to punish them for it." Funny stuff.\nOverall, I personally wouldnt buy this game for full price. I support the idea of indy devlelopers but this one felt REALLY phoned in.","January 18, 2015","false","26.6"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","1"

It's like a free flash game with Jesus and blood in it so they can charge for it and work the kinda-but-not-really-taboo subject of putting Jesus in a video game and make sales based on that fact alone. I didn't once really find it very amusing as one might assume it would be. It is just a cookie cutter flash game that sucks nuts and I don't even want to know how to select stage 12. Oh and controller movement completely sucks, and I have the most recognized controller there is for pc games which is a xbox 360 wired controller. It is like moving around a square cardboard cutout that walks too far in the direction you push even slightly. Movement just does not feel good at all because it isn't programmed here worth a f-ck and should be much tighter and not be a prime reason of why the game is so hard. $10 for this game at normal price = lol.

Romans, cowboys and other random enemies. The game originally made for hand helds) plays in short stages where you usually have a objective to complete. Those usually range from kill enemies, survive, don't get hit, or achieving a certain score amount. It's just too bad the game play is incredible boring and broken. Your character can take a hit from close, far, from enemies not even facing him, and worst of all from enemies not even standing on the same level as him (this game has the bad 3D fighter mechanic of walking close and far from the screen). You can also perform a divine punishment which a finisher on stunned enemies but this seems to happen almost at random and there doesn't seem to be a sure fire way to stun a enemy. Also after you see it happen the first time it turns into something you wish that you could skip.\n\nAs per usual for these games, you are expected to do a lot of grinding to level your character up. I never did notice a difference in it though as even after fully upgrading your damage the AI still seemed to take the same amount of hits. If anything it just makes it easier for them to kill you. Graphically it looks like something you'd see in an iOS game, it has bright cartoon looking graphics. It is horrible to control however, feeling stiff and sometimes unresponsive.\n\nOverall even on sale I can't recommend this. It really doesn't have anything going for it and you'll hate it more then you'll ever enjoy it.\n\n\nScore :\n\n1/10\n\nhttp://apocalypticdemise.com/2015/06/13/fist-of-jesus-review/","June 13, 2015","false","8.9"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

The character levelling system adds purpose to the otherwise mindless combat, and the daily goals are a nice excuse to play a little bit every day, instead of trying to grind through everything as quickly as possible.

Totally digging the humor/gore combo in it, reminds me of South Park. The music is awesome - it's like in those old westerns - I found myself whistling the theme for quite a while now :)\nI find the graphics style really fitting with the ongoing parody/fun theme of the game. It's immensely satisfying to unleash the wrath of god on a horde of zombies, pick up a limb and beat up the rest with it, throw a fish into their faces and then casually rip their spines out Sub-Zero style - FATALITY!\nThe game had a rough start, but I think the recent patch fixed everything I had problems with. Yes, I would love to be able to rebind my controls, as I don't fancy the space bar as a viable key to mash, but again, the game doesn't really encourages you to mash the keys as you wanna be doing fatalities for more points and stars.\nMany may argue that the game starts slow, but once you've unlocked all of the special powers and reach the cowboy levels - a smile will shine on your face as you shoot everybody with your\nSawed off Shotgun and unleash hell with your powers!\nWith the recent addition of Steam trading cards, I find the game price totally justifiable.\n\nTL:DR or you just want to see me in action - check my first impressions video - http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=329718929","October 21, 2014","true","6.2"," 9 of 20 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","9","20","0","0"

The game's concept is insane but somehow plausable.... as in, I accept this idea and enjoy it... I mean really, it's no less insane than the actual true story of Jesus Christ...\n\nAll the shock value and controversy aside, it's a mediocre game. The controls are a bit of a hassle and take a while to get used to but after all that, it's just a grind out to level up and get stronger.\n\nGetting 3 stars on each stage prooves quite the challenge but the game is completely beatable without doing so. The shooting mini game from Kirby Super Star makes it's return and it's just as annoying as ever... I couldn't stomach doing them after the 5th encounter so I skipped doing them...\n\nIf you're looking for something to tie you over until a good beat 'em up game arrives like River City Ransom Underground, then this will do the trick. Don't pay full price for it though, get it on sale for at least 50% off... again, it's mediocre at best but experiencing the concept is worth the sale price.","November 3, 2014","true","4.6"," 9 of 20 people (45%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","45","9","20","2","0"

Jesus makes a mistake and brings the dead back to life as zombies. This game is not meant to be a serious emotional story of many ups and downs or at least I don't think so, what the game is is a good laugh the game is about Judas and Jesus fighting zombie hordes and not just zombie hordes at one point you even fight cowboy zombies so yeah do not expect a serious story line. If you are deeply religious this game may not be your style of humor or it may be it all depends on how seriously you take it.  The gameplay its self is fast paced with you going side to side on a screen in various levels beating the crap out of zombies, getting your abilities unlocked and charged up to rain starts from the sky, summon bread and blast a huge laser beam in front of you and if you time your hits right you can rip out the hearts of your enemies. The combat is fairly fast and features a variety of different enemies. There are your standard guys, zombie centurions, cowboys, BIG zombies and the occasional boss fight.  The only problem I have with the combat is that it seems a little to easy I very rarely died on any levels and if you die you will spawn as the second character and continue beating the undead back into the ground. The games writing to me gives me a good chuckle from time to time. The art style of the game looks very good to me it is very cartoony and suits the unseriousness of the game well. The game has some features providing rewards for playing so many days such as free weapon tokens, gold etc but regardless I do not find me self feeling like I really have a drive to finish the game but the time I have spent with the game so far has been fun,\n\nif you enjoy a beat em up game then this is for you, if you like a game that doesn't take itself to serious and you enjoy some silliness in the games you play then this one could be for you. The controls of the game are a bit strange as I have been using a ps3 controller emulated as xbox and they are weird at times but overall usable I would rate this game at about 6.5/10 as although it is an enjoyable experience after playing through around 20 levels I feel I have had my enjoyment but if you enjoy the beat em ups enough the game contains a good deal more levels than that and does give you a good amount of playtime.","October 23, 2014","true","1.0"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","4","10","0","0"

If you're a fan of games such as Double Dragon or Castle Crashers, you'll surely enjoy this one as well. Beware though, you'll be doing quite a bit of grinding to level up if you want to hit the level 40 achievement.\n\nThe game isn't long, but that can be seen as a positive since it doesn't overstay it's welcome. Brawlers tend to become repititious since you're basically doing the same ol' thing time and again. However, the game does keep things fresh by introducing different goals for each level.\n\nOverall, I give the game a thumbs up. The only real downside at the moment is that the progression for certain achievements is broken, however the dev said they're looking into it.","October 30, 2014","true","16.2"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

I do still have problems on the main menu (controlling the cursor is nigh impossible because of how fast it moves, so I have to use the mouse), but otherwise the game can be played with a controller now.  Hence my review update.\n\nIt's fun to play, and the theme amuses me a great deal.  It could use a more polished translation (particularly as I get further along) and a more detailed options menu, but overall the game's presentation is charming and puts its theme to good use.  The rather silly but well-made promo videos I've seen for the game did a good job of capturing its nature, and I approve.\n\nIt's been fun to play so far, though it's starting to wear thin gameplay-wise (I have reached the desert level, and I'm starting to lose interest in the gameplay, which doesn't change all that much).  It turns out the game is single-player only, which feels like a missed opportunity but oh well.  The power-ups are fun and over the top, and I like having two characters (with the backup jumping in after the first dies).  But the combat definitely feels a bit samey after the 20th or so mission, and your movement and attack options start to feel pretty limited.\n\nI definitely recommend the game all the same.  I've had fun with it, and I feel like I've gotten my money's worth.","October 19, 2014","true","1.5"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","2"

If you like Battletoads, X-Men, Simpsons, AVP, TMNT, Final Fight, Castle Crashers, Double Dragon, Scott Pilgrim, or any other game in the beat em up genre, you will love this.\n\nUnless you're a diehard Christian with no sense of humor - then definitely stay away.\n\nFor the first 2 hours I played this game tonight I was laughing my ♥♥♥ off at the dialog, the animations, the names of powers, the enemies, and everything in general.\n\nThere is one thing I will note and that once you get deep into the game like chapter 3 and beyond, it gets harder than ♥♥♥♥, no joke. Have fun beating Lazarus the second time, I gave up after 10 fails. I may be missing something.\n\nYou get Judas and Jesus and can swap betweenthem - though thus far the controller bind for this does not work at all - and they each get 3 unique powers, usually one being protective, one being an AoE, and the other being a straight line attack that is also AoE but can only hit in a straight line. Your characters can  pick up various weapons and items in the levels or buy them before it starts, and  you can also destroy world objects to gain items.\n\nEach level presents a goal you must meet before the timer ends in order to proceed. Usually it is to survive but in the harder levels it is to kill a certain amount of enemies and gain a certaina mount of points, without dying, before the timer runs out. And on some of these levels, it's ridiculously hard - enemies will literally fill the screen until it's impossible to move.\n\nRegardless, I haven't had this much fun with a game in a very long time.","October 24, 2014","true","4.6"," 3 of 10 people (30%) found this review helpful","30","3","10","0","0"

Check out my podcast Steam on the Cheap where I review cheap games and let you know if they are worth your money.\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/steam-on-cheap-discovering/id899847567?mt=2\n\nFist of Jesus is a fun and simi deep side scrolling brawler in the vein of the old NInja Turtles or Double Dragon games. Here is my first impression video review and read on for a more in depth review.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPZHKFHtMGs&feature=youtu.be\n\nJesus brought Lazarus back from the dead and unwittingly started a zombie pandemic that spans the ages. You get to play as either Jesus or Judas and eradicate the zombies before the world is lost.\n\nSo far this game is a lot of fun and has a delightful amount of gore in it. Things I like so far include\nMortal Kombat like fatalities on zombies.\nA nice array of special abilities.\nThe ability to gain levels and upgrade powers through rpg elements.\nThe art is fun and fresh.\nDialog is funny and may make you lol.\nThe controls handle well.\nDecent variety of baddies.\n\nThings I don’t like so far include.\nButton layout for the keyboard is odd. Luckily you can bind whatever buttons you want to fix it.\n360 Controller not working properly. It tries to work but very wonky.\nThey don’t tell you what buttons activate abilities in game you have to exit and go to the key binding menu.\n\nMore on gameplay\nYou can tag team between Jesus and Judas on every level. Think of Capcom vs X-Men and such. Each guy has different special abilities and different traits that make them desirable. When you kill zombies they drop coins that you can later use to either upgrade your powers or to resurrect mid level if  you happen to die. There are plenty of weapons that you can find mid level such as a sword fish, super fish, chain, stave and more. This really does feel like an 80’s early 90’s game done right with better graphics. This game does have the angry bird approach when it comes to progression. You can get up to 3 stars on each level depending on your performance and at certain points you need a minimum amount of start to continue. That being said you may need to go back and 3 star a few levels to move on. Don’t forget your upgrades as you go.\n\nThis game is definitely worth a play it is fun and seems to be a good time sink. What I need to find out now is if it is a good cheap game for those of us on a budget. I will update this post when I see how many hours of gameplay I get through and let you know. you can also listen to the podcast for a more indepth review after hours of gameplay.\n","October 17, 2014","true","5.1"," 21 of 92 people (23%) found this review helpful","23","21","92","0","1"

The basic concept is that you're Jesus and Jesus going up against the minions of Lazarus, proving once again that sometimes dead is better. Starts off with zombie peasants and zombie Centurians, then for some reason kicks it up to zombie cowboys and the like. It's a weird angle to take, but I've found it fun.\n\nThe initial problem with it is def the controls, as that has taken some work to sort out and I've ended up having to google for it instead. Not ideal, but eventually I get past that and so it got better over time. The early levels build up in difficulty and complexity slowly, however that really kicks up to another level and the last 10 or so levels start to get incredibly difficult with an unrealistically steep difficulty curve, and I'm not even sure if the last level is beatable without a whole lot of grinding first.\n\nThere are some gameplay issues that show up throughout as somewhat frustrating, there's def some issues with the KO method being reliable or predictable, and it seems to be somewhat random, which is a problem when some levels have goals for that. The inconsistency also shows up in the achievements, as there's some achievements that require grinding something that is basically randomly generated, which is the sort of achievement that is just frustrating.\n\nOverall, while those are problems, those still feel minor to me. The brunt of the gameplay is still causing stars to fall from the sky or having Jesus create walls of fire in order to kill zombies, and it's got a pretty entertaining tone to it that I find fun. Nothing like than lich vs zombie warfare.","February 6, 2015","true","12.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

So how does it work? Extremely well actually, graphics look nice (if you are into that sort of stuff, cartoony i mean) and story is really hilarious and full of epic one-liners. Now i personally do not feel offended by this theme eventhough i am a Christian, but if you are too much into religion i guess this game shouldnt be an option for you. So lets move to pros and cons.\n\nPros\n1. Basically the whole story and the vibe you get while playing is priceless, plus funny one-liners and names of powers\n2. It runs smoothly, effectively handling large amounts of enemies without any lag or whatsoever\n3. Music fits really well and you will find yourself whistling\n4. Challenging levels, basically from the very start. Thats both a plus and a minus depending on your character.\n\nCons\n1. Its way too repetitive. Basically after getting to about half of the game, you will have seen all of the enemies. Also i didnt really like mixing all the zombies together just like that, i mean Romans, Egyptians and cowboys, just doesnt feel right. Special moves involving divine punishment become just meh, losing that shock effect it had for the first time. Also there are only 3 animations for that which isnt a lot in my opinion.\n2. Horrible bosses! This is maybe the worst aspect of the game. Basically you have three different bosses which appear over and over again but each time with more enemies to help them and less time for you to finish it. Gets frustrating really fast.\n3. As mentioned above, levels are challenging to the point of being ridiculously hard. Like get no hit and get 25 divine punishments on mini-bosses.\n4. Achievements involve a lot of grinding. Stuff like equip a weapon before the level 300 times shouldnt exist in my opinion (game has 50 levels i think so that would mean 6 playthroughs) or kill that many zombies with a leg, get xxxx number of divine punishments etc. So not really easily obtainable.\n5. Again grinding up, you will find yourself unable to beat a boss or some levels without raising your level first. Basically without gold for reviving or good punch etc. you dont stand a chance against any tougher composition of foes. It took me a while to get to lvl 25 and there seems to be 40 levels (according to the achievement)\n6. Some minor bugs such as cowboys with guns being able to shoot you even though they are facing another direction\n7. Now this is irrelevant but some grammar mistakes seemed to annoy me. Stuff like ca'nt instead of can't should be corrected\n\nAfter writing this i see that i listed more cons than pros. I still recommend it though as you will certainly have fun for a while and laugh a lot. But get this only while it's on a big sale. It is way overpriced, i got it for 50% off and still feel it's kind of expensive.","January 13, 2015","true","12.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's very easy to fix and NOT cause for a bad review.\n\nSo, Fist of Jesus is the tale of Jesus and his life-partner Judus, carving a bloody path through zombies and bad English to... well, who cares why? And how can my messiah possibly be this kawaii? (Note: This is an athiest review!) So, let's look at the details:\n\nThe greatest sin of this game is its obvious touch-screen controls from a phone port, but that said, the control scheme is quite intuitive and responsive when correctly set up. The game strikes a delicate balance between easy button-bashing and hardcore survival against waves of relentless enemies. Dodgy hitbox detection is both your ally and enemy, allowing you some sneaky kills, while requiring you to get far further away than you'd think from attacks.\n\nEach level has a possible 3 stars to win, with the odd reflex-testing minigame dotted about. You level up a la RPG, powering up your health, punches, JUDASKAME(hameha), JESUSPLOXION, and unlocking fatality moves. Having played for a few hours, I seem to have barely scartched the surface, offering quite a lot of gameplay for a mobile port.\n\nHonestly, I can't fault this game. Its charm far outweighs its flaws, and I found myself wanting to keep on playing. Do yourself a favour and accept the silly theme of this game and its religious overtones, and get stuck-in to a cutesy bloodbath of fun!","January 21, 2015","true","9.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Mostly beacuse it seems like it probably was taken straight from Facebook or something and ported over. The mechanics of the game are pretty simple and it's a reasonably fun brawler, but the style of the game really doesn't appeal to me.\n\nEnemies can come from all edges of the screen so you're not safe anywhere and hitboxes are kind of weird if you move "up," so always move down to avoid attacks. There's also resources that you collect and there's also "daily rewards" for playing which always leave a bad taste in my mouth. At least it's fun, though, I guess. I got to level 14 before I decided it was probably okay for me to be spending credits, but honestly, I'm not sure how to feel about this game. A lot of the "small things" really irritate me, but it doesn't detract from the gameplay yet, so I guess it's not an issue.\n\nThis game appeals to players who like mashing buttons to beat things up, especially if they enjoy beating up zombies, so if you're into that sort of thing, yeah, give this game a whirl.","January 21, 2015","true","3.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However, skilled players (and, through the use of abilities and items, you can certainly develop skills) are rewarded with the star ranking system. Those who are a little bit OCD, like myself, will probably find themselves playing levels over and over trying to get that last star for completionist's sake.\n\nThe mechanics can be a little buggy, particularly in regards to abilities - which sometimes (though only rarely) are not activated when keys are pressed, but will still require a cooldown before they can be used again. Movement is a little clunky, and it can be hard to align your fighter with enemy hordes, making it frustratingly difficult in an encounter where multi-kills or zero-damage are necessary to complete the level.\n\nThe soundtrack is Western-themed, upbeat and excellent. The settings are charming, and the dialogue witty, if not a little cringe-inducingly tongue-in-cheek at times.\n\nI'd definitely recommend this to casual or veteran fighting game fans, and also to any militant atheist with an axe to gring.","December 21, 2014","true","9.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The basic concept is that you're Jesus and Jesus going up against the minions of Lazarus, proving once again that sometimes dead is better. Starts off with zombie peasants and zombie Centurians, then for some reason kicks it up to zombie cowboys and the like. It's a weird angle to take, but I've found it fun.\n\nThe initial problem with it is def the controls, as that has taken some work to sort out and I've ended up having to google for it instead. Not ideal, but eventually I get past that and so it got better over time. The early levels build up in difficulty and complexity slowly, however that really kicks up to another level and the last 10 or so levels start to get incredibly difficult with an unrealistically steep difficulty curve, and I'm not even sure if the last level is beatable without a whole lot of grinding first.\n\nThere are some gameplay issues that show up throughout as somewhat frustrating, there's def some issues with the KO method being reliable or predictable, and it seems to be somewhat random, which is a problem when some levels have goals for that. The inconsistency also shows up in the achievements, as there's some achievements that require grinding something that is basically randomly generated, which is the sort of achievement that is just frustrating.\n\nOverall, while those are problems, those still feel minor to me. The brunt of the gameplay is still causing stars to fall from the sky or having Jesus create walls of fire in order to kill zombies, and it's got a pretty entertaining tone to it that I find fun. Nothing like than lich vs zombie warfare.","February 6, 2015","true","12.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

By kicking and hitting and miracle-making them in the face.\n\nThe premise sounded to silly to be true. And with its simple super-deformed sprites and a general over-the-topness this could very well be the best "Jesus vs. Zombies" game ever. Full stop.\n\nAnd in truth it's not too bad a game. An obvious iOS port that would be much better on a touchscreen, FoJ has the basics down, but that's about it. Like many other reviews state, collision is more than just a bit too wonky and you can easily get beaten by enemies that aren't even facing your general direction. Upgrades take a lot of grinding and make very little difference. The writing is occasionally really bad... and even after five minutes you realise that there are several... MANY!... better ports with a similar gameplay.\n\nStill you can't help but adoring the gutsy and silly premise, and if you're okay with a game that either requires no brains at all for most of the time you may get at least a few laughs out of Jesus and Judas smashing their way through undead canonfodder. I mean, seriously. Jesus kicks undead until they are... dead. And then hits them with a fish. Can you say that loud without a chuckle?

But if you think your Super Mario is the bee's knees, I've got another moustachioed superhero that's gonna rock your socks off.\n\n\nHis name... is Jesus. Maybe you've heard of him.\n\n\nJesus was a pretty cool dude with some wild ideas. He was a rebel, he was off the chain. And he loves you, too. He'll always love you, no matter what.\n\n\nUnless you're a zombie. Zombies are his natural prey. Or I suppose you could say... pray.\n\n\nNow, I'd recommend for you to take a seat. The following may shock, appall, and/or entice you.\n\n\nThis is a game where you play as Jesus, fighting a zombie apocalypse with your bare hands.\n\n\nIf you are not sold on this game, I'm afraid you're beyond help.\n\n\nThis is Fist of Jesus: The Bloody Gospel of Judas. Yes, this is a real thing. Available on Steam, iOS, and Android. You can pay real money for this. It's seriously a thing.\n\n\nJesus has accidentally resurrected zombies, and they've now infested everything. It's up to our hero Jesus to save the day. It's nice to finally have a realistic depiction of what happened in the Bible. Such a great game, and educational too.\n\n\nIt's a simple beat-em-up, like the old TMNT or Double Dragon games. Jesus must "save the souls" of the zombies. With his fists. Or swords. Or chains. Or shotguns. Or massive crucifixes. You'll massacre your way through each level and unleash holy vengeance on all before you with your best friend and sidekick Judas. He's totally not gonna betray you or anything. With his help, you'll be taking down zombies, bigger zombies, and cowboy zombies. Yep, this game has it all.\n\n\nHowever, like I said... if the initial revelation that such a game existed didn't sweep you off your feet, it's not the game for you. Fist of Jesus is not a perfect game. It's not an in-depth game. It's mindless fun, the way beat-em-ups are. There are mild RPG elements, and you can learn some special moves. Jesus can spawn bread from thin air and raise pillars of fire. You can level him up until he can punch off zombie heads in one hit. Teach him fatalities, like ripping out hearts or uppercutting spinal cords out.\n\n\nAnd yet all of this can't save it from being needlessly grindy or repetitive. Leveling up is definitely necessary. Later levels will crush you if your fists are not holy enough. And you'll need to grind for money to purchase character upgrades. Which would be fine if every level wasn't so repetitive. It's not like there's any structure to the levels. They're just the same blank battlefield. Sure, each level will have different weapons and items lying around the arena. But that's not a major difference. There's no level design.\n\n\nSimply killing everything in a level isn't always enough either. Each level will have different win goals. Sometimes you just need to survive. Other times you'll need to earn a certain number of points, or kill a certain number of a certain enemy. Which can be especially frustrating if you're not sure WHY you keep failing a mission. The points are kind of confusing. You get bonus points for fatalities or using weapons, and yet I've failed point-based missions where I got a dozen fatalities in a row. When in actuality I just needed to have a higher level Jesus and kill zombies faster.\n\n\nYour score in each level will get you a ranking from one star to three stars. These are needed to perform the miracle of opening new levels. The greatest of Jesus' miracles. However, sometimes it's near impossible to get more than one star in a level. Similar to how getting the right number of points to beat the level is confusing, reaching an unknown amount of points for the three star rank is even harder. They should really clarify the point values of ♥♥♥♥. Would be easier to figure out "oh, I just need to do this" instead of "I killed everything, why is this not working".\n\n\nStill, even with its semi-decent gameplay... I've sunken a pretty big chunk of time into it, and have enjoyed every second of it. Because Jesus with a shotgun blasting through hordes of zombies is the greatest dollar I've ever spent on Steam.\n\n\nI've spent hours just mashing buttons and laughing uncontrollably. Because I just used a chainsaw to dismember a massive zombie. As Jesus. Sure, Judas is in there too. But I main Jesus. He's my main. That should be a bumper sticker. "Jesus is my main".\n\n\nThe best part of the game is its ridiculousness. The stupidly cute sprites and goofy art style, mixed with the animated bloodbaths and gory dismemberment scenes. The fact that you're playing as Jesus, using a shotgun, to kill a zombie in a cowboy outfit. None of it fits together coherently, and yet it works. It just works. The music is sort of dramatic and western-sounding, and the sound effects are goofy sounding. And it's hard to tell if the writing was done by someone who's native language is not English or if it's done on purpose. A lot of semi-nonsensical dialogue.\n\n\nThis is a game that you can judge at face value. There's no hidden depth to this game. It's not a hidden gem of any sort. It's hilariously stupid. If spending a couple bucks on a game called "Fist of Jesus" sounds like a good idea to you, it will be worth it. If it sounds stupid and you think you wouldn't enjoy it, chances are you won't. The enjoyment comes from reveling in the chaos unfolding onscreen. Jesus beating a zombie to death with his own arms definitely sounds like a good time to me. Maybe you'll think differently.\n\n\n\nThat's how wars start though. I dunno if you want that. Especially if Jesus can take on an entire army of zombies with only his fists. Jesus ain't having any of you nonbelievers out there. The God Delusion? Better be ready for some brain contusions, know what I'm saying? Jesus is out of control.\n\n\nHe appears to be invincible. And he's the main character. Clearly, his story must have a happy ending. Right? I never got that far in the Bible, I always get lost trying to figure out who's begetting who. Or why they're begetting people. Begets aren't all that good. Croissants are the superior French food.\n\n\nCroissants are always buttery and delicious.\n\n\nBegets are just like my humor. Tasteless.\n\n\n\nLet's get biblical, biblical. I wanna get biblical.\n\n\n\nI couldn't find anywhere else to work it in but cringed so hard when it crossed my mind, so I knew it must've been important to fit in here somehow.","June 5, 2015","true","4.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Jesus and his BFF, Judas, have to fight them off (actually, Judas may be not so much of a Best Friend Forever, but perhaps a Best Friend For The Moment - you know, until that whole 30 pieces of silver incident comes between them).\n\nJesus and his BFFTM play tag team in fighting the zombie hordes. As Jesus, you keep killing the zombies until you die, and then Judas takes over - and vice versa. Fortunately, Jesus comes back to fight again in the next round - you don't even have to wait three days for him to resurrect.\n\nNot a lot of tactics are involved, but there's a whole lot of very fast click-click-clicking and tap-tap-tapping on your keyboard, as you kick and punch your way through the cohorts of the living dead (if you want to get a case of Repetitive Strain Injury, then this is the game for you).\n\nJesus and Judas smash the decaying departed with chains, clubs, swordfish, body parts, and other unlikely weapons of mass destruction. Presumably the idea of turning the other cheek doesn't apply to zombies.\n\nIt has a 1980s game style, so be forewarned to be underwhelmed by the game mechanics. Don't buy this for serious game playing - buy it on sale, play it for a couple of hours, and then throw it away.\n\nFist of Jesus should only be recommended on the basis of having some cheap laughs. If you're ok with that, then - in the words of the Great Lord on High - "Game on, my Son!"\n\n\nP.S.\nInterestingly, the game is based upon the 2012 film, Fist of Jesus - a short comedic sacrilegious production from Spain.\n\nThe film is available on the internet, with English subtitles. It's only 14 minutes long, and - thankfully - you can fast forward through it, if you can't stand watching too much of it.\nhttps://vimeo.com/88799881\n\nWatch the film if you have time to waste (and a high tolerance for stupid movies) - just make sure that you have your fast forward button at the ready. The short film is worth a look at, but only just to see how awful it is.","May 24, 2015","true","8.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

I did a video of my blind reaction which I think captures what this game has to offer pretty well which I'll link to and will follow up with a full text review below.\n\nInitial Reaction:\nHoly Crap Jesus Fighting Zombies!!\n\nI can tell you how funny this game is all day but I truly believe the proof is in the gameplay. But now on to a more formal look at the game.\n\nOverview\nFist of Jesus is a side-scrolling beat-em-up game featuring Jesus as the main playable character. It follows him and Judas on their journey to stop Lazarus, whom Jesus has resurrected from the dead, from raising a zombie army bent on taking over the world. The gameplay is simple old school fisticuffs action, and presents it's challenges in a series of Mario 3 style level on an over-world map.\n\nPresentation\nI think this is one of the best things the game has going for it. The art style is charming and cutesy while the juxtaposition of that against Jesus f-ing Christ mercilessly beating zombies to a bloody pulp is absolutely hilarious. The animation is what you would expect from a simple game like this but they put some nice touches in where it counted. One such instance I vividly remember laughing at was when judas "skirt" flies up showing his purple undies after throwing a fish. These sort of funny little things combined with some very over the top, and flashy special moves such as ripping out zombie's still beating hearts or chainsawing their limbs off with a saw fish skeleton make for some very entertaining visuals.\n\nGameplay\nI have to say, for what I assume is a port of a mobile game over to steam I think the controls translated pretty well. I played with my PS4 controller which the game allows you to map to which I thought was a nice touch. I will say, figuring out what buttons do what from the menu they give to map the controller is a bit of a pain but it's worth it if you have the patients. The in game controls are tight, punching feels good, using items such as rocks, chains and SWORD FISH! feel even better. The hit-boxes can be a little crazy some times but honestly it mostly works in your favor in that regard. I often found myself hitting 3 or 4 zombies at once which was nice when I was getting surrounded.\n\nSound\nI think the music for this game, while a little repetitive (I think there's only like 4 songs in the whole game that I heard) was very fun. I didn't get bored of it, and even caught myself whistling the main theme the following day. The sound effects in game are what you'd expect. Thwaks, sawks, and thuds for punches, and moans for zombies. Though the sound of Judas' Ki Wave (Ha-Do-Ken) was very satisfying.\n\nOther Notes\nThere's a lot of good things I can say about this game but there is one glaring problem I would be remiss if I didn't mention. It is fairly buggy... Most notably was a bug I found when I completed a level. After clicking the next level button I was put on a loading screen that just would not go away. I would hear the game load behind it, and it would even take input to the point where I could start the next level behind the loading screen, but the overlay would not go away. Each time this happened the only fix I could find was to re-start the game. That glaring bug, the fact that mapping the controller to it was exceedingly difficult, and some moments of legit "engrish" in the game's dialog do mire the experience a little, it has to be said.\n\nVerdict\nSo when I got this game last week it was $2.50 on sale. Given all the laughs that are to be had with this game I think that price-point is totally perfect. Spend your $2 and have some fun. The bugs and little problems are totally overlook-able considering how cheap it is and how funny the ascetic is combined with some pretty decent gameplay. That said I absolutely would not spend the $9 regular asking price for this one. I think that's robbery considering the state this game is in. So my final word... Wait till it's on sale again, and 100% get it then, you'll definitely have some fun.\n\nThanks for reading and I hope you found my review helpful, and/or enjoyed my gameplay video.
