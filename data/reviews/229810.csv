"http://steamcommunity.com/id/aprofilehere/recommended/229810/","aprofilehere","Gunderson Mallard","http://steamcommunity.com/id/aprofilehere/","2360 products in account","A Fistful of Fun\nThis is a shooter quite like no other. The Wild West themed bullet circus is utterly insane and enjoyable. All the mechanics of the game feel finely tuned and precise: dodging bullets and sending them back feels so intuitive you should never have to stand there and bleed. The levels and areas are all varied and peppered with details and events such as carrying a giant explosive piñata, robbing banks, dodging rolling crates and so on. The structure of the game has these different level types shuffled around and enemy placement is randomized, but this only one small part of what keeps the action fun and exciting throughout.\n\nThe playable characters are a definite highlight of the game. While most games might settle for differentiating characters by stats or looks alone, the colorful cast of a Fistul also has different styles based around the actual input and control of the character: you have a shotgun toting teacher whose two barrels need to be reloaded individually,  the wanted outlaw Billy who wields twin revolvers that only fire when the highlighted chamber is pressed, Bomberman fans will feel right at home playing as Pablo the demo daredevil and this is barely scratching the surface. Each character feels vastly different from the next and they all come with some alternative weapons that can be picked up in the game. Mastering each gunslinger bit by bit feels immensely satisfying and the only problem is deciding which one is your huckleberry.\n\nHowever, strong characters would be wasted if they didn't have some clever enemies to go up against and Fistful delivers on this front as well. Machine gun wagons, rabid bears, magic arrows, among others, are all a great match up against the heroes of Fistful. However, even the more standard gunslinging enemies keep things interesting as they will move about the map, flank you, set of explosives, and shoot behind cover. To help out against the overwhelming amount of bullets, the game also has powerups in the form of different whiskey that can give you a chance to ignore a bullet or make one of your own explode. Even with powerups though, you will need to hone your skills to keep your continues from running dry.\n\nThis shooter has a sure sense of style. The narrowing wide screen, red tones throughout, panning shots, acid wild west colors, arcade font and voice over, and old west monologues all come together nicely to bring out a sense of the legendary west. The soundtrack also does a fantastic piece of Morricone inspired tunes. The chants, whistling and marching drums go along nicely with the rest of the aesthetics.\n\nThe local and online co-op are both fun experiences and each mode available is pure hectic fun. However, the 9 player local co-op is really more for laughs than ever actually accomplishing anything in the game. That being said playing in a group as The Magnificent Seven or going at it on your lonesome like The Man with No Name, there is a good time to be had. The story and arcade modes, aside from cutscenes and a definite ending, differ between some shuffled around mechanics and events (such as how upgrades work and taking peyote). Aside from unlocking characters in story mode, there are also safes that have a chance to drop new locations that get shuffled into the gameplay mix. The versus mode is a great way to let your friends know that this living room ain't big enough for the 2-9 of you. The different modes, unlocks, and urge to be better all go a long way in replay value.\n\nAs far as pure arcade madness goes, A Fistful of Gun has no equal.  The top down shooting action, whether alone or in co-op, is frantic, adrenaline fueled, and challenging.\n\n*Note: as an owner of Under the Ocean that did not refund my game, I was able to receive a free key from the developer ( See here for more info ). However, this does not affect my review of the game at all.","September 23, 2015","true","34.3"," 60 of 71 people (85%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","85","60","71","9","0"

A Fistful Of Gun is a fast-paced top-down shooter with rogue-like elements separated into 2 main modes: Arcade and Story. There's 11 different characters to choose from, each of them comes with unique controls and their own fighting system. The game has full controller support but for some characters you have to switch to keyboard & mouse, otherwise the game won't let you play them. When you start up the western action for the first time, you most likely begin with Arcade Mode that lets you pick all of those characters. Which is nice for practice purposes but can be terrible if your first choice is one of the guys with very odd controls. I have to admit I rage-quitted the game after two short runs of Arcade because I thought there's something wrong with the Steam Controller bindings (I'm using a template from the community). The character 'Noah' was the reason for it though. He's on the very left of the character select screen and why would you not start from the left?\nWell, obviously I gave the game another shot after checking the discussions and finding that other cowboys play very differently. I didn't regret starting it again because I found myself getting addicted to this little gem. Let me know tell you more about the main modes:\n\nArcade: You can select any character and start on a warm-up map. The goal is to clear the screen to get to the next one and reach the highest score. The maps and enemies are randomized but get significantly more difficult over the time. After you cleared a screen, the game gives you the option to choose among 5 random upgrades to make yourself stronger. One shot or hit of an enemy kills you and takes a life (in form of a card). You start with five hearts but a horse - that you can either steal from an enemy or get through an upgrade - or an armor upgrade take 1 bullet instead of you which basically means an extra life. Arcade can be played in single-player, local and online multiplayer.\n\nStory: Unlike Arcade mode, you can only pick one of the three already unlocked wranglers to start your journey with. The goal is to reach the 3rd chapter and kill the railroad baron Clayton Boon, the reason for all our troubles along the way. Each chapter ends with a unique boss fight and is 14 miles (= 14 screens) away from the start. Just as in the other mode, the enemies, type of maps and events are randomized, although you decide which direction you want to continue on. But keep in mind: There is no going back. Coins that you collect can be spent on several things such as new weapons, upgrades, playing cards (very important to increase the amount of your lives).  Unfortunately the story can only be played alone or in local co-op and there is no support for playing it online.\n\n★☆━━━━━━━━━[RATING: 8/10]━━━━━━━━━☆★\n\nPositive\nPixelart / Graphics: I adore them. The gunslingers have been designed with love and look super cute despite them being badass killers with moustaches and all. The maps itself lacks a bit of details on first glance - but honestly, it would make the bullethell just more confusing.\nGameplay: The gameplay is incredibly fun if you learn how to play with the characters and pick one that you like. You will get addicted to Story mode after experiencing new things you haven't seen before and secrets that still need to be revealed.\nEaster Eggs: It would be too spoiling to reveal too much, just let me tell you there's a lot of stuff randomly going on that you wouldn't predict and that will make you laugh for sure.\nSoundtrack: The soundtrack fits the setting well and is neither annoying nor too minimal, they really did a good job balancing it.\nEvents: The developer organizes special community events occasionally. Unfortunately I couldn't participate in any yet but I hope another one is happening soon! (These events are required to obtain some of the achievements)\nSteam features: Achievements - check, Trading Cards - check. Perfect! Cloud saving might useful to some players, I personally didn't need it. Workshop support would be pointless for this game.\nNeutral\nDifficulty: A Fistful Of Gun is not easy. Not at all. In almost 13 hours of playtime I still haven't beaten the campaign yet. I lost 30 lives in some screens and died because they really were impossible with the setup / loot I had. You need luck to get gold, to find a merchant and card players and you need luck with the screens you land on. Challenging games can be good and make you become ambitious but sometimes it felt like a pain in the ♥♥♥.. The achievements are (too) hard and rare as well.\nNegative\nMac / Linux Support: Not available. Every game should have support for all platforms on Steam or at least offer support for one additional OS.\nOnline Story Co-Op: You can only play Arcade and Versus online with friends. But the focus should be on the story and that mode can only be played alone or in local co op.\nHardware Information\n\nHardware Windows Mac   CPU 2.2GHz Intel Core Duo 2.6GHz Intel i7  GPU GeForce 9100M GeForce GT 650M    RAM 4GB (only 3 in use) 16GB   Storage 1TB HDD 256GB SSD + 1TB HDD   OS Windows 10, 32 Bit OS X El Capitan   Resolution 1920x1080 3840x2400 (Retina)   Controller Steam Controller Steam Controller\nThis game was played on my Windows computer.\n\n\nDisclaimer\nVegan™ - No animals got killed for this review.","February 18","true","12.6"," 38 of 43 people (88%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","88","38","43","4","4"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Nerney9/recommended/229810/","Nerney9","Nerney9","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Nerney9/","4746 products in account","Short Version:  A short, but highly replayable and entertaining multi-directional shoot-em-up in the tradition of Smash TV.  Great fun for a few bouts with friends now and then, but only buy solo if you're really into this type of game.\n\nIn a Fistful of Gun you can get together with a few trigger-happy friends to play with guns, get drunk, break stuff, and blow up angry chickens with dynamite all without the real-life consequences!  You choose from one of 11 different characters to run through random levels of retro gunslinging action, grabbing as many gold nuggets, power-ups and alcoholic boosts along the way as you can.\n\nOne of the biggest draws of the game is the multiplayer aspect, with high-score progress designed to track a full posse of players.  This is emphasized even further by the unforgiving gameplay, which can cause the 'continue' screen to pop up rather often in solo mode.  Even though bullets are too scarce in many stages to push this into bullet-hell territory, between the heat-seeking farm animals of doom, stray crates of dynamite, and of course a horde of guntoting baddies, you WILL die.  Simply completing the relatively short single-player story mode (which is truthfully about as story-less as a story mode can be) might take some practice.\n\nOf course, once a playthrough ends, the secondary hook of Fistful of Gun may very well entice you into another round;  Each of the eleven different characters to choose from features a different gun, which is actually an entirely new control scheme and shooting style.  One gunslinger fires large shotgun blasts, but only in the direction you're currently running and limited to a single shot in each barrel, while another wields a 6-shooter that can be quickly fired in any direction, but requires joystick flicking and a lengthy reload period after you empty the chamber.  Each of the guns requires you to learn a new set of skills, so perfecting them all could provide a very lengthy challenge.\n\nAll in all, Fistful of Gun is a fun, difficult game reminiscent of old school shooters, but with modern features added to boost entertainment and replayability.  If you're buying it purely for solo play, you might want to wait for a decent sale or be certain you enjoy this type of game - a short Story Mode, and a highly replayable but somewhat repetitive Arcade Mode designed around high scores might leave you feeling that the experience was a bit lacking. However, if you love retro shoot-em-ups or have a few friends to play with, A Fistful of Gun could be a blast.\n\nReceived a free copy for testing/reviewing purposes.","November 20, 2015","true","5.2"," 23 of 29 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","23","29","0","0"

Let me tell you why:\n\nI´ve seen old Spaghetti Western films because of my dad, always had contact with those movies cause he loved Clint Eastwood as the badass bounty hunter, but his favorite Sergio Leone´s film is "Once Upon a Time in the West" starring Charles Bronson. Anyone that never watched Sergio Leone´s films will not understand the game title or even the concept idea that the developer want to give you here (I might be wrong tho). You don´t need to know about these films, but It will make you appreciate the game even more.\n\nJust look at the first game trailer on Steam. People need to see The Good, the Bad & the Ugly movie to understand the intention: a Tribute to good old Western flicks.\n\nAnd It´s not about an idea only, the game in my personal opinion is amazing, It´s a fast paced 16 Bit graphics title. Full chaos at multiplayer, you need some skills at higher levels. I´ve always liked the "Simple but Fun" combination on other games, and this one has It.\n\nI´ve had smaller problems with the multiplayer, but guess what, the Developer is there for you. How many times you people had complaints about game developers leaving the title abandoned? this is not the case, Its been 7 months since the release on Steam and he´s been there, listening to the people that bought It (don´t believe me? go to the discussions). Why he behaves like that I asked myself, It was the first time for me that a developer actually read what I wrote. Well probably It´s because he loves what he does and he appreciates people who support him and enjoy his fast paced title. This deal makes me like the game even more, thinking that maybe he will add some DLC or new characters on a near future. If not, we still have such a solid game here. Trust me, It has a big replay value, simple but fun is the way to go sometimes.\n\nThe musical score is amazing, It will tranfer you to that crazy time. The gameplay and difficulty are good. You can´t go wrong here, what else do I need to tell you?. Support this guy, he deserves better ratings.","May 1","true","21.0"," 19 of 22 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","19","22","0","2"

It has so much style and different gameplay mechanics between the 11 characters you can play. So far I tried Arcade and Story modes and both are non-stop action for survival. You get a few lives and then have to start all over again in Arcade mode once you expend all your lives.\n\nThe music is decent as well as is the pixel graphics. Lots of interesting pick-ups and you can even buy from a store that gives you some power-ups. You also get power-ups after you beat a stage, which helps as you progress, since it does get harder.\n\nOverall I think this game is really good, I just hope they continue to add more content and characters to make this an even better game in the future. Also I personally thought that Duke with his Mini-Gun is amazing at gunning down the many enemies you have to face.\n\nI may update my review again after I try some of the online portion of the game when I find some more people to play with.\n\nGood job devs, keep up the good work!","November 14, 2015","true","5.2"," 21 of 27 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","21","27","0","1"

In all honesty I expected to play "A Fistful of Gun" longer since it looked very interesting (very much like "Hotline Miami"), but sadly it did not keep me interested long enough.\n\nLet's be clear here: this game is not my cup of tea. It's a classic "run around, avoid and shoot" game and I feel like it was design primarily for the multiplayer, which I haven't tested. Still, I've seen few reviews that compare it to "Hotline Miami" - I must admit, I don't see the similarity. "A Fistful of Gun" isn't much about strategy or planning, it's mostly mix of pure chaos, luck and skill.\n\nPros:\n+ Game setting. I just enjoy Wild West and I think "A Fistful of Gun" does a great job in terms of creating right atmosphere.\n+ Great music.\n+ Very nice graphic. Come on, who doesn't love pixels?\n+ Few characters to choose from. Characters that are different not only in the way the look, not only in terms of their skills, but also have different controls, which I find very interesting.\n+ Funny. There are few clever, humorous encounters.\n+ Self-aware. Game isn't set in serious tone, it's absurd and that's exactly the way it should be.\n+ Multiplayer. This game is just design for two (or waaay more) players. I can imagine it gets even more chaotic and waaay more hilarious when you play it with the group of friends.\n\nCons:\n- Story Mode. Yeaaah... nope. Not much for a story really. Just an intro, few encounters and fights. I didn't feel like I was playing with any purpose or goal, it was all rather foggy.\n- Only for shoot-em-up fans. If you're not particularly fond of this genre (like me) and you're looking for something else to keep you interested in the game (like story, lore or even unique gameplay), you will not find it. With this game you pretty much get what you see.\n\nShortly:\nIf you're a fan of shoot-em-up and/or plan to play it with friends - I recommend it.\nIf not... Well, you can safely pass on this one.","February 4","true","5.6"," 13 of 13 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","13","13","0","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Hi7ch/recommended/229810/","Hi7ch","Hitch","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Hi7ch/","307 products in account","A Fistful of Gun - The Righteous Review\nA few months ago I found a stream on twitch by this guy, Paul Hart, whom I had never heard about before. He was designing some graphics that seem to be based around the wonderful Sergio Leone spaghetti westerns of the 1960s, The Good The Bad and The Ugly, A fistful of Dollars, Once Upon a Time in America and others. In the background he was also streaming some music from those same films by the incredible Ennio Morricone. The art was good. The art was very good. I then realised this was not just some static images, this was all for a game that he was also developing. I have to admit, I was instantly hooked. My favourite movie genre was being recreated in my favourite pastime, video gaming.\n\nFast forward a few months to present time and I get to present to you the A Fistful of Gun review and if asked to sum up my feelings in one word, that word would be, wow.\n\nA Fistful of Gun – For a Few Gun More, is in simple terms a top down shooter where you and up to nine, yes nine, other players get to wield the baddest, most righteous gunslingers in the wicked wild west. Simple terms however do this game no justice, A Fistful of Gun is one of the most frenetic, hilarious, addictive and complete video games I have ever had the pleasure to play.\n\nTo say that Fistful of Gun is a multiplayer game would be doing it a severe injustice though at it’s heart it really is meant to be played with others, both locally through a wonderful system of couch co-op or online with fully optimised net code. Have no fears that this is yet another Indie game with tacked on online play as it is not, Fistful of Gun plays incredibly well online and offers a wealth of modes and fun, however I shall start with the story mode.\n\nTaking the role of one of eleven characters you play the part of a lone gunman with one task, to stop the evil railroad Baron, Clayton Boon, and avenge the ‘righteous psychosis’ of those he has wronged. To do this you must traverse thirteen miles of barren western deserts, hokey townships, corrupt lawmen, arrow toting red Indians and much much more. Along the way you will find pickups to upgrade your guns, barrels of Whiskey that really test your drunken gun-slinging skills, and even a very powerful drug induced high that will have you trippin’ all the way to your characters tombstone. After it’s initial release we are also promised access to Spirit Animals to help you on your quest. All of this is done through a top down, almost bullet hell game play filled with colour, and extremely pretty pixel styled graphics that invoke a retro gaming feel but a very modern and fast gaming experience.\n\nLevels in A Fistful of Gun vary extensively in looks and feel and you will find that what worked on the previous one will not do so on the next. This makes the game feel fresh every time you progress and each play-through is always a little different which can and will keep you coming back for more. Top this off with an excellent high score list that keeps track of all global players and your friends and you have more than one reason to keep coming back for more.\n\nIn addition to the single player Story section of the game we also have Local and Online Arcade mode which involves multiple levels of gunslinger action across all the varied themed areas and with harder A.I. as you progress. The arcade mode can also be played solo or with up to nine other players through online play or Fistfuls unique control style where all nine players can couch around just the one PC and use a combination of purely mouse control, pure keyboard control and of course full game controller support. I won’t lie, the controls can get confusing and each character has varying ways of being played so for some a controller is the only way, for others mouse and keyboard is your only option. This forces players to prefer one character over another but with eleven to choose from there is always a character for everyone’s style and abilities.\n\nThe other main online mode is Versus and as the name suggests it is you versus everyone else but as this is A Fistful of Gun the areas are also spiced up with TNT, Trains, Mexican outlaws and much more, all designed to make your job of killing your opponents as hard as possible and as much fun as it can be, and believe me it is fun!\n\nOnline play is done through dedicated servers and also includes the ability to create your own server on your PC using the included server.exe which is a rare thing these days and I applaud the developer Paul Hart for designing the game around this option from day one. It is both refreshing and inspiring to see more indie developers do this. Online play through either the dedicated or personal server is fast and easy to use from my pre-release tests and due to the inclusion of the server.exe I see no reason why this should not continue.\n\nOften overlooked in indie games is the audio and whilst the actual audio options are simplistic for Fistful of Gun the actual music, audio clips and voice acting are not. There is an inspired choice of musical style here that jumps from excellent heavy rock when needed to a more traditional Ennio Morricone spaghetti western theme that invokes even more memories of those classical movies. The voices used, whilst a small selection fit the genre perfectly too and just help to make the game feel like one of the most complete experiences I have had in many years.\n\nThe options are somewhat basic with little choice in resolution or effects but like many games of this ilk they really are not needed and will max out on virtually any PC from the last three to four years with ease with an option to drop the quality for older machines whilst still looking and playing gloriously.\n\nReleased for Windows PC that also includes a raft of Steam achievements and trading cards this game is an absolute steal and my biggest must buy of 2015.\n\nStrap on your belt, load up your six shooter. There is a new Multiplayer Game Of The Year and it is called A Fistful of Gun – For a Few Gun More.\n\nBuy this game, now!\n\n*This review was wrote in its entirety to The Ecstasy of Gold by Ennio Morricone*\n\nOriginal review here:\n\nhttp://www.thegamesshed.com/a-fistful-of-gun-review/","September 23, 2015","true","18.1"," 25 of 35 people (71%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","71","25","35","3","0"

There is no health bar.

I grabbed my controller and jumped right in, since there was no tutorial, and promptly died. The game is a top down shooter that is very much like a bullet hell game. Shots are flying every which way as you run around killing bad guys and picking up the gold left behind. Despite being horrible at this sort of game I still found it fun and enjoyable, albeit frustrating. It’s a good game to pick up every now and again, especially to play with friends.\n\nThere is a story to the game but I won’t lie, I didn’t pay too much attention to it. From what I gathered there is a rich railroad baron named Cayton Boon and he’s making life miserable so a group of sharp shooters are after him. I am unsure if all of the characters know each or not, due to me not being very good at the game I didn’t progress very far in the story. There are currently three acts to the story and a fourth act coming shortly.\n\nWhere the game truly shines is arcade mode which I enjoyed a lot more than the story mode. You progress through short levels and at the end of each you can upgrade your character, making their shots hit harder or giving them protection from fire. You can also play with a friend go for versus mode, or even hop online to play with others. The game offers a fun experience alone but is even better with others. Whatever mode you play, you have the choice between eleven unique characters. You can use a controller or your mouse and keyboard though I preferred the controller. Each character offers a different play style, some use guns, others use bombs and one is actually a whole regiment of soldiers that loses a soldier with every hit. I loved the variety, however the game has no tutorial or training mode so the only way to learn is through trial and error.\n\nThe game has a decent user interface, but sometimes the text can be a bit tiny, such as when you’re selecting an upgrade in arcade mode. The graphics are great, it’s like a pixelated spaghetti Western in all of its cheesy glory. However, sometimes with all the action going on at the screen at once it can become a chaotic mess and disorienting, however that’s what most bullet hell games seem like to me. The music is very fitting of the game, has a great Western vibe to it and brings the package together well. You can buy the soundtrack separately if you like.\n\nWhile a good game the price seems a bit high for what it currently offers. However, if you find this on sale or in a bundle then go for it. If you enjoy bullet hell style games or top down shooters this should be a fun experience for you. A Fistful of Guns is a campy throwback to old Western films using the modern medium of video games. It’s a great game to play with friends with a lot of variety, it also has Steam achievements and trading cards for you collectors out there.\n\n\nI was supplied with this key by the developer, this however did not affect the review.","May 6","true","11.8"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","15","18","0","1"

Clayton Boon made a deal with the devil to crush anyone who opposed his railroad company, however, "he didn't count on The Righteous Psychosis of those he had wronged" A Fistful of Gun is a fast pace, arcade-style, top-down shooter with a wild west theme. Choose a character, go on a killing spree and ultimately get to Boon. Watch out not to shoot any of the people in the neutral area's (unless you want to earn some extra money or lives), because you will have an unstoppable sheriff after you, or getting thru the next level with a humiliating handicap, like an explosive piñata strapped on your back. It is a difficult game to master, keep your eyes open for scattered power-ups and you might just make it out alive.\n\nAt the beginning of the game you can pick from 3 different characters out of a total of 11 which you need to unlock in story mode, each with their own control set, for example: Noah uses the keyboard, while playing Abel you need an XBOX 360 controller, making it all that easier to play local co-op. Not only are the controls different per character, but reloading is done differently per character as well, making it interesting to try out other characters. A Fistful of Gun allows online or local co-op multiplay with up to eight players.\n\nWhat is most enjoyable, is the game music, it has a certain western/arcade flair.\n\nPROS\n+ Awesome game music,\n+ Fun arcade-style top-down shooter,\n+ Challenging,\n+ Easy controls for local co-op.\n\nCONS\n- Becomes repetitive.\n","November 14, 2015","true","4.1"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","12","13","0","1"

But overall, is mediocre, yet decent for practice, and enjoyable near the multiplayer aspect.\n\nIn Multiplayer, you can connect onto multiple server where player created lobbys can be queued into for Arcade, basically score attack with allies, or Versus, where you and your compadres are to duke it out with random enemies spawning over time.\nI personally found the Arcade quite enjoyable with other, but it's kinda limited to how far you can go scorewise.\n\nAfter every round in the Arcade mode, each player has the ability to chose a perk that will stack or continue on throughout the run. Eventually, preferences will be made on the most suitable, but all perks have some kind of use in the long term.\n\nAs for content, there mostly the eleven characters, the numerous enemy types with different weapons, similarly to the characters, and there really doesn't ever seem to be a "dull" moment in the game.\n\nBest suggested you get some friends together to play through Arcade, and with the different control schemes, the game is readilly available to as many you can cram on the keyboard/mouse or the numerous controllers plugged in.

For starters, some characters are mouse and keyboard only which they should give everyone a choice whether to use full controller or mouse/keyboard no matter which character they use. I do like the different characters they each have different abilities and mix and matching em in a game can either be devastingly bad or overwhelmingly powerfully good lol.

There are lot of things going on, literally. Add that to the fact that some characters almost have the same color of the environment, there is no doubt that most of the time you’ll spend more time trying to locate where character has gone into than trying to aim down your enemies. But even so, the developers did a great job on making each level designs, nothing seems to be exactly the same as the next one.\n\nGameplay  – The game features eleven different playable characters to choose from, which has their own unique ways of controls and attacks. And this makes the game not that repetitive.  There are different modes that you can choose from; Arcade, where you advance through the stages once you’ve completely finished off all the enemies; Story, almost similar to the Arcade but in here, you have the will to choose which direction to go to and there is a story behind; Versus, this where you and your friend(s) or stranger(s) can fight to the death; and then there’s Online, you can team up with other people to progress through the game.\n\nControls  – I think this game balances the use of keyboard & mouse and the controllers. There are characters that are best used with a controller, and there characters that you will probably prefer to be played with your keyboard & mouse.\n\nConclusion  – Whether you’re a fan of single-player games, multi-player, or co-op games, Fistful of Gun will not fail to keep you satisfied.","November 19, 2015","true","4.5"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"

It's a shamanic thing - Naked Shaman\n\nDeveloper: FarmerGnome\nPublisher: Devolver Digital\nRelease Date: 23 September, 2015\n\nDisclaimer: I'm not a Spaghetti Western Fan nor am I familiar with that genre. Just a dude who really enjoyed the short time he has put into this game!\nSo uh … Where do I begin?\nAs we, that includes you as well... Yes you! I’ve seen you! Stop playing the game and read the Review! I know it’s fun and all but … god damn it Bob. Yes go on and shoot some things up … sigh. At least you will read it before you jump into this utterly insane and fun game? Right!?\n\nSigh …\n\nFor everyone who isn’t already trying to put a bullet in Boon’s head I’d say read on brother!\nOr sister?\nWell just read it god damn it!\n\nOh by the way in case you haven't noticed it's published by Devolver so uh needless to stay that the dialogues are ... not for the weak. They're funny as hell though. Others might find them dumb or weird or immature but I like them.\nHey don't judge!\n\nImportant Note: It seems like the achievements are bugged. I've cleared the first act and I survived a Petoye Trip and other things but nothing. I will remove this line once it's been fixed.\n\nStoryTaken straight from the store page:\n\nWhen the evil railroad baron Clayton Boon decided to build a track to Hell, he didn’t reckon on a crazed shaman raising a posse of embittered psychopaths from the dead to stop him. Now they’ll pursue him across the whole Wild West, fighting their way through hordes of bandits, bears, braves and boogeymen just to find Boon and repay their debt with… A FISTFUL OF GUN!\n\nDo I really have to add anything?\n\nGameplayHere we come to the most important part of the game. Yes you heared that right.\nIf you take a good look at the Store Page of this game full of psychos then you’ll see that it says Full Controller Support. Well that’s not true. To quote GLaDOS: The Cake is a LieWell actually it isn’t but let me explain. Whether you play with a controller or with your mouse and keyboard is pretty much up to you. However you’ll find yourself hating either of those options very quickly. Depending on the character you’re playing as at the time. For instance I’m playing Noah, our beloved teacher and shotgun aficionado, with a controller while I’m shooting folks as Abel, the record holder for the most squirrels shot in one season, with mouse and keyboard.\nSo as you see it really is up to you and which option clicks better (see what I did there!?) with the character you’ve fallen in love with you’ve chosen.\nWhy is that so? Well little Jimmy sit down and listen.\nEvery character is unique in his own way and you play each in a different way. For example if you play as Zeke, the deranged sniper, you have to make good use of his cloaking ability and of course his sniper rifle. You’ve guessed that right lil’ Jimmy good! Exactly!\nWhile you run pretty much face first into the bullet hell as Noah, you try the best to stay as far away as possible with Zeke.\nOh and by the way the characters I’ve just talked about are the starters, for starters (horrible pun intended). You can unlock others and have even more fun with them later on. There are eleven unique characters in the game which you can all unlock but you have to make due with Noah, Abel and Zeke. Three crazy psychos which love to shoot things (and squirrels).\n\nModesThe game features different game modes such as Arcade, just kill everything and don’t die, Versus, same as before but vs other people because shooting each other in the face is so much fun!, and a story mode.\nLet’s talk about that one since the others are … what they are, duh!\nSo anyway. After you’ve chosen a character you start on a map, a neutral area. Neutral means that as long as you’re a good boy no one will try to shoot you between your eyes. Then there are other maps where pretty much everyone and everything is trying to kill you. It’s only fair though since you’re trying the same.\nAnyway there’re different kind of special maps as well. For example there’s the, what I like to call Stoner Map, where you end up being high and stoned. Pretty fun.\nOn other maps there are trunks rushing across the screen and everything that gets hit by hit doesn’t live to see another day.\nThe Story Mode is set up in acts. I haven’t beaten the story mode yet so I don’t know how many but I do know that you can move 12 maps/miles before you’re facing a boss.\nOh and the first one is a real WTF!? moment believe me that.\n\nAs you’ve noticed you collect gold which you can use on specific maps to upgrade your character. Be it reload speed, piercing bullets and so on. Everything that you would want. Sometimes the enemkes are dropping Ace of Spades Cards which basically are your Hearts or rather your retries. On some maps you can even buy another Card.\nAnother note to the skills you unlock. Yes they stay unlocked but only for this specific character!\nSo don't be too mad once you bite the dust since you can return far greater and stronger than before!\n\nVisualThe game is neat looking. While the enemies pretty much look all the same, the real eye candy are the bosses (or the big ♥♥♥ Pinata you carry on your head sometimes). Characters, bullets, maps everything does its job and reminds you that you’re in one hell of a western my friend!\nOverall I’d say that the art style does fit the game and give it some kind of (very) unique charm.\n\nAudioWell it’s weird. Don’t get me wrong it’s your typical western music and all dramatic and heroic and awesome and goofy at the same time but … it’s weird. Or rather the uses of the music is weird. For instance there’s a Rock track that I dig that only plays, rather random, when I’m switching maps. So I always sit here headbanging for like 7 seconds before I get greeted by another tune.\nI dig all of them but it’s, at least for me, a bit off putting.\nBut overall it’s quite a fitting soundtrack.\n\nWhat else can I say?The real beauty is in the multiplayer I guess. I mean don’t get me wrong the game’s fun and dope and all but the multiplayer’s where it really shines. I mean you can have up to 9 psychos together and just shooting literally everything. I mean I guess so because I haven’t been able to try the multiplayer yet. I’m looking forward to it though.\nIf you’re a western fan I’d say go grab it. Yes you heared me right El Wizardo go and get it!\nAlso it's published by Devolver so you should know that you're in for a ride and as I said earlier for quite the dialogues.\nOh another important note. I haven't been a victim of any bugs so far. The game runs smooth and as I said so far I'm bug free ...

He is very open and talkative with his fans and took a lot of my pre-release feedback to heart. As a fan I find this refreshing, but also know that because of this it is my duty to disclose that to anyone reading this review.\n\nFistful of Gun is a rampaging, fast paced shooter full of over the top art, unhealthy levels of alcoholism and thirteen people who can inexplicably all ride the same horse at the same time. It makes no sense, its story is threadbare and the entire game is unbalanced to the point where a newbie can steamroll skilled players just by using an OP character... and I love every minute of it.\n\nFistful provides an unparalleled level of co-op support for all kinds of play styles. Every single 'gunslinger' has two methods of control, rebind-able keys and a unique weapon with a series of incomprehensible alternate gun pickups to shake things up. You may choose to play with a controller, mouse, keyboard or keyboard and mouse- you may choose to play single player, co-op, verses, online, offline- through a randomly generated and hectic campaign... Fistful is all about choice. Which is great to me.\n\nThe only downsides I could think to add is more down to the theme than anything else. The wild west is great, but it likely doesn't provide many options for enemy variety, or map settings. I personally would have liked more missions taking place in a town or tavern just to shake the game up a bit. They exist in story mode, but are not found in arcade (which I consider to be the meat of the game). Overall though what is presented is very solid and there are often a lot of surprises (such as bears) which you will love to find out (not like bears) and others which you will have less positive feelings for (mothertrucking bears).\n\nOverall Fistful of Gun is a solid arcade shooter with many surprises to be had. The sound and music is great, the art style is unique and hilarious and overall I personally think it is worth your time.","September 23, 2015","true","15.1"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","11","14","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/NoeLE/recommended/229810/","NoeLE","NoelElbisnes","http://steamcommunity.com/id/NoeLE/","1509 products in account","The very first word you will probably come up with while playing this game is - Stylish. So far, I've really enjoyed it, both Story and Arcade mode (sadly said, Multiplayer part is already dead even though game wasn't released long ago; so if you are up for coop'ing with other players or in contrary playing versus them, - you better find yourself a regular partner).\n\nTo start from a good side, AFoG got really loveable graphics (aside from being just stylish) and represents, if I can call it so, a rather difficult light bullet hell example where you die from 1 shot with nice western touch and fast paced gameplay, even within the Story mode. You start in a town, progressing further by choosing a side to go to [marked with an icon to show the nature of the next encounter], sometimes it may be a saloon or a graveyard, other time it's just vast prairies where you can shoot/smash/exterminate bad guys. Long story short, a lot of things to do, with a similar basis. If you start a fight with civilians, prepare yourself for consequences of getting a "Wanted status" along with some stars, though you can later atone your sins by shooting some more bandits while carrying a heavy pig around (not literally, ouch).\n\nArcade mode, on the other hand, is also a pack of different areas, but without any background story, so you will only need to kill everyone present while picking power-ups and sometimes fullfilling some other [meaningless] tasks, like rescuing those in need of help or moving wagonets from the bottom to the up of the screen. I couldn't play Versus mode, unfortunately, since there was no one else online besides me.\n\nYou can choose from a roster of 11 different "heroes", most with unique gameplay-changing abilities. However, Devs could add not only biography and a list of available weapon looks for each of these, but also some kind of more throughout guide. Of course, it's rather easier to figure on your own, but I'd prefer if "fast paced" thingy wouldn't also apply to How-to element of the game and figuring basics.\n\nAlso, some characters may perhaps need rebalance. For example, there is a chinese guy who launches infinite amount of small and big rockets, which takes incredibly long time to set off and you just need to run around evading projectiles while waiting for some of them to hit enemies. Moreover, there is a unit which looks like a troop with square formation, it moves rather slowly (you can boost the speed for a short amount of time with your right click - banner), but it won't die unless all of the soldiers die, which seems a bit cheating.\n\nDuring my playthoughs, I haven't met any critical or even small issues worth of mentioning. Nevertheless, once in a Story mode I wasn't able to progress past the level and thus lost the game. It was a night themed sneak map with a projector to avoid, but I finished up facing a bandit, who raised the alarm. Briefly, these bandits were simply unkillable no matter how much lead I made them "eat".\n\nSumming up, I can confidently say that Fistful of Gun is an enjoyable experience, which may be worth both your money [better pick it on sale though] and time, but since it's mostly short sessioned game with lots of deaths, try to consider finding a friend to play with or you can throw it pretty soon.\n\nHow do they always say? ----- 8 angry pig riders of 10. -----","November 21, 2015","true","5.5"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

Do you have what it takes to survive in these rough times? You are here to crush Clayton Boon and his Railroad company. But be aware, rumors say that he made a deal with the devil to kill everybody who is dumb or brave enough to enter his eyesight. Be prepared for a spaghetti western full of evil freaks, not-so-evil freaks, whiskey and - of course - bullets. And horses. And...bullets.\n\nChapter II: Gameplay & Mechanics\n\nA Fistful of gun offers (very) fast top-down arcade that demands quick eyes and fingers, name it western bullet hell. Choose one of 11 different psychos, each with a unique playstyle, to release the western town from Boons mercyless grasp. Picking your favourite Psycho might rely on your prefered playstyle: Hide, Kill and Hide again? Choose Zeke, The sniper. Unleash a bulletstorm to saw through hordes of enemies? Choose Duke, the man with the chain gun. To do this, you can choose either arcade, story mode or multiplayer via web or local co-op. Story starts with only 3 psychos available since the others need to be unlocked whilst playing. Moving screen by screen you`ll reach Boons hitmen and finally Boon himself whilst collecting gold, finding power ups, alcohol or even finishing some quests. Arcade let`s you pick all available “heroes”, offering a more “endless” feeling with the chance to set your own personal highscore, that can be compared worldwide. Multiplayer is fun to play, works great and makes the game much more enjoyable.\n\nChapter III: Graphics, Sound & Atmosphere\n\nSoundwise not much to say here: typical wild west soundtrack mixed with the sounds of exploding bombs, srcatching bullets and running horses. I like it!\nGraphics might not be everybodys cup of tea but, again, I love it. Wonderfully crafted pixel art that already offers the charm of a 90s classic. Flashy colours, lots of small details and a nice sense of (dark) humour add to the “spaghetti western”-feeling I mentioned earlier.\n\nChapter IV: Conclusion, Summary & Valuation\n\nLet`s add some negative points here before I valuate. The controls of some playable characters work great with a 360 controller - but not that great whilst playing via keyboard. Vice versa, too. They have to be great because A Fistful of gun can be hard sometimes, even too hard for people who recently started to play. Due to the fact that dying in story mode means starting from the beginning it tends to become repetitive after a while, although not worn off. That said I hope for more active “psychos” for multiplayer. This is not a real negative argument against the game itself but, hands down, A Fistful of Gun is best played in a pack of players, laughing out loud, dying even louder. I hope for a small future discount to attract a wider playerbase.\n\n\nSo, enough explanatory banter! A Fistful of Gun offers hours of fun (and anger), binding you for at least 1-2 hours daily, not to mention if played with friends. Thus said, Multiplayer is highly recommended since the Singleplayer starts to get repetitive unless you try to beat some High Scores.\n\nIndeed, A bagful of fun! 8/10\n\n\nDisclaimer:\nSource of consideration: Farmer Gnome\nKey erhalten von: Farmer Gnome","November 19, 2015","true","4.7"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

The game shines when playing multiplayer, because you can choose a wide variety of characters to maximize your effectiveness in battle. Each character plays interestingly and uniquely. As far as the fact that they even control differently. One character requires that you press the correct key or controller button, corresponding to the next revolver bullet, another can only be played with the mouse, and can teleport to wherever you click.\nAlthough many of these characters can be fun, I feel like there are some obvious choices over others.\n\nThe game is very strategic if you want it to be. You have to think on your feet, and can use cover cleverly.\n\nThere are a few fun game modes to choose from. Arcade being the most entertaining in my personal opinion. Each screen you clear of enemies will grant you the chance to choose 1 random upgrade for you character. It gets pretty satisfying once you've racked quite a few upgrades up.\n\nStory mode also has an entertaining system where once you've cleared a screen, you can choose which direction you'd like to go to next, which determines what next battlefield you will fight on, or could give you an extra life. There are a few other fun mechanics in place, as well a bit of dialogue.\n\nThere's also a versus mode which pits you against your friends.\n\nOverall it's a cool game with some really fun mechanics!","September 24, 2015","true","9.7"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","11","15","0","0"

The action is fast paced and nearly non-stop, and the old west visuals and music are pure awesome.  It has a bit of a retro feel to it as well, like a game Capcom could've developed for arcades in the '90s.\n\nThe gameplay is a mixture of top down shooter and bullet hell, but it isn't the typical shooter, so it might not appeal to those who want to dive straight into the action and feel like an invincible gunslinger. Going in guns blazing will quickly lead to your death.   Unlike most top down shooters, you have to take the time to learn how to play; memorize patterns, learn the controls, and use your reflexes.\n\nYou start out with a choice of 3 characters in story mode, and you can unlock 8 more.  The characters all play a bit differently from each other, which is great, but the controls can be frustrating:   Some characters use keyboard & mouse, while others use a gamepad.  For now I'm looking at mastering the controls for each character as part of the challenge - it's not hard to learn anyway - but I can't help feel that full gamepad support for all characters would make the game better.\n\nPros:\n\n+ Fun, action-packed top down shooting.\n+ Great music and sound effects.\n+ Awesome pixel graphics with a old west theme.\n+ Loads of fun to play with a friend, and almost any game that can be played local and online co-op earns a bonus point from me.\n\nCons:\n\n- Can be a little repetitive.\n- Controls need to be streamlined.\n- The price seems a bit steep.  In my opinion, they should lower it to $10.00 USD.\n\nThis game is a easy 7/10, and something most fans of the genre will have a blast with, as long as they're willing to put a little time into it.\n","November 20, 2015","true","1.7"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","2"

As for the gameplay, it is quite fun and generally controls quite well, except for a few of the characters which can be a bit awkward at least on KB+mouse. I think the biggest selling point of the game is it's eleven unique characters, which each have a very different style and are all fun to play; chances are you will find at least one character you enjoy playing. You can play either story, arcade, or versus mode. Story is single player, and has some rogue-like elements, it's actually something like Binding of Issac in that you have to get through X number of squares to reach a boss, and you have to defeat a number of bosses before you reach the final boss, picking up and buying powerups along the way. As you'd probably expect, the story is about as simple as it gets, it is a standard western revenge plot: the head of a railroad company has wronged you and now you are out for blood. Personally I think most of the replayability lies in the arcade mode, where you must clear out as many of the randomized areas you can either by yourself, with friends, or online. As long as there continues to be an online community I think this mode could have some lasting appeal. As for versus mode, I honestly haven't played it yet, though it seems like it could easily fall prey to unbalanced characters.\n\nThe art style in this game is fantastic, pixel graphics have been done to death at this point but the visuals of this game manage to capture the aesthetic of spaghetti westerns very well, and considering how rare western games are, even in the realm of indie games, I think the style really holds its own. As for the music, from what I've heard I'm not too impressed honestly, just seems like a bit of a mish-mash between retro game music and Ennio Morricone, but it really doesn't have a style all its own like in say Luckslinger, another indie western-themed game, in any case this isn't that big of a deal.\n\nMy Verdict: For a little over the price of a movie, I think you'll probably get your value and then some out of this game, especially if you enjoy westerns or top down shooters.\n","September 26, 2015","true","4.1"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","7","9","0","0"

As you can see from the screenshot it's beatifully crafted, the western theme is well represented in both graphic and music (inspired to Morricone), and it's hard to not fall in love with it.\n\nYou can choose between 11 characters, everyone with a special perk, a unique weapon and a strange mechanics. They can require a controller/mouse only, though, so better be prepared with both. My favorite is "The 13th", a freaking entire regiment.\n\nThere are actually three different modes: Arcade, Story and versus. On the official FAQ they're explained pretty well, so i'm gonna paste the description here:\n\nStory mode (Single only) - The structure of this mode uses the arcade action gameplay and has a dialog system over it with branching options based on choices, most interactions in story mode are encountering traders, different gangs, assisting with quests, bartering for goods and perks, having tense shootouts, doing some bank robberies, assassinations, pushing wagons full of money through Indian territory, stealth missions and getting really smashed on peyote. There are a few more but that covers the basics of it. The over arching goal is to stop the train baron Boon in his tracks through several boss battles. As all the other modes, this one is built procedurally so sometimes the story may be in a different order to the last play-through.\n\nArcade mode (Single and Multi) - Smash through waves of enemies and shoot outlaws to reach the highscore board at the end, you will gain skills and perks at the end of each round and occasionally encounter merchants who sell you weapons, offer you bounties or challenge you to a game of cards.\n\nVersus mode (Single and Multi) - Similar base mechanics to previous modes, versus mode would be best described as competitive co-op, where one person holds the Sheriff badge, and only he is the one who gains skills and perks at the end of each round, the catch is other players can shoot the badge from him and kill each other, its a delicate balance between shooting each other and shooting the bandits. The last person standing with the sheriff badge is the winner. everyone else can take a walk.\n\nThe games works well, with a steady framerate of 120 fps (GTX 970) and until now i had no connection issues with the multiplayer modes.\n\nBe aware: It's extremely fast paced, hard in single, but extremely fun online.\n\nP.S.

It's basically a top-down shooter executed quite well. A single hit will kill your character. There's a story mode and an arcade mode. Both give you a number of lives to retry the level. When you run out, you go back to the character selection screen and start from stage 1. I didn't care much for the story, there isn't much of it anyway. This is definitely not a game you would play for its story.\n\nThe soundtrack was done really well, it feeds the vibe that you're in a Western. The sound effects were really nice too, they fit great with the actions you're performing.\n\nThe pixelated graphics are charming, but at the same time I felt that they were also distracting; mainly due to the colour palletes. My main problem with it was, that because of the amount of enemies constantly shooting at you, it was easy for me to get killed because colours blended in too much.\n\nAlso, it being a top-down game the environmental objects are traitorous at times. Some would block your path, which led me to dying a numerous amount of times. While others are just innocent, and you can simply walk over them. This makes sense if you see a bush that does not block your path, but a wall does. But certain objects which I'd consider as solid objects, were passable as well. This just felt too random at times. And considering the small area of movement, the huge amount of enemies coming at you, and the amount of bullets flying around; you don't have the luxury to think about whether something will block you or not. I think the dev should put more effort into making the solid objects more apparent.\n\nA tip that helped me through the initial frustration: Just shoot up the environment to bits at the start of the stage. I'm very happy to see the dev made it possible to do this. Clearing the area of obstacles, made it a lot easier to move around my character. I also really loved that you can use specific environmental objects in your favour to kill the enemies. There are explosives scattered about, which you can blow up and kill enemies in its vicinity.

It's basically a top-down shooter executed quite well. A single hit will kill your character. There's a story mode and an arcade mode. Both give you a number of lives to retry the level. When you run out, you go back to the character selection screen and start from stage 1. I didn't care much for the story, there isn't much of it anyway. This is definitely not a game you would play for its story.\n\nThe soundtrack was done really well, it feeds the vibe that you're in a Western. The sound effects were really nice too, they fit great with the actions you're performing.\n\nThe pixelated graphics are charming, but at the same time I felt that they were also distracting; mainly due to the colour palletes. My main problem with it was, that because of the amount of enemies constantly shooting at you, it was easy for me to get killed because colours blended in too much.\n\nAlso, it being a top-down game the environmental objects are traitorous at times. Some would block your path, which led me to dying a numerous amount of times. While others are just innocent, and you can simply walk over them. This makes sense if you see a bush that does not block your path, but a wall does. But certain objects which I'd consider as solid objects, were passable as well. This just felt too random at times. And considering the small area of movement, the huge amount of enemies coming at you, and the amount of bullets flying around; you don't have the luxury to think about whether something will block you or not. I think the dev should put more effort into making the solid objects more apparent.\n\nA tip that helped me through the initial frustration: Just shoot up the environment to bits at the start of the stage. I'm very happy to see the dev made it possible to do this. Clearing the area of obstacles, made it a lot easier to move around my character. I also really loved that you can use specific environmental objects in your favour to kill the enemies. There are explosives scattered about, which you can blow up and kill enemies in its vicinity. And certain levels contain tree logs in a running stream, which will kill anything on their path down. You can lead the enemies in their path, and they'll take care of a lot of the mess for you.

These eleven gunslingers and their vastly different forms of attack is what makes this game fun, crazy and downright brilliant. I definitely recommend purchasing this game. Like many roguelites, it is a very enjoyable time sink with a great amount of replayability. FarmerGnome did a fantastic job developing this game and will be a group I will keep my eye on in the future.\n\n==== First Impressions ====A Fistful of Gun is one of the most unique and addictive indie games I’ve had the pleasure to come across. To truly enjoy the uniqueness of each character and his playstyle, it is heavily advisable to play with the intended control scheme (some use a controller while others use a mouse/m&k although you can play all eleven with any control scheme). For example, to shoot as Abel, you need to keep flicking the right analog stick on a controller while for Two Feather, you must press/hold and release a directional button. A Fistful of Gun has an Arcade, Story and Online mode with the ability to have a friend/friends coop with you. In Arcade/Story mode, you have a set amount of lives (which can be gained in the form of pickups) and once used up, it will be game over.\n\n==== Current State of the Game ====A Fistful of Gun is already well polished. I didn’t notice any bugs throughout my play. I do have a couple suggestions that would be nice if implemented.\n\nSuggestions: Allow the ability to change the difficulty level\nAlter entrance topographies so you aren’t immediately pinned in some areas\nInclude an Act select function in story mode (I haven’t managed to get past Act 1 so not sure if already included).\n==== Hardware Information ====HardwareTypeMonitor720p 32 LED TVControllerDS3 (M&K used for this review)MotherboardASRock Z97M AnniversaryCPUi5-4590GPURadeon R9 290XRAM8 GBOSWindows 7\n==== Disclaimer ====A copy of this game was provided by the developer: FarmerGnome; however, this did not bias my review in any form.","November 17, 2015","true","1.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

So when you play the game you don't feel like you're "just playing yet another so and so", it's draws you in.\nThe game play is very fast paced, and similar to games like Nuclear Throne, Relic Hunter Zero and many other such games that have recently showed up on steam (I feel like Nuclear Throne marked the trend, but maybe it's because it was the first such game that interested me, so I didn't notice any before it). What makes the game play in in Fistful of Gun hence force FoG very interesting is the level of variance in each protagonist you play. Many games try to make their characters unique but fail to, this game like Risk of Rain before it has achieved it effortlessly. When you play Arcade mode you can see just how different each one of the heroes is from the others. You have snipers, with strong but slow single shots, you got some aoe champs, you have control champs, you have your gatling monsters, and they all have strengths and weaknesses making them all viable, interesting, and challenging.\n\nThere was one little problem for me, I played the game with a keyboard and mouse, and that made 3 of the characters very impractical, that is the first one, billy and one more, where I have just way too many things to handle in quick succession, and need to move my hand on the keyboard, I'd say a controler is definitely helpful for this game.\n\nI liked the level of customization available for the key bindings, the graphics, and other options.\n\nThere is one little thing that some people might hate, and others might love, I personally found it handy. You can get out of an area by just getting to the exit, I found that out by accident, just by walking too close to the edge and accidentally getting out. Some people will hate leaving a place they didn't want to leave in the heat of battle. But on the other hand it means you can bail out on impossible situations, and also speed run the game (provided you're nimble enough).\n\nPros:  Great look.\nGreat sound effects and Soundtrack.\nVery addictive and unique gameplay.\nChallenging game, it will kick your butt.\nPlenty of Content, achievements and challenges to keep you busy for hours.\nWide range of available customization.\nFull controler support.\nSteam leader board and numerous forms of multiplayer and interplayer competitions beside just score\nMany little touches that show how much time was spent on the game, like the little countdown screens with some hidden details, jokes and funny little exchanges in missions and other goodies.\nCons  I wish loading screens stayed a fraction of a second less.\nSome protagonists are impractical if you do not have a controler.\nThere's no point in counting down when it's game over in Arcade, it's just annoying.\n9/10 highly recommended","November 15, 2015","true","3.6"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

You play as one of eleven characters, each with their own unique weaponry. From shotguns, to pistols, to miniguns, to explosives, you have a variety of different ways to play. You need to adjust your playthrough depending on which character you choose.\n\nThe combat and shooting is very nice. This is a bullet-hell esque game where you have to avoid the enemy bullets while killing the enemy. There are different kinds of enemies that require different approaches; Some enemies are killed with one shot, while others are more tanky and take more than one hit.\n\nOne thing this game could improve on is creating a tutorial, because it throws you into the combat so suddenly. There are no explanations on what you are supposed to do, or where you're supposed to go. The controls could be made a lot clearer. The first few times I died, it wasn't just because I sucked at the game but because I literally had no idea what I was supposed to do. It would be nice to practice my character a bit before being thrown in-game. However the controls are fairly easy to grasp after a few deaths or so since this game is fast-paced, so you get used to what you have to do fairly quickly.\n\nIn the story mode, you start out in a neutral area where you progress by choosing a direction of the screen to go to. You have a general idea of what you're going to do next by the small picture describing what's there. You start with seven lives, and you can gain more by collecting playing cards that you occasionally come upon. You could go to a railroad area, a river, play a card game, meet a merchant, push a cart, save some hostages, unlock a new player, get ambushed, and more.\n\nI know a lot of reviewers aren't recommending this game based off the story mode, but I had fun playing alone. That being said, this game is more fun with friends, so I recommend finding friends to play with.

This game is similar to the old classic arcade game Smash T.V.  and its sequel Total Carnage. A fistful of Gun is set in a western themed world were you have enemies riding on horse back and pig back. This game is a birds eye shooter but instead of firing aimlessly with endless ammo you have to take the time to reload your weapon and in some stages rescue hostages. Even when you're firing a bow and arrow the longer you hold down the fire button the further the arrow goes. In the video I play through two characters in arcade mode and one character in story mode.\nI enjoyed story mode more due to its comical atmosphere. There are long levels with hard end of the stage bosses.  There is a mini game of match making where you can win extra lives. The music in the game is a perfect setting for high paced action and the game  has a high reply value.\n\nYou can see my gameplay on Youtube https://youtu.be/j9wQfu8nc2s","November 15, 2015","true","4.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/excruciate/recommended/229810/","excruciate","Excruciate","http://steamcommunity.com/id/excruciate/","717 products in account","I wanna preface this by saying this is not a bad game as far as most production levels go. Sound, music, voices, graphics, and presentation value are a 10/10. I am on the fence about this game. I was feeling pressured into giving it a thumbs up because 98% of the 53 reviews are all positive, but I don't want to lie about my experience. Some things I love about the game, like how it pays homage to spaghetti westerns which are some of my favorite movies. What I don't like is that the game can have crazy difficulty spikes because of all games that share one thing in common that makes them "NES hard": the controls. I am no slouch in the skills department though, as I have beaten some tough games in quick fashion. Like Risk of Rain. I beat that in 2-3 hours. I even beat House of Dead Ninjas in under 2 hours despite its awful loose slippery controls. There are some even tougher that I have beaten, but then I have seen some people in the forums say they blew through this game's story fast and that it was too easy. I feel like I am missing something yet I know exactly how to play the game.\n\nThe problem for me stems from the extremely fast movement of one of the few characters that I actually like, Noah. He has a shotgun that can mow down enemies if dmg is kept up, but I move so quickly with him it's like he is flying. It causes me to constantly careen into enemy bullets and hazards, especially when there are twenty guys on screen, they all have three-way spread shot, and they all fire at once, covering all available screen space with fire that is impossible to avoid, even though Noah moves at mach speed. It is screens like this that stop a long story or arcade run dead in its tracks, draining every single life that I haven't lost up until then on one screen. Like I said, maybe I am missing something. When I see the leaderboards in arcade mode and the top scores are a million, 3 million, and up, it makes me feel like an A hole. But then again every game has insanely high scoreboard postings so it is expected.\n\nWhat irks me most is in my opinion poorly concieved control schemes for most of the guys. They are well thought but are in my honest opinion poorly executed. I thought I was going to be getting a twin stick shooter when I pre-ordered this, but it is a far cry from one. That surely doesn't make it a bad game, no, but what the game is ultimately is a tip-toe be extremely careful eye twitch type of game.\n\nUpgrades - are offered at random, so if you are 7 screens in on arcade mode and it has yet to offer you a dmg increase, you are in big trouble. That is one aspect of the game that could use a fix big time, if nothing else. The option screen is a mess too. It at first looks like foreign language until I messed around some and finally figured out how to remap my controller buttons. The option screen absolutely needs to be more clear and friendly and there is no ifs ands or buts about that.\n\nSo then I want to get right to the characters and why I hate most of them.\n\n- Noah: Best gun imo but it is offset by the fact that he moves too fast, like he is flying around the screen like a plane in a shmup with too sensitive of controls. If he is slowed down then enemy projectiles will need to be slowed down some also on later stages. As it is, their projectiles are way too fast the deeper you get, eventually coming to a screen where all bad guys have spread and their bullets reach you almost instantly, making dodging bullets a pipe dream. Also his default buttons for both barrels are A and B, which is the worst combo that it could have been because it basically eliminates being able to fire both barrels at once unless you keep your thumb at a uncomfortable angle. I had to remap my controller to make barrels one and two buttons X and A.\n- Two Feather: You fire up/down/left/right with the four buttons on the controller and that is actually fine, but you can only fire one arrow at a time and you can only fire in 4 directions. You can fire repeatedly, but not instantly. There is a delay, which is enough to negate him as being even close to as useful compared to a guy like Noah. Besides, I don't want to mash fire for every single arrow in a shoot-em-up twin stick styled game\n- Billy: Has a good gun, but you have to press whichever button on screen above his head that is showing (X Y A or B), otherwise the gun will just click and another button lights up. The problem with that is you have to keep your eyes on your character the whole time to see what to press instead of being able to keep your eyes on the game. Also, his buttons get messed up from when I had to rebind them for Noah so if I want to play him, I would have to go back into the options and re-rebind the controls.\n- Pablo: This guy is alright, not much complaint for him, other than when you are on the spread of death screen, it is tough to lay bombs and kill guys when you can't dodge the screen filling spread gunfire.\n- Abel: Another worthless character. You have to flick the right thumb stick in the direction you want to fire, one flick for each shot, and he is highly innacurate until you can get accuracy upgrades which come at pure random so you can be stuck with ♥♥♥ accuracy for a long time. The big problem is after you fire 6 bullets you have to flick the right stick six more times to reload before you can fire again. This pause in gameplay creates a window for enemies to quickly fill the screen with bullets. And with that much thumbstick flicking it quickly wore my thumb down.\n- Virgil: Has some kind of weird musket gun that you fire once with right trigger then you have to reload it by pumping left trigger 5 times. You can fire it after any number of pumps but the less pumps means the less bullets comes out which is bad news when the screen is filled with bad dudes.\n- Duke: His minigun can mow lawn but the problem is that when things get tough in later areas and enemy projectile speed gets to a level where bullets reach you near instantly, you are going to die because he moves extremely slow while firing.\n- Tao: Hate him. He can fire small or large rockets. You can lay multiple rockets, but the problem is that the little rockets take 2+ seconds to take off, which can maybe be accomodated for and honed by some players, but just still imo sucks. The bigger rockets are one of the dumbest things I have ever seen, as they sit there for what seems like ten seconds before they fire. By then enemies are long gone and it's 2016 already.\n- Zeke: You L-click to throw knives and R-click to reload them and can carry like 7. Again, having to reload each individual shot in a single shot weapon in a game where enemies don't have to and can fire a unlimited barrage of screen filling spread fire at you make this guy less desirable.\n- The 13th: I like this one. Moves slow but you can R-click to zoom around, pop off a shot, then move again. The problem is that it's a squad of guys making you a much bigger target for the screen filling gunfire and they drop like flies. Still, a much better choice than other guys.\n\nKeep in mind this is all single player. Someone just told me in the forums that they got the highest score on their server with a combination of Duke and Tao, so maybe the characters become less useless if you combine them. I don't know because my review is based off of SP experience. I would play online, but not enough people own the game and online is a ghost town.\n\n6/10 borderline. But like I said, I've beaten some very hard games, so maybe it's just me. Maybe I just can't get the hang of this game. For me personally, it seems like this game is just for whatever reason not falling into my comfort zone no matter how long I keep playing it and based on the mostly positive reviews it really makes me feel like an ♥♥♥ hole but I also can't lie about how I feel just to fit in with everyone else. I mean 98% positive reviews out of 53 can't be wrong, right? I strongly encourage you to buy it and decide for yourself.","September 26, 2015","false","8.2"," 36 of 68 people (53%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","53","36","68","2","11"

Each character has a different weapon, reloading scheme, speed and power-ups.\n\nIn Story mode (from what I can see so far) you choose one of the characters (you unlock more as you progress) and travel through towns filled with enemies in order to get to your destination (what that is I am yet to find out)\n\nIn Versus, although I have not played it yet, I am /guessing/ that 2 players fight against each other with no enemies.

Gameplay is a very fast-paced affair, with the action taking place across many small, action-packed screens. You can choose which screen you want to go to next (based on the direction) and you never know what you'll encounter. Last time around, I saw men riding pigs (haven't passed their outlaw exams yet maybe?) and I'm pretty sure I got drunk, but I don't know how. It all happened too fast. It's also fun to see enemies blow themselves and their buddies up (thanks, TNT) when you're running around like a maniac/strategically reloading.\n\nI like the pixel graphics a lot and the explosions look really nice. Each character controlls very differently (even down to how they reload) so you'll probably have different people finding favourites in different characters. I like Abel and his shotgun the best so far: shoot, run around while waiting for auto-reload, repeat.\n\nI have only tried the Story mode so far (by the way, you have a limited number of lives after which you must start over) but I can only guess that co-op would be a "blast" (hurr-hurr).","November 20, 2015","true","4.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Shoot as many bandits (or whatever else is thrown at you) as you can. However, you only have 3 lives, so use them wisely. It starts off easy, only a few people coming at you at once. You clear the level assuming the next will only be slightly harder, but suddenly you're being bombarded with enemies on horseback, pigs running around, tnt exploding everywhere, and all your lives are gone. It gets real difficult, real fast, so keep that in mind.\n-Story\nI haven't played much of the story mode, but from what I've experienced it's nothing like the arcade. It seems to have a slower, gradually increasing pace rather than suddenly spiking in difficulty.\n-Versus\nPlay against a friend!\n-Online\nMuch like classic arcade, but you can play with friends. If you're going to try out this mode, I reccomend getting a group of your friends together to play, as there isn't much of a player base online at any given time.\n\nCharacter Selection:\nYou've got 11 completely different, yet equally fun characters to chose from. Each one has a different playstyle, appealing to pretty much everything. You've got a guy that shoots rockets, an archer, an army regiment, a sniper, and many more. I started out playing The 13th (the regiment) as it's easy to play, and I'd reccomend that character for beginners.\n\nOverall, it's a great game and I'm definitely going to be playing it more.\nThanks for reading!\n\n\n\n\n","November 20, 2015","true","1.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Fistful of Gun is one of those great arcadey games that work best in short bursts solo, or when playing along with a friend, either on a couch, or across the net with voice chat.\n\nThe game's a blast solo, sure, but the real chaos starts when friends start joining in, and mixing/matching the nearly dozen characters to see what mayhem can occur. With three people, suddenly kinves, bullets, and rockets are flying everywhere, all the players are screaming obscenities, and a half the challenge is trying to remember which projectiles you need to dodge. It's a difficult game, but not due to controls or unfair spikes, more that it's just shy of being a bullet hell at the later levels.\n\nPick it up, grab some friends and controllers, and you'll be laughing for days about just how silly fun the game is.","May 5","true","9.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/uknownuffin/recommended/229810/","uknownuffin","Johannes","http://steamcommunity.com/id/uknownuffin/","493 products in account","A Fistful of Gun is a nice indie game set in the Old West with a ton of characters to play as and, surprisingly, a wide variety of “control schemes” for said characters (something I had never seen before in a videogame).\n\nAfter trying a few, I found myself playing mostly with Abel using a controller. It was quite a thrill, specially since pushing the right analog stick as fast as I could kind of resembles reloading a hand gun and it certainly adds to the fun.  The soundtrack is fine, it doesn’t become repetitive and it fits its theme and purpose of the game quite well, but it’s also not too catchy. I wish the multiplayer wasn’t as dead as it seems to be now, because I would have liked to try it out. The artwork is really good and I’m really digging the pixelated style. However, it is true that sometimes there are too many things on screen and all also kind of similar looking, so it can be frustrating not to know where your character is at some points.\n\nI still haven’t managed to beat the story mode, but I really like how each stage seems to be randomly generated, which really adds to the replayability of the game as you never know which event may show up. One thing that bothered me at first is that there is almost no explanation of what anything is and you kind of have to guess it all. Like… the aces. It took me a while to figure out that they were meant to represent the available lives of my character. Or figuring out who was friendly or not. Or what alcohol does or if there is any way not to die after setting yourself on fire (besides going to the next stage). Maybe a small tutorial or a really small "west encyclopedia" on the menu would be good, although it is not too bad, since after a few playthroughs you start to get what everything is, more or less.\n\nI would definitely recommend this game if you liked some rogue-like games like Risk of Rain or the Binding of Isaac. Although A Fistful of Gun has another approach to the genre, the randomly generated levels, the stage after stage formula and trying to reach the final boss, etc. are some really attractive things that a Fistful of Gun shares with these games. One thing that  is missing though is more “upgrades” to further increase that rogue-like experience of the games I mentioned. You can buy a new gun or upgrade your character, but that is not something that always happens. (I've been killed many times without seeing a single upgrade, sadly)\n\nBesides all this, the game is a lot of fun, the random events are quite diverse and the achievements (which can be quite funny) and cards are just the icing on the cake.  So to sum up, this game is definitely a yes. I’ll see you in the multiplayer, once Fistful of Gun becomes more popular. Until then, keep your revolvers ready and no shooting until the coin hits the floor!\n\nDisclaimer: I received this game for free for reviewing purposes.","November 17, 2015","true","2.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

A Fistful of Gun is exactly that.\n\nExtremely well polished, from interface to art design, AFoG takes you into a mock-Wild West flick full of arcade action. Whereas almost all such shooters restrict you to one control scheme -- indeed, some build the whole game around it --, AFoG allows you to select from a variety of such schemes, and also wildly varying weapons which directly affect gameplay.\n\nCo-op is a great way to play. The various scenarios you will be playing in have varying gimmicks, and are slightly randomly generated. The scenery affects the action nicely, and the existence of power-ups also spices things up. So it has the usual shooter props, plus several great additions of its own.\n\nThe arcade mode is the main attraction, but the story mode makes for a great break, and it's quite different. It adds random events between stages and allows you a limited choice of your next stage, counting down the days until the last shootout.\n\nAFoG is a perfect example of evolutionary, rather than revolutionary, gameplay. It consists of taking something established and old, and polishing it until it shines. And AFoG gleams indeed.","November 21, 2015","true","1.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

When you move from one area to the next you will sometimes find enemies (shot them) and friends (talk to them) and find out what this area can offer you. You will find areas only filled with enemies but also whole cities with different humorous NPC’s and sometimes even special areas where you get for example high and shot on weird looking dudes. Also to mention is that there are many different weapon types and I am sure there is one you like. I myself prefer to use a sniper since it’s very accurate but also the sniper has disadvantages. You better try every weapon yourself. Once you get a feeling for the mechanics (after 2-10 minutes) you will start to enjoy this Game and will lose your feeling for the time. Once you start it many hours will fly by and you will find yourself at midnight in front of your PC.\n\nRating:\n8.7/10\n\nPros:  Different Playable Charakter\nDifferent Weapons\nMap looks pretty good\nFun for a long time\nNo bugs found yet!\nWorks also on older devices\nAchievements\nHumorous NPC’s\nCons:  Some areas are way harder than others and seem kind of unbeatable\nHardware Information\n\nHardware   Type     Monitor  BENQ 24 inch 1ms    Headphones  Apple Earpods    Keyboard  Dell Basic Keyboard/ Integrated Alienware Keyboard    Controller   Xbox-Controller    Mouse   Zelotes T-90     Microphone  Integrated Laptop Micro    OS  Windows 7","November 18, 2015","true","8.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

You get a plethora of characters to choose from. They all control differently from one another as well as far from most conventional isometric shooter controls you may be familiar with nowadays. This is where the skill in the game lies. Mastering each character's control scheme and progressing through the mode of your choice. Arcade mode is really fun since all characters are unlocked from the start and this mode helps greatly with shooting practice but can become rather overhwelming later on. Story mode is a more gradual progression through enemies to eventually get to the big bad in the end.\n\nThe game is tons of fun even though progressing with some of the new control schemes can be rather difficult at times.","November 21, 2015","true","4.8"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

If I ever scratch "build a MAME cabinet" off of my bucket list, this game will find a home on it.\n\nIt reminds me of the old Capcom game Gun.Smoke but way more frantic. There's usually plenty of enemies on screen and one hit knocks you dead unless you manage to commandeer one of their horses. Gameplay is mostly just "shoot enemies and don't get shot" but there's a large variety of maps and some have unique environmental hazards. On Arcade mode you conquer these maps one-by-one and get a power-up as a reward for clearing each map; "Story" mode makes things more interesting.\n\nIn story mode after you complete a map you'll be given the choice of which direction to go, the layout being randomized each time. Each of the directions has an icon that hints to what kind of map or event will take place there. You can collect gold to gamble on cards to earn extra lives, buy weapon upgrades from a gun dealer, or pay your way out of a tricky situation. There are unique events that can occur to keep things interesting and there's "neutral" maps filled with non-combatants. You can murder these people and take their loot, but you may regret choosing to become an outlaw if you run into the sheriff down the road.\n\nDifficulty ranges from challenging to brutal. One map you may find yourself fighting a dozen outlaws, on another a large horde of angry chickens. There's a whopping 11 playable characters to choose from and rather than just being simple skins they have their own unique playstyle. What really surprised me is that they even control differently. Some you may find more suited to a keyboard/mouse (Abel- revolver with six rounds) so you can aim more precisely while others play better with a controller (Two-feather can fire in four directions with the A/B/X/Y buttons or the I/J/K/L keys). It changes things drastically because depending on their weapon you either have to make every shot count or can fire carelessly but have to have to be more precise with your movement.\n\nIt really nails the arcade style. Graphically speaking it has a low-res pixel aesthetic for sprites, but everything else reminds me of early 90s arcade games. Using voice samples in the menus, the sort of lo-fi sound effects, and the game-over screen in story mode where the villain appears on screen mockingly to coerce another precious quarter from your pocket. One of the samples used in the soundtrack sounds straight out of Turtles in Time.\n\nAll around it's a fun, challenging, diverse and charming game.","November 27, 2015","true","5.4"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/aldershot/recommended/229810/","aldershot","[F!] Aldershot","http://steamcommunity.com/id/aldershot/","2454 products in account","Fistful of Gun is a top down arcade shooter that's best enjoyed with friends online or off, though it does support single player as well. It features quick round gameplay, a varied skill ceiling and some eye catching pixel art.\n\nThe premise is pretty simple. Pick from a large variety of characters, who all play very different from one another go out and shoot a bunch of stuff and dudes as the title would suggest. There are 2 main modes with a single and multiplayer variant to them. Arcade mode has you going round to round clearing the screen and at the end of the round you get to pick from an assortment of randomly generated upgrades. In story mode you can play either as a hero, or a bandit. As a hero you'll avoid innocent NPCs while shooting out the baddies. You'll get upgrades if you can find a store keep, or if you're lucky from barrels and crates. While if you play a bandit, you'll be doing similar except you'll be shooting every one, innocents be damned, and collect all the bounty from from your massacres. The balance to playing the bandit is, every one will shoot you on sight, and store keeps are rarer, as they tend to fear and run from you.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ulCE8PyYshw\nThe game's flow is pretty fast paced, some rounds only taking seconds to complete, though there will be a variety different events that may take more time. The game also runs on a limited continue system, and it's very possible to get a game over in your first few runs. It plays a lot more like an arcade classic than a modern game. Permanent gameovers, no quick save or loads, and a limited life counter are rarities in this age of gaming. Because of this, the game does benefit from faster paced style of gameplay, but that also means the game is short, can be potentially repetitive to some.\n\nThe game is a lot of fun, but there are some issues I take with it. Though the character selection is fantastic, and I love how each character are so drastically different from one another the game can feel a bit samey after an hour or two. Even with the character variety you will be shooting and dodging over and over again, with only a handful of random events that help mix things up. To be fair, the game does help alleviate some of the monotony not just with character selection, but also with game mode variety as well. The game's controls can also be an issue at times. Some characters just play better on the keyboard and mouse, while some better on the gamepad, this is mostly due to the huge degree of divergence in the characters' play style. Though this is certainly something to be admired about the game, it also does require the player to have an encumbrance of hardware ready at hand to fully enjoy the game to it's max potential. Also be aware, during our time with the game, we also ran into some bugs as well, some gamebreaking, but since the writing of this review, I have noticed dozens upon dozens of updates. It's very possible they're patched out.\n\nOverall A fist full of Gun is a really interesting top down arcade shooter. It's not perfect, and can be repetitive for some, but it does have a lot of potential, especially if the continue to support the game with more maps, and events, as that's what I think is lacking the most.\n\nPros:\n- Great Pixel Art\n- Excellent variety in character selection\n- Variable skill ceiling\n- Very fun with friends online and off\n\nCons:\n- Lacks variety in events\n- Requires both keyboard and gamepad to be enjoyed appropriately\n- Some re balancing required","September 24, 2015","true","1.8"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","7","12","0","0"

On a foundational level, A Fistful of Gun actually is a good game. All of the nuts and bolts that go into a solid shmup are present, but the developer decided that a classic formula should be needlessly complicated. There are a ton of characters to choose from, but there's something horribly wrong with all of them: Their movement is slow, their range of attack sucks, or their unique control scheme ranges from overly complex to nigh-unplayable. No matter which of the eleven characters the player chooses, he's hobbled in some crucial fashion. As a result, you have a game that would have been fun, were it not for a hackneyed attempt at balance or novelty (I can't tell which concern was at the forefront, but it scarcely matters since attempts at addressing either were clearly in vain).\n\nThat might have been perfectly fine, were this game not challenging enough without the need to handicap the player. You'll be subjected to some rather dense fire as you progress, and the stages are filled with environmental hazards in addition to enemy sprites. There were times when I honestly had no clue what hit, exploded, or in some other fashion killed me. Story Mode is even more difficult. It all adds up to an experience that's more frustrating than it is enjoyable. The player just feels robbed of a good time, having wandered into an unforgiving arena shooter while hamstrung by a character roster that offers a whole lot of nothing. I can tell a lot of good intentions went into this game, but paying $13 for this is a ludicrous proposition.","May 16","false","7.7"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

(♥♥♥♥ them too.) There are several aspects to take into account when making a game. When making a professional game, decompiling Hotline Miami then importing it into Gamemaker Studio and remaking every core function in seperate DLLs because apperently remaking it all is worth the overhead for calling DLLs,  then slapping new graphics onto it and going crazy with the SDL audio libraries is not an option. Considering maybe a hundred people might actually read this, maybe one person out of that hundred would understand anything in that last sentence. Time to stop making development puns since most people don’t ♥♥♥♥ing care. Let me summarize it, the game is slower than a 600lb quadruple amputee in a wheelchair with triangular wheels. (Or slower than you trying to understand a joke as you squint at the screen pointing your mouse at the “This review wasn’t helpful option.”)\n\nThe graphics are garboThis game doesn’t suffer from the classic “improperly scaled pixel art” syndrome suffered by 90% of Unity games like Chroma Squad, but it does suffer from “nothing on the god damned screen” syndrome. The screen always looks emptier than my heart, yet somehow manages to spam enemies on the screen. That’s a special kind of talent where you can look like ♥♥♥♥ from having nothing on the screen but have ♥♥♥♥ on the screen and look like ♥♥♥♥. All the menus look like they were taken out of Clint Eastwood movie menus from the remastered DVD versions, and control worse than them. But that’s for a different paragraph. All of the sprites look up to par with a 1997 coloring book done in Windows 95 Paint, so they aren’t as bad as being a robber caught by Bruce Lee when he’s ♥♥♥♥♥♥, but not better than amputating your arm with a really tight tourniquet because a bear with rabies just ate your hand. So to represent that numerically, 14-129. (Haha! Memes! Randomness!) Normally you use a scanline shader when you have pixel graphics, because you wouldn’t see a CRT monitor with Crysis 3 running, but this game sure takes it up the ♥♥♥ worse than the P90X instructor. The scanline shader also adds dirt on screen, kind of like when a 5th grader is told to make a map look old so they ask their dad to burn the edges and cover it in dirt to make it look old. Anyway, that’s enough ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ on the graphics.\n\nThe menus are laggier than the gameI’m pretty sure my dog could do a better job optimizing the menus, because it looks like they forgot to make a performance report before releasing the game and ended up with about 30 different memory leaks. I get 16 FPS in the menus. I normally can’t ♥♥♥♥♥ about this considering my computer is only slightly more powerful than the Ti-84 you use to cheat on your exams, but I can complain here because I get 60 FPS in game. Why does the game run 4 times better in game? Isn’t there more ♥♥♥♥ going on when the game is running? Even better yet, the options menu gets 1 FPS. Like, no matter what settings the game is on, 1 FPS constantly. I am trying to figure out ways in which to ♥♥♥♥ up a games menu, but I can’t. I literally can’t. I have lost my ability to perceive things the same way as modern programmers. I have lost my ability to even. Time to leave the game development industry and go into something like Astronomy where I know that there will be at least a few people who have the right amount of chromosomes.\n\nThe game hangs randomlyI know that randomly generating a level can be a hard task on the processor the same way it is hard for me to find reasons to continue looking for good games on Steam, but the levels this game generates are about five pixels large. Isn’t generating a level at this point the equivalent of making a few people with Lego then dropping them onto your city-themed carpet from Shaq-height. What is so hard there? Spelunky makes a huge ♥♥♥ level without longer than 3 seconds. This game literally goes into “Not responding” mode every time you change areas. (Which is about once every 20-100 seconds.) It’s worse than running IE 6 through WINE in a Linux Virtual Machine on Windows emulated with a Mac. To quote my previous words from this review, “I literally can’t.”\n\nDid the dev ever take a course on game design or something?Let’s do a quick survey that doesn’t involve your mom’s credit card: do you think making a game with gamepad support but then making some parts of the gameplay mouse and keyboard only is a good idea? No ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥ it’s not. Then why the hell did this dev think that making some playable characters in this game mouse and keyboard only? I don’t want to use my mouse and keyboard, that is why I bought a ♥♥♥♥ing Steam Controller for the couch. Aside from that game design pit, the gameplay is ♥♥♥♥ing stupid. The dev ran over to Dennation games, stole all the source code from Hotline Miami where the character selection screen is, then instead of giving different play styles, they went a level lower. They change the control scheme from character to character. Hope you don’t like keyboard remapping, because no. On top of that, the room gets littered with bullets worse than Yuri’s brother at the end of Lord of War, WITH pigs chasing after you. Then when you die, you get to sit there and watch the countdown because apparently I care.\n\nSmall problems here and thereThis problem is more of a “white girl problem” compared to getting tackled by a bear whose cub you just ate, but the sound is ♥♥♥♥ing atrocious. It tries so hard to sound like 80s arcade games, but sounds worse than Trump when he opens his mouth. That is why I said “went crazy with the SDL audio libraries.” They put it all through some wack-♥♥♥ filter to make it sound weird. Just as a side note, it sounds like someone stapled the performance report on the snare drum so the snare sounds like its being chocked out. Another “small” problem is that the controls aren’t rock hard. In Hotline Miami, the controls are stiffer than, not gonna make that joke, but here they are fairly loose for a twitch bullet hell shooter. At this point I’m scraping the bottom of the barrel to ♥♥♥♥♥ about things, and I think I’m coming up to the review character/word limit, so I’m going to cut it off here.\n\nShould you buy it?If you like ripping hair and triggering yourself as well have more money than know what to do with, then maybe this game is for you. But I still wouldn’t recommend it. garbo","January 18","false","0.5"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","42","5","12","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jtgibson/recommended/229810/","jtgibson","jtgibson","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jtgibson/","820 products in account","I really did want to like this game, but found it far too spastic for my tastes.  I have liked bullet-hell shooters like Toroid Twister and such in the past, but A Fistful of Gun simply strikes me as being too directionless (the Old West has gambling, trains, and dynamite, so we must have random minigames featuring each in the middle of a twin-stick-style shooter) and random (odds are good you will enter circumstances that skill alone cannot save you from).  If it was a little more like the NES Gunsmoke of old with enemy spawn rates that were "hard" but "forgiveable", I may have found it more enjoyable; instead, in part due to the cluttered "single-screen" battlespace and enemy posses in excess of a dozen at a time, characters have a tendency to move so fast that they usually wind up running into the bullets they're trying to dodge in the first place.\n\nIn a word, the game is "busy".\n\nPaul definitely improved matters with a large circle that identifies the location of the player (which apparently was already implemented in multiplayer mode, but I'm too much of an old crank to play with other players ;-)).  That singular change alone tripled the amount of time I can stay alive, as previously I would lose sight of my character (lost in a sea of blue/red/grey/orange/etc.) and then have to try experimental shots to see where the heck I had ended up.  Good on that one!\n\nInstead, I'm now faced with more likely causes of death, in roughly descending order (ignoring the YASD of running into fire):\n\n1) Enemy shotguns.  Terrain and enemy formations tend to conspire together to prevent these from ever being dodged.  Falling back is not usually an option, moving in between the "pellets" is not usually an option, and moving around the blast is not usually an option.\n\n2) About to be wedged in between two bullets and being unable to manoeuvre, especially in circumstances where a rapid-fire enemy is present.  The natural reaction is to try to move out of the way while maintaining distance with the enemy, which inevitably results in simply smashing into one of the two streams.  The problem here is the combination of the bullets moving too slowly in combination with the player moving too quickly.  Games like Warning Forever never tended to bother me in this regard, mainly because the player's ship tended to move at the same speed as the bullets to avoid.\n\n3) Being stuck close to an enemy just before their gun flashes.  Since it is almost literally impossible to track which enemies have fired, this comes as a complete inevitability.  Your pixelated life will flash before your eyes.\n\n4) Being faced with a massed formation of the enemy who are of overwhelming superiority and able to lay down continuous fire.  I've learned to take advantage of the scenery to reduce this, but as the environment is often tight enough to allow the enemies to close in on the player from numerous directions, cover is often irrelevant.\n\n5) Being surrounded.  Obviously the goal is to avoid this in the first place, but it inevitably happens, especially if caught up on terrain -- at which point a loss of a life is nearly guaranteed.\n\nIf this was a hardcore game where you had only one life I'd probably have thrown my mouse through the monitor well within the first few minutes. ;-)  I've nearly broken a controller or two in the NES Gunsmoke, too, but at least that game gave you plenty of opportunity to see one of the half-dozen-or-fewer enemies on the screen well before they opened fire or got into a position to surround you... you had no one to blame but yourself if you allowed yourself to die, whereas A Fistful of Gun seems to rely on the answer of "get better at the game" -- i.e., investing time into a product that just really wasn't for me in the first place. =)\n\nThe game has an excellent thematic 8-/16-bit style, but this is also a shortcoming: it focuses on a single hue on a given screen at a time, a shade of grey, blue, red, or orange with only a few different saturations and lightness levels (I previously called this "single-colour" and that was probably a bit unfair).  This often results in obscuring details, making it very difficult to perceive the threats regardless of how much you keep your eyes moving.  Numerous pixel shaders from explosions and fires can disrupt the edges and shapes on screen, and the size of the enemy bullets' collision boxes is unclear, further compounding a screen that can be difficult to piece anything together.  I'll give that it captures the spaghetti western style, but never in a spaghetti western did a lone gunman have to stand and circle around a massed formation of bad guys, dumping endless amounts of firepower into the mass as if it were a zombie horde.\n\nI am very impressed that the developer is personally attending to each negative review, and tried to accommodate that in this review, but a binary review system is still either "yea" or "nay".\n\nDo I personally recommend this game?  No.  I'm a fan of tactical games, action-adventure games, and roleplaying games, whereas this is a coffee-style shooter.  If you prefer the above to unadulterated action games, this game will most likely simply frustrate you.\n\nCan I admit that this game is very well executed and other people may like it?  Yes.  They did something I didn't like, but did it very well. =)","May 2","false","0.8"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","38","3","8","0","2"

Why? because I didn't fully understand how the game work or what should I do, it's not a complicated game but it is so chaotic. Let's take the characters for example. When you chose one of the characters to play with there are some characters that cannot be controlled with a controller even that the game has a full controller support so you have to plug your mouse and keyboard just to play with a certain character. I didn't like how hard was the gameplay not because it was hard but because I don't think it should be. I'm sure that there are many people who enjoyed it and to be honest it's not a bad game at all it's simply not a game that I would play or recommend.","November 17, 2015","false","6.1"," 2 of 11 people (18%) found this review helpful","18","2","11","0","0"

Instead of making a longer game, or simply making a shorter game that goes for quality over quantity, the developers of this game decided to artificially pad out the length of this game through sheer difficulty. Which is a shame, because otherwise this game would have been decently fun.\n\nAlso the multiplayer literally doesn't work.","April 30","false","2.0"," 2 of 11 people (18%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","18","2","11","0","0"
