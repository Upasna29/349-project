"http://steamcommunity.com/id/chudah/recommended/352130/","chudah","Chudah","http://steamcommunity.com/id/chudah/","1693 products in account","Don't let Locoland's (originally Steamland) dated graphics deceive you, this classic RTS's gameplay holds up very well for a 12 year old relic only now making its way to Steam.  The charming steampunk setting and cute story will entertain you through tough as nails gameplay that is sure to satisfy the most dedicated strategy enthusiast.\n\nTake note that I am generally not one for strategy games, so my opinion may be a bit noobish compared to a genre aficionado.  That said, the gameplay consists of classic strategy fair with the added twist of unit movement being relegated to set rail paths. Keeping this mechanic in mind, you must capture and construct buildings, build your force (in this case trains), complete a variety of objectives, and maneuver your trains in and out of on-rail battles against enemy units that are altogether unforgiving.  Make no mistake, the game is hard, super hard.  Although getting a hang of the controls and hotkeys helps immensely, this isn't a casual title in any sense of the word.\n\nMy biggest complaint is a lack of tutorial.  I spent a TON of time figuring out how things worked and what exactly I needed to do, but perhaps I've been spoiled by the casualness of newer games, even hardcore titles give more instruction than we receive here.  But to its credit, Locoland is from an era when hand holding and player swaddling wasn't a thought in the developer's mind.  Learning to play the game was as much of the gameplay as anything else.\n\nDespite my frustrations, Locoland is a very fun strategy game.  I only wish we were given more graphical options, perhaps windowed mode, but considering its age I imagine it would be difficult to implement or that it's simply not possible.  Either way, strategy fans take heed, you'll want to check this one out.  If you often find yourself reminiscing on the gaming days of old, this is your chance to relive a unique and challenging RTS at a very reasonable price.\n\nBottom Line: Recommended for strategy game enthusiasts looking for something unique and challenging, although a bit dated.\n\nNote - This game was provided by the publisher with the request to write an informative review. No other consideration, compensation or instruction was received.","May 30, 2015","true","2.5"," 91 of 96 people (95%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","95","91","96","4","3"

In Locoland you find yourself on a strange planet inhabited by a robot civilisation at war. Using the planets railways you must fight to protect the harmless inhabitants of the planet from the evil attackers using trains built for war.\n\n+Interesting gameplay, you take control of one or more trains equipped with weapons and you must order them around the tracks present on the map to complete objectives ranging from capturing buildings to destroying other trains\n+Controls are pretty good and the game also gives you lots of hotkeys which you can use to make yourself even more efficient if you have the skill and know-how\n+Very challenging AI though they do follow set paths so it's easy to predict their actions\n+20 missions which is quite a lot considering the price point\n+A variety of different level environments\n+Quite a few different turrets to play around with so you can find your perfect setup for each mission\n+Features trains. I mean who doesn't love trains?\n\n-Very dated graphics though that is to be expected of such an old game and the maximum resolution is 1024x768 which is rather disappointing but again, to be expected with the age\n-Very long build times for trains and turrets which makes the game a lot slower than it needs to be\n-I found the font used in the game very difficult to read\n-The whistle sound effect that plays when you issue a command to one of your trains is rather irritating\n\nVerdict:\nGet it on sale (6.5)\n\nAn interesting train-based RTS game with interesting graphics that provides a good challenge which is sadly let down by how poorly it has aged. If you're a fan of older RTS titles chances are you'll like this one but if you aren't then it's best to wait for a sale.\n\n***This review was written using a key provided by the Publisher for review purposes***\n\nEl K.","May 31, 2015","true","3.4"," 56 of 65 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","56","65","0","4"

Cherishing the ancient “Golden Gear” relic as their ancestors have, unfortunately the evil Khon-Kaa-Doo has other things in mind. On a beautiful night, he sent his troops to steal the relic. From now on, your mission is to get it back!\n\nAn interesting strategy game involving trains as your main units. Building wagons containing canons, artillery, missiles and more to destroy the enemy’s forces. Make sure to build plenty of engines to pull or push your trains into the enemy territory. No good building an arsenal and being as slow as a snail!! This game is all about the manoeuvrability of your trains and how efficiently to attack the opposing forces.\n\nYou really need to study the movements of the enemy trains in this game to beat each map. I personally enjoy the diversity of the train tracks; each map has a different layout. Day, night and weather condition the like of storms or Volcano showers will keep you on your toes.\n\nIn terms of graphics, they are cute and fun. Good control commands and easy to master. The music fits well with the game but I must admit the sound of the whistle every time you move your trains is a bit much.\n\nYou have 3 types of difficulty; easy, normal and hard. I would suggest starting on the easy level to get the feel of the game.

Unique and enjoyable with a great art style.\n\nI was provided a key from the Developer\n\nI quite enjoyed this game, as a long-time fan of classic RTS titles. It makes for a refreshing change in the genre by taking well known gameplay elements and adding a twist to the movement and management.\n\nWhilst an older game, it holds up well despite a lower resolution than you would expect to see these days (something that I found pleasing in a nostalgic way). The gameplay is solid, each unit is unique and can be utilised to render different attack and defence patterns. Enemy AI is about what you would expect from an RTS, challenging but predictable.\n\nThe art style is interesting and for the most part very effective, although in some instances can make elements on screen a little hard to pick out. That being said, it suits the game well and immerses you into unit management nicely.\n\nWell worth a play if you are an RTS fan looking for something a little different in that genre, or just an indie game fan that enjoys a smaller, less frantic game from time to time.","May 30, 2015","true","3.6"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","2"

This is the sound of the newest addition to the TD genre.\nLocoland is quite a bit of fresh air and something to consider buying.\nDeveloper: Gromada, Buka Entertainment\nPublisher: Buka Entertainment\nRelease Date: 28 May, 2015\n\nThis Review has been written with a Key from the Developer\n\nLocoland is a weird game. It’s weird to put in into just one category but if I had to choose one it would be probably Tower Defense … but then again it’s not a TD game. I mean take Sanctum for example. It’s a straight TD game mixed with FPS. This game on the other hand … well let’s just call it a … TRAIN TOWER DEFENSE GAME!\n\nI’ll explain why I think that would be the best genre for it at this time.\n\nSo what is this game about?\nYou start as an Engine, the part of the train that can actually move around and you have to connect gun parts to it in order to destroy the boulder and to advance. You can add various Guns to your Engine that will add firepower to you Train.\n\nSo you get the idea. It’s basically a TD game in which the towers are actually moving. But so do your enemies. You’ll have to capture Factories in order to rebuild a destroyed Engine or Gun and then there’s also a Repair Depot which actually lets you repair your damaged Train parts.\n\nThe enemies are moving as well and you’ll have to get close to them so you can let your Gun parts do the talking.\n\nYou’ll encounter neutral Trains as well and if you manage to destroy one they drop some cash on their death and if you collect it you can use it to build some new parts for your Train depending on the situation.\n\nThe whole thing takes place on various different maps and settings.\nOverall it’s quite a pleasant surprise … I mean it’s a whole new experience and it’s not your average TD game. Usually you place your towers somewhere and that’s it.\nIn Locoland you actually move your towers around in order to defeat your enemies\nSo that’s quite a bit of fresh air.\n\nWhat else can I say?\nLocoland is not a game for everybody … BUT! If you happen to like Tower Defense Games then I’d say it’s worth picking up if you are searching for a whole new experience.","May 28, 2015","true","2.1"," 20 of 29 people (69%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","69","20","29","3","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tosterx/recommended/352130/","tosterx","TosterX","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tosterx/","968 products in account","Locomotives and Happiness = Locoland :)\nLocoland is a retro indie game about the world of steam trains from wonderland and our opponent who has stolen our most precious diamond, The Golden Gear. The game is a combination of Tower Defence/Strategy Tactics. You always need to analyse the situation with the opponent and take the best way to get through the mission.\n\nSo I'll descrive you the first three missions. You start the mission with a locomotive + two gun trains and you need to be fast with your decisions. In the war of trains you need two things - the factory and repair building which usually is near the starting point. At first you need to build your gun trains from the money you start the game with. The locomotives are also important cause they power the trains. After you have some army you can go into some battles to destroy the opponent or just some of his trains. In every battle you can lose your trains so the repair building helps you with war damages. The factory is building trains at the same time so you can therefore connect them into repaired group or attack the opponent from other side. You need to remember - your opponent is building trains at the same time and he can attack you as well. Besides destroying the opponents army you have to destroy the factory/repair building in the opponent's base (if he owns that).\n\nThe game is therefore about who is the strongest on the map. There are 20 mission points and every one is different. The money you have in the game is a static number for every mission. I discovered one way to earn extra money - you can destroy the passenger train which is neutral in the game and sometimes drops the money. You need to know that some of the missions doesn't have factory and repair building :) After every mission you're calculated with the points earned in the battles.\n\nTo summarize, it's a enjoyable game which will lead you to many thinking hours on how to pass that train and complete the mission's objectives :)\n\nWhat could be better and fixed in the game:\n* in the game you are introduced into the storyline but there's no tutorial to get to know the controls - they're listed in options\n* sometimes it's hard to see the trains when they're behind the environment. It would be great to see border of the hidden train\n* if you create a lot of trains, highlighted is only the selected one so it's hard to discover the connected/unconnected trains when there's many of them\n* the game uses the maximum resolution of 1024x768. I'd recommend creating windowed mode for that small res\n* i have only 23 FPS while the GPU's usage is about 10%.. weird?\n* alt+tab makes the game unplayable\n* if you own double monitor - moving the mouse outside the game window gives the same effect like with alt+tab; but also when you get out of game, your opened windows are confused :)","August 18, 2015","true","2.0"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","2"

This game is cute, different, innovative and imaginative.\n\nGraphics while cute and visually appealing are restricted to 4:3 perspective with 3 selectable resolutions 640x480, 800x600 and 1024x768.  The art work is cartoon like with surreal colours and shading and would be at home in any children's story book.\n\nGame sounds are atmospheric but can be hard on the ears at higher volumes.  The music is a variety of sequenced loop samples with arrangements hovering between circus music and new-age or pop.  Some of the sound loops clip between loops giving pops or distortion.\n\nThe user interface and menu system are usable, but are a little on the rough and ready side.  Some text story are grammer bad with spilling orrers (sic).\n\nGame play starts off simple with missions becoming more complex and fast paced as the game progresses.  The user gets a factory which can build locomotive engines, Gun carriages, Mortar carriages and Missile carriages.  There is also a repair facility where damaged trains can be repaired by driving through.  Enemy AI gets similar facilities.  The player needs to clear obstacles, navigate complex train track lay-outs and eliminate enemy trains and facilities.  While repetitive (like tetris, galaxian, space invaders or pac-man) the game keeps the player hooked with escalating pace and complexity with plenty of challenge and demanding spot decisions under pressure.\n\nOver all Locoland is a fun to play arcade game (with good re-play value) which is family friendly and should appeal to casual and arcade gamers of all ages.\n\n7 / 10","June 2, 2015","true","3.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

A surreal landscape which you battle across on trains isn't something you get to play everyday. Sadly, despite the game's strong visual appeal the game play falls apart quite quickly. Tutorials leave you painfully unaware of basic mechanics, such as reloading train cars via the repair station. On only the third level it became apparent that the computer has infinite resources as well as the ability to repair their warehouses for building more trains. A very frustrating fault since I was forced to constantly retreat to retrieve more ammo for my trains while the computer simply built more, restocking their forces by the time I returned and drawing out the level far longer than need be. Often I also struggled with getting all my train's guns to fire consistantly, adding to the frustration of taking down the computer's few remaining units. Also, the incessant tooting sound effect of the train's whistle will slowly drive you insane.\n\nPros\n-very beautiful look\n-quirky fun story\n-unique approach to RTS\n\nCons\n-unfair AI\n-frustrating under explained mechanics\n-lack of meaningful control during combat\n-toot toot toot\n\n\nDISCLAIMER: Review is based on approx. 1 hour of gameplay.","June 15, 2015","false","1.3"," 11 of 31 people (35%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","35","11","31","0","1"
