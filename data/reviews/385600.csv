"http://steamcommunity.com/id/AroNocebo/recommended/385600/","AroNocebo","- Aro -","http://steamcommunity.com/id/AroNocebo/","415 products in account","We'll get the elephant out of the room first: Heavy Fire: Shattered Spear is an on-rails shooter, a genre that might not be incredibly popular with PC gamers, but can be fun when done correctly. Just for those of you that don't know the term, an 'on-rails shooter' game is a form of FPS but without the ability to chose where you move, only where you aim.\n\nIn my opinion, Heavy Fire: Shattered Spear is one of those titles that does a good job with the genre, Heavy Fire: Afghanistan was equally just as much fun, though this installment definitely adds more for your money in terms of gameplay variety. Some examples of the additions Shattered Spear brings to the table is the ability to pilot Commanches, Bombers, Tanks as well as simply being a heavily armed marine.\n\nThe gameplay is what you would expect from any typical on-rails shooter, it is very arcade-like, fast paced and very challenging (in some missions at least). A perks system gives you the ability to unlock new weapons to use, health and ammunition bonuses etc. Nothing fancy or unique, but it's a nice touch.\n\nVisually, the maps are really well done creating a very immersive and grim atmosphere, as you would expect in 2011 Afghanistan, the sun is blazing making it difficult for you to get a clear view of targets and there is heavy enemy fire coming from all corners of your view. This adds to the challenge factor, though it can be a little tedious as the aiming itself is a little finnicky at first, but in conjunction with the simple controls, you master the aiming mechanics fairly quickly.\n\nThere aren't many faults with this game in my opinion, just some minor things like small grammatical errors in the campaign dialog and some questionable voice acting, not to mention the anti-climactic death sequence, but that's about it, nothing ultimately hurting the fact that it's a fun game.\n\nAs I said in my review for Heavy Fire: Afghanistan some time ago: This is a fun game if you know exactly what it is that you're about to buy. It's not a typical FPS, it's an on-rails shooter, don't buy the game and then complain about this via a negative review when it is clearly advertised as such. It's cheap and it's fun, more than enouch reason to recommend it to others.","December 6, 2015","true","6.3"," 18 of 18 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","18","18","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/vicrabb/recommended/385600/","vicrabb","Vic=HKC=","http://steamcommunity.com/id/vicrabb/","1793 products in account","The game puts you in the shoes of several peoples: a spy (for the tutorial), a ranger, a chopper pilot, an airplane bomber and I hope I didn't forget anyone. You're in the Middle East/Asia: Iran, Afghanistan mainly. Your goal is to stop enemies to launch a nuclear rocket.\n\nIt's a rail shooter, meaning that you have to concentrate only on shooting and protecting you... and reloading (and avoid reloading in sequences where the game doesn't let you cover). Checkpoints are used to save your progression, should you die, you can respawn at these. Should you quit the level, forget about your progression.\n\nEvery two missions, you're unlocking a new point to spend in armory: more ammo, another gun, more health, etc.. I don't know if it was intended that finishing a mission giving points more than once can make you upgrade faster but I've used that to make sure I can live in the next levels.\n\nAlso, during missions, you have to make some Quick Time Events by pressing buttons... like A, D, S and even W despite not being used for going forward. The best is that you don't have always time to press them: game over or important loss of health. The problem with AZERTY keyboards is still there as ADS aren't on the same line. Besides, avoid controller. I've tried to play with it and it's not natural AT ALL to play with it. Stuck to keyboard/mouse.\n\nYou have two modes: Rookie and Veteran. The only change is the visual settings: more sun for example to blind you. And you can't find as often the medikit or the ammo needed (because you have to shoot them to take them).\n\nGraphically, it's ok. Though I would have preferred not to have it saccaded. I don't know if it's Windows 7 or if it's my graphic cards that make it stuttered or make it in tune with the music but after a while, you don't see it anymore.\n\nAlso, the chopper sequence is easily my favorite. It's nice, without real dangers, even in Veteran, as rockets are infinite. And being in the bomber is also a good change.\n\nThe game is good, entertaining and provides a challenge in Veteran. If anything, you're not robbed.","October 26, 2015","true","6.4"," 14 of 17 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","14","17","0","0"

I'm playing it on an alienware alpha using an XBOX360 controller, and have not experienced any problems to date.\n\nYes, you don't have a gun to play with, but the using a controller works. It takes a bit of time getting used to, but it's not that difficult to get there.\n\nIn my opinion some of the negative reviews are a bit harsh.","December 5, 2015","true","0.7"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","6","7","0","0"

The story is more interesting and memorable than the first installment, and there is more variety in the missions (which was already pretty good in the first one) and equipment you use. So far so good.\n\nThe problem I have is in a rail shooter your lack of control of where you move is fine if your character acts sensibly, but can quickly detoriate and feel limiting if not. In this case you character regularly wanders out halfway down some stairs into enemy fire with no cover, gets ambushed almost every scene of the entire game, and generally acts more as if he was some experimental prototype terminator virtually immune to small arms fire rather than as a soldier that really would like to live though this campaign.\n\nA new gameplay element added makes this worse - in the first game you have white cover arrows that appear at the bottom of the screen so you can hide from some or all of the enemies on screen. Shattered Spear has this still, but frequently the left and right arrows are not cover, but anticover - you have managed yet again to walk into a trap and are being shot at from point blank range by enemies on 2 or three screens at once, for 180 degrees of bullet sponging, often with no actual cover at all. To make up for this there seem to be med packs virtually even screen.\n\nOn the plus side Quick Time Events now kill you (or at least do a lot of damage), rather than being largely for show - I am not a huge fan of QTEs but if you have them in they should actually be required, not just a points scoring exercise that can be ignored (as in the previous one). As mentioned the story is much more interesting and memorable, and there are a number of set pieces that are well done (except the dam bursting).\n\nThis is very much a "maybe" game, especially given the limited price tag, but in this case I think I will go with no - it is better in most ways that its predecessor, but ultimately when you take control of the players movement for them, you can't abuse that to force them into stupid positions over and over, it just becomes very irritating and immersion breaking.","February 23","false","7.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It is similar in quality to the Rambo on-rails shooter video game that came out some time ago.  Dialogue is clunky, the story isn't engaging, aiming and the "feel" of the guns is off.  It probably doesn't help that I played a much better on-rails shooter (Blue Estate), but this game is a harsh step backwards.\n\nThe only saving gracy(?) is that it is cheap.","February 8","false","16.2"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

The game is terrible for what it is, does, and even stands for. They lure you in with the thought of "Infiltrate a base" and blah blah blah. This game, its screen shots are lies. This game is a peek a boo game. Meaning you literally jump out of cover, shoot, go back into cover and pray to God you hit something wtih your guns. The sounds of the guns are laughable. Cover? Oh im sorry. Did you mean the thing that you go behind to save your life and make sure the enemy doesnt hit you? Sorry, the cover is only available at certain parts and doesnt help much if you have guys on other places and levels of height. You might think "Oh height? Isnt that what happens in real life?" Yeah, but the people dont DUCK 4 inches down and say "I'm safe." The game has QTE events that are just...Why? WHY?! I played 20 minutes of this game and I requested for a refund. Its a terrible game. The guns are so stupid looking, sounds stupid and even one level says "Stay quiet" before you get shot at by a company of enemies. Remeber, this is an on rail shooter, meaning you cant get caught unless you do something stupid like shoot randomly or the game just says "Be quiet...NOT." Stay away at all cost! The game looks great in the screenshots but upclose? ITS A MESS! STAY AWAY!","December 2, 2015","false","0.4"," 0 of 8 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","8","0","0"
