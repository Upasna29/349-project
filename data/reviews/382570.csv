The game seems to be influenced from classic titles such as Orcarina of Time on the N64.\n\nThe game took me about 3-4 hours to finish, although short I do highly recommend purchasing this game.\nIt seems basic at first but give it a chance and you find yourself pleasently suprised with what it offers you.\n\nSo after starting (I won't ruin the other thing that happens :P) you will find yourself feeling like Link, minus the green, the sword, the flute, and you seem to be a bigger version of his fairy.\nAlot of the beginning if traversing through some basic landscapes and getting introduced to the controls and certain elements of the game you will be seeing.\n\nAfter a while you will notice you are picking up some glass wings that Mayfly lost in the beginning, collecting a number of these will start to give Mayfly some interesting abilities. A good point to make it once you acquire a new ability, you will find you need to use it quite often, unlike other typical games where you may only use it for the area you are in and then barely ever again. I find it nice where the game will build on what you have and force you to use everything to get further.\n\nUsing 'tools' you will find along the way you will be required to use them to help you solve some puzzles and continue through the game. You cannot put away items and you can only hold one item at any given time. Be aware that certain moves will cause you to drop your weapon, which is a nice feature.\n\nPuzzles in the game are pretty clever and fun to interact with, I found myself rather impressed by a few of them. They will make you uses tools as often as possible, one in particular has a feature I didn't expect.\n\nThe landscape has some elements that will block your path or try to hinder you in certain scenarios, you will come across electric orbs and flooring, sludge, thorns and a couple of others. In certain scenarios they will be more annoying that others.\n\nMonsters in this game are all dino-like, and they vary a little bit. Every monster is this game has aim hax (not kidding xD), stay clear as much as you can, although they will come for you within a certain distance. You can kill monsters (more effort than it's worth), but after a while you do get a nice health bar, also there is plenty of health around so you shouldn't die to monsters really.\n\nThe game's landscapes and levels are very nice and well thought out. The music is very nice to listen to and I found that each track suited the part of the game it was assigned to. Also I found the boss monster to be very impacting on this game, it made me want to run away all the time, maybe due to the first encounter you have with it.\n\nOverall I think this is a very nice game to play and you really feel you are playing something from the 90's, if you grew up in that period of time you will really enjoy this.\n\n\nPros\n+ Simple game that feels like a blast from the past.\n+ Will keep you playing, keeps adding new elements to stop the repetitive feeling.\n+ Interesting move set which you will enjoy using.\n+ Easy controls\n+ Great soundtrack\n+ If you grew up in the 90's you should enjoy this\n\nCons\n- Monsters hack :(\n- The big monster also hax ;__;\n- I got some slow down, usually when initially running the game, doesn't ruin the experience though.\n- A single glitch is on the 3rd last section, there is an error message and you will not lose progress.\n- If you are a graphics gamer (you know who you are) you might not appreciate this game.\n\n8/10 :)","June 25, 2015","true","3.2"," 44 of 56 people (79%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","79","44","56","6","0"

The primary use of the scythe is to hack away tall grass which, paired with the pots and the health icons, makes it clear that the game was heavily inspired by the Legend of Zelda series.\n\nGlass Wing alternates between tricky platforming sections and "find the proper tool for the job and figure out how to use it" puzzles. Some of the platforming sections took me more than one attempt, but they weren't frustratingly difficult. As you progress through the game, you gain new platforming abilities, and since the developers know you have the ability, they designed the rest of the game with them in mind which makes things trickier as you go.\n\nAs for the puzzles, some took me a while to figure out and started to cause frustration, but once I figured out the solution they seemed rather clever. There are also monsters and they can be killed, but there is little point in doing so and they do not go down easy, so it's best to do as the game says and avoid them.\n\nThere are no collectibles or extra routes, so you're likely only going to make one run through and that should only take a few hours (less than 5). Still, I had fun during my time with the game, so if you aren't scared off by the visuals being what they are or the risk of finding the puzzles to be "too obtuse" rather than "clever," Glass Wing may be worth a go.","June 26, 2015","true","3.2"," 17 of 19 people (89%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","89","17","19","2","0"

The launcher and controller configuration utility is broken it is so hard to use.  The camera is also very hard to control.  It feels more like a super early alpha than anything.\n\nHowever, the chararacter movement and animations are well done and it actually feels like you are playing Mario 64.  If they can make the early levels a bit more easy to digest it would be a great little game.  I found myself lost and confused early on.  I'm not sure if I was heading down a dead end or not, and there is an impossible room without any real instruction.  But I could have just been missing something.\n\nI'm going to give the game a positive review but if a few months from now if the controller configuration menu is still broken I would have to say it's something worth missing out on.  They are on to something good here and I hope this evolves.\n\nMe stumbling around, lost and confused:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9bhYjOagCE","July 1, 2015","true","0.7"," 22 of 31 people (71%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","71","22","31","3","7"

I would, and DO recomend this game! The artwork is beautiful, I have always loved the older game styles of the N64 and the GameCube, and this game brings that back to us. As someone has already stated, the AI is a little overkill, but that's like that for a reason.\n\nNow like any game it has its kinks, and not any of the good kinds. The controls were a little wonky for the keyboard at least. Let me tell you now that H is the use key (there may have been other keys for the use button! I just got frustrated at not finding them quick enough and changed them quickly), and like most Indie games, it's not flawless and its definately not seemless. However even the fact that it's not seemless brings back some old memories of how the older games used to be made. Also like most Indie games, from what I gather, this is also a fairly short game.\n\nNow the wonky controls can easily be changed. When you go to start up the game it will ask you if you want to start the game or configure controls. BE WARNED! When you change your controls, it wasn't set up 100% accurately. When you assign the Left and Right keys, switch them around. It assigns the Left key to the right and vice versa.\n\nSo whether it be for nostalgia of older style games, the art work, looking for a puzzle and/or platformer, or even just looking for a game to blow your last $5 on, I highly recommend this game!\n\nOne last bit of advice if you get the game, Look everywhere, Avoid everything.\n\nFinal Rating 9/10\n\nNote to Developer: This game truely is amazing, music included. If you could put out a soundtrack for sale that would be fantastic! And thank you SOOOO MUCH for puting this game out! This really is a piece of art! I look forward to more games from you in the future from you!","June 28, 2015","true","6.1"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","10","13","0","0"

Quite possibly the only thing good about this game is the music and the main character design- and perhaps how it forces the player to explore and learn the ropes of the game, but it doesn't explain ANYTHING to you, the only brief explanations you get in a sentence or two in the start about how to jump and change the camera a bit, and maybe how to use the powerups you get throughout the game. When fighting mobs, I wasn't sure if I was ever even doing damage, and I'm still not sure- even though one of the items you can pick up is a sword. The physics of this game are wonky, and the jump is odd as you can get to areas you're clearly not supposed to get to without an item once you get certain powerups. I would not find it surprising if someone had to watch a guide on how to do a few of the puzzles, as some of them are quite bizarre, like the one with the spear and the plant. The character doesn't really match in with the areas, which is okay, I wasn't too picky about it. The platforming is terrible in this game, to be honest... The camera never wants to show you exactly what you need to jump to next- and you need to jump quickly in some areas, and the platforms always move too quickly, meaning you need to have a fast reaction speed or alot of patience, becuase you will end up doing the same things multiple times.  5.5/10, a decent way to spend an hour or two of time if you don't mind getting scared by loud noises in the first three minutes of the game. Would only buy it if it's on a huge sale.","September 29, 2015","false","1.2"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","8","10","0","0"

You get many abilities throughout the game and most of them are really useful. You collect your Glass Wings and everyone you collect gives you health and sometimes an ability. The controlls are fine, I wish there was an easier way to change them but there isn't. Auto jump sucks. There is no point to change the controlls anyway, it doesn't seem to keep the changes you make (Scratch that! It was user error not game error!). The end portion of the game is a little annoying, it will take several times to do, and ontop of a known glitch in that part, can get a little annoying.\n\nTL;DR Its a fun game, its worth 5 dollars.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Tamloo/recommended/382570/","Tamloo","Tamloo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Tamloo/","240 products in account","I originally bought this title at full price ($4.99). I played about 2.4 hours until I got stuck and frustrated at the very end of the game and returned it. I just bought a bundle that has included this title so I'm finally able to give this game a review!\n\nPros:\nSmooth(ish) gameplay comparable to Mario, Banjo-Kazooie, Metroid, and Zelda.\nHeavily borrows many elements from the above games\nSomewhat great story\nEnjoyable (but forgettable) music\nSurprises you in ways you didn't think it would throughout the game\nAutojump (for the flying glitch)\n\nCons:\nToo short (and in my experience impossible)\nEmpty worlds\nToo expensive\nRehashed levels and puzzles.\nAutojump (for the the times when I really didn't mean to jump or want to fly)\n\nI'll be honest, this game isn't that bad. The game plays very well and I enjoyed it a lot! And to say this game was made in Gamer Maker impresses me! However, this game isn't without it's faults.\n\nThe enemies in this game are completely optional to kill. You just need to run past them. I attempted to kill one of them... I finally succeeded, but I wasted about 10 minutes of my time as they didn't reward me in anyway. The worlds feel completely empty with nothing to collect and the puzzles get rehashed over, and over. This game is comparable to Banjo-Kazooie..... that is if you take out the fun characters, objectives, open world, and collectibles. This game also loves, loves, loves, LOVES it's Super Mario Sunshine platforming stages as it throws the stages against you multiple times throughout the game.\n\nThis title had it's moments. But the longest stages for me in this game were the times when there were VERY precise jumps that I would have to try again and again and again to make. This combined with rehashing level designs is artificially making this game feel longer.\n\nOh, and be warned... this game has an auto jump that is comparable to Zelda. But to be honest... I didn't mind this feature too much as I had to do some back tracking as I missed one of the few collectibles in the game as I glitched through one of the early stages thanks to the auto jump. And due to this game rehashing some of the same level designs for a while, I was able to pull this glitch off and skip many tedious parts of the game.\n\nFor some reason, despite all of this, I somehow enjoyed the game. Would I recommend this game? Absolutely!....... at a cheaper price. This game is not worth $5. I would only recommend this title in a bundle or if this game goes under $1 in a sale. Just be warned.... there is a glitch at the end of the game that refuses to let you past a endless revolving door after a certain rehash of a certain stage.","July 14, 2015","false","4.2"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/webbing10/recommended/382570/","webbing10","Stonium","http://steamcommunity.com/id/webbing10/","303 products in account","So I start up the game and configure my controls, only to find that left and right are swapped, for some reason. I start my review with this because it is the first of many things that show what a mess this game turns out to be.\n\nThough let me get the positives out of the way. Firstly, it looks ok. While this would normally not be a compliment, I am used to these kinds of graphics from a mediocre Unity game, not something made in Game Maker (I only figured this out when I got to the ice section). Also your character has a metroid ball with working bomb jumps. Finally, the music is kinda cool.\n\nHowever, despite those positives, it seems like the developers, despite knowing how to code, have zero experience with game design. Firstly, the difficulty goes all over the place, with it's apex in a desert level in the middle of the game, and it's nadir right before the end. Second, while the graphics look kinda nice, there is no artistic cohesion, one minute you are in a forest, and the next a factory jumping from logs to metal boxes and it feels very disjointed. Thirdly there are several Gamemaker 3D specific problems. You can't customize the graphics, the character's shadow stays the same size, but magically disappears after a certain point, the camera loves clipping through walls, the camera starts out incredibly zoomed in, ice doesn't reflect properly (that's how I figured out it was Gamemaker), and you clip through the world in the final level (the untextured skybox is an ugly color).\n\nThese minor complains could all be forgiven, however, if the gameplay was any good. I can understand why people compare it to an N64 game, there are only 4 buttons for everything. The problem with this is that approximately 100 percent of your useful actions are bound to jump or spindash, causing you to become a ball when you meant to spin. using your items is awkward because the character has the reach of a 4 year old and it's not clear if you need to get closer to hit thorns or if they will hurt you. Your character moves at the speed of butter in a freezer and flying is the most awkward experience ever, due to your ability to easily fly backwards and upside down. Worst of all, though, if you manage to die, you go back to the needless interactive menu and, once you load, to a checkpoint that could be up to 10 minutes away, even in a best case scenerio, the time to recover is at least 20 seconds, when it could be 1-3.\n\nThe puzzles are a myrad better in that they are merely bad. Some are ok, but others are just "use item at a location" and the actual puzzle is just finding where to go. Honestly, though, they aren't worth getting the game for, not by any stretch of the imagination. It is like buying Metroid for the puzzle of "shoot red door with missile."\n\nIt's clear that the developers worked very hard on this game, but it's also clear they don't understand how to make games fun; if you worked on this game and are reading this please take note. Before you release anything, please get people who are outside your circle (or at least not friends) to playtest it, I know it hurts like seeing your kid torn to shreds but it will give you good feedback. Oh, and please get Unity, at least the personal edition, at least to improve as game developers. And good luck on future projects. As for consumers considering buying this, consume elsewhere.\n\nEdit: sorry if I come off as cynical in this review, in truth I just feel like this game could have been so much more, and that's why I bothered to put three hours into writing some (hopefully) constructive criticism.","July 11, 2015","false","2.2"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

By reccomending this game, however, I'm suggesting that you try out the demo first, as it is indicative of the game overall and contains probably around 30 to 40% of it, maybe more.\n\nI would also recommend turning off auto-jump. Many a time in my playthrough has the auto-jump mechanic turned me into a curse spewing manchild that would make a sailor blush. I also played with mouse and keyboard if that's a heads up on anything.\n\nAnyways, this game, to me, tries to tackle a simple question: What would result if you combined the upgrade/mechanic progression design from the Metroid series, take a few mechanics and the puzzle elements from the 3D Zelda games, and put it into a linear 3D platforming game? That result sounds like it could be pretty cool if it was executed well. From Soy Sauce, a team of three brothers plus a few others on the side, have a neat smorgasboard of Nintendo-inspired elements that falls a little flat in execution. The game, above all else, comes off as a love letter to the video games it was inspired from and you can see the team's love from the way they designed the game. However, there are times when the design could be better executed.\n\nI'm currently posting an almost full analysis of things it did well and things it didn't do as well for the devs since what I've typed wouldn't fit into the steam review text block, but I will say this:\n\nDo you want a small diversion from whatever game you're playing right now or just in general?\n\nDo you want to play a challenging game that can feel ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t at times but does not hold your hand and can have a mix of clever and "could be better" level design?\n\nDo you want to play as a cute anime grill with some well done mechanics and some "needs to be done better" mechanics?\n\nDo you like Metroid progression design, Zelda puzzles/hud/throwing pots, and Mario 64/Sunshine platforming stages?\n\nThen I recommend. It's by far not a bad game at all, and does some things pretty well. Just don't jump in expecting a story, AAA graphics, or atmospheric distractions: this is a mainly pure gameplay experience that doesn't hold your hand and assumes a lot out of the player, which can be both a good and bad thing at times in this game. Overall, for 3 or 4 hours of content at $5 it's a nice diversion.\n","August 9, 2015","true","2.4"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/GameDevYal/recommended/382570/","GameDevYal","Yal","http://steamcommunity.com/id/GameDevYal/","113 products in account","Glass Wing is a Banjo-style puzzle platformer with fantastic, N64-style ambience! It has varied areas and biomes just within the first 30 minutes of gameplay and it feels like new areas just keep coming, each one with stealth elements, tricky puzzles and that little pinch of something new every time.  It's polished like granite, and if Zelda was a horror series, Glass Wing would be part of it.\n\nOne of my favourite gameplay mechanics is the automatic jumping whenever you move over an edge - it means you can just lean back and concentrate on planning your moves instead of executing everything with pixel precision, making the gameplay more tactical and rewarding. Another cool thing is how items you can interact with stands out from the environment, making it really clear what you're supposed to do. In particular, the recovery hearts look really nice. And the way the title screen and file select menu is directly integrated in the game is really cool as well, giving you nothing that breaks immersion. The game also connects nicely to other works of the same dev and forms a coherent plot with callbacks and references to his previous games - if you know where to look.\n\nOn the flip side, though, it has several visual and aural glitches such as the Ferace dialogue looping if you cause the game to lag (might as well blame my WinXP PC for that, though :P) or Mayfly autojumping when going through certain doors which looks weird, but overall this doesn't taint my overall impressions of the game and I'm really recommending it!","October 3, 2015","true","1.0"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

That said - there is stuff that can *easily* kill you. The game is largely casual and laid back but some of the puzzles may have you pulling your hair out if you can't time jumps like a pro.\n\nSpeaking of Jumps: The game has a bit of a blessing and a curse when it comes to them, yes there is manual jumping (ie pressing Space to Jump etc) but there is also tied into the root game a feature which can make you jump automatically as you near places where it might be viable; this is both good and bad - it's good because it hints at the fact you make a jump here - it's bad because the game often mis-times the jumps automatically and you end up having to compensate.\n\nNot spoiling too much - the fact is I haven't played it very long at this point but I'm enjoying it regardless.","October 9, 2015","true","4.0"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kaiphas/recommended/382570/","Kaiphas","Kaiphas","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kaiphas/","62 products in account","Hmm... how do I put this? Glass Wing was a rather interesting game. I found out about this game awhile back when I was watching a podcast with DrWolf001 and he mentioned playing the voice of the antagonist Ferace. Was debating whether or not to get it, and decided to get it in the end.\n\nBefore I get into the review, I strongly recommend to play this with a controller. I used a Dualshock 3 controller to play this and it worked perfectly.\n\nLike I mentioned earlier, this game was rather interesting. You play the role of the Glass Wing Mayfly who is trying to get away from the demon Ferace, after he attempts to capture you. During the course of the game, you find various tools as well as unlock new abilities in order to progress through each map. The game is composed of several maps with puzzles as well as platforming stages.\n\nOne of the interesting concepts I found while playing is the use of tools and the "combat". The game strongly advises against fighting the monsters that roam around the game (The game description mentions Mayfly being very weak and not suited for combat) thus the tools you find around the game are instead used for exploring. Each tool has a purpose for getting around (this includes using a scythe to cut down plants, a sword for cutting thorns, a hammer for smashing certain blocks, etc.)\n\nThe music in this game was actually really nice to listen to. I actually recognized a few of them as several of the tracks used are from the artist Makkon, an artist who once did pony music (A Waltz for Trixie and Hallowed Waltz being the two used that I recognized).\n\nOne of the main gripes I had while playing this game was surprisingly not the controls, but the platforming levels (or Twilight Trials as they're called). I got through the first Twilight Trial perfectly fine, but aftwards they just got really painful to do. These levels were rather punishing if you fall off because you would have to start all the way back at the beginning. (This really isn't too horrible, but it gives me nostalgic moments of when I played games like Super Mario Sunshine and having to play those FLUDD-less platforming levels)\n\nAnother minor gripe I had involved the final segment of the game. There is a glitch that causes Mayfly to fall through the map should you die and try to reload the file. This was fixed by simply closing out of the game and reloading the save. Minor, but really annoying.\n\nOverall, I thought this game was a mixture of interesting and frustration. I enjoyed the interactions with Mayfly and Ferace and I rather enjoyed solving the puzzles (I'm still surprised I managed to beat this without consulting a guide... actually I couldn't find a guide for this game. Might write one up in the future if I feel like playing through again.) Would I recommend this game to anyone? Maybe... Maybe not... Depends on one's patience threshold as this game rather tested mine at some points, but it was rather satisfying when I managed to get past said points.\n\nRating: 7/10","February 21","true","8.7"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/yawaru/recommended/382570/","yawaru","Yawaru","http://steamcommunity.com/id/yawaru/","2511 products in account","I wanted to like this game. There are parts of the game that I think "wow, this might be fun." But the game is simply unpolished, unfinished, and barely playable. When you start the game you can choose between an external config or to launch the game. While re-bindable keys are appreciated, the menu themselves are barely functional, forcing you to assign vaguely named actions that you have to assign to a key to proceed. You have to assign buttons for panning the camera left and right when you can control the camera with the right analog stick, and triggers do not work despite asking for a 360 controller by name. Xbox One controllers do not work, and when I tried to play with one it glitched the game. I can't say how the game controls with keyboard but I don't imagine it worked too well. You can supposedly change mouse sensitivity, but I couldn't tell the difference between settings. The camera moves way too fast and jerky, which is detrimental to a platformer.\n\nSo, once you start the game you'll be greeted by a splash screen that looks like it was made on the old Geocities web page builder (in a word, sloppy). It will run at 60 FPS though, so kudos for that. Then you're dropped into the game, with max health and standing in front of a house with a magic door that drops you back outside the house when you try to go in. This is actually an interactive tutorial/game start scene, which is actually kind of cool. This is probably the most creative and interesting the game gets unfortunately, as the entire story is told in one poorly-animated exposition dump right after you start a new game.\n\nThen you go through a series of small arenas finding a particular tool to access the next level. This is the meat of the game: jumping around, avoiding enemies, and finding the tool you need to get to the next area. There are 8 tools (scythe, sword, axe, hammer, spear, shovel, tuning fork, torch) and 5 power-ups (some kind of spin, high jump, a ball form, ball bombs, and a short flight ability). I will admit, this gives the game a bit of variety, as each tool has a specific use which is tutorialized in the level you get it. There are a few levels where you use multiple tools to complete a level, but the levels are all short.\n\nIn terms of graphics, this is roughly the level of an Nintendo 64 game. Very basic textures, uninspired level design, and nonsensical floating platform levels. Movement is fairly fluid, and the spin move is somewhat satisfying, though the fact that you can't kill enemies makes it pretty moot. The controls make precision platforming  difficult, frustrating even, but I powered through almost the entire game.  The end is where the game really falls apart.\n\nThe second to last level is a mess, a poorly constructed combination of existing game assets used in nonsensical ways. For example, there are several signs from the start menu used as a platform. Aside from looking bad, they still have the text pop-up from the beginning of the game. This is beyond sloppy, it's a blatant lack of design and care. Most of the game ran reasonably well, then the final level has a game-breaking glitch as soon as the level starts. There's a pop-up that says "This glitch only occurs here, just restart and everything should be fine." And yes, I could restart after killing the game in Task Manager, then fall into the same glitch when I load the last checkpoint.\n\nWhile the game is far from the worst game ever, it's painfully unfinished, obviously rushed in places, and simply not that good. It's a shame, because the game could be interesting, the villian seems to want to use the main character's glass wings to save other demons who are turning into savage beasts and wants to do this to stop humans and demons from killing each other. Unfortunately he does this in the most evil way possible, ripping out the main character's wings and telling him/her/it that it will let the wings regrow and rip them out again. This game could be good with a year or two of development and a cohesive art aesthetic, but I doubt that will ever happen. As is, this game just isn't very good.","April 23","false","4.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","33"
