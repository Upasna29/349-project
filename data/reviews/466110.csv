I couldn't believe that for early access there is so much more accomplished here than in Kings of Kung Fu. The dev definitely improved his skill since then and it shows.\n\nThe visuals are absolutely beautiful. Some of the stages just blew me away with the detail that during the fights I found myself focusing more on the environment than the actual fight.\nAdding to the awesome experience, I was really impressed with the music and sound fx. It just adds that much more to the experience making it feel like you are taking part in a 1970's Kung Fu film.\n\nI'm in total shock that this is all done by one dev. I have to take my hat off to him. This is super impressive work.\n\nNow being an early access game I did expect to find some issues in the game. I noticed graphical glitches very rarely appearing throughout the game (sometimes at random or sometimes when changing the graphics settings), I also noticed character clipping when they were too close to each other, and an imbalanced AI fighting system. There were a few other bugs but nothing serious.\n\nClosing this up, all I can say is this game is definitely worth the $$$ and is an experience you should not miss. The dev put a lot of heart into it and as an early access game it's great to be a part of it to watch it get better with the patches and updates.\n\nThis is definitely a game I will be playing quite often. You should give it a try too. :)\n","May 10","true","3.5"," 21 of 23 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","21","23","0","3"

Tightening up block would make the game more enjoyable and less frustrating in my opinion.\n\nOverall, I'm satisified and I look forward to replaying the game in the future after a couple patches. If you're a fan of classic kung fu films, Bruce Lee, Jackie Chan... etc then this is pretty much a must buy.","May 9","true","3.2"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","12","14","0","1"

Where the other game fell short in execution and delivery, this game has largely fixed and it now actually feels like there is a solid engine and framework in place. While its DEFINITELY NOT a game catering to the hardcore FGC crowd, the important tropes that must exist do exist (such as deep jump ins, crossups, pokes, footsies, etc).\n\n'Execution requirements' is not even a thought. The game was never intended to be something you need a bible and 3 years of college to become good at a single character... Its a game where you can pick up and have fun pulling off cool moves. A basic overarching yet simple moveset links everything together and allows you to recreate moments from the old classic kung fu movies which the game takes its inspirations from with very little difficulty. However 'simple' does not mean 'baselessly shallow' like the previous game. This game does have enough depth to it to reward those who absolutely insist on getting the last 20% out of a character, as opposed to simply playing to 80%. Its simple, and yet rewarding.\n\nThe game still has a number of kinks and flaws of course but it IS Early Access. Give it a chance to develop as it is a labor of love by a single guy.","May 10","true","1.0"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","8","10","0","0"

This is just like playing the old kungfu movies. Very authentic. This type of game is needed in an industry full of saturated karate games. Hope this will start a new era of defining and revamping fighting games. Keep up the good work.

Everything from the music, backgrounds and techniques of the fighters are presented with passion and care. This game is a love letter to those movies from which it is inspired from. There is a rhythm and speed to the game that you will need to get used to but once you do you will truly feel like a martial arts master.","May 9","true","0.1"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","8","11","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/chon9/recommended/466110/","chon9","Chon9","http://steamcommunity.com/id/chon9/","321 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nPros\n- the Chinese martial art moves are motion captured by developer himself, which made the game very unique. (WELL DONE)\n- Great graphic art style and music that matched the theme of the kungfu world.\n- Real Kungfu, not those imagined moves.\n\nCons\n- Still not yet polished, control and movement input abit delayed, but can be accepted since it still early access.\n- No story mode yet, only arcade mode available,hopefully will be great story mode available soon.\n- No Multiplayer yet (Not a big deal since nowadays most multiplayer game on Steam dead after few weeks)\n\nPersonal comments and wishes for this game:\n- Dislike the half circle style of control like other fighting game, which I hope it will be like more toward button combo to execute the move.\n- Sometimes, Chinese martial art is about reversal, so add in reversal move will be an advance to this game to me.\n- Also, if it can when 2 people hit at sametime, will auto block and disengaged.\n- Split the weapon and hand to hand combat, or at least only allow weapon after grab up. (A real kong fu master can use several type of weapons, and most of the time weapon will only fight with weapon)\n\nJust start playing, if I had missed up something please forgive me. Btw, I will continue support this developer for his efforts and looking forward to this game updates.","May 16","true","2.6"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","1"

There are a few things to be improved, which I hope gets addressed on the full version. Buying the game on its current stage at 25% discount is definitely a good decision that I made as the developer listens to the player's opinions (and not all of them will be implemented, of course).\n\nDefinitely an excellent and nostalgic experience for those watched all the kung fu movies from Jackie Chan, Jet Lee and Bruce Lee.","May 10","true","4.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/KRGraphics/recommended/466110/","KRGraphics","KRGraphics","http://steamcommunity.com/id/KRGraphics/","20 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nAfter watching the trailers of this game and the beta footage, I was immediately psyched when I found out another version of this game was being made. I'm a huge fan of the old Chinese martial arts films and so naturally, I want to try this game out and after a while of playing, I was very impressed with the level of authenticity with the character models and the levels in the game. I truly hope the developer will keep adding to this one...\n\nThe graphics for this game really grabbed me, especially the feel of the old movies that I grew up watching... just turn on the movie effect and you are pretty close to watching the movie, especially on stages like Waterfall. I almost just want to stand there an admire the details. If you are on a stronger machine, you can turn on everything and truly experience the game.\n\nThe character models all feel familiar. I instantly recognised the influences for the character, especially The Dragon and White Brow, with his signature smug pose. I almost wanted him to laugh at me as he was whupping my ♥♥♥, just like the movies. The animation at times feels very fluid during the fight and each strike and kick feels and sounds just like the movies, but I wish there were more moves for these guys and a movelist for each character. I had to figure out the moves at first but after a round, I caught on quickly. On the other hand, there is a little stiffness with some of the movements but I am sure after an update, it will be fixed.\n\nIn closing of this review, the developer has put a lot of love and energy into creating a game that feels like the genuine article. And as a fan of martial arts, I deeply appreciate the love and care that has been taken to create interesting characters and picturesque environment (Btw, the market stage is pretty cool too. The dog doesn't even know the fight is going on, lol), and it just grabs you. If you have played the previous entry, Kings of Kung Fu, you will definitely love this one... #TeamWutang","May 11","true","2.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"
