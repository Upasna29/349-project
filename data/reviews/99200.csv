Yes, you can play by yourself, but this is absolutely a party game, like the You Don't Know Jack of the 90's. So why, oh why, can you only play 2 players? Supposedly, it's because only 2 people can feasably use the keyboard at the same time. I guess Jellyvision didn't know you can use game pads on your PC. Sheesh.\n\nAll gripes aside, the game is hilarious. Sometimes, answering the question right is a matter of deciphering the strange wording of the questions, which can be funny or frustrating, depending on how clever you are. Be ready for anything, this is not a standardized test.\n\nIt sure seems as if this will be the last 'traditional game' iteration of You Don't Know Jack. Now with mobile games, you can play against a bunch of people you don't know on Facebook, instead of in the same room with your good friends shouting and acting silly. Huge improvement, social media sure is making our lives better! /sarcasm\n\nWell, that's the way the Cookie crumbles!\n\n7.0/10\nTrivia for those who don't care if they lose, when a good fart joke is so much more enjoyable.","February 26, 2015","true","36.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Unfortunately, it disappoints on a few key fronts and I can't wholeheartedly recommend it:\n\n1) 2-player only. Many older YDKJ version offer more players, and console versions of this remake offer 4-player. This is a game where more players = more fun, so the lack of 4-play is disappointing.\n2) No net play. While Jack is best face to face, and none of the older Jacks had this either, if I recall... it should be a standard feature on a modern remake like this.\n3) No controller support. This is probably the reason for the 2-player limitation. Both players have to huddle around the keyboard, which is a bit lame. I'd like to hook a laptop up to the TV and give each player an xbox360 controller to buzz in with... but no dice. This is another feature available on consoles, by the way.\n\nIn summary, this is tha YDKJ you know and love from 1996... which is 2014 is a bit disappointing. The PC version is also surpassed in features by the console version.","January 1, 2014","false","0.6"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","60","3","5","2","0"

Don't get me wrong, it's fun, I'd reccomend buying it and playing it if you like trivia games with a twist, but just..something about it feels lacking. Maybe it's just the nostalgia.\n\nEither way, this is a fun game for you and a friend to play. The commentary has that same near dry flavor that YDKJ does so well, and the inclusion of the Wrong Answer of the Game almost adds a complete new spin on how you play the game.

Cookie Masterson and the JellyVision team return.\n\nIs it a reboot?  Sorta yeah.  Is it a remake?  Nah, not really.  Is it the same as it ever was?  Yes and no.\n\nThe questions are all new, as is the dialogue and there is a slight change in the key assignments, but Cookie, the interface, Jack Attacks, DisOrDats and screwing should be familiar to any YDKJ veteran.  What is VASTLY improved are the production values.  Not only had YDKJ gone all high-def (‘n stuff), but there's full-screen support for this bad boy (woohoo!).  The addition of the "Wrong Answer of the Game" prizes, Nocturnal Admissions and Who’s the Dummy shake it up a little bit, in a good way.  I am, however, on the fence about the achievements (Getting "mouth breather" is not exactly something I'm proud of).\n\nWhile I don't exactly miss the "Gibberish Question" portions, I do miss 3-player support (yeah, it was actually a thing on the older games).  Rumor has it, some other versions of this have 3-player support (Don't hold me to that, as I am speaking for the PC/Steam version.  Mostly, though, I REALLY miss the 7 or 15 question selection some of the older YDKJ games had.\n\nDo any of my negatives turn me off to it?  No, absolutely not.  The new YDKJ is like having your best friend over to your house after losing touch for 10 years.  He/she has certainly changed, but they're (likely) still the same person and you can still relate.  In the case of YDKJ, they're the same person, funny and relevant as ever, polished and shiny, and damnit, they look better than I do for having 10+ years go by since I last saw 'em!\n","December 31, 2013","true","36.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The addition of the Wrong Answer aspect will keep you on your toes.  They still retain Dis or Dat and the every joyful Jack Attack.\n\nThe PC version, oddly enough, is inferior in its multiplayer control schemes.  Whereas the Xbox 360 version allows four, each on their own controller, the PC version only has a two player option and the control scheme is a bit...rough.\n\nStill, if you are a champion of the Social Outcast achievement, such as myself, the single player still has that YDKJ feel with an updated temperament.","December 21, 2013","true","7.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This modern rendition shouldn't disappoint.\n\nIt's definately best played vs someone sitting right next to you, although single player is still plenty of fun.\n\nThe humors pretty good, and there's sure to be laughs in there for just about anyone.\n\n\nReally the only complaint I have is that the Steam version just seems to tagging along in terms of support as they were obviously targeting other markets with this release.  i.e. - No Steamcloud support, no online multiplayer, no control customization.\n\nI recall the old YDKJ's supporting 1-4 players, but this one only supports 2 players.\n\nApart from that, I still highly recommend this game.","May 3, 2013","true","31.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I guess spending my whole life playing video games has taught me absolutely nothing about the world around me. Chalk it up to ignoring all news and pop culture. Anyone I have over and play this with is sure to stomp my ♥♥♥. I still enjoy it though. I see why this series has been around so long. It's about as good as trivia can get in video game form. Very entertaining. PC needs more party games like this. Get drunk with a friend and have fun.\n\nBe warned though. There is no online multiplayer. There is no 3 or 4 player. There is no controller support either. You will need to use joy2key or something else to use controllers. Also, it doesn't seem to respond to inputs in Big Picture Mode. If you can, go for the console version. Else, get this on the cheap like I did.\n\nAlso, play the facebook game. It's basically the exact same presentation. It's the only thing I made a facebook account for.","January 20, 2013","true","17.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The only problem is that the concept is too much for some people. For example, I was playing with my cousin and he got all pissy when the question was confusing to figure out. So, i say to him that's the point of the game to figure out the question, then answer. After this, I tell him what the question is asking and he still doesn't get it right and just quits. So, make sure friends are not idiots.","August 1, 2015","true","46.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If it does, make a short-cut to it on your desktop, go into the properties of the short-cut, select the "Compatibility" tab, check the box labeled "Disable display scaling on high DPI settings", and then click OK. If this was your problem, the game will run fine when you use the short-cut and scale itself automatically (I think THQ implemented it with vectorized graphics and text anyway). It would be nice if Steam could do this for folks with older games in which it's necessary, although this may be one of the few.","May 3","true","8.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
