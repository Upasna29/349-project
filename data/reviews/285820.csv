In Action Henk you play as Henk, obviously, an out of shape 90s action hero trying to defeat his nemesis Kentony! Run, jump, slide and wall jump your way to victory with one of the five playable characters. Action Henk's gameplay is sort of like Speedrunners meets the Trials series, I'd describe it as Trials without the bikes.\n\n+Nice graphics\n+Hilariously imagined characters\n+Fun gameplay, it really has the "one more try for gold" feel to it\n+Some great references throughout ranging from Thunderbirds, to MIB to the Sanic meme\n+Over 70 tracks (not to mention all of the community made ones)\n+Five playable characters, each with different skins to unlock\n+Great soundtrack\n+Lots of replayability, especially if you want to have a gold medal for each map\n+A good level editor\n+A fun hookshot mechanic which is introduced later in the game\n+Difficulty increases at a good rate\n+Great controls (I played with KB&M)\n+After completing a level you can challenge your friends to try and beat your time\n+Friendly devs\n\n-At some parts in later levels it can be difficult to know what you're supposed to do unless you watch how the ghost does it first\n\nVerdict:\n9\n\nAction Henk is an absolutely fantastic racing platformer with nice graphics, great characters, addictive gameplay and loads of levels to play. If you're a fan of Speedrunners or trials this is an absolute must buy!\n\n***This review was written using a key provided by the Developers for review purposes***\n\nEl K.","May 15, 2015","true","3.3"," 63 of 73 people (86%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","86","63","73","4","0"

After rainbowing all of the original levels I fell away from it for a few months. Then with the introduction of the new levels and multiplayer I have not been able to stop playing this game! I'm now in the top ten and have a WR on a level and have no intentions of stopping as there is so much I can do and play.\nThe multiplayer is perfectly done, you can chat, throw in a taunt and see what others are doing. If you were good enough then you can gloat from the podium. I haven't even mentioned the level editor that allows you to make your own levels that are downright devious or just flat out fun!\nThe level designs are fun, yet challenging. The earlier levels are easy to play hard to master, and the later levels are just plain challenging. It is vibrant with lots of colors great animations and environments, and tons of amazing eastereggs. The developers of this game obviously made it as a passion project. It is a hotwheels meets speedrunners and is just incredible. BUY THIS GAME! It is the next huge indie game IMO and these devs deserve every penny!","June 24, 2015","true","937.7"," 33 of 35 people (94%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","94","33","35","3","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/badBlackShark/recommended/285820/","badBlackShark","|lDgAl| badBlackShark","http://steamcommunity.com/id/badBlackShark/","104 products in account","This is honestly one of the most amazing games I have ever played.\n\nGAMEPLAY:\n\nIt's a perfect example of how the principle "easy to learn, hard to master" should be implemented into a game. It only has a very limited amount of controls, only run, jump, reset (to start or checkpoint) and, in some levels, hook. That means you don't have to remember much. Finishing the track at all isn't hard at all (excluding the very last set of levels). But getting a time good enough to beat the gold medal (for beginners) or the rainbow medal (for more advanced players) gets very hard very soon. And even IF you manage to beat all normal tracks with the rainbow medal, defeat all your opponents in challenges and collect all the coins of the bonus levels in time, that doesn't mean that the game doesn't offer anything anymore. There is still an online multiplayer to play with friends or meet new ones. You can build your own tracks or play some of other members of the community. You can try to further improve your time on tracks to reduce your combined time of all tracks to get a better rank on the global leaderboard, or to get a top 10 time on a track, or maybe even a world record. Once you master all the little mechanics that might be hard to pull off, but save you alot of momentum and time when done correctly, you can spend countless hours grinding levels to get a better time. And when you think you got everything done, then someone finds a new mechanic, a new route or a skip, and it starts all over again.\n\nCOMMUNITY:\n\nThe members of the community are all awesome people. Never have I found people that are more friendly than the Action Henk community in any game. Once you reach a certain level of play, and you get in touch with some of the higher ranked members, you get tips and tricks on how to get better times pretty much daily.\n\nOn top of that, the developers are extremly supportive in every possible way and really try to give everyone the best possible experience. I've never seen devs so nice anywhere (thanks for the awesome time at Gamescom while I'm at it <3)!\n\nWHAT IS BAD?\n\nSadly, multiplayer is pretty empty most of the time, but that's not the game's fault. Also, if you are not into grinding, doing stuff over and over again until it's perfect than the game doesn't offer much to you after a while.\n\nSHOULD I BUY IT?\n\nIf you are impatient, get upset easily and can't stand doing stuff over and over again, then it's questionable. Getting the rainbow medal everywhere is certainly not easy and will take quite a long time, so if you only want to go for completion, this game offers you probably between 30 and 60 hours of gameplay, depending on how good you are. If you like getting stuff as perfect as possible and if you are a competitive person, then this game offers you at least 200 hours of gameplay, but probably more, as more routes and strats are getting found weekly. For the little price of this game you get more gameplay than in alot of AAA titles that cost 4 times as much, so I would definatly say: Buy it!","October 5, 2015","true","839.2"," 30 of 31 people (97%) found this review helpful","97","30","31","0","0"

The story really isn't important, the game shines in its gameplay. Graphically the game is pretty 'eh' with its pretty low res textures, but the backgrounds are full of references and nice enough to where its not really a big deal that the characters, up close look pretty gross.\n\nThere are over 50 different racing tracks to challenge yourself on if your looking for gold or rainbow badges. The other 2 levels, bronze and silver, are super simple and if you have any exprience with this type of game you'll have no problem beating them. The game really shines when racing against ghosts of your friends or gold-level ghosts or higher.\n\nThe momentum in the game feels really solid so I don't really have any complaints there, except with the hook. It feels very weighty to me, so its harder to get used to. It works alright, its not horrible, but its definitely not on the level of something like speedrunners when it comes to its hook mechanics, but it does have strong momentum mechanics otherwise. The different boss levels are challenging and change things up a bit from the basic levels, as do the coin collection bonus levels you unlock after beating an areas boss. There is a lot to do in this game without even mentioning its steam workshop support with several different expert levels made by the community.\n\nOverall Action Henk is a great Runner with very well done momentum mechanics, Highly recommended. This game is super underrated In my opinion, its like it got overlooked by some of the other great titles released around its time. But if your into games like Trails or Bit Trip Runner, you need to give Action Henk a shot.\n\nWait For A Sale","July 2, 2015","true","11.5"," 22 of 25 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","22","25","2","1"

You play as Action Henk, a 90’s action figure who has let himself go a little bit over the years. It is your job to race against other action figures to prove that you are the best toy – I mean action figure\n\nThe first thing that pulled me into playing Action Henk is that it had a similar gameplay style to Sonic and SpeedRunners, both games that I love. Action Henk does not disappoint in this aspect, if you like Sonic and/or Speedrunners, get Action Henk right now!  In Action Hank the aim of the game is to gain as much momentum as you can to get through the track in as best of a time as you can (although you do need to beat certain times to get a bronze, silver or gold medal) You run, jump and skid through the Hot Wheels esque track to reach the finish line. In later levels you are given a grappling hook style power-up which you use to swing through some of the track. The grappling hook is the old extra power-up you can get in this game, it is a very fun tool to use, but the game feels like many other power ups could have been included to change up how you play.\n\nThere are 9 different themed zones, each with 5 levels and an extra boss level. Each theme looks vastly different from each other and it is a lovely change of environment when you have just spent the past 100 deaths on the previous level. Each theme also has it’s own music, so you will not grow tired of the same song throughout the entirety of the game. The finishing boss battles are a race against another action figure, in this mode you do not try and beat a set time for a medal, you just need to beat the opponent (but your scores are recorded on a leaderboard, so getting a great time is always a good thing to strive for)\n\nAction Henk has ghosts. Not the haunting, poltergeist kind, the helpful kind that gives you something to race against. You;ve seen them before, they are a semi-transparent character that run through the track to give you someone to race. The great thing about these ghosts is that they are customisable- you can race against the par time for bronze, silver or gold medal, so you know that if you beat the ghost, you earned the medal for whichever ghost you were racing. You can also race against your friends ghost (their best time) or your best time. You can even switch off ghosts completely. You also have the option to view the leaderboards for the world and watch an action replay of other people, however, you cannot seem to be able to race against their ghosts – which although I will never be able to beat them, it would have been a nice addition.\n\nI found the progression of each level to be a little strange. The game starts off quite easy and remains quite easy up until the end, and then suddenly it seems to introduce new mechanics that I didn’t know how to do. Luckily I was able to watch someone else’s replay on the leaderboards to find out how to do it.  (on the last theme there was this triple jump back-flip thing you have to do, which took me forever) I would have preferred a more stacked progression i.e. starting off easy, getting a bit hard, bit harder, hard, very hard.\n\nOnce you complete all the levels, which shouldn’t take you long (unless you go for gold on each level) then you may be bored playing this game. Actually, you won’t at all – this game has Workshop support with a built in map maker! At the time of writing this review, there are currently 207 custom user-made maps which will keep you entertained for a VERY long time. You can even try and make your own track!\n\nAction Henk also includes a multiplayer feature, although I could never find another player to have a game with. There was 1 lobby open, but the person seemed to be away from their computer, so I easily beat them and got the achievement. It could have just been an off day, but at the time of writing there is currently 1 lobby open with 1 person  -so maybe an off week? However, if you get a group of friends to play this with, it will be a blast, great party game!\n\nCurrently on Steam for £10.99, it is a little pricey when shown next to a similar game, Speedrunners (currently £6.99) but I still think the game is worth that price. Action Henk has wonderful graphics and the environmental scenery looks great. The music is catchy and since it changes style on each zone, you will not grow tired of it. It is a very fast paced, fun game and I’m sure that if you get it, you will have a blast. You can even grab a slightly discounted double pack to play with a friend! (or they can buy it themselves, the cheap b****rds)\n\n\n\nFull Disclosure: We were given a copy of the game to be able to complete our review. This did not have an impact on our views of the game, nor did it have an impact on the review itself.\n\n\nFor more reviews, visit https://www.ordinarygamer.co.uk","May 26, 2015","true","4.3"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","7","8","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bahderb/recommended/285820/","bahderb","Bah","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bahderb/","2492 products in account","Action Henk is a fun casual game that should appeal to gamers of all ages. The premise is simple. The game is a series of "race" tracks where you're racing against the clock or against other people in the multiplayer modes. If you've ever played a game from the Joe Danger series or to a lesser extent in terms of comparison, the Trials series, you'll have an idea of what Action Henk is all about. Another game I found it easy to compare is the Bit Trip Runner series. Basically every course is based on simple physics, speed and momentum. Your goal is to finish the track in the fastest time. There is a good deal of variety throughout the courses, with your buttslide and grappling hook coming into play at various times. You'll have to learn to time your jumps and nuances of particular courses to get the fastest time.\n\nPros:\n+ Very fun graphically. This game doesnt take itself seriously.\n+ Variety of tracks.\n+ Friends leaderboard.\n+ Steam Workshop support. Create your own tracks!\n+ Wide range of courses that unlock after a certain amount of medals in the section prior.\n+ "Ghosts" and replays to see where you messed up or how to tackle a tough obstacle.\n\nCons:\n- The music is abysmal.\n\nAll in all, Action Henk is a good entry into this genre of game. It encourages competition, but at the same time keeps it light and fun. The track creator is fairly robust and hopefully Workshop support will encourage people to make new and even better tracks.\n\nI recommend Action Henk if you are looking for a fun game with a competitive spirit.","June 17, 2015","true","5.6"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","0"

The game doesn't have the most mechanics, mostly consisting of the track its self, sliding and occasionally a hook shot, It starts off relatively simple and it gets much, MUCH harder as you go through the game, all while listening to a fantastic heart pumping soundtrack.\nThere are 10 zones in the game with 9 different themes, starting off with the easy going early worlds, and ending with face paced levels that will test you, and you will fail, many times.\n\nAs you go you will unlock more characters to play as (6 in total), you unlock them by doing their challenge at the end of each world, the later ones are instead different costumes for the characters which you can unlock and use yourself. Getting all golds in a world will also grant access to a bonus level of which you must pass by finding the most efficient way of going around the track while collecting gold medals to unlock more skins for each character. Some skins are also unlocked through achievements.\n\nDespite all that there are some flaws.\n-No re-bindable controls (at time of writing)\n-Tricks that are nearly necessary in the later worlds are often taught though random loading screen tips (using the ghosts as a example can be hard to follow let alone watch without these tricks)\n-The physics can feel a bit floaty at times, especially on the grappling hook\n-Crashes a fair amount during multiplayer (atleast on my side)\n\nDespite all this, the game is fantastic and is great fun to play and is constantly challenging you throughout the many worlds and I'd highly recommend it if you're into this type of game.","May 16, 2015","true","38.8"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","2"

You always need JUST ONE more try - then you miss a jump only by milliseconds, and imediately hit the retry button! I ended up spending well above an hour on one level alone. This would normally drive me mad, but since each level is relatively short/fast, you don't get the same level of agony as the Classic platformers where a restart would easily cost you 10 minutes.\n\nThe sense of speed is great, the physics and game mechanics is really amazing, and I particularly like the way the sucktion cup Works and feels. After more than 3 hours of playing, I still have levels to complete, and there's even more levels to come soon. So I'd definitely recommend this game to anyone that likes a fast paced game, that also requires learning and skills, and offers a hilarious and surreal twist to childhood memories as you race through the levels.

Action Henk!\n\nNot only are the controls smooth and intuitive but the momentum is palpable. This fatman moves as well as you would expect from gameplay videos, he handles like a dream.\n\nDon't expect many levels or challenges yet, though; the game is in a really early stage and the content is scarce. And though I hope for more interesting elements in the tracks, it seems much is to be done.\n\nThe two problems I have with this game lay within the setting, which I find a bit confusing (how does a toy get overweight? who is making all these tracks? is the toy alive? maybe it doesn't matter), and the art direction. The character designs so far are terrible. And I wouldn't complain about them if I didn't know better, they could be having so much more fun with toy designs! Action Henk himself is not half bad but Betsy, oh god, she's an abomination from Hell. The environment is ok but, like I said before, I hope they start including better elements related to toys and more interactive tracks.\n\nOverall, I'm glad I bought it, it's fun, it's energetic.

I'm excited to sink my teeth into the promised level editor and make the fun crazy Hot Wheels tracks I never got to make as a child. My recommendation? Buy it now, support development, and enjoy what's currently available. I love RageSquid too.","July 18, 2014","true","1.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's a very similar game in that the core mechanics are pretty damned easy. You have a jump and a slide button and can move in a direction, aside from that there's nothing else to do, so picking the game up is quick.\n\nLike Trials the area that the game gets really fun and interesting is that you're racing against the clock trying to get Gold/Rainbow medals for each track, you're also racing agains the leaderboard because who doesn't to be at the top of a leaderboard.\n\nThankfully because the controls are so simple the team behind Action Henk have really nailed the controls. Input feels like it's instant and I've never been annoyed at not getting a gold medal because my input hasn't been handled correctly, instead I know it's because I screwed up a certain section of the track.\n\nI also have to say the level design so far has been really, really good and they've nailed the whole theme of toys running on a matchbox tracks setup in crazy designs.","August 8, 2014","true","2.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's definitely still being actively developed, but the core structure is all there and it's all great. The momentum system is very reminiscent of the 2D Sonic games, but the emphasis here is less on precision platforming and more on maintaining that momentum through the fast-paced levels.\n\nYou have a jump button and a slide button that makes you gain speed on slopes or other downward surfaces. It seems simple, but it gives way for a lot of little complexities; you can jump onto slopes to sacrifice speed early on but gain more in the long run, jump-boost off of slopes to gain a brief burst of speed in exchange for your momentum, etc. Though pro players have already optimized most of the easier levels, there's still room for creativity to get the best possible times.\n\nThere's a few level-specific mechanics, like a grappling hook that functions similarly to the one in SpeedRunners. But for the most part, it's very focused on mastering the main mechanics, which I think is a good way to go. The game feel is sharpened to a razor sheen and it shows. The inclusion of ghosts to race against and an instant level reset button are fantastic features to foster a speedrunning community.\n\nThe style might be a little divisive, but I think it's pretty rad. 80s/90s-era action figures racing on tracks made from your usual construction materials; wood blocks, Hot Wheels tracks, that sort of thing. The action figures themselves are, for lack of a better term, butt-ugly. Which is clearly what they're going for here, so I commend them on the unique choice of character style.\n\nAction Henk is pretty clearly tailored toward the speedrunning community, since you'll burn through most of the levels in an afternoon if you're not looking to get all the medals or compete for the best times. But I still think you'll have a good time with it either way, if you love platformers with a big focus on speed like I do.","January 5, 2015","true","10.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The controls are tight for the most part and are very responsive. Not only that but I absolutely love the gameplay environments, I love the idea of controlling action figures in what is essentially a child's dream room, full of stock car tracks and loops and all sort of other nostalgic play toys.\n\nIf there was one thing though that sort of bugged me, it was a good number of precision placement jumps necessary for completing the later levels, which I personally felt hindered the enjoyment a little. But despite that the game overall has tons of creativity, the numerous playable characters adds for a lot of variety, and the custom levels adds for even more enjoyment and extra content.","June 26, 2015","true","85.8"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

There's a heavy focus on flow and momentum, very curvy level designs that let you build up a lot of speed, and multiple paths you can access for performing better. The bronze/silver/gold/rainbow medal challengs are also a nice touch, catering to different skill levels. Personally I am a gold medal and never rainbow medal type of player, though rainbow medal is basically near-perfection that I can't be bothered with. The game also looks great, the aesthetic is superb and seeing all the pieces of level you ran over in the curvng backgrounds is really neat.\n\nI just can't really stand the game in its last levels, though... takes out all the flow and replaces it with awkward precise jumps that you can't differentiate from in the slightest unless you want to die. And die you will, it replaces any sense of skill with mindless trial and error that gets painful pretty quick. The last bonus level, also... whoever designed that should be fired. The world 10 race should prooobably be a bit more lenient, as well, and The Way of the Ninja is one of the worst-designed levels I've ever seen, but, ehh, I digress. On the whole the game is fine.\n\nOne other thing that continues to bother me though is the springs. I guess they're supposed to incorporate some degree of momentum-based bouncing, too? But I only ever found them horribly inconsistent and annoying. Minor gripe though.\n\nCan't really say I love the game, especially with the last world, but on the whole I like it. I'm not sure it's worth $15 though, unless you really like replaying levels, a lot.","May 27","true","9.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

No, not really, but still, for the asking price there isn't a lot of content or polish. A few different settings, which are ultimately the same. A new gimmick here and there (for example a swing mechanic that is only ever used in 1 setting, instead of combined in other levels). The rest is all passive...jump and slide, that's pretty much it, and hit objects at exactly the right angle and time for maximum effect. The game lacks a tutorial. New elements (apart from the grapple) are introduced without telling you how to tackle them. For example, did you know that loopings are best done sliding? You will eventually get a pre-game tip that tells you this, which is unacceptable. At least a "how to play" section needs to be part of the game. Other than that it's just another run of the mill runner. Joe Danger 2 is better for example if you're looking for that kind of thing. However, this also includes a level editor and online rankings, so at least you can get lots of play time out of it if you're not bored to death. I'm 2 hours in and almost done with the game. I COULD get all the gold medals to unlock more characters and get the best times, but just not what I'm primarily looking for in a game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nickcool9999/recommended/285820/","nickcool9999","bad","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nickcool9999/","30 products in account","Action Henk is a video game where you jump, slide, combine the two then slide and jump to get more speed on your next run. I very much like the concept of this game and it has phenomenal graphics. If you are in a position where 17 dollars is not very much to you (or however much it is in your country), then by all means this is a great buy.\n\nHowever... this review is very borderline positive as I was rethinking my opinions on this game. I love all of its content, but the combination of it in a game like this makes it seem less than it is after you've played it enough. Let me explain.\n\nJumping, Sliding, Hooking, Landing Properly. That's all this game consists of. Because of this, getting a world record time in this game is next to impossible, because all you do is literally practice this combination. In a game like trials, mechanics are its #1 priority before graphics and sound design. In this game, however, its architectural design and all of the major appealing features seem to be the key. In terms of feature diversity, it takes but 10 minutes for you to gain and lose a world record. I would like to emphasize, however that this paragraph is not intended to be directed towards cheating players, as that is an entirely different topic. This game is deceptively difficult.\n\nOh yeah. Multiplayer works, but nobody ever really goes on it... so there's that.\n\nBut where I stand about its flaws, I think anybody can agree that not only is the sound design near flawless... So is the graphics, mechanics design and momentum rules. That alone merits a +1 from me. It's very easy to tell that years of work went into a game like this and the level editor makes it a lot more enjoyable to a first time player. If you are the type of person who is just looking through steam to see which games are worth buying, please don't let my negative views on some of the content discourage you from buying it. If you aren't competing for world records or looking for some interesting game content to impress you, it's worth every penny.\n\nWould I recommend it to my friends? Not at its current state. The ending of the game is not beginner friendly and it gets needlessly complicated near the last levels. If the authors of this game could pad the game a lot more between these levels, I would consider recommending it. The game makes an absurd difficulty spike at the end. If you don't have the patience for it, the spike is worse than trials'.\n\nJust thought I would voice my opinion about it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/JesusOnWheels/recommended/285820/","JesusOnWheels","Jesus On Wheels","http://steamcommunity.com/id/JesusOnWheels/","349 products in account","A fairly solid game for what it is. I had been reminising about Unirally/Uniracers for SNES and Action Henk definately the recreated similar gameplay.  Unfortunately they went down the route of needing to retry the course every time you make a mistake if you want to get a half decent time meaning much of the harder levels depend largely upon memorisation. While I enjoy the gameplay it has only taken me an hour to get up to the third to last world on silver times, at which point memorisation seems to be more necessary rather then mostly reflexes.  I have better things to do then memorise every level. Some people may enjoy it but most people do not, as evidenced by the achievement levels for this part of the game onwards.\n\nImagine if you were playing mario kart without the randomness of other players, but every time you didn't make a corner perfectly you had to start the whole race again. Then make every corner extremely unpredictable and unforeseeable without knowing the map. Would mario kart still be as popular as it is?\n\nPerhaps an approach where multiple laps are needed would be better, so you can make some mistakes without needing to reset. As mentioned at the start Unirally/racers had 3 laps, and you could more tricks throughout to speed up when you fall behind.\n\nThe controls are tight and responsive, although the wall jumping isn't floaty enough. I like the humour and design of the world which is childish and nostalgic.  The shark and lava aspects of the game are great.  The characters while fun could have more varied and funny lines.\n\nIf you like perfectionist games like Trials give this a go. Otherwise maybe buy it on special and/or just get a refund when you get sick of it like me. I'd probably keep it if it had local coop multiplayer. The online appears to be dead.\n\nMaybe a local coop mode could be done where one player who falls behind can choose to teleport to the player in front and continue on where they are from, as they both try to get the best combined time?\n\nThe game 'Speedrunners' is far more fun, accessible, cheaper, has better physics (Action Henk basically copied the hookshot from Speedrunners) and has excellent local and online modes. Grab that instead, or try it out if you like Action Henk.","December 25, 2015","false","1.0"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

The tracks themselves are made from building blocks and toy car track, in Action Henk everything is "toy-scaled"!

My comments are my own.\n\nAction Henk is a game where you race not only against the time but also your friends and, if you want, the Number 1 time holder.  Mind you, racing against No. 1 is hard and requires a lot of finding those small frames that give you an extra second.\n\nYou can race against your friends two ways: by their recorded time or online via multiplayer.  Mind you, when I tried it the game crashed but this was when it loaded twice and I'm not sure whether to chalk that up against the game.\n\nMultiplayer is likely best played with friends or people that you can rely on being online at the same time.  The reason is that, like other indie games, there isn't a whole lot of people playing these games online(unless the statistics state otherwise.\n\nIf you are looking for something fresh in racing I'd recommend checking this out.\n\nHere's my video supplementing the review: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQXmt1-9ntU","May 15, 2015","true","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Levels start off easy enough to complete, and steadily become more challenging as you unlock more of them, with extra features and game mechanics introduced.\n\nThis is not a game for those who get frustrated easily: You will fail, and fail, and fail again as you try to speed up and optimise your path, leaping over "lava", sliding down hills, using the hookshot to try and build momentum, and figuring out where to best jump, to run, and slide to improve your run.\n\nThe amount of love that went into this game is obvious: The game has an awesome art style, with great details put into the backgrounds of the levels, and into the individual characters: Each of which has multiple outfits you can unlock - and these aren't just reskins - each outfit has been individually modelled, with a completely different theme and voice pack, and I'm fairly certain that many of them have their own character animations, with Swan Henk (a ballerina outfit for Henk, and one of the first you unlock) doing split jumps as you leap around the levels - I've not noticed others yet, but I've not had a chance to play with all of them.\n\nAnyone worried about the longevity of a speedrunning platform racer will be happy to know that there's a level editor available, which should allow for players to share their creations, and provide plenty of challenges even once you complete the main level pack. Multiplayer is also available, though I haven't had a chance to check it out yet.\n\nBasically a fantastic game, and you should definitely own this.","June 21, 2015","true","1.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mickyjayuk/recommended/285820/","mickyjayuk","Micky Jay","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mickyjayuk/","265 products in account","Toy story meets Sonic the Hedgehog in this high-octane 3D speed-running platformer dedicated to 90s nostalgia. From a basic prototype in 2013 to a highly praised Steam Early Access game, Action Henk has now finally been released upon the world in all his glory.\n\nThe protagonist of the story is the titular Henk, he’s an out-of-shape beer-bellied action figure who’s past his prime but trying hard to hold on to the glory of days gone by. Unfortunately, a nefarious doctor has stolen his “Toy of the Year” award and so Henk must return to action to reclaim his title.\n\nBefore I delve into the in’s and out’s of the game itself I first want to make one simple statement, this game is ridiculously fun. Built on the very simple control structure of running, jumping, butt-sliding, this game is impressively immersive, interesting and adrenalin-fuelled.\n\nThe main story campaign contains more than 70 tracks, all with varying degrees of difficulty and each with their own target times. The mode plays out in a very standard way for the genre, there are three target times per level, one for bronze, one for silver, one for gold, collect medals based on your performance and these medals and then used to unlock further levels are you progress through the campaign. All in all a bulk standard approach given the type of game. Where the game excels with this genre template though is in it’s overall design, it’s clear that the game has been thought out in advance and the limitations of progression are nailed. What I mean by this is, you don’t have to gold every race in order to progress,\n\nWhere the game excels with this genre template though is in it’s overall design, it’s clear that the game has been thought out in advance and the limitations of progression are nailed. What I mean by this is, you don’t have to gold every race in order to progress, Action Henk doesn’t intentionally try and hold you back, it’s new areas open up quickly and it’s fairly easy to progress through the entire campaign in hours not weeks.\n\nThis may not sound like the highest priority with the game design, but it does compliment Action Henk considerably given that the game’s primary focus is speed. This approach also removes the need to grind and instead leaves you wanting to return to levels for fun rather than necessity.\n\nOnce you’re done with the campaign, you don’t have to return to past levels to continue enjoying the game thanks to a level creator. Why not create your own work of insane art and share it with the world through the Steam workshop? If you’re feeling less than creative or you need a bit of inspiration then you also have the option to download track which the Steam community has created.\n\nMoving on to the gameplay itself, it’s exactly as you would expect, an interesting mix of fun and frustration. Action Henk is far from forgiving if you make even the slightest mistake and rookie players may find themselves spending hours on the first set of levels. This may be an issue for those with less than sharp reflexes, it can be incredibly painful, but master this game and you get a genuine sense of accomplishment out of it.\n\nThe level designs themselves are superb, if a little nauseating at times, the fact that this game can actually inflict motion sickness is both terrifying and impressive in equal measures. Unfortunately, this does mean that Action Henk can quickly become one of those game that you only play in small chunks. This isn’t a game to dedicate hours to in one go but one that having played short term increasingly calls you back for more once you’ve freshened up somewhat.\n\nThere is so much going on in each level and given the amount of levels on offer, two tracks rarely feel alike. That said many of the tracks are over in less than a minute and so gameplay comes thick and fast. As you progress though, you will begin to discover that a number of levels have multiple routes and so there is definitely a degree of replayability outside of simply wanting to beat your own score.\n\nEvery inch of every track has some toy reference associated, these levels are almost entirely constructed from toys. Making up the majority of the track action are the kind of orange ramps you’d expect to get with Hot Wheels sets, throw in the wooden train tracks and blocks kids use for tower construction and you’ve got a complete track filled with many obstacles, the attention to detail is impressive.\n\nFor those at the higher end of the gaming age bracket (if there is such a thing in this day and age), this game oozes nostalgia. The video game and pop culture references are abundant throughout, everything from Pokemon to Jaws gets a nod as well as a smorgasbord of the random childhood games we enjoyed in the 1990’s, there’s definitely a lot of love for the past in Action Henk, which I’m assuming also refers back to Henk’s heyday.\n\nThe characters really seal the deal with this game, they each have their own unique look, personality, issues and strengths. It’s very easy in a game of this nature to provide the user with throwaway characters, at the end of the day you don’t need an in-depth storyline and a cast of unique characters to make a speed-runner but Henk proves that when you do it adds a lot value and enjoyment to an otherwise standard setup.\n\nThe attention to detail, the nostalgia trip, the likeable characters, these all make up a brilliant package that is only fully realised by the stunning artwork this game has to offer. If you take a look at the video that developer RageSquid released on YouTube showing how the game has evolved over the last 18 months, you can see how much time and effort has gone into the look of the game.\n\nWhile the majority of the early game action takes places in the bedroom (hehe), it isn’t long before our overweight action figure is butt-sliding his way through a beach resort and later on swinging through a jungle environment. There is a great deal of differences between these environments yet each is beautifully rendered, colourful and full to the brim with life.\n\nIt’s actually extremely difficult to take in everything going on in the background due to the speed at which the game play moves but every so often it’s very easy for your line of sight to wander and you will get a glimpse of something brilliant, especially on the disco levels.\n\nComplementing the visuals is the soundtrack, it’s that perfect mixture of fun, happy, yet fast-paced music, the kind of that made Sonic such an enjoyable experience (enough with the hedgehog already). It’s very easy to zone out of what’s coming out of the speakers when playing a game of this nature but playing Action Henk, I never did, it helped motivate me.\n\nOverall, Action Henk is one of the best speed-runners that has been released in a number of years. The gameplay is fun, exciting and rewarding, the visuals are easy on the eye and impressive and the audio complements the whole package, but you need to be a fan of this genre to fully appreciate the game\n\nIt’s one downside is the balance between fun and frustration but with a little practice this game quickly turns in favor of enjoyment. This isn’t a game to play at length over many hours in one go but one to jump in and out of in small bursts for the most enjoyable results, especially if you suffer from motion sickness. If speed-runners are your thing then you will be hard-pressed not to find a reason to invest in this title.","June 1, 2015","true","1.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In the absence of any HYPE, 135 positive Steam reviews and 2 obligatory negative, played for 5 minutes / "joke" reviews pretty much sum up how good this game is. There are no half measures, everyone that played it doesn't like it, they LOVE it. The rest are too engaged in the game to write a review.\n\nI have a few games in my library which could be compared to it, Speedrunners would be one, Trials Fusion would be the other. Action Henk fills glaring gaps that exist in both these games. As well as having multiplayer it's enjoyable in singleplayer as a leaderboard game. The tracks are fun, the visuals are quirky and for something which looks so simple the game mechanics are completely unique with a devilish skills gap the reason why singleplayer and leaderboarding are so addictive.\n\nI can't recommend the game enough.","May 20, 2015","true","23.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a quick slog through the levels (2 hours and I got gold on everything up to Action Land), but once you get into Action Land it gets challenging (in a good way). You can always watch the top 10 replays to get an idea of how to do better, and you can eventually try to beat the top 10. If you like challenging your friends to beat your high scores, if you're a perfectionist, or if you just like cartoony games about speed (Gotta go fast :P), this is solid buy.","May 23, 2015","true","22.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Controls are very good and tight, speed feels wonderful, and there's nothing quite like seeing yourself improve in real time. The moment when I began accidentally overshooting a springboard that I couldn't even reach minutes before was immaculate.\n\nAlso the hookshot levels are the best part of the game because, buddy let me tell you, if you like figuring out speed tricks this game is ESPECIALLY for you, and the hookshot opens the game up to so many more possibilities for speed tricks.\n\ne: Just don't be offput by Betsy being terrifying.","December 21, 2015","true","8.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The action figures remind me of the classic film 'Toy Soldiers'\n\nThe game is in 2.5D perspective where you have to run against the clock and recieve medals, after a set amount of collected trophies, a new level unlocks and you do everything again! Just run, and run, and run!\n\nThe game is fun and very challenging however the game can get quite repetitive after 4 hours and the story is a hit and miss story. But overall, Action Henk is great indie game, get it now!\n\nRECOMMENDED :)","June 2","true","4.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
