For me, it is great fun.\n\nElse, look at the graphics and decide if you can bear them. They are very basic, but the gameplay is nice. I would guess about 20-30 interesting hours at least, less if you look at a walkthrough ;-)","July 20, 2015","true","0.1"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","11","13","0","0"

I owned the game in 1991 and downloaded it as Abandonware a bunch of years ago before Steam...it's no different. DRM is still there and it still runs though DOSBox.\n\nTIPS:\nGraphics select: 1 - VGA 265\nSound select: 4 - AdLib\nUse the manual to type in the DRM question otherwise the game will freeze\nAfter Alt-Tabbing out of DOSBox, goback to fullscreen mode by hitting Alt-Enter\nThe game is obviously dated, but if you stick with it, it really is a great game.  But I doubt modern gamers could actually get into this game..\n\nEDIT: just remembered a game breaking bug when I used to play it via DOSBox when this game was Abandonware and it's STILL here. At one point in the game you go to a Broodmaster World and hit 'P' to make contact and the screen goes black - but it still plays their music.\n\nNight Dive - do you have anyway to fix this? or are you only in the business of repackaging?","October 17, 2015","true","5.3"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","0"

It's replay is some what limited. but it takes awhile\nto get through the 4 systems.\n\n","May 16, 2015","true","4.6"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","7","10","0","0"

It's a good game.  One of the first space exploration games I had ever played.\n\nFor the time period I would give the game a 8/10\nToday, it gets a 3/10.\n\n+1 digging it up and making it available again.\n+1 nostalgia\n+1 somewhat playable today, but barely.","February 10","true","0.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
