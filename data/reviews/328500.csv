Unfair in the sense that, if you're reasonably skilled at platforming, you'll most likely die to randomness (falling eggs, rocks, etc.) way more than anything else. Normally I'd recommend people stay far, far away from games that utilize randomness as a way to increase difficulty, but in this game it works. It works because the randomness fits perfectly in with the game — both thematically and gameplay-wise. And the game is short enough that the random deaths don't become too frustrating. (I realize that that sounded a lot like a backhanded compliment, but I assure you, it isn't meant as such.) It's the kind of game that makes me wish I had friends who were interested in platformers so I could share the experience with them.\n\nThird, the game is hilarious and silly. Stop worrying and learn to love the troof.","December 3, 2014","true","1.1"," 65 of 73 people (89%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","89","65","73","12","0"

Between that and the 20-minute length, I can't really recommend this as a $4 game...\n\n...but it's kind of amusing and I'm glad it exists.

I have to imagine this was some sort of gimmick to push the average played time up, because there's no way you could spend 5 hours playing this game unless you hate yourself.\n\nGraphics are typical of a pixel game, but honestly they're not interesting.\n\nGameplay is extremely short, and the mechanics are boring. The levels aren't interesting or challenging enough to feel like you've accomplished anything significant if you aren't shooting for the Enlightenment achievement (no continues), and outside of one or two tough spots, the whole thing is pretty easy. The last level was a bit more interesting because there were actually a few physics challenges, but that's not enough to make up for the poor quality of the rest of the game.\n\nControls feel crude, but managable. There were a few points where I had issues jumping, but it wasn't a huge deal.\n\nIn terms of value, this is not worth the full price by any means. I honestly wouldn't recommend it on sale, either. If you happen to pick it up in a bundle, I'd say go ahead and give it a shot - otherwise, don't waste your money. There are better games out there at lower prices. The DLC is just the OST, and there aren't enough tracks in the game to justify buying it unless you really enjoyed them.\n\nPass on this one.","March 25","false","5.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

My first play through was about 30 minutes with a hell of a lot of dying. Then I tried again for the second achievement (no continues) and managed to complete it in 10 minutes. The only reason most people are spending 3 hours on the game is to get the trading cards. There's pretty much no replayability and I found it was pretty easy after playing it through the first time, however the first time be prepared to die a lot...\n\nWhilst the game is fairly fun though and has a massive learning curve but once you get past it, it get's repetitive. I can only see people who speedrun games seeing the value in this (in fact, seems like the community are geared towards this as well as there being a dedicated in-game speedrun timer).\n\nI don't know how much I paid for it but I assume it was from one of my hundreds of bundles. £2.79 seems a little expensive for a 10 minute game (and there is really not much to it) so I'd only really recommend it if it's in a sale for cheap and you really like it.","June 10, 2015","false","3.1"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","4","6","0","0"

This is the studio at its very best. Potatoman Seeks the Troof is a platform game\n\nIt’s short: You can complete the game in 30 minutes and that includes dying… and dying… and dying… a lot!\n\nIt’s not fair: Platformer fans demand games where death is always fair or at least fair a significant percentage of the time. Even the greatest platforming players will find themselves dying quite a bit. Usually this is a frustration that beggars belief. Why make a game so dependent upon randomness? Because in rare cases it absolutely works. This is one of those examples. It’s one of the few games where you’d expect nothing less than abject randomness and Pixeljam deliver it in spades.\n\nOdd pacing: I really don’t quite understand the decision making process Pixeljam had in regards to the pacing in this game. You start off with easy as you have come to expect from platform games. However, then you progress to what I would argue is the most difficult part of the game – the dreaded forest levels.  It’s difficult more so because you will die due to the random nature of the game more so than a lack of skill but it is made to feel like a combination of both. I nearly quit the game at this stage because I was raging so hard… But then again perhaps that was their point. Weird pacing that is oddly satisfying once you beat the stage.\n\nIncredible trailer: In complete and utter seriousness this is one of the best trailers I’ve ever seen because of its utter hilarity. What a fantastic way to sell your game.\n\nPotatoman Seeks the Troof is a great little platform game full of randomness and quirkiness that just works.\n\nFor reviews similar to this and our daily giveaways please visit http://www.steamified.com/","January 23","true","6.0"," 9 of 16 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","9","16","0","0"

The game shows this  Randomness heavily from the second area, having the player dodge on a whim where projectiles will land, sometimes even having to die since they won't be able to evade anything.\n\nAll in All, I really want to recommend this.

Me however?...\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sg-wtsocxHY\n(If the video is removed:  "Hahahaha!

"Troof" is essentially a goal you quest for in this simplistic indie platformer.  However, you'll find that it's of a similar flavor to Cat Mario, so you will find yourself dying....often.  Once you figure it out, the game can be simple...but also tedious if you don't have good timing.  (I'm looking at YOU boulders of level 4!!!)\n\n\nPROS:\n+Nostalgic to Atari\n+Decent platforming\n+Short\n\nCONS:\n-A game of trial and error\n-Moments where timing won't help you, but luck will...maybe\n-No savepoints if you choose to turn off the game\n\nOverall, I can't recommend this game, even if it is a little humorous (and a good excuse to try voicing the characters).  The game doesn't justify the price either.  Wait for a sale or a giveaway if you truly want this title.  The game can be finished twice in 1 hour on my end...for you?

It's a basic 2D platformer with repetitive quick deaths, but it's got a unique style to it, and there is just something compelling about the story. And the environment will react in ways you wouldn't expect, which will both amuse and upset you. Very surreal game that keeps messing with your expectations. If you follow your curiosity to the end of this short journey, your mind will be blown. Baffled. Bemused. Bewildered. Perhaps even befuddled. And it really is quite beautiful. What is the deal with this game? I don't know, but it was an interesting ride, and I feel closer to the troof for it. For troofseekers and potato eaters, I recommend playing through this game at least once. It definitely sticks with you. The gameplay is nothing special, yes, but this is an unforgettable experience.\n\n100th review! Not writing this to claim that or anything, but that's pretty cool.

It's an insanely twisted, brilliant platformer.\n\nBut don't play Potatoman if you've played any of these. It will just make you sad. It's a weird, distressingly mundane version of 'I Wanna Be The Guy'. It's been done to death already.

If you look to pay significantly more or less than that amount, this review isn't as relevant.\n\nSummary: Potatoman Seeks the Troof is a lighthearted platformer that was challenging for all of 30 minutes. That's it. There is a bit of story that adds some value to the game but overall it's about the gameplay.\n\nThe Good: The platforming is well made and the bits of story are enjoyable and made me laugh.\n\nThe Not so Good: This game is really short. You can see I have about 40 minutes in the game and I have zero need to ever go back. There is a togglable speedrunner timer that attempts to add some replayability but I would imagine most people won't be interested.\n\nThe Verdict: Seeing how I payed less than a quarter, this game did a lot right in terms of entertainment. As much as I want to demand more from the game, it's hard to justify punishing the it when it's so cheap. Well, it's not that hard.\n\nScore: 7/10   -3 for length.","December 31, 2015","true","0.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I just bought this off ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ to get another extra game in my steam library but I might try it sometime because it seems fun and weird and pretty challenging.\n\nWell since of the like recommendation rules that I have to play it for atleast 5min, I played it for 10min and it was extremely fun though pretty hard and a bit frustrating. It is very difficult and you need to learn the patterns in the level.

It's more like a retro acid trip than a retro art style.  The music is also nice too.\n\nThe game is short, can be finished in 30 min, and is worth playing. The platforming/challenges are kind of a more forgiving "I wanna be the guy" style where the rules are always changing on you and the point is to figure those out.  The surreal nature of the art, 'story elements' and this mutating gameplay all work together to make a short but cool experiment.","December 29, 2014","true","0.5"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Sometimes all you need is a stick, a ball, and an endless road.\n\n\n\nGameplay: 82/100 B-\nPotatoman Seeks the Troof is a little game that took me two minutes to download and just a few more to finish, but those were some of the most enjoyable minutes I have had with such an easy game. You have two controls: left, right, and jump. With those at your disposal, you make your way jumping and dodging various obstacles. You will soon learn that this game is not easy at all. Obstacles don't just sit, some jump, some grow, some multiply right into your path, and so on and so forth, it's enough to keep you on your toes...that is until you figure out the patterns for most of them. The aerial obstacles are a bit more difficult to navigate, which actually makes the replayability a little bit better.\n\nAudio: 70/100 C-\nThe sounds, like the gameplay is simple and basic, reminiscent of the Colecovision and Atari era of gaming, both paying homage and still being a modern game. It's charming, but nothing special.\n\nVisuals: 74/100 C-\n8-Bit galore, at first. The game sports the simplest of graphics, having a ton of colors and animations here and there, but things come alive when you die, of all places, as a semi 3D, blue and red hue filters everything and spins away.\n\nContent: 75/100 C\nLike I mentioned at the start, this isn't a particularly long game, but it is one you can play at a party over and over, it's simple enough that anyone can get, has enough variety to keep it challenging and definitely something you can share with others. And I'm sure kids will have more fun with this game than they will with Flappy Bird.\n\nDesign: 75/100 C\nWhen dealing with the limited movements it really isn't hard to screw up and while they're not perfect, they are solid and do what they need to do. Sometimes there is some detection issues, but then again, that could just be me as well.\n\nPerformance: 80/100 B-\nPotatoman plays very well on my PC and probably works very well on the mobile platforms as well. It isn't processor heavy at all and doesn't have the common issues higher end games.\n\nVerdict: 76/100 C+\nIt's charming. It's cute. It's colorful. It's solid. Share it to your friends. Give it to a kid. It'll keep them occupied. It's nothing grand, but not everything needs to be.","February 18, 2015","true","0.1"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

I just bought this off ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ to get another extra game in my steam library but I might try it sometime because it seems fun and weird and pretty challenging.\n\nWell since of the like recommendation rules that I have to play it for atleast 5min, I played it for 10min and it was extremely fun though pretty hard and a bit frustrating. It is very difficult and you need to learn the patterns in the level. I'd say its totally worth to buy.","April 18, 2015","true","8.0"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

You will go to the ends of the earth if you must. The need to find the troof is so prevalent that you won't let anything get in your way.  Don't let the others discourage you on your journey.  They are blinded in ignorance and feel threaten by your ambitious inquiry.  By going against the flow you put your life on the line.  The world is out to get you and it will throw everything it has at you to slow you down.\n\nPotatoman Seeks the Troof is as much an experience as it is a game.  You take on the role of the potatoman on his way to enlightenment.  In an adventure like no other you'll travel through the desert, jungle, city, and beyond.  Everyone along the way will tell you your wasting your time.  They may even throw stuff at you or try to run you over but you will persist.  Many obstacles lay in your way and you'll have to jump over or dodge them if you wish to proceed.  You are bound to be stuck down a couple times but the set backs are small and you'll learn how to navigate very quickly.\n\nThe music throughout this experience is wonderful.  The catchy 16-bit inspired tunes will cheer you on as you progress.  Each stage has a unique fun track that are all themed wonderfully to the contents of the level.  The sound-effects are simple and effective fitting in perfectly with the rest of the game.\n\nThis is a grand journey but I will note that its not particularly long.  However, its well worth the very reasonable price of admission.  The variety in this adventure is incredible and the story is absurdly amusing.  You are constantly excited to see what crazy thing will happen next.  Its impossible to predict all the wild things that this game will throw at you.  This game will keep you guessing until the very end.  There a very satisfying feeling to completing this trek and I hope you get the chance to experience it for yourself.","February 14","true","4.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You can try harder for the "Don't die" achievement, but if you're just gonna play it...well, get it on the cheap.\n\nWhat is the game?  It's a hard platformer with Atari style graphics and no real sense of humor, point, or direction.  It's a pretty simple game, with some interesting gimmicks but...again, this is a half hour game.  There's not a hell of a lot it can do.  It also, for some reaosn, uses a life system that makes you restart the level if you get a game over.  It feels like little more than a time waster, and considering this game is high on the difficulty scale, it's an irritation if you get stuck on something.  The 4th level in particular has A LOT of difficult obstacles, especially the last one, that just mean you're playing the level over and over.\n\nUnless you must have every Steam game or you're really entertained by truth being misspelled, skip it.","May 9","false","4.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
