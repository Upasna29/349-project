In Concrete Jungle you assemble decks of building cards and arrange them to get points for each column of the different levels. Clear a certain amount of columns and you’ll eventually reach the end of the level.\n\nOne thing worth mentioning, this game is not a city builder in anyway. The puzzle and deck-building elements play a huge role in Concrete Jungle’s gameplay whereas the city planning theme does nothing other than influence what the cards are. This isn’t a bad thing, just something worth bearing in mind if you’re considering buying it.\n\nPresentation\nAs you can see from the store page, Concrete Jungle is a very pretty game art style-wise and the rest of the game’s presentation is also excellent. The main menu is basic and easy to navigate and the game’s user interface is useful without taking up too much screen space as well as fitting with the overall look of the game.\n\nGameplay\nConcrete Jungle is all about building a deck of cards that work well together and then using those cards effectively. Before most levels (some levels, for example the tutorials, don't let you choose your own deck) you must build a deck of twelve cards, choice is somewhat limited as the game prevents you from having too much of a specific card type, e.g. you can’t have more than four houses in your deck. Once you’ve chosen your deck you’ll begin either a solo or versus match. A solo match is very much just a puzzle game where you need to place your cards effectively so you get enough points on each column (a column is made up of six individual tiles) to clear that column (more on this later). In versus mode each column (except the first one) is split into three sections; two tiles for you to build on, two tiles for your opponent to build on and two tiles that either of you can build on. Versus requires that you find a good balance between collecting more points for yourself as well as preventing your opponent from collecting points.\n\nIn Concrete Jungle you have several different types of buildings, the main ones being point collecting buildings, positive point modifiers and negative point modifiers (these names aren’t used during the game, I’m just using them to more easily describe them). Point collecting buildings simply collect the points that are on a given column space though there are some rarer cards which give you extra points as well as collecting them. Positive point modifiers are buildings which have a positive impact on one or more tiles by increasing the number of points available by building on said tiles. Some positive modifiers also have negative impacts on other tiles, choosing a variety of these two types of positives is key. Lastly negative point modifiers are effectively the opposite of the positive ones though the negative ones usually bring a bonus of some sort with them.\n\nClearing columns/earning points will eventually award you skill points which can either be spent on skills or can be used to unlock special cards for your deck. There are a couple of other gameplay elements but these are more minor and are well explained by the early tutorials so I feel it’s not worth me explaining them.\n\nAudio\nConcrete Jungle’s sound effects are excellent, often making the game sound like a real town/city. Music is also very good, has a nice relaxing feel to it. Voice acting is where the audio really shines. Concrete Jungle has a campaign mode which does have a (sort of) story to it in which all the dialogue lines are voiced. The voice actors are absolutely fantastic and do a great job at getting across the game’s humour.\n\nMiscellaneousAs mentioned the game does have a campaign mode featuring a story with some excellent humour.\nMultiplayer is local only and the dev has no official plans to add online multiplayer which I was a tad bit disappointed by.\nThe game is incredibly challenging and you won’t be able to stop playing until you beat that one level you find so difficult.\nConcrete Jungle has a great tutorial which explains all gameplay elements very well, really easing you into the game (not to say the tutorials are easy, they’re just slightly less hard than the usual levels).\nMore cards to use in your deck are unlocked as you progress through the game.\nVerdict\nWorth Purchasing\n\nConcrete Jungle is an excellent mix between a puzzle game and a deck-building game. With its great presentation, complex yet fun gameplay and amusing storyline it’s well worth the price of admission.\n\nReview Copy Provided.\n\nNo drama, Just Reviews.\n\nEl K.","September 25, 2015","true","5.8"," 80 of 88 people (91%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","91","80","88","3","7"

Even if you don’t like them, you’ll find something to love in this game, whether you’re a hardcore gamer, a regular gamer, or even just a casual gamer.\n\nI found Rome a city of bricks and left it a city of marble.\n\nAugustus Caesar\n\nWithout any further delay, I present to you my review of Concrete Jungle.\n\nGameplayStarting with an interesting concept, Concrete Jungle (CJ) starts captivating its players with its pleasing looks. Those (small) few that didn’t find CJ’s looks to be enough, will, undoubtedly find its gameplay incredibly entertaining. Those brave enough to start with the tutorial/campaign might feel some extra difficulty, but fret not, as the game is quite intuitive. The more points, the better!\nThe objective is pretty simple (for the vs mode): whoever has the most points at the end of the game wins. Those points are obtained by placing point-holding cards and providing them with points, whether by using plus-points buildings, or by increasing the block size therefor gaining bonus points. Points are calculated after the first column is either full or one of the players has reached the goal for that column.\nObviously, not every player is the same, so the strategy is up to them. From an aggressive stance, to a more defensive one, or even a strategy to disrupt your opponent, there’s a number of ways to defeat your opponents, whether by crushing them, or by simply slightly outscoring them. There’s also the possibility of the strategy backfiring, due to a bad deck choice, or even because the opponent’s deck/strategy was a good counter to yours.\nThere’s also the solo mode, which consists of reaching the column goals until the map finishes.\nAside from the cards, there’s also a Card Shop and a Skills tab, where you can use your purchase points, as well as an expenditure bar, which will make the column goals go up once you fill the bar.\nThe campaign is filled with a entertainment, from both the dialogue and the characters. It’s also quite challenging, so you must bring your A game, or gain some more experience. If those aren’t enough, don’t worry, the more you play, the more cards will be made available.\n\n\nPros Thorough tutorial;\nPerky and delightful graphics;\nIncredibly challenging campaign, with an increasing difficulty;\nComical dialogue between the characters makes the campaign much more interesting;\nWide variety of cards and effects;\nAddictive gameplay;\nMultiple game modes;\nUser-friendly UI;\nLevel system that prevents everything to be available from the start.\nTruthfully, I could only find one real “Con”.\n\nCons Multiplayer is only for local games.\nVerdictEssential purchase. I found myself speechless when I started writing this review, as I didn’t know how to start it. Hopefully I’ve done justice to it. It’s indeed a fantastic game, my favorite card game without a question. It’s as addictive as it is entertaining.","September 23, 2015","true","26.9"," 53 of 69 people (77%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","77","53","69","3","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/stubar/recommended/400160/","stubar","stubar","http://steamcommunity.com/id/stubar/","1648 products in account","What seems to be the most pertinent question about Concrete Jungle is whether it is in fact a city-building game?  If your definition equates to constructing various types of building and having to consider their placement due to effecting factors like the economy and technology levels, then yes it is a city-builder!  Is it in the same ilk as something like Sim City?  No.\n\nI’d personally slate Concrete Jungle down as a puzzle game primarily.  One that looks fairly simplistic in nature due to its colourful and clear-cut appearance, but spend a few hours in the game and the complexities reveal themselves pretty fast.  The game requires a constant level of concentration, planning moves ahead, saving certain buildings or certain tiles to be used later, at the most efficient time.\n\nThere are various game modes but the main objective in all modes is to clear columns of your “city”.  This is done in single-player mode by reaching a column target that will increase as the game progresses.  Playing versus the AI you will have to beat your opponent’s column score to claim your column points and their column points too.  If neither you nor the AI reach the column target you both collect your individually accrued points total.\n\nPlaying versus the AI is a wonderful piece of game design, it is so suited for playing against a human opponent.  Sadly this is reserved only to be played locally in hot seat fashion.  The developer has stated that online multiplayer will not be added.  This is really sad as the potential fun for playing online is huge.\n\nThe buildings at your disposal are distributed via a card system of which there are currently two hundred and five individual cards!  They are separated into six different tiers of cards and vary in how powerful they are.  Part of the strategy of the game is to influence your deck to your advantage, replacing less useful cards with more powerful cards.  There is a lot to consider and keep track on.\n\nI played through the campaign which maybe took 25 hours or so to get three stars in each level.  I was anticipating after finishing the campaign that the game might go stale without having any multiplayer mode but the game includes leaderboards and the fun continues trying to improve your own score and chase others higher up in the rankings.\n\nI find it very difficult to fault Concrete Jungle in any way.  Even the OST fits perfectly and the voice acting is equally charming!\n\nI can wholeheartedly recommend Concrete Jungle especially to those that enjoy a puzzle game that demands focus and requires concentration to be successful.","January 12","true","43.0"," 29 of 35 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","29","35","2","8"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thatfuzzytiger/recommended/400160/","thatfuzzytiger","Hobbes","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thatfuzzytiger/","3204 products in account","Disclaimer: I was a low level backer for this game, however, this does not affect my stance concerning the review, as I've kept distance beyond offering some feedback on ideas and suggestions. Read on good people!\n\nUpon concrete foundations and a MegaCity spirit does this jungle grow strong...\nCole Jeffries, a.k.a, Cole Powered should be held up as the model of "Kickstarters done right." He asked for the most modest of sums. A trifling £3,000 to cover art, asset, voice and pre-production costs for the spiritual successor to the fairly successful mobile game Megacity. He had a prototype ready to release to backers, so anyone who pitched in would get to tinker with the core gameplay loop and see what was on offer, and as far as tiers go, this was impulse backing territory. In the end he got over £13,000 from a core of dedicated fans of all shapes and sizes, enough to substantially expand the game, furnish it with various flourishes, but at the same time he stuck rigidly to his project goal. To make Concrete Jungle happen.\n\nWhat came out of that £13,000 was glory. A simple, yet absolutely devious and devillish game that epitomises the concept of "Simple to grasp, hard to master", there's an awful lot of high level play, especially when you get into the versus mode (oh the shennanigans you can pull there). But more on that below. Over the course of the kickstarter, Cole communicated clearly, posted progress reports in a timely manner, ensured that fresh betas were made available, so backers could provide feedback, and a lot of suggestions were folded into the final product.\n\nTaking Megacity and improving what it did right.\nMegacity was a really, really good mobile game. It could easily swallow hours of your life, and there's an awful lot of love for it, but there was a sense that some strategies could eventually allow you to keep ahead (at least to some extent) for quite a period of time. With Concrete Jungle, Cole Powered has had the opportunity to revisit the core formula of megacity, and then take it apart, looking at the concept of deck building and turn it into a fully fledged card game a-la Ascension, Chronicle of the Godslayer, where you start with a set of starter cards, and as your city evolves, you purchase progressively higher level cards which permit more advanced strategies and combos.\n\nIn addition to this deckbuilding concept, Cole also introduces the concept of "One shot" cards, disposable cards which when used, are destroyed and no longer recycled within your deck, forcing you to make hard decisions with each of your card purchases, because powerful cards are often "one shots", you're forced to decide between building an expanded pool of weaker, but more stable cards, or buying those powerful one shots, and then falling back on your base cards when they're spent.\n\nAs an alteration to the core game mechanic, it's genius, it instantly turns the deckbuilding into something that fosters a level of strategy and planning, and your purchases become the material of much headscratching as a purchase early on may have repercussions some fifty or even eighty turns down the line. You're no longer reliant on the old mobile strategies that pervaded megacity because the old strategies no longer -work-.\n\nCome for the campaign, stay for the Custom games and Versus mode!\nOn top of this is the cast of characters, all voice acted and in the campaign, brilliantly narrated, with dry british humour interspersed with some PG-13 rated jokes that even in the early stage got a wide grin from this tiger. Cole has managed to create a story that whilst it's no Lord of the Rings, it'll keep you amused as you work your way through, unlocking the various characters and winding your way through a set of maps that have their own unique challenges and trials. Puzzles that will test your brain to breaking point.\n\nEven when you've finished those, custom games await, and versus mode, where you can play the AI or even other real people in a battle to see who really is the king of the jungle. The gameplay in the Versus may prove yet to be Concrete Jungles' finest moments, the level of potential chicanery and backstabbing that you can achieve by clever use of buildings that have negative effects is -beautiful-, provoking strategies that normally would otherwise not even be considered.\n\nClosing thoughts\nIt's been a long time since I've used this word on the end of a review. But for Concrete Jungle, I have no other word I can use for it. I absolutely insist people try it out, and I entirely recommend to any puzzle gamer, or strategy buff, that they immediately make space in their gaming budget, and make a few good evenings with a hot drink ready. This game deserves your time, your attention, and your brain.\n\nVerdict : Essential\n\nWriter for the Just reviews group.

You have to fill each row of the grid with the requested amount of points by building buildings that give points and houses, which are required to collect those points.\n\nPros:    Innovative Gameplay | A mix of card, puzzle and strategy games is a very unique combo, but the developer managed to make it awesome. It is enjoyable, simple to understand and really well made.\nColourful Visual Look | As you can see from the Store screenshots, this game has bright and detailed graphics that are pleasant to look at. I must also point out that the way characters look like reflects their personality really good.\nMultiple Game Modes | Apart from the story, there are also AI and Versus modes, which are in my opinion great fun.\nStory and Voice Acting | The story is well-written, funny and is fully voice-acted. The voices were apparently acted by some very talented people as the tone of the voice and its vividness are respect worthy.\nCard System | The whole concept of the game is based on cards. You have a pre-built deck, from which you get 5 random ones. From the top few, you can choose the card you want to place on the grid. Each card has its positive and negative effect. Those effects are well-balanced and almost no card is overpowered.\nSoundtrack | The soundtrack is written by multiple musicians and their creation fits perfectly into the game. As it is copyrighted, there is also an option to skip all of the protected tracks, just in case you're recording your game for Youtube.\nSteam Integration | There are Trading Cards, Achievements, Cloud saving and even Leaderboards!\nCons:    Lack of Tutorial | Although there is a tutorial in game, it is spoken by one of the characters in the game. It is embedded into the story and is, therefore, a bit longer than some people can handle, so a lot of people might skip the text. There should be a menu in which the rules would be explained in a fast way.\nSingle OS Support | In this modern age of multiple operating systems and gaming on them, I am surprised by the lack of Linux and MacOS support.\nResolution Issues | If you are using a bit more unusual resolution, like I do, the red arrows that should point to specific buttons or other objects are misplaced. Mostly, you will still be able to figure out what the game wants to show you.\nThe final verdict:As this game is great-looking and has quality content, I would certainly advise you to buy it. It has also been featured by Nerdcubed, which usually proves that the game is good. There is plenty of missions and even co-op mode, so you should enjoy for plenty of hours.\nIf you are a fan of puzzle or card games, you should really consider to purchase it.\n\nGreetings,\nBirdCute\n\nNote that my copy of this game was obtained for free for reviewing purposes.

This is a well thought-out mixture of strategy, puzzle, city building (the game story is set in a city building environment) utilizing a deck of cards to influence the evolution of the city grid.\n\nYour deck will consist of Residential, Commercial, Industrial, Government and Environmental (parks) cards. Each of these cards (with the exception of residential, which are point cards) have a number of colour tiles attached to them. The red tile is a negative point and the blue tile a positive point.  Your goal is to clear each column of the grid until you reach the one with the checkered flag. However, each column has a points target to reach in order to be cleared.\n\nSometimes you will stuff up, well… If you’re like me it will be a déjà vu over and over again; but do not worry, you will have 2 hearts (lives) up your sleeve to clear your mistakes. Some of your cards will have development points; accumulate these points and you will be able to purchase skills and well-needed new cards. You will also unlock new cards as you reach new levels playing the campaign.\n\nYou will be able to play a campaign, solo, against 4 players (AI or local multiplayer) and classic modes.\nThe graphics are good and the game runs smoothly.

It's not actually got anything to do with city building, and the difficulty ramp is simply brutal - which is generally fine so long as people are aware, but games take a REALLY long time and you don't get any warning if the later terrain is stacked against your character or not.\n\nAs a card game, I'd class it as a deck builder (like Marvel's Legendary) played on a board; you start each game with a shallow pool of tier 1 cards (which you do get to customize with a limited range you unlock while slowly leveling), and you gain more - or replace them - by spending economy points from placing particular structures. You don't keep cards between games, beyond unlocking them for your starting slection/randomized pool.\n\nThere are 5/6 card colours, but most are only useful/viable to a single character so helpful unlocks are pretty far apart (they don't generally clog you up too bad though, as you get a random selection of 4 to choose from when purchasing in-game). I did not find the characters to be remotely balanced; there's a woeful techie guy who posed no resistance at all (no point scoring abilities in a point scoring game), then at the opposite end of the spectrum there's a military lady who scores points in an inverted fashion - which gives her free reign to 'poison' the entire board, which is an incredible hinderance to others and gains her massive economic advantage.\n\nPositives\n+ Unique (on PC - not sure about table-top)\n+ Good game if you're looking for a challenge & can play for long sessions\n+ Charming\n\nNegatives\n- Brutal diffculty\n- Games are very long & not very dynamic\n- Questionable balance\n- Not actually anything to do with city building","September 26, 2015","false","3.4"," 27 of 38 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","27","38","0","0"

The combinations of cards and randomness can make for agonizing decisions.\n\nYou start with a set of basic cards (which you can change).  Cards largely represent buildings of various types.  Your goal is to use these cards to earn points for each "row" of land.  You can earn more cards/skills during a scenario, but cards that give you currency typically have drawbacks, so you will need to balance your economy and point getting at the same time.\n\nThe campaign is engaging, with a decently entertaining backstory that pushes it along.  The campaign introduces new elements and features gradually, but quickly enough that you shouldn't get bored.  Each scenario gives you have limited space and resources to achieve your goal, sometimes throwing you a curveball (for example, Coalfields has the AI place a random building down every 4 turns, disrupting your carefully laid plans).\n\nCharacters each have their own set of "Skills" that you unlock during a given play, lending to varied playstyles and replayability.\n\nAudio\n====\nDecent ambient sound, but the highlight is the soundtrack.  Not obstrusive but easy to listen to.  You might even find yourself humming along after awhile!\n\nVoice Acting was a surprise - a pleasant one, I quite enjoy the narration/dialog, as tropey as they are sometimes.\n\n\nGraphics\n======\nSurprisingly good graphics for what, at first glance, appears to be a low-budget title.

It’s a score-based puzzler, and a fairly unforgiving one at that.\n\nFor people who like the relaxed tempo and forgiving tone of the city building genre, this is almost certainly not going to be your game.\n\nWhich should not be read as implying that Concrete Jungle is not a good game, it’s extremely well done and recommended.\n\nGame play progresses broadly as follows.\n\nEach block (buildings, fields, etc.) is a "card". Cards are generally divided into two types, scoring blocks (houses) and everything else (parks, industry, fields, etc.) which either buff or nerf the scoring blocks (or both buff and nerf blocks).\n\nCards are fed randomly forward from your deck with only the top two available to play immediately, with some extra cards visible so that you know what's coming up in advance. (Although in the early campaign levels cards and layout are fully scripted - this can be brutal when you're still not 100% confident of how the mechanics work.)\n\nTo progress forward you have to score 3 points in each row before that row is removed and a new row created at the end (later on, the points required per row increase). If you can't get 3 points in a row you lose a life in order to delete that row and let the game progress. After you've lost a certain number of lives the game ends.\n\nThe game includes a solo mode where you have to complete a certain number of rows before running out of lives. There is also a verses mode (hotseat or against the AI) where each player takes turns playing three cards each on a partially shared game board.\n\nThere are a number of additional complicating factors like buying cards and abilities, and experience, which add complexity but don't substantially change the core gameplay.\n\nStrategy is basically about ensuring an even placement of buff and nerf cards while ensuring that the minimum score is achieved in each row so that you can continue to progress.","September 26, 2015","true","5.1"," 25 of 35 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","25","35","0","3"

Is it a strategy? Yes. Is it an Indie? Yes. Is it a Tetris-like game? Yes. Is it procedurally generated? Yes. Is it a Rogue-lite? Yes. Is it Ironman? Yes. Does it involve competition? Yes. Can you play it for hours and hours on end? YES!!!\n\nI was absolutely surprised just how much the game did right. So, in true fashion, let's take at the good and the Bad.\n\nThe Good:\n\n1. Awesome AI. I love AI that can make my life a living hell. The AI will exploit your mistakes, take advantage of them, and crush you, rather than just hang back and let you feel all good for beating it.\n2. An ever changing world - be it on Campaign, or on custom, you need to plan for the future and play accordingly. I love this about a game, as it doesn't force you to take a level after another like a zombie.\n3. Pleasant graphics and relaxing music.\n4. Learning as you go - some people have complained that the game is hard - it is not. You just need to let it teach you, and then crush your opponents with a huge point lead.\n5. A card collection game - lots and lots of cards to collect, and that in itself, makes you play it over and over again till you find the bestcards that would suit your deck, principles, philosophy, and pattern of playstyle.\n6. Buildable decks - if you're into card games, this will reel you in big time. Based on your deck, you can do various builds and play or throw your opponent off big time.\n7. Thinking a number of moves ahead - as you have a complete visibility of the ever-changing field, your hand and the cards that come, you can plan a good number of turns ahead, just like in chess.\n8. Good replayability - as no two games are the same, you can have heaps of fun with this game, as the map layouts and the AI will challenge you big time.\n9. Good value for the money - right now the game costs twice the hours I played (7.2), and I easily see myself doing more and more of it. I expect to get my money's worth twice over.\n10. Even if I don't really care about settings menues and such, this game does provide a good amount of them.\n11. A nice amount of jokes that will put a smile on your face.\n12. The AI opponent diversity is great - from ones that will contest your city-beatutifying skills to those that will outright nuke your stuff, you will contantly be forced to adapt, and that is a huge bonus in my book.\n\nAnd now let's take a look at the BAD:\n\n1. Steep learning curve. You will need to do the walkthrough, get used to every character and play to their strengths on the fly. This is not as easy to do as it might sound. And don't get me started on card variety...\n2. You can lose games through no fault of your own. This for me is a huge gripe. I hate playing my best cards, or to the perfect strengths of my build and still lose because the opponent got lucky.\n3. No online MP. I hope the devs will add it, because local co-op without a coop partner is an SP game. While they did make the AI great, you will eventually get bored of it.\n\nConclusion:\n\nAs you see, getting used to the game and the multiplayer are its only huge setbacks. It is absolutely no wonder why it's so well accepted on steam. It does so much right - replyability, varying challenges, versus AI mode, procedural generation, cards, buildable decks, varying builds, puzzle-like mechanics, and whatnot.  If you're of fan of any of those genres, you will absolutely adore it.

What the heck does that even mean? Don't think SimCity, Anno or The Settlers. Buildings are placed on a board to collect points. No mining gold or production chains.\n\nBasically, the game goes like this. The board is arranged into columns. Buildings (cards) are placed onto the board for a variety of effects. Tiles can have a point value associated with it, either due to starting conditions or from the effect of played cards. Some cards can claim points, adding them to your score. Others have different effects - such as raise or lower the point value of tiles, moving the points from one tile and putting them on another, negating the value, and more. Most cards differentiate themselves by the pattern of tiles that they affect, but some of the special ones are a bit more interesting.\n\nOverall, I've had a good time with it. Since it is a deck building game, there is luck involved but I feel the player has enough agency to have enough of an effect on the outcome. The campaign wasn't too challenging until the final 4 scenarios or so. Two were particularly tough.\n\nSome players may be turned off by having to unlock characters by playing the campaign, and needing to play to unlock some cards, but I like having the carrots dangled in front of me.\n\nWhile I think competitive mode offers that most interesting decisions, and I enjoyed the competitive missions in the campaign, I don't think I'll revisit them in custom games. I'm kind of a score chaser by heart and there aren't any leaderboards for competitive mode. The AI did smartly place their buildings. I was glad the AI didn't blunder its way through the game.\n\nFrankly, I may try a handful of endless mode solo games with the different characters, but I feel that I've seen what the game has to offer. I enjoyed my time with Concrete Jungle and have played for 30 hours or so. To me, that's plenty for a $13 game. While I don't think it is probably on many people's' "Must Play" lists, Concrete Jungle is a solid game. In fact I wasn't even planning on writing a review, but after wrapping up the campaign I liked it enough so I wanted to share my thoughts.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cipherpunk/recommended/400160/","cipherpunk","Cipherpunk","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cipherpunk/","517 products in account","Let's get one thing straight: Concrete Jungle is not a city management simulation. That much should be apparent from the trailer but I think I failed to fully grasp it before I made my purchase. Youtubing some Let's Play videos would have probably been useful in this regard. Anyway, don't let that scare you away. Yes, even you, guy who has 2000+ hours in City: Skylines, along with faithful recreations of every major city in the world. You frighten me, but I admire your passion for building stuff.\n\nConcrete Jungle is a game that skillfully combines the heart of a city management simulation and the brain of a hardcore puzzler, gushing with style and substance. That was a mouthful so let me try that again:\n\nConcrete Jungle is a damn good game.\n\nWhen you start a game, you're given a handful of cards and a plot of land tiles arranged in a grid. The cards represent the various buildings you can construct and contain statistics and rules about their impact on your city. As you add new buildings to the plot, they'll often change the value of tiles around them. Shops and restaurants will add value whereas factories and landfills will cause nearby values to plummet. When all the cards are played, the deck is shuffled and you continue to draw from the fresh pile. What you want to do is play houses, which collect points, in high value areas to maximize your score. Scoring happens when you fill a row (the game refers to them as columns but I insist they are rows) with buildings and the value of those buildings hits your current target number. Like Tetris, the filled row is cleared and more space is created for buildings. How well you score is determined by how you min/max your placement of buildings. The round starts with a deck of a few basic buildings but more powerful buildings can be purchased from a semi-random pool with economy points. There's also a roster of eight different characters to play as with unique skill trees that are gradually unlocked as the round progresses.\n\nThe proceeding was an, admittedly, clinical explanation of what amounts to an utterly engrossing experience. The visuals are bright and charming and the music is a soothing backdrop for thoughtful play. Each of the campaign levels includes voice-acted scenes that may not be perfect but were still enjoyable. However, it was a relief to discover they could be skipped after failed attemps. There's also a strong flavor of city building which is well reinforced by it's 200+ buildings with well thought-out, thematic powers. Car dealerships target rich neighborhoods to give you economy points. Train stations add more points based on how many connections they create. Recycling centers can delete underpowered cards from your hand. Youth centers look to the future, allowing you to draw more cards and plan ahead etc. It was a ton of fun just figuring out why each building does what it does and this kind of mechanical immersion is exactly what makes Concrete Jungle such a brilliant game.\n\nThe game can be played solo but also includes a versus variant. Having not learned my lesson about preconceived notions, I imagined that this would be a tacked-on, horribly underdeveloped and unnecessary alternative to the "core" gameplay. Nothing could be further from the truth. Versus mode has both 1v1 and 2v2 variants (for the love of God, please add online multiplayer!) and changes the rules in a few key aspects. The most compelling difference is the scoring: the player with the most points in each row gets both theirs and their opponents points for that row, which is genius. What ensues is a sharp and tactical battle of risk and reward. It has some small elements of luck, sure, but ultimately, it favors players with a knack for planning and inventiveness. Many of the cards also have to be reevaluated in this environment and open the door for some very cool advanced strategies. That factory you don't want stinking up your valuable real estate? Perhaps your opponent will enjoy having it dropped right in the middle of their housing project. Because local multiplayer is currently the only option, I'm in the process of contriving a friends-on-the-couch situation solely so I can confound everyone with my competitive city engineering skills.\n\nConcrete Jungle has completely defied my expectations and I'm so glad that it did. It's a fantastic specimen in the genre of puzzle games. There's still a ton of content left for me to unlock and I expect to be playing this one for many, many hours to come.","September 28, 2015","true","22.7"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","100","11","11","3","0"

If you've played card games like Hearthstone or Castle Wars, you'll be familiar with the style already (cards that either buff or nerf the already-played cards on the table), however, instead of placing your cards on the table, you have a grid of city squares that you fill with each property card in the hope of adding a required number of points to each row.  When the left-most row reaches the required points, it vanishes (Tetris-style) and a new empty row is added on the right which you can then use to buff preceding rows that might not have reached sufficient points.  You collect points from every row you clear, and you earn points from partiular cards played that can be saved to buy rarer and more powerful cards, or alternatively upgrade your skills via a simple RPG-style skills tree.  The game ends either when you've earnt the prerequisite points to beat the town level, or conversely when the left-most row can no longer be cleared (at which point it's game over if you've run out of lives!\n\nWhat's to like?The just-one-more-go addictiveness of it!  It's maddening really.  All those posh, expensive games you have, but instead this one will usurp your time!  It has a good tutorial to start you off, and the characters add some humour to the game.  It's such a clever blend of ideas that sound bizarre on a storyboard: what if Simcity was played like Hearthstone, and rows must be cleared like Tetris?  The developers have quite the imagination to make this combination work, but it does!  Indie games just go from strength to strength when it comes to originality, and this game does not disappoint (hence the overwhelmingly positive review score).  The price at first gives the impression of being a little steep for a casual game, but that's the thing: it's NOT as much of a casual game as it first appears.  It has more depth and stretegy to it than Hearthstone, and an infuriating yet funny AI to confound your attempts to breeze through the game.\n\nAnything not to like?Only the most minor of things.  Like many more casual games, there are spoken bits (speech bubbles to read) at the beginning of the tutorial levels.  There is an awful lot to click through and, while you CAN skip them, buried within are some necessary tips and guidance that you won't want to skip at first (so bear with it).  Because there is a lot more to the game than first appears, it can feel like the game is throwing a lot at you all at once, but after a few replays you will start to understand how the different component parts of the game (deck balancing, upgrades, avoiding blocked rows and using nerfs in a constructive way) come together, and it feels simple yet challenging to play.\n\nIn summary...Concrete Jungle is  deceptively light-hearted and simple whilst offering a Hearthstone-style level of depth and strategy beneath its cartoony surface.  It's also surprisingly addictive (you have been warned)!  Highly recommended!","October 3, 2015","true","18.2"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","9","9","2","0"

It brings the level of difficulty up by adding to the mix a deck of cards; the cards feature buildings, each with pros and cons.You can only place buildings dealt from your deck, and you have a limited space to place them in - think of it as a deck and a board. Meanwhile, you must add up to a certain amount of points to ‘clear’ the first area of the board (called a column) so you can continue on building to the finish line. It might not make much sense explained like this, but once you look at the screenshots, you’ll surely understand better.\n\nThe game is very addictive. It offers a campaign mode, where you more or less follow a small story while you play through each stage with various different goals; and it also offers a “custom game” mode, the custom mode allows you to play solo (customizing how many lines or columns you want to make to the finish line as well as a few other things), play versus (local co-op or online), a luck-based version of solo (in which you have no deck, but random buildings to place on the board), and the ability to load a previous save file.\n\nI found that it was easy to pick up and leave at any given time - maybe not so much if you’re doing latter campaign stages, but if you play custom solo you can make quick games, and play in short little bursts or for longer periods of time according to your mood, so I think this game would be apt for casual gamers as well as those that like to play for hours on end. Unlike other games, where normally I get tired of trying to re-do a failed stages over and over, I didn’t have that reaction with Concrete Jungle. The modes offered a slight level of randomization when repeating a stage (some things were fixed, others weren’t), so that it didn’t really feel like a repeat each time.\nThe versus sessions can get a little ‘intense’ when both players are of a similar skill level, making for entertaining matches. Yet, I found the (forced) versus matches on the campaign mode a lot less fun to play through than the solo campaigns.\n\nWhether you play solo or versus you gain exp and level up, thus unlocking new cards to play in your deck.\n\nThe art of the game is very appealing, the soundeffects and music are pleasant and relaxing, and the voice acting surprisingly good. The puzzle aspect got increasingly difficult as the stages advanced and more game options were given to me: such as getting different cards or skills once I reached a certain amount of points, or when target rises if you use too much of another type of points, and so on... You have “lives”, too, which help you along the way if you can’t clear a column.\n\nThe mix of city building (although it’s arguably more of a puzzle than a city builder) and cards was very well executed and I’m happy to say I was pleasantly surprised by Concrete Jungle.\n\nI definitely recommend this game if you like puzzles, card games, or strategy type games, but it’s probably not for hardcore city builders.","September 26, 2015","true","6.6"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","1"

Not being a fan of the "fantasy" themes is one of the reasons that I never really got into them, since that excludes many of the common digital and physical games in this category.\n\nI'm however a huge fan of the building and management genre of games. I grew up playing hundreds of hours of Rollercoaster Tycoon, Sim City, Transport Tycoon, Zoo Tycoon, etc. So when I saw Concrete Jungle for the first time I thought it too was a game in this genre. Judging from other reviews and comments I'm clearly not the only one who thought this.\n\nJust to be clear: Concrete Jungle is NOT a city building game. It's a deck building game that looks like one. But it's a really fun game nonetheless. It looks and feels really nice with satining graphical and sound effects with every interaction. The AI is very competent and clearly communicates what it does by using the same interface as the player. And that is just as well because good luck finding another person to play this game with. You will have to find someone locally with a comparable skill level, otherwise their is no fun to be had. Concrete Jungle would have so much more replay value if it had a online multiplayer mode.\n\nWithout a online multiplayer mode I highly doubt that their are much people that get more out of this game than the 15 hours I had with it. 15 really fun hours, don't get me wrong. But I feel it could have been much more if I had reasons to keep coming back. Especially if I could play this on a tablet.

Luckily, I like puzzle games too, since I didn't do much research before making the purchase;)\n\nAt the outset, it all looks quite complicated - but after about an hour or so of figuring it out led to the realization that the core mechanic is very simple. It plays *a tad* like a turn-based Tetris, with many more piece varieties. The piece variety lends itself to feeling a bit like a deckbuilder, but again, that isn't the genre I'd put this game in, either.\n\nPros:\n+It is all very polished, right down to the voice acting.\n+Simple to learn, difficult to master.

This game is a truly beautiful card game with a dash of city builder that makes gameplay both simple and complicated at the same time.\n\nThe gameplay is simple enough. Your goal is to get the total value in each column to tally up to the required target until you've eliminated all columns on the board by setting down different types of cards (buildings) that can either raise or lower your total for a column. What ends up making the game so complicated (and so fun) is that it forces you to strategize how each card you place now might affect your chances of clearing a column in the next turn or many turns into the future. And so, this simple game becomes really complicated really quickly.\n\nThe art and the music are perfect and the gameplay is very solidly built. You can clearly see the developer has spent a lot of time balancing out the cards and creating a tutorial that goes a long way to make sure you have every advantage without completely holding your hand.

It tickles all the right puzzle-nerves. A nice game that is sure to bring many enjoyable hours to anyone who is in to puzzles, colours and city planning (no city planning actually required).\n\nThe mechanics of the game works in such a way that you clear a row at the bottom, which in turn adds another row at the top. A row is cleared if you have accumulated the target point value for said row.\nThe points in a row is gained by placing buildings in it's grid system; you start with a small suburban villa looking house, that in it self is worth 0 points, and you increase the value of it by placing shops, schools, parks etc. around it. Buildings like factories and such can lower the value of the plot. Some buildings, like the super market or the car wash, gives both positive and negative values to different squares around them; a house infront of the super market gains in value while a house behind the super market loses in value.\n\nBuildings of the same type (residential, industrial, farming etc.) that are placed next to each other forms a block, up to four buildings. Rare specialy buildings can influence a block such as giving every building in the block +1 points or even allow the block to contain more than four buildings. Here is where you find your combos.\nYou don't have to build on the nearest row, you can put your buildings down where ever there is room on the playing field, in order to stack up a combo or put a pesky factory for away in a corner.\n\nThe buildings you put down is taken from your "hand", where each building is represented by a card. When you have placed, or discarded a card due to a special event, you draw a replacement from your deck. Most cards are recycled throughout the session; played or discarded cards gets shuffled back into the deck. Some specialty cards though can be used only once; play or discard it and they're gone from the deck for that session. Note that no cards are lost forever, just for that stage/session/match.\n\nBuildings put down on the playing field affects not only the scoring, but can also add to one, two or both meters found in the upper right corner of the screen. When one meter is filled you get to either choose one new card (our of four randoms) to add to your deck for the session, or invest in a talent-tree-looking-thing which can give you either one of abilities like force clearing a row without spending a life or giving you a rare card to add to your deck for the session.\n\nAs you progress through the game you get to unlock several more cards to play with, and modify your deck. There are also different characters you get to pick, to act as your avatar, along with your deck, that influences the session in different ways.\n\n\n\nThough something that I wish was explained more thoroughly in the game (a good place would be in the tutorial) is the points and scoring system, as the difficulty quickly ramps up and you soon get only one or two stars out of three for each level, even if you cleared it with all your lives intact, and you are left to figure out by trial and error what actually gives you more/most points. It's an obstacle that isn't that hard to overcome, but it shouldn't be there in the first place.\nI hope the developer polishes this bump off of this otherwise enjoyable game.","September 25, 2015","true","4.1"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Awesome soundtrack, cute visual style, quirky and smart humor/writing, unique city planning and ‘building’ system. But I feel people should know what their getting into and the issues this game has.\n\nOne being the gameplay, far too many cards are locked at the start and it takes a very substantial amount time and XP to unlock them. Not that I have anything against unlocks or level systems I just feel the starting deck amount is not very diverse and the early games feel pretty ‘samey’ even with the different playable characters.  Another issue is how brutally unforgiving the game is. Again don’t get me wrong I feel too many games nowadays are cakewalks but theres a difference between being challengingly fun and just plain downright unfair. Too many times I’ll have a good row of points then in one swoop the AI gains a F**k you card and can trash the whole row instantly. Which in turn means you lost the half-hour match and gain absolutely ZERO XP at the end. It feels more like luck based rather than skill and the odds are ever not in your favor. Yeah, not my cup o’ tea or idea of a fun time.\n\nOther issues include the visual style. As mentioned above I do enjoy the overall look of this game but it feels somewhat ‘dead’ at times with how lively the music and spectacular voice acting is. The only animations are the cars zooming around the roads at 200mph, even when slowed down in the options, and sometimes the factories smokestacks plume flat identical smoke effects. And that’s about it, living breathing alive city this ain’t. No people walking around, no signs blinking on buildings, no windows being washed or parks bustling with patrons. There is a pretty nifty rain cycle but more details such as perhaps snow or clouds would have been great. Now from what I understand reading the Dev blog and news clips this game will eventually gain a day/night cycle and perhaps some more details. Here’s hoping.\n\nThere’s also a feeling of a lack of features. While theres no online multiplayer, which personally doesn’t bother me any, I feel that for what they were going for with the VS mode there should have at least been an LAN option. As is you have to share the same screen/PC to play it with another person. Also no Mac or Linux support? I can tell that decision has exiled a lot of potential players. The Steam Workshop would also be perfect for this game. Custom card creation or heck even actual card trading on the market that can be played in game like IRL games!\n\nIn the end, yeah I’m sorta kicking myself for spending full price getting this game. But at least I have the good feeling of supporting the little guys making games with their hearts and not mega corps only after the money. I’d say its sill worth getting 50% off, but consider the issues and read the other reviews here before buying so you really know what you’re getting yourself into.","January 24","false","22.3"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

This was not the case on either the city building or the deck building side. You are only building a city one column at a time and are restricted to a 6x7 tile grid. Based on the images of the game I was hoping that this was only the "view area" of my potentially huge city, not the confined space I get to work in. Additionally, you have very little control over what cards are in your deck. Each level of the campaign starts you with a specific set of cards that MUST be placed in a specific location/order to progress in the proper manner. If you don't you will lose lives or end up with a low score. Take note that you need a very high score to achieve 3 stars on a level, as well as to rank up and unlock new cards. You can buy cards in each level, but they only remain for that level, and only contribute the the pre-assigned deck for that level. Also, the cards you get to purchase are random so you have to be extremely lucky to get 1 benficial card out of the 4 you are presented at a time. My last complaint is that there is too much story for a "puzzle" game. Many levels you will have to play multiple times to get a good score. With unskippable dialog (as of v1.1.2) at the beginning of (and mixed into) each level, this added reduntant and wasted time to each level. I sank about 20 hours into this game to beat it, but I feel like I could have run through the whole thing in an enjoyable 5-10 if they had cut out the dialog and let me build my own decks. The custom games are SLIGHTLY better, but I think I probaby feel that way because there is no story attached.\n\nPros:\nBeatiful art style\nGood voice acting\nUnique building designs\nCons:\nUnskippable dialog\nMinimal deck configuration\nGameplay relies heavily on luck\nMost levels require multiple playthroughs\nHas a lot of "filler" that is used to take up time\nIs not the prequel to Predator: Concrete Jungle","December 28, 2015","false","19.1"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","0"

Part Deck Building, part Sim City, part puzzle game. The idea of the game is to lay buildings on a grid with the goal being to reach a certain population value on every row. Population points are obtained by placing different kinds of buildings to increase the point values of nearby spaces and then placing residential buildings on those spaces. Negative point values are possible which whilst obvious not ideal can be used in vs mode to shaft your opponent. Equally as you lay buildings you gain points which can be used towards stronger cards to add to your deck. The cards with negative values tend to add more to the population total.\n\nAs you play there are different characters to choose that have different skill trees that unlock cards and abilities. Some are inherently better for VS rather than solo play. In order to unlock access to later cards in the skill tree the player has to pick from a selection of random cards.\n\nFirstly let me start by saying the difficulty curve of concrete jungle goes from ridiculously steep to practically vertical. I cannot work out if I am just inherently bad at the game but even when writing this grading I am struggling to finish the campaign mode due to the games inherent difficulty and way smarter than me UI. As you play through the campaign mode it ranks each level by difficulty and within the first few levels they are ranked hard with no way of changing the difficulty. Another issue is levels are pretty long sometimes running at well over 10 minutes and there is no way to speed up the AI turns… you even have to watch them open the menu and choose their cards. This does not help when you fail on the last part of a stage… imagine if levels of candy crush took 15 minutes to beat.\n\nWould I recommend playing Concrete Jungle? Yes I would but only to a very hardcore crowd who love deck building and very difficult puzzle strategy games. I really enjoyed playing the game but it definitely got hard fast and with no adjustable difficulty setting and long games making it difficult to constantly retry it could frustrate you before you see the bulk of what the game has to offer. That being said I did keep coming back to the game and even after writing my original review I put in another few hours to get that little bit further. Make no mistake about it this is the Dark Souls of Puzzle games but if that’s your bag then this will be right up your alley.\n\nPlease check out our video review for more info and gameplay footage.\n\nhttp://www.thegametutor.co.uk/videos/game-tutor-grades/151004_game-tutor-grades-concrete-jungle\n\nA review copy of the game was obtained from the developers free of charge.

Concrete Jungle, a deck-building, city-planning game with puzzle elements does a great job of introducing itself. Throughout the campaign, each mission starts off with a little dialogue between the characters in the game. Each character is well voice-acted and the script was well written too. I normally skip cutscenes but I didn't feel the urge to as I thoroughly enjoyed the conversations.\n\nConcrete Jungle's campaign difficulty scales rather quickly. However, it is the only way to unlock more characters in the game. Each character has a unique deck playstyle and keeps the experience fresh. You can challenge each mission with any of the 8 unlockable characters in the game.\n\nApart from the campaign, the game allows for custom game creation with up to 3 different game modes, Solo, Classic and Versus.\n\nSolo and Classic game modes are pretty much the same with Classic mode letting luck decide how your deck builds. Versus mode on the other hand, plays out very differently from the other modes and surprised me with how fun it was. I hope the devs port this game to mobile platforms as Concrete Jungle would make a great game to play on the go.","October 7, 2015","true","14.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But as a card game or city-building game, there are flaws that you just can't ignore.\n\n--- As a strategy game, it's casual but serious ---\n\nIt's casual for you simply play cards and your city grows and the game goes on. Yet be careful, no much misatkes are allowed. If you occupy a whole row but collect no enough points, your heart (not literally) will be the cost to clear that row. So it's all about planning steps based on the cards you have (or you're going to draw) before you really execute them. The game could be really serious when you're trying to beat your friends' high score or competing with them in versus mode.\n\n\n--- As a card game, it might dissapoint card collecter ---\n\nDo you love card games for threre are cards to collect and decks to build? If yes, you should know the following facts. Firstly, you get new cards only by leveling up. There is no way to be "I just opned a pack and those cards I got were AWESOME!". Nope. NO PACKS! Only leveling up gets you new cards.\nSecondly, the size of the deck is pretty small, which is only 12. Your creativity could still play a role but would be limited. If you play this game over and over again, the cards showing up repeatedly will bore you for sure. Which means, in my opinion, it will never get you addicted, could be either good or bad depending on what player you are.\n\n\n--- As a city-building game, the theme is not develpment but expansion ---\n\nKeep it in mind: you will never get to see the whole city you "build" when the game is over. When some criteria are met, the left-most row will be cleared and the building on that row will vanish with it. At the same time, a new row will show up at the right-most edge. The rows keep emerging and disappearing until you clear the final row and finish the game. By playing cards, your city expands rightward and that's the only possibility. So is it really a citly building game? I doubt. For here is no way to be "Check it out! I just built a beautiful city on Concrete Jungle!". 100% sure that you will never see such post on Facebook or Twitter.\n\n\n--- To sum up ---\n\nConsidering it as a strategy game, I rate it 9/10\n\nConsidering it as a card game, I rate it 6/10\n\nConsidering it as a city-building game, I rate it 5/10\n\nAll in all,I reccomand the game but i suggest that you should buy it when discounted. Unless you really love strategy game and those cons in card game part and city-building game part don't bother you.\n","March 2","true","6.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

You get a deck of cards which you use to place buildings and other structures in the city. You place point collecting buildings and use other buildings' special abilities to build up the points that the building ends up scoring. Your objective is to score as many points as possible in each row since you need to score a certain number of points in each row in order to clear that row and open up a new row which you can place building on.\n\nThe deck building comes into play since you will earn economic points which can be used to purchase special abilities and cards that you can add to your deck.\n\nWhat I liked most about Concrete Jungle is that the game is easy to play but also allows for a lot of strategy. The game takes a while to adjust to but once you get a hang of it, you shouldn't have too much trouble with it anymore. You really need to plan out your moves though since a lot of the cards can be used to build combos that score a lot of points which help you clear levels.\n\nThe game has two main modes. I personally preferred the "solo" mode where you build the city by yourself. The game also includes a "competitive" mode where two players build on the same plot of land which requires an additional level of strategy as you try to build up your points while hindering your opponent.\n\nAt this time I have played the game for over seven hours and have not yet completed the campaign. I would guess that the campaign is at least ten hours. The story is pretty interesting and the graphics in the game are fantastic.\n\nConcrete Jungle will not be for everyone. If the game's concept doesn't seem interesting to you, you probably won't like the game. If you have any interest in the game though I think you will really enjoy the game.

This is not only false, this is purely misleading.\n\nThis game is a pure puzzle/casual game with city building cosmetics. You could swap buildings with gems or candies (or whatever) and it will change nothing to the core of the game. I do enjoy a puzzle game from time to time but I've found this one to be very shallow. The only real difficulty come from the fact that you dont see all the level from the start. You end up passing levels because you learn whats coming for you, not because you're getting better at solving the points/grid puzzles. One exemple: at the end of a level, you're gonna be blocked at the top of your grid, so you have to build your stuff at the bottom of it, from the start. You didnt knew it because its the firts time you try this level? Well too bad, you need to restart because theres was no way you could knew that in advance.\n\nThis game have somes pros (graphics are gorgeous, tutorial is well made) but for me, I'm going to ask for a refund.","December 24, 2015","false","0.7"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","53","8","15","0","0"

Concrete Jungle is a new take on the city building genre that swaps micro-management for a more strategic and puzzle-orientated style of city planning.\n\nYou have a deck of selected cards which you can use to place buildings. Each building will affect it's surroundings in different ways. The aim of the game is to clear city blocks by gathering the required number of points from your residents, giving more room to build. As the city grows, bigger and better new buildings can be added to your deck!\n\nAs you get opportunities to hone and refine your deck, residents will demand more from you. You'll find yourself inadvertently creating zoning puzzles- playing against your own past planning decisions.\n\nAlternatively engage in competitive city planning against challenging AI or local players. Take it in turns to place buildings in the same city and battle over the affection of your citizens! - Recommended!","November 12, 2015","true","0.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The art, voiceovers, feel, and most of all glorious unique gameplay are all absolutely top shelf. I could write pages and pages, and I would still feel that there wasn't enough evidence of the quality of this amazing game.\n\nFirst, the wrapping paper. Concrete Jungle looks and sounds amazing. From the routine act of navigating the intricately illustrated menus to the explosive crackle of celebratory fireworks that follow a large swing in points, the look and feel of this game wraps the user in. The intricate and cozy detail on every one of the hundreds of unque buildings, the chest vibrating thump when a building is placed, the thumbnail art for each of the characters' skills all ooze charm. The game makes the player feel like a welcome guest.\n\nThe campaign perpetuates this welcoming atmosphere with well written and surprisingly well voiced cast of characters who, like good sitcom personalities, begin to feel like friends of the player. The banter between characters feels natural and spirited, and the comfortable progression of the missions introduces the player to a series of complex gameplay elements with casual charm.\n\nThe gameplay itself is extremely nuanced, especially because the same set of cards are used in a few very different gameplay modes. Concrete Jungle lives up to its promise of a city-building deck builder, challenging the player to plan their city by collecting points and thinking many moves ahead in solo mode, or by uplifting their own residents and punishing their enemys' in verses mode. The design of the game does strain a bit to balance the cards between these two very different modes, but both prove very entertaining, and both provide very different challenges. In both modes, however, planning ahead is a necessity, and tactics must be layered into strategies that stretch multiple turns into the future. The many different characters and huge variety of buildings available allow for a high level of replayability of a hugely entertaining game.\n\nConcrete Jungle is a modern classic. It bucks every current trend in indie game development and delivers an beautiful experience that will certainly inspire future efforts. Pass it by at your peril!","October 3, 2015","true","11.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Concrete Jungle probably pulls more from modern board games, being an amalgation of area control and deck building, but it's execution is something that could only function in a video game medium.\n\nIt's a very ambitious game with a lot of subsystems running, and if this game were able to become a physical product, I have no doubt that it would win accolades among the board gaming community. A clever fusion of hand management, deck building, area control with a tech system!\n\nI wish the documentation of the rules was listed somewhere within the game. While I understand video games like to keep a lot of mechanics under the hood, anything that resembles a board game like this should aspire to having the entirety of it's internal rules available. The exact bonuses that blocks give is vague, and playing with rural tiles makes me wish I had a mouseover to display the maximum block total. Finally, I would adore being able to view what a placed building is, just for the sake of clarity.\n\nConcrete Jungle is an excellent entry, and I would hate for this gem to be lost in the flood of games on steam.

The level progress is very railroaded.\nLevels aside, the game in itself is fun and challenging. Completing levels is easy, but getting a high score takes planning. The different tech trees adds replayability, and offers an alternative if you get stuck on a level in the campaign.

But for fans of puzzle and strategy games, Concrete Jungle hits the right spot. It's hard to describe this game accurately so I will state that it lives up to what it says on the box: city building meets deck building meets puzzle game (I think that about covers it!)\n\nGameplay: You build a city with cards that represent various buildings. Each building has its own expense and economy costs (city building mechanics). The cards are shuffled randomly but you can make purchases to customie your deck and there is also a 'tech tree' of skills, unique to each character in the game (deck building/card game). The puzzle aspect comes in because you need to score a given number of points per column (each column has just 6 tiles in which you can place buildings, essentially how much you can score is limited by available land/tiles) to clear it and move forward.\n\nThis game is very well thought out and has immense depth. The campaign mode is exhaustive and helps with the sort of steep learning curve. In vs mode, it can get quite challenging and tense but in solo, this can be a very relaxing game! it's great for playing with friends, family on local co-op and since it works with controller you can play it on your TV (which is what I do, it's awesome).\n\nWell worth the asking price and the dev has already promised a free update with nigth mode and more pretty buildings!

Some of the powerful cards are really fun to play as they have a wide range of gamebreaking (in a good way) effects. Stealing points, inverting tiles or dumping a negative house into an enemies winning rows is lots of fun.\n\nCampaign took me a solid 16 hours (including being really stupid) and is well worth the price.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/evanbgood/recommended/400160/","evanbgood","SketchyGalore","http://steamcommunity.com/id/evanbgood/","843 products in account","Concrete Jungle is an interesting idea with an excelent execution. When I first heard about it during development, I thought it sounded neat, but it needed a strong backbone of game mechanics and plenty of depth. Fortunately, it exceeded my expectations on both fronts!\n\nFirst things first, CJ is a PUZZLE game and a deckbuilding card game. This immediately reminded me of one of my favorite under-rated games of all time, Reus: a game that on the surface seemed like a city builder/god game, yet in truth is an excellent positional puzzle game. Mechanically they're very different, but people were put off by the "bait and switch" feeling of Reus and its apparent gameplay, so I fear the same might happen to CJ. It's best to think of "city-builder" as the THEME of this game, not the genre.\n\nThe gameplay could be divided into two different games, a "solitare" style solo mode where you try to get high scores by clearing large combos of high-value city tiles, and a versus mode where you play against an AI opponent for control of the board. Both are VERY different tactically, so much so that I'm amazed they both work with the same cards and rules (other than a few special abilities here and there). But, the more I play both modes and figure out new tricks, the more I love them both. Solo is a calmer test of skill, planning, and maximization, while versus is a cut-throat match of point-stealing and trickery on par with the best board games I've ever played.\n\nThe game's campaign is a pretty good tutorial as well as a good framework for some interesting scenarios, and serves as a means to unlock more cards and characters. The voice acting is campy and a bit hit-and-miss in places, but definitely fits the tone of the game well, and made me genuinely laugh a few times. I haven't finished it yet (feels like I'm about halfway through, unlock-wise), but it seems long enough to justify the price of the game, even without diving into custom games.\n\nThere are a few flaws with the game, little UI features I wish were there and such, but most of the issues lie with versus mode. Though I like versus mode a lot, it does mess a bit with the asthetic of the game, since your solo games tend to make rather pretty cities with thought-out blocks of sensibly placed buildings, while versus games often end up being a jumble of various buildings that are placed to make the city worse for your opponent (amusingly, the campaign pokes fun at screwing up the city like this for competition). Additionally, while I found the AI putting up a pretty good challenge, it started showing some rough edges and questionable choices in the campaign. It might get smarter later on, but I've definitely seen it blow a few major and obvious opportunities. Which brings me to its biggest flaw: multiplayer. Unfortunately at this time, the game only features local hotseat multiplayer. I usually don't mind if a game has no online functionality like this, but this sort of cut-throat card game BEGS for good competition. I do think it would have been worse if they put a half-hearted attempt at multiplayer in there (a game like this would need a really good structure to make sure the game flowed, stopped leavers, etc), but hopefully the game is successful enough for them to consider adding it after the fact. It could be huge.\n\nOverall, I'm extremely happy I picked up this game. I love card games, deck builders, puzzle games, and city builders, so it was an obvious purchase for me. The idea was good enough on its own, but the depth of tactics and the hundreds of cards to discover really made it into something special. I'd recommend it to anyone who likes non-collectable card games (such as Dominion) or clever placement puzzle board games (such as Small World). Those looking for a straight city-builder should probably steer clear.\n\nPros:\n+ Solid mechanics, easy to learn and understand but with plenty of depth\n+ Very different tactics between versus and solo mode\n+ Hundreds of cards with isometric city building art for every single one\n+ Multiple characters with different special abilities and playstyles, each feel very unique\n+ Fun to look at city builder-esque asthetic\n+ Good sense of humor\n\nCons:\n- Lack of online multiplayer\n- Doesn't offer the freedom of creativity and design of a true city builder (which some people might expect when looking at it), particularly in versus mode","September 25, 2015","true","22.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/deranged101/recommended/400160/","deranged101","Deranged 101","http://steamcommunity.com/id/deranged101/","243 products in account","Concrete Jungle is a card-based puzzle game where the goal is to have the most amount of points after completing a determined number of city blocks, or "columns".  Don't let the game's graphics or screenshots fool you, though - there is a lot of depth behind this game which will keep you busy for hours on end.  After logging over 40 hours (only 11 post-release, a little over a day's worth of time during the game's beta), I can definitely recommend this incredibly fun game.   Why?  Read on...\n\nNote: I am one of the Kickstarter backers of this game, and helped beta-test it as a result of the early-access.  This review, however, is solely focused on the Steam release and not any experiences from the beta.\n\nGRAPHICSEvery building in the game has a lot of detail that could be easy to miss at first glance.  The art style is consistant throughout the game, from the urban metropolis to the rolling farmlands.  When cards with the same color group are placed side-by-side, they create larger city blocks that, depending on the angle placed, will have different visuals - this is really apparent with parks and smaller houses.  Little vehicles whiz by on the streets surrounding buildings while elevated trains can be seen rolling by in the mid-late game (when placing Train Stations).  It even rains on occasion, with condensation forming at the top and bottom of the screen as rain begins to fall and everything darkens slightly - a feature that oddly feels right.  Various world landmarks are represented in-game as well, from the Empire State Building to the Sydney Opera House.\n\nI lot of care and love went into the graphics, and it shows.\n\nMUSIC & SOUNDAll the music in the game is very relaxing - quite fitting for a game like this where you aren't forced to rush through turns.  Sound effects that you hear while playing are determined by the types of cards you have on the board - you'll hear animals and children playing when you have lots of farm and early-game residential cards in play, whereas the sounds of a bustling city (sirens, construction, honking horns, cash registers) are heard when many industrial and commerical cards are out.\n\nThere are many audio cues throughout the game as well, based on the actions of yourself and others while playing.  For example, if you clear a row and earn more than 20 points as a result, fireworks pop in the sky over the cleared buildings.  And, of course, the sound of reshuffling cards when you've exhausted your deck is one sound you'll hear often!\n\nLastly, the voice-acting is surprisingly good!  The campaign dialogue that you hear between characters can be amusing at times, and cheesy during others, but at no point did I feel the dialogue was forced by anyone.  Love every bit of it!\n\nGAMEPLAY & REPLAYABILITYFunctionally, the card graphics themselves are to-the-point and leave little guesswork as to what the cards do - once you learn what the different colors and icons mean.  You know, at a glance, when something is bad or good for you on the board based on colors used and shading applied to the spaces.  That said, the in-game tutorial, which spans the first few campaign levels, covers all core aspects of the game, so by the time you have your first versus campaign level you're given all the details and tools needed to succeed.\n\nThat said... the campaign really ramps up the difficulty curve pretty fast, which can catch most players off-guard, giving the impression that the game can be unforgiving.  Honestly... the challenge really comes from the somewhat scripted Campaign levels (some levels have pre-placed buildings, making things quite hard at times), but mostly from Versus games, where you face off against another character (or against two, in 2v2 mode).  Every selectable character in the game - there are eight in all - have a specific focus in terms of how they're meant to be played, and have several special abilities to synergize with said gameplay.  Where things get interesting is how these characters match up in Versus mode; though each character has been play-tested scores (probably hundreds) of times over, there are some situations where one character gameplay preference can absolutely dominate another.  Like any card game, this is because of good old RNG, which combined with your character's abilities, can result in either really easy wins, or incredibly harsh losses.\n\nOf course, the more cards you unlock, the greater the chances of your winning more often than not - and there are a lot of cards to unlock as you progress through the game.  Every match played, whether Solo or Versus, win or lose, will net you experience points.  When you gain a level, you unlock a new card for your starter deck.  In addition, you unlock a small number of cards for each character unlocked, though these cards are only accessible as you play a game (they cannot be added to your starting deck).\n\nWhen you take all of this into account, there is a fair amount of replayability in the game.  The number of cards available make for interesting and complex strategies, which are only reinforced by the character abilities. Between unlocking cards and characters, versus mode, and simply aiming to see each card in play at least once (some of them look amazing), you'll be coming back for more!\n\nCONCLUSIONConcrete Jungle has a lot going for it, especially for the puzzle gamer in you.  It's not a city-building game - it's really more of the game's theme than anything else - but you still get the satisfaction of seeing your city evolve as you play.  How this combination continues to work, I'm not sure... but I'm enjoying the results!  If you're into strategy or puzzle games, or into deck-building, purchase this unique gem, because you honestly won't find anything else like it.","September 26, 2015","true","28.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Important to note that even though City Building is the **theme**, the gameplay is much more about clever use of strategy, planning and card synergy. If you expect anything like Sim City you'll be heavily disappointed - but once you start appreciating the game for its uniqueness and strengths you'll be even more happy about discovering it.\n\nCard Diversity is awesome, though it does feel a bit limiting at times to start with mostly the same cards all the time. Some of the powerful cards are really fun to play as they have a wide range of gamebreaking (in a good way) effects. Stealing points, inverting tiles or dumping a negative house into an enemies winning rows is lots of fun.\n\nCampaign took me a solid 16 hours (including being really stupid) and is well worth the price. There are additional modes, but I'm really looking forward to DLC with more missions.\n\nDeveloper is also good at keeping track of and fixing bugs in a timely manner.","October 27, 2015","true","16.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Instead of simply filling rows to clear them and get points, you have to collect points by raising the property value of certain squares and then placing down a "point collecting building" (typically houses, hotels, dorms, etc) to raise the point value of the row above a certain threshold.    Some buildings instead lower the property value, but give you other bonuses such as boosting your economy.   As your economy increases you gain access to new abilities (specific to each of the several characters you can unlock) and new buildings with more powerful effects for your deck.\n\nBut as you spend more money the point threshold for clearing a line increases and the game gets more difficult, which is great because with all the new tech you have by the end of a match, the game would become trivially easy otherwise.\n\nThere are also versus matches, which feel like a completely different game and are no less compelling.  The depth of the game really shines in these matches, and the AI is no pushover.  The different characters go about building their city and scoring points in completely different ways, and the "city planning fights" are surprisingly diverse as a result.   There's even a character who prefers to dump industrial buildings everywhere and make scoring points difficult for the other player, while herself benefitting from the negative point values in various ways.   She's fun.\n\nOverall this game is fantastic and the amount of fun I had with it surprised me.  Definitely worth a buy if you have even a passing interest in puzzle games (or even city builders - though this isn't really a city builder at all, the theme and mechanics are strong enough that you'll feel like you're making tough city planning decisions throughout the game).  There's a lot of great content here and I can't recommend this game enough.","January 10","true","18.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/grimfate/recommended/400160/","grimfate","grimfate","http://steamcommunity.com/id/grimfate/","2232 products in account","Concrete Jungle is sort of a mini-city building game. Each map consists of a small segment of land, where the goal is to play buildings - represented as cards and randomly drawn from a deck - on tiles to try and either score a specific amount of points on a row of tiles, or to fill the row of tile, until you reach a certain distance. Along the way you will score points which will allow you to unlock cards for that match only, or use certain powers, such as clearing the first row of tiles. You really have to play it or watch it to fully grasp exactly how it works.\n\nThe game is mostly good. The art style is really nice, the game is relatively easy to learn, and it's quite unique (from what I have personally played, anyway.) For me, wanting to play it as a single player game, there is one huge issue that makes the campaign very frustrating: Versus matches against the A.I. The thing I really enjoy about this game is its strategy. You have all the information you need to consider your next move at each point in time - including the next few cards you will have to choose from - and so careful thinking can get you through. But Versus is different. Any kind of plan you might devise is now at the mercy of the A.I., with only a small section of the map that the A.I. can't affect. And unless you remember to pay attention during their turn to which cards they have coming up, you won't know what to expect.\n\nTo make matters worse, so far (I have completed 10 of the 11 missions I have unlocked so far, which looks like it MIGHT be around half way through the campaign) you tend to only have 1 mission available to you at a time. Stuck on a mission? Either unenthusiastically keep at it until you finally get past it, or give up and come back when you've forgotten the frustration. The current mission I'm on took me what felt like half an hour to complete, which I failed, so my enthusiasm to potentitally waste that much time again is rather low. What makes it much worse is that even at the fastest A.I. speed (called "Turbo"), the A.I. is still frustratingly slow. Its turns can take what feels like 15 seconds, which may not sound long, but it does feel long watching animations you wish it would just skip, and that half an hour length will involve a few minutes of waiting through the A.I.'s turn.\n\nThe game is fun (outside of Versus), and I'm sure there will be plenty of people who will love the challenge. And so I do recommend Concrete Jungle; just be warned that if you don't like intense thinking with your games, this game may fail to satisfy your game playing needs.","February 7","true","12.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
