It took me about 4 hours to play on advanced, using at most one hint per scene.\n\nAs a hidden object game, it is mediocre, with the genre's all too common collage of objects not constrained by scale, gravity, or even common sense. Vault cracking is very minor: you get 5 simple logic puzzles in all. The most intersting part of the game are the 5 minigames where you eliminate people from a picture based on given criteria such as "is eating" or "wears sandals" until only one is left. You also get 5 chances to dress your heroine up with hair, makeup, shirt, slacks or skirt, and shoes. The major part of your time is spent looking for hidden objects. Plot and voice acting are forgettable.\n\nThe game has 5 chapters; best to save when a chapter ends or begins, as otherwise there might be bugs, check the forum.\n\nI'm a general gamer, not a hidden object fan, and I have played quite a few hidden object games that were better than this, such as ClockWork Tales: Of Glass and Ink, Paranormal State: Poison Springs or Isabella. There is no reason to buy this game, unless you have run out of other Hidden Object games to play and this one's on sale.","November 4, 2014","false","4.2"," 31 of 34 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","31","34","0","1"

It is also devoid of all supernatural elements– something that is almost never seen in modern hidden object games.\n\nOn the other hand this 2010 product feels like something created at the earliest days of the hidden object genre. The resolution is locked at 800×600. The image quality is horrible with JPEG compression noise everywhere. There is no puzzle variety, just HOPs, which also reminds us of the ancient HO games. And I still don’t quite understand what purpose did the character dress-up sequences serve.\n\nStill, if you don’t mind the outdated mechanics and visuals, and the short length, then play it for the story, it will be worth it.","November 22, 2014","true","3.7"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","13","15","0","0"

This is almost purely a hidden object game where you click on various objects on your check list for no reason at all. Either way, there isn't much of an "adventure" aspect except in following along with the plot and mission objectives. These seem to involve you fixing various objects like some kind of repairman and picking out a dozen or so particular objects from a room before throwing away all but 1 of them.","November 22, 2014","false","0.6"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Nothing really amazing, but what it did, it did well. Good HOG with well drawn environments. The voice acting was a nice surprise and pacing was handled well. Short but organized, each story piece was fleshed out and logical. Overall an easy 3 hours blown and considering it goes on sale fairly often it's a worthwhile grab for fans of the genre.\nAs a sidenote I liked the chapter interludes where you got to choose the player character's gear and look, nice addition into the HOG framework.
