The economic gameplay in the game is solid, it is less about buildings than for example Rome total war 1, however there are various other things that have an influence on the economy such the governors of the province that you can select (very much like Rome total war 1) but also stuff like the people you have chosen to take positions in nationwide politics, the laws you have passed, religious blessings, trade and the kind of civ you have( for example dictatorship monarchy and various kinds of democracies).\nThat brings me to something else that works pretty well in this game, Politics. The game has 5 political factions that battle (sometimes in case of civil war literally) over political control of your nation. Each factions power can grow or diminish depending on your actions, the populist party will for example gain more political attraction if either peace or war last too long, while the religious faction can grow from invoking blessings on your nation or sacrificing to the gods, but all factions grow from having representatives in important functions for (for example the research positions) the people taking these functions are chosen by you. But on the other side the factions can also influence your decisions, if you don't have the political support in the senate you can't start wars or make use of various other mechanics in the diplomacy interface.\n\nWhat doesn't work?\n\nThe game doesn't do such a good job of explaining to you what various mechanics in the game do and how they are calculated (I for example still don't know fully how diplomatic skill is calculated) most of it however isn't that annoying and can in a way even increase your enjoyment, since you get the feeling that after your first playthrough you really got to know the game, therefore also giving you an incentive to try another one. It also isn't that bad, now after some wiki reading I think diplomatic skill is the only thing I do not really understand that I would like to understand. The game could however do a better job of presenting its information, the game could for example tell you what the traits characters could gain during events do before you need to selects them. Also I think the game could have been better if the people of your nation belonged to larger but fewer families and give you a better way (for example the family tree in Rome total war 1) to look at these families and their relations to other people in your nation\n\nIn the end I sill liked this game very much but it could have been better","December 1, 2013","true","108.5"," 84 of 88 people (95%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","95","84","88","3","0"

That means that I've played Hearts of Iron III a few years ago (and enjoyed a Communist Greece, amongst my other "achievements") and also love Europa Universalis IV. I saw EU: Rome on Steam and, basically, bought it to give it a try.\n\nCONS\n1) For a 2008 Game, Graphics should've been better.\n2) Not the variety of factions that HoI3 or EUIV have.\n3) Steam version forces you to search for the manual here. Also, the tutorial could've been better.\n4) Surely, not as worth as EUIV but I'd love to try something until HoI4 goes public.\n5) There are no mods is Steam for this game. Maybe the CD version (regular installation) supports them, but I couldn't find anything here.\n\nPROS\n1) Cheap. 10 euros for a Grand Strategy Game by Paradox. It's God's will!\n2) The "Vae Victis" expansion and all patches are included.\n3) Historical accuracy and interesting gameplay. It starts with the Invasion of Pyrrhus in Italy and the wars between Romans and Greeks.\n4) Variety of historical starts. From an early Roman Republic to the Civil Wars and the foundation of the Roman Empire. Yeah!\n5) Awesome music. That may sound stupid, but have a look at YouTube... Yeah, you're welcome.\n6) Don't know if it's the way the AI works, but a huge advantage of the game is that factions like Rome, Carthage, Seleucids, Egypt, Macedon and Pontus actually grow up. So, a player gets to experience the "anxiety" of fighting Rome in Magna Graecia or Carthage in Africa. If you're a TWR2 player, you'll see a huge difference. Factions like the Illyrians don't consume Empires in no time, like in Rome 2. You hear that CA?\n\nI don't guarantee that it'll be an unforgetable experience, but it's a nice, fun game to play, balanced enough for its kind.\nHave fun!

For example, you can choose a emmissary to send to an enemy country to declare war on them, which is good to eliminate bad apples in the family because they are usually killed the the enmy country. But unlike in EU3 and EU4, you can't have cabinet members that give your country bonuses ( trade does that, but it's not as interesting). But I do like this more than the other games because:\n\n1. It's a longer game than EU3. I don't know about EU4 because I haven't ever played it.\n\n2. The time setting is much more interesting to me than EU3 and EU4.\n\n3. Altough this game looses some features, it also gains ones. For example, the troops in your army can become more loyal to their general than their country. This means if that general has loyal units and decides to start a civil war, you have a problem. But it is not all bad, because the generals pay their troops instead of you so you get more money.\n\nOverall, It is a great game and should be bought by Europa Universalis fans. 8/10","April 15, 2014","true","23.6"," 29 of 37 people (78%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","78","29","37","5","0"

The rotateable/tiltable map is the best map Paradox have ever done in any of their games I dont know why they havent do it since. And the mechanics in this game are amazing - its all in here. And the colours are lovely and bright unlike some of their later games (HOI3 I mean you). Ok the city view is rope, the sprites are not great by modern standards, some of the faces look a bit daft, but the fact there are family characters in this game, like appeared in CK2, makes it very interesting. I would probably have to say overall this game is second only to Crusader Kings 2 in terms of immersion. I so prefer Victoria 2's time period mind. But unlike Viictoria 2 the whole world is up for grabs in this game, much like in CK2. You are spoiled for choice in terms of expansion possibiltiies.\n\nDefinitely recommended if you can get past the rather dated graphics, although these still stand up quite well thanks to the lovely map and superb interface.","January 26, 2015","true","22.4"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","87","13","15","2","6"

Unfortunately this is not a marriage made in heaven and the two styles does not mix well in this game.\n\nRome is a grand strategy game, you pick your nation among those that were around at whatever start date you chose and then go about doing what ever you please. War, trade, diplomacy, like in other Paradox grand strategy games you can play your country however you please but the game is still geared heavily in the favor of warfare. You will simply gain more and gain it faster by taking it from others.\n\nIntroduced in this game is a myriad of characters that rule your cities and lead your armies all with their own traits, preferences and family relations. Unlike in Crusader Kings you don't have your own family tree in this game but instead simply try to manage your various powerful subjects in this manner. Although this is a great idea in principle it is fairly poorly executed. Managing the many, many characters available to you is a huge task that only grows larger as the game goes on and if you chose to ignore the micromanagement for too long you might have a revolt on your hands.\n\nRome is a game that brings a lot of cool aspects together from two very great game but it is also a game that has a lot of issues with implementation and execution that makes it a chore to play at times. It is still a Paradox grand strategy and that means there is quality underneath it all but it is still the weakest one in their lineup.","January 4, 2013","false","194.1"," 24 of 40 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","24","40","0","7"

If you play a nation that borders to them, it makes the game very "fun" and unpredictible.\nAlso, you can have children and start very long dynasties. Its fun to watch.\n\nCombat is very much EU-like and simple. A good general is the most important thing.\nThere is lots to know about the game, you can read on it for a very long time to understand everything indeph.\nCasus belli, how to play wars, the differences of the political systems and how they work, diplomacy, techtrees, jadda jadda.\n\nI enjoyed this good micro/macro strategy for a very long time.\nIts really hard to beat it with something like a little gallic state that battles the roman empire.\nBut if you make it, it was an experience thats worth it. If not, you want to try again. ;)\n\nThe only bad thing i have to say about the game, is that it has a nasty bug with soldier loyalty.\nIt randomly applies it to characters that never led an army.\nBut this bug is so nasty, it really dampens the experience.\nYou can play around it, but it simply sux a-s-s, and its a shame Paradox never fixed it, because this is one of their very best games.","February 24","true","527.6"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

It is a game that could have been quite good, but was ultimately left by the wayside as its developer moved on to more significant projects.\n\nIf you look at the developer's history of releases, you'll find that that it very often intersperses minor, derivative releases between its major titles. These titles are almost without exception unpolished and unimpressive, and EU: Rome fits that bill perfectly. You'll find that the gameplay is very similar to that of EU3, with necessary variations that were poorly implemented. Even the expansion pack, Vae Victis, was not enough to salvage this game, and neither were the relatively few major mods released for it. It's a shame, really, as the Roman era was an interesting time, and the foundations of this game were relatively well-conceived; had it received the necessary attention, it could have been a very entertaining title.\n\nWhile it may look attractive---it appears, to the casual eye, as EU3 in the Roman period---this game  just isn't very good.","July 15, 2013","false","5.1"," 22 of 41 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","22","41","0","0"

But this like the aforementioned titles is very good.\n\nThe game starts around 470 AD to about 700AD and the map is of the known world around the time of Caesar. The characters, political desires and backstabbing is brilliant. It is a dramatic theatre overlayed with a nation building game. Treat your Generals and politicians well and they will look after you, if you appease the Populists too much your nation will suffer!\n\nIt's not as easy as EUIII nor even HoI for that matter.

It sits at a crossroads between the nation-management of Europa Universalis, and the character management of Crusader Kings.\n\nHowever, these little bits of good do not outweigh the basic fact that the gameplay is clunky and unintuitive when compared to other (both newer and older) paradox titles.\n\nBasically, if you have played any other Paradox grand strategy games, the mechanics are all the same, but all more cumbersome to carry out in their own way.","January 10, 2014","false","2.2"," 12 of 29 people (41%) found this review helpful","41","12","29","0","0"

You can have children, friends and rivals! Some of your leaders are completely useless just like in real life! Internal political bickering from time to time is fun.\n\nThe bad:\n- The game doesn't even work after you install it via steam. You have to fetch the latest beta patch 2.36C from the Paradox forums to make it work (hassle)\n- Research seems to take forever. So you got nothing to build most of the time (i tried only the earliest campaign. Maybe you have already unlocked research in the later ones). Still its far too slow compared to EU4. Also the 5 leaders you assign to research don't seem to change anything at all.\n- The concept of claiming a territory is still present in this game, except you cannot claim new territories like in EU4. This concept is that when you invade a territory, you cannot annex it and add it to your empire unless you have (or forged) a claim on it. Most of my diplomats time were spent doing that in EU4. In this game, it seems you can't annex a territory unless you conquer the whole ennemy territories. That's pretty bad! Some of the ennemy has 15 or more territories and becomes an almost impossible task to do!\n- You can colonise unclaimed territories from barbarians, but not if the strength of the barbarians is too high! So you need to wait forever for them to do an uprising and crush it to lower their strength and then colonise (Never happened after years(in game) of play). That is a very bad concept right there.\n- For some reason, a 2 territory empire can witstand the mighty rome empire consisting of 8 territories plus the super lucrative Rome territory(which is equalt to 4-5 territories on its own)! I swear the freakin...g Epirus had an army of 20 troops when i could barely foot 36 troops in the field. They also had an 11 trireme navy! And they managed to attack me 2-3 times with 11 troops? WTF! How could they make that much money to support their troops? How could they even build that many troops in the first place? You can only build one troop at a time on one territory and it takes 90 days for the cheapest troops, the other takes longer if you have the ressources for it. The guy had horses which even rome didn't have for god sake and elephants!!!\n- The game feel pretty flat compared to EU4. I don't know it's like its empty somehow.\n\nNow i didn't play the xpansion vae victus. Not sure i will play either.\n\nVerdict: Don't waste your money on this game. Play the much better Europa Universalis 4 which this game is based on.\nOr go play Distant Worlds, a faaaaaaaar better game than EU4 in my experience as a strategy game and its in spaaaaaace!","June 21, 2015","false","3.6"," 1 of 8 people (13%) found this review helpful","13","1","8","0","0"

This is an under appreciated game, a pre-cursor to Crusader Kings 2. Sort of a strange hybrid of EU and CK. My biggest criticism is the colonization system that leaves much of the map without any major factions at start, thus making the game play almost exclusively a battle of ancient superpowers. Another issue is the micromangement is a little too heavy. I enjoy it for the most part, but it becomes tiresome after awhile.","May 20, 2015","true","124.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Released in 2008, the game is what would be considered a "budget game", basically a side project to vary from the big projects they were working on.\n\nBut just because this is a budget game doesn't mean it's not good!!\n\nYou can play as any major (and some minor) faction ranging from 280 BC to 33 BC, and guide the nation through all aspects like religion, politics, economy, military, etc... It has a small learning curve but by the time you learn you will be HOOKED!!\n\nSure the graphics are outdated, but what self respecting PC strategy gamer cares about graphics?? The gameplay is a wonderful blend of high level empire management made famous by the main Europa Universalis series, and the character system of Crusader Kings II. It's an overall great game that still gets attention (PDS is the greatest game company ever, and they have a wonderful practice where they go back and update their old games out of nowhere!).\n\nSo buy this game (2.49 USD on sale, so why the hell not!!) and lose yourself in the world of Rome and it's politics!!\n\nSi vis pacem, para bellum","January 1","true","8.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
