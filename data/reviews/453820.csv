Combined with the fact that at this level enemy releases ~10 heroes to every one of yours and it stops being difficult and just hits impossible. Requested refund and advise everyone to avoid game like the plague I absolutely expected it to be when I saw that it was a "we took a free flash game and put it on steam for money" game.","April 13","false","0.3"," 40 of 48 people (83%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","83","40","48","5","6"

If one side gets the upper hand, it can battle through to the enemy castle and destroy it. You have four different units, two melee and two ranged. You have a cooldown for creating units; every time you create one, the cooldown for all units is reset. More powerful units have longer cooldown, so you can either push out cheap units quickly or stronger units a bit slower. You also have several spells to aid you; like the units, whenever you cast a spell the cooldown for all spells resets. After each stage, you earn some points that you can use to upgrade your units and spells.\n\nUnfortunately, the execution is terrible. On the technical side, I encountered two glitches where I could no longer click anything in just half an hour of play. It also doesn't have any hotkeys, which would be immensely helpful in a game where reaction speed is everything.\nOn the game play side, a few stages into the game it gets heavily stacked against you. The AI is not restricted to the same cooldowns that you are and will push out five times the number of units you do. they will kill your units so fast that you won't have more than one or two units on the field at the same time, and those will quickly be killed by the enemies units and spells. Theoretically, you're supposed to get a good mix of the four unit types to counter the enemy, but since you can't keep enough units on the field to actually stem the tide, the whole idea of a mix goes right out the window. You'll try to rush out as many of the cheapest unit you can only to watch them being mowed down, even at the highest upgrade you can afford.\nAlternately, you can upgrade the spells to be powerful enough to kill the enemy units. However, they will then hit several units at once (three at maximum level); and if you don't have three targets, you can't cast that spell, even if you'd need it. Also, since your units won't have any upgrades then, they won't survive the enemy spells and the best you'll achieve is a standstill until the enemy pushes out more units at once than your spells can kill in one go.\n\nI wanted to like the game but it feels like a mobile game that requires micro-transactions to win with all the micro-transactions cut out. Therefore I cannot recommend it even at the low price it is.","April 13","false","2.7"," 29 of 34 people (85%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","85","29","34","6","2"

When I read reviews and people said it got to hard I assumed it was like Kingdom Rush. Where it becomes harder but still possible. But no... Before even having all the content unlocked I was stuck. I was stuck on level 3. The enemy spams troops faster than you. And they have troop types you don't even have yet. They spam the fire magic just to rain down letting your troops get slaughtered. While they rush your castle. So I thought, "Oh... I guess I might need to grind on older levels? I mean Epic War 4 and 5 you have to do that but I still love those games and I would get a steam game of it if they had one. But no. I completed an older level and was rewarded with NOTHING. No gold. No blue... things?... expirence points? So pretty much they want me to get really lucky against the level three, the first tutorial level to magic! I don't normally refund games especially cheap ones like this. But this game is so horrible I don't want it in my library. I don't want to look at it. I don't think I'll have any occasional fun with it. Honestly you guys would be better off throwing 100 pennies in a fountain and get more fun and time then you would at this game. It is really that bad.","April 19","false","0.2"," 23 of 26 people (88%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","88","23","26","3","0"

Actual snippet from the store description. I can... I can hardly bring myself to write... an actual review for this. Stendarr forgive me.\n\nIf you've played the ancient "Age of War" Flash game, you've played this. Hit the assorted troop and 'magic' buttons endlessly as you wait for cooldowns to complete and keep diligent and patient as you spam troops to victory. This Flash game actually boots up in Adoble Flash Player 11. There's nothing else to say about this game, other than being able to use the keyboard for troops and magic would be much more efficient and easy than rolling the mouse cursor everywhere. And that sometimes the magic abilities lock up and won't register your clicks even though they're clearly ready to use. And that completely messes up your flow and you lose the round. And you could just get the game in a decent state for free as a Flash game without gunking up your hard disk. And... and...QWREPN WQEFPNWQ @!#ER@F J@F(J!#DF)(qA 2310re9hjn 1-9@ FJOK we1 4! WF@Ef23q54w-=o\n\nIn short, don't you dare spend money on this game if you value your life and/or money. You don't even have to cherish both. Just one or the other is reason enough to not spend on this. Just... just turn back now!","April 13","false","4.0"," 17 of 22 people (77%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","77","17","22","5","0"

Basically what you do is press buttons that spawn warriors that protect your castle while attacking the enemy castle on the opposite side and you also have spells that damage the enemy however the buttons take time before you can press them again and the enemies are coming at you the whole time and they also have spells that kill your troops pretty much as soon as they're spawned, no matter how hard you try it's almost impossible to hold them off and there's nothing you can really do to make it easier other than upgrades that don't seem to do anything since each level increases dramatically in difficulty anyway. I would have really enjoyed this game if it weren't so impossible.","April 23","false","2.5"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"
