Unfortunately due to Steam's binary review system, I can only recommend it, or not recommend it, and so I'm going with the latter.\nFirst off, the unlock system was poorly designed. It has both progressive gameplay features, such as turrets and other items, and also cosmetic items such as backgrounds and costumes. You are given tokens to unlock the gameplay items/features, but they're pretty pointless because you have to unlock all of the features/items in its tier (maximum of three) before unlocking the next set of items. It's like skill trees from RPGs, only there's just one of them, and you don't have a choice. The cosmetic items on the other hand, are a nice touch but they're randomized so you can't actually choose them.\nThe gameplay is interesting, and is definitely different, however it just feels really poorly thought out and broken. The difficulty is just a side effect of the poorly designed concept; it's stuck in this limbo of tower defense and platformer but doesn't do either very well. This is especially apparent in the later levels, when it just becomes a big spamfest of items and the platforming and tower defense elements are all but gone.\n\nI only really wanted to outline the bad things about the game, there are definitely positives to it but I just feel the negatives outweigh them too much.","May 3, 2014","false","9.8"," 42 of 56 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","42","56","0","1"

You play as a dog protecting a cat from enemies that come through doors and move around the stage towards the cat you have tied up. The stage layout is the same but you can unlock different skins for it.\n\nYou defeat the enemies by jumping on them or collecting power ups scattered around the stage. Many of these will also need to be unlocked through completing challenges. Every 3 challenges you complete you get one unlock point. You can get a flaming knife that will fly in a straight line killing any enemy it hits. An electrical tower you can place that will shock your enemy when it gets close by. A few other items will help you too like ice to freeze or hearts for health and they can also be turned into poop to slow the enemy.\n\nChallenges do become pretty tough and the bad thing is you only get 3 at a time and need to do all three before getting new ones. So progress can become slow on unlocking everything in the game. There is no story just a short quick game you can pop on and play for five minutes or 5 hours if you like. It is fun to play and for the low price it's at you'll definitely get your money from it.\n\nBear Pros:\nFun and cute platforming RTS\nLots of unlockables\nChallenging missions\n\nBear Cons:\nMay be to challenging early on for some\nOnly one map to play on\nNo new challenges until all three are complete","May 9, 2014","true","1.4"," 22 of 28 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","22","28","0","1"

It nicely mixes the arcade Super Mario Bros. with elements on tower defense to make a fun and challenging experience. With the progressions system you will be able to keep playing and advance, unlocking new items, moves, and room pieces. Definitely 4 - 6 hours worth of gameplay. There are a lot of issues in general, some odd bugs and the complete lack of customization (no rebindable keys is a pain and so is no resolution options).  There are no extra maps. If you get too bored of the current one then that's too bad. It's a shame because a few extra maps can really make the gameplay and strategy vary in a positive way. With that being said, Poof does what it aims to do, but only that. 3/5","November 8, 2013","true","8.1"," 18 of 24 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","18","24","0","0"

It's just really fun to play again and again. The premise is very simple; protect your kitty from hoards of enemies. As you complete objectives you unlock skills and pickups that add more depth to the game. It's just really well done, with the tight controls and balanced gameplay I never found myself getting mad about dying or just barely missing an objective - I just wanted to try again. The developers put a lot of love and care into this game - the graphics and characters are cute and cartoony, the pickups are all useful and fun (I like how as you pick up items they chain behind you and you can only use the first in the cue, it adds a lot of strategy), the game rewards you with neat skins for the characters and backgrounds and new music, the towers and golden poohs that slow down enemies keep things interesting, and the enemies are varied and require different strategies - it just shows that focused efforts like this can be so much more fun than big 60$ games that try to stuff in everything and appeal to everyone.","February 1, 2015","true","4.1"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","87","13","15","2","0"

I ended up playing for hours, and having a blast. Poof really is a game that I believe needs more attention. In Poof you play as a heroic little dog who's duty is to protect the cat from enemies that spawn out of doors on the side of the level. The fast paced gameplay is where I believe this game shines. It plays similar to Mario Bros the arcade game from 1983, but it also stirs things up by adding tower defense elements. Jumping on baddies heads will kill them, but there is also a variety of power ups to make things more interesting. Every round you have three challenges to complete and once you complete them you earn a unlock point which you can use to unlock a new power up or perk. You have to beat all three challenges to do this (no skipping challenges) and you have to unlock each power up/perk one after another. Some may dislike this as it takes some freedom away from the player, but personally I found that it kept me trying to complete the challenge.\nEach level is the exact same layout (well you eventually can expand it a bit) which is another thing that will be mildly disappointing and repetitive to some. That being said, from each match you gain exp towards unlocking new level skins, costumes, and music, a feature that I really enjoyed. The artwork has a very cartoony cute feel to it, although I wish there was a bigger variety of enemies. I played with a Pc Xbox controller, not sure how controls feel otherwise. Poof is not a mind blowing game, but definitely a game that needs some more credit than what it gets.\n(Keep in mind, this review was written when I was 4.7 hours into the game. I may change my opinions later.)\nPros:\n+ Enjoyable platforming\n+ Full controller support\n+ Cute character design and art\n+ Golden poo\n+ Variety of unlockables (powerups, skins, costumes, music..etc)\nCons:\n- Would gain from having more level layouts\n- Sometimes some of the challenges are too hard\n- Larger amount of enemies would be nice\n- Floaty controls take some getting use too","May 29, 2014","true","4.7"," 15 of 19 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","15","19","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/markdj/recommended/243280/","markdj","dj.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/markdj/","2975 products in account","Poof takes a bit of the tower defense titles and mixes it up with Mario Bros. styled gameplay (the first game with all the pipes, not the platformer). You control Poof, a dog that has to protect a cat hanging in the lower center of the level from getting attacked by all sorts of creatures. Kill enough enemies, create combos, and use your other abilities to complete objectives, score points and unlock extras, new weaponry and new abilities. The more you play, the more you'll unlock, like towers that shoot arrows or ice cubes that freeze enemies for a short while, allowing you to create even longer combos. The downside is that there's only one level. You'll unlock different backgrounds, outfits, et cetera later on to keep things a little bit interesting, though. You can even unlock an extra (still small) part of the level making things even more hectic.\n\nIt's a game that keeps challenging you. Rounds can be short but never frustrating. You'll most likely want to keep trying to beat your old score and unlock new stuff, but after about 3 hours you've probably seen most of it already, even if you haven't unlocked all of it yet. It becomes too repetitive too soon. That doesn't make it a bad game, because there's always stuff to unlock, but it needs more than just one level.\n\n[Rating: 70/100]","January 5, 2014","true","3.1"," 12 of 17 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","12","17","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/joecool4279/recommended/243280/","joecool4279","JoeCool","http://steamcommunity.com/id/joecool4279/","4975 products in account","I checked this game out after reading that it was a cross between the old Mario Brothers arcade game (pre-Super) and tower defense. That's an accurate comparison. It's primarily a tower defense game, as your principle mission is to protect a cat from being captured by the enemies. You play as a dog and can drop poop (yes, poop) to slow your enemies down. You can build turrets, create an ice storm to freeze enemies, hurl flaming daggers, etc. In a pinch? Slow down time for a bit.\n\nThere is always plenty going on all over the screen. The enemies come fast and furiously. Some fly. Some drop bombs. Some come in packs. Some move faster than others. The difficulty increases quickly and dramatically. Poof is a very challenging game. You realize that immediately when your mission goals include "survive for 30 seconds" or "survive 10 seconds in warning mode."\n\nWhat makes Poof so challenging isn't just the lightning speed increase in difficulty, but also accessibility to items. While they are plentiful, they never spawn on the ground. They spawn in the upper tiers. Navigating to these items becomes increasingly difficult as the screen fills with enemies and abandoning the ground floor leaves the cat open to attack. If you love a challenging platform/tower defense game, you're in for a treat with Poof. Personally, the game has a little too much going on everywhere for my tastes. It's overload. But I'm still enjoy trying to clear the level objectives.\n\nEach level has three objectives to complete. They range from using a certain attack a certain number of times, constructing a number of turrets, surviving a period of time, etc. Once you clear the three objectives, you clear the level and unlock a new ability. Collecting jewels unlocks collectibles like new backgrounds.\n\nI used the XBOX 360 controller for Windows with this game. It works perfectly. I think this game would be difficult to play without a controller.","January 3, 2014","true","1.4"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Twistorian/recommended/243280/","Twistorian","Twistor","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Twistorian/","4382 products in account","Poöf is basically an action defense platformer. It's also a bit crazy: in it you are, after all, a hat-enthusiast doggy with a magic kitten that poops golden eggs. Monsters want the kitten too. The curse is that you will DIE if they get the kitten so, ironically, you need to defend it with your life.\n\nBasic idea is simple. Monsters come through doors that are scattered over the level, and you must kill them before they get to the kitten. You can jump on them like Mario or kill them with special items or defensive structures that can be placed in the assigned places. Being a dog you can also poop - yes, poop - golden poop that slows down anything that passes over or through it.\n\nPlaying along, you get more items and abilities. There's just this one disappointing thing about the game: there's only one map. Granted, I do not think I spoil too much if I reveal that as you complete missions, you will eventually unlock new areas in the one map. These spawn new, usually more dangerous monster types. Also the style changes: you'll be wearing different hats and outfits, as is the kitty and the level's appearance will change randomly between games as well. It won't fool anyone, but is a nice change for the ever-repeating map.\n\nBesides the single map, the game is quite fun for a while, and it's rather cheap. If you really get into it, you can try to work your way up the global leaderboards.\n\nOne last thing: At the time of the writing, Poof's cards are quite expensive. While the recent sale has lowered their price a bit, you can still get quite a large penny back just by selling the cards. Check the market for the current situation though.\n\n(Edit: Changed part that was no longer relevant)","March 14, 2014","true","9.7"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

It's frantic and dynamic, and will have you rushing all over the stage to jump on bad guys, collect items, and place towers.  If you get an item you don't want, you can quickly convert it into a 'golden poo' as well, which will slow down any enemies that walk over it, buying you precious time.\n\nThere's lots to unlock, but there is sadly only one play area.  It's well designed, and it will be expanded through unlocks as you progress, but some more level selection would be nice.  This is the only real complaint I have with the game though: the visuals, audio, and gameplay are all top-notch.

So, 2/10 for the story.\n\nThere is also no option for the screen, full - windows mode. I have a trick, press Alt+Enter to active the game into windows mode.

Graphics are colorful, and fluid, kind of like castle crashers.   Its a 2d wave after wave of monsters.  The layout never changes, but the monster's that come out do.  Its labeled as a tower defense, but to me thats kind of a stretch.  Think the original Mario Bros game, with Nicklelodean style graphics and bathroom humor, toss in survival mode and there it is.  The caveat  though, the level ends once you complete the tasks, so it can be under a minute, or over five+.  Another thing is the way the bonuses work.  They follow you, and you have to tell it when to use it.  You can be down to one heart, have five trailing and still die, or have a different power up emerge just as use the heart and still die.  Other than that, i found myself really enjoying the title.\n\nvalue: 3-5 bucks, get it on sale or in a bundle.  7 is just a tad much\nage: 5 and up.  Any younger and it might get frustrating, and the potty humor.\nplayability: after about 1/2 hr, it gets pretty grating, but in small increments its fun\n\n7.5/10","September 13, 2014","true","2.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Simple gamplay centered around an upgrade system and meta-missions (i.e. 'survive for 1:30', 'get a combo of x10', etc).  The only differences are, It's probably the worst execution of the concept I've ever played, and I had to pay eight dollars to play it.  There's no free agency, you can only get the upgrades in a set order, you don't gather any sort of currency, you're just given three missions and when you complete the set you get an upgrade.  The gameplay itself is awful.  Shallow and clunky.  There's no real difficulty, just frustration from hits that shouldn't have happened and crap like that.  Don't get it.

This game is crazy! Insane! Honestly, if you are looking for a nice mix of platform game and tower defense game... well, there is nothing else at the market at the moment, really. The game is easy to start and hard to master. The graphics, sounds and the the mechanics are just great (for such a little game). Difficult, but also very rewarding. I would buy it once again, it is worth it.","March 17, 2014","true","39.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's so worth the $7, but if you're unsure wait for a sale then pick it up - you won't regret it.\nWhen you start it seems quite easy, but before you know it you're running everywhere for items to save your life.\nI loaded the game for the first time and once I started I could not stop. It's quick to learn, colourful and runs really well.\nWhile it didn't take too long to finish the game, once you've finished you can post scores against other players to try and be best.","April 24, 2014","true","25.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The little enemies are cute, the hero is cute and even the cursed kitty is cute.\nSometimes I find it a bit of a challenge because I'm not very good at keeping track of my health but that's not the game's issue that is my own.\nIt's simular to other games but yet completely different at the same time. It has a Mario V.S Donkey Kong feel to it, but yet it's a bit different all at once.\nI really do love this cute silly game and can play it all day.","March 13, 2014","true","3.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/drgonfire1/recommended/243280/","drgonfire1","drgonfire1","http://steamcommunity.com/id/drgonfire1/","1016 products in account","Imagine a 2D tower defense platformer with no towers (effectively), an unending supply of enemies, and a cat to protect... who is tied up and can't escape and dies isntantly. Poof, at it's heart, is a strategic platformer, with just the right amount of difficulty to make strategy disappear within seconds and reaction dominate the course of gameplay. This makes what could be a simple game change into an addictive experience. The controls, like any good platformer are simple and manageable, and the objective (keep the cat from getting killed) is easily understood and increasingly hard to do.\n\nThe Pros:\nSimple, solid, responsive controls.\nProgressive challenge system to change your gameplay style with every play\nTimeless look. Retro graphics can be good, but sometimes the more cartoon-y designs are more enjoyable to see.\nVisibly distinct enemies, allowing you to easily adapt to their strengths and weaknesses.\n\nThe Cons:\nA repetative level design. Perhaps the biggest complaint for Poof is its level design. It is one level. This makes it easy to navigate and try to develope a strategy, but it also means you are always seeing the same ledges to jump on/to which can become old to look at or play on.\n\nWhile I reccomend this game, and emphatically tell friends to have this as a quick game to play, I recommend looking at this game more like a casual game. I play poof for a few rounds at a time. Each of the quests has three challenges to it which you can complete individually. This, coupled with the very quick nature of how often you will be overrun, make the game feel better if you are trying to beat a challenge or two at a time, playing for only a half hour or so, and then leave to do other things. The repetative nature of the game means it plays best in short measures, like a game to play while waiting for something to finish processing or to waste a few minutes of time.\n\nPlay Poof for what it is: a fun, quick platformer that is a nice, casual time-waster. Don't play it hoping to find some epic story. Poof is meant to be for fun, and accessible to everyone.","March 28, 2014","true","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
