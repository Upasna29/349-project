I bought the game in July of 2014 without reading any reviews.  Boy that was stupid!  This game would be the phatest chess game since I was a kid, but the devs obviously don't care about the game or their customers.  After buying it, I was unable to complete one game without it crashing.  So despite all of the aggravated comments, I thought I'd hold my peace and wait for a patch.  So I waited, and waited, and waited, and waited, and OH the devs promised a patch.  So I waited, and waited, OH the devs had a death in the family.  I couldn't hold that against them.  So I waited, and waited, and waited, and waited, and OH an apology for the delay with another promised patch.  I can't remember what the last excuse was for the delay to that patch, but I waited.  Sorry for the drama, but I'm trying to get across how the purchasing of this game was a complete waste of my money.  It is now the end of January 2015, and I have played my first game since last July.  Ten minutes of gameplay with the lowest graphics settings possible (which I shouldn't have to do b/c my system is top notch) and CRASH!!

The game is very clunky and wastes a lot of time with unneeded messages. "A castle is available!" "You've completed watching all the animations for X unit!" It's very annoying.\n\n2. Bugs. Glitches. Crashes. This game is full of em'. Do you like the game crashing in roughly 50% of your games? The dev certainly does, because this game does just that.\n\n3. The dev has promised several fixes in the future. Well, at least he did A YEAR AGO. Nuff' said.\n\n4. Full 3-d animations seem pretty cool until you realize that there's only 3 animations per fight. (Pawn vs Pawn, King vs Bishop, etc.) Would be nice if more was added but that's hoping for a lot from this dev.\n\n5. Did I forget to mention that this game crashes a lot?\n\n6. Some of the animations make no sense at all. I lost all hope when the my Knight and the AI Queen got into a dancing contest.\n\n7. Sonofa... THE GAME JUST CRASHED AGAIN\n\n-9,223,372,036,854,775/10 would not play again\n\n4/25/2016 EDIT: Played a little today out of sheer curiosity to see if this game got any better...\n\n+The game runs MUCH smoother. I actually reached about mid-game this time.\n\n+Fewer glitches, thank god. I think all the maps work now. Well, mostly...\n\n-Out of the 3 games I played this session, 2 of them crashed when I moved my Rook a couple times...\n\n-That stupid "colorless glitch" is STILL HERE. What, is this glitch permanent or something?\n\n-Needless messages pop up all the time, and they waste a LOT of time. You can't skip them, either.\n\n-Animations for battles (The biggest thing about this game) are slow and more "annoying" than "cool". It'd be better if the animation was just a quick stab or brutal slash with a sword, but no it's instead a long goofy battle between two expendable soldiers...\n\nVERDICT: I think I'll wait another 2-3 years before trying this again.

My opinion is besides the multiple bugs rapant during Early Access which render the game frustrating to use. (On this side note, the game has only very recently been released, and so bugs are understandable; assuming that they'll be fixed in due time.)\n\nLet me start with thegood. The graphics are great! The silly-at-heart battle sequences, as Battle Chess has been known for, are creative and hilarious, and there were a whole lot more of them than in the previous versions which played the same single ones over and over again. The design for the skin meshes is very fancy. (My personal favorite's the Bishop.)\n\n\nAnd now, "onward" to my stark critique.\n\nI feel as if the proud traditions of Battle Chess has been spat on and  replaced with a mocking version which claims to know BC's history but doesn't show it well in its performance. This is speaking especially in regards to the programs ability to play chess; its "artificial intelligence" ("AI"), if you will. The ability for BC to calculate moves has been severely dumbed down in GoK. Anyone who has played BC from its beginning (I myself grew up with the 1992-3 version, which I hold very dear to) will know just how damn hard the thing is to beat, even at its NOVICE level: Battle Chess's AI saw EVERY possible move and, more so, every possible opportunity to gain and save material points 5, 6, 7 and more moves down the line; it knew how to schemingly find skewers, pins, double-checks and silent evasive maneuvers that no average good player could humanly find within a few seconds (or even minutes) of thinking. BC has beaten several other excellent chess computer programs, including ChessMaster. It was freakin' frustrating as hell! Such frustrating superior "AI" has given BC its reputation. Obviously, such a hard e-opponent is designed to teach you to become a more prominent chess player, even if the defeats are diabolical.\n\nOn the other hand, it was sandbox-easy to beat the Game of King: the powerful tactics as described above simply weren't there. Rather, GoK's tactics, juxtaposed to BC's, were hind-sighted, unholistic and predictable, if not simply lunkheaded. For instance, in a game played at “Nobleman” level, the Black queen captured my pawn on g2, which is undefended by the Bishop on f1 since I moved him out to check the King, and my right-side knight on g1 hasn't previously been moved; an extremely dimwitted blunder on my part; in fact, Battle Chess 1993 was the one to harshly teach such a lesson to me over and over again. I can't even believe that, after years of experience in chess, I would make such a foolish mistake. My restricted undefended Rook on H1 was DOOMED for capture without any immediate opportunity for me to capture back!! Or, was he? The next move Game of Kings played was pawn on f7 to f5 to threaten my other knight on e4. This equally foolish move played by the computr opened up a diagonal line for my own queen on C3 to capture ITS Rook on H8!!! It's almost as if GoK deliberately DID this because it didn't WANT me to lose material points easily. Battle Chess would have never allowed itself to make such a move: unless there was an opportunity to cleverly steal more pieces from me, it would have immediately and mercilessly captured my poor Rook on H1, while leaving none of its own pieces up for danger without re-capture. I thought for a second that perhaps it was some sneaky way to expose my own queen for capture. Hey, after all, Battle Chess is known for its surprise attacks, right? Unfortunately for me, surprise attack against my queen was rarely the case. After I did indeed move her up to H8 to capture its Rook, Game of Kings didn't even seem to bother to try to capture my queen back after 4 or 5 moves. Worst of all, and this is the best part, ladies and gentleman: the black queen never took my easy defenseless Rook on H1! All of this was the "Nobleman" level, which was supposed to be Game of King's 4th level of difficulty. I simply closed GoK in dire frustration, knowing that I wasn't playing against Battle Chess; I really wasn't.\n\nI haven't played GoK's hardest level, but I can only imagine that it's barely as good as the original BC Novice level, let alone their level 1, and BC had 10 levels excluding the novice one! I understand that there have been negative reviews in regards to BC's extreme difficulty, pointing to the fact that it's been TOO frustrating that players could never beat it. People obviously want something playable so that they’ll actually buy it. Understood.  On the other hand, I don't think that should be any reason to take out all those difficult levels altogether. Those original difficult levels 1-10 should still be there, in addition to the incorporation of easier playable levels. Again, I can't emphasized this enough: they were what defined the Battle Chess series!!\n\nI've covered the main part of my review, but the "AI" is far from the only thing needed be mentioned.\n\nThe tutorial is a rather cheesy duplication of the one made in the 1992-3 version. It offered nothing new in explaining chess, and then the mediocre voicing of the characters were pretentious, trite, unenthusiastic and simply uninteresting. The "sumo-"sized rook, for example, spoke in a rather superficial European accent (Italian?), and one would not feel the threat of his almost-monotonic dialogue, "If you don't understand, I'll smash you." (In the original 1992-3 tutorial, the rook had a rasp, crass and intimidating voice that varied in pitches as he emphasized the different words of that same dialogue, which excellently portrayed the sense of threat that he means to.)\n\nSpeaking of which, isn't the Rook supposed to be a tower that transforms into a wretched stone beast, not a tactless obese "Sumo" guard?? Again, another proud tradition of Battle Chess which has been broken, since in all of its previous versions the rook indeed was a stone beast.\n\nFinally, another BC tradition broken, minor though not insignificant, is the color coding: it appears that OldeSkuul has switched the colorsaround so that red is assigned the BLACK pieces and blue the WHITE pieces. I contactedtheir FB page, and BurgerBecky responded that she will create an update with the option to switch the colors around. So far, no such update was made. (I'm guessing it's on queue to be worked on after the bugs.)\n\nIn conclusion, while it's pleasantly enjoyable for a pastime, Game of Kings is as good as any decent chess program and is nowhere near as good as the Battle Chess it’s supposed to be an upgrade from. To save my pride for the chess program that has taught me so much about chess since I was7, I can't call this Game of Kings version "Battle Chess". The 1987, 1988 and 1992-3 versions are the ones I feel rightful to call Battle Chess. However, take heart, my word is only the unofficial opinion of one user in the minority, and it's not to discourage folks from buying it. As far as anyone's concerned, it does after all do the job nicely. Furthermore, most of the younger generation will probably not be able to relate to anything I'm saying, since this is probably their first exposure to the BC series. Finally, I'm aware OldeSkuul is putting much effort in making updates to the game. There's always a chance to turn an unofficial negative opinion around. ;)\n\np. s. I want to extend a note of gratitude to Olde Skuul and express how much I appreciate them having taken on the project to finish Game of Kings when it couldn’t be finished by Subdued Software. I was aware what financial trouble they had to go through to finally gained enough to open the option for online play. Thank you greatly for the time, effort and devotion!!","April 1, 2014","true","22.6"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","11","15","0","1"

The pieces are detailed and easily recognizable, the online multiplayer works well (have played 4 online games so far), it just needs a few more players in the lobby.  I have only played against the AI on the 2nd skill level (out of 6), as I am only a beginner at chess.  It's not too difficult as to be frustrating (as some chess engines are), but still somewhat challenging as a way to improve.  I am happy I saved $10 by buying the early release.\n\nI recommend disabling the battle camera, setting it to windowed mode, increasing movement speed, disabling the post-processing filter, and adjusting the resolution.  After playing many games, I prefer to have battle animations disabled, although an option for shorter, simpler animations would be very nice.\n\nPlease add me to friends if you want to play a game (since the lobby is often empty)\n\nThere are a few minor issues which will hopefully be fixed soon, none of which break the game however.","April 30, 2014","true","29.9"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","11","15","0","1"

Some of the combat animations still make me giggle today when I think of them .... ahh childhood memories ...\n\nI bought this early access over the weekend with hesitant optimism ... I spent a while playing around with it and the game definitely has promise ... some of the transitions bug out a little bit ... and some of the cuts are a bit jarring ... but the foundations are there for a faithful sequel to the original ... the humour is there (even if some of it feels a little bit forced) ... and there are now multiple combat animations for each 'combination' of pieces! ... What I would love to see is them making it a bit more adult (more blood! more brutal combat animations) even if that is an option you have to select ... and also additional character sets (medieval is already there ... but what about fantasy, futuristic, etc ... how awesome would that be!) ...\n\nI can't comment on the AI yet as I played a game on easiest just to have a look around at how the whole thing fitted together ... but all chess games live or die by their AI so I hope that in this day and age we have a great AI ...\n\nAll in all I think they are headed in the right direction ... and hopefully they will be able to smoothen out the bumps and make this a game that I will be playing in years to come ...","March 24, 2014","true","2.2"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","3"

I loved the original, and the second I saw this I stupidly bought it without looking into it. Well, don't, it's not finished. The menus dont do anything, whether it is changing volume, speed of movement, or something as unnecessary as taking back a move, none of them do anything. Music plays constantly over the top of fight animations, even with the music for the fight playing underneath it. Not that that would make too big a difference as the frame rate issues cause animation to be jolty and out of sync. The clash of metal after swords are drawing back for their second strike is a little off putting to say the least. Still it would be worse if the continuously over the top music didn't nearly drown it out, and as the afore mentioned menus not working issue, you can't quiten it down.\nThank goodness Steam now offer refunds, as that's the best part about the whole experience of playing this game.\nI so hope they fix this to be playable. I want to play this, and what I played of it, it looks like it could be fun and humourous. If they do fix it, I will probably purchase it again. In its current state, however, stay away.

The game itself is still fun as I posted below, but it's FAR from a finished product. I would advise everyone to stay away until Becky and the team release a COMPLETE version.\n\nWhile still in its beta stage, Battle Chess is a great throwback to the classic 3D0/Dos classic game of medieval strategy. The 3D pieces are well-animated, with a variety of animations for each capture (my favorite being "Boogie Knight", where rather than engaging in outright combat, the knight and queen engage in a dance-off, after which the knight snaps the queen's neck), rather than the single one offered us by the original, or by recent attempts like Battle Vs. Chess. The music fits with the medieval atmosphere, and the voice acting is... okay, though I honestly miss the whiny pawn from the original.\n\nAt this moment there are stil. a significant number of bugs and crashes to deal with, but as previously mentioned, the game is still in beta, and the developers are taking input from the community as they address each. If you can look past the relatively minor bugs, $10 is a GREAT price for this early access game, especially if you are, like I, a fan of the original Battle Chess.","April 3, 2014","false","17.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It tends to "stop working" periodically so you have to save freequently.  I have noticed that when you save and exit the "Battle Chess has stopped working" window will comes up as you exit the game.\n\nI have been playing with the traditional peices as the animated figures did not work the last time I tried them.

The game description advertises that "it took 2,000 years for someone to make chess better!" If this is the case, I'd rather be stuck in the stone age than play this game for an additional hour. Save your $10.\n\nWhat's to hate about this game? The animations seemed like a great opportunity to introduce some gruesome carnage to the game - however, this is a completely missed opportunity. It's quite slow and the combat scenes leave you wanting for something more - more blood, more action, more... everything. Within 20 minutes, you'll probably be pressing the 'skip' button for both the character animation walking scenes and combat scenes.\n\nI purchased this game with the thought that it might introduce a storyline - something that would make this unique. Wasn't to be found, or I completely missed it all together.\n\nI played the game for 20 minutes - maybe, I didn't give it the chance it deserved - but within that time I found a bug: my characters clothing were changing colors to the opposing team (from white to black) which made it difficult to distinguish my pieces. I love Chess... but this game... at best is terrible.\n\nSuggestions might include: allow the use of the ESC button to quit the animations (fast-track) in game and to exit out of the menus.\n\nThis is a poorly designed game from the ground up. Wish I had my money back. I'm not even sure if you could pay me $10 to play this game again - regardless what 'version' or build stage this game is in.\n\n\n\n","May 26, 2014","false","0.4"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","1"

I'll update this review as performance improves.\n\n[Update 4/15/14] Still crashes every game. Gets further with blue/red than black/white. Cannot recommend.\n\n[Update 1/26/15] Decided to give this another try. Game ran very smoothly at top settings, then in mid-game individual pieces would start losing their textures and turning black, then... crash. This has been in Early Access for a rather long time with little to show for it.\n\n[Update 2/12/15] Signs of life! After the latest patch, the game can be completed without glitches under some setup conditions (primarily as Blue vs Red in the Dungeon setting). However the game still suffers from a variety of crashes, especially when playing Black/White, or starting any game with CPU as first player (unless character models are disabled and regular pieces are used.... but that's not really Battle Chess). This is a start, however, and if the fixes start coming in a more timely fashion my recommendation on this could turn around.\n\nThe Nice: Nice aesthetic, mostly true to the original look. 3 varied environments. Smooth animation with good options for movement speed. Simple effective in-game interface.\n\nThe Meh: Mediocre graphics. Animations have some variety but still rapidly become repetitive. Music is ok but animation music sometimes clashes with soundtrack. All 4 colors have identical faces and wardrobes, varying only in color, which is a lost opportunity in my view. Pieces have impatient shuffling animations to try to add some life but the sounds become annoying.\n\nThe Crap: No controller support. Needlessly slow and ugly menus.

Sure... the computer is agonizingly hard to beat, even on the easier difficulties.  And I found it a little awkward at first, that they switched the sides of the red and blue teams.

My favorite animation, is the one where the pawn acts as Geoffery, and is poisoned by a drink in a golden chalace. I appreciate on how the game depicts its pieces. The knight, is actually a knight. My only problem with this game is that, it is very unbalanced in the way that it is turn-based. Meaning whoever gets the first move has the upperhand. This game has been out for about 30 years, and no one has fixed this. The ♥♥♥♥, nintendo? Also, the only female character, the queen, is a ♥♥♥♥ing mary sue.

There are some key features to the world of Chess that is missing such as a option to request/offer a draw instead of having to force the draw. It came down to King and Rook vs King and Rook which is a draw any computer should take. Instead it forced it for me to exchange the rooks to force the draw.  The game design is nice textures smooth except for a minor glitch and one game crash.  The game does everything that chess player would want, Yet there needs to be more meat to the bone, After seeing all the fights the characters become annoying and old fast and just get in the way and I found my self switching to the classic pieces to avoid confusion.\n\nThere needs to be more of a challenge as the AI seems to be the same on all levels, It grabs what it can and has no ambition and the AI certainly is no Deep Blue.  So once you get passed the New feel, beat the AI and compelete the Skill challenges there is nothing to keep a player from coming back, the multiplayer feature is empty of players, I left it on for a week and no players came in except for 1 admin to see if I was a bot.  So although this game as a lot of sentimental value to me and I'm sure to so many others, unless some major re-vamping is done to the AI and more added to the game, I stick with my chessmaster 10 to tutor me further,  It will be perfect for beginners and new players however more seasonal players and above will just see it smile play couple of games and move on.\n\nThe AI never tries to win and just always pushes to draw - and that sums it up for the game. It does the bare minimum leaving a game with a lot of potential, left wanting...\n\nI love Battle Chess but feeling Dissapointed  - 7/10","September 17, 2014","true","18.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

You don't see actual effort put into things all that much these days. And I'm glad to witness an exception now and again.\n\nBattle Chess, at least for now, feels like a strictly newbie-oriented chess game. The emphasis is mostly put on model/animation variety. It sure does look pretty, animations flow well enough for the most part. Fully-animated tutorial gives you some basic ideas about the rules and history, as well as an actual impression that enthusiasm is strong with these ones. If the developers aim to keep adding new piece textures, boards, clash animations etc. this may one day become the best casual chess game on steam. Not that there's all that much of competition, but you get the idea. What I'd really like to see added to the game is two things - chess-puzzles and some reenactments of history's professional arena matches. Or at least the first one - easy enough to implement, serves a clear noob-friendly purpose, all that good stuff.\n\nSome of the minuses I've encountered so far:\n1) Music volume slider doesn't seem to be affecting anything. Sound FX, on the other hand, does.\n2) Bishop's voiceover work in the tutorial sucks. A lot. Coincidently, it's also the shortest one of them all. Was it really so hard to get some old dude to do the role that you had to keep it short with what you got?\n\nAll in all - you'll get about what you'd expect. Once again, I strongly encourage you to support the developer - it sure is worth the money.","August 19, 2014","true","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

Given its early access, I can’t really consider this an “issue” as a big part of early access is to get community input into the development of a new game while it’s still being actively worked on.  I’m sure the bugs will be ironed out and the game will be stable and provide for plenty of hours of entertainment.\n\nIf you like chess, I strongly recommend picking this game up, you won’t be disappointed. :)\n","April 17, 2014","true","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You don't see actual effort put into things all that much these days. And I'm glad to witness an exception now and again.\n\nBattle Chess, at least for now, feels like a strictly newbie-oriented chess game. The emphasis is mostly put on model/animation variety. It sure does look pretty, animations flow well enough for the most part. Fully-animated tutorial gives you some basic ideas about the rules and history, as well as an actual impression that enthusiasm is strong with these ones. If the developers aim to keep adding new piece textures, boards, clash animations etc. this may one day become the best casual chess game on steam. Not that there's all that much of competition, but you get the idea. What I'd really like to see added to the game is two things - chess-puzzles and some reenactments of history's professional arena matches. Or at least the first one - easy enough to implement, serves a clear noob-friendly purpose, all that good stuff.\n\nSome of the minuses I've encountered so far:\n1) Music volume slider doesn't seem to be affecting anything. Sound FX, on the other hand, does.\n2) Bishop's voiceover work in the tutorial sucks. A lot. Coincidently, it's also the shortest one of them all. Was it really so hard to get some old dude to do the role that you had to keep it short with what you got?\n\nAll in all - you'll get about what you'd expect. Once again, I strongly encourage you to support the developer - it sure is worth the money.","August 19, 2014","true","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

The cutscenes are painfully long and once you've seen one once you may just feel like skipping over it to get back to your game.  I only played one full game with the animations on.  After that I turned them completely off an just played chess.  These terribly long animations take you out of the game.  I would suggest some short animations on the board which do not require a cut-scene.  I love playing animated chess but i don't want to watch a short film everytime I take a pawn.\n\nAlso the game crashes in about 1/4 of the games I play.  From what I understand this issues is getting better.\n\nI only weakly recomend this game because it's still fun to just play chess without animations, and it's early access status still excuses the issues.  However if there is no method for trimming down the cut-scene times implimented in the final release, I will change this to a thumbs down.","June 2, 2014","true","14.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is a true sequel to the original AMIGA classic, in name and in spirit. As it is in early access it is a bit rough around the edges...there are a few crashes here and there but it all works surprisingly well.\n\nThere are several animations for each piece and side, and some are hilarious. The queen is just as cocky as she was in the original =) Hopefully there will be content updates, maybe new skins etc. All in all, though, it is worth what they are asking for sure.","March 21, 2014","true","4.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

So far with this I only saw a couple battles and they were not as fun as original even with the new graphics (personal opinion). I mean remember when the guy in the original got pretty much all his limbs cut off and was hopping on one foot. Anyways they also seemed to be a little tame in the kill factor in my opinion. I'm not a big fan of the big fat rook peice and the queen poisoning him wasn't my favorite battle. I found the music got a bit annoying and also when other music came on like the battle of the knight verses queen they jumbled together. I miss the castle peices that used to smash people and leave their brains on the floor but hey can't fault them for trying to be different. I would love to give a better review but after about 12 moves the game crashed, and I got a little fed up. On the other hand I had a taste and ended up buying battle chess on gog.com and steam has a pretty sweet game called check vs mate which was really well done. I will check back on this game from time to time and see if i can complete an actual full game and maybe get more of a chance to view more battles.","May 14, 2014","true","1.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
