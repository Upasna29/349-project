The strongest selling points to me is the art style and atmosphere in which the game creates. Stepping into the game I was highly confused, lost. Daunted and scared by the whole game. The game is a point and click which I found very difficult and progress was very slow. I struggled straight away on the main menu which was quite amusing as the Main Menu basically puts you into the game straight away.\n\nPositives\n+ Artstyle\n+ Atmosphere\n+ Music was really good, I enjoyed the soundtracks.\n+ Free OST\n\nNegatives\n- Pretty difficult, probably will end up needing a walkthrough (can be a positive if you like hard games)\n- Hints are obscure riddles.\n- Short story\n\nOverall, I would recommend this to gamers who enjoy tough point and clicks, I would also recommend it to people who are general fans of Point and Clicks too. The Art style for me was really awesome and reminded me of some gruesome books I used to read.\n\nI would avoid it to people looking for a simple game with easy progression as this game is pretty difficult and doesn’t like to give you easy hints. I could see it leading to some potential frustration too. I would also avoid if you prefer Point and Clicks with lots of conversation and a deep story line, this is more of a puzzle point and click with no talking at all.\n\nFeel free to watch my preview for a better idea of the game with no spoilers. ;) thanks again.\n","December 14, 2015","true","2.9"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","14","16","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Monukai/recommended/411590/","Monukai","monukai","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Monukai/","1200 products in account","The Rivers of Alice is a short and sweet point and click puzzle game that manages to hit all the right spots. The game follows a young girl, presumably Alice, as she adventures through a dream sequence solving puzzles and meeting friends. In my opinion, this game is a great example of what a point and click game can be: an adventure where intuition and some observation make for rewarding puzzling experiences. While no game is perfect, and this one is no exception, the few flaws the game has are quickly buried by everything it does well.\n\nI credit the beautiful art direction coupled with the great backing soundtrack to really drive the experience home. Gameplay itself is fairly standard point and click fare. The game offers in-game hints and dialogue with characters which are essentially another form of hints. I found that playing through the game without "talking" to the characters offered a well-balanced difficulty, the puzzles took a little bit of thought to figure out what needed to be done, but it was never so hard that it seemed unfair or the solutions illogical once you worked them out. Don't worry about missing out on story by not "talking" to the characters either, "dialogue" is really just pictures that hint at what you need to do to solve the puzzles. The puzzles themselves were mostly well designed and I did find myself using pen and paper to take notes on a few of them, something I always consider a mark of a good puzzle game such as this.\n\nI'm always a fan of games where the different elements of the game come together and work with one another to make a truly remarkable experience, and I think that's exactly what has happened with this game. It's a very unique and very enjoyable experience from start to finish. Often point and click games rub me the wrong way and I often have to take breaks between sessions and lose interest. That's not the case with this game, every time I stopped playing it to do something else I had the itching desire to get right back to it so I could beat it. I rarely buy games at full price, but this is one game I would not regret buying at the full price.\n\nAt the end of the day, I play games for the experiences they offer, and this game offers one worth experiencing.","January 27","true","7.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

First, the constant walking back to the beginning to speak to Sloth was repetitve. I know he is Sloth but even they find the strength to cross ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ highways. Second, the puzzles were impossible to figure out. I literally spent almost 2 hours of my total 5.5 hours gameplay on the rubics cube, wire puzzle which was mostly due to the coloumns glitching AND ALSO DUE TO THE FACT THAT WHEN YOU EXIT TO LOOK AT THE SCHEMATIC THE WHOLE THING RESETS. (takes deep breath) Third, the glitches in this game made it impossible to complete the Metal Monster area. The only thing that kept me sane throughout playing this was the beautiful soundtrack and the stunning artstyle. and the fact there is a sloth character even though he looked like a turtle/aardvark. I would recommend this to my friends so I can laugh at their pain when they try to figure stuff out.\nAlso, goodluck trying to solve the puzzles. There isn't any official guides to this game and the ones out there look like they were done by 3rd graders who hid the class hamster, then drew an incomprehensible map which they then gave to their underpaid teacher who had to play "treasure hunt" to save the hamsters life. This is not an exagerration.","January 26","true","5.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","100","2","2","4","1"

I won't even bother mentioning them, because those things are so heavily obscured by poor programming and an inconsistent (and sometimes very abrasive) soundtrack. Some of the songs are basically just loud noise, and there is no option to turn the music off. That would be fine, because I could just mute my computer, however the game includes multiple sound-based puzzles, so that's not really an option. And while we're on the subject of the sound-based puzzles: they are made infinitely more difficult by the fact that there's a ton of background noise going on while you're trying to hear the sounds you need to mimic.\n\nOverall I don't think this game is really worth playing.

I did get a few hours out of it, so if you want a nice way to chill, and end your evening with some kind music and simple puzzles- you can’t go wrong with this short adventure. There're some headaches to be had, but the puzzles that do work are worth wading through the few that don’t. If you’re looking to breathe in a deep and allegorical storyline- you’ll probably be better searching somewhere else. It’s structureless approach feels less like a Lewis Carroll novel and more like a friend explaining a dream.","December 15, 2015","false","6.6"," 3 of 14 people (21%) found this review helpful","21","3","14","0","0"
