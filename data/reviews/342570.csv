It makes the weirdest sound that can ever be projected towards your ears, it makes you want to firmly grip your ears and rip them off.\n-Game is definitely focused way too much on P2W\n-English is horrible.\n-Your plane bounces for no apparent reason...\n-Controls feel awkward and makes no sense whatsoever.\n-Not allowed to slow down the plane\n-Payment is required to join games...

Boy was that a mistake. To say this game is a simulation game is an insult to even the worst flight sims out there. You have two directions of movement. Up and down, Left or Right. Essentially you only have Pitch and Yaw. They attempt to make it look like you have roll by automatically in the direction your turning, but that's it. Also, you pitch stops at the 180 degree mark. You can go straight up or straight down, but you can't do a loop of any kind. So basically you can't preform even the most basic of combat manoeuvers. In other words the controls are very basic, which you would think would be a good thing for a casual game, but it goes against even the most basic principles of slight. As far long term gameplay and progression, I really can't say much as I never intend to play this game again. Seriously, if you are interested in a free WWII flight sim, go for Warthunder. Much better graphics, much better controls, basically much better everything. And you can even drive tanks too! Seriously guys, avoid this one like the plague. World of Warplanes is significantly better than this, and that's saying A LOT!","March 4, 2015","false","0.4"," 15 of 25 people (60%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","60","15","25","2","1"

When in first came out in the late 00s it was a novelty, there wasn't another game like it. However it was very niche, and still is. What you need to remember is that this game is nothing like World of Warplanes or War Thunder. Those can loosely be called action simulators. HIS is a third person action shooter with a world war two aerial combat theme to it. THere is next to no relism except for the names of the aircraft.\n\nIt has its flaws. The graphics are retro in a bad way, the sounds are as well. You really have to be interested in dogfights and arena combat games to get the most out of this.\n\nIts good point is that it is fun if you go into it with an open mind and no predetermined expectations.\n\nThe only thing HIS has in common with Warthunder is the same as what Assassin's Creed and Dead Space have in common.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/legoj15/recommended/342570/","legoj15","Reynbad","http://steamcommunity.com/id/legoj15/","39 products in account","EDIT: This is a day after my initial review. The Steam version is worse than the original version, and their website is formatted so badly, I thought I was at the wrong place. Seriously, that is NOT English (even if you do set it to America/UK) This was fun when I was 8 and had no other games to play and was a F2P scrub.\n\n(Original): I remember playing this game back when I was in elementary school on Windows XP. I even invited some of my friends to play with me. I had 2 main characters, both high levels. Then came along more realistic simulators, WoT, World of Warplanes, and the most popular (and my favorite), WarThunder. Comparing this game to War Thunder is like comparing the 1998 Half-Life to Portal 2 or Counter Strike:Global Offensive; it's dated, but it doesn't stop there. When I was younger, I didn't notice all of the horrid mis-translations(or just bad grammar) because I knew no better.\n\nThe gameplay is either a tad interesting or boring out of your mind. You can play with up to 4 online players (friends, or an open lobby) or by yourself in a mission that has bad AI with the standard guns you get in the game, which suck. Somtimes you can pickup drops from enemies witch go into your inventory, which you can use to upgrade or build equipment or IS equipment, that being said, there is a rarity scale for items. On the topic of Missions, there are 8 chapters, each of them holding about 20 missions each, with (almost)the same exact enemies. You can also participate in online tournements, where a LV1 person will sometimes glich into existence and TAKE OUT YOUR TEAM OF WELL 'EXPERIENCD' LV70s FOR SOME REASON(because there are supposed to be level gaps in the tournement lobbies you can participate in).\n\nNot much else to say. It's like WarThunder, it has squads n'stuff and you shoot down other players sometimes.\nP.S. To get my old account back, I had to install the online launchers game over the Steam version so it would give me the option to login on startup. Good example of a game where I don't want to give it a good or bad rating, but I'll say this: try it, and read the bad aswell as the good reviews and decide for yourself.","March 6, 2015","false","1.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I definetly notices a LOT of problems, unlike games like War Thunder (I'll be comparing these 2 games a lot) you can't actually do loops, or rolls, or really anything that involves you flipping over. Also most planes/blimps don't actually have hit boxes, weird but true. There is custimization, but as far as I can see, the custimization doesn't really affect the gameplay. Now, the menus. Their clunky and jumbled and the main menu is an assortment of buildings from a top down veiw (kind of like Kerbal Space Program except executed poorly) and there is this weird... club penguin kind of thing were instead of from the top down veiw your in your plane and you just drive around the place and can select the buildings from there, but I don't know why anyone wants to do that. Something else I want to point out is the graphics are like microsoft flight simulater back in 2000! It's not even close to comparible with War Thunder or World of Warplanes.\n\nI gave it a 4/10, a bad thing about this is it released itself in the time of War Thunder, and World of Warplanes, it really doesn't have a place here, nothing here can compare itself with any of those games. I recomend instead of coming here and scraping the bottom of the barrel, you go out there and get War Thunder or World of Warplanes. I guarantee you'll have a better experience. I know this literally JUST released but currently at this state, you just can't compare it with anything. A valiant effort certaintly, but definetly nowhere near good enough.","March 6, 2015","false","0.4"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","3","7","0","0"

The gameplay is pure arcade, point at it and it dies. I critisize it cause the game is bold enough to say its a simulation! Missions are pure fictional bulls.hit together with any stats your plane might have.\nControls are a mess, you can switch them to mouse but then you got no control of your plane anymore.\nIn the middle of your base is a fuc.king cristmas tree - no a MAGIC TREE !!! And on every page are countless links to their store where you have no choice after a while but to spend lots of money in, but wait it gets better: You cant actually buy what you want there, no, you buy boxes that MIGHT contain what you want so you play lottery for your real cash and dont think that one ticket is cheap no way! It is the most bold, twisted and disgusting Pay to Win System ive seen so far.\n\nOh and i was trying to figure out how to quit this crap game for at last 10 mins until i gave up and killed it via Windows Taskmanager.

It has a steep learning curve for those that have short attention spans, the game has depth if you know what to look for. I highly recommend that you use a joystick if you a flightsim junkie you should have one. The crafting/upgrading is a little hard to get use to but try stuff and you can get some great gear. Unlike WoWP and War Thunder you don't need to buy space with real money to continue playing (I know I have over 100 planes in WoWP) It's lacking in the PvP department but if you like running missions it's great. I played this game years ago when it was under GameCampus and it just was released on steam so you shouldn't think thi is a new, prolly 8 years old or so. Some of the sound effects are bad.\nBut all in all if your tired of the Ramtards in Warthunder and World of Warplanes give this a try.","September 1, 2015","true","7.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","1"

When I say arcade, it`s not even a joke, if you are looknig for realism go elsewheres, if you are looking for a simple to play game with a large option of planes to pick and play with just for fun, shotoing down planesi n various missions, then this is for you. In short if you are just looknig for a fun laid back game, this is for you, if you are someone expecting it to be a game competeing with War Thunder then you need not even look causr this is nothing like it aside from world war two planes. The missions are 1-8 players going up agaisnt various air and ground npcs with various objectives. Leveling in this game isnt bad, but being free to play they do tempt you with items you can buy with cash to give you an edge, like any other free to play game does. The plane models arent horrible, once again this game is arcade in almost every sense, controls are other keyboard, mouse, or controller and are very simple. You can swamp out various engines, propellers, armor, and weapons on ANY plane you have and is only limited to the type of the plane and your lvl. Personally i love this aspect cause no plane is the same, except outward apperances which soon may also change.\n\nOver all it is just a funny arcade war plane game, notihng like war thunder so if that is what you are expecting then you wont like this at all. Very simple game with various things to do from leveling, getting planes, modifying planes, and doing missions. This is a game for someone who doesnt really have a lot of time for say fifthteen minute long missions and just want to play for fun, yes you can put hours into it, but the leveling is fairly quick and missions typically are quick and easy, not all of them seeing how they all differ. Not high graphics so you dont need a fancy gaming computer to run it. I would reccomend this to any casual gamers looking for a simplistic game that still has vairous things to do and can play for a couple of hours and you feel like you`ve made progress.\n\n\nAlso something to mention, this isnt a new game other than it was revived, was originally around in 2010 but GameCampus who orignally had it leased/rented which came to an end and now is owned by these guys.","March 9, 2015","true","18.9"," 66 of 135 people (49%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","49","66","135","7","2"

So I thought: Well since most of the negative reviews hates on the game's flight models and stuff, and the game isn't supposed to be realistic, and it's actually supposed to be an MMORPG but with planes, I decided to give it a shot.\nHere are the pros and cons:\n\nPros: - Easy to learn\n- Don't have to pay to win or to have fun\n- Tons of planes\n- Tons of missions\n- Missions can be played in co-op, or alone\n- PvP and PvE modes\n- Can run smoothly on any computer\n- No lag\n- Easy to level up\n- Easy to get new upgrades\n- Not a grind fest, making money and getting unlocks and rewards is quick and easy.\n- Lots of parts and items to upgrade your plane with\n- Storage warehouse for un-used items\n- Tons of Quests that gives you bonus rewards\n- Extremely detailed tutorial quests to teach you how to play the game\n- Fun to play\n\nCons: - The game's graphics look like it's from 1996\n- The damage model is just a simple health bar, no individual components that can take damage\n- Can't do barrel rolls or loops\n- No plane engine sounds\n- All guns sounds the same\n- You can fly through enemies without taking damage\n- Only 3 different death animations for planes, 1: The plane's engines starts burning, and a wing breaks off, and the plane spirals to the ground and explodes. 2: The plane's engines starts burning, and the plane spirals to the ground and explodes. 3: The plane doesn't burn or anything, it just spirals to the ground and explodes.\n- No throttle control\n\nOverall I find it fun to play the game, even though the controls and gameplay is really simple and easy, and the graphics are from the 1990's. It just feels fun to play, and there's a lot of content. Even more content than some AAA games. It has almost as much content as War Thunder. Lots of maps, planes, missions, weapons, upgrades, and so on. If this game had tanks like War Thunder, then I would say they have the same amount of content. It's still a great game though.\n\nLong story short: Great game, great fun, tons of content, no grinding for money or levels, you should totally try it out!","March 15, 2015","true","3.7"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","20","1","5","0","0"

That was including mine, the popular Raptor1, in the fleet HIS Allstars, who did quite infact create the CONS (Coast of Norway Shadow abbreviation...)\n\nIf you just got it on Steam, not to worry, they MOST LIKELY won't take it off or move their account database.\n\nBad graphics?  So?  It's the gameplay that counts...\n\nBrain-dead AI?  First of all, you are probably playing EUR1, and not doing a mission higher than Mediterranean on Ace.  Also, raids are pretty hard as well, you need at least more than five people if you want to complete them.\n\nPlanes not turning all of the way?  If you have a USB Joystick, they can.  What else could you flip it with?\n\nI used to play it back in 2008, when War Thunder didn't exist and this was a really popular game.  It's the gameplay that counts, not the graphics or audio.\n\nYou have to spend more than an hour on this game if you want it to get super fun.  The beginning missions (EUR1 and EUR2) are so much easier, especially on the Rookie difficulty.  Once you go further, things get tough.  Also, PvP is quite fun to play.\n\nOverall, I don't see why there is so much hate.  I think this game is really quite good, and it has its reasons to dislike, but are they good reasons?\n\nUPDATE:\nI have talked to GameUS, and they were willing to talk with me and discuss these issues.  Maybe the reason they tried to friend you was to help you become satisfied with the game?  Before being quick to judge, give the game and GameUS some time.  They are aware of lots of the bad English, and are trying to fix it.  After all, it's pretty good being that GameUS is in Seoul, Korea.  Like I said, just give it some time.\n\nAlso, notice that most of the people that had bad reviews played for less than two hours.  In two hours on League of Legends, I honestly had no idea what I was doing, but I still had fun anyway.  Also, remember that this is an arcade style game, and not a simulator.","March 5, 2015","true","77.6"," 12 of 28 people (43%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","43","12","28","2","0"

Please don't pass this game by it is very fun to play with friends and is just great overall. That being said you are going to have to settle for how the graphics are now because this game is from 2006 or 2007. Please dont let this game fall through again it can really be fun if it is given the proper player base and if you like arcade controls this is definately a game for you.\n\nPros:\n1. Most of the playerbase is nice\n2. Graphics are not as bad as people say\n3. Arcade controls are easy to master\n4.Quick progression to later planes (you can stay on biplanes if you want though)\n5.Good coop gameplay and if you dont like coop you can put a password on your game room\n6.Earn way more than you spend on repairs (better than some F2P games in this respect)\n7. Axis and Allied airplanes and three subfactions out of each faction\n\nCons:\n1. May have to watch some youtube videos to fully understand some features\n2. Graphics (only here because im letting public opinion in)\n3. Sometimes takes players a long time to ready up\n4. Sometimes you get kicked from a room for no reason whatsoever\n\nIn my opinion the Pros of this game outweigh the cons by a lot but ill allow you to make your own decisions and choose whitch games you like/ don't like for yourselves. Seriously though this game deserves a better playerbase so it doesn't start to die again. People need to see past the graphics and see the awesomeness of the game thats behind that bunch of pixles. Really every game ever made should be treated without the stupid graphics bias that comes with modern games I mean some games now hit a little too close to reality and that is not what gaming is about.\n\nGameing is getting away from reality if only for a little while because while gaming you become the person you choose to be and I hope that everyone chooses to be themselves and treat others and new or old games without bias and give them all the benefit of the doubt.\n\nThank you if you read this whole post/ reveiw and I hope this helps you decide wether to get the game or not.","March 5, 2015","true","7.0"," 10 of 24 people (42%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","42","10","24","3","0"

I have personally verified all 3\n- This game is by NO MEANS P2W, I can NOT STAND those PoS games that are (WoT/WoWP)\n-There is a full screen mode, it is in the settings, so try and actually LOOK AROUND for what you are complaining about\n\n!!!Most of the negative reviews are by those who simply hop in for 5-10 minutes, find no outright eye-candy, and come in with undue bias towards anyhting remotely non-SIM.!!! So far, EVERY complaint listed by the top 15 Negative Reviews are non-existant, or outright clouded by wrong expectations.\n\nNow for the review:\n\nHITS is a game GREAT for those who are looking for a fun, laid-back MMO based on ~1930s-1950s aircraft, whether Prototypes, Paper Planes, or "normal" military aircraft. This game is by no means a looker, but is well optimized for laptop users and those with aging desktops. Hell, I can run it with my backup Integrated GPU on my spare laptop with no lag. (2.5 GhZ OC)\n\nThe game is somewhat faction based, with you being a PMC allied with either the Axis Nations or the Allied Nations, with you being able to make a character for both factions if you so choose. You get 3 Nations aircraft, regardless of which "Nation" You choose, in addition to Gunners [Heavy Fighters] and Bombers, [Dive Bombers, and traditional level-flight types] and these trees are quite fleshed out, and, if they continue bringing in aircraft from the Original HITS, there will be many more.\n\nThe economy is quite easy to adapt to, and is partly player driven through trading of just about everything (Recommended way of buying things outright) and requires not a single dime of your $$$ to enjoy. All you can buy with real cash is minor details such as nose art, or minor other details for your aircraft which offer anything from 10% increased EXP to 10% Increased Drop Rates for missions. There is no Premium membership [!!!!] and nothing is more than a few $$ to buy.\n\nCons:\n-Some questionable translations, though if you speak Deutsch it is fine\n- Minor text issues on item drops, but is easily negated.\n- Ok Graphics, but not designed to be a showhorse of such.\n\n\nOverall, I would rate at 8.5-9.0 out of 10.","March 22, 2015","true","43.0"," 38 of 82 people (46%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","46","38","82","8","3"

My father has open heart surgery, and my mother had cancer... Shortly after the worst of it hit, the game was canceled... I was devestated, even became suicidal, as i had nothing else to keep my mind off of the situation i was in... However, i recovered, and went on to help other suicidal people get over their problems. When i found out the game was back, i was so happy i was in tears... As for my conclusion to the review... To those haters out there, its not a "serious" or "hyper-realism" game, its an arcade styled flight combat game, meant for fun, not for all of you morons calling yourselves "mlg pro" or whatever.

Look the game is not new! It is a steam release of a game that has been around for a few years. I started playing HIS when is came out a few years ago and it is a great ARCADE game!!! I am a licensed aircraft mechanic by trade and play all games involving aircraft. I love War Thunder because it is an amazing SIMULATION aviation game. I play HIS because it is a fun ARCADE aviation game. HIS has a lot of aircraft that were experimentals like the Vought XF5U (Flying Flapjack). Warthunder does not have many experimentals.\n\nBasically, if you come into this ARCADE flying game and expect it to be like a SIMULATION game you are in the wrong place. I personally like the item, upgrade, and skill systems in this game. It is a relaxing way to pass some time with airplanes.

After getting ranks in missions you get exp and cash and unlock harder difficulties for each single mission. On each mission you also get a rank like D, C, B, A and Ace, which gives some replay value if you want to get high rankings.\n\nNot to mention there are tons of quests per mission that will grant you additional exp and ingame cash.\n\nYou research different planes in tech trees from different countries. You can make up to 3 characters in the game, and with each character you can either choose Allies and Axis. The Allies consisting of American, Russian and British planes, and the Axis consisting of German, Italian and Japanese planes. Each country having their own tech tree.\nThen there are also different heavy fighter and bomber tech trees.\n\nAfter you research a plane, you buy it, and will always be able to select your previous planes if you so desire. You will never lose any of them.\nThe upgrades of planes are universal, as in you get Engine1 and Gun2 on your plane, then switch to another plane, that same Engine1 and Gun2 will be equipped on that plane.\n\nThere is item crafting that you can make with spare parts you get from rewards during missions.\nThere is also PVP, however I haven't played that yet since I prefer to just do coop missions with friends.\n\nThe best thing about this game is in my opinion the feeling you get when you just mow away a group of planes with your machine guns or rockets. Highly unrealistic, but very satisying, and acceptable since it's an arcade game.\n\nAll in all a very fun little arcady WW2 plane game with a lot of missions to do either alone or with friends, constantly upgrading weapons, engines, armor and other stuff while trying to get higher level planes. Definately a good time waster if you want to put your brain on 0 and just shoot down hordes of planes, either alone or with friends!\n\n\nI'm very sad to see all the negative comments it gets, or the stupid comparisons to War Thunder. It's not comparable.\nPlay this if you want to mow down enemies with your brain put to 0 and have a laugh with some friends.\nIf you want to have a more realistic experience where strategy is key, then yes, I suggest a game as War Thunder, but i'm not saying that one game is better than the other, because these are not comparable.","March 12, 2015","true","20.7"," 3 of 10 people (30%) found this review helpful","30","3","10","0","0"

The thing is that you should know what you get before you even start playing.\nYou get an easy to master flying game that presents the user with mission that beome harder and harder to complete throughout your tour of duty. Most of the later missions should only be completed in a group (Co-Op), because they got split objectives scattered all across the map.\nThe graphics are good enough for a game of this age and everything runs smooth.\n\nA big no go for me is the pay to win style that gets across on the later missions. At some point you're not able to fly anymore because you spent all your energy and the only way to refill that energy is through buying some items or by waiting 24 real hours. And that's just bad.\nBut, on the other hand, that's what Heroes in the Sky is all about, like with any MMO; trying to get your money.\nUntil you hit that "we want your money" part; you'll be having lots of fun with the many different planes, weapons and missions. So, if you like a nice arcade flying action game with Co-Op/ PvE and PvP; Heroes in the sky might deliver you some good old skool fun.\n\n","March 5, 2015","true","13.4"," 10 of 25 people (40%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","40","10","25","4","0"

Secondly this is an OLDER game! Now that I got that outta the way HIS is an arcade style flying game that has allot of random stuff to it and yes I have played it before it came to steam... it has a large selection of planes and is free to play and you really dont need to pay money to get good stuff in this game you just have to grind a bit... the graphics are good for a game that I think is more then 5 years old... I can run it on high graphics on my work laptop if that says anything. You can make a (Guild) Fleet, you can squad up with people or friends and play the cheap story line through. When you get into the higher levels the more challenging and fun it gets... its just getting to the higher levels that will take you a minute... I recommand if you are going to play this game start by sticking with one country and one line on the plane tree to conserve points! So you can upgrade your planes as you go along... sell the junk you don't need to gain money... and shoot everything that moves... if your into the PVP thing is kinda fun until you run into someone that spent some real money then you might die... if your looking for a fun game to play on the TV with a controler... you could try that... I think of this game as a ramped up version of an old classic 1942! If you keep that in mind when playing it and not looking for another War Thunder... or a super flight SIM then you will like it... and its not a time hog game either you can play here and there and relax and come back to it later. There are still a few bugs in the game with text and things game play itself seems to be pretty smooth... I couldn't find a voice chat in game and it is kinda of a pain to the exit the game... you have to CLICK CHANGE SERVERS (FYI) then click exit... (hint hint devs put in an exit button) Give it a try its free and fun and can pass the time as a new airplane shooter game on steam. I'll update this if I find anything more relavant.","March 4, 2015","true","66.8"," 9 of 25 people (36%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","36","9","25","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/VonMenschen/recommended/342570/","VonMenschen","[OW] Thayr von Menschen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/VonMenschen/","36 products in account","Now, before you make an assumption that I am 'just another twit who doesn't know the game', be advised that the time is just my Steam. I played this way before it was on Steam, immediately before school, etc, etc. I'd make an estimate of at least 50 or more hours spent.\n\nThis game is, to me, a good example of an arcade. It is not meant to be realistic; that would be for the simulators, like War Thunder, World of Warplanes, or DSC World. It is not meant to be realistic; it's meant to enjoy the murdering of your enemy as you spam machineguns and missiles (which are mildly seeking).\n\nThose who complain about the graphical aspects...it's graphics suck. I will be blatantly honest, they are flat, and at times, they suck. The people do not look realistic. For all sakes, it is from 2007, and graphics aren't everything. That's like watching pornography for the good storyline. You are enjoying the gameplay...for all sake, people play Minecraft, Terraria, and others, and they do not have the best graphics. To me, that is just a plus...means my PC can actually run it.\n\nI think this game is bombarded by twits who do not understand the concept nor the time; it was 2007.\n\n11/10, I will continue to play.\n\nEDIT\n\nOK, so I've played it for a while and...this game is not the one I played before. Lemme explain.\n\nThere are multiple errors in the game. First off, and most apparent, is the grammar. This might not be such a great issue...but as I said, I played it before. The Gamescampus version did not have those issues, and changing what is clearly a done job to a worse job is not good. In addition, in the Axis tech tree, certain Japanese aircraft are named in German. That is NOT what you do, and annoying. Again, minor yet was not present in the previous version.\n\nNext off is the 'supply missions'. This involves flying-about and going through floating boxes made of wood. This is random, to me. It's also not fun, because all you are doing is flying. No, that is not good gameplay.\n\nNext is the gameplay actions. In certain missions, the GM can choose what they want to do. This usually involves certain class-oriented goals, like 'Attack retreating troops' or 'another target is spotted'. This, this I like. It provides a certain amount of choice in the player's day. However, there is one mission (d*mn me, but I don't remember it) where you can also choose 'supply crates found'. If you choose this, retreating troops appear, and vice versa. This, this I do not like.\n\nNext is the AI. Before, it was OK that there was quality of quantity. However, I played, recently, the 'Weapons Testing' mission on Allies where one flies against ME-262s. For those who don't know, these are jet fighters Germany fielded near the end of the war. As such, they suck in a turning-battle, yet are amazing in a run-and-gun scenario. I'm in a prop plane. What do they do? Engage me in a turning-battle where I am guarenteed to win. This is annoying and easily moronic.\n\nI also have some complaint on the faction numbers. Simply put, there are more Allies than Axis. This makes it extremely hard to play Axis, and extremely easy to play as Allies. This is something I, personally, don't like.\n\nI have come to realize that, while the majority of twits don't understand it, those who do should understand that it was FAR better before, and this is an unacceptable downgrade.","March 19, 2015","false","13.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","5"

And I was dissapointed.\nThe game, altough pretty lacking and difficult to navigate through, is actually an okay basis for a perhaps, dare I say it, good game. The controlls are difficult at first, and the language selections is for me totally unusable.\nAlso, I'd like to see a bit more historical things, like the corrections of granting you rockets on a biplane. I'd also suggest an actual way of not being able to fly up indevinetely.\nBut, I guess that it does have the potential to become something eventually, it just isn't right now.\nI am interested to see where the game goes, and perhaps I'll hear from it again someday. Right now, I feel like the game isn't finished and shouldn't have been on Steam. It's in my opinion still a pretty bad game. But who knows?\nOverall, I'd recommend giving it a try, I got a giggle out of it.\nA fair trade for the fiveteen minutes of my life that I'm never getting back.","August 12, 2015","false","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

BAD, because first it's a Pay to win game like a 1000 of in game credit cost a 100$! ARE YOU KIDDING ME, THAT'S LIKE A WEEK OF FOOD FOR ME! Second of all the controls are just terrible like I can't fly the thing, and devs... there's a thing called a mouse. Third, the graphics look like it's from a Nintendio DS game. FOURTH, The physics in the game are just horrendious like the planes are bouncy when I crash to the ground. Fifth, The audio of the plane sounds terrible, like with the enemy aircraft sounds like a space weapon going off. So for conclusion, Just get War Thunder it's free and it's better than this cancer, and guys and gals... don't get this game","May 28","false","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
