"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Stexen92/recommended/297860/","Stexen92","Stexen92","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Stexen92/","116 products in account","Split/Second is, hands down, my favorite racing game ever and one of my all-time best games.  I bought this game for both the PC and the PS3 even before it came to Steam and I played the hell out of both versions.  This is a great game that any racing fan should play at least once and is also a great entry game for those wishing to check out the genre.\n\nThe premise of this game is, frankly, not very original but sets up the game nicely.  You are a contestant on the new explosive racing show Split/Second.  During the course of the "season" you will have to compete in races to advance to the next "episode."  Finishing higher in events will get you more points and will allow you to progress further in the season.  Each episode is capped off by an Elite Race, a race around the track against Split/Second's best drivers.  Beat each episode to win the season championship.  Like I said, not very original but it gets the job done.\n\nThe gameplay is very simple.  You race around a track, drift around the corners and use power-ups to destroy your opponants.  However, the center piece of this game is that it doesn't use traditional power-ups like those in Mario Kart or Blur.  Instead, you attain energy through drifts, drafts, and air-time.  Once you have enough, you can activate power-plays on the track, which usually involve destroying parts of the track to crush your rivals.  Filling up your energy all the way will allow you activate the biggest power plays on the track and will also allow you to change the track's route (if the track has a route changer).  Racing hard while effectively using your power plays are essential if you want to win the season championship.\n\nIn addition to the races, there are also several other types of events.  The first one is Elimination.  It's similar to the race, but there aren't any set laps.  Instead, a there is a timer that counts down.  When the timer reaches zero, the last place car is eliminated from the race.  Survive all eliminations to win.\n\nThe second event is the Air Strike, where a helicopter shoots missles at you and you have to dodge the missle waves in order to gain points.  The longer you last, the harder the waves become to dodge.  Gain the most points to win the event.\n\nA variant of the Air Strike event is the Air Revenge, which is kind of like a boss fight.  Instead of getting points for dodging missles, you get power-play energy in addition to the energy you get from drifts and jumps.  You can then use the energy to reflect the missiles back at the helicopter.  Down the helicopter in the shortest amount of time to win.\n\nThe final event is by far my favorite: Survival.  Here, semis are driving around a track while dropping bombs in front of you in order to kill you.  As you stay alive and pass these trucks, you gain points.  Passing several trucks in a row without dying will increase your score multiplyer.  Get the highest score to win the event.  I have sunk hours on end trying to beat my own high scores, so I think you'll get alot out of this mode.\n\nOn the down side, this game's graphics are pretty standard.  It looks okay, but if you're more accustomed to the realistic racing games like Forza then you'll definately notice the difference.  There are also some glitches and hitbox issues that, while not game-breaking, can lead to outburts of rage over what the heck just happened.  Sometimes, though, the glitches can be entertaining in their own right (like getting killed by an explosion and restarting a hundred feet in the air).  These issues, however, are very infrequent and most likely won't dampen you experience.\n\n[EDIT] As for the controls, there isn't a manual shifting option, which I don't mind but some might be a bit miffed that this wasn't included.  Also, the initial key set-up is a bit weird.  You drive using the arrow keys and use the right control and right shift buttons to activate power plays.  I assume this was done so that a second player could use the WASD area of the keyboard when doing split-screen.  Thankfully, this is easily remediated since all inputs can be remapped in the Options menu, but it's still a bit jarring when you first start.\n\nSo those are the basics of Split/Second.  It is very simplistic but very addictive.  There's also a bit more to the game than what I mentioned, but I'll leave you to discover those on your own if you wish to pursue this game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Masterchiefs/recommended/297860/","Masterchiefs","Belegarssøn #ianmcshanerocks","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Masterchiefs/","951 products in account","First things first:\n- Steam Trading Cards is available now.\n- You may notice the DRM warning about SecuROM. Yes, this game HAS SecuROM, but it doesn't USE SecuROM. Confusing, eh ? From what I gathered, SecuROM was wrapped inside the .exe file and the activation process was automated. There's no limited activation, you can launch the game from Steam and there's no pop-up about SecuROM, so basically, this ♥♥♥♥ can be ignored completely. TL;DR: SecuROM is inactive in this game so you don't have to worry about it.\n- Multiplayer is dead, master server was shut down several years ago. However, you can still using Hamachi to play with friends or even play split-screen co-op.\n- FPS is capped at 30. I personally don't mind this at all.\n- Very limited graphics customization. You can change resolution, v-sync and overall quality. However, the game's well optimized and there's no stuttering or freezing during gameplay.\n- Mouse is not usable, just like F1 games.\n\nThat was all technical stuffs you need to know. About the game, Split/Second is still a freaking great game as it was 4 years ago.\n\n+ Great graphics, car models look awesome, try switch route and you'll drop your jaw when a freakin' carrier starts collapsing. Cars look bad when they're destroyed though, it feels like their body parts just start detaching rather than being heavily damaged.\n+ Racing + Michael Bay explosion. The formula of a ♥♥♥♥ing intense tv series.\n+ Great soundtrack.\n+ A great variety of game modes. We have classic races, elite races a.k.a mini tournament, airstrike (dodge missiles from helicopter), air revenge (kinda like airstrike but you can deflect missles and troll helicopters), elimination (last car standing)...\n+ Simple enough to play, but really tough to master.\n\n- I don't know why the hell they put a limitation on name characters (I tried Masterchiefs but the game showed ************).\n- Only two camera angles.\n- Infrequent hitbox glitches.\n- Weird control, but you can rebind keys later after the tutorial.\n\nWith the multiplayer is offically unplayable, I don't think the game's worth $20, but a 50% discount or more would be strongly recommend. Split/Second is fun, enjoyable and unique (well, not that unique but Blur was removed from Steam so I guess there's no other choices right now). If you want an action racing game that's simple but also addictive, then look no further, Split/Second is ready to blow up your monitor.","October 9, 2014","true","12.7"," 69 of 74 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","69","74","0","2"

But the game itself is great if you enjoy a pure arcade expeince. So for the main portion of this game I'll give it a recommend.\n\n\nAfter playing this game four years since its release, I've really got my money's worth because of the excitement that this game provides. But first let me say that this will be mostly based on my review on the console (which I played the game mostly on).\nOkay so how should I say about this game: Micheal Bay explsions (the good kind!), crazy crashes, on edge races, and drifting everywhere! This game provdies a great orginal arcade experince to the racing genre by using the enviroment as your weapon. Exploding taxi cars to a falling cargo plane, this game provides an on edge experince that puts you on your toes, watching for the enviroment that may crush your chance at winning. There's a great varity of obstacles that you can use to crash your oppenents to gain that first spot position. Even though after a while that you'll immediately remember what objects that will be used by your opponents, the fun factor is about stragatizing your moves, or powerplays. Powerplays are basicly your main mechanic of triggering the enviroment around you to stop your opponents from pulling away. With the blue bars representing the small powerplays that are mostly scattered around the tracks. And you have your red bars which triggers the more drastic or "epic" powerplays which will most likely wreck your opponents. These powerplays are fairly balanced which you can aviod by memorizing their actions when being acitvated. The objects that you can use your powerplay on has a nice unique features based on what enviroment is being raced on.\nThe tracks in this game are decent to say the best. Some have a good balance of alternative routes, but there are some routes that can completely waste a considerable amount of time, expically with shortcuts. But at the same time with shortcuts (which are used by powerplays), the game is trying to teach you again to stratagize your powerplays bars so that you can be prepared whenever you come across one.\nBack to the track design, the tracks in the game can be both fun and fustrating, based on your vehicle of choice and playstyle. Tracks like Downtown or Power Plant can be a bit fun and annoying at the same time because of the tight corners, but can be mastered with throttle control and again the vehicle of choice. Whereas tracks like Dry Docks will rely more of vehicles with higher speed and a bit less corner efficiancy.\nThe vehicles in the game are decent to say the less in terms of being competitive. I feel that the majority of the cars in the game aren't that useful to drive because of their drifting capabilities. There are some that drifts out really wide and doesn't grip that well with the road and there are those that can grip around corners like it's on rails. But that doesn't goes to say that those that grip that well while drifting are bad. The Goliath and the Titan, which are trucks, are mostly useful for tracks that isn't technical and rely more on straights.\nThe handling in this game is a bit weird. You can't simply do a smooth turn in a long hander turn of a chicane because of the dramatic loss of speed as compared to the tapping on the analog stick. So wheel users, I wouldn't even bother.... But the pro about the handling is that each car has its own handling characteristic, so every exeprince with a different car would be different than the other, which is great for a arcade game.\nComparing the AI's to the PC port and the console port, it's better in a sense that the AI's are compeitive, but at the same time, the rubberbanding is a bit ridiculous in the PC port which makes it fustrating to get 1st in all races.\nHow do I think of the PC port as compared to the console overall? Honeslty, it sucks. There's a couple of things that may turn PC players away from this game: One is the frames are capped to 30fps, which to some is immersive breaking, but personally for me I don't really mind that much. Second is the icons for the Xbox controller isn't there......at all. I'm literally shocked to see that Blackrock (which went defunt) or Disney Interactive didn't even add controller support for the PC port. The graphic options isn't there either, just the basic quality options. So if you want to turn off AA or lower the shadows, that AIN'T happenin'. Some of the sounds in this game are muffled, which is weird. From what I've heard, the multiplayer is dead, unless you use a third party software or program. And oh yeah, there's no DLC for this port either, which made me a bit disappointed.\nOverally, I'm a bit neutral about this port, the basic's in this game isn't that different with the console port, which I'm glad, but I wish that they gave the PC version more support to make it equally enjoyable.\n","November 19, 2014","true","13.1"," 38 of 44 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","38","44","0","3"

Every bit as good as the console version for XBox 360 or the cloud-based OnLive service - and with a controller, it plays the same.  Highly recommended for a great, highly-entertaining racer.  It's a lot of fun and will uninstall/reinstall to your account without issue.  Sure, I have some gripes about frame-rate and resolution options, but it's easy to overlook those.  Don't let yourself miss out on the experience of one of the greatest racing games ever made.  Maybe someday another company will hijack this basic concept and run with it, taking advantage of new-gen graphics and processing.\n\nNote:  There is a save-game glitch that occurs at or after the Midway Pass episode.  Don't quit the game when this appears or else you'll risk your save file corrupting and losing all of your progress.  You can get around the glitch by playing through the next two or three races (the number of races you'll need to play through seems to depend upon where the autosave glitch happens).  This glitch will resolove itself and, once it does, you can continue playing as normal or exit the game without worrying about the autosave file corrupting itself and erasing your prior race history.  Whatever you do:  don't exit the game before the glitch has a chance to resolve itself.","November 23, 2014","true","38.6"," 25 of 27 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","25","27","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Whiteswart/recommended/297860/","Whiteswart","Whiteswart","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Whiteswart/","1424 products in account","Split/Second is a year 2010 arcade racing game, which goes faster than NFS right from the start, and giving much more king-sized demolition than the Flatout. With that said, it is a mediocre game, which can be fun, but not for long. There are enough of breathtaking sequences, but they satisfy much better from the backseat, on youtube, rather than playing that yourself.\n\nNo doubt, it is an engrossing moment, when in the middle of race a transatlantic Boing crushing right on your head. And it is even better when you dodge this flight in the last second. Too bad, but for the most time of gameplay, you'll be the one under the blast and not one around it.\n\nOf course, like almost always, there are non-optimal controls. But, what is more, there are too little field for player to tweak the race for own benefit, but to choose a car to drive. Those cars provides a little of variety in proportions between speed, acceleration, and so on, but, in the most cases, you'll be driving two, maybe four cars through the whole game. All other variants are just "for show", for "big numbers", and not for real variety and usability. You can't really tune cars for your style of driving or for certain circumstances, that is the first real downside.\n\nSecond big mishap is AI, which will always be one step ahead of you, even after you managed to blow all and everything around you in little pieces. Just the few seconds later, it will be you who'll be ripped apart, without any chance to dodge.\n\nYeah, about demolitions, dodging and racing in general. The main feeling from racing is the same as with NFS games - you can push from borders without loosing speed, you almost not need to slow down in corners, and yet catching the track just fine. But when it comes to dodging the explosions... It turns out that their physical modelling is very far from natural. For a thousand times you'll be thinking you are ways away from blast, but will be in flames an instant later.\n\nAnd the fourth nail is the bad optimisation. I have a dvd with that game which works much better than "always updated" steam version. There are a major problem with missable/breakable save games, which made so many people raged there on steam. Blast the DRM!\n\nWith all that said about downsides of the game, I'm still vouching that you may try it. Especially if you buy it with some major discount about 80% of price... I'd say that Blur, the classmate of Split/Second, is much better, and should be picked first, for much more enjoyment... But Steam not selling Blur anymore. So if you are into arcade racing, but get tired of NFS and Flatout series both, get Split/Second! It'll give you some fresh air, if only for two or three nights... It's still better than nothing, right? And what a marvelous explosions you'll taste there!\nOverall mark - 6.95/10 - best when under 5$ price, even better in some bundle.","February 17","true","55.9"," 23 of 28 people (82%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","82","23","28","2","9"

Considering this is a game of 2010 and it feels like something of this year, gives it a lot of credit.\nYou race through different destructible tracks, blowing up your opponenents via triggered explosions and changing the track altogether. There is almost no HUD to inhibit your perception of shower of visual effects thrown at you. There are many different cars for different tastes and playstyles, each handles and acts differently on the track. Great dynamic soundtrack changing to the pace of action.\n\nThe only downside for me is that it does not have official multiplayer support. This game deserves to be on Steam servers. As an alternative you can use Hamachi if you have a group of friends or tune in to Tunngle server room of Split/Second to play with random people (unfortunately cheaters are present there).\n\nAnyways, it's an amazing, breathtaking and fun experience even for solo-play.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jusplathemus/recommended/297860/","jusplathemus","jusplathemus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jusplathemus/","212 products in account","*Foreword: While this game just recently made its way here, I have been playing for years now, for a couple hundreds of hours at least, so my "hrs on record" is a little off.\n\nThis is an arcade racing game where you have to drift/draft/jump in order to get your bar filled up so you can trigger power plays. Power plays basically trigger explosions in front of you to take out your opponents. (The explosions will harm you as well if you time them poorly.) As this is a racing game, the aim is almost always to cross the finish line first.\n\nPower plays have two levels. Level 1 power plays range from simple explosions (like dropping explosive barrels on your opponents) to blowing up gas stations, planes, etc. With level 2 power plays you can blow up a bridge/dam/ship/road, or make an airplane crash land on the track and so forth. Some Level 2 power plays are also route changers which destroy part of the track thus opening up a whole new (usually faster) section while blocking the old one.\n\nThe more I played, the more I realized that this game is all about timing. It really makes a difference when you trigger the various explosions or when you make that explosive barrel drop. There are also simple power plays, where you open up a door temporarily to take a shortcut. The ones behind you can get a free ride through as long as they are close enough, but once the door closes, the rest of them attempting to get through will crash.\nThe various cars feel very different. Some of them start to drift easier, some are harder to blow up, some fills up the bar faster, etc. There are a couple of game modes too, but not all of them are playable in multiplayer.\n\nMy biggest "problem" with this game is that there are only 11 tracks. But it has a Split/Screen mode which is a rare treat nowadays. I already had countless hours of fun playing with my friends side by side.

Sucks that the servers are down, but ♥♥♥♥ happens. The rest of the game is still completely worth the money. It shouldn't be too difficult for anyone who's looking for a good smash em up racing game. It's explosive, fast paced, and a unique turn from your typical broom broom simulator. The controls for keyboard/mouse are honestly pretty nice, though I still prefer a controller (Which may be an issue for some, I know it was for me. I used to pinnacle to get mine working smoothly). The game itself is fairly large and should keep you entertained for as long as most games do, maybe longer. Graphics wise, looks beautiful even by today's standards. And apparently there's a 30 fps cap? To me, it honestly feels like it's not there, if it truly is to begin with. Awesome game, completely worth your money.

Turn poorly and draft which allows the speedhacking AI to easily overtake you as you're turning wide/slowing down.\n2. Not be in first place and follow someone for 10+ seconds\n3. Almost get him by AI traps (only way to gain power while in first place)\n\nTo actually win in this game you need to tail the AI in first place and kill him right at the end using traps or expect to randomly get overtaken right before you win by an SUV that according to ingame stats is worse in every single stat comparatively to your god car.\n\nOh, and the AI will NEVER attempt to blow each other up at all, ever. Its basically a 1v7 race where the goal of 6 of the cars is to delay you so the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ in firstplace can get an impossible lead or remove all your power so you cant kill said ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.\n\nIn summary its a very fun CASUAL "blow all the cars up simulator" i honestly cannot call this a racing game, because for it to be a racing game you would place depending on player skill, and in the single player campaign that is not how the game works.\n\nThe detonation/survival/airstrike etc gamemodes are probably the most fun/repeatable features you can play in singleplayer/competitively with a friend because there isnt any AI to cheat and its argueably "skill" based. That is until you run into impossible airstrike patterns because the helicopter decided that the small 2lane section of racetrack right after a corner where you are is a perfect spot to drop 8+ missiles.","January 1","false","7.4"," 12 of 23 people (52%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","52","12","23","2","0"

If you like to have the outcome of your game be based on your skill level, look elsewhere as this game cheats so blatantly that it renders this game absolutely unplayable.\n\nJust about every major gameplay aspect of the game is pointless in terms of competitive racing.\n-Drifting? Pointless. There is no effective way of recovering from a drift and it does nothing to help you as it slows you down to an incredible level.\n-Unlocking cars? Pointless. For every new car, your opponent AI automatically gets a car that is at least two level above yours, so whatever car you bring into a race makes no difference whatsoever as you will always automatically be in a disadvantage. (Every opponent car, regardless of model, will have a better acceleration and top speed than you do)\n-Powerplay? Pointless. Each time you wreck an opponent car, they receive a huge acceleration bonus as well as speed bonus, making them able to catch up to you within the matter of seconds.\n-Taking the lead? Pointless. I have seen cars that literally spawn right in front of me right before the finish line, so you can be in first place and two seconds away from the finish line and still end up in fifth as you see four other cars spawn right next to you and zoom past the finish line.\n\nHow such a fantastic idea of a video game came up with such a poor level of execution is beyond me.\n","November 29, 2015","false","6.7"," 6 of 14 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","6","14","0","0"

It can run even on basic gaming systens, and it's a great way of putting casual racers against veterans in a game that evens them out a bit. It does take some getting used to, both in the handling of the vehicles, and also the "explosives" to watch for. But it's great once you learn, and it's quick to pick up.\n\nAs with everything, there are some issues. Only a few things, like no controller icons within menus, and nearly unnoticeable anti-aliasing, but those aren't really important. My main issue was the sound. The engines sound great, the sound effects too. And the music adapts to the events going on around you. Seems awesome right?\n\nWell, unfortunatrly, the game seems to have been incorrectly levelled (audio wise) or made for Surround Sound, as the Engine and Music are drowned out by the "Whoosh" of passing opjects, the "Boom" of explosions, and the sounds of Trucks and their Barrels moving around.\n\nA simple fix would be an indendant volume control for these sounds. Sadly there isn't one. But it's worth playing all the same.

That sounds like "PARTIAL" controller support to me.\n\nRacing experience: This game is no better than the mobile game series Asphalt, in that the controls are just as basic, and dare I say the car/racing physics in this game could even learn a thing or two from Asphalt.

Rather buy Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed.\n\nI bought this game here on Steam after having pirated it a while ago due to it being difficult to legally acqire my side of the world. I had a crappier PC back then, and it would not run very fast (or so I thought). Having a newer PC now gave me more reason to replay this. After playing titles such as Battlefield 4, DiRT 3, Bioshock Infinite on very high graphical specs with a silky smooth framerate, I expected this game to look extra silky smooth; Boy was I wrong, the framerate is capped at 30FPS and there is noticable stutter on top of that.\n\nAll in all, it is a very enjoyable racing game, I like the mechanics and I absolutely love the sound effects in the game, when you drive through tunnels, it honestly feels like the wind is rushing through your hair sometimes; albeit the immersion breaking FPS. The audio does have noticable compression artefacts. The online servers have long since been shut down, but split screen is still available.\n\nIf you are looking for a racing game with similar mechanics, rather go for Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed","February 26, 2015","false","2.0"," 3 of 11 people (27%) found this review helpful","27","3","11","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DrumBreak/recommended/297860/","DrumBreak","Icarus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DrumBreak/","53 products in account","This game is similar to those virtual reality arcade games from the late 90's: horrible, sticky controls, graphics all over the spectrum, and a game design that won't let you escape.\n\nWhen I bought this game in febuary of 2015, the reviews praised this game, and there was not one downvote on the whole site.\n\nI was aprehensive at the Disney Logo appearing upon booting up the game, because they did a very good job of not letting that slip on the store page.\nit just went downhill from there.\nthe game immidiately throws you into a tutorial without further explination. as it teaches you to drive, it rattles off the game's interpretation on a tired, cliche plot. (Smash T.V , anyone?)\nan additional note; the game's default key mapping uses the arrow keys, which i find horrid. not only that, but it also disables the mouse. good luck learning how to navigate the 80 billion menus with your puny little arrow keys.\n\nanyway, so it takes you around the track at least twice. my indifinitiveness is based on the fact that i did not complete the tutorial. the game called for a key i did not have access to, and so i had to abort the tutorial. good thing you CAN NEVER GO BACK TO IT AGAIN.\n\nSo, once I left the tutorial, I was greeted with a menu that is cut-and-pasted out of Ridge Racer. Now, I dont know which came out first, but considering the impression R Racer had left on me, my confidince in the game was dropping like Seattle's Space Needle in level 2. But I'm getting ahead of myself.\n\nThe game comes with this 'revolutionary' autosave feature, that can identify when something has changed or not. not very well, i might add. the autosave means that you get 0 feedback from the menus, which resulted in me having to restart the first race 4 times to get my key mapping saved.\n\nwhen you enter the race (after 4 or 5 more menus, at least), you get a few vehicle options. a muscle car with poor acceleration, a truck with poor acceleration, or a lamborghini bootleg thats faster than hell but is made out of balsa wood. you can guerentee getting destroyed at least 3 times on the first lap.\n\nas soon as you start the race (two more menus later), something becomes painfully obvious. three-second cutscenes are the latest, greatest thing (or thats what the developers thought). This game has these tiny cut scenes everywhere, and they rapidly begin to get old. but thats not the irritating thing. You cant skip these Random-camera-angle anthologies. instead, pushing 'enter' or 'space' will bring up the pause menu. that means instead of skipping some pointless Replay, you may restart the race, or even exit to the main menu unintentionally.\n\nSo you say to yourself; "ok. i can put up with annoying game design. but how is the control?"\n\nthink of it this way:\n\nevery car is a mercedes\n\nIf you have never driven a mercedes, all i am saying is the car control is as floaty as a cheap balloon puppy from a B- list clown. you slide all over the place when you drive, so much so that its actually a mechanic. I am sure they only incorperated 'Drifting' into the game to overcome the top-heavy, tractionless vehicles. its bad enough as is, but the steering is even worse. it seems to me that steering was programmed at one tragectory, and if you're going too slow or too fast, steering is going to feel extremely heavy. so if you come to a stop, consider the race over, because even tapping to go left will drag your car all the way to one side, preventing you from going straight.\n\nFor the finale, lets talk about the focus of the game, because half of you out there own it just because you saw explosions on the thumbnail.\n\nyes, there are explosions, and for the most part, it is very satisfing to see chunks of flaming metal rip apart the opposing cars. even the trigger mechanic works well, allowing some challenge timing-wise while not becoming frustrating. the only mechanic that doesnt work well is the indication on what IS blowing up. in fact, there is none. you'll trigger an explosion, and for 2 seconds blue text will tell you you did just that. but it wont tell you where it is, or how big, which can often lead to you blowing yourself up. in addition, being in first place leaves you nearly defenceless, because it is nearly impossible to target backwards and drive forwards.\n\n","February 26, 2015","false","2.5"," 2 of 9 people (22%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","22","2","9","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/JetUppercut/recommended/297860/","JetUppercut","Jet Uppercut","http://steamcommunity.com/id/JetUppercut/","202 products in account","Split/Second is a racing game. Or at least that's what it's creators would like you to believe.\nI affectionately call these titles 'modern' racing games, because they have very little do with racing or playing a game.\nIt's more like watching a movie while you steer a brick of lead with soap wheels through a QTE filled landscape of different shades of brown rubble.\n\nUnlike most other racing games, skill plays almost no part in whether or not you win a race. The AI rubber bands to an incredible degree and seems to only ever target you with Powerplays, meaning opening up the alternate routes while you're in the lead is a terrible idea, since it just gives the AI more ammo to fire at you.\n\nThe pace of the game is barely above a crawl, with the difference between the 1-Speed cars and the 5-Speed cars being almost negligible. I never bothered unlocking anything higher. Drifting also serves to slow this down even more, so if you hope to win any races, don't let go of the accelerator ever. Not that you would really need to.\n\nYou often have nothing to do with the Power you accumulate while in the lead. You can't activate Powerplays that are behind you or boost. Often just leaving you a sitting duck.\n\nThe powerplays themselves range from explosions to bigger explosions. Sometimes you can activate shortcuts but usually the game won't let you. I assume this has to do with this game's overarching theme of punishing you for being too good at it.\n\nYou'll often find yourself in first place, sailing 5 seconds ahead of the rest of the pack for them to fly past you at warp speed 300 feet before the finish line to just immediately slow to a crawl. However if you smash into walls the entire race, hang back and draft to activate Powerplays and are sitting in 2nd or 3rd before the finish, you'll usually win. The Air Strike mode also has an amusing tendency to decide you're going 'too slow' around a hairpin corner and just fire a salvo of missiles at you.\n\nThe Elite Races are just races where you go up against cars that are much better than yours. While the expectation is that you'll come back to these races later with a faster car, I was often able to beat them on the first or second try. I had enough series points that I was unlocking the next elite race immediately after finishing the last one, which just shows how poor the pacing in this game really is.\n\nOverall, I would say that this game doesn't even manage to make it's own gimmick, literally being that you are playing a stunt driver in a TV show, interesting or engaging. The recurring set pieces and genuinely horrible AI make for an uninteresting and uninspired racing game lacking any substance, but much of the flair we have come to expect from say, a Michael Bay movie or a McDonald's Cheeseburger.\n\nThe fact that this game influenced an entire genre to effectively commit suicide by copying it's sluggish gameplay, brown city environments and severe lack of speed is shocking. Thank the Indies that we have games like Drift Stage and 90s Arcade Racer to look forward to.","October 13, 2014","false","6.7"," 25 of 60 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","25","60","0","0"
