"http://steamcommunity.com/id/UltimaLyca/recommended/416110/","UltimaLyca","Rye Roen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/UltimaLyca/","190 products in account","I received a review copy from the developers\n\nIf you’d prefer a video review, have a look here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=atfuDj-x0fQ\n\nDo you like Super Meat Boy? How about all those death gauntlets filling up the Mario Maker servers? Do you get a kick out of spending 5 hours on a level -- your right hand reaching for the doritos upon every death and break in the action -- to finally complete it before moving on to the next (which’ll take 6 hours by the way)  in a seemingly endless loop of misery for a grand total of a mere, maybe, 5 seconds of satisfaction?\n\nYeah, me neither.\n\nWhich might lead you to believe that this is gonna be a negative review of Blitz Breaker. You’d be wrong. The fact that this game, a really difficult (at least in the last third) 2D platformer, had me glued to my seat, me being a self admitted hater of platformers and all things mario, for 6 hours straight one evening, is why I think it’s a fantastic game.\n\nBlitz Breaker does have its slow moments, but all in all it’s a much faster game than Mario or even Super Meat Boy. And it’s because the developers opted to do away with traditional left and right walking controls in favour of slamming their heads against a wall repeatedly.\n\nI don’t mean that as an analogy of the oftentimes tediousness that is developing video games, but instead literally. The way you traverse the map in Blitz Breaker is exclusively charging in a direction until you hit something; with the odd hop every now and again.\n\nPresentationThis game is very beautiful for what it is. At first it might just seem like a typical retro inspired 2D indie game, but it’s the camera shake whenever you bash into a wall,  it’s the extremely easy to miss splashes when you enter or exit the water, it’s the tiny golden pulse of light whenever you collect a coin. All of these things throw Blitz Breaker into modern times, and the beautifully made animations combined with the appropriate thudding sound effects and the surprisingly memorable soundtrack create this nearly flawless presentation that I think makes up 50% of the reason I enjoyed the game so much. I don’t know how big the developer Boncho Games is or exactly who works there, but they have an incredible eye and ear for production design. One detail I particularly enjoyed was the different animations that some of the playable characters have for when you’re just falling. I will say that I don’t think that the game gains anything in particular by cutting off the resolution into the small window, and maybe the levels could have had a bit more colour variety in them, but those are both nitpicks; you soon forget that you are playing on a smaller screen, and the lack of environmental variety can be explained away by the location you are supposed to be in story-wise.\n\nMechanicsThe mechanics are the other half of what makes the game great. The controls are nice and tight and work well with both controller and keyboard though I will say that, while this can be fixed by simply using the d-pad, the analog stick could be frustrating to use here. The thing that I think really makes this a fun game to play from a strictly gameplay point of view though, is that it’s satisfying to zip around a level like you can in Blitz Breaker; narrowly avoiding deadly sawblades and missiles with pure speed and response time. This is definitely possible in other platformers but, outside of optional objectives like a reward for being quick in Super Meat Boy, it’s very rarely required that you act fast. In Blitz Breaker there are many situations where if you don’t move you will simply fall onto some spikes. That combined with the game always introducing new kinds of level layouts, bosses and hazards means the game stays interesting. Ultimately though, if I had to pinpoint what I enjoyed about this game as opposed to something similar like Super Meat Boy, it’d all come down to the controls. I often find in platformers that the controls just feel too floaty, or the way my character moves is too slow, and that’s the case with Mario. In this game everything just feels so fast and responsive, and so it was easy for me to get into.\n\nI’ve really been sucking the game off so far, but it’s time for me to talk about some of the weaker elements of the mechanics. Intrinsically, the way the game works is great, but every now and again I’d encounter a level that just felt like I was running into a wall (no pun intended) over and over again in the hopes that it would eventually break. The best example of this is a particular level half-way through the game called “precision” that is designed around the idea of fitting through tiny little spaces without touching the spikes. It took me about 30 minutes to beat it which is not the longest time I spent on a level in this game, but it stands out to me because I didn’t really feel like I was getting better at the level, or that I had to apply any kind of technique, and so when I beat it I felt relieved rather than satisfied. In my eyes the ultimate platformer would be like a puzzle game; where each level is a new problem that you have to solve by exploring different strategies and ways of approaching it.\n\nStoryThere isn’t really anything to the story. There’s only one cutscene for the game right at the end, and even then I didn’t really understand exactly what the main character was trying to achieve the whole time. It wasn’t bad and it didn’t take away from the experience by being absent, but there’s also no reason why a game like this can’t have a compelling or funny story that’s being told through narration, cutscenes between bosses, or environmental tells. That’s not a negative, necessarily; if you’re interested in the gameplay then this won’t be an issue, but I thought I’d acknowledge that the game could have been more in this area, and definitely gave itself a limiting factor to the kind of people it might appeal to, its distinctiveness from other platformers, and ultimately its memorability. I’d argue that a lot of what made a game like Super Meat Boy so popular was the ridiculous theme and the comedy. That said, I’ll take a nonexistent story over an intrusively bad story.\n\nVerdictGuys, here’s the real kicker. This game is only $3 and I got 15 hours out of it; 15 hours of high quality content. This makes it, in my opinion, an absolute must buy for any fan of platformers, and a tentative recommendation, even, to haters of platformers. If the reason you can’t stand platformers is because of their slow pace, then this is definitely your antidote. And for $3? Everyone should try this game, frankly, it’s dirt cheap so you’re unlikely to have buyer’s regret, and even then, provided you’re going to play it, I don’t believe that, to most people, this game will be a bad investment for them -- and even if you don’t play it you’re only out $3! Seriously, go buy this game (it sounds like I work for them, but for real, this is my genuine feelings on the game).\n\n<h1>Score</h1>\n\nPresentation: 9\nMechanics: 8\nStory: 5\nPrice to content Ratio: 10\nPersonal Enjoyment: 9\n\nFinal: 8.2/10\n\nI’m awarding Blitz Breaker an 8.2 out of 10. The presentation was phenomenal with extremely minor complaints; the Mechanics had a few issues here and there, but were intrinsically sound. The story just didn’t exist, and so it could have been more; the real knockout here, in my opinion, is the price to quality ratio -- this game could have easily sat at $10 dollars, maybe a little more and still gotten a recommendation from me, but this is incredible. And I got 15 hours out of this game collecting all the little optional stuff; getting all the stars; everything! On top of everything else I really just purely enjoyed this game.","February 2","true","18.4"," 22 of 31 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","22","31","0","0"

That last part I said though, that's very important, you're gonna die a lot. You gotta know beforehand that Blitz Breaker is gonna shift between quick reactionary button presses to waiting and timing based sequences, you gotta stay on your toes through every level or you're gonna have a bad time. If you're even considering buying Blitz Breaker, you really should get it considering it's only three frickin bucks, and manages to be a stellar time killer, putting in a few minutes at a time works but so does a half hour. the arrow keys and WASD work with this game as well as the controller, but in my opinion I found using the keyboard (specifically WASD since I'm left handed) the best way to play this game.\n\nSo, to conclude: Blitz Breaker is 3 frickin bucks, it's a total time killer, the levels are wonderfully designed, there are lots of different characters to unlock and they're all cute as heck. Now go buy this game\n\nBig thanks to Boncho Games for the review copy, I had a ton of fun with this game and I'm sure to be playing it off and on for quite a while :D\n","February 2","true","0.8"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","9","13","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MangoTangoFox/recommended/416110/","MangoTangoFox","MangoTangoFox","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MangoTangoFox/","2260 products in account","Steam key provided by the developer for review; I spoke extensively with them in the form of feedback.\n\nScorecard:\nhttp://i.imgur.com/7uaXgpR.png\n\nFull review with screenshots:\nhttp://www.techfreshness.com/game-review-blitz-breaker/\n\nFeature        Y/N/Rating                Aspect Ratios        Horiz 16:9 w/ Border or Vert 9:16                Framerate Cap        144+                Performance        Just Fine                Options        Very Few                Key Rebinding        No                Controller Support/Rebinding        Yes, No\nPC Port Quality\nRuns in HTML5; dedicated fullscreen isn’t available and most injected overlays (Steam, RivaTuner, etc) won’t work properly. No framerate cap; I can confirm at least 144FPS and that it v-syncs properly. The options amount to toggles for music and sound effects, windowed/borderless-fullscreen, and your choice of side art. The side art and border make the whole image 16:9, but one option removes everything and it becomes 9:16 instead. You can set your display to vertical to fill the entire display, but there's no official ‘Tate Mode’ yet to make the switch easier.\n\nWhile windowed, the game is surrounded by a black border until the window is large enough to step up to the next integer. The minimum size is 2x the base art, and it’ll snap to 3x/4x/5x/etc. Fullscreen at 1080P w/ the side art keeps the game at exactly 4x. All resolutions should be sharp, as nearest neighbor filtering is used.\n\nThere’s no rebinding, though there are multiples of the bindings on both the keyboard and controller. You can use WASD/Arrows/D-Pad/AnalogSticks to dash, Space/Enter/Bumpers/A to jump, and ESC/Backspace/Start/Back/Triggers/B to pause. All function identically; there's no analog movement. Both controller and keyboard inputs will function simultaneously, as will any of the multiple mappings on each input method. I used the arrow keys most often, but hdidn't like using my left arm for just space. Jump is used as a small positioning tool, rather than a consistent core function like most other platformers. I externally rebound Right Ctrl and Numpad 0, which sit on either side. It played very well, and should vbe coming in a later build.\n\nGameplay\nIt’s technically a 2D platformer, but it really doesn’t feel like one. Your movements are limited to a short jump, and a vertical/horizontal dash that doesn’t stop until you collide with something. These ations are consistent and it feels very responsive. You bash into the wall, and you’ll almost always bounce outward to the same point. Once you dash you give up all control, but the frame you collide with something you can dash again, and can even prepare that it holding the direction during the previous. Using that technique allows you to go very fast with minimal effort, but as you progress, the levels contain far more spikes along the walls. You’re forced to balance riding the walls to go fast, with timing your dashes to clear hazards.\n\nThe various collectible heads (24 total) are found in secret levels, with others being gated by ‘Stars’, earned by completing a stage with more than a certain value left on the clock. Coins add to your timer, forcing you to not only dash in the proper places to collect them as you go, but it also presents optional paths that are out of your way, but filled with coins so that by the time you get back to the goal you’ll have a higher counter than before. You're often teased as you pass right by the goal to go grab coins in a more challenging section. There are purple squares in 1/3rd of the levels behind similar sections.\n\nThe 101 levels are split across 4 areas. Each have 18 levels, two secret warps of 3 extra levels each if you to collected each purple cube. The final section of each area is a boss, each offering a challenge different from the standard levels, along with bonus heads to grab.\n\nThe Arcade Mode puts you through all the same levels with tweaked mechanics. You have lives, the purple squares change to 1-ups, and coins convert into lives as well. A timer ticks up as you progress, so assuming you can reach the end, you could compete against others with a definitive score for your single run. You can quit out save runs for later. It's clearly meant for speedrunners, but I don’t think it’s quite pure enough. Less than incredible players are actively forced to collect coins and 1-UPs to have enough chances to even finish the more difficult levels, skewing their final score. A pure speedrun mode with just the timer (no coins, pick-ups, or lives) would be a nice addition.\n\nOutside of secret levels use an inverted palette, and some with water, there's little visual variery, but it does a great job of introducing new mechanics as you progress. Combining hazards and obstacles in new ways, it remained compelling the whole way through. It can be very frustrating in certain sections, even more so if you’re aiming for 100% completion. The game lacks a dedicated reset button, which could have slightly lowered the delay between certain attempts. I’m not the most patient, so while I made it through to the final boss, I’ll likely never get every star and collectible.\n\nPresentation\nThe pixel art aesthetic is very simple, but charming and cohesive. Hazards and objects are conveyed well, which reduced some early trial and error, though the hitbox for spikes isn't exactly as you'd expect. The custom heads are really cute, each having extra art for jumping and dashing states, though it would have been nice to see a custom trails to replace the default 4 color rainbow. Some of the character’s movements can snap to the original pixel-art grid appearing choppy, though the dashing movements are too fast for it to matter.\n\nThe wonderful chiptune soundtrack by Fat Bard suits the game extremely well, and it’s on the level that I listen to the OST on its own; I’m a fan of the genre. All of the retro sound effects fit well, but a few are quite loud or abrasive, drowning out the music in small sections. A slider instead of the toggle would help alleviate that.\n\nConclusion\nBlitz Breaker is a relatively simple title and you could potentially reach the end in less than an hour, but it's difficulty and the learning process make it significantly longer. Playing more like a rhythm game than any traditional 2D platformer, it’s a unique, tactile experience paired with well suited visuals, and a brilliant chiptune original soundtrack. It won’t win any artsy-fartsy awards, but it’s a sharp and can have a bit of longevity should you choose to master it.\n\nIf you’ve ever played a game on Nitrome back in the day, you’ll have an idea of what this is going for in terms of content. While those games were often built around sloppy, physics-based controls that made them difficult, Blitz Breaker is precise and responsive. It becomes brutally challenging near the end, but rarely feels genuinely unfair or unsatisfying as it largely avoids RNG-influenced mechanics. As both of my friends and I will attest, you’ll die a ton, but are assured that it is possible, driving you forward each time you pick it up. The star system and unlockable secret levels drive you back to replay and fully complete earlier stages, and in doing so you’ll see just how far you’ve progressed in your understanding of the game’s movement system and ability to read the environments on the fly.","February 2","true","15.2"," 12 of 20 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","12","20","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cyrilpanda/recommended/416110/","cyrilpanda","Cyril","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cyrilpanda/","596 products in account","The story? Nonexistent, but the game doesn't need one.\nThe controls? Good and responsive, no issues with dropped inputs here.\nThe graphics? Passable and never visually confusing, which is good for a precision platformer.\nThe music? Decent, gets old once you have to listen to it so much though.\nBut... the level design... sigh.\n\nThis is just a textbook case of a game with lots of potential ruined by tedious level design. I'm gonna spoil a secret for you: Making something longer does not make it harder. It makes it more tedious. Those 6-screen, 8-screen, 10-screen levels? They could easily be several great 2-3 screen levels. Especially since this game is quite good at not repeating ideas; even the final levels are still tossing out fresh level design ideas without feeling stale.\n\nBut when you have to replay the first half of a level just to even get a shot at the second half, and the first half is hard enough on its own... I get frustrated for all the wrong reasons. It's simply not fun to keep replaying the same few rooms just desperatle hoping for a chane to learn the later ones. The gauntlet levels and final boss are the main offenders here, really, they're mostly too bloody long. Gauntlet VII in particular requires you to replay through the entire level, backtrack through half of it to collect a green key, and on top of that go through the hardest room in the entire level just to get the key. Not to mention an equally hard room right below it that, thankfully, you can skip... and then you have to make it back to the end of the level after collecting the key, backtracking through the room you just went through first. And Gauntlet X... sure, it's the level that will take the longest to clear, but you wanna know why? Because  you have to clear 6 screens of gameplay to even get a shot at the later three, and I have a sneaking suspicion that there's going to be even three more beyond that door in the ceiling (even if there isn't, it's already way, way too much) [UPDATE: There wasn't, thankfully, but my point still stands.] It doesn't help that the bottom rooms are far harder than the upper rooms, and that you have to get through the already difficult top rooms just to even get a shot at the lower ones. It ain't fun, yo.\n\nAm I being fair to the game if I did genuinely enjoy it through most of the first three worlds? Ehh. Even ignoring the awful bonus level, and ignoring the last level of Warp 8 that starts out with legitimately the worst screen in platforming history, there's still too much obnoxious design in the later parts of the main game for me to recommend it. I feel like the bad significantly outweighs the good since it just completely kills any fun factor for me. But honestly if I could I still think I'd rate this a "meh", 'cause it's far from an awful game and a lot of the earlier level design is compact enough and interesting enough to be worth playing, especially for the low price this game is offered at.","February 10","false","12.8"," 15 of 27 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","15","27","0","6"

The simple gameplay does well at first in requiring quick decision making and changing up its mechanics. But soon it becomes apparent that the game has a problem with consistency, as good sets of levels are backed up with ones that don't execute very well. The traps can be hit or miss, as the conveyor belts are great and play off the physics of the game well, but the missile traps don't provide any sort of real challenge whatsoever. And then some other flaws start to show: as the length of levels start becoming a real problem. It starts to punish the player for small mistakes that they couldn't really have predicted in boss encounters, and it turns into a slog as you try a level over and over again, asking for precision that the players already proven repeatedly. The game is fine for the price tag in terms of content, and for those looking for twitch action platforming, it can do the job. But a lack of an outstanding factor to draw attention in versus all the other twitch action platformers out there, and it just doesn't get a recommendation from me in the end. When it goes to mobile, it'll be worth a pickup there.\n\nLists:\nMy Suggested Positives:\nSolid. Does do a good job of twitch action gameplay at first, and some of the traps provide a challenge.\nGame is at its best when it's testing your understanding of momentum and using the physics of the world around you.\nVisually it's not bad. It's got a good selection of alternate costumes and I like the “break through screen” part of the presentation.\nLoad times non existent, and good performance overall.\nMy Suggested Negatives:\nLacks a punch. While it's functional, it just doesn't have something to keep your attention for a long period of time.\nSome levels are way too long. You've tested us with the precision of one specific jump, you don't need to test us repeatedly. And it doesn't help when.....\nYou get the “ooo gotcha” moments, in particular with Boss fights. There's no good way of  predicting the bosses mechanics, and you'll die at least once on each phase. Which is annoying.\nIt just lacks.

You hurl yourself into one of four directions and as soon as you hit something (could be a wall, a magnet, a conveyor belt), you can move again. That's how you try to avoid a series of obstacles - lasers, spikes, buzz saws, mines - while gathering keys to finish the level. All the while a timer counts down, which can only be increased by gathering coins.\nAnd when you're finished with a world, you're confronted by a boss that needs to be defeated.\n\nThat's all there is, really. Nice enough to waste some time. At first anyway. But some stages just drag on and on, which doesn't fit the concept as far as I'm concerned. The final world is the worst offender. And since the last level asked me to move back and forth between multiple rooms (instead of simply moving forward), I had to stop before reaching the final boss. I just couldn't manage to finish more than one room before something got me killed. So good luck finishing the arcade run, where you go through the whole game at once. Not with a single life, though. That would be crazy.\n\nSo, would I recommend the game? For the first few worlds anyway. After that, it might get too frustrating.

I played the demo on Newgrounds and was immediately hooked.  The mechanics are fresh, the puzzles are just difficult enough to provide a challenge without making me too frusturated.  Be warned, you will find yourself saying "Just one more level!" about a hundred times.  I also have to warn you: the learning curve is STEEP.  I flew through 1-1 to 2-2 before anything became too challenging, but 3-2 and up are reeeally hard (not that its a bad thing).\n\ntldr: Just buy it.  Worst thing that could happen, you walk away slightly dissapointed and $3 poorer.  Buy the game instead of lunch today.","February 5","true","1.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Levels are challenging but fair, the pixel art is great, and the soundtrack is superb. This is easily one of the best indie games I have ever played, and for $3 it is an absolute steal! I cannot recommend this enough.","February 5","true","13.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Controlling your cute little character works flawlessly and even though only 5 keys are required for movement there is a wide variety of techniques to move your character from A to B.\nThe level of difficulty is well balanced, the game gets harder and harder once you try to master every aspect of it, beating it casually shouldn't make you rage too hard... except of course... nah, I don't want to spoiler too much :)\nAchievements are interesting and obtainable and NOT crap like "Play this game X hours"\nBugs... well there are none, at least none that I would know of... as soon as anything gets mentioned (bug, request) in steam discussions developers respond and in case of a bug get a patch out a few days later. (A big "Thank you" from my side here)\nThe soundtrack is really refreshing and fits the gameplay\nThe price...I bought the game&soundtrack-bundle and knowing what gameplay this game offers I would have probably paid twice as much.\nCons\nSound and music can either be turned on or off, the volume can't be adjusted. If there actually is a way to lower the volume and I was only too blind to see it I am sorry, but then this definitely is a user interface issue ^^\nNext to achievements there are currently no Steam features available for this game, but from what I've read in the discussions this is something that DEVs are currently working on (Trading Cards)\nAll in all this game is totally worth the money and I would be the first one buying a DLC if one get's added to the game... I wouldn't complain if additional content was added as a free feature update of course :D","March 1","true","36.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's got that good platformer feel and a twist on control. Moving left and right and just jumping? NOT! This game requires wit as if you have to aim properly to get where you're going. The other great spot this game has covered; the soundtrack. I listen to that more than I actually play the game. I would give this a 9.5/10.","March 6","true","1.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/peekingboo/recommended/416110/","peekingboo","PeekingBoo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/peekingboo/","155 products in account","I've personally been addicted to this game from the moment I started playing it to the point where I'm writing my very first Steam review. As such, forgive my lack of structure.\n\nIt takes a core aspect of game design; innovation via limitation to deliver an experience that is similar to, but unlike anything else I've seen before.\n\nRemoving the ability to walk, the only way to get around the map is to blitz in one of 4 directions at high speed until colliding with something, only then can you move in another direction. Moving platforms and conveyor belts assist with this a bit more but the absence of a core functionality of platforming suddenly the game into a sort of puzzle/platformer hybrid.\n\nI would compare it to the likeness of VVVVVV in terms of traversing the landscape in a new and interesting way, but also Super Meat Boy for the way it rewards you for beating a stage faster, opens warp zones via collectibles and doesn't contain a single checkpoint within a stage. You need to play the stage from start to end without dying and to some this might be a turn-off but if you like a challenge you're definitely going to find one with this game.\n\nAt only $3 you should expect to spend around 10-15 hours if you're looking to beat the game 100%, but this is entirely dependent on your skill level and patience. One final thing worth noting is that no death in this game is random or unjustified, it's up to you to git gud.","February 9","true","54.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

As such, you can find my reviewing ethos and scoring systems on the Pastebin review.\n\nGameplay: Controls are very slick and fluid, game is a lot of fun to play very fast, some stages don't allow for fast gameplay but many others are geared for speed, bosses are pretty alright, difficulty curve shoots up quite heavily in the last area but it's not too harsh, stages are very fair and well designed. 8/10.\n\nStory: No real story to speak of\n\nGraphics: Art style is very clean and bright, game doesn't have much in the way of graphics options but it doesn't need to, fullscreens to your native resolution and windowed can be resized to any resolution, uncapped 60FPS throughout for me. 4/5.\n\nSound: Soundtrack was good for what it was, but not something I'd listen to outside of the game. 3/5.\n\n8/0/4/3; 7.5/10. Definitely worth a look, and is much better than a lot of the $3 shovelware drek that gets on Steam nowadays (note: this game is most definitely not mobile shovelware, it was released on PC first).\n\nEdit 1 (2/12/2016): One minor addendum is that they patched out the not so well thought out timed gate that can prevent you from getting a character in the final boss level. This doesn't affect score, but something that should be noted.","February 9","true","10.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
