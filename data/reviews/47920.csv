"http://steamcommunity.com/id/colonelpanic2409/recommended/47920/","colonelpanic2409","Clnl Panic","http://steamcommunity.com/id/colonelpanic2409/","210 products in account","Forza 5 is the racer I really want to play but this game is scratching that itch for me at the moment on PC.\n\nThe handling is very sensitive and each car takes some getting used to but is eventually very satisfying to drive. A good range of difficulty settings and driver assists which you can switch off means you can give yourself a fair challenge and feel satisfied when you drive well. The helmet camera and head physics were my favourite feature from the first Shift game and they return in Shift 2 to make the sensation of racing at speed only just in control of your car, really engaging. Unfortunately the immersion for me goes no further as there is no support for the Microsoft Xbox 360 Wireless Racing Wheel which is my wheel of choice on PC, although in fairness plenty of Logitech wheels are supported. This limitation plus the distinctly floaty nature of the cars' handling causes me to play this game as more of an arcade racer than I do a game like Forza 4, but it is still enjoyable when played with the right expectation. The trusty 360 gamepad is supported and works very well for racing as you would expect. The menus are mostly easy to navigate with the 360 pad but all the on-screen button prompts are for the keyboard. It took me a while to work out how to save settings with the controller (press start) but after some trial and error I can deal with the menus well enough.\n\nShift 2 has a wide selection of real cars and tracks plus a smattering of fictional courses, some of which return from the first game. Full car customisation is provided allowing you to upgrade the performance and customise the appearance of the vehicles quite dramatically. Cars are given an overall performance rating and using this are separated into categories A, B, C, D just as in the original Shift game and familiar to players of other racing sims such as Forza Motosport.\n\nThe game looks pretty good in 1080p and on my machine (i5, 7850, 8GB RAM) with all presets set to High runs at 50-70 frames per second on the whole, though on certain corners of certain tracks framerate drops into the high 30s. I would like to tweak my settings a bit more to achieve a minimum of 60 but the game offers no benchmark mode so checking the effect of a graphics setting takes a long time - many changes even require you to restart the game. It is also disappointing that the low resolution cutscenes were clearly pre-rendered with consoles in mind which makes the unskippable cinematics during the career mode look very out-dated - cinematics should be used to flatter a game, but in the case of Shift 2 it's a relief to get past them and into the game which itself looks very attractive.\n\nThe Autolog and Online play require an EA Origin account (though the game does not require the Origin client). Unlike some players on the community hub I had no trouble at all activating the game or fighting with any DRM. The game installed and played easily from Steam just like any other game. Steam Overlay popped up showing me the product key when I first launched the game but I dismissed that as I have never had to type it in yet. I have tried to get an online match on two occassions and both times I was the only player online and had to create a lobby. Hopefully the sale weekend will get some new players lobbying up but I would not recommend this title if you are looking for multiplayer racing. It does provide a satisfying single player experience for players who enjoy racing against AI and testing themselves on simulations of the best cars and circuits in motorsport.\n\nTo my mind this game was a good buy at the recent sale price of £4.99 but I would hesitate to recommend it at the current full price of £19.99. It is true there are not a lot of other games of this type available on the PC which have the same degree of polish as Shift 2 Unleashed, but there are definitely better experiences out there on Steam for your hard-earned £20.","November 25, 2013","true","4.4"," 74 of 85 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","74","85","0","1"

Great camera and great graphics. This game is not as good as it could be from the start though. You have to patch the game up a bit before it really is the best of the best. If you go to a website called nogripracing.com and sign up, you can download all the mods for this game. What I recomend you do, and this will be confusing to most of you your first time, but download and install the unofficial patch from no grip racing, then install PTMu which will give very realistic handling and car manuverability. At that point this game becomes an absolute masterpiece. I cannot stress enough how much fun this game really is. If you enjoy tuning and testing cars out, and then getting to race them, then I don't see a reason as to why you wouldn't love this game. You don't even need to play career mode, just buy a car and mess around with it. Too bad this game isn't as popular as it desserves to be and I'm afraid for that reason that EA won't make another "Shift"... Please EA, this game is already very good, just make a refresh with better graphics and the PTMu time mod integrated and you'll have an extremely realisting yet very fun and challenging experience. Btw you should at least be using an xbox controller to play this game if not an actual wheel, that will give you much better control.","January 27, 2014","true","308.1"," 75 of 87 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","75","87","0","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/not_odayaka/recommended/47920/","not_odayaka","真「SHiN」","http://steamcommunity.com/id/not_odayaka/","219 products in account","I played this game using the unofficial community patch by nogripracing, so I have no experience with the Vanilla version. Also I didn't delve deep into the tuning options and online.\n\nAs of this writing I clocked in around 37 hours and I am confident to say I really love this game. I played through the first SHIFT and it was my first ever racing game that made the cockpit view comfortable to play with. SHIFT 2 refined the experience with their new Helmet Cam -- The camera is attached to the driver's helmet and it mimics the head movement and shakiness when driving, gives you tunnel vision, and it blurs your vision when you hit a wall. A lot of people say the camera is disorienting, but personally I don't really think so. I was not once disorientated, confused or the effects got in the way of the gameplay. SHIFT 2 is arguably the only racing game that lets you truly be the driver, rather than be the car itself. You feel how scary speed is when driving at 200 miles per hour, underestimate the car, and the car will severely punish you. This what made this game so great for me.\n\nNow for the negatives. The menu system is stylish, but atrocious. The key assignments for the buttons are all over the place. I am playing using the 360 controller and the game can't reassign the button icons to match the controller's.\n\nEarning money is way too easy. Want to buy that certain car? Grind in Quick Race once your driver level is high. Select the Dakota Oval track, set it to one lap and no opponents, and bam, $20,000 per 35 seconds.\n\nVisual customization is basic and practically useless.\n\nThe slightest bump and the slightest touch to the dirt will send your car spinning. To be fair, I haven't rammed a car or drove off-road in real life before, but these annoyances can ruin the entire race because the AI suddenly bumped into you or you get sucked to the dirt like a black hole.\n\nSome of the DLCs are way too easy and one DLC broke the game's pace. The Speedhunter pack gives you the drag racing career, quarter mile career and access to some highly tuned cars. The problem is the cars are free to acquire. I won the drag race and quarter mile career without breaking a sweat because I had free access to the stupidly fast Nissan GT-R. Some of these cars can be used to your default career and I breezed past some of the events.\n\nMy narrator-guy-person-thing is annoying. I loved the British guy in SHIFT 1 and while the new guy is alright, he's too, uh... Not... I dunno. He's not British-ey and kawaii enough.\n\nI hate drifting. I hate drifting in SHIFT 1, and I hate drifting in SHIFT 2.\n\nThe title of the game is stupid. Really? SHIFT 2 Unleashed? What's next? SHIFT 3 Insurrection? SHIFT 4 Reloaded?\n\nOverall I love this game. The negatives are there and noticeable, but the core gameplay, the cars, the races, the tracks, the sights and sounds, are all great.","December 17, 2013","true","59.9"," 37 of 40 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","37","40","0","0"

I also like how some tracks have several variants with common bits.\n- No catch-up! You actually get what you deserve as far as I can tell. Difficulty is dynamically adjusted in the beginning of each race according to your performance but never mid-race as it used to be.\n- Graphics are stunning, camera options are good and make a lot of sense (e.g. two different in-cockpit cams with different settings).\n- Background graphics because no flux were given :D\n- Lots of settings for the car*\n- No DLC ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, existing cars are all good enough to beat the events, your friends and even clock some serious records.\n\nCons:\n- Loads of CTDs and sound bugs. For me the source of CTD persists over the CTD, e.g. if I was playing track A with settings XYZ and it crashes, it's gonna crash with track A and XYZ no matter how many times I restart the game. Then again, it fixes itself if I play A with settings XCV or if I play track B.\n- ...loooong intro videos, yet to look into disabling them. This would be tolerable if for not so many CTDs.\n- General handling settings. I play with KB and like many people have mentioned, there's a lot of input lag. This, however, is not a true con, because you can always disable the "stabilising" setting:\n=> Edit DampeningEnabled="1" string to "0" in vehicleset_pc_custom_[controller name here].xml\nAlso the default settings for tuning are very very loose and unresponsive at times, do not forget to edit.\n- While settings are plenty (see pros), the poor default settings force you to make your own. There are a lot of settings there and the explanations for each setting are decent at best - a bit of a learning curve to get them right and you'll need to tap into actual tuning guides for real world cars to get the most out of your ride.\n- Lamborghini Murcielago LP640 is a Limited Edition only car by default. There are guides to unlock LE cars and events, though, but it's a bit of a nuisance and you'll need to edit the master .exe to achieve this.\n\nTL;DR: To get everything out of this game lots of fiddling with game files, game settings and car settings is involved. For this reason I'm going to give 9/10. Otherwise a brilliant, brilliant game.","November 17, 2014","true","150.4"," 40 of 54 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","40","54","0","1"

So many reviews about the game crashing 24/7 or whatsoever. I can't even recall that it has crashed. I've played both Shift and Shift 2 on my Xbox360 before I got this on pc. Both were great. Looking back at previous Need for Speed games, these two were big improvements. Doesn't feel like Need for Speed, but it's still awesome.\n\nI am quite pleased, BUT two things I can think of now that really bothers me are the Al behavior and those childish cutscenes.\nThe Al are challenging, but in a bad way. I play on hard difficulty because I like a challenge. However, the Al opponents keep hitting and crashing into me, even each other. Looks like they're really trying hard to push you of the track instead of finishing the race. These cutscenes just makes me feel bad. They talk about racing and how it is in real life. It's a long speech which you cannot skip.\n\nDespite those childish cutscenes and deathwish Al opponents, the game is amazing.\n- Runs smooth 24/7 with optimal graphics (Not crashing at all).\n- Lots of tracks\n- A much bigger selection of cars than earlier games. You can have as many as you want and in addition several of the exact same car. Even cars from previous decades can be driven.\n- Drifting is completely different from NFS Carbon where it doesn't feel realistic at all.\n- Just driving at all is exciting. Often I just drive without opponents in cars I love.\n- It is nice to see they use many of the same cars they've used before.\n\nI am happy that they actually made Need for Speed that can be called somewhat realistic. Playing Hot Pursuit made me feel bad, watching the trailer for the newest Need for Speed doesn't make me feel any better. I am very pleased with this game. This is a game for everyone who either loves racing or simply enjoys driving.","December 26, 2015","true","68.0"," 21 of 25 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","21","25","0","0"

However, I can't recommend it to anyone because of a long list of bugs and problems to look out for.\n\nFirst, this game ships with broken Physx so your tutorial race probably will crash the game immediately. There's a workaround for this, but this shouldn't happen in the first place.\n\nNext, even though the multiplayer is dead, sometimes a track will crash on loading as it contacts EA's servers. The workaround is to play with your internet disabled, but that shouldn't happen either.\n\nAnd finally, if you do everything you should, this game will crash anyways. Quite a bit. Fortunately, it's typically before the race starts, but sometimes it will in the middle of the race anyways.\n\nIn the end, I think this is a really good racing game, but is so buggy for something from a major publisher and major franchise that I can't recommend it.\n\nHowever, if you can overlook these flaws, this is a really fun and cheaply-priced Forza-like racing game. When it plays, it's fantastic. But it WILL crash on you and you WILL need to do silly workarounds to get it to stop crashing most of the time.\n\n","September 21, 2015","false","23.3"," 13 of 18 people (72%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","72","13","18","4","0"

The cars in this game do not behave like any on this earthly realm.\n\nDelight as opponent cars suddenly become weightless if approached from behind. Ohhh as they fly off into the sky. Gasp as your car spins out of control for no apparent reason on a flying straight.\n\nThe whole game is depicted as a simulation racer, and some people will tell you that it is. I don't like those people. This game, like GRID is an arcade racer dressed up as a sim. Set your expectations accordingly and you will have a lot of fun with it. Physics quirks and all.\n\nThe sound design is excellent, cars are super loud and sound like they are exploding continuously as you engine break. The sense of speed is also very good if you use the bumper cam but is lost somewhat when using the cockpit view, there is also a helmet cam which is completely disorientating and weird and is only a novelty. The game is also very pleasant to look at.\n\nOverall I give it CARSFLYINGEVERYWHEREOHGOD/10.","June 2, 2013","true","12.0"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

Second i had a few bugs with this game that i had to fix manually, besides those problems it is a really good game. it does take some time to get used to aswell im using the the Logitech Driving Force Gt Wheel & it works great without having to do any setup with this game unless you want to swap from automatic to manual. if you want a even more realistic game i would highly recommend Assetto Corsa and even no thats in early access i still think that is a better all round racing experience and is very polished even now in its early stages. all in all i would recommend this game its a good, fun driving game with a nice amount of tuning and as a nice selection of cars & tracks Nürburgring is my favorite which Assetto corsa does not have....yet.","May 4, 2014","true","3.9"," 12 of 18 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","12","18","0","0"

It's literally one of the choppiest games with some of the worst aliasing I've ever seen on the consoles. I considered it one of the worst games I owned when I bought the PS3 version but the power of the PC made this game a completely different experience.  60fps instead of 30 with the ability to remove all of the hideous aliasing that exists on the console version turns this into one of the more exciting race games to date. It's not pure sim but it is very sim like and works incedibly with a good wheel. Graphics are just a tad dated but the locales, feeling of speed and handling make it really great. 9 out of 10 on PC (1 out of 10 on consoles).","May 8, 2015","true","1.5"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","0"

I've been playing simulators for a long time (with wheel) and when I got my hands on this game... it was on spot, perfect driving experience from the first minute as I started the try-out laps with Nissan GTR... I had no complaints about handling, or physics... just watch some actual, real racing championship events, and how intense it really is, and feels as a spectator all alone, when you watch the race from cockpit... this game has no comparison to any other... and trying to copy this game - well Forza and Gran Turismo won't do it... but they know, that this game is the real deal, when it comes to experiencing real racing adrenalin rush - my first thought was "damn... I am moving" I was so gripped by the sound, the feel, the "helmet cam", that I forgot about track, and next thought was "ow a corner - trajectory, apex, brake, follow-trough, and accelerate" and it did so well at the first time hands-on, that there was no need for assistants - in this game, everything is so seriously over-thought that it blew my mind - I really felt like playing GTR 2 but with that adrenalin rush and confusion and body movement that game physics provide as you are driving... you can't get that in GTR 2, Forza and Gran Turismo...\n\nWhen developers made this game they thought - "This is REAL racing" "Racing Simulator" - do some of these players here even understand how serious that is? to actually be able to drive with high-tech FIA racing car....? .... forget the car.... do some of people can imagine how advanced your level of self-control has to be in your mind alone, to be able to compete in that sport...\n\nAnd when some over-rated company (EA) takes their budget and allows some under-rated racing simulator company (SlightlyMadStudios) to take charge on this project, just to bring all missing pieces - for EA it is physics and driving experience - and for SlightlyMadStudios it is flashy graphics... it just blows off so much that you just can't approach this game as you are used to approach the Gran Turismo or Forza.... it takes huge amount of patience and dedication to be able to just drive quick and fast...( I just got lucky because I am GTR 2 racer, and my driving is not moveable at all from some twitches and flashy graphics - this is GTR based physics game witch is realistic as it can get and complain, I was hands down used to controls from the first corner ) to be able to know when to overtake... you have to read the track every time differently because opponent makes the track a different piece every time... you need to practice driving in the group... you have to start, to re-think how racing actually is meant... in Forza and Gran Turismo - it's meant like "overtake me, if you are moving faster then me, but please, my dear friend" but RACING is a competition and the first competition you have to overcome, is yourself... you have to find out what kind of racer you are, and if you want to get to the finish line, then the most aggressive move you can pull off is "the nose-dive" - and if you think that in this game AI will give up the 1st place easily, you are fooling yourself because just like in real life you have to EARN IT and THEN you can TAKE IT... not the other way around, like it is in Forza and Gran Turismo.... and I wont say that Forza and Gran Turismo is a bad games... but to this game, Forza and Gran Turismo is just another test-drive game in the market.... if you want some real thrill then pick this game up... You have to approach this game seriously, otherwise you'll be another mad-man on the comment section... don't mind that I am writing like a mad game-fan - I am not.... I am just cabined furniture designer who likes to play games a bit in my free-time..... but I am just tired how this game is being treated...you have to be serious, otherwise you get much different opinion then it's meant... this is FIA Racing Simulator - and for the last words... Just watch the real-life race...","December 21, 2014","true","12.0"," 12 of 19 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","12","19","0","0"

No HUD (I always try to get rid of this whenever I can in a  game) with Medium AI, but I cannot do without on a racing sim is the guide lines which is my lifeline in a game like this, so it really really really aided me to be able to have it enabled despite going through the game without any HUD whatsoever. The handling of the cars feels extremely realistic to my nooby racing sim hands, and the sounds made by the cars have forced me to change my underwear 4 times already.

Althought he game plays fantastic on a pad, and is easy to drive which in some cases is more fun than tedious simulation, with a few mods and wheel it can pose an amazing challenge.

Even then you will probably have to turn most of the stability aids on, in order to not be driving on ice.  With my computer you need something better than a G27 for this game to be drivable.  A Thrustmaster T500 will do, but it will probably break after a few months.   Be prepared to do quite a bit of tweeking to get this game to remotely resemble real driving.  There is a patch to fix some of this that has been released by gamers, but it cannot be applied to the Steam version.  So maybe the bargain bin at Frys or equivalant would be the best place to buy this game.\n\nThe good thing about this games is it is fun, you can drift through turns at 150mph and not wreck.  In fact you will have to learn to do this because the cars are continuously loosing grip.\nIt looks pretty good too for it's age.  You can easily customize you cars apperance and performance.\n\nThis game has no multiplayer ability.\nThe worst thing about this game is the AI.  It is horrendous.  I frequently have wished that I had the programmer tied up in my basement so that I could slowly beat them to death with a chain.\n\nReally, it is that bad.  This was programmed by the same people who still don't seem to be able to do a competent AI in Project Cars.  So be prepared for opponents that you beat the entire race, have a huge lead on, and then magically appear at the last turn driving faster than is possible to beat you  (rubber-banding).\n\nAlso be prepared to be smashed into becasue the AI is not actually intelligent.  These other cars will do little if anything to avoid crashing into you, and will at times actively seek to crash into you.  It doesn't matter at all if you drive like a gentleman youself.  You may not think this is a big deal, but if you spend a half hour in an endurance race, and have a chance of winning then some nimrod bumps you off the track, and in Shift2 you are the one who gets the penalty and you lose.  This will happen over and over, and you too will wish the programmers were tied up in your basement.","December 4, 2015","false","601.1"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","63","5","8","3","0"

Just an absolutely beautiful racing game. Very enjoyable to drive, drift, turn, race, crash, and cutting off other drivers to take the lead.\n\nThe visuals are stunning. Seriously, what else do you want from an automotive game? This is 2014, we're all expecting decent graphics by now.\n\nThe game play more importantly is what makes this game stand out from other racers. Sure this isn't the classic NFS where you run from police, but this NFS is more simulation based and can make your heart skip when taking a turn. There are suggestive arrows on the track to tell you how fast to take a turn, however they are suggestions may I remind my reader. They change accordingly to your speed but I feel once you get the hang of how a car handles you don't quite need to rely on them heavily. The tracks are a perfect length and I haven't run into any races that I've dreaded (meaning those races that you have to race for 10-15 minutes at a time). Tracks are also nice, challenging, fun, and some turns just really get you into the game. I've never been a gamer to turn my controller for racing (or any games for that matter) and this was the first game where I felt that displacing my controller may do something (it doesn't but that's how immersed I can get playing). The small drift and loss of wheel control when taking major turns is impeccable. If you do over do a turn and end up hitting the wall, your screen goes hazy and gray to simulate impact. This I do not find annoying but rather amusing and realistic. Damage to your car is also pretty spot on.\n\nThis game get's a solid 8.3/10. Why the extra .3 over my solid rating of 8? The game modes, the UI, just how it was all put together just makes it so nice.","November 7, 2014","true","7.6"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","6","10","0","0"

You can customise your cars setup, tune it, and the realism of the cockpits and sounds seem to represent the real life cars. V6s, V8s V12s and turbos all sound different.\n\nUnfortunately the things it gets wrong is the cars handling is a bit unresponsive with gamepads as there is some sort of controller input lag on this setup, but ive heard this isnt the case if using wheels.\n\nThe other annoying thing is the Computer cars AI is excessively aggressive at times, where they will deliberately swerve off their racing line to shunt you off the road when you attempting to overtake. The collision physics is all wrong and biased here too in favour of the computer cars, whereby a tiny contact will send your car shooting off like a rocket whilst the computer car barely gets affected.\n\nShame really, because is could of all been amazing but its let down by some flaws.\n\nOverall would give a 7/10, but it could of been a 9 or 10 if the other issues were fixed.","December 29, 2013","true","36.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Graphic wise its AMAZING. The car damage and the visuals on the cars, track and audience are just beautiful. Sound wise it's alright. You can barely hear the car sometimes because the turbo masked it. Every single car that you buy already has a turbo installed in it. What also bugs me is that they also added cars from the 40s and 50s that have ♥♥♥♥ing turbo in it. WTF. Alright another thing that is very important in this game is handling. The car feels like its floating/sliding and can be annoying. In 3rd person the car is literally drifting. Those are the 2 things that really need to be fixed if their is ever going to be a 3rd Shift.

It's full of technical issues that makes the game unplayable for many. My experience was that I was able to play the game just fine for one day, then some sort of activation feature kicked in. After going through the activation process the game never recognized that I had activated it. Eventually I found a workaround to activation. I recently installed to a new computer because I was feeling like playing a racing game, again the game played for 1 day just fine, but now it crashes every time I try to launch a race. After troubleshooting the issue and trying some workarounds for a few hours I tried a fresh install. After uninstalling and reinstalling the activation issue popped up as well. Needless to say I'm not going to be able to resolve both of these issues (my old workaround for the activation issue didn't work this time) and this game is unplayable for me. It should be noted as well that even for the time I could play the game, I could only launch it through Origin. It never worked for more than 1 day on steam on either of my computers. Between Origin and Steam I have probably about 25 hours of gameplay and almost certainly more than 10 hours of troubleshooting and fixing issues.","May 22, 2015","false","9.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The driving in this game is terrible. I love games like prostreet, and forza, but this is nothing like them. It force quits, the menu music is awful, the plot's main character is annoying, etc. I bought this %50 percent off, and I REALLY wish i hadn't. Take my word for it, and don't but it. Thank you for your time.\n\n**UPDATED: I originally did not recommend this game for the following reasons:\n-Music\n-Driving Feel\n-It Force Quit\n\nHowever, after becoming really bored, i decided to give it another go. The first thing I did was disable music. I then played with difficulty settings and virtually turned everything off (ABS, Traction Control, Assisted Braking, ect.) The game feels different, but it is fun in a way. The level of customization is actually pretty cool if you are into cars. However, the menus had me confused for a while: when upgrading the your car, you select engine, and it takes you to air filters. At first I didn't realise there were more parts available, such as exhaust, camshaft, and other stuff in other tabs.\n\nRecap: I recommend this game. It is not perfect, but it is fun. Menus are a bit weird IMO, but after i figured them out, it was no big deal. :)\n\nAnother Update: This Game Blows. I have never been so on the fence.

It's unresponsive and clunky. What I mean by that is this: you'll be in the middle of a big spoon curve, or coming out of a tight turn, and you wanna stay on that good line by evening out your steering at a spot that sets you up to get where you're looking to be on the track. But the game gets in your way. No matter how lightly you tap the thumbstick, your car will steer heavily in that direction. This results in out-of-control fishtails if you're aggressive in trying to correct the issue, or a trip into the grass/gravel/wall if you try to let it even itself out. There's very rarely any middle ground, and when I did nail it, it felt like luck, like the binary steering system just so happened to have a "notch" that put me where I was trying to go. This is an issue regardless of stability control or braking assistance settings, as I tried it all four different ways.\n\nIt's not as noticeable with less powerful cars, but the more powerful the ride, the more glaring this issue becomes. The AI doesn't seem to have this problem. About the only way to consistently avoid it is to hit the brakes, slow to a crawl, then creep around the curve, at which point the AI either blows by you or rear-ends you.\n\nConsidering this is a game about the joy of driving cars, and the driving part of it is so flawed, save your money for something better. Even at $5, I regret my purchase.","June 16, 2015","false","2.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Another review says the game is "a great blend between arcade and simulation". I can't believe I listened for a single instance. Right out of the box I had to get into the controller xml file just to fix the steering WHICH WAS STILL BAD AFTER THE FIX! That's unacceptable for a racing game. The cars handle like crap and so does the driver AI, they might as well replace the drivers with lock on missiles because screw it, the other drivers are going to hit you just as well as any guided missile a game dev could throw at you.\n\nI want to honestly know where the developers got their idea of how a vehicle controls, have they ever driven a vehicle? Do you guys know how a car actually behaves on the track or do you just drive your little Prius to work and used that as your basis for understanding? Controller dead zones shouldn't be set as high as they are either. I shouldn't have to tap the stick continually full tilt just to go around a corner, I should be able to just angle the stick and cruise around it. I doubt they even bothered to tamper with the controls, they were probably too pressed for time by EA and just said "Screw it, we'll still get a paycheck".\n\nI feel cheated out of my money and if I could get my money back I would but due to the Steam user agreement that I agreed to I can't.

Lots of cars, generic yet fairly extensive car upgrades, great looking tracks and vehicles, etc.\n\nBut unfortunately this game is one of the buggiest games I've bought in a very long time.  Dampening is enabled by default on all controllers, so controls suck real bad unless you edit some config files.  Max graphics settings are missing in the UI, so when I set reflections on "max" it says "_LOW_" instead, while the rest say "_HIGH_".  Using AA of any kind instantly crashes me when I try to join tracks.  And all AA is shader based.  Forcing msaa or ssaa through gfx card options will get you nowhere (except quickly back to desktop after a crash)  You have to uninstall physX and reinstall an old version, just to keep it from crashing constantly.  Spark animation sources never dissapear sometimes, leaving a random continuous shower of sparkles cascading onto the tracks.  Car information doesn't reflect the vehicle at all after certain car upgrades.  Leaves keyboard icons up in UI when using a controller instead of showing you which controller buttons actually manipulate the UI,  ... I'm getting kind of bored writing all these.

The graphical style is outstanding, and I say that because without the use of extreme filters and such like Need for Speed Rivals for example, it still pulls of a rather impressive appearance if a bit dated (It did come out in 2011, after all).\n\nYour car lineup covers a number of cars across almost every popular brand out there save ferrari and a few others, but I will admit the variety of cars from each manufacturer is rather low in comparison to its main competitors on the console market out there. However, each car feels unbelievably well detailed and simulated, and while it is possible to get this game on console as well you are going to want it on PC due to the fact that this game feels like it was DESIGNED for PC, not console.\n\nThe enviroment is really what gets you though. Other racing games are effectivelly nothing short of boring menus until you start a race. This one gets that soundtrack, enviroment, gets the sounds down perfectly on each car and area, the camera angles right, helps you to feel motivated to get out there and kick ♥♥♥.\n\nThis is a game I highly recommend to racing fans out there. Even today, it stands up very well. Just be careful of the premature patch issued to this steam version if you don't know what you're doing - you actually might want to get it on disc or origin in this case, believe it or not.","May 18, 2014","true","0.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

For me, it is a good balance between the two. I absolutely loved the first Shift and eagerly awaited this sequel. IMO, it did a good job of expanding and improving the many greats about the first one, while still managing to up the ante and introduce some new things. One of the biggest improvements individuals will notice after playing the first one is the way you upgrade the performance of the vehicles. If you've played Forza 3/4, then this type is oh so familiar to you.\n\nThere is now a much wider range of performance options instead of the tried and true Tier 1, 2, 3 formats. In this you are granted with pretty much any aspect of the car you could think of upgrading and giving them all to you off the bat, the strategy is finding that sweet spot balance of parts to give you the edge, without going over the performance rank (A, B, C, D etc.), which is what races are locked to, or going over your budget.\n\nThe physics are neither the best, nor as detailed as games like Forza or GT, but the damage and handling models are pretty stellar IMO. As I said previously this is not a full blown Simulation racer. This game is pretty deep as far as modern racers go these days so that’s good and I expect the average person to get a good solid 30+ hours out of just the single player career alone.\n\nThe AI in this game is quite comical sometimes and makes for some random comical relief. I normally play all my racing games in the highest of difficulty and even on "Hard" you will sometimes not too uncommonly see an AI opponent going full throttle in a straightaway and not even brake for the oncoming turn, leaving him careening off the track and slamming into the wall at high speeds leaving an explosion of parts and glass flying everywhere, or slamming into you or another AI opponents read end at full throttle, causing them (or you) to make like a space shuttle into the barricade. Sometime's I think they program to AI to do such nonsense to show off the physics engine haha!\n\nHowever, this is nowhere near a perfect racer by any means and comes with its laundry list of faults that is for sure. Some of the most annoying are: The randomly crazy handling, grazing another driver often leaves you defying the laws of physics, by careening you off the map or putting you into an uncontrollable spin even tapping an opponent in the right spot at relatively slow speeds and at times wired input lag. This also happens just grazing a wall or similar object, which will leaving you scratching your head at how just barely scraping the wall at 40 MPH, sends you into a uncontrollable 1080 degree(3 rotations) spin...\n\nAside from that, the drifting in this game is absolute ♥♥♥♥, no thanks to some of the issues mentioned above and thankfully you can just skip that portion of the game entirely, other than the tutorial you are forced to do. Shift 2 still suffers from the dumbed down money system where after a few levels you have more money then you know what to do with and can max out every car you buy with ease, this kills some of the "I worked for this" feeling, or struggling to get that next little upgrade to give you more of an edge.\n\nShift 2 no longer has that "Obviously best car in the class" problem that was in the first Shift where there was that one car that was leaps and bounds better than the rest of the cars in that class as far as performance went. With the addition of a horde of new cars, quantity of cars and classes and the Performance Index system, there is now a whole new level of strategy in picking and choosing the best cars and parts to suit your gameplay, while still staying in the Performance Index rating.\n\nIn the end this is a decent console port with everything else being truly satisfying. Good deep racing scene with multiple disciplines, sometimes seemingly endless amounts of races, character leveling system, good customization esp. for performance parts and The graphics which I know most put a lot of emphasis on are decent, not as good as say Grid 2 etc., but still good eye candy in Ultra settings.\n\n\n8/10","March 22, 2014","true","26.4"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

For what i experience, NFS Shift handling is more good than this one from this aspect. But it doesn't mean it's not fun at all! Really good environment and cars detail, good racing experience and AI, amazing soundtrack make NFS Shift 2 enjoyable.\n\nGraphics (8/10)\nA bit annoying particles and dust on the screen, like no realistic at all, particles is not real time, the cars is like hovering in the dark place with no light source.

And that might be the case but for any race outside of drifting the slow input ruins everything. You have to turn well before you're on the turn and you'll have a hard time correcting if you don't judge correctly. The lag issue is a game killer for me. I'll stick with Race 07 and the other games I have. And for those who read other reviews where people talk about learning the lag and getting through it.

This doesn't happen just once but for every single new type of race you'll try.\n-  There's an extreamly tedious and obnoxious guy who tells you how awsome he is and then explains to you what a muscle car is, like if you never seen one before. And you can't skip this either.\n-  Because this is published by EA you'll get all that stuff to, bugs, annoying online system, tutorials that never end, PEGI 3, etc.\n\nDoes it seem like I'm exaggerating? Well I don't.

On its own, the game has a host of unique features and problems as compared to its competitors (especially of those on the consoles.) Then compared to the original Shift game, it also made some improvements but cut where it shouldn't have.\n\nBut let's start with the basics. This is a simulator racing game. Or at least, that is what it is classified as. If you are wanting an open world experience with pursuits, save yourself the heartache and look at just about any other Need for Speed title because this game has none of that. This is a game that tries to create professional races with opponents that are about evenly matched with you as possible.\n\nSo how does it do to that? Well, again, it comes in with a mixed bag. No, I can't honestly say that this is the most accurate game possible, but it isn't going to let you off with bad driving. In true Need for Speed fashion, the car list feels rather small and this time around we have a lot of repeating cars. Customization is a bit hit or miss as while we finally have engine swapping with the more specific engine parts to upgrade (not to the point of realism though,) there is still a linear upgrade in body kits and the vinyl designing seems to be even worse. At the very least, all cars can be upgraded with Works. Thankfully, tuning can be either simplified or extremely technical while also allow saving different settings for a given car for each track. Yep, you can have a special setting for the short, technical track and a different one for those at higher speeds and the game will automatically switch out based off the track and layout.\n\nThe gameplay is where the game begins to shine over others though. Traffic is actually a thing as smashing your way through opponents is a bad idea over trying to (almost) safely weave through them. Night racing is absolutely wonderful and I have yet to find another racing game that tops it as while well lit tracks don't bring much issue, unlit tracks like the Nürburgring become a lot more difficult (and almost scary) to drive with not always being able to see around the corner. AI can also be fairly aggressive but not to the point of cheating or actually being unsportsman. If you play with the camera on dask or on helmet, the race feels more intense as it bobbles around like you are in the car itself, making even a quick run around a track by yourself in a low end car feel more intense than others with AI drivers with high end vehicles.\n\nThe helmet cam is also a new feature to this game (that will probably leave due to things like the occulus rift.) The camera will look into the turn like a professional driver. While it takes some getting use to at first, it is well executed and does end up becoming quite helpful especially in larger vehicles but probably not needed for triple monitors.\n\nAll of that said, Shift 2 is a fairly good place for people to try and break into the simulator genre. The game has a level system based on what you do and mini-achievments per race, meaning that just because you have a hard time winning doesn't mean you can't progress to the end. While different from the previous Shift title, it still does the job well at letting new players still get a chance to eventually move on but without being a hinderance to veterans of the genre.\n\nNow, how about against the original Shift? Well, more improvements and new issues. Yes, night time racing is a wonderful feature, helmet camera is appreciated, and the improved graphics are wonderful. But they have removed the unnamed crew chief who started the race for you with a real world professional driver. And yes, you will know that the new person helping you is a professional driver. And yes, it becomes a nusiance. No, Shift 2's new guy doesn't have an annoying voice but that it feels like he is lecturing you for every single race instead of seeming like you are part of the same team. We go from a grassroot driver becoming a legend to a grassroot driver who is forever in the shadow of his teacher. And then they brought in the rest of the real world drivers. Yep, every boss race is you against a real world racer betting their car against you. No weakness and they are not that interesting especially when almost all of them are driving a car sponsored by EA. I get that they might be trying to create buzz for the drivers, but this isn't a good way to get me excited for them.\n\nAllow me to wrap this up. Wanting a typical Need for Speed game? I recommend Hot Pursuit by Criterion. Want a super realistic simulator? Might be worth your time. Just want a fun yet fairly challenging racing game? This is probably up your alley. Looking for the proper sequel to Shift? Prepare for disappointments and be pleasantly surprised at certain points.","November 26, 2013","true","6.4"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Of special note are the brake and steering assist - which always get me all mixed up in because I can´t tell what I do and what the computer does, and sometimes the assist does some really awkward stuff. So I turned that stuff off very quick.\n\nI´ve played on keyboard extensively, it has this weird steering delay worked in and it obviously can´t tell the difference between `steer right a bit´ and `steer right´. This makes controlling high performance cars impossible, and on high driving difficulties the only cars I got to steer somewhat decently was low performance stuff with a heavy focus on steering. You just cannot handle the oversteer (and wheelspin)virtually any car throws at you with a keyboard. The keyboard also starts out with really weird key settings and I recommend changing them to something more sensible ASAP (menuing also uses weird as hell keys)\n\nSo I bought an XBOX 360 controller. And the controls suddenly worked like a charm. Seriously, if you´re going to play this game, having at least a controller is a must.\n\nSomething that´s very important to mention, I think, is that SHIFT 2 is horrendously unstable. I get random crashes, and the game simply always crashes to desktop on certain races, and tracks. It´s appalling, and in my opinion enough reason to not buy this game at all.

Bold statement as Shift 1 was widely praised for splitting the franchise and moving into the racing sim genre, breaking away from Need for Speed’s arcade roots. But it wasn’t quite there. Shift 1 was a prototype for the formula, testing what worked and what didn’t. What definitely didn’t work were the physics and handling. Floaty, unresponsive and still clinging to the series traits. An EA inclusion more than Slightly Mad Studios, as the UK developers were definitely capable of more precise and realistic handling based on their earlier GTR games.\n\nHowever, the cockpit view was an absolute blessing and Shift 2: Unleashed drastically improves the handling to match the visually stunning cockpit view.\n\nGameplay\n\nShift 2’s cockpit view is the best and most visceral experience I’ve ever seen in a racing game. Not only is it highly accurate and detailed, the cockpit also features amazing effects. Wing mirrors shake at high speeds, vision is blurred at those speeds, the dashboard is reflected on the windscreen, shifting, handbrake and pedal actions are all intricately animated, dirt flicks on to the windscreen, rubber and gravel ‘marbles’ hit the undercarriage and wheel arches and high speed crashes cause violent shaking, temporary loss of vision and heavy breathing from the driver. Also the option to have a helmet camera further emphasises the impact as well as the precision as the head sways towards the corner direction for added realism. The third person camera offers the chance to view the detailed cars from behind but it doesn’t offer the connection the player has with the car as the camera is a bit too floaty, I like that word, making it hard to aim for the apexes.\n\nLuckily, the improvements in handling have made it much easier to point a car at an apex. Turning off all assists, except ABS and Automatic (c’mon now), produces the most rewarding driving experience in a racing game. Throttle control is vital as well as judging the braking zone and corner angle all to get the best exit creating intense racing. Immersion can be broken however by the slightly over-aggressive AI drivers who have no problem PIT manoeuvring you off the track or blocking you on straights. A little more Jenson and little less Pastor would’ve made a less frustrating battle for 1st. This is tied to the fact that Unleashed doesn’t have a rewind feature made popular by Codemasters and now prominent in the Forza series. Thank God though, as racing intensifies in the latter stages making it a white knuckle ride to the finish line without a safety net.\n\nCareer progression is improved above and beyond Shift 1’s silly star system as well as the XP rewards being based on good driving rather than awarding careless racing. Videos by real-life racers and drifters such as Vaughn Gittin Jr. introduce each racing category and you are provided the opportunity to learn and hone the skills before heading out on track. Need for Speed fans are also given extra cash and cars for their dedication to the franchise, which helps save up cash to buy their dream cars. Unlike Shift 1, to race a car in Hot Lap mode, you have to buy the car in career mode. Perhaps unfair, but it gives a real incentive to finish gold in every race and manage the cash in order to afford the cars you really want. Helpfully, cars can be sold for the price bought making it easy to sell the lower-powered sports cars necessary for a category in order to save for a hypercar.\n\nThe car list is smaller than GT5 or Forza 4, but it ignores the unnecessary hatchbacks and endless Nissans of the GT series. The cars here are focussed racing machines and monstrous production cars all with beautifully detailed interiors and exteriors with moving airbrakes and wings. Not included are any Ferraris but the Porsche selection more than makes up for it. The diverse variety of tracks features all the greats such as Suzaka, Silverstone and Spa as well as an interpretation of the Monaco GP circuit.\n\nTechnical\n\nThe sounds are loud. My headphone volume was at 50% most of the time and sometimes lower at night. The cars sound great though and the noticeable differences in sound from the cockpit view to behind the exhaust demonstrate the attention to detail that Slightly Mad paid. The graphics are impressive not just the cars but also the track surroundings, including helicopters and planes flying over whilst racing. Night racing is also a welcome addition with tactics having to alter and slight apprehensiveness when approaching blind bends. The ability to turn off HUD whilst in-game is also a brilliant addition as you can have the lap times and positions when you need them and turn them off to not obscure the view without breaking the flow of the race.  The framerate could be improved though as modding was the only way to uncap the 30fps limit.\n\nVerdict\n\nTurn off assists. Stick it in cockpit view and go RACE.\n\n90%","July 4, 2014","true","60.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/startrekmike/recommended/47920/","startrekmike","startrekmike","http://steamcommunity.com/id/startrekmike/","210 products in account","I got this game in hopes that it would be something of a Forza for PC. The car selection looked good, the track selection was not terrible but sadly, this is not really a product I can recommend, especially for those looking for a more serious, mature and functional experience.\n\n1.) The intro video's are too loud, To the point where I had to go in the config files of the game to remove them so that they would not blow out my headphones every time I start the game. Minor annoyance but still worth noting.\n\n2.) Very unstable. This game will crash when loading tracks, it will crash in the middle of races and there is very little that one can do about it. I had to actually reinstall the game entirely (verifying steam install did not help) to make a certain track even load without crashing.\n\n3.) Really poor controls for the gamepad. This one took me by surprise, I would have thought that a game like Need for speed would be extremely controller friendly but sadly that is not the case. The cars feel floaty and unresponsive. There also seems to be some input lag that I can't really explain, it's a common issue that many complain about and for good reason (especially after enjoying the fantastic controls in F1 2013 and GTR2).\n\n4.) Unskippable intro videos to different race types during career. This is where the maturity falls through. When you select new race types, you are greeted with one of two (or three) "edgy" racing guys telling you how extreme they are and how much they love speed (and whatever else) while they describe the basics of the race type. I would not make a big deal of this but it is unskippable and their "personalities" are grating and immature at best. It's almost embarassing to watch.\n\n5.) Rather silly race structure. Like other NFS games, you can't do a qualifying lap, you just start the race in whatever grid position that the game randomly puts you in. This is frustrating because you are usually faster than the AI (more about the AI next) and not having any means to compete for a grid position takes away control that you should really have.\n\n6.) The AI is pretty awful. When you play a game like F1 2013 (or any other very realistic racing game), you will find that the AI is usually pretty conservative about risks, they won't crash into you and they won't try run you off the road. In this game however, the AI is really not out to win as much as it is out to make sure they crash into you and with the handling and physics the way it is, almost every collision (no matter how minor) will result in you spinning off the track or into a wall. This may not seem like a huge deal, you may say "get good" but you will understand once you see just how needlessly aggressive they are.\n\nI don't often like to trash games and write negative reviews, I usually try to find the silver lining in any product that I purchase and while there are moments that I really do enjoy this game, it's overall quality leaves a lot to be desired and I will certainly not buy another NFS game in the future.\n\n","January 2, 2015","false","17.7"," 19 of 38 people (50%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","50","19","38","5","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/0NickM0/recommended/47920/","0NickM0","FuzzyB00T","http://steamcommunity.com/id/0NickM0/","275 products in account","As far as I'm concerned, this is a very poorly done console port. The keyboard keys are bound to impossible keys, in game mechanics aren't optimized to PC, and the AI is poorly done, not to mention the fact that the game crashes often on high graphics.\n\nBefore diving into issues, i want to dive into a major issue with this game: The long, unskippable in-game movies that can't decide which volume they want to be. For starters there's the intro movie, that gets incredibly loud, and is only skippable after all the logo's displayed. These don't read into your personal volume preferences though, and are extremely loud, which is especially annoying when you play with a headset. Then, there's introduction videos that introduce you into a certain "event". These can be cool, but you need to be able to skip them. If you're hyped up for a race beforehand, a 2 minute long movie can only get you out of that hype. The fact that you actually have to delete the movies out of your data map, is a ridiculous thing in it's own. Now that that's out of the way, on to my major flaws with this game.\n\nMy first issue with this game is the horrible standard controls that the game asks you to use. This would be with the arrow keys, and the insert / delete button to shift gears. And yes, you use the up arrow for throttle. A controller of sorts makes the game easier to handle, even though this also isn't perfect. You can control in-game fully with a controller, but as soon as you enter any menu, including the pause menu, you are forced to use the keyboard. Especially when in-game this is a very poor point, given that you have to sit ready with your controller already in your hand, before pressing either the enter or escape button on your keyboard.\n\nMy second problem lays in the fact that a lot of the in game mechanics aren't optomized for pc. Left and right scrolling through the main menu goes with the arrow keys, while sub menu's always go with either U and I, or J and K, depending on what you want to do. The customization mechanic is sensitive beyond believe, and isn't, like most of the game, controllable with a controller, making it virtually impossible to line stickers up. Most of the engine / steering upgrades are standard, and it is clear that EA has it's favorite cars that are being favored. Some of the works cars (which are supposed to be the maxed out performance cars) are so horrible, that it's impossible to control on a circuit.\n\nFinally, the poor AI. I find myself having to reset the track about 15 to 20 times, especially at the beginning,  to be even able to race in a fair matter. More often then wished, i find way too many cars bumping in on me, and spinning me out of control, making it impossible to even have a fair chance at winning. When I instead try to do the same, the cars seem to be magnetized to the track, and are unable to even get off. It's like bumping into an almost static object, sending you spinning, or even flipping out of control, but AI driven cars are completely fine. The most that the AI will do for you, is try and steer about half a meter clear from you, so that you can try and clear a corner. But more often then not, they still bump into your back and send you spinning.\n\nThat being said, I don't think the game is entirely just bad things. There are some positives, the cars generally look awesome, and there is some fun to be had in multiplayer, or attempting to break the AI in a race. If you are successful, it's definitely worth the effort, and you could get some laughs out of that.\n\nI wouldn't say the game is worth the full 20 euro's that are currently charged, but wait until it's on sale sometime. 5 Euro's is about what the game is worth, in my opinion.","January 12, 2015","false","40.6"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

Alas i did not give up and leave the game alone, I purchased a proper racing wheel, shifter and pedals only to find that it didn't not work well with a new wheel setup. Playing something like asseto corsa to this, this horrendous piece of excrement, they simply should have spent money on something worth while like sacking all of the useless idiots they employed to create this. Also kudos to steam for not refunding anyone after 2 hours of play, really...bravo! As always why do we need some racing driver from the states claiming he knows racing because he can 'drift'.

They are similar but slightly better compared to Shift especially on the vinyle quallity. The surroundings on the track are not the greatest but it is hard to notice when you are gunning it down the track at 180 MPH. The car detail is very nice and the paints look very pretty. For me at least the game runs fine but every once in a while when starting a race it gets ♥♥♥♥ing slow for a few moments and goes back to normal. Other than that it performs great on my PC. I'd give it a 9/10 on graphics/performance for a game from 2011.\n\nGameplay\n\nWell for one the gameplay is totally different from Shift. They took the realisim up a notch on the way cars feel and handle compared to Shift. Drifting has also been made way different compared to Shift and is actually quite hard for most people. Overall the game is probably 2 times as hard as Shift was. The customizing like in Shift sucks just the same with no paintable wheels and hardly any vinyles to apply thus making it impossible to make your own liveries. This makes me feel forced to use the pre made liveries that look bad IMHO which leads me to just paint my cars metallic blue and be done with it. The vinyling system was definatly improved since Shift but they removed a great number of vinyles and made 90% of them only one colour. The AI can be annoying at times especially on small, tight tracks as they will push you out of their way in a hairpin making it almost impossible to win. I'd give gameplay a 8/10 only because of the crappy vinyling system.\n\nOverall\n\nOverall this game is fun and challenging making it very entertaining for me. Nothing beats blasting around the Nordschleife in a 1986 Toyota Corolla AE86 with over 800 HP. If you like racing simulators, buy it. If you like cars, buy it. If you like drifitng, buy it. If you want your Vette to handle like a Lotus and be fast, I'd run and never look back.","June 25, 2014","true","94.1"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

I want to enjoy but theres so much wrong with it, and just like every other EA game it has a couple fatal flaws in it that just RUIN the gameplay. The NEGATIVES are that the steering has this huge input delay that becomes more relevant the more you play, as you will try to steer only to not steer hard enough or way to hard and just send yourself swerving off the track. The game is also really hard, that and im bad at it, on top of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ controls. The ai just seems like if you aren't in first place at the very beginning, you wont be able to pass the ai in first. Not to mention all the other racers can just ram you ar send you off the track and wreck your car and send you to last place like your a ♥♥♥♥ing ragdoll. Then when you try to ram them you might as well be trying to move mountains. Oh and i should mention another thing...THIS PART IS IMPORTANT IF YOU ARE CONSIDERING THIS GAME. I had frequent problems of it crashing because of...well i never even found out what but i tried fixing it for 2 hours and the damn thing still occaisionally crashes, which just turns me off of this game especially after all the other things i mentioned.\n\nBUT WAIT. THERE ARE SOME POSITIVES.\nOk so i know ive beaten on this game quite a bit but there are SOME positives. Compared to shift 1, this game has alot more cars and makes the car list from the first one look pretty dismal. The cars and customization are also pretty cool and cool to drive (well...apart from the steering as i mentioned earlier) and the sounds and graphics are also pretty awesome. But i find when i crank my graphics to the max the game crashes (weird) Idk if this is because im using amd radeon r9 270 and this game is made on all that nvidia bull ♥♥♥♥.besides it being fustrating AF to play, some of it is pretty cool, but i cant exactly recommend it because alot of people would feel as though their money was wasted. But if its really cheap or comes in a racing pack (which is how i aquired it) then its not SO bad. But if you want to play a shift game maybe you should play shift 1 instead(?) or at least first because this one definetly takes some getting used to.\n\nCONCLUSION\nWell i know i ratted on this game alot but its partly because im frustrated. Its honestly not THAT bad, like there are worse racing games you could play (that you could buy on steam) I guess its worth a play, at a cheap price, i only "dont recommend" this game simply because of what i mentioned above and because some people might not be able to get past its plaws, which i can understand because were all different, but at the same time others probably can. If i had to rate this game it'd get 6/10 or so.\n\nif you managed to read this far or all of my review then thank you, and also congratulations, thats a pretty wordy and boring review. i just hope it helped out","January 31, 2015","false","9.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

After that you remember that it is another EA floater that someone forgot to flush down the toilet.\n\nPROS\nGreat visuals (tracks, cars, and even cockpit interiors all look good)\nVery customizable cars with advanced tuning features brought back from some older NFS titles\nVehicle damage is great and somewhat realistic (but sadly no total carnage from a serious crash)\nCONS\nThe "pep talks" from Vaughn Gittin before and after the races make me want to jam a sharp instrument into each of my ears. I appreciate that he's a drift champion, but listening to his drole, useless commentary over and over makes me wish he was never born.\nThere is a significant and noticable delay in the handling for all the controllers and wheels that I tested with this game. You basically have to turn early to compensate for this painful delay or you will end up in a wall on every corner.\nThe interface, like so many other EA titles, is a Frankenstein's monster patchwork glued together from console versions. As a result, the menu navigations are nonsensical and tedious. As an example of this: you cannot adjust controls and sensitivities during a paused race; instead you must exit the race, go all the way back to the first menu, change the controls, then start the race over again.\nThe EA autolog is forced down your throat and completely useless. It slows down load times and will often cause the game to hang indefinitely during a track load if you do not block it with a firewall.\nThe AI, if you can even call it that, will often mistake the race track for a demolition derby. They will slam into you when you slow for corners, clip your tail and spin you out, and all sorts of other shennanigans unrelated to racing and with no fear of disqualification. Likewise, you can slam into them and generally wreak havoc without any fear of disqualification, so go nuts! My favorite is when two AI side-swipe each other in the first corner and then slow to a stop as they both try to turn into one another.\nThe intro sequence for each race always seems to have frame stutter and audio clipping regardless of video detail settings. But then the races go by without any frame issues on high details.","December 11, 2015","false","11.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","0"

While I would recommend this game, I do so with some caveats, which I will list in the cons.  The most important point people need to know is that controls have to be customized heavily, I used an Xbox 360 controller for windows and the stock settings were awful, however I followed some guides online and tweaked a couple ini files and was good to go.  Here is the guide that was helpful for me setting up controls: http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=2270539\n\nPros:\n- Lots of races\n- Good variety of cars\n- Most cars look great and have great interiors\n- AI makes mistakes on occasion, even knocking themselves out of the race\n- AI will bump into you more if you start driving dirty\n- Difficulty Levels and driving assists really let you tailor this into either a sim racer or arcade, I like it closer to sim but not all the way there and played with no damage, driving assist line, medium AI, elite handling mode and all driving assists turned off.\n\nCons:\n- Crashes (not the kind you'd expect, in my 75+ hours I've probably had about 30 crashes to desktop, sometimes losing progress, particularly maddening on endurance races).\n- Ignored/Lost progress bug.  I noticed this when doing the last drag races, often times the race results screen would show up twice and I would lose all my progress and have to repeat the series, very annoying but after 3 tries on each of the last standing mile races I was able to get through.\n- Challenges like the modern A invitational can be difficult because you are provided with a car and not able to tune it for the track (makes for a frustrating experience at times).\n- "Cut the track" bugs.  Perhaps I'm misinformed but on a few tracks if you go too wide on a turn (understeer) into the grass and then come back to the same turn it would say "you've cut the track!".  I call BS on that, I thought cutting the track was when you took a shortcut through a turn on the inside grass, not the outside.  This was infuriating on one particular track where following the ideal race line would put you into this situation on purpose, even with just two wheels off.\n- Other general bugs, none of the "videos" unlocked even though I completed the career stuff for them.\n- Not enough levels, Max level in game is 20, after that you keep earning experience but it goes nowhere.  I hit level 20 by 45% career completion.  Why build levels in at all when they end that soon?\n\nAll in all, this was a fun experience and I recommend it to anyone who enjoys a racer that helps bridge the gap between simulation and arcade.  8 / 10","July 4, 2014","true","75.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I have spent almost 10 hours of game time trying to fix it, and now I cannot even refund my purchase. It was the worst $30 I have ever spent. What is worse is that EA has literally no regards to this game anymore. They dropped support for it and now so many people are experiencing crashes around every corner(pun intended). Steering wheel and pedals hardly work because I can't adjust the sensitivity, dead zones, etc, in detail, so if you have a wheel, it is probable that support for it may be dismal.\n\nPerhaps the console version of this game is better, but the PC version is unbearable.

Some cars have glassy handling making them completely undrivable, this wouldnt be so bad if some of the challenges didn't require you to use these cars.  I enjoyed the first NFS:Shift more than this one.\n\nThe announcer is unnecessarily irritating.  Also, I dont need to see a unskippable cutscene of the car im driving before every race.\n\nThere is a bug that even after closing the game Steam continues to think the game is still active.  I have to force close Steam before I can launch another game.  I've racked up 200+ hours of time while this game has not actually been active.\n\nThe only thing good about this game is driving the Pagani Zonda R around the Nurbergring. However, it takes way too long to earn the money to buy it.\n\nI will be more than happy to permanently retire this game when Project CARS comes out.","January 31, 2014","false","244.9"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","5","12","0","0"

Force feedback is numb, and the upgrade system only includes go-fast bits instead of handling goodies (unless I just didn't earn enough levels to unlock them in my brief time with the game). All of the handling and braking seems to be handled with settings that are not unlocked when you first get started. There is no tire selection. There is a nitrous button. This game has elements of a good racing game, but misses hugely in too many places, numb feedback probably being the worst of it all, as it makes driving difficult.","September 5, 2013","false","8.6"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","4","10","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/neoligisticintel/recommended/47920/","neoligisticintel","neoligisticintel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/neoligisticintel/","140 products in account","I had high expectations for this game.\nA notorious series for it's fun, unrealistic racing games moving into more simulated racing experience? It sounds like it could have potential to me, but then I bought it and I, a fan of racing games of this genre, hated it.\n\nDon't get me wrong, the graphics are top-notch and the scenario of the game is also brilliant; something that many games of the same genre lack and need overall in my opinion, but the game itself - physically - irritated me.\n\nThere is an imput lag within the hame, and whilst it is only small, overall, it affects a racing game moreso than most. The time that it took for the responses to take action ruined the whole experience, as I was unable to make corners in time or brake at the exact right distance from the corner, whereas in other games it would have been alright. A higher powered PC than mine might be able to handle it, however, the problem seems to affect a large amount of the audience that play the game.\n\nThe physics also annoy me. They are so light, it is almost like someone has attatched a group of helium baloons to the cars as so they float. This would be okay, I guess if not for the juiced-up, ROID RAGING, AI drivers, of whose sole purpose is to shove you off the track. Some may see this a being "Fun" and "Well Programmed", however, I can see that the opposite cars are meant to follow a ceirtain track and do not adjust that as so to avoid you down straights and corners, making them hit you if you go inside of the corner fairly - I'm not talking about rusing into the corner as so the others hit you, but coming into the corner in line with another racer, of whom shoves you out of line for no absolute reason other than for them trying to follow a direct path through the corner, of which is interrupted. Bad coding is the reason for this, I would presume.\n\nFinally, the last thing that annoys me is the modes. They would be fine in any other game, but in this game speciffically, they do not work. Drifting is the equivalent of spinning out until a path is found, of which you repeat for a while before the game notices and gives you an amount of points equivalent to a small amount of drift, as the mechanics of picking up on drifts are basically broken beyond belief. The races, coupled with bad AI and physics are unbearible and the drag events... well, they were ok, actually, you dont turn, just drive in a straight line. If only there were more than three of them.\n\nOverall, this game is bad in my opinion, but strangely infatuating to return to, even though you know you will have a bad time. Why I have been on it for 17.5 hours is beyond me. I would not get this If I were looking for a racing game at all. I would instead resort to the internet looking for sim racers. I found a good Free to Play one recently called SimRaceWay, of which is worth a look, it is much better than this game to many a regard.","October 13, 2014","false","17.5"," 3 of 10 people (30%) found this review helpful","30","3","10","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/requios/recommended/47920/","requios","Requios","http://steamcommunity.com/id/requios/","246 products in account","This game is not about perfectly recreating how cars drive in real life, it's about the driving experience. Races are intense. You feel the engine, you feel every bump in the road. If you cut off an opponent in a corner, he will notice and the next time he is in front of you in a corner, he will try to cut you off. This game is what it says: "The most immersive racing video game experience to date".\n\nThe helmet camera is an extra step in this immersive experience. This is the only racing game I know where you actually play the driver, instead of the car. You don't look straight ahead all the time, you look into the corners. My only complaint with this camera is that it sometimes rotates too much, especially when approaching a sharp corner. It also restricts your view quite much, which wasn't a problem for me, but if it could be for you, there is always the other camera's: in front of the car and third person behind the car.\n\nAnd just a note: this game isn't really playable with a keyboard. Get a gamepad (or a racing wheel), otherwise the input lag is unbearable.\n\nIf you want true realistic racing, then look somewhere else. If you want something even more fun than that, an intense racing experience, this game delivers.\n\nUpdate: After posting this review, the game started crashing at the loading of most races, at a point where it is unplayable. I have tried reinstalling, verifying and all sorts of tricks, but the crashing does not go away. Until I've figured out how to fix that, I sadly cannot recommend this game.\n\nUpdate 2: For some reason, a few days waiting seems to have completely fixed the crashes. To my knowledge I haven't changed anything, so unfortunately I cannot help if you have a similar problem. However this means that, although warily, I can recommend this game again, yay!","November 27, 2014","true","14.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Due to that I never took place in a real race seat it's just a small and maybe unimportant feeling that I have about it.\n\nI played a lot of NFS Games, some of them were quite funny and challenging, some as Carbon, Most Wanted 2012 and Nitro were more like a stop-doing-that-thing kinda game. Shift 2 Unleashed is absolutly a YES in the NFS series - IF you like to have a challenge. Keep in mind that it is a simulator-near game, with options to make it easier for you.\n\nThe career mode is well designed and - for me - well balanced. The amount of cars is great, the money and experience system is also great. You will face a whole load of upgrades and tuning possibilities depending on the installed upgrades. There is even a function to tune your car for a specific track - which is damn great.\n\nIn case you enjoy good and less-arcade racing games, Shift 2 Unleashed is a DO.","July 3, 2014","true","52.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A few cons that I had with the game were the inability to skip cut scenes. Not a huge deal but I had to reinstall the game a few times and they got old quickly.  Which leads to the other issue I was not able to complete this game due to the fact that it kept crashing on certain races and I could not at the time find any support articles to remedy the situation.\n\nWhile i do recommend this game.

Just bought it yesterday for 5 dollars and have to say its well worth the money. I've always been a forza guy but when it comes to the pc this is about the closest your going to find. But like all games there's pros and cons about it I would like to mention below:\n\nPros:\n-Stunning graphics and great settings for tuning them to fit your pc\n-Great selection of cars with many upgrade features\n-Fun selection of tracks that you can play day/dusk/night\n-Nice multiplayer feature, but hardly anyone on anymore :/\n-Driver settings for beginner drivers to help get used corners and braking\n\nCons:\n-Can be pretty difficult to play with the keyboard. I would definitly reccomend a controller but a steering wheel/pedal setup if you really wanna get the full experience.\n-Pretty boring in game soundtrack, and dosen't seem to play when racing? Have to use a background media player if you don't like hearing an engine for 20 minutes straight.\n-Some might not enjoy having to create an EA account to access multiplayer and other features. Not required to but kinda pushes it on you while you play.\n-No rain or other weather. Would have been nice in my opinion.\n-The painting feature for vehicles don't offer many options on styles. Same goes for decals.\n\nSo is it worth it? YES. And in case your wondering if it will run on your computer don't worry I'm currently maxing everything out with a resolution of 1920x1080 using a GTX650ti getting about 40 to 50 FPS, maybe 35 when there's more scenery.\n\nDon't waste money on a 30 to 60 dollar racing style game. Put 5 to 20 down on this game.\nYou will be happy and have extra money to get goat simulator.\n","May 4, 2014","true","6.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Critical50/recommended/47920/","Critical50","Someasianguy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Critical50/","165 products in account","I gave this game so many tries, and everytime I'd get annoyed at the stupid AI. After seeing how all the recent releases for racing games all seem to be major dissappointments, and NFS: Prostreet being pretty much unfixable, I came back to this game. I decided to stick with the game. In my previous review I gave it a thumbs down because the AI can get incredibly annoying..you'll be slowing down on a corner and the AI hits you and sometimes makes you spin out. I know Im not going slow because a lot of times I'll be up on my opponents bumper. But after a while, you learn how to avoid AI and keeping your space. Then it gets to be a pretty fun game. There are some pros and cons, some of them kinda conflict with each other.\n\nPros:\n-There are different divisions of ranking for cars. This prevents you from farming races over and over until you have a super fast car compared to the competition, and you wipe the floor with them. Ranking works depending on what the car is initially, and then any performance mods you make. This includes things like tires, brake pads, clutch upgrades, turbochargers, engine swap, etc. Forcing you to put more thought into your car build rather than simply buying the most expensive stuff available.\n-Engine swaps. No, you cant put a LS1 engine in a Miata. What you CAN do is something like\nTake a Toyota Corolla AE86, swap in the V6 Supra engine. Swap in a 20b 3 rotor engine into an RX-7, RX-8, or even a Miata. So they have to generally be from the same company. Not all cars have engine swaps available. I was able to put the NSX V6 engine into an S2000. Since Acura is Honda.\n-Manual transmission option. Something devs dont seem to get that many people want nowadays.\n-Pretty nice car variety.\n-Gorgeous graphics, for its time.\n\nCons:\n-Annoying narrator. Too upbeat. Thankfully you can mute him in audio options. Set dialogue to 0.\n-The different divisions and ranking does have a negative to me, and that means you cant do things like take your classic car like my 20b Mazda RX-7 up against modern cars. Or my Skyline powered Fairlady 240z.\n-Physics at time feel a bit dated. But it is an old game. Doesnt mean I dont enjoy it.\n-As I said in the intro, AI does sometimes ram you off the track. I could be nearly done with the race, finish line right there, taking this tight hairpin turn, and some AI goes too fast around it and sends me flying off course. Then 3 cars get ahead, and Im no longer in the top 3.\n-Customization is really limited. Yes, no one is going to see your car but you and maybe a few people, but the possibilities with customization took such a leap backwards. NFS: Prostreet let you choose between so many vinyls, and rims. I could spend such a long time just customizing cars in Prostreet, but theres not much at all to do in Shift 2, its almost pointless.","November 6, 2014","true","29.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","2"

It's about half as good as GT.  It's certainly not a bad game, however, I have two main issues.  The first is performance issues: this game struggles to run at decent frame rates, and busy parts of tracks have noticable dips in frame rate.  The second is AI:  the opponents have a tendency to spin you out by nudging your rear end sideways.  It happens in almost every race, so you need to get away from the pack as soon as you can, otherwise you will most likely spin out of control.\n\nThese two issues have stopped me from playing so much more of this game, hence only 14+ hours played in over a year.\n\nI would suggest doing research on other equivalent racing games before making this purchase.  Although I do recommend it when on a strong sale discount.","January 8","true","15.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Yes, it does have many sim-esque elements and handling but the cars ocillate faster than my vibrator, every road is made of oil, there are no qualification laps, the AI has been surgically removed from Burnout, and the full body awareness is wasted because EVERYTHING TURNS BLURRY AT THE HIGH SPEED OF 20KMPH. If you want to enjoy this as a racing sim, forget it. If you really do want to play this game, then be prepared to download a handling/material mod and some stuff to remove the blur (which will leave the game lowering the detail of the dash anyway because it assumes its still being blurred). Also be prepared to play disconnected to the internet, period. The only way to prevent the game from crashing at all is to disconnect your computer from the internet, because the beautiful piece of work that is autolog decided to drop a deuce into the game every time it references lap times. Its never getting patched. Its so badly done that BLOCKING THE APPROPRIATE PORTS DOES NOT WORK.\n\nYou still want to play? Well, the game is quite fun, if only for that out of control experience. Since you have the option of ruining your suspension and strapping a giant turbo on something that can't handle it, you can go the full ricer experience.\n\nPlease don't buy this.","April 18","false","10.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","2"

I actually thought this would be like NFS: Pro Street (a sort of Gran Turismo-like NFS if you haven't played it) but according to the dev, it was the most sim-like NFS.\nI'll start by saying that the game feels overall empty: Nearly never music (I could live with that), poor amount of cars (I could forgive that), but a very horrible driving sensation.\nFor a game that is labeled as a realstic game, I was both shocked and dead laughing when a message asking me to plug a controller poped when I was trying to play the drift mode with my steering wheel. Like, really? A sim car that ask you to unplug a steering wheel to plug a gamepad?\nNow it's not as if the normal races where better. You feel like your car behave like nothing you've ever driven: the steering lack of precision and is the most "floaty"steering I've ever seen in a racing game, not like the overall behaviour of the car was salvaging anything as every car seems to understeer as if you were driving a 18 tons truck, to the exception of when the game actually decides that it's time to make you feel like you oversteer.\nThere's really not a single positive thing I can say about that game. Even at €1.00 I think it would be a waste.","June 4","false","7.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
