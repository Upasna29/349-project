And I’m okay with that, because it’s a lot like being disappointed in a great-tasting meal that was just too small. Small enough (yet so tasty!) that you’re left wanting seconds immediately after finishing, but the kitchen has already closed for the night.\n\nFirst the good: The locations you can explore look amazing, from the sunny beaches of California to the tumbleweed-laden deserts of Nevada, each area feels unique and even beautiful. I’m a big fan of attention to detail in simulations, and I don’t just mean including famous landmarks. I mean the little stuff like run-down shopping centers, signs for divorce court and cheeseburgers, and speed traps laid by highway patrolmen with nothing better to do. As an American, I think they did a great job nailing down the feeling of driving here, down to the idiots who don’t know how to use the fast lane on the highway and the bizarrely high number of self-storage buildings. The weighty, believable physics simulation and driving model are back in action as well, making great use of everything from a keyboard, to a gamepad, to a top of the line force feedback steering wheel setup. Quite simply, it’s everything I expected from SCS Software and their penchant for higher-quality than you might expect compared to similar simulations.\n\nSo why am I let down? It’s a combination of minimal changes made and a lack of overall content. ATS uses an enhanced version of the engine used in ETS2, although at first glance it’s hard to tell any difference. You’ve got the same menus, the same UI, the same controls, many of the same sound effects, and so on. The biggest change arrives in the form of new locations to explore and new trucks to purchase. And by that I mean two states and two trucks: the states of California and Nevada, and the Kenworth T 680 and Peterbilt 579. That’s it. The cities are far more detailed and interesting than in ETS2 though, and there are licensing issues preventing more trucks at the moment so that makes sense. But still...\n\nI find myself hesitating to fully recommend it on launch. I’m still so hungry for more that it’s bothering me, and I would’ve much rather waited a few months for a more complete game. Ignoring that and giving SCS Software time to add more stuff, and I’d absolutely recommend this one. Even if it feels like a preview right now, the taste of things to come is scrumptious, and I can’t wait to dive into more as it arrives!","February 2","true","14.8"," 1,028 of 1,263 people (81%) found this review helpful 90 people found this review funny","81","028","1","90","24"

People who've played ETS2 will pretty much recognise what they're doing and where to find things due to the game being made using the same engine. If you're new to the Truck Simulator franchise however, you'll find that this game is actually quite fun. The environments are beautiful, the cities are very big and there's a huge variety of roads such as ones that are long and narrow and ones that are more difficult to navigate. If you've played ETS2, I'd say wait till this game is on sale. If you're a newcomer, well worth your money!\n\nNOTE:\nAll of my reviews are laid out in a particular format that fits the game.\n\nAbout\nAmerican Truck Simulator [ATS] is a spin off to the popular game, Euro Truck Simulator 2 [ETS2]. Just like the title says, you'll be driving around two of America's states, California and Nevada, in a truck. Since ATS was made using the same engine as ETS2, there are a lot of similarities, most notabley the UI. Just like It's previous games, in ATS you start a company in which you make deliveries for other people to earn money. The more money you get, the more you can upgrade your warehouse, and get drivers to work for you. That's basically it.\n\nGameplay\nAgain, gameplay for this game is a lot like ETS2. If you've played ETS2, then this game shouldn't be difficult for you at all. If you haven't played ETS2, It's not hard to get into basics. There are differnet modes for controls, some which are more difficult than others. Just like ETS2, there are radio stations where you can listen to music, you can customize your truck by adding different paint jobs, there are different camera views to view your truck from different angles and have the basis of any other vehicle such as headlights, indicators, windscreen wipers and a horn.\nBut as I mentioned before there is added detail to ATS. One thing for example is police cars. Police cars pretty much act as moving speed cameras. If you break the speed limit and/or do something that's illegal they'll fine you, plus turn on their sirens and just sit there.... watching you.\nCities and towns are much bigger than the ones in ETS2. There is now an actual good reason to travel through cities and admire the views.\nThe map in this game is pretty disappointing, I've already discovered at least 80% of it. Yes I know, they're adding a free dlc soon that adds Arizona, but right now, the map is small.\n\nDesign & Graphics\nI would say there is a slight better quality when it comes to graphics & design that ETS2.\nATS isn't a hard game to run when it comes to graphics. Just like it's predecessor, there are plenty of graphics options. I can easily run Ultra graphics, so I'm assuming it isn't that hard.\nOne of the main things the developers were working on this game, was design. The game has much more detail than ETS2. There is much more of a variety of different roads. cities and towns are much larger and are more detailed and there are some really beautiful views. Sometimes at night times you can see shooting stars, and in day time you can easily see planes and jets flying around.\nAlso I swear I saw a UFO in Nevada...\n\nUI [User Interface]\nLike I said before, the UI of this game is pretty much Identical to ETS2's, pretty much nothing has changed, which in most ways is a good thing. If you've played ETS2 then you won't have any trouble on getting to understand where everything is. As for newcomers, just like in the previous games, there are tutorials that tell you where everything is, so I doubt there will be a time where you struggle.\n\nPros - Beautiful Environment\n- So much detail!\n- Very relaxing\n- It's pretty much what you want in a truck game.\n- Much bigger towns and cities.\n\nCons - Such a small map.\n- Very similar to ETS2.\n- Some background terrain looks very bland.\n\nFinal Recommendation\nMore of a reskin, than a unique game. People who've played ETS2 before would probably find this a bit disappointing. But from my experience I've enjoyed playing this. There is much more added detail and many beautiful places to explore, even if It's a small map. Just like It's predecessor, It's a relaxing experience, thats what's important to me.\nIt isn't perfect, and It's definitely not better than ETS2, but It is worth your money.\n\nFinal Verdict - 7.5/10.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ficMiV3AfuE\n\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/270880/\n\nIf you liked this review, be sure to give it a like!

I don't know a lot about trucks, or about trucker life, or about running a trucking business. But American Truck Simulator still appeals to me. Driving along a highway making a delivery while listening to some music, listening to a podcast or watching a twitch stream/youtube video is very satisfying and relaxing, however its debatable if what is available here is worth the price(I'll argue both points of view)\n\nYou're given 2 states, and 2 types of trucks at launch. Thats all you get. Granted, more will be available down the line, at launch its a very small pick. You're going to see the same landmarks several times just by playing about as much as I have(A little over 6 hours at this point). You're also going to be doing a lot of the same thing, especially if you don't get a loan early on and just do Quick Jobs like I've been doing. However, if the gameplay thats given is satisfactory enough, I could forgive it, which is is in my opinion.\n\nHowever, if you've played a lot of Euro Truck Simulator 2, I would recommend you wait on this. There isn't much of a change at all, its basically a well made expansion pack to ETS 2. If you're looking for more of that gameplay with a new environment, $20 might be a fair enough price, but if you're on the fence, wait. I'm sure it'll be on sale a few months down the line, and I'm sure they'll be more content at that point. But I do think its worth the $20 purchase is worth it if you haven't played Euro Truck Simulator before.\n\nThe gameplay is nice and relaxing with some light management gameplay tacked on for good measure. Its absolutely worth $20 for me, but I think most people will want to wait.\n\nWait For A Sale","February 3","true","9.4"," 268 of 331 people (81%) found this review helpful 20 people found this review funny","81","268","331","20","10"

ATS is practically the same game with new trucks and scenery.\nIf you played ETS2 you know exactly what to expect. It‘s literally the same, even the menu is the same. But i don‘t consider that a negative thing, though some things could‘ve been improved.\nAfter the ETS2 graphics upgrade the game looks gorgeous. ATS is no different, it looks great. Developers put a lot more work into scenery and cities. The American environments never gets old and is always nice to look at and the cities feels alive and real.\nThe game core didn‘t change. You must drive from pont A to point B and deliver various goods. There are only three trucks in game so far, but it‘s enough for the start, and they‘re badass American trucks! There‘s only two states for now – Nevada and California, you will drive through them in no time, but it feels developers have put more work into them than ETS2 Europe map. Scandinavia DLC looks much better than default EU map, and ATS looks even better than Scandinavia. So i‘d rather have less but quality content than more but shallow and bland.\n\nThe game is only 20€ on steam, so you kinda get what you pay for. The more content will be added through DLC and this is one of those rare games when i wait for DLC because i know these developers will not disappoint, they want to make the game better and are always looking for ways to improve their games.\nAfter ATS was released the steam workshop was added to both games. People were asking for it for years and finally these amazing developers done it. Thank you. Now applying mods is as simple as clcking the mouse button.\n\nWhat i think should be improved is physics and force feedback. The physics feels too arcadey, i know developers are doing their best, but for a new game they could‘ve improved physics. Also Force feedback could use some improvements. But overall driving feel is good.\n\nGraphics are nice and all, but not having anti-aliasing in this day seems a bit stupid huh? I know maybe it‘s because engine limitations or something, but it‘s really not my problem, AA is a must! Other than that performance is inconsistent. I'd say the game runs worse than ETS2, but it also looks more detailed.\n\nThere‘s nothing more to say, if you liked ETS2 you‘ll like this one. Just start the engine, open a beer and drive trough beautiful American scenery.\n\nPros:\n\nBeautiful to look at\nCities are big and feel real\nSame relaxing gameplay\n\nCons:\n\nNo anti-aliasing\nPerformance issues","April 27","true","18.3"," 113 of 129 people (88%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","88","113","129","4","7"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nanachan/recommended/270880/","nanachan","Nana","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nanachan/","42 products in account","Having come from Euro Truck Simulator 2, ATS offers some great new features, but too much is lost for those craving the feeling of a long journey.\n\nSummary\nATS is a big technical step forward compared to ETS2, with an awesome improvement to the graphics and some very welcome tweaks to the gameplay. However, the excessive map compression results in many undesirable consequences that forces you to drive aggressively. My impression of truck driving is managing the weight carefully and smoothly, and this is not something the current game mechanics allow. The driving experience itself is underwhelming due to "head movement"  effects of the in-game camera being heavily nerfed. Overall, it adds up to breaking the immersion of driving a heavy vehicle with massive momentum, over long distances across the vast, open plains of the USA.\n\nThe Good:\nMore detailed cities\nBetter and more immersive road textures\nVery subtle variations in color tones used for surrounding scenery, giving it a more realistic look\nParking difficulty can be adjusted\nFar better optimization than ETS2. Scaling can be upped from 200% to 400%, and no weird stutters that plagues ETS2 since v1.21 (Test system: i7-4770K, GTX770, 16gb RAM, SSD).\n\n\nThe Bad:\n1:34 map compression compared to 1:19 for ETS2. While the larger size of the USA warrants more compression, the current solution was far too aggressive.\n\nAs a result:\nCompression results in short highway on-ramps\nAlso results in highly compressed time, and if you get stuck in traffic at an intersection, your delivery will be late.\nTherefore forces you to drive pedal to metal up to the speed limit.\nCompression also results in abrupt speed limit changes, and you'll easily get fined with the aggressive policing in-game. Combined with the less visible speed limit signs in the US, you are forced to use full, emergency-level of braking to slow down and avoid fines.\nThe roads also have bends with compressed radii which requires abrupt steering inputs.\nThe sense of a long journey is gone as there is much reduced "cruising" that made ETS2 so magical and relaxing.\n\nAlso, while American trucks are bound to be much more stable than cab-overs, the game lacks the sensation of side-G forces when going around a corner. Taking a 90 degree turn at 30mph felt foolhardy in ETS2 but in ATS, the truck turns, dead stable as if it's on rails. The current driving experience behind an ordinary single-monitor PC setup feels similar to an early release of ETS2, without all the enhancements. Most notably, the head tilting camera effect to make you "feel" the truck around corners is nerfed so much that you really lose the sensation of movement when cornering and braking.\n\nClosing Comments\nATS is indeed fantastic for those wishing to hop in, drive fast and explore. A good number of players have the desire to finish  a long haul job quickly in one 30 minute sitting.\n\nOn the other hand, for those who want an intimate experience with truck and scenery, then I would recommend ETS2 instead. It gives a better feel of acceleration, braking, the changes in the engine tone and vibration. Plug in free map mods and you'll have a complete experience with the scenery. I fall into this category so I therefore cannot recommend ATS.","February 5","false","21.2"," 555 of 786 people (71%) found this review helpful 47 people found this review funny","71","555","786","47","40"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/eviljackcarver/recommended/270880/","eviljackcarver","EvilJackCarver","http://steamcommunity.com/id/eviljackcarver/","119 products in account","I picked this up the day after it came out, and have been playing it off and on since my new HDD came in - so far I'm liking what I'm seeing. Please bear in mind this review is coming from someone who came from Euro Truck Simulator 2, and while I've tried to avoid comparisons between the two, they're inevitably going to crop up as I type this.\n\nI'll divide this into 4 sections: The great, the good, the bad, and the ugly.\n\nThe GreatHere's what I felt was executed masterfully, what I feel there's little to no way to improve upon what's already in the game:\n\n- Believable damage implementation. There's no collision deformation, sadly, but as your truck becomes damaged, more and more things start happening - neglect your engine and it'll start to fail mid-trip, neglect your gearbox and you'll lose the high gears.\n- Very immersive. It's easy to lose yourself in this game. Put on a radio station or a podcast, and relax.\n- Easy to mod. The game makes itself easy to mod, and has a large and active modding community as a result. If you type in "American Truck Simulator" into the search engine of your choice you'll see at least ten websites dedicated to mods.\n- Trailer parking system gives you a choice in difficulty. Upon arrival with a load, you almost always have a choice in where to park the load, with 3 options - generally, a more difficult one that requires backing up, an easier one where you just pull straight in, and an option to skip.\n- Decent trailer variety. One of the things I noticed in ETS2 was how there was really one major variant to most trailers, excluding liveries. With most trailers here, there's a short variant and a long variant.\n- Towns on the map actually feel like towns. Unlike in ETS2, there's actually commercial and residential districts in the towns across the map - it doesn't just feel like a giant industrial district.\n\nThe goodHere's what I felt was done well, but had room for improvement:\n\n- The map is rather detailed. You can tell that someone spent a lot of care working with the map, and it doesn't feel at all like a bunch of pre-fabricated areas cut and pasted together. Some bits don't make much sense, however, such as a burger stand without a parking lot, or a giant sign advertising a hotel-and-casino sitting in front of a motel parking lot, no casino or hotel in sight. Scaling feels a bit awkward as well, a good example is on the Cali 58 southeast of Bakersfield where there's four sudden hills one after another - fun, yes; but a bit unrealistically close together.\n- Weather effects are pretty nice, but limited. It's mildly disappointing waking up in 'Frisco and not seeing the Bay's thick fog over the Golden Gate Bridge, or not seeing the wind kick up a dust storm out in the Nevada desert sometimes.\n- Policing system was reworked from ETS2's. There's actually patrol cars that'll drive around the roads, that act as speed cameras on wheels. If you speed near them, they'll turn on the lightbar, and you'll get a citation. You'll see a few parked on the side of the road running radar here and there, as well. However, the amount of police cruisers patrolling the streets is absurd, especially on the freeways where you can have three patrol cars one after another. They also bear a generic CHiP livery, which is a bit bland.\n\nThe badHere's what I felt rather disappointed by - not enough for me to feel a rework is in order, but enough for me to want to complain about it:\n\n- The game feels very unfinished. When it came time to release, there were all of two trucks. As of me typing this, there are three - 2 Kenworths, and a Peterbilt. Customisation is rather limited, and it seems overlooked. If you look around in the options you'll find keybindings mentioning beacon lights (no such beacons exist yet) and in the lighting adjustment you'll find options referencing auxiliary lights (which also do not exist yet). Also, at one on/off ramp in Elko, there's redundant traffic signals facing the wrong way on the ramp. Although several modders have ported in customisation items from ETS2 that render most of the previous sentences moot, it still feels as if this game is little more than a beta at this stage. (You'll note I did not mention anything about what states the map does or does not include.)\n- Passing zones on back roads are few and far between. Seriously - there's very few places where you don't have the double yellow line that isn't right before an intersection - I'm not from California nor Nevada, but I know that here, at least, unless you're coming up to a blind hill or corner, or an intersection, there's a passing zone. Mildly frustrating when you're behind an underpowered truck doing 20 below at the start of a long straight section.\n- The traffic's AI is a bit screwey sometimes. They'll wait to signal a turn until they're a car-length away, they'll pull out in front of you to turn right at some traffic lights (especially bad when the speed limit's 55), and - my biggest nitpick - when they're turning right on green, they'll stop at the light, pull up a bit, stop again then make the turn - bad news for a driver not expecting this.\n- Road signage nitpicks: If you're unfamiliar with the roads you're on, speed limit changes occur without warning - especially, in once case, a 55 to 25 drop. (Note: In the previous example, it's fairly obvious the reduction is coming if you look at the GPS; however 55 to 35 drops are fairly common.) I don't know if it's done this way in California/Nevada, but down where I'm from, sudden speed limit changes are announced a ways beforehand with a sign reading "REDUCED SPEED AHEAD" or a sign with the speed limit on it, with an arrow pointing forward (think the "YIELD AHEAD" signs in-game, but with a speed limit sign instead of the yield triangle). Road work signs are posted a short ways away from the construction site, not all of 25 feet before.\n\nThe UglyHere's the (thankfully only 1 major) things I felt was done horribly:\n\n- Weigh stations give little to no warning. The major killers here are the two on IH-80 in Nevada, where the speed limit goes up to 80 and you have a chance to get up to speed. Here, it's rather rare for AI trucks to get going that fast, so I'm usually in the inside lane overtaking the other trucks. The notification is set so close to the weigh station, you have 5 and a half seconds at ten under to decide whether you have enough time to get up to speed, pass, and get into the weigh station, or whether you need to brake and drop back, try and squeeze into the spot between the truck you're passing and the car behind it, and slam on the brakes to make it into the weigh station. This isn't an exaggeration, either - I was in an underpowered Kenworth T680 passing a truck with a tipper-trailer when I got the notif between Truckee and Reno, and just barely had enough time to brake, squeeze between him and the cop behind him, and pull into the weigh station - if I'd have taken a half second longer to react, I literally would have missed the off-ramp.\n- The purpose of coinsurance is not well explained. I might have just missed it, but all I knew was "it would be paid separately" (said when I bought my truck) and that it shows at the bottom of the diagnostics page.\n\nClosing notesAll cons aside, if you're a diehard fan of ETS2 and want to support the company like I did, it's worth the twenty bucks.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/el_kemosabe/recommended/270880/","el_kemosabe","El Kemosabe","http://steamcommunity.com/id/el_kemosabe/","1115 products in account","Welcome to the USA! Well, two of fifty states…\nAmerican Truck Simulator is SCS Software’s latest bafflingly enjoyable trucking simulator. ATS is effectively ETS2 with a few improvements and new locations, in the form of California and Nevada for you to explore with Arizona coming as a free update at some point. The map scale in ATS seems to be smaller than ETS2 and while that does mean you get around faster it also means that you can’t have long journeys like you could in ETS2 which is also contributed to by only having two states. ATS has only launched with two trucks but there are a couple of others ready to be released once licensing has been sorted out by SCS with more trucks in the works, all of which will be free updates.\n\nATS is certainly a good looking game and it boasts visual and performance increases over ETS2. Both trucks are well-designed and look great, especially with the shiny paint jobs and the scenery all looks good too. The towns and cities also look good but due to the map scale they feel pretty small, with the exception of Los Angeles which is relatively big for the game. The UI and menus are all the same as they were in ETS2 and are still just as easy to use as they were. The new trucks have come with some in-cabin differences, namely an electronic display and a built-in GPS. Both of these have several display modes to choose from which are all pretty helpful.\n\nBeing a trucking simulator, ATS’ gameplay consists of hauling cargo from one company to another between cities. One of the new features in ATS is ‘special’ destinations for cargo which will depend on what kind of cargo you’re hauling, for example if you’re hauling construction equipment you might have to drop it off at some roadworks just outside one of the game’s cities. On the topic of new features, weigh stations are also new and you’ll sometimes receive a message to pull off and have your truck weighed when you’re passing one.\n\nBack to the actual cargo, while there’s not as much variety as there was in ETS2 with DLC there are still enough cargo types to keep things interesting. As was the case in ETS2, unlocking certain skills will also give you access to new kinds of cargo such as flammable liquid or high value construction vehicles. The maximum trailer lengths have also been increased up to fifty-three feet whereas ETS2 had a maximum length of forty feet. These longer trailers can provide quite the challenge, especially when you’re dealing with tight turns.\n\nATS also lets you build up a fleet of trucks and drivers to bring in extra income for you. While early on you’ll probably need bank loans to buy new trucks, once you’ve got yourself established expanding your fleet will become far easier. Despite the fact your hired drivers can only earn up to ~$20,000 per job, having a form of income other than the jobs you’re completing yourself is incredibly handy, especially if you have loans to pay off. Garages to house your fleet are available across both states currently in the game and start with three truck slots with an upgrade increasing that to five. While you do start with your own garage it only has one slot available which is occupied by your truck so you’ll need to upgrade it to three slots before you can hire new drivers. The trucks purchased for your drivers can be upgraded/customised, just as your own can, and you can also switch around your trucks whenever you want.\n\nUpgrading and customising your truck is one of the main areas where ATS is inferior to its predecessor. Right off the bat, only having two trucks (that’s not two manufacturers, that’s two single trucks) massively limits the customisation though each truck does have a couple of different presets though they aren’t unlocked until you’re a higher level and levelling up takes quite a long time. Customising the actual trucks is also pretty underwhelming, most parts of the truck only have two or three different options, such as bullbars, and some of the options that were available in ETS2 simply don’t exist anymore, such as a beacon. Hopefully this will improve once SCS has sorted out more licensing but for the time being it’s definitely one of game’s negative aspects.\n\nThe other main problem with the game is the map scale I mentioned earlier. A twenty in-game hour journey now takes somewhere in the region of thirty of forty minutes, depending on whether or not you’re in-line or below the speed limit. While this kind of scale would be acceptable if we had access to the whole US, when you consider that a twenty hour journey is pretty much the longest possible journey in the game’s current state it’s pretty disappointing. Of course, if you do prefer getting your jobs done quickly then you may actually like this but I feel like most ETS2 fans will be somewhat disappointed.\n\nOne last thing I’d like to touch on is just how relaxing the game, for the most part, is. Just cruising through California and Nevada with your favourite music or podcast on is incredibly enjoyable and relaxing, perfect for after a long day’s work or after you’ve been playing something a little more stressful. If you don’t have any music or podcasts to listen to, you can try out the game’s default internet radio stations (or even add your own, instructions available in-game) which feature a wide variety of music genres. The game does have some music that plays if you don’t have your own stuff but that only plays in the menus and loading screens. I did say the game is relaxing for the most part, the other part there is when you’re involved in some kind of traffic accident or you get hit with a speeding ticket when you’ve only just entered the new speed limit zone, while incredibly frustrating they don’t happen all too often so you should be nice and relaxed for most of your time in ATS.\n\nVerdict\nATS' current amount of content may be disappointing but the game does improve on ETS2 and will be enjoyed by its fans. If California and Nevada isn’t enough for you I’d suggest holding off on buying ATS until the Arizona expansion is out but otherwise go for it, the game’s pricing is reasonable after all.\n\nLone Ranger Reviews.\n\nEl K.","February 7","true","46.5"," 160 of 214 people (75%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","75","160","214","17","15"

And beside all of that it is very well optimised that low/medium PC specs can run it on ultra settings.\nI can't write of actual gameplay impressions at this time because of limmited content, therefore I will edit that part on later date.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CowmanII/recommended/270880/","CowmanII","Cowman","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CowmanII/","1420 products in account","THE GOOD:\n-Game is graphically great, everything looks as good or better than ETS2. You should be able to run this at the same settings as ETS2. You can also copy over your configs from ETS2. Just go to *\Documents\Euro Truck Simulator 2\profiles\###### and copy all the .sii files then go to *\Documents\American Truck Simulator\profiles\(same #### as ETS2) and paste them in there.\n-Gameplay is just as fun as ETS2\n-Trailer dropoffs are more varied. You can have them do it for you for no bonus XP, "do it safely" which is an easy dropoff and gives you some bonus XP or you can do it for real which is usually difficult for 40-90XP. There's an option in the menu to just choose one but you can always have them park it for you or change the dropoff point if it turns out to be too hard.\n-There's a huge amount of environmental pieces and NPCs. Driving through the desert you'll see tumbleweeds rolling across the road, helicopters flying by, airplanes and even military jets zooming over, parasailers, blimps and just so many little details that keep things interesting and keep you looking around for the next little detail.\n-Devs are dedicated to it and have promised support for a long time. They did the same for ETS2 so I have no doubts they'll continue working on this.\n\nTHE BAD\n-Game is limited right now. There's only California and Nevada along with 2 trucks. SCS has promised to continue adding states and they're working on Arizona right now. There's licensing problems with the trucks but they'll add in more as they get that sorted out. This will no longer be a problem in the future but at least both states have a lot of road and detail it still feels small.\n-Traffic AI is really bad. Lots of cars/trucks driving straight into you without braking or caring. While it is a realistic depiction of American drivers, it makes for very frustrating gameplay.\n-Police are harsh. America doesn't have a bunch of speed cameras so instead they added in random police cars that will ding you for going a few over the speed limit. Some people have said that it seems like the police are more lenient on highways and stricter with backroads which might be true but I haven't verified this. It's a good new system but extremely rough on new players.\n-Fines are huge. $900 for speeding. $800 for running a red light, even if you stop a bit late but aren't blocking traffic. Once you get some money flow coming in it isn't a big deal but it's hard on new players. It was the same thing in ETS2 however with the new police system it's a lot easier to get ticketed for speeding so it racks up fast.\n\nOverall, it's a fantastic game and to put it simply it's an improved version of ETS2 but set in America. There's only 2 states and trucks at the moment but there will be more in the future. It's well worth the $20 asking price and will provide just as much entertainment and fun as ETS2 does.","February 3","true","25.1"," 78 of 115 people (68%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","68","78","115","11","0"

It also completly changes the map for simulation games. When I first heard of ETS2, I thought it was a crappy knockoff. Until a buddy of mine, who hates driving games, recommended it to me.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nouyorus/recommended/270880/","nouyorus","Luca","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nouyorus/","241 products in account","EDIT: Adding a bit more, some upsides I have seen and a bit of a new format.\n\nLet me preface with this: I am going to continue playing it, and seeing how it changes, and more than likely this review won't stay solely negative over time if there's considerable changes, and as I put more time into it.\n\nPros:\n- It's in the US, where I'd argue that a "trucking culture" is a bit more ingrained compared to Europe\n- The cities look fairly accurate\n- You get a choice of how you want to park when you get to a destination (hard, easy, or skip)\n- Weigh stations are interesting, if minimal at this time.\n\nCons:\n- Feels very small in the current state\n- Highways, while I don't expect perfect accuracy, are not quite where they should be.\n- It's almost Euro Truck Simulator repackaged with a new map, and therefore some things don't really mesh between the game and how things would actually be done in the US.\n\nI really want to like this game. I've actually driven trucks up and down California and Nevada. I know the places I am going to. And for that reason, I have to say 'no' to this. It's not a content issue, or a graphics issue. It plays like Euro Truck Simulator, and I am fine with that.\n\nMy biggest qualm comes from how everything is laid out. Yes, I know liberties must be taken if they are scaling things down so that they can fit everything, but everything just feels too small. You cross the SF-Oakland Bay Bridge into Oakland from I-80 and you're immediately greeted with a port in the middle of countryside. Do about thirty seconds of driving on a flat country road and you're at I-5. Try as I might, I can't find the real world comparison to what they are trying to show. Donner's Pass, which I had actually looked forward to seeing done in game, didn't feel like it at all. It was a small incline, small decline, and another small incline, and then I am in Truckee, immediately after getting on I-80 at Sacramento. Having driven Donner's many times, it's hardly anything of the sort.\n\nThe biggest concern I have is the scale. Yes, $20 isn't a whole lot, and if you like simulation games you'll probably like this. My issue is that the shrinking of everything to fit within a playable timeframe (who really wants to sit on hundred mile desert road with nothing for hours, if you haven't driven over the road for real) is causing a loss of some realism and the actual routes in the area they are supposed to be simulating. It's hard to call it a simulator when it feels rushed in that sense. Maybe it'll be fixed in the future, and I hope that's the case.\n\nAs a secondary, seeing the two trucks it comes with plus the addition of Nevada added as a "DLC" concerns me that every state and every truck is going to be just another micro-transaction to fully enjoy the game. I figure that won't be the case, but it has that feel about it. Frankly it seems like the 'game' is just a DLC in of itself, with very little actually available on release. Perhaps I am from a bygone era, but when a game is called "released" I would think it'd be complete, barring expansions or other little DLC that we know of today. I know the company is small, so I don't expect miracles, this is just a concern I have at this moment.\n\nNow, that's enough of the negativity. There are upsides. I wouldn't still be playing it if there weren't. Having been to most of the cities currently depicted in game, I can say that most are fairly accurate in appearance, both in skylines if there is one and the general appearance of the streets if those are depicted. San Francisco was about as accurate as I could expect when you're pressed for space, and Reno looked and felt almost as I recall it.\n\nIf nothing else, I can say that I enjoy the parking selection above all. It's easy to just do the driving down the highways and what not, but the parking selection gives you something to aim for, complete with increased experience for the harder ones. The harder parking, usually, isn't too hard though and in most places it's worth giving that a shot.\n\nAs far as a game goes, I can say it's nice to have a game set in the US revolving around truck driving. As stated above, the US has always had its trucking culture, and the relative fascination around it. Despite that, few games (that I am aware of) actually aim for a semi-realistic approach to driving in the US. For now, I can say that for the most part it does the job well enough, and I can't say I expected too much different.\n\nIn short, yes, buy it if you're into things like this. If you're looking for a really hardcore simulator, I'd pass. I hope things will be fixed in the future since this is only day one of release, but at this moment, I find it lacking. It feels less like a game and more like just a DLC. As it expands and is worked on, I'll probably be able to recommend it. If you want to support the developer, I'd buy it to show it's still popular.  Overall, I like it, I just can't in good faith recommend it in the current state.","February 2","false","8.7"," 513 of 851 people (60%) found this review helpful 22 people found this review funny","60","513","851","22","15"

Deliver for so many company's and prove your skill by challanging reverses.\n\nFeaturing realistic rain effects, and a strong physics engine.\nMultiplayer mod is a whole new division by the friendly team at "Truckers Mp" (Not related with SCS Software) Perhaps build or join a trucking company (VTC) or just truck around with friends ussing in game chat! Attend massive convoys that are all over the map. Fully Wheel campatible which takes you it a whole new would, just like a real trucker, shifting through 18 gears (G27 Shifter).\n\n*Positives*\n\n- Very strong physics engine\n- Well thought out\n- Well recognised landmarks with neatly done city's\n- Fully licensed and overwhelmingly well detailed trucks!\n- Good ai\n- Lots of new things\n\n*Negatives*\n\nUnfortunatly lacks realistic road physics, but still good.\n\nI strongly reccomend this brilliant game! 10/10","April 12","true","418.0"," 55 of 79 people (70%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","70","55","79","4","2"

So what have they done well and what's new to like? They've done a remarkable job capturing the American feel of small towns, large cities, surrounding countryside and the AI vehicles. The detail that has gone into the local businesses is terrific. Graphics are excellent and on par with ETS2 with a slight improvement in texture quality. The game runs stable with not so much as a single crash or hiccup in 14 hours.\n\nIt's also nice being able to drive American trucks and trailers, and is a welcome change of pace from the Euro HGV trucks. There is a new parking option I like when delivering loads that you can gain extra XP if you put the trailer exactly where the customer wants it or in certain places. It sort of harkens back to the challenge of the dangerous drives of Scania Truck Sim or Truck & Trailers though on a much smaller scale. The world feels alot more alive with NPCs that actually are busy doing stuff instead of just standing around and many other little details too numerous to mention.\n\nThat said is there anything else not to like? Nothing really bad but it falls short in a few areas that I had higher hopes for:\n\n1. Sound - While the truck sound effects are adequate, some are recycled from ETS2. The engines sounds are just okay but inaccurate, engine brake is far too muffled and the air brakes don't sound anything like the Kenworths and Peterbilts I see everyday with their brash loud blasts of air, rattling diesel engines and jake brakes so loud you nearly soil yourself if you're next to one.\n\n2. Weigh stations - This is another new game mechanic which sounds good on paper but adds little if anything to the game. I'm not really sure what they're trying to do here but after nearly 14 hours of playtime I've been required to stop at two weigh stations and nothing happened either time so it doesn't add anything significant that I can see.\n\n3. Game size - The game world is small compared to the initial release of ETS2 and of course with all of the ETS2 map add ons, SCS has a very long way to go to catch up. It took a long time for them to just create two states and months for Arizona which still isn't available. It makes one wonder if they'll ever get the entire continental USA.\n\n4. Only two truck brands to choose from which is a real bummer. While I'm sure the licensing will be worked out eventually for other brands, they could have at least released them under ficticious names, assuming they're finished with the modeling. We really need to see Freightliner, Mack, International and Western Star to name a few.\n\nIn summary I give it a recommendation to hard core sim fans, SCS fans or trucking fans but more casual sim fans might want to wait until the game matures more and more content is added.\n\nOn to the big three things most people look for in a game I'll give the following ratings:\n\nGraphics - 9/10\nSound - 6/10\nGameplay -8/10\n\nOverall - 7.5/10","March 15","true","43.8"," 36 of 50 people (72%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","72","36","50","0","2"

The game as it is now is already excellent - the world, although maybe a little small compared to Euro Truck Simulator 2, seems far more detailed and far more alive than some of the parts in the base ETS2 map.\n\nOf course, the game engine is pretty much the same and it will feel very familiar to ETS2 users. There are, however, plenty of things to enjoy in ATS - from challenging deliveries to long open roads, not to mention those great American trucks.\n\nWith California and Nevada in the game at the time of writing this review, the world can feel a little small. In my current 33 hours of gameplay I have visited all major towns and have explored over 75% of the map, something which would have taken far, far longer in Euro Truck Simulator 2. On the other hand, with a free Arizona update coming soon and the promise of significant map expansions through DLC, American Truck Simulator is only going to get bigger and better over time.\n\nThis is a great single player experience, that can also be enhanced through multiplayer play with the Truckersmp mod which is easy to install and free. If you are tired of driving around California and Nevada on your own, join up with some friends and join a convoy!\n\nTL;DR\n\nA great single player and multiplayer experience that promises to get even better as more content is added to the game by developers. Well worth it for people who enjoyed ETS2 - it is more than re-skin and it is also a great introduction to those who sneer at or have not had the pleasure of enjoying truck simulation.","March 24","true","44.1"," 40 of 57 people (70%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","70","40","57","8","0"

No more careless speeding between speed traps.\n- Two new American trucks. Two is also the total number of trucks you can drive in the game at release. Read it: 2. TWO.\n- New traffic models, replacing European cars with American ones.\n- Some minor parking tweaks.\n- It has helicopters, blimps and crop dusters flying around. Crop dusters are cool.\n- It has weigh-in stations, which are basically the same annoying toll booths, but you don't pay.\n\nThat's it. That's the exhaustive list of innovations. ATS has the same interface, the same progression, the same skill system, the same loan system, the same messages, the same tutorial, the same graphics (it doesn't look better than ETS2 at all), even THE SAME MENU MUSIC. Everything is the same. Except it's in America, and with fewer trucks.\n\nThis is a very well done, very pretty, and very expensive (all things considered) OFFICIAL MOD for Euro Truck Simulator 2.\n\nGet it if you're okay with more of the same in new, less diverse environment.

The performance seems optimized but that's it, nothing new was introduced. Still terrible A.I / shimmering effect on fences / poles / anything vertical.\n- The A.I is still the same terrible one from ETS2\n- No "open window" feature despite many requests over the years\n- No "smoke" on trucks, something umbelivable since 18WS had smokes 10 years ago.\n- I get it that the scale had to be smaller than ETS2 as U.S is really big, but as pointed out for many US players, they went too far on a 1:34 scale. A lot of stuff feels off and everything is rushed\n- Jesus Christ what is going on with the fine costs? Was forced to disable it\n- Was really not a good idea to launch a game with such a small scale with only 2 states.\n\nIn the end, the feeling that ATS should be at maximum an ETS2 Expansion is really strong.\n\nAnd despite it costing a lower price on US, they didn't customized the cost for other countries so it's costing close to full / AAA games in many stores.

When I could drive a car, I didn't enjoy it.\n\nSo why am I in love with this game?\n\nI bought this on a whim. Hey, it's $20. If I hated it, I could always get a refund. I played for about half an hour the first time, barely making it out of the tutorial. I had chosen the third "level" of controls (shifting and mouse steering) out of four, which made the game unintelligible to me. I considered, and discarded, the idea of getting a refund. It was a neat game, but definitely not for me since I never knew how to drive a standard anyway.\n\nThen I started it up again later that evening... and I've been playing for hours ever since.\n\nSomething about this game is so soothing, so freeing - it's unbelievable. The graphical fidelity reminds me of GTAV, although (obviously) less detailed and not bothering with animating humans. Neon blinks uselessly in open starry nights, proclaiming doughnuts here / left turn only / ACME goods. A year ago, I took a ride with a friend out into the wild empty desert around Barstow (and yes we did have Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas audiobook playing while we did so). This game does a wonderful job at capturing the grit and loneliness of that open, alien world.\n\nI finally figured out how to not roll backwards when I get to the top of an onramp. That was a good thing. I feel clever when I do things like this - I understand now why people drive, I think. Downshifting to slow down when I see brakelights flash briefly in the distance... and then, sure enough, there's a traffic light I didn't anticipate but I'm already slowed down!... these things make me feel that private sort of joy you get in any video game when you make a particularly difficult play.\n\nI don't know why I like this game. I'll never be great at it, and that's okay. I have no interest in trucking, or driving, in the real world. But I wanted to write this review to let people know that this game might grab them in the way it did me.\n\nGive this game a try.\n\n\n\nOne quick edit while I'm thinking about it: Most of the negative reviews here are due to two main factors:\n1. Actual, real, live, human truckers disappointed that the game does not perfectly capture the depth or distance of driving for 40+ hours at a stretch (I am okay with this; I have no desire to sit for that long). I understand, but I disagree with, that as a criticism. Games must remove some of the tedium from real life.\n2. People giving temporary thumbs-down because the existing world is rather small. True. There are only two states out of the forty-eight that comprise the continental US.

I remember many years ago, stumbling acorss americantrucksimulator.com to find that the domain was being held for future use, I had high hopes for the game when it was finally released, and SCS didn't disappoint.\n\nInitially, my biggest concern was that the environment and feel was going to be too much like what Europe thinks of North America rather than what it's really like over here, and while it's difficult to explain, those elements do exist, but fortunately not to the degree I had initially thought. Screenshots of the game in the past year kind of made me worry about this, but the initial release isn't so bad.\n\nMy favourite thing is that they've solved pretty much every issue I had in terms of driving physics - problems that were present in past games and even ETS2. With the transmission setting set to advanced, the game allows for clutchless shifting (with proper timing, naturally) with controllers like the G27, and the engine doesn't have the torque converter feel where applying throttle doesn't instantly raise the rpm by a couple hundred. If you're not sure what I mean, play ETS2 with a high horsepower truck like an FH with 750hp and while coasting, hit the gas and watch the tach.\n\nOne of the things I wasn't fond of in ETS2 is the fact that many cities and roads are so hard to differentiate. I could never find my way around if not for the GPS. The Scandinavia DLC is an exception to this IMO, but it seems like every city and highway is mostly the same. ATS on the other hand, has very original and unique areas, as well as cities of varying sizes. I hope that this, plus the fact that they'll be releasing the map in bits at a time, will mean that we can sort of learn our way around through experience, and certain areas and roads will become more familiar overtime. I'm really glad to see SCS try to make each area of the map unique, original, and realistic.\n\nA number of people have complained about the current lack of trucks, many saying that they should have done like they did with ETS2 and release them unlicensed first. I think that there is a lot of legal mumbo jumbo involved. It's hard to criticize SCS for this when you don't know what their legal obligations are, and where they are currently at with truck manufacturers.\n\nThere's still things I'd like to see improved, like the audio, but I can't even imagine how hard it is to make a realistic sounding truck without hearing audio loops and allowing it to fluently change as engine rpm increases and decreases, or even as more or less throttle is applied. With each truck so far, as engine rpm increases it seems to go through 'waves' for lack of a better word, where once you hit 12 or 1300 rpm, the tone resets down to sound lower again. Again, difficult to explain.\n\nKudos to SCS Software. They're definitely on the right track. My favourite thing about them as a developer is that they listen to their community very actively and are quick to make changes if needed. This game was released at a lower than expected price point and I am very, very eager to see where ATS goes in the future.\n\nI highly recommend this game to anyone looking for a relaxing but enjoyable simulator, not only for the game but for the amazing developer that stands behind it.","March 9","true","40.5"," 17 of 19 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","17","19","0","0"

I really hope they can some implement this in the next couple states, or at least fix the highways already.\n-The cop presence is high, it was a little annoying at the start because of how I could go 1mph over the limit and it would still go, just a little more sensitive than ETS2.\n-The AI is horribly wrong, honestly SCS, what's up with the right left turns on red and merging? Left-turns are okay, but can be improved upon.\n-The map is unrealistic, it's like this, get a job, go on interstate for literally 5 mintues, exit, drop off load, repeat. This whole process could take 10 minutes.\n-Truck customization is extremely limited.\n-As an AMD user with an MSI R9 290, I am getting some performance messes, even outside the cities. I've only noticed 2 of these, so it's minor, but noticeable.\n\nI will update this later on, but in the mean time, SCS, please polish your game and add more content.","February 3","false","14.9"," 122 of 206 people (59%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","59","122","206","8","4"

There are MAJOR issues with the CA map, that just can't be overlooked.  First off, the geography is bad. IE, they have Oxnard, where the city of San Luis Obispo should be. Second, they didn't put in the grapevine, or the Cajon pass to Barstow, Nor the baker grade (all of which are land mark places in the real world and known truck challenges.  Second the time compression is too much, it should take a while to get to Las Vegas from LA, not minutes in the real world.  The graphics are nice, but again, the bloom is too much and the Dashes on the trucks are overly fuzzy.\nits nice to drive in the US, but the map, and compression need to be re done.

I played so much of Euro Truck Sim 2, so an American version was really exciting. Everything that was in the European version is here, so if you've played ETS before, you'll have no problem skipping all of the tutorials and jumping straight into the game. They added a couple of new features, like choosing your parking difficulty and weigh stations and the lanscapes look exactly like their real life counterparts. They really did their homework in that regard. However, the game was still extremely disappointing. For one, there were only 2 playable states on launch: California and Nevada. This means completing the game is a lot easier and routes tend to be much shorter. I wouldn't mind too much, if it didn't mean traveling on the same highways over and over again because the longest routs usually take you to the same places. The game also only launched with only two trucks too, which is weird because I thought this was called American TRUCK Simulator. I know the lack of trucks was because of licensing issues and they'll be adding more trucks and states later (I believe they already added another truck in an update), but it was still disappointing to see this go a similar route of Sims 4 (a new installation in a franchise with less content than its predecessors). Don't get me wrong though, I still really enjoy what the game had going for it so far, and I've logged quite a few hours into the game already, however, I can't recommend buying it right now since there's not much in it yet. Wait until they add more content, then I really recommend buying it.","February 28","false","24.3"," 44 of 68 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","44","68","0","0"

After much thought I’ve decided to give the game a thumbs down, it saddens me to do so.  I play ETS2 all the time and absolutely love the game.  American Truck Simulator doesn’t even come close in comparison, it’s child’s play in comparison.  I live in Reno and I can say without any doubt that Reno is wrong in almost every way.  About the only thing you got right was some of the buildings, short of that, it’s completely wrong.  Most of Nevada is wrong if you want to know the truth.\n\nI-80 westbound out of Reno is like driving a road course.  Full of hairpins, twists and turns, did you guys even come to Reno?  I-80 eastbound out of Reno…don’t get me started!  Donner Pass is over 7,000 feet and in the game it’s nothing more than a slight incline and you’re done.  From Reno to Sacramento is over 2 hours, in the game it’s 2 minutes, what’s that about?  Reno to Vegas is over 8 hours, in the game it’s maybe 6 minutes, what’s that about?  It’s 4 hours from Reno to Elko, in the game it’s 4 minutes, what’s that about?  Have you guys seen the Sierra Nevada Mountains?  Have you guys seen Tahoe?  In the game the Sierra’s simply do not exists in any way, shape, form, or fashion.\n\nWhat’s up with the AI traffic, it’s relentless, and you have traffic jams everywhere.  If you’re not at a light you’re screwed trying to get out.  What’s up with the ramps onto and off the freeways, why are they so short, have you drove in the US, we don’t have short ramps.  Many of the exits and ramps look like what you find on ETS 2.  I really wonder if your team even came to the states and looked around, really I do.\n\nI’m not going to stop playing either game but after all the hype about ATS, I found it to be such a letdown.  ETS2 is an awesome game so it gave me hope for ATS, it is clear something went very wrong.  I have faith it will get better.","February 2","false","76.9"," 22 of 29 people (76%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","76","22","29","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/roadrunner1/recommended/270880/","roadrunner1","Road Runner","http://steamcommunity.com/id/roadrunner1/","551 products in account","ATS very much looks, feels and plays like ETS2. Whether that's a good or a bad thing is very subjective. It's perfectly understandable that some people call it a glorified DLC and that there isn't much content at the moment. But let's be honest, the game is also priced as a glorified DLC :)\nThe base game consists of the standard assets and the state of California. All other content is added in the form of DLC's This can be both free or payed DLC. Like in ETS2, new trucks will be added to the game for free. Currently, due to licensing issues, there are only the Peterbilt 579 and the Kenworth T680. SCS already has a few more trucks ready to roll out as soon as they have the approval. The first two new states are also added as free DLC. Nevada was released together with the base game and Arizona will be added soon, altough soon can easily take a few months in SCS terms ;)\nGraphics and performance have improved over ETS2 but not by a huge margin. I think ATS looks a bit better with improved textures, especially the roads. It's also more detailed and has way more variety in the scenery, while in the stock ETS2 map it was just more of the same. The engine also seems to be better optimized, wich results in a bit smoother fps. Only 64-bit is officially supported this time. SCS is offering an unsupported 32-bit version for a limited time, wich can be obtained via de Betas tab within the game's properties.\nThe game can perfectly be played and enjoyed with a controller. Settings like sensitivity and deadzone can be adjusted for the analog controls. Off course, a keyboard also works but... don't, just don't. For the full experience, a steering wheel is highly recommended, just as much as with a (semi) realistic racing game. It's a complete gamechanger. If you also own a TrackIR, great, another gamechanger! All SCS' trucksims have native support for this device.\nA neat new feature are multiple ways to park your trailer. Not in the mood for difficult parking but just pressing Enter is to fake? Just do it the easy but 'legal' way and just drive your rig forward in the designated spot. However, this will off course result in less XP than you would have gotten when parking like a boss.\nI do have some minor complaints. ATS still has the same simplistic road network that ETS2 has. Second, the scaling of the map; it's smaller than ETS2's scale. I can understand that they had to do this since the US is such a ridiculously large country. I just would have wanted it to be a bit larger. Travelling from city to city is over just to quickly. Than there's the AI -_- It has improved over ETS2 but it's far from perfect. There are still many AI drivers who never passed their driving test and somehow managed to get a car. Remember those creatures in ETS2 who stopped on the highway to let you merge? They're not only living in Europe. The game also doesn't have much variety in AI vehicles. Well, noting that the modding community can't fix. ATS has the same extensive modding support that made ETS2 a huge success. That also puts the lack off standard content a bit in perspective, unless you don't want to use any mods. At the time of writing, there are already lots of mods available, including drivable trucks, cargo's, AI vehicles, skins etc. Map expansion are just a matter of time.\nSCS took their sweet time to release this game and many expected a bit more content at release. I'm sure they will take care of this, like they did with ETS2. That game is well over three years old now and is still being worked on.\nIn the end SCS delivered the quality that we come to expect from them. If you played and like ETS2, you will feel right at home in ATS. Even with it's flaws and weaknesses, it's still that ultra relaxing driving experience that so many people love.","February 7","true","41.5"," 37 of 57 people (65%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","65","37","57","3","5"

It's great seeing the new game assets that are entirely different to those in ETS2 - new trucks obviously, but also a large range of new vehicles, new scenery props, new architecture, new road designs - and some fun things that enhance the ambience like helicopters, jets, shooting stars and flocking birds. There are some new mechanics too, including police cars that tag you with flashing lights and sirens when you get a fine for speeding/crossing red lights.\n\nThe company extensively researches truck sounds and handling to give you a more genuine experience when driving the trucks, and they spend an inordinate amount of time getting the locations looking like their real-world counterparts (within the limits of the game), which is all very nice (and you can see side-by-side comparisons with Google Street View shots) - but the main reason I enjoy it is that it's just so damned relaxing. If you're looking for a serious, hard core driving sim with realistc crash physics, go play something else - this isn't that game. This is a casual game about driving a big truck around, taking in the scenery, listening to some music, and gradually building your trucking empire.","February 6","true","79.4"," 51 of 83 people (61%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","61","51","83","6","0"

I was hoping this would be a new game, but let’s be honest, it’s just a reskinned ETS2. If you were to take an alpha state ETS2 full conversion mod of the US(California), add a few new features, take away all the trucks but 2, forget to rescale the game for the sheer size of the US, and add overly aggressive police, then you have American Truck Simulator.\nAll BS aside, it’s not ALL bad;\n\nPros\n+ Feels more like being in civilization\n+ More options to park trailers\n+ New places to deliver to aside from just industrial like ETS2\n\nCons\n- Horrible scaling (most of western Europe can fit in 1/3 of the US, yet takes only 5 mins to drive from Barstow to Sacramento vs that same mileage in ETS2 taking 30-45 mins)\n- Same 4-year-old ETS2 engine\n- Same ETS2 UI, Sounds, Physics, Graphics\n- Overly aggressive police which account for every 3rd vehicle, not to mention all the ones hiding on side of roadways.\n- No real changes or innovations over ETS2, despite game being 4 years newer.\n- Weak day 1 release content\n\n\nGranted I understand this is a brand new game, so content will be lacking vs a game that has been built and refined for 4 years, but come on, seriously? A few cities? 2 trucks? Same exact engine that ETS2 was on? Couldn’t even at least change the UI to somewhat make it feel like a new game? I cannot recommend this game in its current state. ATS is a perfect example on how “DLC” has ruined the industry, allowing developers to give you only 30% of a game, then make up for it later with “DLC” instead of just spending the time to make the full game first.\nSave your money and get ETS2 instead. ATS might be worth a revisit 1-2 years down the line after 5-6 more DLC are released to finish the game, plus tons of content patches (which I do give props to SCS on actually), but not right now. ETS2 offers far more game for your money. This is a joke.\n","February 8","false","5.1"," 80 of 136 people (59%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","59","80","136","7","11"

I think the game is being priced right. I am a huge ETS2 fan with over 300+ hrs logged so far. ATS on the other hand is a disappointment compare to ETS2. As many have said that the map is extremely small. Even with the upcoming extra Arizona state add on it still about just half the size of ETS2 based game. But the most dissappointing factor for me is not the map size, but how the dev scale it. In ETS2 an hour of in-game driving time would be equivalent to 4-5 minutes in real time, in ATS is about a minutes. Given the fact that the driver will need to take rest every 15 hrs of in-game time you'll be spending most of your time looking for motels and rest stops. If you enjoy the driving experience in ETS2 with long haul you will be met with frustration in ATS. Feel like the devs just quickly put together something and release it, doesn't feel like a completed or stand alone new game, even UI is completely the same as ETS2.

Problems such as Hwy 395 going to Redding, Hwy 299 from Redding to Eureka is extremely flat when its pretty mountainous, random road running parrallel to I-5 north of Sacramento, a random hill that should not be there just north of I-5/I-80 interchange near Sacramento, the I-5/I-80 interchange being in the woods when its in an urban area of Sacramento, Oxnard is too far north pretty much located where San Luis Obispo is, Oakland is not located off I-5 via a short drive on the 580.  It's like the map is way, way too condensed for a state as large as California.  Also small things like seeing a sign for I-80 North when even number interstates are always east and west and odd numbers are north and south as well as traffic signals and left turn lanes on interstates which are not found on interstate freeways.

There's way too many inconsistencies in this game California Scenic Simulator to recommend others to purchase it. As others have said-\n\n- Game strongly resembles ETS2\n- Graphics to me feel worse than ETS2 but could just be me\n- Gameplay feels sluggish\n- It's like an Apple product that got a re-skin\n- Trucks feel slow, sluggish, inconsistent to actual American trucks, speed limits are weird, speed is mostly capped at 55 and sometimes drops from 55 to 30 and then back to 70 and then within .01 seconds it drops back to 55 and if you're speeding during those times (like less than 5mph over) prepare yourself for tickets\n- Stop signs at street lights\n- Sometimes traffic at intersections is neverending and the only way to proceed is to save the game and reload so you have a chance of finishing a load\n- Anti-aliasing? I'm pretty sure the developer has no idea what this does and why it's important\n- Same music as ETS2\n\nSimply put: It doesn't feel like an American Truck Simulator game.

It doesn't really feel like another game SCS has made, it feels like more of a dlc for ETS2.\n\nWhy do I think it is like a dlc?\nReasons:\n-There are only 2 states, 1 more for free is being developed by SCS.\n-Only 2 trucks (Kenworth and Peterbilt).\n-It was a bit expensive for my region (well it's not really SCS's problem, it's my country's economic problem. I'll be paying the same in Dollars or Euros).\n-It feels imcomplete (I do not really know how to explain this but....... I had feelings like this while playing).\n-It's not polished (there were some bugs, but it doesn't occur that much.\n\nIf only Steam gives an option of "meh" or a middle type of option rather than positive or negative. If you're an SCS fan like me, go ahead buy it or not it's your money and your choice to do so. If you're not a fan of SCS, I'd say you better wait for the sale of this game or not I don't really care about your decision, all I can do is give you that option of buy it on sale or not.\n\nI bought it early because I can't control the hype I had.\n(sorry for bad grammar, I has bad english and a proud asian).","February 3","true","40.7"," 56 of 95 people (59%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","59","56","95","5","1"

The mechanics of the trucks is quite impressive. If only they would fix all the annoyances. 12 minutes. I mean, as a DLC to Euro truck simulator this would be ok, but as a separate game with a few years extra dev time I would expect a better experience.\n\nThe addition of police cars seemed like a good idea at first, but the zero tolerance for speeding combined with there sixth sense for detecting speeding makes for an unpleasant experience. I'd like to see the real world cop that would accurately detect a 5 mph speeding in the rear view mirror. 15 minutes.\n\nAnd who the hell is fining me for hitting a red light when there is no one around? Once I actually got fined for backing out of an intersection when the light turned red, and it turns red freakishly fast. And how difficult would it be to add some logic to the traffic lights so I don't have to stop at every single intersection in a town?\n\nLess intelligent then the traffic light are the AI-drivers. So I've waited for 17 minutes before pausing the game (or else I would get fined for delayed delivery). There is a great tendency for deadlocks, sometimes cars are literally standing in a circle waiting for each other. When trying to get out of deadlocks it's not uncommon for other cars to crash into you. They could avoid it, they just don't try to. Seeing a car decisively running into your side at a steady 10 mph is somewhat fascinating at first, but it quickly gets old, especially if you get fined for it. Sometimes you don't get fined for crashes caused by others, but you never get compensation for any damage.\n\nAnd for some reason (or lack of it), all time estimates in the game seems to assume an average speed of ~38 mph, no matter what. Why? And what sort of bank only allows 4 fixed loan amounts?\n\nAnd for some reason (or lack of it), all time estimates in the game seems to assume an average speed of ~38 mph, no matter what. Why?

I know some trucks and states (like Arizona) will be added for free, but most states will be paid for. I'd be okay with this, if the game was not already too small. It takes four real life hours to drive from Los Angeles to Las Vegas. Yes, I know the game is compressed because nobody wants to drive somewhere for four hours when they could do the same thing in real life, but it shouldn't take less than 20 minutes. If I can drive from Los Angeles to Las Vegas in 20 minutes, how long will it take to explore the entire game? The game claims it takes five in-game hours from LA to LV, but a five hour trip in Euro Truck Simulator 2 took an more than an hour in real-life. This game is obviously incomplete and released too early. The lack of content is to tempt you into buying more DLC once it comes out, which is just dispicable. The game is fun, but it's not worth $20 when for just a few more dollars, you can get more content with Euro Truck Simulator 2. I was hugely disappointed in American Truck Simulator.\n\nAlso, not only is the game's UI and menu identical to ETS2, the geography is wrong. San Francisco, Oakland, and Oxnard are in the wrong place.

Traffic-rules AI is over-zealous and will issue fines upwards of $700 ingame currency for the minorest of mistakes.\n\nThe map is tiny and the two states provided (Cali and Nevada) are so condensed that a trip from LA to Oxnard is in length comparable to Rotterdam-Amsterdam in ETS2. Time flies so fast that your fuel-tank is always empty and your trucker is always yawning.\n\nThe two brands of trucks the game starts with are legendary and speak to the imagination, Peterbild and Kenworth, the Adidas and Puma of the truckingworld. But they're weaksauce dinkytoys that can't even pull a load up a hill without losing steam and are hardly the monsters they ought to be.\n\nThe highway-system portrayed in the game, which is a simulator, does in no way reflect the actual highway system in use in America today and is in that aspect worse than the  German Autobahn portrayal in ETS2.\n\nThe handling of the trucks feel floaty or loose which gives the whole experience a very arcady feel.\n\nATS is however a beautiful game, much of which a follower of SCS has come to expect. But beautiful graphics do not make a simulator. Realism (as much as possible anyway) and depth of simulation is. ATS is an arcade trucking game, much like Big Motha Truckers, but without the fun.\n\nI would suggest that you buy Euro Truck Simulator 2. It has more depth of simulation, more destinations, less absurd time-compression, more trucks, more jobs, more different trailers and a more diverse landscape.\nIt's also cheaper, both in the meaning of the word and in what you get for your money.","February 15","false","27.2"," 92 of 165 people (56%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","56","92","165","14","0"

While it may be only a couple of states covered, there is a lot of potential of having the entire country mapped out, even if that means multiple DLC map expansions.\n\nIf you're a recent truck sim player, you may or may not be aware that the developers of Euro Truck Simulator 2 and ATS have developed the 18 Wheels of Steel series during the 2000s decade and it has been a while since the late time they focused on American trucking in 18 Wheels of Steel: American Long Haul.  Since then, the map scale has increased a great deal, focusing on more American cities than ever before.  While some have noticed that the scale is a bit more compressed in comparison to ETS2, it doesn't seem to bother me as I understand that there is already a daunting task from the small development team as it is.  The same goes for the number of trucks because of their focus on wanting only licensed trucks in the game.  You can count on the modding community to address these shortcomings quickly and new official trucks get added in for all players at no charge, as was the case in ETS2.\n\nIt is generally the same basic gameplay as ETS2 and there is nothing wrong with that.  A couple of new features have been added to set it apart: weigh stations and multiple parking spots.  The latter adds some of the more challenging parking trials to the player and tests your skills. Or you can skip those challenges if you want to keep things simple.\n\nIn spite of the smallish map, there is some nice attention to detail from the silly billboards in Vegas to the amusing amount of burger and donut places,  A few faults with how some of the intersections are laid out, particularly with the less than ideal traffic light situation for cars wanting to turn left. Having a left turn only light would be helpful.  Police presence are rather plentiful and some have complained about frequent tickets, but it really helps to pay attention in advance to when the speed limits change. Just expect some inconsistency with speed limits.\n\nFor the price, it's really worth it regardless of if you're an old veteran or a newbie wanting to know what trucking sims are all about.","February 13","true","29.2"," 18 of 27 people (67%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","67","18","27","3","1"

Unfortunately, it is only set in California and Nevada, which means you have a very limited map to work with.  I miss the ETS variety of cities and countries, and I don't think that the size of the US is an excuse.  More states should have been included, and having them as DLC later on is pretty lame.\n\nIn addition, police fines are brutal, so if you go a bit over the speed limit then you may be losing half of the income from that haul.\n\nUltimately, the game feels bland to me so far, but I will need to see more to decide more completely.  Hopefully I can get more into it, but I am not liking it the way I enjoyed ETS 2.

And for tha reason I wouldnt recommend it.\n\nIf you like truck sims, I can guess you have already purchased most of the DLC's from the previous game, and if its really American rigs you like, I would save your money and just use MOD's for Euro Trucks, theres a far greater choice of American rigs for free and the MODS are easy to install, plus many other maps etc to keep the game fresh.","February 14","false","4.9"," 28 of 48 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","28","48","0","3"

Thought I would give this a try... Well its basically Euro Truck just set with different scenery and so forth. Which I am ok with for the record. My biggest issue is that its so super un realistic and inconsistant. For One there are cops EVERYwhere. And the same cop can peg you multiple times at $1000 a pop. First off no traffic ticket in the US is $1000 unless its a DUI and so forth. Two there are stationary cops on the side or the road... They dont peg you. And lastly even if you are driving behind a police cruiser they hit you with a ticket also. At $1000 for a load that nets $2100 this is rediculous. These issues are NOT present in the Euro Truck game, at least from what I have seen and have played a good amount of time on that. This just seems like a rushed game profit vs the fans. I will continue to play this game because I am a fan of the franchise, but I would NOT recommend anyone to buy this as their first purchase in the franchise.

If you’re an American this may be different but the appeal to me is to drive around with my truck following the laws of the road and enjoying myself. I know that many people won’t enjoy this style of game, but then again I don’t enjoy Fifa (other football and sport games are available).\n\nThe game looks much better than European truck simulator the cities and even down to small details such as cracks in the road. At the end of a job the parking process is much better as you get to choose how you want to park selecting from what is effectively; hard, medium and don’t park. The increase in fuel stations is good as in euro truck you could only buy fuel in a city if you had a garage upgraded. The coast roads look absolutely incredible (but with faster trucks in euro truck would be more fun there).\n\nI know more trucks and roads are coming but I find myself thinking why don’t I just play euro truck instead? The current engines available are low on power and the GPS likes taking you down extremely small roads. Also The game makes the ‘highways’ have more bends in them than the motorways in Britain and Europe. The police surprise attack you every moment you are speeding and they are very sneaky arriving just after a 30 sign that I happen to miss seeing. When you finally crawl up to speed on a ‘highway’ you are forced to slow down as the road just arrives in a city or town that you have no idea about until you either get fined for speeding or crash into cars waiting for traffic lights!!!\n\nIn conclusion although American truck Simulator is a good simulator I still feel like Euro Truck Simulator 2 is a better game. On euro truck I have put in 110+ hours (had none steam version for a while) and I have experienced that game to about the full whereas American truck simulator I only have about 3 hours of which I know isn’t a lot but still it is difficult for me to recommend.\n\nSo in it's current state I cannot recommend this game, with more trucks and roads in future this may alter my view.\n\n*Disclaimer*\nI know more trucks and roads are coming and I know that you can get mods for removing the police and increasing engine sizes but I wanted to play this game properly but despite this I wasn’t levelling up very quickly and I wanted to see what truck options were available so I had to use an XP cheat mod so I could see the options.\n\nEdit:\nThe traffic light situation was improved but the game still isn't as good as ETS2","February 9","false","12.5"," 14 of 23 people (61%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","61","14","23","0","0"

Though I found a lot of things that are not close to being realistic, this game offers a variety of things I have seen that are. For one I found the graphics in this game better then what is in the real million dollar (plus) simulaitor I've had the privilage to use on more then one occasion and I like the way this game gives a very small taste of some of the realisticly hard places to get in and out of and a little of what real truckers may encounter during a trip. I'd also like to mention the fact that for what you get in this game I feel is very reasonably priced do to the fact that everything that is left out such as pre-trip inspection, log books, dealing wit dispatchers and brokers and even the creativity involved in finding a place to park in a truckstop after dark would all cost the developers more time and lead to a much higher initial cost to the gamming community. With all that being said, The biggest draw back to this game is that even though it can be played with a keyboard and mouse it is very difficult and somewhat tireing as both hands a kept busy all the time as you are constantly pressing keys to correct steering with one hand and with your other you are ajusting camera angles, operaitng turn indicators, and a ton of other tasks. Breaking is another difficult thing to master with a keyboard as if you leave your finger on the break button a millisecound to long, You will stop dead in the road or sidewalk, whichever you may be driving on at the time. One really needs a gaming steering wheel and pedel set up. This would defenitly improve a players gamming experiance and I think should be listed as a recommendation under the system requirments. I am currently using a mouse ,Keyboard and Logitech flight stick (to help with smoother steering but even that gets old fast and I am only commpleteing 3-4 trips a day before movig on to a more casual game. So in closing I just want to say if your thinking about purchesing this game, you may wish to consider the computer hardwear I mentiond first, that is if you can afford the expence, otherwise you may feel a tiny bit disapointed as I do.","February 22","false","46.6"," 16 of 27 people (59%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","59","16","27","2","7"

They would have to then go home with the notes they took and redisgn literally the entire map. Either SCS was too busy with the physics simulation to bother with the map, or (more likely) they just didn't take the time to do their research. Interstates do not have traffic lights on the intertate itself So why do you have several instances on this map where interstates are something other than interstates? And the speeds? This is not Europe.\n\nPlease put warning signs in this game. There are too many areas where you slow down the speed without any warning, and when I regularly have to venture through these intersections, it's not something I can do to relax once I'm used to it, it will always be a chore. Also please make it to where your AI actually cooperates with said speeds? Trying to deal with a busy freeway going 80 in a 55 zone isn't enjoyable nor realistic.\n\nIf you can deal with the bad map design (which will take a good bit of time to wrap your mind around), this game has a decent amount of simulation, but poor placement on all fronts (there are almost no rest spots decently placed, things you will absolutely need when doing long hauls, and the ones that exist are extremely poor in placement). The time restriction is ridiculous.\n\nIf you've played a another truck simulator before, give this one about six months and they'll likely have most of this sorted out. We also don't quite know what their plan is for DLC and for a $20 game this is rather threadbare. It's still quite a hot mess right now, don't buy.","February 12","false","14.8"," 30 of 55 people (55%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","55","30","55","2","0"

I did worry about the amount of content in the game compared to ETS2 at first. I have thousands of hours in ETS2 so ATS felt right at home. All the menus are the same, but slightly redesigned. The map might seem small, but it's still 1300km to cross the map which takes a good half hour.\n\nThere are only three trucks at the moment and customisation is limited, but I'm sure that more will be added and the Volvo has already been confirmed by SCS.","March 31","true","68.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Loads........... To make them drivable within ATS...a, "Converter Type Coupler"... that "Free-Stands" when disconnected is needed. A "Converter" also would require a, "Pintle Type Hookup", for the "A-or, Lead Trailer" along with a "Fifth Wheel Type Hookup", for the "B-or Following Trailer".\n\nTheres one more type of Combination too...without the Pintle Hookup! The "B" Train. This type relies on a Sliding Trailer Axle for the "A" or "Lead" Trailer. Whe the "Axle-Slider" is extended their is a Visible a "Fifth Wheel" on top of the "Trailer Axles". the "B" or "Following" Trailer attaches to this "Fifth Wheel" to make-up a "Set of B-Train Wagons" or "B-Train"\nReal Popular in Canada too, as its simple to "Hook and Unhook" and is Extremely more Stable than an "A-Train" or the almost obsolete/replaced "C-Train". The "B-Train" has over time replaced the "C-Train", as its less complex and requires less maintenance and training too.\nThanks\nNeilr","May 23","true","45.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Doesnt matter if you are in the middle of no where - didnt stop at a stop sign? ticket. Going 60 mph on a 55 zone, while in the middle of nowhere at night with no one to be seen? ticket. Going in the middle of no where in the desert and pass an imaginary red light? ticket. Going about your business and hit an imaginary car where no one is there? ticket.\n\nEvery npc civilian is blasting through a green light and you go right along with them , the same rules dont apply, if you go through a green light with everyone else, you get a ticket.

Same dumb driver faces, same lame truck sounds that make you want to put on euro skinny jeans and become a pillow biter, same dumb ai that crashes into you, rides up your a$$ when you're trying to turn around or need to pull that oversize gas tank into a gas station that is right of the road, so now you have to stop your parking attempt to clear ai cars that bunched up on both sides of the road, and be careful so you don't dink them cuz that's a $1000 fine. I set police to off right away after that. No more dumb fines.\n\nFew years after ETS2 and you're telling me they couldn't make multiplayer? Two trucks only? Oh is it cuz of licensing or they spent their time on hookers n blow? They had trucks w/no license in ETS2, they just changed their names. I wouldn't care if I was driving Macs or Panchobilt if the dealer had bunch of trucks to choose from.\n\nAnd every time I drive on the 5 up n down from LA I want to fly to whatever commie country devs are located n kick em in the balls since the real thing has like 12 lanes.. Not in game tho. Same lame 2 lanes with few stretches of short 3 lanes..ATS map is way scaled down because it's a ETS2 with a new map..\n\nIn the time of huge open world games this is what ATS brings to the table? roads that end with xxxxx marks you can't drive thru. So devs couldn't lay down roads every where in the game that you can just drive thru instead of being forced to this linear A to B path? Oh cuz the game is such a cpu hog? lol  With this old engine you could drive from mexico to Alaska and across the states.\n\nI stayed away from this reskin of ETS2 and only got the game thru twitch giveaway since I rather spend 20$ on a bottle of fireball I'm gonna ♥♥♥♥ away the next day.\nOnly reason I still play this now n then is the Peterbilt 351 mod. Great truck great sound.\nWhich brings me to mods. I'd happily pay 40$ to the mod team that made the multiplayer mod, not for this abortion of a game that's gonna have paid dlc's for upcoming states expansion.\n\nGet this game thru ATS twitch channels since I always see bunch of em having giveaways. Or if you're a fanboi. I don't ever underestimate fanaticism in people. Just read about someone getting stabbed waiting in line for a $1500 pair of ugly Kanye sneakers..","March 7","false","19.9"," 25 of 46 people (54%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","54","25","46","3","1"

I bought Euro Truck Simulator 2 on sale for $4.99 quite some time ago and have spent over 100 hours in it, as many have--it is one of those games I feel immensely guilty for buying on sale because of the quality of content and the massive enjoyment I get out of it. It is one of my top played games on Steam, and I currently own over 1,000 of them. It is also the only game I've ever bought DLC for (that wasn't part of the original package). In saying that, I own thousands of digital games (not just through Steam or even PC) and American Truck Simulator is the first digital game I've ever bought at full price (or at launch, for that matter).\n\nAmerican Truck Simulator is one of the few games that lives up to the "simulator" title. It is a top notch simulation game where you must work your way up from an employee that drives trucks for other companies to a trucking business owner with dozens or more of drivers that report directly to you and make you income. It is a game that will scratch your simulation/business management/love of driving/relaxation itch all at once. This is not a stressful game. Quite the opposite, in fact. This is one of those games that you can zone out while playing and relax your mind after a stressful day. Everything about it has been meant to be relaxing, and it succeeds tremendously (even missing a loan payment earns you a politely worded letter from the bank telling you they'll extend the extra credit toward you free for a few days until you can pay them back).\n\nThe game works with various controllers, from a 360 gamepad (which I use) to wheels and such if you're interested. It also looks beautiful on higher end PCs, though I prefer running it on my old non-gaming laptop for a small sacrifice in graphics quality, and it runs just fine. It launched at a $19.99 full price, which shocked me. I would have gladly paid $59.99 for this. I go by the $1.00 per hour of gameplay rule, and as you can see, I've already gotten more than my money's worth within the first week of launch. The game at launch includes two trucks (more to be added for free later on as they sort out licensing for those truck brands who doubted the game's viability) and two states, California and Nevada. In over 20 hours of gameplay, I have not discovered all cities yet and have covered about 50% of the map.\n\nThere are some concerns over the amount of content the game was launched with, or the idea that American Truck Simulator should have been launched as DLC for ETS2. I disagree with this idea. ETS2 was released in 2012 and is still being actively updated with DLC and free updates (including new trucks, paint jobs, etc.). I personally like having the two separate, and the fact that ATS was released for so cheap makes it almost comparable to the price of DLC to begin with. I have followed the game's development since it was announced a long while ago--I know the work SCS Software has put in to put loving detail into this game. I've read the updates where they've written how they've travelled out to record the audio of engines and carefully map the dimensions of the interiors and exteriors of various trucks, for one example. This is one developer that has built up trust with me, and this comes in a time of corruption from AAA publishers and the media that covers them alike.\n\nFinally, what are some of my complaints? I only have two, and one isn't really a complaint. For one thing, while the environments are already vast and varied compared to ETS2 (you now have deserts, farmland, oceanside, big cities like Los Angeles and Las Vegas, and even what I assume is a redwood forest), I do wish there was a way to have a taste of everything America has to offer in this. We have so many various landscapes here (mountains, forests, deserts, grasslands, swamps, beaches) that it's a little sad that we'll have to wait as the game is expanded over the years to reach them. My last complaint (and only real one) is that the speeding system in this is overbearing compared to ETS2. I see more cop cars in an hour of playing this game than I usually see in weeks of real life driving, and they can insta-ticket you for going 31 in a 30 speed zone, for example. It happens so frequently (particularly starting out when you're getting used to the roads and the system) that the resulting fees can cripple a newfound business owner. The only fix for this that I've found is driving at night versus the day-time, when traffic overall is lower and thus fewer cop cars are roaming about.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend that everyone try this game out (they released a demo today). It won't be everyone's cup of tea, but for people who like simulation games, driving games, or even just let-loose-and-relax games, American Truck Simulator can't really be beat. This was my most looked forward to game of 2016, and I'm not disappointed. I look forward to playing the game as it grows and expands for years to come.\n\nEdit 4/29/2016: I've noticed that an abnormal percentage of people have marked this review as unhelpful. As I always try my best to cover all aspects of a game in a review to be helpful to potential consumers, I would appreciate any comments on my review letting me know the information I've left out, or any questions you have about the game which my review left unanswered. I will update the review as applicable. Thank you!","February 10","true","27.5"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","60","9","15","3","2"

If you are looking for a way to just relax and take it easy, this is the game for you. The game can be hard, but only if you want it to be hard. You have almost complete control over the game which means you can make it easy if you are looking to just take it easy, or you can make it hard if youd like a bit of a challenge. With the easy to install mods as well as an already very nice game, you really can make this game whatever you would like it to be. If you are at all interested in this game, I highly suggest you go ahead and buy it. It is more than worth the price you pay with already free DLC that has either been released, or is in the works.\n\nIn conclusion, I definitely recommend this game if you think that this is something you would enjoy. It is well worth the price and can be edited to your liking. I hope this helps if you are on the fence on buying it, and I hope you have a wonderful time trucking!","February 28","true","399.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The core loop of pickup, drive, and deliver (with a dash of business management) is still there from ETS2. Cruising from the bustling cities in California, trough the barren night desert, and into a small town in Nevada is as satisfying as ever.\n\nThe map's scale may be smaller than ETS2, but ATS's world is much more dense and interesting. The use of vanilla ETS2's assets was very similar in every city. That is no longer the case with ATS. From the base level, there are straight up more things to see as you cruise from destination to destination. When assets ARE reused, they are done so in such a creative manner that you probably won't notice on first glance.\n\nMost notable of the new assets are the new locations where jobs are taken and delivered. Not only are they much more varied than ETS2, but there's an increased level of challenge when parking. Larger trucks and longer trailers combined with tight quarters and required blind-side backing make some of the drop-offs downright difficult. In fact, the difficulty as a whole has increased with ATS. The mobile police cars make avoiding speeding fines more complex than just cheesing speed cameras. Also, the rebalanced economy seems to have made it a little less easy to earn loads of money.\n\nHowever, there are still flaws. Unprotected, at-grade left turns onto freeways are a nightmare. The freeway traffic will never let up, so any AI in front of you will never be able to pull out. Even if you're lucky enough to be first in line at the turn, you'll end up slowly nudging your way into traffic to try and block them long enough to make it through. Then there are the small pockets of the road system where the speed limit rapidly changes from 70 to 30 to 55. God help you if a cop spots you going 31 in the midst of braking. Lastly, some truck customization parts are not present, such as air horns and extra lights.\n\n(UPDATE 2016/05/02 - SCS has since added protected left turns to some areas and made the speed limit changes more gradual. There are still a few rough spots, but way less than on release.)\n\nOverall, I am really pleased with ATS at the $20 price point, which is the same as the Scandinavian DLC for ETS2 when it came out. There may only be two trucks and two states, but SCS has been good about supporting ETS2 and they are showing no signs of changing. They've already confirmed at LEAST two more trucks, and the state of Arizona as free DLC. It will be interesting to see their plan for paid DLC to cover the rest of the country.","February 8","true","318.1"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","5","8","0","1"

However, I bought it after playing around with the demo and realising that it is all relative. Don't get me wrong, the map is small, and the longest drive I've done so far lasted no more than 40 minutes (I've spent a couple hours on a single job in ETS2). I have no doubt this will change over time, but I feel SCS has cheated the game by only releasing two initial states.\n\nPros:\n- Challenging driving with longer trailers\n- Selectable trailer drop off locations\n- Detailed scenery and roads\n\nCons:\n- The map is far too small in its current\n- Lack of trucks\n- Idiotic AI and overly harsh traffic penalty enforcement\n\nThis game is good for people who want a step up from the driving in ETS and ETS2, but I wouldn't strongly suggest people who own those games to get this as it feels more like a DLC or gimick having played the previous two games.\n\nFor those who've never played a truck sim, this offers a unique and in-depth entry into the game type.\n\nTL:DR\nGood game that challenges your driving skills, but map is too small.","March 11","true","33.4"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

And although it is based on ETS2 (which is very obvious from time to time e.g. the UI) it feels like a succesor, like progress and it feels like America should. The scale was changed, so that we have  more compressed map and time which does not break the feeling unless you played ETS2 right before playing ATS.\nIt features California and Nevada and someday we'll have the whole US in the game. The 3 featured trucks were made with the standards of ETS2 trucks. You'll feel how different they are (from each other and from the ETS2 trucks).\nThe map quality is at least as good as ETS2's Scandinavia map expansion and features a lot of little details making it feel more alive.\n\nAfter playing over a 100 hours I can recommend this to people that are interested in driving trucks through America the beautiful...","April 3","true","201.2"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

Why? The main thing that brought me to that conclusion was the scale in the game. A mile in game is equivalent to about 100 feet on the road,which makes a 100+ mile drive take about 10 minutes. Why does that drive of 100 miles (about 2 miles in real scale) take that long? Because the trucks are the most sluggish and poor handling things I've ever seen in a game like this. Having the petal matted to the floor and flat-foot shifting takes about 1 whole minute to get to 50mph. I can't recommend this game in this state.","February 5","false","0.5"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

It is very bare bones, with only Califonia and Nevada currently available. I find myself driving on the same roads over and over again, which gets very, boring very fast.\n\nThere are currently only 3 trucks in the game, 1 Peterbilt and 2 Kenworth, and therefore there are only 3 types of trucks the NPC's drive, which again is pretty boring to look at. There are also very few models of cars currently in the game.\n\nThe HUD and GUI are identical to Euro Truck Simulator 2, with only a couple of new icons added, which seems a bit lazy.\n\nAfter ~8 hours of playtime, I've discovered ~50% of the map, and I could probably have discovered 70% if I had just driven around instead of doing jobs. Additionally I've done 60% of the Steam achievements already.\n\nI can only recommend this if you are a Peterbilt or Kenworth enthusiast, but for everyone else, there really isn't that much to see or do in the game right now.","February 19","false","8.2"," 33 of 63 people (52%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","52","33","63","3","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Vorrrace/recommended/270880/","Vorrrace","<.GP}Cmdo.Delta","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Vorrrace/","168 products in account","I wanted to review this game and give it a good one because I like ETS2 and I wanted to support the devs. But, I thought it would not be right to do as (too) many people do and post a review (good or bad) without even taking time to try the game. So I played close to 5h and made at least 5 deliveries with and without owned truck before writing this.\n\n/!\ I will compare alot with ETS2 so if you are not familiar with this game, probably this review wont be the best so feel free to ask anything in comments below /!\\n\nLet's start with short review for those who don't want to read a novel and then I'll give more in depth of my thoughts for those who want to know more (keep in mind those "facts" are my own appreciation of the game and could differ for others):\n\nPROS\n- Graphics are as good as ETS2 (Scandinavia)\n- Map\n- Muuuuurica!\n- Maneuverability different from ETS2 ---> parking trailer is so much more fun and challenging\n- Weight stations\n- Cops\n- Higher amount of car models\n- Stop signs (not only red lights anymore)\n- Can turn right on red light as long as you do a stop before (as in real life eh eh)\n\nCONS\n- Graphics are as good as ETS2 (Scandinavia)\n- Map\n- Cops\n- Lower amount of truck models\n- No World of trucks deliveries.. not yet... it's probably coming ;)\n- no multiplayer --> i hope they'll consider it as the map will grow..\n\nGraphics are as good as ETS2 (Scandinavia) : It is good and bad at same time. Good because this mean you dont need an asskicking new gen high end PC to run this game, which is awesome for those who were running ETS2 on a lower spec computer and wanted badly to put their hands on ATS. For some people, it is a bad thing because they'll say devs didnt made too much work keeping the same game engine. I could agree with this and at same time I would say it's not fair to think they were lazy on this one. Scandinavia is a recent release (may 2015) and they worked hard to improve the engine. In Scandinavia (compared to basic ETS2), the roads are more sophisticated (less boring same looking linear roads), graphics are better, landscapes have way more details and stuff to look at while driving.. Well, overall, Scandinavia was really superior to the basic ETS2 in term of looking and, at least for me, I had a better time driving this part of the Europe. ATS is as detailed and good looking than Scandinavia. In fact, I believe it's even more detailed than Scandinavia. So I dont feel like devs were lazy taking the same engine. In fact, I think they work hard to improve it countinuously. Every update of the engine brings better graphics and more detailed environment. It's just awesome considering that most part of time, you drive straight forward and that your main entertainment is all about admiring landscapes.\n\nMap: It is not big right now. Only 2 states. A third is coming for free really soon. And for the rest? who knows. A bad thing for some people because they think the map is too small for the price of the game (and they are afraid SCS asks lot money to unlock the future states and countries)... and at same time, it's a good thing because the scale will be more interesting than ETS2 if they manage to make the whole US + Canada (maybe more if people keep supporting them). It's a huge project. It's a choice to do: will you support them and give money sometime or not? No matter what your choice is, I believe people giving a bad review to this game for the reason it'll cost money in the future, it is just stupid. The base game is pretty cheap. And this project is a big one. People working at SCS need to pay bills, to eat, to pay rent too... you can't expect to get all for free and for a cheap price on top of that. You can decide it's too expensive for you and ok, just don't buy it. But if you buy this game just to complain that it will be probably too much money for you to afford the new DLCs in the future, then you lost me on this one. Think about it before buying because tons of review warns players about this fact. It's nothing new and if you dont like their business model, just don't buy the game. That's it!\n\nMuuuuurica! : A matter of taste.. I prefer american trucks.. and north american landscapes too.. maybe be cause I live here... it feels more like home to me.. maybe.. ;)\n\nCops : It's good to have cops on the road... it gives a reason behind those tickets you were getting randomly. This is the good part of the story, it's more realisitc. Bad part now? The fine is abusively high and you get fined every time you do a mistake. Like I got a fine because I did a "stop" but the game didnt registered it or something so I got a fine. I got a fine for high speed because I was driving downhill at 25mph instead of 15mph (it's hard to break with a full loaded truck in San Fransisco hills lol) and I got fined by an invisible cop... it sucks.. seriously.. it's good to have it but crap.. 1000$ for every mistake and being fined every time you are not perfectly fiting in the square... they could be a bit more nice on this one. Some people said you can turn off fine. I don't agree. I'll try harder to watch speed and do stop as close as what I think the game expect from me... and hope I'll lose less cash in future. LOL\n\nHigher amount of car models: They really improved that. You'll see more different cars on the road, small trucks like UPS, Fedex, school bus... no really, way more enjoyable to drive with this higher variety of cars on the roads!\n\nLower amount of truck models: Only 2 models for now... but... they are awaiting authorizations to unlock all models that are ready. They said we would not pay for this, we just need to wait. So for those who are not patient enough and think 2 truck models is not enough, don't purchase now. Just wait a bit longer they got all legal stuff ok so they can add more models (cuz they have already tons of models ready).\n\nConclusion\nOverall, it's another upgrade of the SCS trucking simulator engine. Is it worth the price? Well if you are a fan of that kind of games, I think it worths it. I paid my 28$CA on release day and I dont regret it. I love ATS way more than ETS2. Sure, devs will have to work to improve and fix many things, but I have trust in them. I know I will get enough stuff for my money. And I know that in the future, they could release map expansions as paid DLC. It is something to consider when you buy it. You know it'll work like this so if you buy, keep it in mind and don't complain they are greedy dlcs ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. They aren't. This is a big project, you have the choice to be an "investor" or not. Personnally, I chose to be one because I like this game, I like the work they do and I want to give them the tools to lead this project to another success.\nIf you decide to join SCS in this epic journey, then I wish you countless hours of happy trucking.","February 2","true","37.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I played the heck out of ETS2 and was looking forward to this for a very long time. I actually took a day off work on the release date.\n\nYes, this is the same game as ETS2. But it is a different world to explore and build a company in and very well done from what i have seen so far. I have explored probably about 30% of the map i'd guess, and continue to smile checking out this new world! There is tons to see. The cities are bigger and more interesting. there are more small details like tumbleweed and events in the sky (no spoilers). The built in radio stations are fantastic and only add to the immersion and adventure. I suspect many of those complaining about size of the map went straight for the "Level 100 unlimited cash" mod, because playing the game as intended i'm having a blast and still have tons on my "to-do" list. Even then, the replay factor is huge, especially with mods.\n\nThere are, in-fact,  improvements over ETS2 as well. The new parking system is a nice addition. Optimization is better - I can run triples on higher settings with much less slow down. Quick saves no longer pause the action briefly. Police now roam the streets. I see more animations about the world.\n\nIt would be nice to see a shiny new graphics engine for this game, but given the end goal of SCS to create a massive online virtual world representing real geography the likes of which gamers have never seen at this level of detail, I support the decision to continue to use this engine. If you have the PC to run shiny new games, chances are you can run this on high settings where it looks great anyway. Triples + TrackIR + cup of coffee = casual driving heaven.\n\nAt $20, it's also a great value i'd say. I highly recommend this if you enjoy open world driving. Also, with a manual clutch FFB wheel and trackIR the game really gets immersive.","February 3","true","97.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/elektrifly/recommended/270880/","elektrifly","Flying Toasters","http://steamcommunity.com/id/elektrifly/","82 products in account","The counterpart to Euro Truck Simulator 2, American Truck Simulator takes SCS Software's classic European driving experience and brings it to the United States. American Truck Simulator is built off of the same game engine as Euro Truck Simulator 2, and it shares the same principle of its predecessor, where you start as a driver for hire before starting your own trucking company. Because of this shared engine, the game also supports the same control methods as its counterpart, such as racing wheels, gamepad controllers, and even the keyboard; the complexity of the controls can can be adjusted for an easier or more challenging driving experience. Like Euro Truck Simulator 2, American Truck Simulator is also under constant development. Although the base game was only released with two trucks and the states of California and Nevada, a new truck has since been added to the game for free, and the state of Arizona and another new truck will also be released as free DLC soon. However, what really sets American Truck Simulator apart from its European counterpart, and makes up for the initial lack of map and truck-related content, is the variety of unique elements added to the game. Larger and more detailed cities, randomly appearing police cars giving speeding tickets, random weigh station inspections, and the ability to make right turns at red lights make for a more interesting and enjoyable trucking experience. And even though the game is relatively new, there is a large and growing modding community; even though I personally don't use mods, there are many available which add features such as new truck models and even multiplayer support. Even though I think that the game is already pretty good as it is, if you are willing to be patient and wait for the aditional content, you will not be disappointed.","February 28","true","41.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

ATS provides a uniqe view into the world of a truck driver from just getting your CDL and driving loaner or company trucks to buying your first truck and becoming an Owner/ Operator. This game doesnt exactly scream excitement and if your coming from a FPS you may be initialy disapointed, but the steady hum of the diesel engine and the whine of the tires on the highway will suck you in, and if that doesnt do it for ya, take a cruise up high way 1 and take a look at the STUNNING scenery they've put into this game. The only addition I would like to see to this game would be to add buyable trailers so you can haul loads with your own truck and trailer and make more mola!!  18 WOS had this and Id really like to see it in this evolution.\n\nAll that said if your into driving sims, or want to try it out and see if its in your interest I absolutly recommend this game as it is a fine example of quality content and involved developers.\n\nI strongly recomend using a decent quality racing wheel or at a minimum a game pad (I currently use an xbox one controller) to get the most out of this game.","February 29","true","150.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I was not really happy with the short trailers and not much variety in truck I was hopping for t800 and maybe even a K123. I was hoping by now someone would have figured out how to make double trailers work on trucking games as 18 wheels of steel long haul did a good attempt but missed the fifth wheel pivot on the second trailer.

This game is early in it's evolutionary journey. I see much potential in this. There are features missing or not setup it seems, but nothing big.\n\n- The game seems lacking, in tucks and map, however they're working on it. The licenses are all that is left for the trucks and the maps are part of the ongoing evolution of the game, ETS2 style.\n- The game is essentially an ETS2 total conversion.  Is that bad? No. Why fix what isn't broken?\n- Traffic appears to have some improvement. It still has the blind driver that stupidly runs into you once in a while.\n\nThe game has a western US feel to it, driving through California or Nevada. It feels more immersive than ETS2, I find. I'm not far into it, but I enjoy a relaxing drive while listening to the radio.\n\nSuggestions?\n\nMy brother was suggesting tandem trucks, box trucks, maybe even expand into tow trucks and big rig tow trucks. I won't mention map expansion as I understand that is the long term plan.\n\nThough I feel like I'm asking way too much for this next idea, but I would love to be able to get out of my truck, walk around, inspect & secure the load, Bring the feet down to disconnect the trailer, hook up any applicable cables/hoses... etc.\n\nI remember the game, Rig'n Roll. It was more story oriented, but I enjoyed it. I liked the story feel to that game. It added a little personality.\n\nA suggestion for SCS, which could generate some extra income:\nImplement real advertisements on billboards around town and highways. Lots of potential for some passive income. It could help keep DLC costs down. Or free.\n\nI think ATS has a very bright future.","March 8","true","25.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I play this game just to relax and take my mind off of stuff.\n\nIf you enjoy simulators then this game is a great game to add to your list. It is pretty realistic and very detailed graphics wise. It has mod support (one of which is a multiplayer mod that I'll decribe as well). Regarding mods: Say you don't like the slim choices of trucks (which keep in mind they are adding more trucks and even more states soon), but you can just download a different truck design or even a car if you don't want to drive a truck.\n\nIn regards to the Mp mod: I will say that it doesnt have ai which is good and bad because no ai driving around means less lag with other players and not having to deal with stupid ai (which you still have to deal with some stupid player not understanding the physics or how its a simulator or whatever the reason is). What's bad about not having ai is that in this game the only way of getting fined for speeding is by cops (there are very little speed cameras), so people just decide to break all the laws because they can't get punished (or they don't care). And it's not like admin aren't there moderating it because they are.\n\nAll in all I would say to get this game but if simulators aren't your thing then just go play your shooters or whatever you find joy out of because this game needs more serious people especially in Mp. 9/10","March 15","true","149.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I actually waited a week or so after release, then decided to go ahead and buy it. I have zero regrets. This game is absolutely enjoyable, as it is an entirely different experience driving in ATS than it is ETS2. I still play ETS2, and will always have a fond love for that game.\n\nThe graphics are gorgeous, the trucks are even more so, and if you're new to ETS/ETS2/ATS, then I highly recommend you buy this (even ETS2, while you're at it). I have few gripes about the game, including the map scaling which really doesn't bother me all that much; the on-ramps on freeways are extremely short and not at all realistic, but again it doesn't detract from the game as a whole. Perhaps my biggest gripe would be the lack of states out of the gate. I understand there is a lot behind this game already, however, Arizona is the last free DLC that will be added to the game, which is still a few months away from release. It would have been nice if SCS would have done the entire Western United States as free DLC, maybe Arizona, Utah, Colorado, New Mexico, Wyoming, Idaho, Washington, and Oregon. Then had gone from there, just so there is quite a lot of distance to cover while they work on cranking out the paid DLC.\n\nRegardless, I love this game. While I have low hours played on it, don't let that deter you any. I play a variety of other games and love to give them equal attention. If you're able to, I suggest getting a steering wheel with pedals to add to that realistic touch. I play on a gaming laptop, so I have to use the keyboard which if you don't have the option of getting a steering wheel, still get this. Keyboard is still fun and the only thing you may have trouble with is backing the trailer up into position.\n\nI know this review is a bit scatter brained, and I apologize if it is a hard read. I hope with the paid DLC that they do it in regions, such as Mid-West, Eastern, etc., and not state-by-state. The game itself is $20, so I am hoping that the paid DLC stays under that price range. Get this game. You'll enjoy it, and have a blast.","March 5","true","10.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I'm driving my truck down a lonely road, through the empty desert. In the rear view mirror, I see a car approaching. I keep driving, expecting them to pass me, but they don't. I check back in my mirror, and- it's a police car. Okay, this is no situation to panic. I kept driving, slowly and steadily. But I felt myself growing tired. The road stretched on, seemingly endlessly. I finally could take no more and dozed off for anly a few seconds. When I woke up, I was going slightly above the speed limit, and I slammed my brakes. But it was too late. The police car had already called reinforcements. A line of six or seven cop cars was following me down the highway, sirens blaring. I suddenly get a storm of notifications from my GPS- my bank account is being drained, ticket by ticket. Then the shooting started, and they drove the truck off the road.

I look forward to seeing what other DLC will be released and the future mods for this game. It's a definite A++ in my book. And with a price tag of $19.99 it just keeps getting better and better.

It gives you a challenge but of course it is still fun at the same time. Very realistic, lots of details and even more than ETS2 I would say. The choice of trucks to start off isn't too bad, but of course it could be better but that will all be done when SCS get the required licenses to include more brands. The two starting states - California and Nevada were a great choice to start off with, as I'm quite familiar with the state of California and know my way around a fair bit.

OH, the amount of time it takes to find more cons\n- I've been sitting here for 7 minutes thinking of any. Ok... i'll move on.\n\n"Mehs" (Opinions, Most of these can be solved with mods):\n- Honestly, there is a lot of customization features but i feel like it needs more\n- Little more traffic variaty\n- The time it takes to get moving at the start (Just get a money/xp cheat on the workshop)\n- Size of the cities, they are kind of big, but i felt like they should have been made bigger\n\nThings they should add to the game (Most of this would be DLCs):\n- More intierior customization, same as wheel tuning DLC, but with the inside of the trucks\n\nI had more but they were stupid.\n\nAll in All, if you like driving simulators get this, if you don't, why are you here?\n\nPersonal Rating:\n\n9.6/10\n\n\n\nHave a good day\n-VV","May 27","true","15.2"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Well thats the point of this game, Its a driving sim at its finest. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a semi (get it? lol) relaxing driving game. I said semi though because if you do not follow the traffic laws (which can be turned off) and avoid the other drivers (that are seemingly soccer moms) the game can be a real challenge. The scenery going down the road is nice as well. Would love to see a few more in depth things added such as current market trends (Right now it seems you haul the same thing over and over if you just want to make the big bucks). Also, other than being able to customize your truck its actually better to just drive for a company. Much easier to make the cash. Adding in Multiplayer (which is currently only available in MOD form) would have made this game even better. So what are you waiting for? Get out on that Road now!\n\n7 out of 10 Overall a solid game but could be fleshed out a bit more as well as some multiplayer support, Also future maps will be DLC so the game has potential to become a moneygrab.","March 29","true","74.4"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

Than I would turn on the engine and drive my truck through valleys and fields and towns and unknown places. Cars will pass me. Some will vanish in the rearview as the cities fade out when I leave them. And I drive and I am free.\n\nBut than I wake up. I see the clock and know the alarm clock will go off soon. And I realize that I am caged and that I am just sitting in front of a screen showing me a life that I don't have but that I always desired. And my 9 to 5 job calls me and I work papers I don't understand and I don't connect. And I am a servant to my income. To pay for my home. But when I am back home, I will turn the engine on again and ride freely through a place that only exists in my dream.\n\nI am the freerider. And I am already home.

However its improves on most all of it. Scenery is more detailed in cities. Outside of cities its about as detailed as it can be for mostly desert areas. It does feel quite a bit smaller than ETS2 mainly because its 2 states at the moment. Which is disappointing but from what I hear Nevada is in the works and will be free so cannot complain to much about that.\n\nThe modding scene is in the works as well so I have no doubt in a few months we will have some amazing mods to go along with it. There are already some great mods for the game. I am excited for the maps mods.\n\nWhat impressed me the most was the sounds. I love ETS2 but when you get in one of these Peterbuilt or Kenworth trucks and get your truck moving it gives you chills.\n\nI have got 2 other drivers working for me and am well into making my trucking empire. For me this was a no brainer. I loved ETS2 however I prefer the North American setting so I grabbed this.\n\nI know this review is kind of all over the place. Moral of the story. If you have and enjoy ETS2 and are looking for something different this is not the game for you there is not enough to recommend switching. However if you prefer the setting by all means grab this game you will not be disappointed.\n\nIf you have never owned one of the trucking sim games but are interested.

Having never played a simulator ever before (as I usually stick with games that are not so realistic) I decided to try this one, because I'm always up for new things. First thing I am going to say is that if you're a graphic ♥♥♥♥♥ who only wants the best graphics, this is not the game for you. Also the traffic AI and citations are not the best either. However, if you can look past those flaws, the game is really great. Having experienced a little bit of the real thing, I can say it is fairly accurate to what being a truck driver is actually like. It's especially impressive considering that this is an indie game. My only real big complaint is the size. I would have actually liked all of America to be in it, instead of just Nevada and California. Also changing seasons and in game events based on in game dates would be a great way to expand the game. As it is, it's still worth the time and money and I think this was a great introductory into the simulation genre for me and for anyone else looking to get into simulation games.","March 15","true","28.4"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","1"

Those complaining about lack of map: They stated that the states will be released as future DLC. Seeing as how California alone is twice the size of the U.K I can see how it would take a bit of time to develop. As for the lack of trucks they ran into licensing issues with the truck companies BUT they did say after a few weeks they should have the go ahead to put more trucks into the game, which will be free updates. The only issue I really have with the game is the ridiculous amount of police around so just starting out you loose money quick from speeding tickets. Also to those complaining about the 55 mph limit on some highways: In California the law is trucks with trailers statewide cannot go over 55 mph. When you get into Nevada and eventually elsewhere the speed limit goes up to a decent speed.

I think everybody agrees that American trucks overall are better than euro trash trucks. Like come on, the flat nose garbage is a stupid design and bothered me the entire time I played euro truck sim. Second, I agree the map is way to small for what the game should have been. The amount of time they had to work on the game they for sure must've had time to increase map development. I'm not trying to pick sides with the haters but I have to agree that SCS is going to release a lot of map DLC because they know people will buy it which I think is pretty a S*H*I*tty thing to do as a company. But overall the game is a blast to play and I would highly recommend this over Euro Trash Simulator. 10/10 for trucks, 6/10 for the map size, 7.5/10 for the detail on the map its self.","May 6","true","649.8"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","54","7","13","0","0"

SCS outdid themselves so far.\n\nEDIT: I posted the review above with around 1 hour of gameplay.  After 24 hours, here is what I have come up with:\n\nPros:\n-Inexpensive\n-Very well modeled trucks, including the AI traffic.\n-SCS nailed North American scenery.\n-Realistic Traffic Lights\n-Hotels, Gas Stations, and Miscellaneous Buildings are awesome, I just want to keep looking around to admire the level of detail.\n-Same menu layout and settings as ETS2, that makes everything so much simpler.\n-Ocean Spray/Dust Storms\n-Highways/Freeways are fairly straight.  That is one thing I hated about ETS2, you felt like a NASCAR driver pulling 1G lateral acceleration around a highway corner at 62MPH/100KPH.\n-Realistic Sounds\n-AI traffic acts just like the idiots I see every day on the way to work.\n-Weigh Stations, that makes the game right there.\n-Realistic Gas prices\n-Options to park your delivery.\n-Insurance for repairs on your truck.\n-Transmission options. Now you can miss gears and it will keep grinding too! Amazing.\n-Tolls, even with the "I-Pass", that is just too cool.\n\nCons (I know, it was just released....but hopefully they fix these things)\n-FPS fluctuation.  I play on Ultra settings and get 60 FPS on the highway, but as soon as I get in the city, it drops to an average of 35 FPS.\n-Exit/Entrance ramps are not realistic.  Needs to be longer.\n-Too many Cops.","February 3","true","31.0"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","8","15","0","0"

It's the same engine, concept, layout, and core mechanics so you'll feel right at home. Despite the game not being listed as Early Access, you might as well consider it as being so. The amount of content is a little on the light side as of now, but more content (both free and paid) is definitely on the way. The content that is in the game is much higher quality than that in ETS2. The world is very detailed and feels rather lived in.\n\nCompared to ETS2, the difficulty and amount of grinding has been bumped up a tad. Speeding fines have since been toned down and the Police are a bit less insane in the recent update thanks to SCS. I definitely find this game requires a lot more of my attention while playing. I personally play with a Logitech G27 and a TrackIR; I wouldn't recommend trying to play with a keyboard and mouse, but if you're determined, feel free to give it a go.\n\nThe game now has three trucks, with a fourth potentially coming soon, and two states with a third in development. Modders have already rolled out a decent amount of content already, including a multiplayer mod. I find the combination of official and unofficial content to definitely be worth the $20, but that's just me.","February 4","true","73.3"," 9 of 17 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","9","17","0","0"

Pistolet, karabin i granaty otrzymasz w DLC. Kiedyś. A do tego czasu musisz sobie z radzić. Poważnie? Dwa ciągniki? OK, rozumiem, licencje, i inne takie. Ale bez przesady, Peterbilt oferuje 3 modele ciągników, Kenworth - 4. A my co dostaliśmy? Jeden Peterbilt i Kenworth i kolejne modele Kena i Peterbilta w DLC. Kiedyś. To jakaś kpina. A gdzie Mack, Volvo, Freightliner, Western Star, etc, etc? To jakiś żart? Sprawdziłem, dziś jest 3 lutego, a nie 1 kwietnia. I to nie jest śmieszne. Oczywiście, gra posiada sporo zalet, klimat np jest świetny. Tyle że w tej chwili to nie ma żadnego znaczenia. CoD bez broni też pewnie miałby swoje zalety, tylko co z tego? Ktoś z Was chciałby grać w CoD-a z nożem? Nie sądzę, choćby nie wiem ile zalet by miał. Smutna prawda jest taka, że SCS kroi 20 euro za niedokończoną grę. Jak dla mnie to najzwyklejsze złodziejstwo i rozbój w biały dzień. Wstyd! Jeśli chcesz kupić ATS to jak najbardziej zrób to, ale nie teraz.

Of course, the game also has lot of advantages, but at this moment it doesn't matter. CoD without weapons also probably would have advantages, but so what? It's would unplayable, like ATS in this moment. The sad truth is that the SCS takes 20EUR for unfinished game, and it's daylight robbery! Shame! If you want to buy ATS - do it, but not now.

City's, Hazard signs, and so on.   I mean in the EU you can understand it once you get a handle on things with your own handbook.  But with stuff that we Americans can read, who's never stepped foot outside of their own state.  It's a good feeling to not be confused.\n\n\nPro's and Cons to this game.\n\nPros\n\nEasy to get into for us Americans who knows not the rules of the road in Europe.\n\nGreat Graphics Highly customizable.\n\nHas a radio setup where you can listen to web radios while you're driving, though it kinda makes me feel like i'm playing\n"GTA" on safemode ya know? No crime lol.\n\nLicensed vehicals mostly.  Other than npc vehicals i'm sure they are gathering all proper licenses for each and every individual Trucks available on the US Market.\n\nDecent sound quality, Nothing noticable in this than it was in E.T.2.\n\n19.99 well, can't really beat that on 1.00 release day.  Especailly when you get two trucks and free skins with it and free Navada map.\n\n\nCons\n\nWell, I have to say, my biggest gripe is MAP SIZE!  I mean come on, they should atleast make it for every 5 hours it takes 30 minutes rl time to drive it.  But KRIPES! I was able to finish a 5 hour drive in less than 10 minutes following speed limet, They aut to extend the map size a litlte further.  or something. I'll probrably find a mod that does that anyway.\n\nI dont' know what else to put down.  It's pretty much the same as in E.T.2. with a twist, That's about it.\n\nMy rating for this game is this a solid 7/10 total, B+ for effort, B- for map sizeing.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/wyattzx/recommended/270880/","wyattzx","Wyatt","http://steamcommunity.com/id/wyattzx/","174 products in account","You are a truck driver. Your goal is to build your trucking empire, one job at a time. Beginning the game, you'll be introduced to a simple delivery job that explains the controls and acts as a tutorial. Afterwards, you'll be dumped at your garage, tasking with saving up enough money to buy your own truck by doing work for other companies. Eventually, you'll be able to buy your own truck, and gain access to the Freight Market, which pays more than the Quick Jobs from contractors. However, you'll have to pay for your own expenses: damages, fuel, fines, and more.\n\nThe graphical design of American Truck Simulator echoes the games of its past. While it does attempt to stay current with visual effects like lens flares, godrays and more, ultimately the game's graphics won't impress anybody. The truck models are highly-detailed, and leave little to be desired, but the textures throughout the world are often muddy, low resolution, and can be a bit of an eyesore up close. However, once you're out on the open highway, it's easy to find yourself getting lost in the long winding road ahead of you, with only subtle mountains in the background as a backdrop. The sun beats down on the hot tar below your tires, and it shines up in your face, effectively blinding you if you look just the wrong way.\n\nThese graphics, however, are a double-edged sword. While the game does by no means look great, this also allows for lower-end hardware to play the game, and play it well to boot. The game is not very demanding, and even lower-end configurations will not struggle to drive the game. On an NVIDIA GTX 970, paired with an Intel i7-5820k, I averaged 110fps throughout my gameplay. This is with everything maxed, and 400% scaling.\n\nThe trucks look good, the backdrops hold up well, but the ground textures, building textures, and AI vehicles look lackluster for a game released in 2016. When put alongside another brand new release, like Rise of the Tomb Raider, you can clearly see that SCS Software was not out to achieve the best in graphical capabilities.\n\nAmerican Truck Simulator is, at its heart, a simulation game. As such, it does this very, very well. Bar-none, it is the most realistic driving game available on PC, and likely available, period. That being said, the engine used in this game is the exact same engine in SCS Software's previous installment, Euro Truck Simulator 2.This means that while the simulation in this game is excellent, it's no better than the game before it. Granted, there's little room for improvement in the game, so I see no reason to fix what isn't broken here.\n\nImmediately starting the game, you'll find yourself dropped into a truck. On-screen prompts will walk you through the basics of the interface, and then you'll be on your way. This game has excellent gamepad and wheel support, and they should be a breeze to set up if you prefer it over kb+m. Once you're all set up, it's time to hit the road. You'll immediately notice how much weight you feel in your truck. The steering is heavy, the acceleration is a game of patience, and the laws of the road are ever-present, adding another layer of pressure while you're getting accustomed to your new big rig.\n\nJobs will require you to take a trailer of contents from one location to the next, and your SatNav will indicate your route. This will be your guardian angel as you trek across the land. Below your SatNav, your miles-to-go is displayed, letting you know how much longer you have left in your drive. You'll need to be particularly mindful of your fuel, and your consciousness. As you drive, these two will drain. If you become too tired, you'll drift in and out of consciousness, and eventually pass out at the wheel, racking up fines as you drive while exhausted. If you run out of fuel, you'll find yourself dead in the water in the middle of the road, with your only option being to pay for a tow truck to the nearest rest stop. The world of American Truck Simulator boasts a plethora of winding roads, hills and dusty back roads to drive across. Each offers a distinct style of gameplay while you head towards your destination.\n\nAmerican Truck Simulator™  is a fun game, hindered by a lack of content. While SCS Software plans to release additional trucks and states, in its current state, the game offers little more than a re-skin of its predecessor set in a not-so-interesting location. Fans of the previous game will definitely find many hours of enjoyment, but newcomers are definitely encouraged to look toward the previous title for their first foray into the truck simulation world. Small UI and gameplay improvements are a welcome addition, but it doesn't change enough to make it feel like a new game. With that said, however, it is priced competitively and fairly, and finds itself costing little more than the Scandinavia DLC for the previous game in the series.","February 5","true","17.5"," 10 of 20 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","10","20","2","0"

It handles reminiscent of Euro Truck Simulator 2 just a change of scenery and vehicles. For being released a little less than a week the modding community has been busy and has released many high quality trucks and mods to improve upon an already great experience.\n\nPros\n-The sounds are much more full than they are in the games European counterpart, these trucks actually sound like trucks.\n-The scenery is breath taking and nostalgic, capturing the atmosphere of the west coast pretty well.\n-The mod community has been busy and released many great mods.\n-The ability to control just how much simulation you want at any given time.\n-Great price.\n-Everchanging map due to the upcoming release of Arizona and other states DLC\n-The music that you can find in the radiostations enhances the experience.\n-Weight stations where you can be called to have a truck inspection.\n\nCons\n-Traffic AI can definitely use some polishing.\n-The railroad crossings are taken straight from ETS2 and repainted.\n-Police AI need some polishing (these kind of things can be expected from a brand new release.\n-Unless you have TrackIR, or patience enough to use hat controls, looking around to see oncoming traffic can be a pain in the neck.\n-You only start with two types of trucks (though customizable many different ways), mods can help fix that and SCS plans to release more trucks for free in future updates.\n\nATS has many features that ETS2 did and some of its very own.\n\n-Ability to manage multiple garages, trucks and hire drivers/run your own company.\n-Radiostations with relevant radio stations such as country, classic rock, metal, alternative and other genres.\n-Weight stations, sometimes it will require you to pull in to get a truck inspection.\n-Pretty good recreations of landmarks such as the golden gate bridge.\n-The ability to do some pretty heavy customization/personalization of your truck, mods further enhancing this.\n-Many more\n\n\nIf you were a fan of Euro Truck Simulator 2, you'll definitely like American Truck Simulator, the game is well worth $20.00 in my opinion and i really find it enjoyable, being able to drive around on such a wide open expanse, with your choice of music is therapeutic in nature and is really good for stress relief and escapism.\n\nThe attention to detail is great and you can get some true enjoyment from it. I'd definitely reccomend this game to any simulation fan, it's a really enjoyable experience and has alot of future potential as well.","February 7","true","110.0"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","2"

However, I find this game still very fun and challenging AND worth the money.\n\nThe scenery is completely different and the challenge is there. You get to choose while delivering if you want to take the easy way out: automatic parking, the easy challenge: parking in an easy spot or to pick the advanced spot. You get more XP for taking a tougher challenge.  I think that this game is no where near done. It lacks diversity  after a while and new things to unlock, but you can't flat out compare Euro truck simulator 2 with American truck simulator. ATS will be greater or equal to ETS2 in the future as SCS has shown in the past with ETS2.\n\n7/7","February 4","true","7.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Only 2 trucks but more to come. Only 2 states but more to come. And the last this is SPEEDING TICKETS and the SPEED LIMIT of this game like holy ♥♥♥♥, they give you tickets for days and $1000 for each... for only going like 6 more than the speed limit, that is annoying. Also the off and on ramps need to be adjusted they are too short and also when you enter a city that goes from 70mph to 30mph real quick and guess what THERES A ♥♥♥♥ING COP READY FOR YO ♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥ TO GIVE YOU A TICKET.\n\n10/10 WOULD GET A TICKET AGAIN, GREAT ♥♥♥♥ING GAME\n\nIF YOU LOOK AT IT THERES ONLY LIKE 1 PROBLEM WHICH IS THE SPEED TICKETS AND SPEED LIMIT.

However let us not forget how Euro Truck Simulator 2 began, it started as German Truck Simulator. And UK Truck Simulator. Locking you to only Germany and UK (In 2 different releases.)\n\nSo is the lack of States a problem for American Truck Simulator? I think not. Right now it causes some issues of repetativeness as you will very quickly span the map, however it is just the beginning. The lack of truck veriety however is disapointing, license limitations or not I would rather they took the Euro Truck Simulator approach and released fictional brands for the trucks until they we're able to secure a licenses.\n\nAt the moment as American Truck Simulator is today I feel Euro Truck Simulator 2 is a better buy, however I see lots of potential for American Truck Simulator to get to the same level in time, and I just hope it doesn't take too much time to get there.","March 20","true","42.0"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

I'm not talking about the Extreme Trucker versions, I'm talking about the originals. Hard Truck, Haulin, Convoy etc. Now this. This game seems to me like an extreme overhaul of the 18WoS games. There's HD graphics, supreme truck customization (except for custom liveries), a wide range of companies and loads, and, a feature used in 18WoS Haulin, hired drivers. Not only that, the immersion factor within the terrain and the trucks is through the roof. It's not just haulin loads any more. It now lets you enjoy the view.

So it is for me. I did not buy ETS2 because it is Europe and I have enough of it in Scania Truck Driving Simulator.\n\nWhile ATS was released with several annoying bugs and oversights, like abundance of police cars and thus penalties for speeding just over 1 mph (fixed with 1.1 patch), insufficient speed limit sign placement along with sudden changes of speed limits and even traffic lights on some Interstates, as well as STOP signs on intersections controlled by traffic lights, or on-ramps leading to dedicated lanes and yet having YIELD signs, it is still a great game for anyone interested in this genre.\n\nLong time ETS2 players might be a bit dissapointed by small number of enhancements, but everything is new to me and I am having fun.

SCS did an amazing job  with graphic details.\n\nI do, however, have a few issues with the game.  These are mostly minor things that don't  take away from the gameplay overall.  I'm thoroughly loving this game.\n\n1)  Speeding tickets are 1k each, even if you'ree only going 5 miles over.  That's pretty extreme and not realistic.\n\n2) Cops are EVERYWHERE.  I love seeing the cops around, but it gets to be a little too much when every fourth or fifth car you see is a police car.\n\n3) I've encountered certain spots in gas stations that the truck simply cannot go over.  I found this out initially when delivering fuel.  My cab could go over the spot, but my trailer wheels would get stuck and force me to skip parking.\n\n4) Traffic speeds!  Cars will go much faster than you all the time, even if you're going 55mph, they will fly by you.  If we have a set speed limit, the AI needs one, too.","February 4","true","110.6"," 10 of 20 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","10","20","0","0"

The buildings, scenery, vehicles, and roadside objects look even better. They went so far that they even implemented the box vans that UPS and FedEx use ito the game! The gameplay is hands down amazing. The trucks look EXTREMELY realistic and they drive like the real thing (if you're using a steering wheel). The sounds are also spot on.\n\nOne thing I really like is the implementation of police cruisers that will surprise you and sound their siren when you try the old speed-on-the-highway move from ETS2.\n\nLong story short: ATS = ETS2 x 9000 + MERICA!","February 5","true","204.4"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","3","6","0","0"

We don't want to release the game before it is ready. A huge hypefest about all the new features and blah blah this and it will be so worth the wait we promise. So it was FINALLY released and what did we get for our money? Two count them on two fingers yes 2 trucks and 2 trucks that have minimum modifications compared to the OLDER  game ETS2.  Now  I'm trying to notice what is really NEW and find mostly really irritating things like a cop on every corner giving me $1000.00 dollar tickets every 10 seconds.. Being ticketed for right turns on red which last time I checked was legal in America. Then started looking closer at the "new details" and find some more really irritating things like concrete barriers that look like some child playing with their toys placed them willy nilly so as to create a potential hazard every 100 yrds.  Light standards with huge concrete bases so close to the lane that you would not dare travel in that lane! Hello SCS people are using keyboards to steer their trucks and you put all this crap right where someone is most likely to run into it and cause huge amounts of damage. Now lets talk about some really dumb stuff that makes me just shake my head in disbelief.  The developer paid someone to put stop signs at the intersections that already have traffic lights. No wonder it took so long to get this thing to market.  Most of the "cities" if you want to call them that are so small that they don't even have a garage or gas station. Talk about sparse. Heck most of its desert country whats so dam hard about putting up a few cactus and some brown vegetation? Now lets talk about sound quality. Let me put it this way, the first time I heard the "horn" on either of the 2 trucks it reminded me of the clowns car at the circus. Thats the best you can do in the three years I waited ? Can I recommend this piece of unfinished stuff?  A BIG thumbs down. I could give a rats patooty about all the new flare and other superfluous nonsense. I want my tuned trucks back, I want the dual trailers that were supposedly going to be part of ATS and some form of LAN connectivity. SCS you have lost sight of what your customers want and have chosen instead to offer a dumbed down unfinished product and sell ridiculous DLC addons such as your accessories DLC and paint job DLC's and heavy loads bs. At this rate it will take another three years just to fix what you just released instead of making any real progress.","February 5","false","448.5"," 7 of 14 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","7","14","0","0"

And as of right now, only has two trucks to choose from. So the game is currently lacking content wise, only because this was built from the ground up, and there will be more content released for it in the future, some probably through free updates and others through purchases, it's up to the company for what they do. Even though it's a decent game right now, it cannot be recommened in its current state due to being incomplete content wise (trucks to choose from, states to go to, etc).\n\nI may come back to this in the future to change my review, so stay tuned for the *update.\n\n\n\n*I'd like to point out now that this will be way later on in the future, when there are more states and more vehicles to choose from. My best guess is that it would be at least by late 2017 at best, and early 2019 at the latest, when I believe that a sizeable amount of the game might be completed, meaning more content added to the game.

Yes, I do realize the game is very new and WIP.\n\nStuff I do like\nControls and plays much the same as ETS2 - hooray for XB360 gamepads!\nGame is graphically beautiful!\nThe delivery parking options are a very much welcome addition. I've even found myself having to stop, think, and plan how I'm going to get a trailer into a tight spot.\nFines for violations are actually a real concern; even crippling!\nBut there's this one thing that's been wrecking it for me...\n\nAsk just about anyone from anywhere else in the world what one of his or her major first impressions will be when visiting the United States, and I can all but guarantee one of them will be a sense of awe at how vast and wide open this land feels. That sense of openness is lost in this game.\n\nCities such as Los Angeles and Carlsbad, CA feel practically next door to each other, when it reality, they are over 80 miles apart through an almost entirely urbanized landscape. In game, the trips takes less time than a quick run to the corner store when the real run in a 74' truck lasts the better part of 2 hours. This feels even more pronounced when making the longest in-game trips; the sense of distance simply isn't there.\n\nRather surprisingly, I've recently learned the map scaling is significantly smaller than it was in ETS2. As a result, the game world feels disappointingly truncated. As others have noted, essential elements such as highway on-ramps are very short - gaining enough speed to safely merge with traffic is nigh impossible. What would normally be a challenging decent down Donner Pass, requiring careful planning and concentration, feels like it's over and gone in just a few seconds. As others have said, I feel this effectively breaks the immersion aspect of the game.\n\nOther minor quibbles\nNo, you cannot drive for 14 hours. You get 11 hours in a 14 hour window\nWe generally don't fuel our trucks with 53' trailers at a typical gas station. There are truck stops for that...\n..and speaking of truck stops, we usually don't go about "nosing in" to parking spots!\nI understand my critique is very harsh, but that's because I've done and do this for a living\n\nIn summary, I feel as though I'm "playing at" trucking with toys as a kid, rather than engaging in any sort of simulation. At this stage, the game feels like a $20.00 demo - speaking of demos; I hear they've released one, so go get it!\n\nIf you're looking to jump in the cab a well-modeled American truck and go about having some easy fun gallivanting about California and Nevada, then you'll likely enjoy this one. The game has a long way to go, but that also means it's got lots of new content ahead! Also - MODS!!! :D\n\nI would not recommend this game to anyone seeking a more immersive simulation-type experience, it simply isn't there.\n\nBe safe out there!\n-Red","February 10","false","33.7"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"

You just throw money at them playing the same thing until you get bored grinding for in-game money to upgrade yo shi t.\n\nThe Good\nWell, if you're a new guy/lass in the truck simulator world, ATS is a good way to spend your hard earned cash and get bored in about 5 hours. You get nice graphics, a decently sized map, somewhat realistic truck handling and "tons" of work to do.\n\nThe Bad\nIf you're like me and have gone through all the truck simulator games from the first 18WoS to this crap, I'll let you know this has nothing over previous titles but improved graphics and smarter traffic. The developer is clearly trying to get some cash one more time from enthusiasts pulling the same maneuver all over again.  I mean, after 3 years since European Truck Simulator was released, they come with a copy of that taking place on the East Side of the USA this time, saying it's their biggest s h i t so far and even more good things are about to happen. Well, the cake is a lie...\n\nI know there is copyright work to be done before using real trucks in game, but all they managed to get so far are three fkin truck models... THREE ! And two of them sound and feel exactly the same. There's also no visual damage and everything stays nice and shiny forever, you know, like a truck in the real world.\n\nAnd what do you think they did next? They came up with a 3EUR DLC that allows you to chage rims and tires... fkin rims and tires, mate... just like it's the 2000's again and we all want to play NFS Underground but with trucks this time. I hope the next one adds neons and wings...\n\nSeriously, how about adding some realistic damage instead of some percentages shown in tiny boxes next to the truck in diagnose mode? Or, how about the trucks getting dirty, oily or dusty depending where you drive them? Or even better, make the game really put you in the driver's skin; get out of the truck to couple/uncouple the tailer, refuel, repair a flat tire to make the game a bit more tricky to play. It just gets so damn boring after about 5 hours of playtime. And also make sure you use the ingame currency a bit more accurate.... who the hell spends 180K to upgrade to a medium garage but only 100k to upgrade to a really big garage?\n\nI can only hope that at least the workshop enthusiasts will put out more trucks and dirty/oily/rusty skins. I lost my faith in SCS. Don't buy this recycled garbage if it's not on sale for about 2 bucks....","April 23","false","69.4"," 29 of 59 people (49%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","49","29","59","7","1"

The trucks are too static - they barely move around. The physics are absolute crap. While pulling a trailer and accerlating, the torque should slightly twist the chassis - nope. Not only does it not do this, the truck literally doesn't move at all. I'm not kidding. Sure, your interior camera might move up and down when you go up/down a hill but that's all you get. Put the clutch in and rev it; again, truck doesn't move at all. Go over a bump or something and the truck barely moves. There is zero horizontal movement.\n\nAnother thing that drives me nuts is how easy your truck/trailer will get stuck on the slightest thing - it's incredibly frustrating. Your trailers tires will slightly rub against something and it brings your truck to a complete hault. You can floor it in a low gear - nothing. You're not even stuck - the tires are simply just touching a curb. It's a joke. Slightly rubbing against any surface is like someone tied your rear axle to an imoveable object - it's made me rage quit several times.\n\nI know you've probably heard this before but it really is an issue - the scale. I live in California and I'm very familiar with it. I'm so let down by how small it feels and how redundant it is. Do the developers realize not all of California is a god damn desert? Most of it is green and yet the entire map looks dry and gross, not to mention the complete lack of accurate geography. Where is the bay area? San Jose is the 10th largest city in the United States and it's no where to be found. What really chaps my ♥♥♥ is the fact that they use some of the same freeway interchanges from Euro Truck Simulator 2 which is incredibly frustrating because no where in California do the freeways intersect like that. So much lost potential. I watched a YouTube video of 18 Wheels of Steel or something and, despite the old and awful graphics, the freeways at least looked like the actual freeways we have in California. So why they couldn't do that again is beyond me. I know they're capable of making accurate looking landscape and freeway systems - they just refuse to do it.\nAlso, stop signs at intersections with traffic lights... really? Doesn't exist. Even at stop signs with no traffic lights they still can't get it right as they decided to angle the limit line almost anywhere there is a limit line. Again, if the game didn't call itself a simulator, I could give it a break on some of this stuff but how hard is it to draw a straight line? All of our limit lines in Californiaare straight and simplistic with very few execptions.\n\nThis game had potential but they really let me down. It's genuanly laughable that it has "Simulator" in it's name. Someone please explain to me what it's simulating because it's not trucks or California. Might as well call Grand Theft Auto a simulator by SCS' standards. If it's ever on sale for five bucks, then it might be worth it. Until then, it's a profound failure.","February 7","false","101.7"," 27 of 55 people (49%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","49","27","55","4","0"

I had scaling on 400% and max graphics and was super smooth!\n\nAudio: The audio is the same as Euro Truck sim, with some added effects coming from the world.  It is truck noises... I turned off the radio and music because I found it annoying!\n\nControls: This is where I got annoyed! I am using an Xbox One controller (X360 works too) but I had some problems setting it up and it took me a while because of the weird issue with the acceleration with the game!\n\nGameplay: The gameplay is the same as Euro Truck Simulator 2, which I did not play much off as I only played the multiplayer mod, which I am thankful to say, this version now has!\n(I am unsure if ETS2 has these features but I am detailing them from ATS) - The nice fact you can hire drivers, buy trucks for them and a little more, buy a garage, upgrade it and semi customise the trucks and get your drivers to go on missions to earn you some more money is pretty awesome.  The detail in this version I find is a lot more extreme, to the point when driving around the scenery actually has things going on, there are no pedestrians on the streets, but they are in cars and wandering around a complex and outside buidings IN a small area, but there are planes flying over dusting their fields, police following people, helicopters and actual things to look at.\n\nThere is a multiplayer mod for this game already and it is pure amazing, I love everything about it.  The only problem is, there is there NO traffic at all, not even police cars on the road... The only people on the road are other players, that is it! Kinda sad!\nAlso is the idiots who think this game is GTA and race around, cutting on the pavement, ramming and so much more, but thankfully the Admins are very fast to actually ban them which is awesome, and there is very little of these people and players actually play the game properly mostly.  Again making this enjoyable!\n\nThe game plays more or less the same as ETS2 and is enjoyable and will be a better version when more content has arrived, so on that basis... Yes, I would recommend this game a a step up from ETS2","February 6","true","41.7"," 13 of 27 people (48%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","48","13","27","0","0"

The fines are more expensive than it was in ETS2 and bascially this is about trucking under the law (like most SCS trucking games were about) because if you think you want to break the law then you'll go bankrupt in minutes.

Is it worth it?\nReview written on 04/02/16\n\nAmerican Truck Simulator is basically Euro Truck Simulator 2, set in the West coast of the USA. So if you didn't like Euro Truck Simulator 2, you're probably not going to enjoy this Sim.\n\nGeneral jist of the game (For New Players)\nSo just like ETS2, you start off by creating your new, exciting delivery company and character. You then take on a few quick delivery jobs around California and Nevada (More states coming soon). Eventually, you can get loans which then allow you to purchase your own truck so you can do freight jobs where you use your own equipment. (You get more money for this)\n\nYou can then upgrade your garage to allow more spaces for employees, buy more trucks and hire employees to make more money. There is a skill tree and as you level and progress through the game, you can unlock delivery jobs such as hauling Dynamite, gassess and whatnot.\n\nThe Pros\n\nThe game is highly addictive if you're the type of person that gets satisfaction from a mundane task; it's the thought of developing your own company and working really hard to get by which is really fun. After quite a few hours on this game already, I can tell I'm quite hooked and I find that driving around isn't as boring as it looks.\n\nThe driving is just as good as ETS2, the physics are really decent and it's pretty damn realistic. But then again, I'm not a truck driver, so how would I know?\n\nMore content coming soon! This game only has 2 states so far and only two truck brands, but more is on the way, such as the Arizona state and a few more truck brands.\n\nThe Cons\n\nThis game like every other Simulator, is a massive grind and I can see myself eventually getting bored or tired of repeating myself. But you've got to remember, it is a Simulator and you're supposed to work hard for little reward.\n\nThe lack of states in this game is slightly dissapointing as you feel like there should be more places to go, however I found that after my current play time, I have seen a lot and there's still a lot to see. There are also only two car brands which is a shame as there's not much choice in what truck to buy at the start. It's 50/50 chance you'll get the same truck as me.\n\nSpeed Limits! Every country has them, but God damn! I want to scream when I'm in a 55 Mph zone when you could clearly do 70! And don't get me started on the 30 Mph limit, it's so painful!\n\nConclusion\n\nIf you fancy giving the game a go, why not? It's really good for the price of £14.99 and I'd reccommend at least trying it. Please remember, it is a Simulator and can be boring; if you're the type of person that just wants to get going immediately and shoot people, this isn't for you.\n\nI am enjoying the game a lot and had to force myself to come off so I could make the badge. I'm going to go to bed, wake up, go to college, go home, and play this all evening... Again.","February 3","true","31.1"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","7","15","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gwait/recommended/270880/","gwait","gwait","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gwait/","805 products in account","As someone who has played ETS2 previously, the game is similar to ETS2, but that doesn't mean that new features have not been added to make the game still interesting.\n\nOne of the negative things I've noticed right away was that you get a LOT of speeding tickets very frequently even if the speed limit has just changed and you haven't had the time to slow down to the proper speed limit, this can be very hard as you can quickly get into negative balance if you're just starting out. A fix that I found if you don't want to get any fines at all (obviously defeats the purpose of the game, but very useful if you're just starting off) is to go into My Documents\ATS\yourProfile\ and open the config.cfg file. Once the file has been opened, change "g_police "1"" to 0 and save the file, this won't get you any fines.\n\nThe frequent ticket problem where a player did not have enough time to react to a speed limit before being fined has been fixed by the developers, which just further makes my point stronger that the developers are constantly working on this game and listening to the community.\n\nAnother thing I've noticed is that I sometimes get random lag spike for about 1 second every so often which is quite annoying.There is obviously lack of content in the current game such as that there's only two three trucks currently available or that only two states are currently available. This is going to be expanded upon in the future as a new state that is currently in development has already been announced that it will be free in the future.\n\nFinally, the AI is still messed up and still needs further improvement, in my opinion.\n\nNow moving onto the positive things I've noticed is that the game has better time scaling where time progresses faster than it used to in ETS2. There are also new additions such as weight scaling (you get told by police to weight your cargo), new delivery aspect where you can select out of three options which are to either skip parking your truck, easy mode parking or hard mode parking. It also offers great support for steering wheels (which is obviously essential).\n\nThere are also lots of new companies, new cargo that will test your skills as a trucker whether it is a cargo that weights a lot, or cargo that is long (up to 53ft!). And to top it off, there's a new map , which means that there are new roads and new scenery (such as jets, passenger planes, air balloons, helicopters, crop dusters, etc), there are also tumbleweeds that roll across the road which I thought is a pretty neat addition.\n\nSo, is it worth it?\n\nI'd say yes, it's worth it. There is obvious lack of content at the current moment but the game is still interesting and has enough content to enjoy it, and the game will still be expanding further where new states, new trucks are added. The developers communicate with the community and I have no doubt that only good things will come in the future.\n\nSince the first version of this review, a new truck (Kenworth W900) has been released as a free DLC to the game owners. The new state (will also be free) and further new trucks are also in development. An unofficial Multiplayer mod has also been released for ATS, meaning you can now play with your friends, along with other 2,000 players in a server.\n\nThe game has many mods available to use to enhance upon the original game, if you like that sort of stuff.","February 2","true","47.7"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","7","15","0","2"

Expect a greedy police officer around every corner to steal yet another $1,400 just for going a measly 40 mp/h above the speed limit.\n\nI love this game. It taught me to never become a truck driver or I would end up overdrafting my bank account 3 times a day 7 days a week, as well as suffer daily concussions due to my truck flipping at least twice a day.","February 3","true","43.6"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","6","13","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/proper_noun/recommended/270880/","proper_noun","Proper Noun","http://steamcommunity.com/id/proper_noun/","239 products in account","Well, I've spent far too much of my time on this game following its release.\n\ntl;dr: Euro Truck Simulator 2 is still a better value, and likely to go on a very cheap sale sooner and more often. ATS is slightly more technically advanced and detailed, but has less content.\n\nSo why did I thumb this up?\n\nTo understand why, it might be more fair to compare this game to the ETS2: Scandinavia DLC release. It was in Scandinavia that SCS started really putting this level of love and beauty into the visual environment, and ATS seems to incorporate most or all of the under-the-hood upgrades ETS2 has gotten, as of Scandinavia. I would also tend to say Scandinavia holds less overall content. That all aside, I'll go into a list of positive and negative things about this game, as I've encountered them thus far.\n\nPositive:\n\n+UPDATED: The multiplayer mod is available.\n\n+UPDATED: The trucks and trailers are both larger than in ETS2, which can introduce new challenges in driving and tight-space maneuvering.\n\n+UPDATED: Trucks come with insurance when you purchase them, reducing the cost of repairs substantially. This element of gameplay simply wasn't present in ETS2, where you would simply pay the entirety of every repair bill on your own vehicle.\n\n+The environment is wonderful! I'm especially pleased with the design of the urban areas, which feature places that just feel more like downtown and residential areas than anything in ETS2 or ETS2: Going East, where almost everything is an industrial district or shipping yard. San Francisco in particular was lovely.\n\n+Trailers just feel like they have more real inertia than in ETS2. Or maybe the default braking strength is just weaker; I'm quite pleased either way.\n\n+The new parking system is well-presented and gives real options for new, intermediate, and more advanced drivers.\n\n+The interface and controls may not have been changed substantially from ETS2 to ATS, but that's a good thing! The ETS2 interface was clean and very well-presented; there's no need to fix what isn't broken.\n\n+The system for hiring new drivers, giving them trucks, and letting them make money for you does not appear to have changed substantially from ETS2, except for the payouts feeling smaller. Again, this is a good thing--the system worked well in ETS2, and it works well here.\n\n+The traffic density is quite good. It's high enough to make the roads feel alive, but not high enough to make them feel congested.\n\n+E-Pass toll booths!\n\n+The economy feels a bit "tougher" than the economy in ETS2. What you pay for things hasn't changed, but job payouts feel like they've gone down a fair bit. You may also take this as a negative thing if that's not to your taste.\n\n+Fuel tanks are smaller, starting out, and simply don't last as long. This combines with weight station and rest stops (if you play with fatigue enabled) to produce a higher-maintenance experience without, at the same time, being particularly obtrusive. This could also be taken as a negative thing, if it's not to your taste.\n\n+Due to incorporation of ETS2's interface and engine, the game was mod-ready on day one.\n\n+It doesn't really feel all that sparse on content, and knowing that the first couple of states added (including Nevada, included with launch) will probably be free patches instead of paid DLC is consoling.\n\n+A broader camera range within the cab enables a better view of the sleeper than is available in ETS2. This isn't much, but hey, a plus is a plus.\n\n+It's only US$20, cheaper even than ETS2 and 1/3 the price of most new releases.\n\n\n\nNegative:\n\n-You get what you pay for. The content is, as others have said, a touch on the small and sparse side. There isn't all that much land. There are only two trucks, with almost no variety - even the engines are the same, and they sound identical. The only reason to pick one truck over the other is its price (the Peterbilt is cheaper) and cabin aesthetics (I prefer the Kenworth). This could, indeed, be understood as an official mod to ETS2 with no attachment points to the earlier game.\n\nUPDATED -- There are now three trucks. The new Kenworth W900 looks and sounds very different, as it should (being an older model IRL). The W900 also feels quite different to drive due in the main to size differences.\n\n-Framerates feel a little less stable on my mediocre system (OC'd G3258, OC'd Radeon 7770 GHz Ed., 8GB @1333MHz DDR3) than on ETS2. It seems related to the higher volume of traffic, especially downtown (and at night, when there are so many more light sources to map out).\n\n-I had a bug shortly after starting the tutorial mission where the game paused on a black screen, and would not unpause. I had to kill the game and restart, but never had the issue again. That could indicate some small technical issues.\n\nNot covered:\n\n-I do not have a wheel and pedals, and can't speak for that element of the simulator experience.\n-I do not drive a truck IRL, and can't speak for the driving element of the simulator experience.\n-I haven't been this far west in the United States, and can't speak for the accuracy of the landscape.\n\n\nOverall, I like this game, and I'd like to see more of it. I don't regret buying it, but right now, ETS2 is the better value, and more likely to be on sale for less money - although without the DLC, it doesn't really have the beauty and variety you'll find in Scandinavia and in ATS. If you want better value for your money (better, because I'm not going to say this is bad value for the money), buy ETS2 and maybe the major expansion packs. If you really like driving in the United States or put a disproportionately high value on aesthetics, try this game.","February 3","true","62.9"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

First off I have been looking forward to playing this since the first day I heard it was in development. Now you could call me a fanboy for ATS, but I have hundreds of hours on ETS2. First i'd like to point out the obvious facts that we all know and seem to be the griping points about the game to which I have no problem with, two trucks ( with different configurations ) and two states with 30 cities total. This was known if you read any of the dev's latest pre release blogs. Is it ETS2 quality yet?, no, but neither was ETS2 until the community embraced it and helped the dev's push it to what it has become, an absolutely AMAZING game. The same can and hopefully will be applied to ATS. Yes the initial release is a little bleak, the stock truck sounds are decent, the entire economy is modeled on the ETS platform ( which works perfectly since any of us that have played ETS are very familiar with ) Another gripe ive seen is that the graphics are sub par to ETS2. Keep in mind they went for a grittier look seeing how we're out in the desert not everything is pretty and polished its more sandblasted and rusty.\nNow if you can look past the initial lack of features continue to follow me. Originally only the boxed retail version of this game was to get any DLC, which the dev's generously gave ALL of us for free including Arizona when it becomes available. Couple that with the fact that they've tripled their manpower to work on finishing the game while keeping up with updating ETS2 thats a lot of work for a smaller software company to take on. I can only look forward to seeing the amazing direction this game is going to progress in the future seeing how the modding community is already full bore churning out content on release day. Here's how I rate the game\n\n- Same addictive game play as ETS2\n- New features such as parking methods and weigh stations\n- Very large map for only 30 cities\n- improved AI traffic\n- mesmerizing scenery transitions\n\nI honestly have no complaints with the game other than a minor gripe about the fine amounts and the "rolling radars" and a few bugs that obviously are going to be in a new game but overall I foresee myself enjoying hundreds of hours on this title as it progresses. Hands down I would highly recommend this game to a friend","February 3","true","328.9"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","45","5","11","0","0"

I have come over from ETS 2 so i knew what to expect and what not to expect. There is not alot of difference in the games, but then again is there truely alot of difference in driving big rigs in Europe and North America? You move cargo from this city to that city for a transportation fee. On the flip side youve promised to transport it and delieve it as youve picked it up or you face penalties.\n\nNow as ive seen people complain a little bit about lack of content. You are very much right, there isn't alot here.. YET..\ni think if we can expect half of the love the SCS has put into ETS 2 we will be more than pleased. And for those that say they dont want the DLC's and for content to be thrown in for free, Realize that SCS has released this in knowing there wasnt alot and have adjusted the price accordingly. $20 is not a bad price and i was more than happy to pay. i believe as the game is, it is worth $20.  I personally will be willing to pay for Reigons (the mountain states, the midwestern states, the east coast) and different trucks (although i believe they will be added in free of charge)\n\nSo as a final verdict, I give this game a solid 7/10\n\nThe game is what they say it is, and this score will rise once the rest of the game has fleshed out more in reigons and trucks.","February 5","true","29.9"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

But you can have a truck, and build your own truck empire in this game.\n\nTruck model details are great, and you can mod your trucks. I advise newbees get some money & experience points mod to make it faster to unlock more parts and abilities, and doing this won't affect the gaming experience at all and it makes your early stage more enjoyable.\n\nDriving physics may not be very excellent, sound neither. There are many mods to improve these, but don't expect too much for the game engine maybe a little bit outdated.\n\nThe core fun part of this game is driving truck, transporting your cargo from one place to another, and do the parking, and enjoy the beautiful scene outside.\n\nThe carbine interior is detailly made. But if player can move inside choose to sit on co-driver seat, sleep in the bed, or poop in the toilet, or do something else inside, there will be more fun.\n\nThe environment is good, but not better than that in the European Truck Simulator 2. Maybe it's because Europe is more beautiful than in America?\n\nThere is no damage model at all. You crash, you pay, and you watch yourself not getting any trouble any more. If you are grounded on the road, call emergency recovery.\n\nI personally wish to have some heavy military trucks to drive, such as the one that can transport Abrams main battle tank.\n\nThis is a game that for relax, enjoy the driving and the landscape.

When they told us that it was only going to come with California, I was still going to be okay with it, I just wanted to drive my Peterbilt 389 in the U.S instead of those tiny European roads. Now that ATS has released, I can say that I am greatly impressed by it. The amount of detail that went in to the states of California and Nevada is unbelievable. Even though its running on the same engine as Euro Truck 2, it still feels like a new experience for me. It is definitley a step up from the bland cities of Euro Truck.\nThings I don't like:\n1. The lack of long roads. One thing I enjoyed about Euro Truck was being able to stay on one highway for a long time and just enjoy the journey on the road. On nearly every journey on ATS, there are a number of turns on to different highways, usually dont stay on one for over 5 minutes\n2. Only coming with two trucks. Yes, I know there are going to be a ton of new mods that are going to make up for it, but I was looking forward to driving more high quality trucks from SCS. I am looking forward to when they do put more in the game.\n3. The weigh stations. One of the biggest things I was looking forward to was learning how to do the weigh stations and what they would be like. Well, as of now, they don't do anything. The ones at the rest stops literally do not do anything, no icons or anything. They are just there. The ones on the highway will randomly ask you to pull in for a vehicle inspection. When you get there, you just stop on the icon and press enter and they will tell you to continue. You dont get to know the weight of your cargo or anything.

You start out by choosing where you want to set up your first little base of operations and then you’re master of your own haulage destiny.\n\nUnfortunately you don’t start with any money, driving skills or even a truck of your own, you’re going to need to earn, learn and buy these things as you play.\n\n\nEarn and Learn\n\nThe “earning and learning” elements initially come from the successful completion of “quick jobs” which you’ll find available to you from the various locales scattered across the map.\nThese jobs vary in length and payment; you’ll find yourself hauling all sorts of cargo across the states.\n\nYou’re working for the metaphorical “Man” with these jobs though so you won’t earn as much as you would if you were your own boss, but as you haven’t got your own truck when you first start out, running these contracts in the loaner rigs provided is the only way you’re going to earn a buck.\n\nWhen you’ve finished browsing the list of jobs currently available to you, you’ll pick a contract you like the sound of (whether that’s because it pays well, you like the idea of hauling a particular cargo type, or you think it might push some interesting scenery past  your windows).\n\nA click of a button later and you’ll find yourself sitting in your borrowed rig; trailer hooked up and destination already set in the sat nav.\n\nIt’s time to get trucking!\n\n\nGrand Truck Auto\n\nNow you’re sitting behind the wheel of a big rig, trundling along the byways and cruising down the highways it’s important to keep in mind that this is a simulation title, not a joy ride in Grand Theft Auto.\nYou’re being paid to complete a delivery job.\n\nRunning red lights, racing past speed cameras and smashing other vehicles off the asphalt (as tempting as it might be) could result in some hefty fines, if you’re saving up to buy your own rig, this is not a good thing.\n\n\nDoes it come with Fluffy Dice?\n\nTraffic transgressions aside, you’ll eventually reach a point where you’ve got a tidy sum of money burning a hole in your pocket. Whether this is through the diligent completion of delivery jobs or the quick fix solution of a crippling bank loan is up to you, but sooner or later you’ll find yourself touring the dealerships to pick out a truck of your very own.\n\nWhen you’ve got your heart set on a rig, the dealer is going to tempt you with a wealth of optional extras from the cosmetic to the mechanical and like a kid in a sweetshop; you’re going to want them all.\n\n\nRig Responsibilities\n\nWith your chest full of pride and your wallet empty of money, you’ll now be the proud owner of your own truck. It’s time to stop making money for “The Man” and start making it for yourself.\nYou’re no longer tied to the “quick job” market, you can take contracts directly now and cut out the middle man.\n\nThe downside of this is that now you’re using your own vehicle; you’re going to need to look after it, give it petrol to drink and pay to have it fixed up if it gets “poorly”.\n\nYou need to look after yourself too, drive for too long without rest and you’re going to get drowsy. Falling asleep at the wheel can really ruin your day (and your truck) so rest stops in lay-bys are a must on long drives.\n\n\nBigger, Better, Faster, Stronger\n\nAs well as getting rich from completing all these contracts, there’s also the added bonus of increasing your own driving skills, this is done with an almost RPG like experience levelling system.\nComplete a contract quickly without smashing up your truck and you’ll gain experience; gain enough and you’ll ...

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/evilsatanist/recommended/270880/","evilsatanist","OppositeOfGod","http://steamcommunity.com/id/evilsatanist/","290 products in account","I just barely recommended this game, and my opinion is subject to change as the game progresses; but as of now, my review is as follows.\n\nI am an American trucker. I have been for a while now. I own my own rig. I run all 48 states, plus Canada and Alaska. I played ETS2 more than any other game in the past 30 years. (even more than super mario) I loved that game. It was the first simulation game for trucking that came anywhere near the real thing. Now, I do not live in Europe. I cannot say how similar it actually is to true Euro Trucking. Well, this is American Truck Simulator and I am an American trucker, so certain things do stick out to me. For one, no where in the USA, will you have an interstate with a state road just turning into it. You'll never find that. You will have a long on ramp and off ramp for these. Every single time. There are no splits in the interstate. Also, the layout of the truck stops is way too similar to ETS2, and nowhere near similar to true American truck stops. Yeah, I see that there are some legal issues dealing with naming the big truck stops (Loves, Petro, Pilot, Flying J, TA), but don't take something that is never a truck stop (Chevron) and turn it into one. Also, you'll never find a truck stop that just turns off of the interstate. You'll always take an exit, go a few blocks down and then it will be all by itself or surrounded by other buildings. I was really hoping that this would be more accurate. Some truckstops are challenging, while others are a cake walk. However, you will never find a truck stop that pulls off of the interstate like a rest area, and you will never find a truck stop with parallel parking. It will always be back in parking.\n\nNow onto the trucks. I get it, the game is new. But why only 2 trucks to start out with? Maybe I'm playing it wrong, but maybe not. I'm not going to touch too much on this; but I will say I hope to see more trucks appear very soon. (Not just models, but other makes also)\n\nMy biggest beef, besides the interstate shortcomings, is the fact that the game devs decided to put this in California. (Or as some truckers call it, Commiefornia) This is the single worst state to drive a truck in. It is far from the "American spirit" in regards to trucking. It has the slowest speed limit, the highest emissions laws, and the most corrupt state Department of Transportation in the country. If this game were to really see the heart of American trucking, they should have started it off in the Midwest or the South. Anywhere from Kansas to Texas would have been best. Something with a high agriculture outport, high manufacturing, and even high livestock. But no, we had to go with California, who imports most of what they ship from China. Oh well, I can only hope that more states will be added, and soon. I see that Arizona is next on the list to be released, and I am just curious as to what cities they are planning on introducing, and what they believe actually ships out of Arizona. Should be interesting to see.\n\nI really also wish that the backing in the game was harder. I see that it has gotten more difficult from ETS2, but it is FAR from being accurate with some of the shippers and receivers around this country. How about some 90 degree blind side alley backs? Or how about some blindside parallel parks for flatbeds? These are what truckers have to deal with daily here; so why not throw a few, or a ton, of them into the game? It would add more of a challenge while, at the same time, becoming a bit more realistic.\n\nNow, I did give this a "yes I would recommend" vote. It is a fun simulation, and for what it's worth, the simulation is fairly accurate. You won't find a better trucking simulator out there. Hell, even trucking schools have worse software to teach people how to drive a truck. This is a cheap game, at only $20, but it has amazing potential. I hope to see this game live up to my expectations, especially after having waited so long to get it.\n\nIf you are not a trucker, this game will be great for you. If you are a trucker, you'll find the same gripes about it as I did; but you'll still play it.","February 14","true","7.6"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

If you liked ETS2, you'll like ATS.\n\nAs is, at release, the ATS map is pretty darn small, averaging 600 to 700 miles end-to-end. Yeah if I manually configure the SatNav to go into smaller, undiscovered roads, I might get 900 miles... maybe.\n\nPersonally, I somehow find that American important locations in towns and cities, as depicted in the game, are spread too far apart. You can drive a couple of minutes to get to the company you want to take a job for, or to get to a service centre to get your truck repaired/upgraded. This eats into you "awake time" in the game, and you start yawning very quickly (to me) while on the road.\n\nPlus, rest stops seem to be rather scarce in America when compared to Europe. Good thing is, you don't get fined for not sleeping. Speed limit signs are almost non-existent. Woe be to you if you were in the process of slowing down from 70 to 30 when approaching a city, and a cop car happens to pass you - you get fined.....EVEN WHEN YOU'RE SLOWING DOWN.\n\nOn the up-side - No speed cameras :)\n\n","February 14","true","22.4"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","4"

When they told us that it was only going to come with California, I was still going to be okay with it, I just wanted to drive my Peterbilt 389 in the U.S instead of those tiny European roads. Now that ATS has released, I can say that I am greatly impressed by it. The amount of detail that went in to the states of California and Nevada is unbelievable. Even though its running on the same engine as Euro Truck 2, it still feels like a new experience for me. It is definitley a step up from the bland cities of Euro Truck.\nThings I don't like:\n1. The lack of long roads. One thing I enjoyed about Euro Truck was being able to stay on one highway for a long time and just enjoy the journey on the road. On nearly every journey on ATS, there are a number of turns on to different highways, usually dont stay on one for over 5 minutes\n2. Only coming with two trucks. Yes, I know there are going to be a ton of new mods that are going to make up for it, but I was looking forward to driving more high quality trucks from SCS. I am looking forward to when they do put more in the game.\n3. The weigh stations. One of the biggest things I was looking forward to was learning how to do the weigh stations and what they would be like. Well, as of now, they don't do anything. The ones at the rest stops literally do not do anything, no icons or anything. They are just there. The ones on the highway will randomly ask you to pull in for a vehicle inspection. When you get there, you just stop on the icon and press enter and they will tell you to continue. You dont get to know the weight of your cargo or anything. I am hoping they will put more into them as the game continues its development.\n\nOverall I am still very excited to be playing ATS. I know the mods will make this game what we all wanted it to be.

Buses still go 25 under the highway speeds. Highway signs are on the wrong side of highway still. Cars are still floating in air. They are selling it as a new game but 3 years later it is the same no differnce but US. Is it a sim or car game. Now you can turn off traffic tickets wow. Maybe they should have hired someone that understand USA driving. Cop cars was a great thing in this game and turned it into a great sim but you can now turn it off. Maybe you should have just put reduce speed signs up like we have in USA but you do not understand why we got upset with that. You are selling a game to the US market and do not understand the US market. In US we like a full game and this is far from that.\n\nIf the game was about money you got it out, missed out on millions of $ and all you had to do is waiting a few more months. I would have added some other trucks and a 4 or 5 more states at first then sold it for 28.99 and paid for you're programers to build the rest of the game.  Someone should be fired for this one. It is the most unpolished game I seen in awhile. This is like calling a plumber in to fix you toilet and he does not test and flush it to see if it works and leaves you take a crap and man that stinks, just like the game does now.

I loved ATS, all of my hours on record I have from playing it on the first few days of release and I got 100% map in less than 20 hours and then it got boring and repetitve and I couldn't bring myself to play it anymore. Sure there are map extensions like c2c and other crap like that but that's not the quality I want from I game I payed 20 euros from, I don't want to have to rely on mods to keep this game fun for me, especially since those mods are one road that connects more cities which look pretty much the same. It was fun for first 10 hours to drive around sunny California and I have really enjoyed the content that's in there and this is where we get to why I do NOT recommend this game: It has amazing potential, it has beautiful graphics, it has fixed 99.9% of my issues with ETS2 (which we will get to in a second), the detail in it is amazing all the assets make the game look fantastic, but this game is made by a relativly small company and it doesn't have a lot of developers and all of them are working at the same time on ETS 2 and this game and maybe even coach sim, who knows? They're very, very, very slow and new content is taking bloody ages to come out and as I said previously it gets boring and unentertaining very quickly. So my advice when it comes to this game is:\n1) If you have ETS 2 and all the DLC; WAIT! Just wait until this game has more contenct and get some cheap bundle where you get all the states and this game will be gold if the developers put the same effort in as they did for the base game\n2) If you have ETS 2 and no DLC; You're better of buying the DLC for ETS 2 (excluding the paint DLC because that is pointless ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥) and you will get far more many hours of entertainment from Scandinavia and go east then you will from this game.\nAnd finally, if you don't have ETS nor ATS;\nGet ETS2 and all the DLC as it has far more content and it will give you many more hours of enjoyment and many more hours of gameplay!\nAs time passes and ATS gets more content I will change this review, but untill then I can't recommend paying 20 euros for this game, not now, but as I say, this review might change!","May 4","false","18.0"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","1"

One of which is the new trailer parking options. I find it very pleasing to be able to choose how you would like to park the trailer.\n\nThe trucks themselves are quite different from the trucks in ETS. The trucks in this game have long bonnets, and I find it rather difficult to turn since I am used to the bonnet-less European trucks from ETS.\n\nMoving on to the map. The map in this game is still small compared to the map in ETS2. Currently, the game only has 2 states in its map.\n\nOverall, however, I think that this game is very enjoyable to play, and I find it relaxing to play this game, especially while listening to music.","February 4","true","7.3"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

I highly recommend ATS to anybody that likes driving Sim's.\nThat being said they did get some of the roads wrong.  The I5 between Bakersfield and LA, known as the Grapevine,\nshould have a 6% grade both north and south.  Also 58 east from Bakersfield to Tehachapi should be freeway and also has a 6% grade on it going east until you get to Tehachapi.  It's the sierra Nevada mountain range that is being traversed in both cases.  As California is not flat like some people think.

ATS acts the same as ETS2, but set in America, driving full on American Trucks!\n\nGameplay (Pros)Now, before the hate comments come in about ATS being the same as ETS2, but set in America. I do agree but alot more, relaxing and more interesting. Now, ATS has 2 states; California and Nevada, Not alot but there is so much to explore and MUCH more detail than pervious SCS games. The cities are more bigger and detailed than ETS2, the environment is stunning and more alive. Like I remember, doing a quick job in Las Vegas I looked over to my right and, there were kids playing at skate park!\n\nEnvironment (Pros)Okay, the scenary is beautiful! Driving through the Nevada desert in my owned Peterbilt, going around Cali is stunning. The amount of detail on this game is amazing. The roads look more rotten and dusty, seeing tumbleweed crossing the roads, birds or whatever they're roaming the skies. Okay, now the cities, what can I say about them? Let me say something; the cities are alot more detailed than ETS2. Like, seriously, then building look more rotten and dirty, there are alot more freedom in them. And more challenging parking areas to manouver your trailer, and with the nose at the front, you're going to hit alot of walls if you don't be careful enough!\nEddy's is by far the hardest place to park! Like, Seriously, try and park that trailer behind that wall without hitting anything!\n\nTrucks (Pros)Okay, there are only 2 trucks in the game, in whiched they're fully licensed trucks.\nThere are; Peterbilt and Kenworth. Both are good looking trucks and are good starting trucks. I can't tell you much about them, but they're "Worth" a try. ;)\n\nOkay, now on to Cons.\n\nGameplay(Con) The gameplay acts the same way as ETS2. Get a load, drive it to your destination, unload, BAM DONE! Not only that but, the map isn't that big at all. There are only 2 states in the game; California and Nevada, which isn't impressive, at all. The roads and scenary are a straight copy and paste of the Scandinavia DLC from ETS2. The cities are the same but, bigger and detailed, in fact, there are cities that only have ONE company in it! ONE!\n\nEnvironment (Con)As I said, the environment is a straight COPY AND PASTE of the Scandinavia DLC! Like, seriously, they never put any effort into a new game! Speaking of new game, this should of being a DLC for ETS2. The same game, but with a improved game engine, which is only polished and the same.\n\nTrucks (Con)On launch, I was hoping for more than 4 trucks but, there are only 2! Yea, you heard me, 2 trucks! The brands are; Peterbilt and Kenworth and they're boring, to keep on driving over, over and over again!\n\nAnyway, that is my review on ATS or American Truck Simulator.\nThis is my honest review on what I think ATS is! But any how, keep on trucking! ;)","February 8","true","108.8"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Then about a year ago I bought Euro Truck Sim 2.  Very quickly found that I enjoyed the realism in the driving experience and really appreciated the Dev Group's work on improving and adding more maps and trucks to the game.  So when American Truck Simulator was announced I didn't hesitate.  SCS has not let me down at all with this newest version of their work.  Many people will complain about lack of truck choices and map size at the moment.  Please put it into perspective,  It takes time to get licenses to show the actual different makes of trucks in this game.  Most companies want their equipment painted in the best possible light so SCS has to make sure to do their best work on every truck, not just looks but function and capabilities.  As for the map some are saying that the highway driving doesn't seem long enough but please realize when the full USA is complete it will take an estimated 1 hr or more of real time to go coast to coast.  This is because of the sheer size of our country.  At this point I have zero complaints with the game and am just patiently waiting for the new updates that will come.\n\nI do have some things I would like to see in the American version of this game but will post it to Dev's.\n\nP.S.

The menus may be the same, but the trucks are big, brash, and tower over all of the other cars unlike in ETS2. The trailers are much longer, giving it a new challenge that I didn't face in ETS2. The map may be small, but there are many intricate details that make it fun to drive on with every delivery.

The amount of content is minimal at best. I've played just under 2 hours and have managed to visit and explore the majority of California and yet I still have no money. Which brings me onto my next point, ALL of the fine's are too hard to compete with early game. It's like it expects you to be amazing straight off the bat. Trucks and cars seem to stop at junctions and give way for so long that the traffic backs up in both directions and you have to drive into the wrong lane and do a big loop around it all, which I get fined for as I slightly graze the car behind me backing up to make room to pull out. The spped fines seem random. Sometimes im doing 80 in a 60 zone and nothing happens but go forbid I go 38 in a 35. I'm finding it nearly imposinble to make any sort of profit and and finding the $900 odd profit from the beginning jobs very uncompelling. I'm going to recommend waiting to get this game until theres more content, more then 2 trucks (yes theres only 2 trucks in the game), and until they release a patch to fix the traffic. I saw 2 trucks stop on opposite sides of the road having a starring contest under a freeway brige for no reason which meant both sides got blocked and nobody could pull into or out of the freeway","February 3","false","43.3"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

We dont expect a usable inteface , just a skin change in the cab and maybe an option to change it at truck dealers or shops..\n\nRailroad crossings in the US are not set up like they are in the game to protect all lanes on all sides. if they were then there would not be car - train accidents...

Yes, there's only 3 trucks (with another on the way) and 2 states (with Arizona on the way), but I knew this well in advance. In fact, the game was originally just going to be California.\n\nLike Euro Truck Simulator 2, this game is relaxing way to pass the time, see the country, and learn about it, albeit on a scaled down version. This game does a bit more than ETS 2 by recreating some locations and buildings. The cities are bigger, and some towns are so small they barely exist outside a gas station/rest area and a job site. Not every city has a garage and employment agency, so it won't be as easy to make money. Still plenty of truck customization options. Each truck has its own set of unique paintjobs too. Trailers can get longer, and on top of the longer cabs, you will have to figure out manuvering around corners. There's also multiple options for parking (and you can set it to always easy or hard in the Options). Police cars now roam the streets, so speed limits will be more enforced, and they're not as bad as they were in the beginning. Mod support has been immediate (and signs of going to Steam Workshop too).\n\nI'm going to keep on trucking, building up my company, leveling up to upgrade my truck, and waiting for new states to unlock and trucks to buy so I can go from sea to shining sea.","February 16","true","145.3"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

However, the quality of what is there is significantly better than much of even ETS2's Scandinavia DLC and MUCH butter than vanilla ETS2. Cities while still only about a mile wide but feel larger and drop off points to each city can stray quite far away from the city centre. Overall the balance of freeway to urban driving feels way better, though obviously still weighted to freeway travel as expected. Drop off and pick up points also have much more detail and the optional easy and hard parks go a long way to keeping the game interesting. Many hard parks involve reversing on your blind side or wedging your now much longer truck inside the tiniest gaps possible.\n\nDespite only two states there is a good variance in terrain and the shifts between biomes feel slow and natural despite the small map size. Major freeways oft look plain as always but the smaller B-roads (or whatever they call them in 'murika) are fantastic to roll along, often windy with a lot of elevation changes and great scenery. Urban driving is also more prevalent now and rife with details to soak in while sitting at the red lights for ages.\n\nOn the bad side, traffic AI is almost unchanged from ETS2; meaning it is dumb as bricks. Freeways are also rather poorly designed there are very few merging lanes and most of the time it's just a simple yield sign. Perhaps this is true to life for American roads but paired with the idiot AI it can be a bit jarring. There are also more than a few junctions where a town connects directly to a major freeway at a 90 degree angle and in these scenarios the AI just can't cope at all meaning you can be stuck there permanently unless you quicksave/load to remove the traffic.\n\nA big selling point is future potential in DLC both free and paid, SCS have mentioned[blog.scssoft.com] they want players to be able to drive from one coast to the other and even past both of America's borders  though this will understandably require paying extra for the privilege. In addition there should be many more free trucks once licensing issues are taken care of. ETS2 also had a huge mod library and there is little reason to think ATS won't get the same treatment. This however will all take time with Arizona, the first extra state from SCS being still 3 months away.\n\nThere isn't much here and I've no doubt people will easily run out of things to do before DLC arrives but the game is also pretty damn cheap for what you are getting.","February 4","true","26.2"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

This game is such a disapointment i was hoping to have a realistic game to play, not only are the hit boxes to big but the speed limits arent even right (at least in vegas) nor are the laws and you get speeding tickets far far far to fast even if you're doing what the A.I is doing Euro Truck is far better then this game i could play that all day but this game? it pisses me off with all the wrongs done not only that its only Cali and Nevada i was expectiong to have at least half the US to go between that last 5 jobs i've done have been the same job with different cargo sorry but until you guys fix things i dont recommend this game, oh and the trucks really? only two companies!?!?! with very few differences between them even if this game is "cheap" only like $20 but i dont even think its worth that much.

There are so many new things to see and do in the game, and the new parking choices are really nice to have.\n\n3) I'm absolutely delighted with the game as it is, and i cannot wait until I see more from SCS for American Truck Simulator.\n\nSeriously recommend it if you loved ETS2 - it's the same game, in America, with better detail and better options.\n\n11/10 - can't wait for more to come!","February 4","true","36.5"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

It's a game that shouldn't be enjoyable to anyone except a 'niche' of simulator fans, but somehow it's just...captivating. Maybe I get too into it, but there isn't anything quite as relaxing as just driving down the highway listening to internet radio (via a feature in the game that allows you to) and just watching America roll by. Right now, it's just California and Nevada, which makes the game world feel a bit smaller and less varied than it's predecessor, Euro Truck Simulator 2.

However, the quality of what is there is significantly better than much of even ETS2's Scandinavia DLC and MUCH butter than vanilla ETS2. Cities while still only about a mile wide but feel larger and drop off points to each city can stray quite far away from the city centre. Overall the balance of freeway to urban driving feels way better, though obviously still weighted to freeway travel as expected. Drop off and pick up points also have much more detail and the optional easy and hard parks go a long way to keeping the game interesting. Many hard parks involve reversing on your blind side or wedging your now much longer truck inside the tiniest gaps possible.\n\nDespite only two states there is a good variance in terrain and the shifts between biomes feel slow and natural despite the small map size. Major freeways oft look plain as always but the smaller B-roads (or whatever they call them in 'murika) are fantastic to roll along, often windy with a lot of elevation changes and great scenery. Urban driving is also more prevalent now and rife with details to soak in while sitting at the red lights for ages.\n\nOn the bad side, traffic AI is almost unchanged from ETS2; meaning it is dumb as bricks. Freeways are also rather poorly designed there are very few merging lanes and most of the time it's just a simple yield sign. Perhaps this is true to life for American roads but paired with the idiot AI it can be a bit jarring. There are also more than a few junctions where a town connects directly to a major freeway at a 90 degree angle and in these scenarios the AI just can't cope at all meaning you can be stuck there permanently unless you quicksave/load to remove the traffic.\n\nA big selling point is future potential in DLC both free and paid, SCS have mentioned[blog.scssoft.com] they want players to be able to drive from one coast to the other and even past both of America's borders  though this will understandably require paying extra for the privilege. In addition there should be many more free trucks once licensing issues are taken care of. ETS2 also had a huge mod library and there is little reason to think ATS won't get the same treatment. This however will all take time with Arizona, the first extra state from SCS being still 3 months away.\n\nThere isn't much here and I've no doubt people will easily run out of things to do before DLC arrives but the game is also pretty damn cheap for what you are getting.","February 4","true","26.2"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

The amount of content is minimal at best. I've played just under 2 hours and have managed to visit and explore the majority of California and yet I still have no money. Which brings me onto my next point, ALL of the fine's are too hard to compete with early game. It's like it expects you to be amazing straight off the bat. Trucks and cars seem to stop at junctions and give way for so long that the traffic backs up in both directions and you have to drive into the wrong lane and do a big loop around it all, which I get fined for as I slightly graze the car behind me backing up to make room to pull out. The spped fines seem random. Sometimes im doing 80 in a 60 zone and nothing happens but go forbid I go 38 in a 35. I'm finding it nearly imposinble to make any sort of profit and and finding the $900 odd profit from the beginning jobs very uncompelling. I'm going to recommend waiting to get this game until theres more content, more then 2 trucks (yes theres only 2 trucks in the game), and until they release a patch to fix the traffic. I saw 2 trucks stop on opposite sides of the road having a starring contest under a freeway brige for no reason which meant both sides got blocked and nobody could pull into or out of the freeway","February 3","false","43.3"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

And as a result, I would recommend that title over this one. A lot of people are complaining about the lack of content, but I don't have any issues with the amount of area, only that it is utterly uninteresting terrain. Furthermore, the game is increditably punishing to new drivers. The first trucks that you drive are so underpowered that they can barely move, and when you do finally get up to speed, you are given a speeding ticket --that costs you more than you'll make from the job- if you happen to go ~2 mph over the speed limit. Then there is the AI that seems to actively try to cause traffic accidents with you --costing you yet more money. There are a few aspects of this game that I like, but ultimately it is too frustrating to spend any real time on.","February 5","false","38.3"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

On top of that the game feels like a reskinned ETS with different music, I get that its easier to make the new game like that, but I feel this game came out with about 4% of what it should have and that im going to have to pay more on DLC's to get the rest of the 96, and if thats the case, then shame on the developers.

Say the speed limit is 55, and other traffic is going 70 including the cop, you'll get a ticket which makes no sense. They need to fix that.\n\nThe GPS: It seems to be weirding out all of the sudden making it mark roads on the other side of the road. For instance, if you go on an off ramp, it will show it on the other side of the road as well to go on the other side of the road to get onto this ramp. Need to fix your GPS.\n\nCars running into you: I've had this happen MANY times now when I am at a red light and a car will hit my truck causing me to have to pay for it. I've had cars come off of an on ramp and run right into my truck causing me to, again, pay for the fine. I've had cars in the passing lane run right into my truck for no apparent reason causing me to pay the fine. This starts ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off when you're trying to earn money and you're now racking up a repair bill.\n\nCustomization of your truck: This game needs a bit more when it comes to customizing your ride. All though, this isn't a major issue or anything, this is something that would be just nice to have.\n\nGraphics: I run this game on full settings but the graphics seem a bit grainy for me. All though it isn't bad at all, it's just something they need to work on.\n\nControls: I run this game with a keyboard, always have. The turning is great in this game. The braking is a bit weird from Euro Truck. But, all in all, it's great.\n\nJob: Considering this game is still in development I have not much to say other than it needs more to do in the game. So, still waiting for major updates as the map is extremely small compared to Euro Truck.\n\nThe game engine: It seems they haven't done much improvements as far as the games engine goes for graphical settings. It seems to use the Euro Truck engine.\n\nI'll rewrite this review when they start adding more to the game so I can give a proper review. All in all, it is worth the money to me. Great game.\n\nMy system specs:\nProcessor: AMD 6300 FX (3.5 GHz 6 core)\nRAM: 8 GB DDR3 Corsair Vengeance\nVideo: eVGA 750 Ti 2 GB FTW\n\nGame runs at a crisp 60 FPS with a few minor drops to 58 here and there.","March 29","true","13.3"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

This 'game' is suitable only it seems, for budding Eddie Stobart drivers preparing for their first week on the job. Beyond the -repeat- tedium of overzealous police, speed limits that make me want to increase the rate time passes to actually get anywhere, and the god damn lack of any ounce of imagination when it comes to road design (seriously the most inspiring road design appears to be a series of miniature hills near Bakersfield), we see a return of invisible walls to the world of gaming, I thought had been left behind in 2006.\n\nI bought this for two reasons, I wanted to use an controller with my computer, and I wanted a nice relaxing game.

Whilst everyone complains about the slow development from SCS, I give them credit for having this game out so soon. I am shocked at the fanbase's reaction purely because they went betching off about how the Pete 389 or the Mack Superliner or some shet like that wasn't included in the base release. Upon first playing it I admit I was thoroughly impressed just by the way the game felt to me, It hasn't grown old to me yet actually.\nSo let's start simple enough for the children to read shall we?\nThe map: Wow, a whole other continent. What an effing shock, everyone!! It is, to my knowledge of 3d modeling, pretty damn good.\nThe scenery & props (buildings): Okay, this is where I personally believe SCS absolutely outdid themselves, I mean look at it, weigh scales, actual truckstops, random rest areas, all characteristics of... *drumroll* THE USA!!!!! Little motels out there occasionally in the countryside..\nThe graphics: Wow, these are just perfection over my old ETS2 graphics, not to mention it runs better hahaha\n\nHonestly, 20/10, I'd drive a Peterbilt 579 for 200000 miles again any day.","March 30","true","131.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PyroTyger/recommended/270880/","PyroTyger","PyroTyger","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PyroTyger/","458 products in account","TLDR: If you think you might like it, you probably will. If you don't see the point, don't expect it to surprise you. There are problems, but I expect them to improve with DLC and patching.\n\nI'm not much into hard-sim games, but for some reason this one appealed. I couldn't even explain why.\n\nThis game doubles up as a hardcore truck-driving simulator, and a casual time-sink.\n\nIf you want to get a steering-wheel controller, manual shifter input and analogue pedals, play the whole game from the driver's camera perspective and grind out your hours as a big-rig stalwart, it's well set up for that. Slowly build your business, earn the right to take high-value cargo for long distance hauls, plan your fuel & rest stops, watch your speed and park your trailer perfectly every time for bonus XP.\n\nBut if you just want to use your WASD & mouse, pick up a Quick Job and drive from point-to-point for ten minutes, bashing through the occasional stop-start idiot who clogs up the junction, ditching the trailer at the gate and logging off again... well, that's totally fine too. It's a sim. You can be as serious or casual as you like.\n\nBoth are fun, in different ways, and the game does well at supporting both styles of play.\n\nPOSITIVE\nI have one thing to say here, but it's a big one: this game is, on occasion, breathtakingly beatufiul. I have had moments when a sunrise vista has opened up before me, after a gruelling 15hr (well, 15m) night drive through a featureless desert, pushing the speed limit to try and hit my destination before blacking out from exhaustion, and the moment has given me *real feels!* Like, a wistful wanderlust, or a warm familiar feeling. In some small way, I felt what it was like to be a long-haul trucker.\nThis can only be achieved by a number of things coming together. Distinct and recognisable landscapes; above-par atmospheric lighting & graphics, sufficient technical challenge to keep you focussed and slightly stressed for long periods of time, and a solid enough engine to make it all feel immersive. I was genuinely startled when some tumbleweeds blazed across the road in my headlights one night.\nThat's only one positive, but it can't be overstated.\n\nNEGATIVE\nThere are bugs. It's a sim, so there are always limitations on realism, but the AI of police and other road users is occasionally crushingly stupid or arbitrary.\nThere is also a limit on the game's size - two states (at launch) greatly scaled-down only gives you a few hours' driving before you've seen it all. The details are pretty good and I'm sure it'll be improved by DLC in future, but for now it's a big limitation.\nSometimes, very rarely, using a Steam Controller, the control scheme will just break, and you'll go careening into a barrier at 55mph for no reason. Such immersion-breaking is criminal for a sim, and I hope Steam and/or the developers get on that ASAP. Today my controller suddenly started providing massive haptic feedback, contrary to my settings, so... yeah. New game, new technology. Fingers crossed.\nThe biggest problem, though, is the strategic side of things. Upgrading your truck (beyond a bigger engine & improved gearbox) is very costly but basically pointless. It's a cosmetic change to something you pretty much never see. But then the only other thing you can spend your hard-earned cash on is growing the business, which... just brings in more money. I don't know what else you could expect from a truck sim, but it seems like a one-dimensional management game has been tacked on the side with little purpose.\n\nOnce I realised the larger game offered little more than the (casual) Quick Job mode, the game lost a lot of its appeal. It was a cathartic ride up to that point, though, so I'll probably still dip in occasionally, and I'm happy to recommend it for the money. If the challenge of technical driving appeals to you, this is worth a look.","February 23","true","36.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

But it got boring, quick. I understand you would do the quality over quantity thing but this is ridiculous. 2 states and 2+1 trucks, the w900 long haul cab making it impossible to park a 53 because it being the biggest truck SCS ever made. The other two are literally the same when it comes to looks and customization options. Why the hell is there only two trucks in a game where the theme is american, and the game ships with the modern trucks instead of the w900? And there isnt a frieghtliner cascadia or volvo vnl in sight, the two most popular trucks registered in america. What a joke. The states have the same assets in every corner, and the time scaling is so ridiculous. It's a simulator ffs, why would you try to ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t the time scale... I don't know why SCS software didn't develop a new engine instead of using the same engine from ets2 that has known bugs liked messed up anti-ailiasing and huge limitations on physics. Then people would love this game, but no lets use the same engine and sink 4 more years on the same tired engine that is from German Truck Simulator (thats right, the same game engine) instead of developing something new.\n\nThis game is a waste of money, do not buy!  Get Euro Truck Simulator 2 with the DLC bundle, you'll get much more driving pleasure out of it, plus there is tons and tons of mods there in case you get bored of the plethora of trucks and kilometers of roads that come with the base game.

Sure, the scale is sort of small, and yes there isn't nearly as many roads as ETS2, but the cities and enviroment, and just level of detail make up for it.\n\nDon't get me wrong, American Truck Simulator is the same game as Euro Truck Simulator 2. It's a different map, different trucks, but the game is the same. However, in saying that, I feel American Truck Simulator is funner to play personally, and I haven't touched ETS2 since.\n\nYou actually feel as if you ware driving through actual cities. The enviroments, I've driven down the same road 10 times, and still notice something new. American Trucks, in my opinion, are much funner to drive. While the map does skip some accuracy, it still feel similar. Driving through California feels like driving through California. I am a really happy camper, and plan on purchasing upcoming Map DLC to support these devs.\n\nFOR YOU LINUX USERS:\nI fully converted to Linux full time (no dual boot) in September 2015, and I must say, the Linux Version is remarkable. I have a GTX 980 and use Nvidia Proprietary Drivers (keep that in mind) and the performance is on par with the Windows Version. I even use a Logitech G27. No issues whatsoever. I'd give the SCS team a high five for this. Remarkable.\n\nMy ONLY Complaint about this game, is still the lack of Force Feedback on Logitech G27 (and other wheels) under Linux. It's purely a Game Issue, as the Linux Beta for ETS2 had Force Feeback, then it was removed and never fixed. Force Feedback works flawlessly on every other game. If they would fix this, I would be so so grateful.","February 21","true","88.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

For the medium/hard way you get the most XP (40/90 XP-Points))\n4) The game world is filled with life to a higher degree, there are more peasants walking on the pedestrian walks, there are workers working on the delivery/reception sites, there are security men standing in front of supermarkets etc etc.\n5) There are more different delivery sites, instead of just delivering to company yards and building sited you can now also deliver to gas stations.\n6) The game is set in America (Cpt. Obvious strikes again).\n\nThe game is available for a fair price of 20€, for which you get the US-States of California, Nevada and Arizona (That's still in the pipeline).\nBut California and Nevada for themselves are alrdy highly detailed, there are about 10-15 cities in California and about 10 in Nevada, so, if you compare it with the Old 18 Wheels of Steel Games from SCS, where California had two cities, a huge increase!\nArizona is coming for free too, what States in which Quantity the other DLC's will deliver is subject to the future, I don't know that.\nI think, that SCS, as they alrdy did with ETS2 and its DLC's, will deliver a reasonable amount of DLC's for a fair price and with a fair content in it.\nAs I've read, relying on that this wasn't a joke, they plan to eventually map the whole of North- and Latin-America atleast down to the equator, but of cause this is a work for years to come.\n\nAll in all, this game, just like his older brother ETS 2, is a shining juwel in the simulation genre and I can recommend it from the bottom of my heart.\n\nUpdate #01: Another positive thing: Just days after release they alrdy added the third truck the legendary Kenworth W900, a truck the community asked for. Another reason to recommend the game, because of the consumerfriendly policy of SCS, thumbs up!","February 14","true","59.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","0"

Graphics, much better.  Game play experience is less than ETS2 overall.  Emergency breaking required on speed limit changes, a cop behind every wall.  Speed limit changes are near impossible to determine that are going to or have changed, you rely on your GPS to tell you these changes, which takes your eyes off the road constantly.  Onramps at the length of a suburban home driveway.  No real long hauls, just feels smaller than ETS2, not because of only the 2 states, but just the general feel of the length of roads.  Gives the feeling that SCS has focused on graphics rather than gameplay.  It's a simulator, and at this time, ETS2 is more aligned to simulation than the new ATS arcady gameplay feeling.","February 6","true","190.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

There have been a lot of discussions about how small the map is (both in coverage and in ratio), but I must say that I'd rather drive on so beautifully detailed roads (like the ones in this game) for 30 minutes than driving on very long roads with almost no detail on them for 1 hour. The rest of the game is almost identical to ETS2, but I'm not really bothered by that.\n\nHaving said that, I cannot wait for Arizona (next free DLC),  New Mexico, Texas, Oregon and Washington(under developement), for new american roads to explore! Yes, some DLCs may cost money but the map you get at the start (California, Nevada and Arizona) with around 40 cities is really worth 20€.\n\n\nPROS Beautiful map, with a very nice vibe of California and the wilderness of Nevada's long straight desert roads.\nGraphics have been slightly improved compared to ETS2.\nCities do feel like cities, they're not just a texture on the background.\nMERICA!\nCONS Your AI workers are still just a simulation running in background.\nOnly 3 truck models as of now (more will be added in the future, as free DLC I hope)\nNo route 66 yet.","February 18","true","44.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The up coming Arizona dlc is not going to change the orentation of the game enough to be worthwhile.

This is a big downgrade from Euro Truck Simulator 2, which spanned from the UK to Poland. However, in my opinion, the environment you're driving in in ATS is far more interesting than in ETS2. Where ETS only had vague hints of there being a city somewhere in the distance, having you drive through bland industrial areas which were virtually indistinguishable from one another, in ATS you actually get to drive through the actual cities, which have a lot of detail put into them, and all look very different. The roads outside the cities also put you in more interesting situations sometimes, and the roads differ from each other a lot, where in ETS they were pretty much all the exact same.\n\nThe game only has 2 trucks right now, with another coming very soon. This, to me, is not much of a problem, as even in ETS I only ever used 1 or 2 trucks. The amount of trucks in ETS was actually a little overwhelming to me the first time, as I had no knowledge of trucks and didn't know where to start, so there only being 2 trucks actually was a little more welcoming to me this time around.\n\nStill, with that in mind, I have a hard time recommending this game over ETS2. If you haven't played ETS2 yet, get that game first. It's got a lot more to offer and a lot more to keep you going. However, if you have already played ETS2, have all the DLC and want more, then I'd recommend this to you. It's a lot more atmospheric and has got enough content to keep me going.","February 11","true","23.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It's very similar to ETS however they have improved upon the game engine, graphics and the road layouts. Thankfully now junctions make sense and dont suddenly turn into a slip road forcing you to cut up traffic as you change lane at the last minute.\n\nCurrently at launch there are only two counties you can drive in (Nevada and California) and from what i've read another county or two will be free to those who have already bought the game but after that it further counties will be charged DLC. I believe they have a similar business model as that of Train Simulator where the base game is fairly cheap but add-on DLC will be the same price as the base game, if not more. I don't mind paying for DLC for a quality game like this where i will invest a lot of time into it, but please don't be money hungry b******* like EA or Activision.\n\nIf you enjoyed Euro Truck Sim, or any driving simulation games then this is a must buy. The Multiplayer mod works great and the MP community (at time of writing this review) is quite reasonable and friendly. Just waiting for the 12 year olds to buy this and race around America....

Here are my two cents on the matter:\n\nGood Stuffs\nThe game is stunningly beautiful; the streets, buildings, and cars are all a lot more detailed compared to ETS2. This is always a pro in simulator games.\nThere are now parking difficulty levels.\nBad Stuffs\nThe map is too compressed and it makes quite a few on-ramps a nightmare. There are times where you cannot make the turn onto the onramp due to how sharp of a turn it is and/or you cannot hope to accelerate up to traffic on the on-ramp as they are far too short.\nThe AI is horrible as well as too often cars come barreling behind me to wind up rear ending me despite going at the speed limit. Every time this occurs, you get slapped with a $900 accident fee.\nThere are too many spots due to the compression of the map that have irregular speeds. For instance, on a highway that has a speed limit of 80, there will be times where the speed limit drops down to 45 for a brief moment.\nIn game speed limits do not match their visual counterparts.\nCars have a tendency to jump out at red lights when making a right hand turn and obstruct your way. I know the game is mimicking traffic laws in the United States by having legal right hand turns at stop lights, but this is just annoying.\nThere are no stoplight turn signals. In result, it’s very easy to get stuck in traffic when needing to make a left hand turn.\nETS2 had 7 different truck dealers. ATS has only 2 currently.\nI know the United States is a bit larger than the EU and therefor more difficult to create it but this game is severely disappointing by only having California and Nevada to work with in a game called American Truck Simulator.\nFinal Thoughts\nBetween the speeding violations caused by the previously mentioned and the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s that rear end you and drive up your monetary loss per job, this game is highly frustrating. I am surprised that SCS Software released this game and I can only hope that they continue to update it.","February 12","false","27.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I like that it's better optimised for low end computer (or extra low end computer, like mine) and the roads are wider, really useful in this game because the trucks and trailers are bigger than in ETS2. I like that cops starts "chasing" you when you are overspeeding, but, at first, it was frustating because i keep getting speed tickets and i do not know where from because i have seen not a speed both.\nTo sum up my experience so far, the money were well spend (it was a gift from a friend of mine, so his money, hahaha) and i like it.

There have been a lot of discussions about how small the map is (both in coverage and in ratio), but I must say that I'd rather drive on so beautifully detailed roads (like the ones in this game) for 30 minutes than driving on very long roads with almost no detail on them for 1 hour. The rest of the game is almost identical to ETS2, but I'm not really bothered by that.\n\nHaving said that, I cannot wait for Arizona (next free DLC),  New Mexico, Texas, Oregon and Washington(under developement), for new american roads to explore! Yes, some DLCs may cost money but the map you get at the start (California, Nevada and Arizona) with around 40 cities is really worth 20€.\n\n\nPROS Beautiful map, with a very nice vibe of California and the wilderness of Nevada's long straight desert roads.\nGraphics have been slightly improved compared to ETS2.\nCities do feel like cities, they're not just a texture on the background.\nMERICA!\nCONS Your AI workers are still just a simulation running in background.\nOnly 3 truck models as of now (more will be added in the future, as free DLC I hope)\nNo route 66 yet.","February 18","true","44.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

My biggest issue is that I don't understand where they are going with the dlc's. The orentation of the game at this point is north to south while the orentation of the highway system is east to west. The up coming Arizona dlc is not going to change the orentation of the game enough to be worthwhile.

This is a big downgrade from Euro Truck Simulator 2, which spanned from the UK to Poland. However, in my opinion, the environment you're driving in in ATS is far more interesting than in ETS2. Where ETS only had vague hints of there being a city somewhere in the distance, having you drive through bland industrial areas which were virtually indistinguishable from one another, in ATS you actually get to drive through the actual cities, which have a lot of detail put into them, and all look very different. The roads outside the cities also put you in more interesting situations sometimes, and the roads differ from each other a lot, where in ETS they were pretty much all the exact same.\n\nThe game only has 2 trucks right now, with another coming very soon. This, to me, is not much of a problem, as even in ETS I only ever used 1 or 2 trucks. The amount of trucks in ETS was actually a little overwhelming to me the first time, as I had no knowledge of trucks and didn't know where to start, so there only being 2 trucks actually was a little more welcoming to me this time around.\n\nStill, with that in mind, I have a hard time recommending this game over ETS2. If you haven't played ETS2 yet, get that game first. It's got a lot more to offer and a lot more to keep you going. However, if you have already played ETS2, have all the DLC and want more, then I'd recommend this to you. It's a lot more atmospheric and has got enough content to keep me going.","February 11","true","23.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I purchased this game on release date and have loved it and do not regret the purchase.\nEven though many people are saying it looks like ETS2, this was intended so that people will be able to play both games without having to learn completely different things, it's a great approach by SCS, something should be adopted by other game developers.\nHowever with things coming across from ETS2, it also brings the idiotic AI where cars constantly crash into you, but as far as I'm aware, SCS have plans to work on this.\nEven though there are only two states, you can't really complain considering the immense amount of detail that has gone into it, the detail blows ETS2 out of the waters.\n\nWould thoroughly recommend to anyone.\n10/10","February 29","true","31.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Even for California and L.A.  One after another after another passes by as if OJ was on the loose. In the real world, in California, there are too many freakin' cop cars but not as many as depicted in ATS, not one after another, after another, with another sitting on the side of the road. It makes me paranoid.\n(2) - The traffic patterns prevent "safe" turning from a side road onto a main highway without a traffic light or other method of controlling main highway traffic. It is not fun to sit for an hour in game time waiting for a lull in the traffic in order to make a left turn onto the highway. One has to resort to "bullying" the oncoming traffic which is not a habit one would want to get into. While this may "suggest" the real world traffic of Cali and L.A., in the game world it is frustrating and not fun. Especially when you have four lanes of heavy traffic going in opposite directions and you are sitting at a stop sign with a heavy load. Fix it!\n(3) - The highway travel time scale is too short. I don't get the feeling that I've made a "trip" from L.A. to Las Vegas. By the time I get comfortable on the Freeway, find a radio station with some good tunes on it, I'm already there. Travel time is too short. I hope this can be fixed in the release game or in the mods to come.\n\nI am still recommending this game for the west coast USA highway scenery.\nAt this time I am giving it 3 out of 5 stars.","February 4","true","19.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Yes, it is the full Euro Truck sim skin but the setting is so much more appealing. In Euro Truck (modless of course) Manchester is no different to Stockholm. It gets a little bit samey after a while, but the little diners, donut stands, sweeping desert vistas and iconic cities give this game a much more pleasing long haul in the truck even though there are only two states in the game currently.\n\nAs for the trucks, there maybe only two brands at the moment but they both drive so much more satisfyingly than the Euro truck rosta. You have to take on board my comments as a casual gamer, hardcore virutal truckers will probably find this easy compared to the Euro Truck routes because I wouldnt say it's dumbed down at all, I just find the truck handling so much more responsive. I managed to completed five jobs without a traffic violation, speeding ticket or an AI Kamikaze pilot veering into my side. That's a massive bonus and I'd say generally the AI is much better from inital impressions.\n\nGotta go now, I've got George Jones on the Internet Radio, my coffee in a travel mug, my Philadelphia Eagles Cap on and my best checked shirt pressed...got some miles to cover to get my own truck and I'm wasting time jabbering on here.

Sure, the scale is sort of small, and yes there isn't nearly as many roads as ETS2, but the cities and enviroment, and just level of detail make up for it.\n\nDon't get me wrong, American Truck Simulator is the same game as Euro Truck Simulator 2. It's a different map, different trucks, but the game is the same. However, in saying that, I feel American Truck Simulator is funner to play personally, and I haven't touched ETS2 since.\n\nYou actually feel as if you ware driving through actual cities. The enviroments, I've driven down the same road 10 times, and still notice something new. American Trucks, in my opinion, are much funner to drive. While the map does skip some accuracy, it still feel similar. Driving through California feels like driving through California. I am a really happy camper, and plan on purchasing upcoming Map DLC to support these devs.\n\nFOR YOU LINUX USERS:\nI fully converted to Linux full time (no dual boot) in September 2015, and I must say, the Linux Version is remarkable. I have a GTX 980 and use Nvidia Proprietary Drivers (keep that in mind) and the performance is on par with the Windows Version. I even use a Logitech G27. No issues whatsoever. I'd give the SCS team a high five for this. Remarkable.\n\nMy ONLY Complaint about this game, is still the lack of Force Feedback on Logitech G27 (and other wheels) under Linux. It's purely a Game Issue, as the Linux Beta for ETS2 had Force Feeback, then it was removed and never fixed. Force Feedback works flawlessly on every other game. If they would fix this, I would be so so grateful.","February 21","true","88.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PyroTyger/recommended/270880/","PyroTyger","PyroTyger","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PyroTyger/","458 products in account","TLDR: If you think you might like it, you probably will. If you don't see the point, don't expect it to surprise you. There are problems, but I expect them to improve with DLC and patching.\n\nI'm not much into hard-sim games, but for some reason this one appealed. I couldn't even explain why.\n\nThis game doubles up as a hardcore truck-driving simulator, and a casual time-sink.\n\nIf you want to get a steering-wheel controller, manual shifter input and analogue pedals, play the whole game from the driver's camera perspective and grind out your hours as a big-rig stalwart, it's well set up for that. Slowly build your business, earn the right to take high-value cargo for long distance hauls, plan your fuel & rest stops, watch your speed and park your trailer perfectly every time for bonus XP.\n\nBut if you just want to use your WASD & mouse, pick up a Quick Job and drive from point-to-point for ten minutes, bashing through the occasional stop-start idiot who clogs up the junction, ditching the trailer at the gate and logging off again... well, that's totally fine too. It's a sim. You can be as serious or casual as you like.\n\nBoth are fun, in different ways, and the game does well at supporting both styles of play.\n\nPOSITIVE\nI have one thing to say here, but it's a big one: this game is, on occasion, breathtakingly beatufiul. I have had moments when a sunrise vista has opened up before me, after a gruelling 15hr (well, 15m) night drive through a featureless desert, pushing the speed limit to try and hit my destination before blacking out from exhaustion, and the moment has given me *real feels!* Like, a wistful wanderlust, or a warm familiar feeling. In some small way, I felt what it was like to be a long-haul trucker.\nThis can only be achieved by a number of things coming together. Distinct and recognisable landscapes; above-par atmospheric lighting & graphics, sufficient technical challenge to keep you focussed and slightly stressed for long periods of time, and a solid enough engine to make it all feel immersive. I was genuinely startled when some tumbleweeds blazed across the road in my headlights one night.\nThat's only one positive, but it can't be overstated.\n\nNEGATIVE\nThere are bugs. It's a sim, so there are always limitations on realism, but the AI of police and other road users is occasionally crushingly stupid or arbitrary.\nThere is also a limit on the game's size - two states (at launch) greatly scaled-down only gives you a few hours' driving before you've seen it all. The details are pretty good and I'm sure it'll be improved by DLC in future, but for now it's a big limitation.\nSometimes, very rarely, using a Steam Controller, the control scheme will just break, and you'll go careening into a barrier at 55mph for no reason. Such immersion-breaking is criminal for a sim, and I hope Steam and/or the developers get on that ASAP. Today my controller suddenly started providing massive haptic feedback, contrary to my settings, so... yeah. New game, new technology. Fingers crossed.\nThe biggest problem, though, is the strategic side of things. Upgrading your truck (beyond a bigger engine & improved gearbox) is very costly but basically pointless. It's a cosmetic change to something you pretty much never see. But then the only other thing you can spend your hard-earned cash on is growing the business, which... just brings in more money. I don't know what else you could expect from a truck sim, but it seems like a one-dimensional management game has been tacked on the side with little purpose.\n\nOnce I realised the larger game offered little more than the (casual) Quick Job mode, the game lost a lot of its appeal. It was a cathartic ride up to that point, though, so I'll probably still dip in occasionally, and I'm happy to recommend it for the money. If the challenge of technical driving appeals to you, this is worth a look.","February 23","true","36.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

But it got boring, quick. I understand you would do the quality over quantity thing but this is ridiculous. 2 states and 2+1 trucks, the w900 long haul cab making it impossible to park a 53 because it being the biggest truck SCS ever made. The other two are literally the same when it comes to looks and customization options. Why the hell is there only two trucks in a game where the theme is american, and the game ships with the modern trucks instead of the w900? And there isnt a frieghtliner cascadia or volvo vnl in sight, the two most popular trucks registered in america. What a joke. The states have the same assets in every corner, and the time scaling is so ridiculous. It's a simulator ffs, why would you try to ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t the time scale... I don't know why SCS software didn't develop a new engine instead of using the same engine from ets2 that has known bugs liked messed up anti-ailiasing and huge limitations on physics. Then people would love this game, but no lets use the same engine and sink 4 more years on the same tired engine that is from German Truck Simulator (thats right, the same game engine) instead of developing something new.\n\nThis game is a waste of money, do not buy!  Get Euro Truck Simulator 2 with the DLC bundle, you'll get much more driving pleasure out of it, plus there is tons and tons of mods there in case you get bored of the plethora of trucks and kilometers of roads that come with the base game. Would not recommend this blatant cash grab to my worst enemy.","March 19","false","78.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It's only 20 bucks. It's very relaxing. Specially at night if you wanna relax and watch a movie while you drive.\n\nThe pros are its relaxing, the graphics are nice, you can sink a lot of time in it. You can slowly build your own company and hire drivers, and buy and customize your trucks. It also has some nice details like headlights, and windshield wipers, plus you can get tickets for tons of stuff like speeding, or driving at night without your headlights etc. so it immerses you in the game.  You can see some cool sites in the game, whether it be the golden gate bridge, alcatraz, or santa cruz, or (tiny)los angeles. It has a lot of activity in it while you drive, as in like parachuters, helicopters, blimps, jets, crop dusters, 747's, so it feels like it's alive. They also keep adding free dlc so it makes it nice for only 20 and its very easy to play.\n\nThe negatives are, as of its current state, there's only Nevada, and California, so you can explore the whole map in a few hours. And the driver AI are dumber than anything. They'll drive right into and won't see you. And there's only 3 trucks atm. In comparison to Eurotrucker 2, you get about half the money and half the experience as you would in Eurotrucker 2. So it feels a lot slower to build your empire in comparison.","March 1","true","86.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Beats buying hundreds of dollars in fuel/ maintanence and thousands on plane tickets.\n\nAs a comparison, I have known SCS before they came out with Euro Truck Simulator. First Game I had from them was 18 WoS: Convoy. So lets break it down to the Pros and Cons.\n\nPros:\n- Great Graphics - SCS has learned though constant development, As well as defining ATS as a true sim, compared to its ancestor with repetitive graphics and a pastel cabin that many users couldn't bear to drive in first person.\n- True to Detail - Many of the original models from 18 WoS series has been scraped, They have literally rebuilt the game from the ground up. Most of the maps that you will see driving down though the states is much more authentic than what you see in their works 10 years ago. Although compressed, alot of major streets that are driven on have much more  resemblance to their real life counterparts.\n- Research and other differences - SCS has been working hard focusing more on quality over the years, and it shows in their latest release, None of the models have been looking flat or out of place... yet.\n- Challenging Parking Options- I remember that there used to be loads of space to park a trailer in older games, now everything takes up space. I used to turn my truck around 3 in game miles away from the destination, flooring it. If I was in a rush, I'd park the trailer sideways and continued off to the truck dealership. Now I'm cussing left and right trying to angle my trailer into the depot. Best challenge of the entire trip.\nCons:\n- Small starting map- WoS had mutiple versions released about a year in between, and it had full maps for you to drive on. Although noted for its buggy qualities on the Prism3D engine, it was 80% enjoyable at the time. As a long time fan, I would've expected for at least a majority of the map to be completed at the time of it's debute. After experiencing a good 30 minutes of driving along the west coast, I wasn't dissipointed for its lack of content. That being said, since the title is american truck simulator and that they already have started on good ol' USA, I'm thinking that other counrties such as canada and mexico will come out as a paid DLC. Although the maps are watered down from their lengthy counperparts, I can see why driving seems to be too short for some.\n- Limited Selection of Trucks- A common complaint for many fans here. With just two trucks to pick from, there isn't going to be much diversity in your fleet for now. Although this falls under the "not enough content" panel, owning a quality well known truck in your garage leaves a much more smug feeling than having a chinese knockoff of said truck.\n- Lack of a variety of traffic lights- Specifically for turning left at some intersections.\n\nOverall: this game is worth more than 20 bucks once its complete, but it will still be worth it compared to buying a rental car and shuttling yourself across america.","February 5","true","34.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It's just two trucks and two sates to start with, but Arizona and more trucks will be coming soon.\n\nI have Euro Truck Sim 2, but I generally prefer Trucks and Trailers, and Scania Truck Sim, as these two old sims concentrate on the challenge of manouevering and parking rather than the driving in between. - (don't get me wrong, I still enjoy ETS2 though).\n\nBut I couldn't resist buying this - and somehow it is better than ETS2. The graphics, and atmosphere of driving along American freeways, just seems to suit the game better.\n\nI know others have complained about the slightly smaller scale, but that might be another reason why I prefer it to ETS2. The drive is long enough to enjoy, but not too long to get boring. And with the whole of USA planned, there is still plenty of scope for long drives.\n\nIt's looking good, I just hope SCS are reasonable when they start selling the DLCs, I am prepared to pay but I will draw the line if I keep paying £15 for every 3 states.

Ever since we were told they began development. I knew exactly what I was going to get, so I'm basing my review on that.\n\n____\n\nWhen you first see the game, it looks exactly like Euro Truck Simulator 2. The only differences include it being in the United States, having vehicles driven in the United States, trailers that are used in the United States, and a couple states in the United States.\n\nAfter you get past the $20 price tag and actually get in the game, it's exactly as it seems. Just a reskin of ETS2. But what was to be expected? It's the same engine used to rebuild ETS2 for a different region. That's what we were told we were going to receive and that's what we got. I am not at all upset that we only get 2 states at release with Arizona coming a little later for free and 2 trucks. I knew I was getting that and I paid the price for that.\n\nThe developers wanted to go the correct route with the game and get licensing for the vehicles used so the lack of vehicles is okay. As time goes on, we'll get loads more. As far as states go, 3 might not seem like much. With the scale, it definitely seems lacking in content. But you have to remember. If they went to a more in-depth scale and added more content, then it'd take years for a single state to come out. I don't know about you, but I'd like to have 48 states before I turn 70 years old. :P\n\nAnd the game is called American Truck Simulator. American. The United States is only one of dozens upon dozens of countries in America. Canada and Mexico are 2 more countries in NORTH America. Meanwhile, there's still South America that has to be scaled in. By the time we get all of that(if we ever do, the plans could change), we'd have so much map, we wouldn't be able to explore it all in a reasonable amount of time. Sure, California and Nevada might not seem like much, but they are comparable to Great Britain and France in ETS2 when you talk about size. Now add the equivelent amount of states as there are countries in ETS2 and you have the United States completed. UK and France might not seem like much on ETS2, but when you travel from one to the other, and then all the way to Poland and then up to Sweden, you start to realize that even though the map is small now, it will be much bigger later on when we have more content to play.\n\nNot much of a regular review that you'd see on Steam, but these are my opinions on the game so far. It's a reskin of ETS2 and that's what we were told and what we paid for. No complaints here. Still a billion times better than most simulators out there.","February 3","true","171.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Although right now the map size is much smaller than ETS2. But for now driving across California had never felt so good. The map is decent and makes it feel akin to what driving in America would feel like. From the run down shops to the overabundant amount of self storage businesses. The sweet joy of make a trip is still there, but those long hauls aren't quite there yet since you can only travel between two states. Many of the mechanics mirror what was in ETS2, such as ranking and how the game is played. So players of ETS2 will feel right at home.\n\nI would recommend this if you particularly liked ETS2 a lot and just want a new scenery and are willing to wait for more states and trucks. This feels barebones in a way with content as there is only two states currently and not very many trucks. Down the line, or very soon we should be getting Arizona and more trucks.\n\nEven with the lack of content the game is still enjoyable to play and check out the new scenes.","February 4","true","10.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

At first glance most will and appear to have said it looks like a very well done expansion pack for ETS2. While in some ways i do agree, overall i do not.\n\nThis is another score for SCS. While there is not much going on overall (being that there is only 2 trucks and 2 states to drive in) there is something rather satisfying about driving a Kenworth or Peterbilt along North American Roads with precious cargo.\n\nThe game is rather small right now. But so far i have throughly enjoyed the 68 hours i have played it so far. I am down now to two cities left to deliver cargo to and about 65% of all roads driven on.\n\nOne thing that is a bit disappointing is the lack of overall accessories and slots to drop stuff onto on the two trucks available (Kenworth T680 and the Peterbilt 579). Both trucks are nice to drive however. Plus the fact that truck and truck accessory mods from ETS2 are for the most part compatible with a few easy def file changes. Which has resulted in numerous truck mods and accessories being made available.\n\nFor those that are familiar with ETS2 may find this game a little lacking. However it is still just as oddly engrossing as it's european cousin.\n\nATS has the potential to be totally awesome once all of the USA is finally added as well as DLC's to add Canadian destinations and Mexican destinations will make this the most expansive game in SCS's library (considering the fact that once all of Canada is added it will add the 3rd largest physical country in the world with some of the worlds most dangerous trucking roads in the world). As well, the possabilities that can come from adding in Mexico is staggering.\n\nGreat first release. i for one will be buying each and every DLC for this game.\n\nGood Job SCS.\n\nKeep on Truckin'","February 7","true","062.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Here are my two cents on the matter:\n\nGood Stuffs\nThe game is stunningly beautiful; the streets, buildings, and cars are all a lot more detailed compared to ETS2. This is always a pro in simulator games.\nThere are now parking difficulty levels.\nBad Stuffs\nThe map is too compressed and it makes quite a few on-ramps a nightmare. There are times where you cannot make the turn onto the onramp due to how sharp of a turn it is and/or you cannot hope to accelerate up to traffic on the on-ramp as they are far too short.\nThe AI is horrible as well as too often cars come barreling behind me to wind up rear ending me despite going at the speed limit. Every time this occurs, you get slapped with a $900 accident fee.\nThere are too many spots due to the compression of the map that have irregular speeds. For instance, on a highway that has a speed limit of 80, there will be times where the speed limit drops down to 45 for a brief moment.\nIn game speed limits do not match their visual counterparts.\nCars have a tendency to jump out at red lights when making a right hand turn and obstruct your way. I know the game is mimicking traffic laws in the United States by having legal right hand turns at stop lights, but this is just annoying.\nThere are no stoplight turn signals. In result, it’s very easy to get stuck in traffic when needing to make a left hand turn.\nETS2 had 7 different truck dealers. ATS has only 2 currently.\nI know the United States is a bit larger than the EU and therefor more difficult to create it but this game is severely disappointing by only having California and Nevada to work with in a game called American Truck Simulator.\nFinal Thoughts\nBetween the speeding violations caused by the previously mentioned and the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s that rear end you and drive up your monetary loss per job, this game is highly frustrating. I am surprised that SCS Software released this game and I can only hope that they continue to update it.","February 12","false","27.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

People might say this is bad because, well, nothing changed, but this allowes ETS 2 mods to be ported over to ATS really quickly. I already have 7 more trucks than what the base game offers.\n(+15) Free DLCs which add more stuff to the US (etc. Arizona DLC coming soon)\n(+5) Great graphics.\n(+10) No glitches like your average simulator.\n(+10) You can select parking (Skip, Easy parking, and hard parking)\n(+1) America.\n(+10) Police actually driving around instead of hidden speed cameras.\n(+5) Pedestrians.\n(+1) Same kind of music as ETS 2 but with some guitar\n(+10) Actual FM radios. When you move outside the station you're listening to, then it will automaticly switch to the frequency of whatever zone your in.\n(+5) Better weather variation.\n(+15) Cities are actually interesting.\n(+3) Little details such as tumbleweed rolling around.\n\nPro score: +100\n\nCons\n(-1) Same engine. Yeah, this is also bad but not that bad.\n(-5) AI is really dumb, I get fined when a car slams into the back of me.\n(-5) Only two trucks (For now.)\n(-5) Only two states (California and Nevada, for now.)\n(-5) Trips feel too short when the distance should feel longer.\n\nCon score: -21\n\nOverall score: 79; Good. This review is going to change definitly after more content is added.","February 8","true","8.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Perhaps it is for the very reason that it isn't a ' kill everything that moves.  If it doesn't move, put it in your gun and kill.' I guess the closest way to describe it would be a classic transport tycoon game where you just happen to spend most of your time in the first person view of your best employee.  You can ignore the company builder component completely.  Or after you have spent some time building up your company you can devote much of your time to it.  I think players that do both will get the most from this game.\n\nYes it's only 3 states and 2 trucks, but I feel at a $20 price point this is a great deal.  SCS has a solid reputation of adding to the base game for years after release, and not just paid DLC.  If you compare the base game of ETS2 now with when it was first released it is practically an entirely new game.  This game will grow for years and they will devote their time and energy into this game rather than quickly cash in and release a half ♥♥♥♥♥ sequel.","February 7","true","51.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

If you hated ETS2, you'll hate ATS.\n\nPlenty of reviews of ETS2 out there, and other ATS reviews.  Simply put, it's ETS2 with better graphics, a much more thoughtfully designed, textured, and laid out world than early ETS2 content.  So much extra stuff going on, people walking, skateboarders, planes flying around, tumble weeds for f's sake people!  ATS is great for what it is, but it's super exciting that this could lead to a lot of states being added, and I'll be there money in hand when each one releases.  $20 is a steal on this, don't wait for a sale, you won't be disappointed.","February 9","true","32.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

(Including A New Truck Model In A Few Days Time)\nThere Is Going To Be 1 More State But That Is Still In Progress At The Time Of This Review!\n\nPositive Stuff The Game Is A Massive Upgrade To EST2 And All Of SCS's Other Trucking Gaming imo. Some Of You May Disagree But This Is My Review So Y'all Have To Put Up With That.\nSome Of My Favorite New Features Of The Game are:\n• The Tumbleweed\n• Trains\n• More Traffic\n• More Realistic Trucking Experience\n\nThe Tumbleweed\nOn The Day The Game Came Out, I Was At School, But That Was Good. Only A Few Hours Before The Game Came Out, I Was Paid By The YouTuber I Worked For And I Just Had Enough, I Was So Happy. Anyway, I Bought The Game And Let It Download While I Was There, Expecting It To Be Done In A Few Hours (Like 2 Hours Or So) But It Took Like 6 Hours (Welcome To Straya, How May I Help You?) It Finished Just Before I Got Home From School So I Could Play It ASAP. While I Was Doing My 2nd Or 3rd Delivery, I Was Just Casually Driving Along And Then The Tumbleweed Flew Across The Road, I Flipped My Sh*t, I Got So Excited Over Nothing (10/10 Would Truck Again).\n\nThe Trains\nTrains Are By Far One Of My Favorite Thing In Life. The Train Features Are Good. Be Like Trains\n\nMore Traffic\nThe Traffic Is Good.\nSee Next Topic For More\n\nThe More Realistic Feel\nThe Traffic, Trains & Cop Cars Make This Game A lot Better Then What It Really Is (imo). I Just Love How The Game Realism Has Changed, Look At EST2 For Example, You Don't Have Cops, Trains And Lots Of Traffic, Does It? That's All I Have To Say\n\nNegative Stuff Now For The Negative Stuff, There Isn't Much But This Is What There Is:\n• The Fines\n• Traffic Lights\n• Rest Stop Gaps Not Big Enough\n\nThe Fines\nImo The Fines Are Just A Tad Over Priced, Example, Red Light Fine Is 1k, In Straya Its Not Even 100-200 Dollars. They Need To Be Lower.\n\nTraffic Lights\nThe Traffic Lights (From Green To Red) Change Time Is Too Fast, The Yellow Light Doesn't Even Give Me Time To Slow Down, Especially When Your Going 55.. Change The Yellow Light Speed Please SCS\n\nRest Stops And Stuff\nI Was Trucking Along On A Nice Day & I Noticed I Was Out Of Fuel Almost, So I Checked Me Map & There Was A Station Just Up The Road, So I Go There To Get Fuel And I Couldn't Get My Trailer In Through The Small Gap, That Took 1.5 Hours At The Most To Get My Trailer Out Leaving Me With A Fine For A Car Crash & Damage To The Truck..\n\nFinal Words The Game Itself Is Worth The 20USD, Its Cheaper Then EST2. The Game Has A Few Bad Things, But Not Enough To Make Me Stop Playing.\n\nSCS MAKE AUSTRALIA TRUCK SIMULATOR PLEASE!!!","February 9","true","38.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

(4 years over the road).\n\nI am in love with the game because for one i drive 18 wheelers so it is natural for me.\n\nyou get california and nevada at launch and it is decent so far. from the south of cali to the north of cali takes all of 5 minutes to drive (80+ mph outlaw trucking). you will love the open road and straight shot highways where you can see for miles because you feel free compaired to ETS 2.\n\nmy only issue/ request is that i hope that we can buy our own trailer like in 18 wos haulin. in real life experience not all companies you haul for has their own trailer and also some of us only like to haul certain commodities and dont want to take any and every load out there.\n\nHope yall enjoy it as much as i do and cant wait to see more states (Texas for sure)","February 10","true","156.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"
