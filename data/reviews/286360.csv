The priest-detective concept (fine, ex-priest) is a novel enough idea in games, one I last enjoyed with the Shiva's rabbi. And sure, concpiracies centering around the Vatican are a dime a dozen, but the Italian background of the devs shows in the way they manage to be at the same time respectful and irrereverant, making a commonplace story feel refreshing. The story starts slowly but does a nice job of drawing you in, ending (predictably) with a cliffhanger, but one that made me interested in the episodes to come.\n\nThe writing mainly benefits from having small moments of actual brilliance in characterization, creating unexpectedly endearing portraits of both the hero and many the people you meet, that very much drive the storytelling. And since this is supposed to be the prologue in a 4 part series, there is alot of lovingly crafted character introduction to be had and enjoyed. In fact I have the feeling that it was the memorable characters (and therefore their story) and some decent pacing that caused me to mostly forget there were puzzles there. That, and the fact that they were mostly easy and logical, and that important information was always pointed out to you, more or less inobtrusively.\n\nSome more general stuff: The backgrounds are nicely made, the animation a bit less so but not jarring. I enjoyed the music very much, though the voice acting can be hit and miss. I also had no bugs or technical problems, which I appreciated (since the first time I tried to play the DRM free version a while back I had serious issues - glad to see them fixed). And yes, the game is rather short, which personally doesn't bother me for the price.\n\nAll in all, I was surprised by this one, and will look forward to the next act. It isn't perfect or particularly unique, but it is memorable and endearing, and I very much had fun with it while it lasted.","January 5, 2015","true","2.3"," 34 of 39 people (87%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","87","34","39","3","0"

Indications are the series was canned after the Italian release of Act 2, meaning that for most of the potential audience this is little more than a taster for a story that will never be completed.  That in itself may be enough reason to consider not buying it.  Speaking for myself -- I'm a massive adventure game fan.  Even with knowing that the series would not be going anywhere, I still bought the game and completed it.  (Honestly, because I feel like I need to play everything in the genre ...)\n\nThe controls are fairly standard -- right click to look, left click to interact and/or walk to a point on the screen.\n\nGraphics are mediocre;  the jerky, stiff animations are especially jarring.  There are comic book panels which probably looked good originally, but they were scanned at such a low resolution that they ended up fuzzy and requiring of a fair bit of concentration to make out their contents.\n\nEnglish-language voice acting ranges from good to very poor (everyone is voice acted -- and that will be important for some).  The main character sounds like Charlie Sheen, consider for yourself whether that is a plus or a minus.\n\nPuzzles are varied and inventive.  However, although I would generally consider inventiveness in puzzle design a plus, it does require a slow build-up in order to acclimatise the player -- meaning using a certain gameplay dynamic in puzzles of ever-increasing complexity -- which is something this game doesn't do.  (In other words, some will probably be stumped early on.)\n\nThe storytelling feels similarly rushed:  there is next to no world building, meaning that everything you do is an action that serves to drive the plot forward;  adventure games tend to make use of menial tasks (as components of puzzles) in order to facilitate world building and immerse the player.  This game has very little in the way of menial tasks, aside from a short tutorial, which means that you'll be thrown into a series of locations and situations which were probably interesting in the writer/designer's mind but are boring in their presentation.  For example, take me to some ancient buildings, yes, but do something like the Broken Sword games and make me appreciate that I'm visiting an ancient building.  The game is set in Rome, for crying out loud.  Rome is an interesting place.  Show me Rome!\n\nIn closing, regardless of whether I recommend this or not hardcore adventure gamers will probably buy it.  (As they should.)  For the rest, I don't see why anyone should be spending money on what is in essence the first quarter of a story that you'll never be able to finish.  The game is rather short too.  (And the poor achievement design means you'll need a guide to get 100% -- I guarantee you.)\n\nEither way, in the name of fairness, I'm willing to alter this review to a recommendation should the missing Acts ever be completed and published on Steam.  For all its faults there's a lot of untapped potential here, and I'd love to see where this small but talented team of developers takes this series next (should they take it anywhere at all).\n\n***\n\nEDIT:\n\nAnd here it is!  The second episode is out.\n\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/378630/\n\nI am surprised, but pleasantly so.  For the time being I'll leave this review as is.  Once I've played through Episode II, I plan on coming back and editing it accordingly.\n\nThat means it may become a positive or remain a negative, depending on how well Episode II builds on -- and improves on -- what has gone before.","September 20, 2015","false","1.3"," 28 of 35 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","28","35","0","2"

The first episode of Shadows on the Vatican does not bears the signs of uniqueness, which were to bring a breath of freshness to the genre of point and click. However, Act I: Greed gives us a few hours of solid and pleasant entertainment. The observed defects are not so serious to want to prematurely remove the game from the disk or regret devoted to the completion time. The initial section in the successful style of Roman opens investigation into James Murphy, laying the foundation for a delicious whole. So if you like the novel by Dan Brown and other such stories, give a chance to the project by Italian developers. Really worth.

This is a four game series two of which have been released.  (Shadows of the Vatican Act 1: Greed and Shadows of the Vatican Act 2: Wrath)\n\nStoryline: James Murphy left the priesthood in 1996 after the Vatican's investigation into his mentor's death was less then effective and the Vatican proved to be even less interested.  In present day he is a medical doctor in Chicago, IL (USA).  He has returned to Italy at the request of his friend Father Cristoforo who has urgent and vital information for him.  Before Cristoforo can impart this information to James, Cristoforo is nearly killed when he fell (or was pushed) down a flight of stairs.  In Act 1, James is trying to find out what Cristoforo wanted to tell him by following the clues Cristoforo left for him.\n\nGameplay: Classic type point and game with a strong linear storyline.  The space bar brings up small magnifying glasses for search areas or areas of interest.  Since it is based on a book the storyline follows the plot of the book, and dialogue is essential to follow the story.\n\nDespite the 3D graphics most of the game has, the cutscenes are drawn comic book panels.  This in no way detracts from the gameplay and a simple picture or two progresses the gameplay quickly and concisely.\n\nThere is only one actual puzzle, a maze more concisely, in this game.  It is a car chase!\n\nMystery, intrique, greed, deception and quite possibly murder, what more could anyone want from a thriller?","December 25, 2015","true","4.9"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","14","15","0","0"

There are only (2) out at this time and this review only reflects the first offering. I was really impressed though; it reminded me of Face Noir and other classic and well-crafted Point and Click games. The story is quite original and the voice acting and atmosphere are really on point. The graphics are of good/moderate quality, but the way all the elements come together makes this game pretty special.\n\nThe story follows ex-priest James Murphy, a doctor on leave to visit a friend and former colleague. Things start to unfold when James receives a disturbing call from his friend about a potential conspiracy with the Vatican. Will you be able to solve the mystery and find out what lurks in the shadows?\n\nMy only complaint is the rate at which these games are coming out. The 2nd title came out (16) months after the first was released; although I did really like this game, that's a tremendous amount of time to wait for 3 hour installments. Based on this 16 month guesstimation; part 3 is due out February 2017! I really hope I remember to check it out...\n\nIt's worth the $7; an enjoyable, but short Point and Click.

Graphics are nothing to call home about - passable (I guess?), controls are just fine (usual point & click adventure with some pixel-hunting but not too much).\n\nThe plot is not well set up: after finishing Act I you should AT LEAST have an idea on how good the story's going to be - but barely anything happens, I understand that they cannot unveil too much on the first act but it's just too vague. At this point I have no idea if the story is going to be amazing or a boring, run-of-the-mill, Da Vinci Code-esque type of thing. Pretty bland.\n\nCreativity = 0. If you're a fan of graphic adventure games, all you will do in this game are things you have already done hundreds of times in other mediocre adventures. Things of this sort: find key, use key in the next 2 minutes, get a damp X to clean X, use computer to look up Y information, show item you just found to person Z who is right next to it. There are barely any puzzles too. Nothing to see here.\n\nIt's really short even for an episode-based game. 2,5 hours and I took my time. Again, not really anything substantial.\n\nI won't be purchasing the following acts unless they come in a bundle or are ridiculously cheap at some point.

Experienced point-and-click adventurers might not get enough satisfaction from this act. *\n\nStory‘Shadows on the Vatican’ is a four-part episodic point-and-click adventure series. In its first act, Greed, you are taken back to 1996 when the protagonist, a priest of the Roman Catholic church named James Murphy, witnesses the murder of his mentor - Vatican priest named Dellerio - during a mission in Africa; which is told via reasonably looking comic-like cut scenes. James abandons his priesthood and moves from Italy back to his hometown of Chicago, where he becomes a doctor instead. Fourteen years later, James’ receives an invitation to return to Rome at the request of his friend Cristoforo, who promises to have more information on what really happened in Africa.\n\nVoice-ActingThe story initiates an investigation into a deadly conspiracy that spans continents and decades and perhaps involves some influential members of the Catholic Church.\nThe game, which was originally released back in 2012 in Italy, is now for sale on Steam. Act 1 is fully voice acted, but most of it is not very good. The voice acting is very hit or miss since several important characters sound American - not taking James into account - while the story takes place in the middle of Rome.\n\nVisual StyleAnother disappointing aspect is the extremely visually dated 3D character models. Moreover they do not feel the same as the rest of the game. Greed‘s cut-scenes, menus, maps, character portraits, and inventory items are all hand-drawn - some better than others – but somehow the developers 10th Art Studio and Adventure Productions decided to go with 3D character models and environments instead. Even the free HD-version of the game, which comes with the standard edition after purchase on Steam, does not make these models look even remotely acceptable.\n\nGameplayRegarding the gameplay of this linear and simple build-up adventure, one can luckily be more positive. The developers have used the Wintermute Engine. The same engine that was used in similar games and results in a technically solid game because the engine has already been widely tested.\nAs one can expect from a mouse-driven game James can be moved around by clicking where you want him to go and you click on objects and people to interact with them, using the left and right mouse button each with its specific function. As seems common with modern point and click games, you can press the spacebar to show all the hotspots in the current scene for a few seconds. Moreover, the 'M' key should bring up the map of Rome, but this did not always work. Luckily many of the exits during scenes lead directly to the map.\nAlso the well-designed interface of the inventory makes it easy to collect, combine items and navigate.\n\nConclusionWith an interesting cliffhanger as an ending of the first act, I’m curious to see what roles the different characters play in the story and how the mystery of the Vatican unfolds further. Act 1 has plenty of room for improvement; it provided me just enough build up and introduction to the story, in order to wait for the other episodes. However, experienced point-and-click players might not get enough satisfaction from this act.\nThat being said, the game was initially published in 2012 and the second act is still not available on Steam. Developers claim they are fixing issues and adding extra features for the Steam-version, but multiple release dates have not been met, while “the latest deadline” was actually March 2015.","June 30, 2015","true","2.9"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

With a good plot, acceptable dialogues and painful English voice acting. If this wouldn’t be only the first quarter of a seemingly defunct miniseries, I would wholeheartedly recommend it for anyone.\n\nLong version:As the title suggests, Shadows on the Vatican – Act I: Greed is the first part of a point ‘n’ click adventure game miniseries. That, surprisingly, was made by Italians.\nSurprisingly, since the plot– a thriller set around a financial crime–, the characters, and the art style all point to French bande dessineés (comic albums, where these kinds of stories are quite frequent), not Italian fumettis.\n\nNot that it matters, since what we get is a solid work, although not without flaws. For example the English voiceover is barely tolerable at best. Also, since this is only a quarter of a story, it is quite short and doesn’t answer any questions, only sets up further episodes. And those may never be published at all: when this review was written, only Act II was available from the publisher’s web site.\n\nStill, if you don’t mind watching only the beginning of a thriller and have 2-3 spare hours, this game is an enjoyable way to pass the time.","March 19, 2015","true","3.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The priest-detective concept (fine, ex-priest) is a novel enough idea in games, one I last enjoyed with the Shiva's rabbi. And sure, concpiracies centering around the Vatican are a dime a dozen, but the Italian background of the devs shows in the way they manage to be at the same time respectful and irrereverant, making a commonplace story feel refreshing. The story starts slowly but does a nice job of drawing you in, ending (predictably) with a cliffhanger, but one that made me interested in the episodes to come.\n\nThe writing mainly benefits from having small moments of actual brilliance in characterization, creating unexpectedly endearing portraits of both the hero and many the people you meet, that very much drive the storytelling. And since this is supposed to be the prologue in a 4 part series, there is alot of lovingly crafted character introduction to be had and enjoyed. In fact I have the feeling that it was the memorable characters (and therefore their story) and some decent pacing that caused me to mostly forget there were puzzles there. That, and the fact that they were mostly easy and logical, and that important information was always pointed out to you, more or less inobtrusively.\n\nSome more general stuff: The backgrounds are nicely made, the animation a bit less so but not jarring. I enjoyed the music very much, though the voice acting can be hit and miss. I also had no bugs or technical problems, which I appreciated (since the first time I tried to play the DRM free version a while back I had serious issues - glad to see them fixed). And yes, the game is rather short, which personally doesn't bother me for the price.\n\nAll in all, I was surprised by this one, and will look forward to the next act. It isn't perfect or particularly unique, but it is memorable and endearing, and I very much had fun with it while it lasted.","January 5, 2015","true","2.3"," 34 of 39 people (87%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","87","34","39","3","0"

Indications are the series was canned after the Italian release of Act 2, meaning that for most of the potential audience this is little more than a taster for a story that will never be completed.  That in itself may be enough reason to consider not buying it.  Speaking for myself -- I'm a massive adventure game fan.  Even with knowing that the series would not be going anywhere, I still bought the game and completed it.  (Honestly, because I feel like I need to play everything in the genre ...)\n\nThe controls are fairly standard -- right click to look, left click to interact and/or walk to a point on the screen.\n\nGraphics are mediocre;  the jerky, stiff animations are especially jarring.  There are comic book panels which probably looked good originally, but they were scanned at such a low resolution that they ended up fuzzy and requiring of a fair bit of concentration to make out their contents.\n\nEnglish-language voice acting ranges from good to very poor (everyone is voice acted -- and that will be important for some).  The main character sounds like Charlie Sheen, consider for yourself whether that is a plus or a minus.\n\nPuzzles are varied and inventive.  However, although I would generally consider inventiveness in puzzle design a plus, it does require a slow build-up in order to acclimatise the player -- meaning using a certain gameplay dynamic in puzzles of ever-increasing complexity -- which is something this game doesn't do.  (In other words, some will probably be stumped early on.)\n\nThe storytelling feels similarly rushed:  there is next to no world building, meaning that everything you do is an action that serves to drive the plot forward;  adventure games tend to make use of menial tasks (as components of puzzles) in order to facilitate world building and immerse the player.  This game has very little in the way of menial tasks, aside from a short tutorial, which means that you'll be thrown into a series of locations and situations which were probably interesting in the writer/designer's mind but are boring in their presentation.  For example, take me to some ancient buildings, yes, but do something like the Broken Sword games and make me appreciate that I'm visiting an ancient building.  The game is set in Rome, for crying out loud.  Rome is an interesting place.  Show me Rome!\n\nIn closing, regardless of whether I recommend this or not hardcore adventure gamers will probably buy it.  (As they should.)  For the rest, I don't see why anyone should be spending money on what is in essence the first quarter of a story that you'll never be able to finish.  The game is rather short too.  (And the poor achievement design means you'll need a guide to get 100% -- I guarantee you.)\n\nEither way, in the name of fairness, I'm willing to alter this review to a recommendation should the missing Acts ever be completed and published on Steam.  For all its faults there's a lot of untapped potential here, and I'd love to see where this small but talented team of developers takes this series next (should they take it anywhere at all).\n\n***\n\nEDIT:\n\nAnd here it is!  The second episode is out.\n\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/378630/\n\nI am surprised, but pleasantly so.  For the time being I'll leave this review as is.  Once I've played through Episode II, I plan on coming back and editing it accordingly.\n\nThat means it may become a positive or remain a negative, depending on how well Episode II builds on -- and improves on -- what has gone before.","September 20, 2015","false","1.3"," 28 of 35 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","28","35","0","2"

The first episode of Shadows on the Vatican does not bears the signs of uniqueness, which were to bring a breath of freshness to the genre of point and click. However, Act I: Greed gives us a few hours of solid and pleasant entertainment. The observed defects are not so serious to want to prematurely remove the game from the disk or regret devoted to the completion time. The initial section in the successful style of Roman opens investigation into James Murphy, laying the foundation for a delicious whole. So if you like the novel by Dan Brown and other such stories, give a chance to the project by Italian developers. Really worth.

This is a four game series two of which have been released.  (Shadows of the Vatican Act 1: Greed and Shadows of the Vatican Act 2: Wrath)\n\nStoryline: James Murphy left the priesthood in 1996 after the Vatican's investigation into his mentor's death was less then effective and the Vatican proved to be even less interested.  In present day he is a medical doctor in Chicago, IL (USA).  He has returned to Italy at the request of his friend Father Cristoforo who has urgent and vital information for him.  Before Cristoforo can impart this information to James, Cristoforo is nearly killed when he fell (or was pushed) down a flight of stairs.  In Act 1, James is trying to find out what Cristoforo wanted to tell him by following the clues Cristoforo left for him.\n\nGameplay: Classic type point and game with a strong linear storyline.  The space bar brings up small magnifying glasses for search areas or areas of interest.  Since it is based on a book the storyline follows the plot of the book, and dialogue is essential to follow the story.\n\nDespite the 3D graphics most of the game has, the cutscenes are drawn comic book panels.  This in no way detracts from the gameplay and a simple picture or two progresses the gameplay quickly and concisely.\n\nThere is only one actual puzzle, a maze more concisely, in this game.  It is a car chase!\n\nMystery, intrique, greed, deception and quite possibly murder, what more could anyone want from a thriller?","December 25, 2015","true","4.9"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","14","15","0","0"

The three and a half hours it took me to complete it served to build up a tense atmosphere that began to draw me into the plot. Sadly however, it ended abruptly and very frustratingly, with nothing resolved.\n\nI am not sure about these episodic adventures. On the one hand, it is understandable that developers need to release titles in parts as they need the finance to finish off the game, but on the other hand it can be very frustrating for the player that enjoys the full works. I guess this has to do with the generally low price of retail nowadays, compared to, say 15 - 20 years ago when full, long games cost at least 10 times as much. So it's not surprising short episodic chunks are being brought to us.\n\nThe graphics are good and easily serve the purpose, creating a solid atmosphere. The dialogue and voice work is very well done. The main character is particularly well-voiced. The puzzles are mostly very easy as everything points the player in the right direction. The only time I had any length of difficulty (and it wasn't very long) was in a pixel puzzle where something needed to be picked up to move the story along.\n\nI notice that the second episode came out two years after this one. There are supposed to be 4 episodes in all, so it looks like this game won't be concluded for another 4 years, if the developers keep at it. Thus, I'm going to sit it out and wait for the rest to be released before I play anymore.","May 17, 2015","true","3.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Graphics are nothing to call home about - passable (I guess?), controls are just fine (usual point & click adventure with some pixel-hunting but not too much).\n\nThe plot is not well set up: after finishing Act I you should AT LEAST have an idea on how good the story's going to be - but barely anything happens, I understand that they cannot unveil too much on the first act but it's just too vague. At this point I have no idea if the story is going to be amazing or a boring, run-of-the-mill, Da Vinci Code-esque type of thing. Pretty bland.\n\nCreativity = 0.

Experienced point-and-click adventurers might not get enough satisfaction from this act. *\n\nStory‘Shadows on the Vatican’ is a four-part episodic point-and-click adventure series. In its first act, Greed, you are taken back to 1996 when the protagonist, a priest of the Roman Catholic church named James Murphy, witnesses the murder of his mentor - Vatican priest named Dellerio - during a mission in Africa; which is told via reasonably looking comic-like cut scenes. James abandons his priesthood and moves from Italy back to his hometown of Chicago, where he becomes a doctor instead. Fourteen years later, James’ receives an invitation to return to Rome at the request of his friend Cristoforo, who promises to have more information on what really happened in Africa.\n\nVoice-ActingThe story initiates an investigation into a deadly conspiracy that spans continents and decades and perhaps involves some influential members of the Catholic Church.\nThe game, which was originally released back in 2012 in Italy, is now for sale on Steam. Act 1 is fully voice acted, but most of it is not very good. The voice acting is very hit or miss since several important characters sound American - not taking James into account - while the story takes place in the middle of Rome.\n\nVisual StyleAnother disappointing aspect is the extremely visually dated 3D character models. Moreover they do not feel the same as the rest of the game. Greed‘s cut-scenes, menus, maps, character portraits, and inventory items are all hand-drawn - some better than others – but somehow the developers 10th Art Studio and Adventure Productions decided to go with 3D character models and environments instead. Even the free HD-version of the game, which comes with the standard edition after purchase on Steam, does not make these models look even remotely acceptable.\n\nGameplayRegarding the gameplay of this linear and simple build-up adventure, one can luckily be more positive. The developers have used the Wintermute Engine. The same engine that was used in similar games and results in a technically solid game because the engine has already been widely tested.\nAs one can expect from a mouse-driven game James can be moved around by clicking where you want him to go and you click on objects and people to interact with them, using the left and right mouse button each with its specific function. As seems common with modern point and click games, you can press the spacebar to show all the hotspots in the current scene for a few seconds. Moreover, the 'M' key should bring up the map of Rome, but this did not always work. Luckily many of the exits during scenes lead directly to the map.\nAlso the well-designed interface of the inventory makes it easy to collect, combine items and navigate.\n\nConclusionWith an interesting cliffhanger as an ending of the first act, I’m curious to see what roles the different characters play in the story and how the mystery of the Vatican unfolds further. Act 1 has plenty of room for improvement; it provided me just enough build up and introduction to the story, in order to wait for the other episodes. However, experienced point-and-click players might not get enough satisfaction from this act.\nThat being said, the game was initially published in 2012 and the second act is still not available on Steam. Developers claim they are fixing issues and adding extra features for the Steam-version, but multiple release dates have not been met, while “the latest deadline” was actually March 2015.","June 30, 2015","true","2.9"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

I was very impressed. 8/10\n\nGameplay: Click and touch. Requires intelligence and logic to keep playing. The plot was not as boring as other people said so, it was interesting for me to continue playing. However I had to refer to YouTube for walkthrough hints when I got stuck a couple of times because this game has no hints-you have to try all the possiblities like mix and matching the differnent items in your inventory with one another and also with the environment. Dialogue wise voice acting was superb for a game like this but some conversations are rather obnoxious and I had to skip it. 5.5/10\n\nThats all for this review I rate it 6.7/10. Worth buying when on sale. I learnt a lot on Italian history and their language when playing this. This game is based in Rome.","June 23, 2015","true","4.0"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

With a good plot, acceptable dialogues and painful English voice acting. If this wouldn’t be only the first quarter of a seemingly defunct miniseries, I would wholeheartedly recommend it for anyone.\n\nLong version:As the title suggests, Shadows on the Vatican – Act I: Greed is the first part of a point ‘n’ click adventure game miniseries. That, surprisingly, was made by Italians.\nSurprisingly, since the plot– a thriller set around a financial crime–, the characters, and the art style all point to French bande dessineés (comic albums, where these kinds of stories are quite frequent), not Italian fumettis.\n\nNot that it matters, since what we get is a solid work, although not without flaws. For example the English voiceover is barely tolerable at best. Also, since this is only a quarter of a story, it is quite short and doesn’t answer any questions, only sets up further episodes. And those may never be published at all: when this review was written, only Act II was available from the publisher’s web site.\n\nStill, if you don’t mind watching only the beginning of a thriller and have 2-3 spare hours, this game is an enjoyable way to pass the time.","March 19, 2015","true","3.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I found that the game was quite fresh for a person like me, who prefers a good Strategy over P&C adventure games. The game puts you, James, into a puzzle filled quest as you strive to find out clues as to why your coma induced friend is leaving you clues.\n\nThis game is easy to complete, I did it in roughly 1.5 hours. So for a short space of time, it is an excellent time killer, also the game was free anyway, so for a free game it isn't that bad in all honesty. The only negative aspect of this game is that the character walks too slow, but then again, that is tradition with Adventure games such as Monkey Island & Broken Sword.\n\nOverall, 8/10, no Catholic Priests touched me.","June 6, 2015","true","1.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The three and a half hours it took me to complete it served to build up a tense atmosphere that began to draw me into the plot. Sadly however, it ended abruptly and very frustratingly, with nothing resolved.\n\nI am not sure about these episodic adventures. On the one hand, it is understandable that developers need to release titles in parts as they need the finance to finish off the game, but on the other hand it can be very frustrating for the player that enjoys the full works. I guess this has to do with the generally low price of retail nowadays, compared to, say 15 - 20 years ago when full, long games cost at least 10 times as much. So it's not surprising short episodic chunks are being brought to us.\n\nThe graphics are good and easily serve the purpose, creating a solid atmosphere. The dialogue and voice work is very well done. The main character is particularly well-voiced. The puzzles are mostly very easy as everything points the player in the right direction. The only time I had any length of difficulty (and it wasn't very long) was in a pixel puzzle where something needed to be picked up to move the story along.\n\nI notice that the second episode came out two years after this one. There are supposed to be 4 episodes in all, so it looks like this game won't be concluded for another 4 years, if the developers keep at it. Thus, I'm going to sit it out and wait for the rest to be released before I play anymore.","May 17, 2015","true","3.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I'd have liked a bit more freedom in playing or maybe even the opportunity to play a different character... For example, if anyone's played a Dragon Age game, there's a whole religion thing going on there but you don't have to be a part of it, you can choose to disregard it or to join it or whatever. In this game, you're forced to be a former priest. Sounds insignificant but I would have liked the game more if I'd had more freedom in my character or at least what I do - The fact that he was religious meant I couldn't just choose to go and say, kill someone or even bother not bandaging the guy at the beginning.

You play the part of an ex-priest called in to\nsolve a mystery that surrounds the church and the Vatican.\n\nThe tutorial does a good job of showing you how to play, while\nremaining integrated into the story.  The voice acting was mostly\nperformed in a professional manner, and the art style was good, but the animations\nof the characters were robotic and doll-like.\n\nAs a detective game, it did a poor job of drawing you to the next clue,\ninstead forcing you to look for the smallest of objects.  This coupled with being unable to make leaps in logic, instead being forced to complete every task,\nin order, made it rather frustrating.\n\nAs I said before, the main character is a former priest who takes on\nthe role of detective.  Sometimes the writing tries to justify\nreligious arguments logically without taking into account that the\nmain character is currently in conflict with his religious beliefs,\nmaking it seem somewhat forced, and more difficult to connect with\nhim due to how he responds to people in the world.\n\nIn the adventure part, I know why I am here, what I am doing, where I am going, and who I am talking with. As well as having the information on my back story and small to large info on the back story of supporting characters. It gives you the information you need to progress with out feeling like you do not understand what is going on around you.\n\nUnfortunately the flaws of this game outweighed it's good points,\nmaking me unable to recommend it.\n\nThe video offers a much deeper in look as this is a brief summary.\nThanks for your viewership and support for more videos check click here.\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/SocioPyscho","August 27, 2014","false","0.2"," 10 of 23 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","10","23","0","0"

I'd have liked a bit more freedom in playing or maybe even the opportunity to play a different character... For example, if anyone's played a Dragon Age game, there's a whole religion thing going on there but you don't have to be a part of it, you can choose to disregard it or to join it or whatever. In this game, you're forced to be a former priest. Sounds insignificant but I would have liked the game more if I'd had more freedom in my character or at least what I do - The fact that he was religious meant I couldn't just choose to go and say, kill someone or even bother not bandaging the guy at the beginning. You have to be the nice guy.","March 10","false","4.9"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

You play the part of an ex-priest called in to\nsolve a mystery that surrounds the church and the Vatican.\n\nThe tutorial does a good job of showing you how to play, while\nremaining integrated into the story.  The voice acting was mostly\nperformed in a professional manner, and the art style was good, but the animations\nof the characters were robotic and doll-like.\n\nAs a detective game, it did a poor job of drawing you to the next clue,\ninstead forcing you to look for the smallest of objects.  This coupled with being unable to make leaps in logic, instead being forced to complete every task,\nin order, made it rather frustrating.\n\nAs I said before, the main character is a former priest who takes on\nthe role of detective.  Sometimes the writing tries to justify\nreligious arguments logically without taking into account that the\nmain character is currently in conflict with his religious beliefs,\nmaking it seem somewhat forced, and more difficult to connect with\nhim due to how he responds to people in the world.\n\nIn the adventure part, I know why I am here, what I am doing, where I am going, and who I am talking with. As well as having the information on my back story and small to large info on the back story of supporting characters. It gives you the information you need to progress with out feeling like you do not understand what is going on around you.\n\nUnfortunately the flaws of this game outweighed it's good points,\nmaking me unable to recommend it.\n\nThe video offers a much deeper in look as this is a brief summary.\nThanks for your viewership and support for more videos check click here.\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/SocioPyscho","August 27, 2014","false","0.2"," 10 of 23 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","10","23","0","0"

It could be hard if you are new to the Point & Click games. The scenes look nice and the dialog was interesting and fun. The big downside of this game is the short 3 to 4 hour playtime.

I enjoy playing it. It's about 4 hours to play. It's classic adventure game with logical puzzles. The puzzles are not too hard, but just hard enough. The ambient music is awsome,  I love music in the capena church. The actor voices are good enough. The story is great and good implemented with puzzles. You can read some books to know more about the story. The dialogs are good and classic written. I love the inventory. Its easy and functional.
