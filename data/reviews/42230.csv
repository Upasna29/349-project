I give it a 6/10, but if your more of a mainstream gamer, I wouldnt suggest this game to you, its for those who enjoy casual games.","December 2, 2013","true","7.6"," 15 of 16 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","15","16","0","0"

The plotline of the game is stale and short. Most tasks are not part of solving the mystery, but rather errands and chores given by other characters. The game is also disappointingly short. I finished the game in two short sittings (Steam records that I played 11 hours but this is incorrect; I have been experiencing some home IT issues that increased my calculated gameplay). Other ND mysteries have at least held my attention through a few difficult puzzle series. The "size" of the environment was also far too small. The whole game is spent in three small areas: a house, a barn, and a shop (3 rooms in the house, 2 rooms in the shop, and 1 barn area). The only exceptions are the outside area (where 2 activities are held)  and driving on the roads (which was more of an annoyance than a fun game element). Trail of the Twister is unfortunately my least favorite Nancy Drew game yet. I hope Her Interactive can step up their game and bring back the excitement seen in games like Ghost Dogs of Moon Lake and The Curse of Blackmoor Manor.","July 22, 2015","false","11.6"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

It is really sad what's happened to the Nancy Drew games. They really used to be great. Everything I've played after Blackmoor Manor (which was excellent by the way) are absolute garbage and not worth anyone's money.\nIf you want to play a Nancy Drew game, I highly recomend Treasure in the Royal Tower, Secret of the Scarlet Hand, and the aforementioned Curse of Blackmoor Manor.","March 31, 2014","false","3.5"," 5 of 14 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","5","14","0","2"

The gritty, in the fray writing style draws you in and the character development keeps you wanting more. Indeed, during the climatic fight scene on top of the empire state buliding i found myself locked in my seat, heart pounding, sweat pouring down my face as i gripped my seat in expectation. The true message of the story; that of marxism in german society in the 1920's, is subtly conveyed through the prowess of some of the finest voice actors of this century. The character dynamic was excellent, each cast member playing off of the other in an intense waltz of cinematic quality drama. This game has set a new standard for mystery thirllers, the emotional up's and down's it evokes can be found nowhere else.","October 7, 2011","true","0.0"," 4 of 16 people (25%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","25","4","16","4","0"

If you like solving puzzles, then this is your game. (I made frequent stops to the barn to mess with the circuit boards) This is one of those timeline games where you do certain tasks and then told to go to bed. One of the last days it took forever for me to find the flag to let you go to bed. Had to google it. Found that others were having this problem. Plot line was straight forward, it didn't take me long to solve.\n\nIt's much better the Ransom of Seven Ships, but is not one of my favorites. I would recommend Ghost Dogs of Moon Lake if you're looking for this sort of genre of Nancy Drew games.","November 6, 2015","false","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
