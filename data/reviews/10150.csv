The superpowered gameplay is definitely my favorite part, there are many ways to win the major story battles and sidemissions with the various moves at your command. As Alex Mercer, you can either pick up guns and rocket launchers or become a weapon yourself by shape shifting your body into claws, blades, bludgeons, whips and even a cannon ball move that launches you toward your target with enough force to blow up armored vehicles later in the game. Speaking of armored vehicles, you can hijack tanks and skyjack helicopter gunships (and this even looks exactly like that scene in T2 where the T-1000 gets on that chopper and tells the guy to get out LOL). When on foot and exploring Manhatten you use your augmented abilities to parkour the landscape, at full upgrades you can leap over 5 story buildings easily and glide / airdash through the air very similiarly to how mario from Super Mario World glides with the super cape. There is an element of Metal Gear Solid in this game too since you can shape shift into other people that you consume, ie soldiers or pedestrians in the street in order to blend in since the military is constantly looking for you. The story mode is pretty unique: your character wakes up having exactly the same knowledge the player does as to what is going on, and through a mechanic known as the web of intrigue you eventually come to understand the game's story and background on everything that is going on around you. As you explore Manhatten you will find people with the Web of Intrigue icon over their head indicating that they can be consumed by you to learn what they know in connection to everything that happened. This game features sidemissions that show up on the game's minimap that will showcase your skills with the various abilities you acquire and see how fast you can be parkouring from place to place and get bronze/silver/gold/platinum medals depending on your 1337ness.\n\nI started playing this and finished it in about a week, making sure to get every sidemission completed on platinum. Because the plot is advanced through Web of Intrigue it is possible to finish the game without getting every bit of story out of it so I did a new game+ to find the remaining consume targets to get the whole story. For the most part the main story missions are easy with some tricky boss fights that really make you use all of your abilities to some degree, the most challenging aspect of this game is definitely getting platinum in every sidemission (think classic NES game level challenging). Overall I give this game a solid recommendation for its fluid gameplay (I love the parkour!) :)\n\n\n","February 17, 2014","true","49.9"," 131 of 146 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","131","146","0","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gosedre/recommended/10150/","gosedre","Gosedre","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gosedre/","215 products in account","I like the concept of the anti-hero. You play as Alex Mercer, an infected, who unlike other infected people turned to a superhuman with extraordinary abilities. You can run, jump at high speed. I almost said you can also climb but that is not true as you simply run on the side of multi-storey buildings. Everything is easily accessible.\n\nYou have the usual action-adventure free roaming concept here: beacons indicate the starting points of missions so once you approach them a cutscene continues the story and your mission begins. Other than that you go wherever you want and whenever you want. And where? In New York. There are recognisable landmarks and as you can guess the map is quite huge - in fact, certain parts are only accessible at a later stage in the story.\n\nThere are many collectibles and you also gather experience points for everything you pick up. This enables you to purchase further upgrades and the stronger you get the more exciting each battle is. Upgrades usually mean a new method of transformation - your arms become tentacles and you can smash or slice everything up. Certain enemy types can only be defeated by certain melee methods so there's variety here and the game is challenging as requires your attention.\n\nThe only issue with Prototype is the places where you are indoors. The ceiling is high up as they want you to be able to jump equally high as outdoors but due to the limited space in the rooms / halls fights are usually difficult in these places. Other than this Prototype is a very interesting, action-driven TPS game that delivers an excellent shape-shifting combat and your protagonist's agility makes free-roaming very exciting.","November 8, 2015","true","31.1"," 98 of 105 people (93%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","93","98","105","9","3"

RPGish progress where you spent evolution points on power upgrades and new tricks is well done. Surprisingly the story is pretty good as well, and there is a decent plot twiss. The graphics were dated when this game was released now they are pretty crappy but that does not take the awesomeness of the game. Flaws? Well the graphic for one, bad side-missions, repetitive NPC models making you feel like in clone wars. Nothing major.The combat can get a bit repetitive if you don't mix things up.

All you know is that you are Alex Mercer, who has been shot down and fatally wounded and later on got infected by a virus that somehow revived you and gave you shapeshifting abilities and superpowers.\n\nNow he is trying everything he can to find out how all this happened, where it will be going, and how he could possibly end all this by "interrogate" the ones responsible.\nMaking your way through the story you get sucked in by a good load of interesting twists, challenging bossfights and tons of upgrades for Alex that make him the toughest enemy "Blackwatch" will have to face during the whole infection.\n\nThere are plenty of Sidequests to be done - some of them nice and some of them just to keep you busy finishing the game 100%. But if you focus on the Story Quests alone its possible to finish it within ~12 hours on a medium difficulty.\nIt can be frustrating at times (not just because of the AI) but because of overpowered attacs or wrong set "Mission Failure" parts, but once you've beaten the game it feels really satisfying even without Steam Achievments or cool costume unlocks for Alex Mercer. The gameplay itself is (to me) almost flawless and the possibilities endless due to Alex' powers and the maybe best looking armor in 2009's video games.\n\nWith this being said I'd like to leave you the decision if you should get this game on a sale for 5 bucks or just let it be, all I can do is just highly recommend it to everyone who loves a good classic and a game by 'Activision' that is not "Fast and the Furious" nor "Call of Duty" but actually a GOOD game.\nA point some people might find interesting- the graphics are not horribly bad but neither outstanding for 2009...something in between should describe it precisely. If graphics don't bother you its a perfect game for a casual afternoon when you are off work and just want to relax..in case you do love good graphics take a look at Prototype 2 ..it has all the features 1 has to offer and even more - will write a review to part 2 aswell once I finished it on Steam.\n\n*Note* I wasn't experiencing any performance problems on my nvidia card but I know that there are massive problems with all AMD cards... and they wont ever fix it I believe so in case you don't have a Nvidia graphics card you might want to play this one on a console.\n\nAs always I hope that my review was helpful and written understandable and made it easier for you to decide to buy a game from 6 years ago that is still more foward than todays releases...","July 5, 2015","true","12.9"," 78 of 83 people (94%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","94","78","83","10","4"

Outside of the lackluster stealth and disguising mechanic, the brutal combat, huge open-world, varied challenges, and utterly satisfying gameplay makes this a must-have title for any serious gamer's collection. Although it’s beset by blandish graphics and wickedly uneven difficulty, Prototype delivers a fast-paced, relentlessly amoral and wonderfully brutal sandbox adventure in a detailed city filled with cool things to see and do.This open-world action game set in Manhattan is proof that even viral outbreaks can be incredibly fun if they're done right. A dark and brutal superhero-comic come alive. Prototype offers more than enough room for criticism due to its simple mission-design, unlovely graphics and boneheaded AI. Nevertheless it also copes with creating the intensive atmosphere of a city on the brink of disaster and of the player being the ultimate superhero, therefore resulting in a gameplay experience that is by far greater than the sum of its parts.If you’re a fan of superhero games or just love gratuitous violence, you can’t go wrong with Prototype.I wholeheartedly recommend it, with a small caution sign reserved for the little ones, because the game is violent on quite a large scale.","May 5, 2014","true","111.2"," 83 of 93 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","83","93","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/whatsacanada/recommended/10150/","whatsacanada","Alcatraz Zombie (broken PC)","http://steamcommunity.com/id/whatsacanada/","145 products in account","Honestly, this is probably one of the best open world games made to date. Even though the graphics are slightly dated it doesn't detract from the experience at all. You play as Alex Mercer, a man who woke up in a morgue with little to no memory of who he is or what happened to him. The entire story isn't handed to you by playing through the main missions, in order to fully understand what's happening to you and New York, you will need to seek out certain key people marked as Web of Intrigue targets. Hunting these people down and consuming them will give you pieces of the story, this method of storytelling is pretty interesting and made me want to keep searching just to figure out what the hell happened. By consuming powerful enemies you add new powers and abilities to your arsenal. I don't think there are many other games that can make you feel like an unstoppable badass that leaves a trail of death and destruction wherever you go like Prototype does. Just to clarify, you won't be so overpowered that you'll never have a challenge. As you progress through the game, the military will adapt and start making things a bit more difficult for you. They have viral detectors that can see through your disguise, supersoldiers that can match your strength, and there are times when your cover is blown and you'll end up fighting multiple tanks and strike teams of apache helicopters, so it can get pretty hectic if you don't know what you're doing. However, if you manage your powers pretty well and know what situations to use them for, even if ♥♥♥♥ hits the fan and you're under attack from all directions you can still come out on top fairly easily. Especially with the use of devastator attacks that have a large area of effect and can quickly turn the tide in your favor.\n\nTL;DR version: You're a badass with a lot of powers and you can do a lot of cool stuff.\n\nOverall I give it a solid 9/10. I highly recommend you get it if you see it on sale.","December 30, 2014","true","35.2"," 65 of 69 people (94%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","94","65","69","7","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Owlakki/recommended/10150/","Owlakki","Owlakki™ 5 days til birthday","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Owlakki/","441 products in account","Prototype is a game that I mostly consider very underrated that has unfortunately been long forgotten by the press and players alike. It's a very good example of a game that comes across as very generic but subverts your expectations.\n\nYou play as Alex Mercer, a man seemingly infected with a virus that allows him to shapeshift and consume people. He starts out having amnesia and for the first half of the game comes across as extremely edgy. The characters and dialogue are very hamfisted and the scenarios the game throws at you are ridiculous to the point of being absurd.\n\nHowever during the second half the writing starts to become more clever. The protagonist has a very noticeable character arc that I grew to like, and the general progression of the game from this seemingly pristine city to a demonic hellish Manhattan really gripped me a great deal. This weaved very nicely with the gameplay.\n\nPrototype isn't a game that aged very well, and was pretty antiquated even when it first game out. Realism is thrown completely out the window as you regularly fly across cityscapes, run into npcs and absorb them into your body, and grow giant swords out of your arms to destroy tanks. It also hasn't aged very well graphically. However the controls are very flowy and I greatly enjoyed exploring the world. I also enjoyed how the player's powers upgrade gradually as you consume more people and found it appealed to my very morbid sense of humor. It also features a neat New Game plus mode.\n\nRegardless, I recognize a lot of what I like Prototype for is very subjective. Objectively it's a very average game, and not one people are going to really remember 10 years from now. But it's still a game I like, and if you can find it for very cheap on sale you'll find a very charming sandbox game. Not the best but certainly not the worst.","December 22, 2015","true","3.3"," 64 of 69 people (93%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","93","64","69","3","0"

Also, the game can be very unforgiving at times, and the first playthrough can be a hassle even on the easiest difficulty.\nOverall graphics are okay, but it takes somewhat of a penalty because you could probably count the amount of different generic NPC models on two hands.\nHowever, what makes this game worth the 20 bucks is the sandboxing. Plug in some headphones and just parkour around Manhattan, consume an army man and help take down an infected hive, hunt for collectibles, go on a zombie killing spree, play fetch with living people, troll the military, invade a base stealthily or guns blazing, go postal with a rifle in a civilian zone, hijack a helicopter and shoot at tanks, hijack a tank and shoot at helicopters, whip out your claws and slice people in half, eat living things until your hunger is satisfied, or do various "events" around the city (races, gliding to a specific target, war events, and just flat out murder events). There's no shortage of fun to be had.\nThis game is amazing for killing time AND blowing off steam. You can play it for 15 minutes at a time, or 5 hours at a time. It's the kind of game you can't really ever get tired of.\nMy only real qualm with the game is that there's too many tanks and helicopters that spawn in. You have to be extremely careful about screwing around on foot, especially after you've beaten the story, because tanks will spawn wherever you are and even if they're far away on the minimap, they'll converge towards you and wipe out what little fun you thought you could have. And don't even think about taking on the tanks, because that'll just make more of them spawn, and a strike team is almost guaranteed to be called in as well (and another one, and another one, if your wanted level persists).

Not as unknown as it was when I bought it because of its sequel, but still quite underrated. It has a decent story, despite it's about a failed experiment/mutated people/zombies.\nI really liked that, unlike the other games about that topic, you are an infected one, and not a survivor, but even the infected ones tryto kill you. Basically, you're a solitary overpowered mutant that everyone wants dead and doesn't remember who he is and has to consume targets that have memories about that to remember it.\nIt has a quite good graphics ( considering it's a 2009 game) and a good gameplay.\nThe only thing, it gets quite repetitive when all you have to do is to infiltrate in military bases, destroy zombie hives and machines that emit poisonous fog, but at the start and at the end the missions are more interesting.\nOn easy it's reaaally easy, as you are an overpowered mutant capable of regenerating consumating people or infected ones, taking other people's appearence, running on walls , making your limbs become weapons, stealing tanks, ecc...\nAfter you have completed the main quest if you want you can play another time without having to unlock everything you unlocked during the first time.","November 3, 2014","true","17.5"," 29 of 31 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","29","31","0","0"

Throw your pedestrian as far as you can, see if you can land exactly where they do, before they do.\nFans of the Hulk games on PS2 and XBOX will note that in terms of mechanics at least, this is a colossal rip-off.

Having evolution points to spend on power upgrades and trying to combine them to a combo is what makes this game interesting. There are also checkpoints where you can go and do some mini-games.

I must admit, there were some minor silly parts in the game that made me wonder, but overall, the game is great if you're like me. I even had writer's block when I got the game, and now I'm right back to writing, and not doing my homework. I've been back to waking up early in the morning just to play this game and see what's next. The main character, Alex Mercer, is very unique in many ways, and I grew very attached to him. Very.\nI am very thankful that I got this game and not the sequel, Prototype 2, which as far as I've heard, is a piece of crap in many different ways.

The Difficulty!\n\nIt can range GREATLY across all pre-set difficulties.  Even on easy, enemies can bum rush you like no business and just bombard you with rockets, bullets and the explosives of the army kind.  Hunters can just wipe your health bar away if you don't act fast enough.  Even your standard army mook with a rocket launcher can be a pesky jerk, especially when there is more than one.  You gotta be on your toes or the bad guys will utterly destroy you.\n\nThe lock-on system...bleh.  I dread it.  It's just...eugh.  The camera is just ruined everytime I lock on, and it doesn't help when so many people just zerg rush you to hell.  Gee, I want to turn the camera to better see the environment! OOPS!  It instead jerks around to the only other enemy and just disorients me.  Maybe it's just me...not being used to any sort of lock on, but I'd rather set the lock on to target the biggest threat or the mission objective (be it a foe) while keeping the camera semi loose so you can still keep situational awareness and don't get blasted to Timbucktoo.\n\nOf course Radical Entertainment is about as dead as every helicopter I've encountered.\n\nThe Story...um...it's nothing to really to talk about.  Other than some of the missions being BRUTALLY hard, even bordering on unfair, and with the final boss being a good stomp to the nuts.\n\nThe vehicles kinda feel like a joke or just some plain therapy.  In combat their about as flimsy as a deck of cards, but just for roaming around, running over random cars, it's pretty neat.  Helicopters are just...no.\n\nI've only encountered one crash so far, and that's after almost 6-12 hours of play.  The game's graphics are...OK for it's time, it's (probably) just a cut above Goat Simulator.  The max resolution is quite limited, and the amount of options there are for fine tuning your performance...well...it's nothing to talk about.  Just like this game's story.\n\nRegardless...this game is a gem in the rough.  If you just want to beatdown enemies so strongly that they just gib, collect goodies that are scattered all around NYC, and do little side missions, don't be afraid to take a second look at this.","November 6, 2014","true","26.6"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","0"

The concept of playing an amnesic and vindictive superhero in an open world sounds very interesting/appealing.  Prototype is a very fun game when it tries to give the player strong sensations through action.  However, the game has several problems that almost turned me off.  The side missions were boring and very repetitive.  I was not interesting in the lore/story line of these missions.  Fortunately, the main quest has a coherent, decent story that kept me on track.  I wanted to know what would happen next to Alex Mercer and I cared about him.  The fight scenes are really cool and make you feel like a total bad ♥♥♥!

The game is captivating enough to draw me away from sensing if the graphics are too minimal or too maximum.

First, the combat; true the combat could be better, it would be nice if there was a more stratiegic way to dive into the combat, but it makes up for the lack of difficulty with a lot of heart-pounding, edge of the seat action. The combat animation in this game is beautifuly gory, and well animated, and brutal and it makes you feel like a walking weapon. However, an open world is only as good as the way you travel through it, and when you move through this game you feel like a SUPER HERO. A mix of parkour and power-based traversal it is so, so satisfying. As is the open world, a sandbox is only as good as the contents of the world. The map is filled with these little side missions that are a good distraction for about a minute, but going on a masacre and slaughtering the militery makes up for that. As far as the story goes, it's...okay. Now I'm only about two hours into the game, and there are some aspects of the story that I love, however the game makes me hate those. I want to unravle the mystery surrounding the main character's past, but there's this infection spreading through out the city, I'm just gonna go deal with this and...oh wait, no I'm not. That aside I do LOVE this game and I can definety reccomend it for $20.00.

After playing it for about an hour, I really like this game. It has a GTA-ish vibe to it since it is set in NYC. You play as Alex Mercer who remembers nothing about what has happened to him or the city that he lives in (Which is in a rampage.) You go around consuming people to regain your memories. I love the fact that this game has extra things to do besides Campaign. It features several Landmarks bubbles that when you collect, give you points to spend on decking Alex out with upgrades such as sneak cloning and a huge defense shield. Although this game is really fun to play, I do have some cons: To start off with, when trying to be stealth you're not exactly disguised as police officers and such will act "suspicious" several times my cover will be blown and then I have to run away for a short amount of time. My only other con is that Alex sometimes can move a tad too fast as if you try climbing buildings and such, you can fall off by accident due to how fast he is. Still this is game is a HUGE pickup since it is for sale at the moment. I always want to mention, controller support is AMAZING. All you do is plug the controller in and you're good to go. Someone asked me if this game is hard to run. My answer is NO. The game is a bit old since it came out in 2009 and my temporary rig that consists of an Intel i3 @ 2.40GHz (Quad Core) which runs it smooth and 30 fps on all low (W/ Shadows.) which in my opinion still looks good.","July 20, 2014","true","5.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It's really fun to glide around the city. It feels that Alex Mercer is some sort of superhero. YOU HAVE SO MUCH POWER!!! But it is a pity that the storyline has to be linear. If only you had a chioce to be a hero not only just a virus. Storyline is ok, with a twist at the end for the boss fight. The game gets a bit repititive after you get the whip ability. All you have to do is just jump>whip>dodge>whip>jump and you just keep doing that for every boss fight, including ending the game. The idea of the Web Of Intrigue is a pretty cool way to tell a story and paint the back-storyline.\nThe auto aim is ok, but sometimes it's hard to aim a targetwhen there are multiple targets on your screen.\n\nOverall, it's fun and worth it's value.\n\n"like GTA but with tentacle powers"","May 3, 2014","true","24.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

There is no possible way to make a blood less playthrough.  With that out of the way, this game is bloody fun.  Open world slaughter with a decent story.  This is like the ultimate super hero game is super heroes killed everyone and just self centred.  The powers in this game is awesome, a sword and tons of other weapons at your disposale to kill and do anything in this world.  Yes this game is really cool, but there are a few bad things.  It's too easy, it takes one hit to kill almost every single person, the only ones that can take 5-10 hits are the infected, but even then they are a bit too easy.  You will die once in awhile if you decide to attract too many soldiers at once you will get surronded and get shot.  Also sometimes when running if there is a bit of a dip, then you won't be able to climb the building unless you jump.

Alex truly feels powerful which reduces the army to mere hurdles to overcome. I loved the variety of powers and their destructive finesse. Unfortunately the missions boil down to the same things over and over and I would have liked to see more variety in this sandbox New York like what was available in GTA4. The visuals are good, but nowhere near the levels of GTA4 and Just Cause 2; -if that level was matched this would have been tremendous.  The gore and visuals really sell the creepy tone.\n\nThe item collection gets boring since you only stumble upon them... no hunting possible.

I’m starting to wonder how the major reviewers make their reviews: it seems that most games to receive good reviews are sequels to existing AAA titles, specifically shooters or RTS games. Anyway – back to the recommendation. Prototype is basically what you would get by mixing GTA3 and Spiderman, with a lot more superpowers, with an original but forgettable government-zombie-virus plot. The gameplay is fluid-smooth and the camera is /usually/ pretty good (especially using an XBox 360 controller). Both gameplay and story have a very good pace, and the difficulty is spot-on, where it ramps up but is rarely too easy and uncommonly frustrating. The only issue I had with the game was the repetition in side-missions and a /few/ usless powers; otherwise this is one of my favorite games this year.","August 29, 2011","true","37.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

There's so much to do, so much to collect, so much to... kill. I do wish it had more detailed graphics but I guess it only makes sense since there are literally hundreds of characters on screen sometimes. It plays great with a controller. Consuming enemies just feels so right. I love taking over choppers, running on rooftops, taking over military headquarters. There are no limits. The bossfights are pretty epic, sometimes even hard. Also, there are tons of moves. So many that I don't think a lot of people will even try them all out, or even unlock them. It's a great first game and I can't wait for the second one. But I do hope they'll improve the graphics. And I hope they leave the consume ability fully intact (sounds and the way you have to pull it off).

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Azundris/recommended/10150/","Azundris","Azundris","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Azundris/","247 products in account","The game goes out of its way to give a bad first impression --\nif your graphics card is half decent/recent, the game will get confused and think you can only do ridiculously low resolutions. So you fix that by installing some stuff.\nNext, the sound is ridiculously quiet. So you fix that by installing some stuff.\nThen, the game drops you into a scene with no background or context, which is bad in itself, and the visuals are really pathetic at that point (I think it's because there are many yellow cabs in that scene, and cars are the single most ♥♥♥♥♥-looking things in the game) -- which is misleading, as all in all, the graphics aren't great, but serviceable and quite acceptable for a game of that vintage. Oh yeah, and you can't pick your character, so you're stuck with one who looks like a dork (all of the time) and acts like an ♥♥♥ (half of the time).\n\nSo, the first big challenge then is to make it past the first 30 minutes. After that, it's good fun for a good while. An open world and Awesome Powers(TM) go a long way, and the game is good fun for a good while. Eventually though, the missions get a bit repetitive, and starting about 2/3 into the game, it's usually not the missions that are the problem -- getting to the mission is (travel basically implied the choice of not using powers, in which case you'd get swarmed by zombies, ragdolled by soldiers using rockets and artillery on the zombies, and it would generally take forever, or you'd use your movement powers to speed things up, in which case you'd probably get detected, and take just as long trying to shake off those pesky strike teams. It sounds like a good, "realistic" idea in theory, but in practice, it was nothing more than a nuisance).\n\nThat said, it's not a bad game if you can get it really cheap, but one that overstayed its welcome a bit and would have benefitted from having 1/4 - 1/3 of its playtime cut. (Or, as the more expensive option, have that additional playtime be made more varied and interesting -- something that largely succeeded in Prototype 2.)\n\nPet peeve: The protogonist doesn't have that many voiced lines; he (as well as his sister) has a unisex name, depending on whom you consume you may run around as a woman anyway, and pretty much everybody else calls him "it" anyway (on the grounds that he's an evil infected commie mutant), so their dialogue wouldn't even change. At that point, they might as well have vastly improved the game by giving you a choice of character, at the cost of adding character creation, and a few dozen voiced lines for the protogonist (much more easily so than in P2, for a start, which has more story, and more dialogue -- even so, Saints Row IV, which rips off Prototype mightily, runs circles around both installments in that regard, just like SR3 ran circles around GTA).\n\nSO, DO I NEED TO PLAY THIS FIRST IF I WANT TO PLAY [PROTOTYPE2]?\n\nYou know, I can't say with certainty. While P1 is summarized at the beginning of P2 (incompletely, and colored by the agenda of those doing the summary), you'll need P1 for the full story -- while P2 has a new protoganist, it continues the same story in the same setting, and certain key characters of P1 return. As P1 feels like it has a simpler, slightly less engaging story than P2, with less "story per hour", it's hard to say whether it'll be worth it when you really just want to play P2 and are only playing P1 for the additional background. That said, if the P1/P2 package deal is cheap once again (making P1 £2 or so) and you actually have the time for both, give it a shot -- if you really hate P1 two hours in, you can still fast forward to P2.\n\nTHEREFORE,\n\nQualified recommendation for the B- list P1 (decide whether you can stomach the somewhat retro look), recommendation for the A list P2 (whose only faults are that you have no choice of protagonist, and that it plays a somewhat cliched evil-corporations-and-uncaring-government plot straight, if rather better than P1 did).","January 23, 2015","true","21.9"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","0"

You play as Alex Mercer, an infected, who unlike other infected people turned to a superhuman with extraordinary abilities. You can run, jump at high speed. I almost said you can also climb but that is not true as you simply run on the side of multi-storey buildings. Everything is easily accessible.\n\nYou have the usual action-adventure free roaming concept here: beacons indicate the starting points of missions so once you approach them a cutscene continues the story and your mission begins. Other than that you go wherever you want and whenever you want. And where? In New York. There are recognisable landmarks and as you can guess the map is quite huge - in fact, certain parts are only accessible at a later stage in the story.\n\nThere are many collectibles and you also gather experience points for everything you pick up. This enables you to purchase further upgrades and the stronger you get the more exciting each battle is. Upgrades usually mean a new method of transformation - your arms become tentacles and you can smash or slice everything up. Certain enemy types can only be defeated by certain melee methods so there's variety here and the game is challenging as requires your attention.\n\nThe only issue with Prototype is the places where you are indoors. The ceiling is high up as they want you to be able to jump equally high as outdoors but due to the limited space in the rooms / halls fights are usually difficult in these places. Other than this Prototype is a very interesting, action-driven TPS game that delivers an excellent shape-shifting combat and your protagonist's agility makes free-roaming very exciting.","March 20, 2014","true","27.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/m_friebe/recommended/10150/","m_friebe","m_friebe","http://steamcommunity.com/id/m_friebe/","650 products in account","A fun and challenging game, if you can look past some mildly annoying to very irritating deficits.\n\nFirst, there's the story. It isn't terribly innovative, and it greatly depends on whether the subject matter is your thing. The narrative pretty much consists of the elements "military blackops dealings", "bio-weapon research" and "ugly mutants by way of doomsday virus". I happen to LOVE these tropes. Aside from this, the narrative suffers from a fractured nature and sacrifices character development for spectacle. The latter is to be expected, but Prototype takes it to extremes. Don't expect anything more than cutout labels like "sister", "ex-girlfriend" or "ruthless military leader". Regarding the "fractured" characteristic, there seems to be a strange divide between story cutscenes and gameplay missions, which I can't really explain except for diagnosing a distinct lack of flow. Now, this all may sound pretty negative, but what Prototype does, it does well. The scenario of New York going to pots and turning into a warzone is beautifully realized. The story is also more grounded in reality than, say, Resident Evil, which deals with similar themes. There is also a nice optional gameplay aspect called "Web Of Intrigue", which is for everyone who wants to delve deeper into the world of Prototype. By assimilating certain individuals, you unlock small story snippets connected by a network representing the individuals and their relationships. While this is really cool, there is also potential for future improvement. Why not, for instance, sort these cutscenes by theme and, once you have collected all scenes for a theme, unlock an option to watch a small movie combining the footage into one coherent story?\n\nGameplay-wise, the game is a very fun power fantasy and, at times, exhibits a great flow. Parkouring through New York is exhiliarating, and once you experienced escaping from your exploding helicopter just to hijack the attacking chopper in mid-air, you'll know how great the gamplay can be. HOWEVER, there are two things that made it difficult for me to throroughly enjoy Prototype. The first one are the so-called "Events", which are nothing more than challenges spread over the city. I don't like challenges (or challenge maps, for that matter), as I think they are lazy design choices disconnected from any immersion and only present to shoehorn more content into a game. You like them? Well, great, you can scratch this caveat! Unfortunately, my second gripe transcends individual preferences.\nThis big fun-killer is the atrocious lock-on system (INFO: I played this game with a XBox 360 for Windows Gamepad). There simply doesn't seem to be any logic or prioritizing behind it. It does not really work. Actually, it has no right to do so, as you frequently deal with dozens of enemies simultaneously. But the problem is that the gameplay depends on it. Most of the time, it's just mildly annoying as you have enough time and leisure to rectify any mis-selection. However, during the final act of the game, missions require you to constantly be on your toes and perform difficult tasks under time pressure. You are chasing over the rooftops of Manhattan in desperate pursuit of a chopper you have to stop before it leaves the area? Well, the lock-on doesn't care and prefers to select a tank roaming the streets twenty meters below you. You really, REALLY need to keep track of a powerful boss rampaging through the area so it cannot charge at you like a Chihuahua on meth? The lock-on decides that a common soldier strolling around somewhere requires your immediate attention much more. I can't remember when the controls of a game have infuriated me so much. It renders you and makes you feel helpless.\n\nYet, I recommend Prototype. It features a competently realized and atmospheric scenario, and the gameplay makes even menial work fun. Menial work such as the Events, which can even be circumvented by grinding. However, you should be prepared to get frustrated in the later sections of the game.","June 22, 2015","true","26.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

To be fun. Prototype suceeds.\n\nConsidering release dates, this is the inspiration of Saints Row IV which is my favourite game. This is GTA on cocaine, where you get super powers, can run on walls, float in air and cause massive destruction. Open world yet led by a main mission lane and optional activities.\n\nYou play as Alex Mercer, infected by artificially created shapeshifting virus, you got amnesia and you are the antagonist in a story, your purpose is to find whover created you as such monster, find answers and yes, vengeance. While you are not evil, mass murder of civilians, a.ka. casualties, can happen. The gameplay makes sense in this regard as you get no rewards at all if you kill regular people, only the hostile targets provide points. Also you are hydrophobic.\n\nSounds good?\n\nThere are aspects in which this game is lacking.\n\n1. Forget about running this on max, the optimization for PC is very bad, while the game is playable on medium settings, it will not look as good as it does in the screenshots. Makes you wonder why the hell something with so low requirements should be set to anything other than ultra, yes it is quite aggravating!\n\n2. Controls smell of peasantry. Idiotic auto-target which sometimes take the furthest target, it is a default targeting, to use mouse you have to hold Tab, awkward camera placement, difficulty to turn direction when running, unreliable sprint and stop commands which make accidentally to run up walls or get to places where you did not intend to.\n\n3. Very steep difficulty. The game starts moderate and at one point fights go nuclear. Also the game got a little too much abilities and combos, and some got very strange ways to pull them off, my favourite - uppercut, to do this you have to target enemy with Tab, then go close to it and while moving to direction directly opposite to where enemy goes, hold that movement button and left-click... what the actual ♥♥♥♥?\n\nAt one certain mission there is a bug where helicopters respawn indefinitely no matter how much you kill them making it impossible to fight them, it can be finished by destroying a hive, which I assume is supposed to spawn monsters only.\n\nAlso by playing you will see a lot of RPG rockets flying around, they not only damage you, they also knock you back, interrupting anything you might want to do - like consuming people for health points to sustain the ridiculous damage, enter a vehicle, do a mission activity, and so on while playing on "normal" it requires sharpening concentration and thoughtful placement on super powers to succeed.\n\nWhat is the summary?\n\nA good game just get this only if it is on sale.\n","May 13","true","28.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I mean, your character, Alex Mercer, can transform his arm into a giant blade, a giant hammerfist, huge muscles, a sort of sling whiplash and much more. On top of the sweet combat, the exploration is awesome. Running up skyscrapers, airdashing, and gliding across Manhattan sounds awesome on paper, and plays awesome in the game. The gameplay is clearly where the developers spent the most time, as other areas were lacking.\n\nI know the game was released in 2009, but if I compared it to other games released from 2009, or even 2008, the textures and models are put to shame, even the special effects, i.e; explosions, smoke, water, are kind of bad. There is little reaction in the water when you fall in it, when things blow up, the explosions are weak and not very volumetric, and the smoke within the explosions are unnatural. I'll take back that last one, considering how unnatural the game is, involving a virus that genetically changes people into super monsters.\n\nThe story wasn't bad, but it really wasn't that much to talk about. A lot of military conspiracy, which has been done several times, but at least there were twists in the plot and Alex Mercer, as a protagonist, is awesome and kicks ♥♥♥.\n\nPlay this game for the fun combat and gameplay, maybe for the story, but the graphics are certainly the weakest part.\n\n8.3/10","January 15, 2014","true","16.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This is a very cool game, but full of bugs and glitches in the Steam version. I bought it on sale, and I suggest doing the same thing. Now, let's start with the extended review.\n\nSTORY/GAMEPLAY: This is a sanbox game. very unique in its kind. In spite of being the typical delinquent who wants to rule the mafia, the main character is a human infected by a special virus that allows him to absorb other living beings, and mutate part of his body. There are a great deal of "natural weapons" to use, and also the environment is pretty much destroyable, with the exception of building. The story in my opinion is the shining point of this game, and the funny thing is that it's not explained at all in the beginning, but it's revealet little by little through special events (that last far over the "main story", if you want to collect all pieces of it).\nThe free roaming is quite good. It's cool being this spiderman-like character, and desn't get boring over time.\n\nGRAPHICS: Graphics are average. The main character and the cinematics are quite pretty, but the rest sucks pretty much. There are 10 to 15 "characters" in the game, so the world feels pretty monotonous and dull. The building are quite monotonous too, put together with a little variety. Despite this you can feel some slowdown when there are many enemies on the screen, even if you have a last generation video card.\n\nBUGS: If I understand correctly, this is an xbox/ps porting, so it's full of bugs and glithces. Looking on the internet you can manage to fix pretty much everything, but still sucks having to "open new game > return to main meny > load saved game", or else the game crashes.\n\nAI: Artificial intelligence just sucks. After just a couple of hours of game you can perfectly predict what will happen, even what moves your enemies will do. I think that you can pretty much expect it from a sandbox game, but the overall scarce variety of character is quite dull.\n\nI think that's all. To sum up, this is a short list of pros and cons.\n\nPROs:\n- very good story\n- feels incredibly cool\n- complete it 100% is quite challenging\nCONs:\n- bugs\n- AI\n- graphics (i put in the cons because of the overall effect, and the slowdowns)\n\nThat's all. Hope this review is helpful.","June 18, 2014","true","79.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Although the game is fun, it gets boring after a while. I never got myself to finish it, but I'd still recommend it - when it's on a sale with a considerable discount - it's got a few hours of uncomplicated entertainment in it. Running and jumping across buildings is kind of cool.","November 27, 2013","true","25.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","2"

There's also a ton of extra bits and pieces you can find by seeking out and consuming (more on that later)  certain people, called "Web of Intrigue" targets, and my hat goes off to the people who made those cutscenes, because they looked pretty painful to make. But there are a few sections in the story where you'll be left confused, and with no answers, none. So for the story, 8/10.\n\nThe graphics are a bit dated, but can look pretty good in some parts, especially on the PC. And you'll encounter little to no frame rate issues, or crashes. And the animation is quite nice as well. But there are a few audio glitches, especially in the cutscenes. 7/10\n\nThe gameplay is amazing, it's hack and slash for some parts, and beat them to a bloody pulp for others, and there are so many combos in the game, an astounding ammount. You're also going to want to use a controller if one is handy, I felt the game didn't work well for a keyboard, and was glad I had my controller with me. But consuming is really quite interesting, you can grab a target and more or less "eat" them, but you gain their form, memories, etc. etc. etc. But the boss battles felt painfully OP, and I was playing on normal for my first time through. I had the most trouble with the last boss, as he was a damage sponge, there were other people attacking me, and if that's not enough, there's a timer. His attacks also did an insane ammount of damage. Gameplay earns a solid 9/10\n\nSo, the story is great, one of the best one's I've experienced in a while, close to the level that the original inFAMOUS gave you in terms of depth. Still, it has verry odd bits and pieces missing from it that could of easily been included. Graphics could of been better (i.e. inFAMOUS was released around the same time, and look at how it looked) and the gameplay is awesome. So my final score for [PROTOTYPE] is an 8/10, pick this game up, it is a must have.","November 14, 2014","true","29.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/shootyaindaback/recommended/10150/","shootyaindaback","UncleSniper","http://steamcommunity.com/id/shootyaindaback/","108 products in account","This game is a prime example of what happens when people that think game consoles were a good idea try to develop video games. Apart from the usual UI horrors (lengthy, yet unskippable "presented by" sequence at every start, "do not turn off power while the game is saving" notice at every start, extremely inaccurate mouse tracking, etc.), the aspect ratio is messed up (huge black borders; I've seen others complain about this on the forums, so it seems it isn't just me), the controls are clearly geared towards (gag) gamepads and the list goes on with all the classic nonsense that happens when a game is developed for consoles and then back-ported to PC.\n\nWhat really tipped the balance is the fact that the performance is completely ruined by what, judging from what I read on the forums, is likely some severe issue with detecting the controls. After having spent days getting Final Fantasy XIII (which exhibits a similar issue) to run halfway decently, I frankly can't be <kinsoku jikou>ed to find a series of hacks just to circumvent this ridiculous performance hit. Even on a state-of-the-art PC that runs all other (properly developed!) games smoothly on high quality settings, this game can only be described as "unplayable" on PC. While there might or might not be ways to fix this up (apparently involving downloading hacked versions of game DLLs from shady one click hoster sites -- DO NOT DO THIS, you'll be inviting viruses, trojans and whatnot onto your system!), it can only be said that the average Joe (as in, somebody that isn't a computer expert) would have little chance to get this game to work properly (without blindly following quite dangerous instructions off the internet, anyway, cf. the bit about the modified DLLs).\n\nOn a more technical note, apparently there is a cap on the amount of video memory and exceeding this cap restricts the quality settings severly. The very fact that this cap is 2 GB rather than 4 GB (i.e. the so-called engine uses a signed integer to represent memory size) is quite indicative of whoever wrote this game not knowing anywhere near enough about programming to even think about making video games. I'm sorry, and this is not supposed to be flame bait, nor an insult, nor to be taken personally, but the preceding is simply a fact.\n\nBottom line: Unplayable on PC; cannot, in good conscience, recommend.","April 7","false","0.1"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","44","4","9","0","0"

You tend to punch instead of using your claws as well.\n\n4. Combat is lame\nCollecting genetic materials was so lame. You are basically running around a zone collecting shiny bubbles.

The camera is done perfectly and the controls are great.\n\nYour character's super powers are a mix of Spawn, Venom, and the Incredible Hulk, all at the same time and in concert. One errant swipe from one of your several melee weapons will completely eviscerate someone, causing onlookers to beg for their lives, spontaneously vomit, and instantly lose their sanity forever. One purposeful swipe will dismember a crowd of people. Simply wading through crowds and annihilating defenseless people becomes like a work of art, since there are so many ways to do it. If you get bored of using super powers, jump in a tank or helicopter (it's very easy) and crush everything.

I would try to explain the plot further, but I honestly can’t. The volume drops inexplicity to whispers in all of the game’s cutscenes - it’s as if the voice actors themselves are embarrassed at taking part in this travesty.\n\nYou’ll battle the government and the plague monsters infecting an island that looks as if someone attempted to draw Manhattan without ever having been there - or even Googled it to see what it looks like. Fortunately, you’ll have a lot of cool powers at your disposal to help you. Unfortunately, thanks to Prototype’s overly complicated control system, you won’t figure how out how to use half of them. It doesn’t help that, despite Alex’s ability to hijack a helicopter in midair and bodyslam a tank, he can’t properly block. This becomes a problem as the creators of this game think that the way to make Prototype’s later missions be more challenging is for them to simply throw thousands of enemies at your face. The longer the game goes the more frustrating it becomes.\n\nUltimately, Prototype can be a fun way to spend a few hours, but you’ll quickly question why you keep playing it.","May 14","false","17.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I remember trying to play it on console and never really gave it a chance then, but where I've made the leap to PC, I decided to give this game a shot again and I absolutely love it! It's an acquirred taste for some, but anyone looking for a super-powered antihero to spice things up should definitely try this out. I recommend using an ENB with this game to boost it's graphic quality ever so slightly. I'm usually not stingy about graphics, but Prototype definitely has a dated look in some areas. It gives the world depth and atmosphere to the mix. Some animations are a bit jerky and fidgity, making movement and flow a bit awkward at times, but when sprinting through obstacles, you'll start to get used to them.\n\nFor those who've played Radical Entertainment's previous title, Hulk: Ultimate Desctruction, you'll find a lot of the mechancics very siimilar to that game. You're able to upgrade Alex Mercer's abilities to become the ultimate biological weapon the human race has ever seen. As his powers grow, so does the infection that's plagued all of Manhattan Island, and the shady military branch, known as Blackwatch, are to take extreme measures to ensure the infection is contained and irradicated at all costs. Mercer's goal is to find the individuals responsible for his shapeshifting powers. making sure they never repeat the atrocities they've committed to not only him, but the lives of others as well.","May 27","true","46.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Find the people who’ve done that to you and make them pay.\nThe game -action, adventure, open worldish- sounded fun and looked fun, and I was very hyped to play it. I was also very disappointed when I finally did. Controls, though a bit wonky, are not difficult. You can change your body “at will” to attack enemies and destroy things, and when I say “at will” I mean you only have so many things you can change into. I think the most fun aspect of the game is the fact that you can ‘consume’ random people and then turn into them, and run/jump your way around pretty freely.\n\nI’d say the graphics are dated, but it’s an oldish game, so it gets a slight pass for that. What it doesn’t get a pass for, however, is the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ performance. For a 2009 game that should run like a charm on my computer, it sure worked like crap even at the lowest settings, lagging worse than Assassin’s Creed III - and at least that one had a reason to lag (no “low” video settings, hey). I’m also not particularly fond of the reddish/orangeish filter they use on later cinematics and gameplay time, I find it bothersome to look at.\n\nYour character is overpowered, which is not bad in itself if you like an easy game, but it does make things boring after a while as it’s all the same; to tell the truth, it reminded me a little of God Hand for some reason, only that one was actually fun to keep playing. With Prototype, I did the first few missions and was bored out of my mind - that along with the slightly eye-hurting graphics and slight, random spikes of lag made the game truly disappointing.\nThe gameplay is pretty repetitive otherwise. Fight a bunch of bad guys, have them call in tanks and an airstrike, be chased, shake them off, rinse and repeat with a moderate variety of enemies and mutants to fight against.\n\nIt’s not a completely unplayable game, mind you. If you’re extremely bored and want to play something that doesn’t pose a huge challenge, it’s not a bad game and could even be considered entertaining. I liked the city, the chance to explore it some, the general idea of the game was good (though the story was a bit hit and miss with me), but the execution left a lot to be desired.\nPerhaps if the game had lagged a bit less I would have enjoyed it a bit better.\n\nI wouldn’t recommend this game, but I would certainly not tell you to steer clear from it either, as I feel it could be a lot more fun if you can actually play it sans the lag.","August 2, 2015","false","0.8"," 7 of 16 people (44%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","44","7","16","3","3"

Every task feels samey, the enemies are boring, and the acting feels like it did before anybody with any decent acting ability would voice characters in a game. I find it impossible to care about anything that happens.\n\nDespite all that, if this game actually had come out for the PS2, or for the PC at the same time as, say, Star Wars Battlefront, it would have been amazing. I would have loved it, and I would have played it for hours on end. Now, however, it's just filled with that sense of disappointment you get when you go to play a game from your childhood that you loved (GTA3, for example) and it's just terrible by today's standards.\n\nFor a better super-jumping, punch-exploding open-world experience pick up Saints Row IV when it's on sale.

That the dev's haven't even bothered to attempt to fix. The games resolution will be stuck at a max of 1280x800. In order to get around this, you have to do a ton of messing around with files (potentially downloading a .dll file to replace theirs, so that you can get a full 1080p resolution.) There are some simpler solutions, that have worked for some people. (Lucky them.) They haven't worked for me yet. I haven't even succesfully gotten the game to work yet. I shouldn't have to spend this amount of time to get it to work though. Especially when I paid for the game.\n\nThis will stay a "NOT RECCOMENDED" review, until someone fixes this bug.

I thought the game was quite forgiving, and I was so so wrong...\n\nright after getting in and watching a cutscene I am told to lead these big tanky infested zombie things to a military base.\nand they one of THE most rage inducing stupid enemy designs ever!\n\nthey can run faster then you, chuck stuff at you with perfect aim and worst of all their close combat attacks track you. its like they have hacked aimbot into their fists!!\n\nsure you can doge them if you run around like a mad man like i did, but to really hurt them you need to hit them with close combat combos, and when you do they just go "NOPE F*CK YOU!!" and interrupt it with an attack that is faster than yours.\n\nthen they stunlock you until you are nearly dead. so the game ever so helpfully recommends that you kill them for more health. you could always try to kill other things for more health like enemy soldiers but they like to focus on you and only you.\n\nso when you do try that they beat the sh*t out of you until have have as little health as you started with.\n\n\nbut the mission... oh the mission you fight them on is so much worse...\n\nfirst 3 of them come in and you have to kill them all, then 8 more after that and 10 more after that!\n\nall the while alex mecer (main guy of the story. the one you play as) is saying stuff like "bring more! ill kill them all!" and "i could take on a 100 more!" NO YOU CANOT YOU STUPID LITTLE BABY! NOW SHUT UP!!\n\nso then after running around in circles like a mad man while the miltary shoots them like I did, or you somehow mange to  kill them by yourself (in that case I am in awe of you!) you are told to blow up a bunch of fuel tanks to kill the stunlockers of doom, by using the rocket launchers and granade launchers that are impossible to aim, while somehow not getting stonlocked to death.\n\nonce you do that it triggers a cutscene were the zombie monsters are killed by the explosions.\n\nonly moments before they were face tanking 12 rockets at once!! so the fuel tanks explode the monsters die, and alex mercer stands right there as the ENTIRE BUILDING FALLS ON HIM!! without taking a scratch when ingame rockets do hurt him!!\n\nthe players reward for all that? a smug c*cky grin from alex mercer and bullets in your face as more soldiers shoot you right afterwoods.\n\njust die already you stupid game and stupid baby face alex mecer!\n\n3/10 already anyoing issues, game crashes for some,it won't even start for others and controller breaking frustration.","May 2, 2015","false","4.3"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","33","3","9","3","0"

The games protagonist Alex Mercer is an unrepentant sociopath and embodies the Prototype worldview. Mercers obsession with vengeance leads him into mass murder, which in turn makes it impossible to root for him. He actually uses civilians as "medi kits", absorbing their bodies to replenish health. One of the primary quest givers is Mercers sister, and not killing her seems to be Mercers most humane act.\n\nIn fiction, the most obvious way to justify the anti-hero's acts is to make the villains even more evil in comparison. Prototype is not afraid of the obvious, and the military and the private sector seem to be psychopaths to the last man.\n\nThe gameplay is OK but unspectacular, with Mercer having access to various powers but gaining upgrades at a very fast speed indeed. The speed of Mercers movements is very fast too, and going from place to place is actually well made. The typical activities (obstacle courses, kill challenges etc.) do not fit the game, at all.\n\nPrototype is nasty and nihilistic and I cannot recommend it to anyone. Prototype fans were somewhat disappointed when Mercer returned as the primary villain in 2, but that is what he was all along.","August 3, 2013","false","11.4"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","1"

They need to run at 60 frames per second on 60 Hertz to have smooth motion, were it not for the insane amounts of stuttering. This stuttering looks very much like an extremely severe case of microstutter, yet I only run a single GPU setup (1 x GTX 780 TI).\n\n2. Running the games beyond 60 fps (either through disabling the vsync or running at higher Hz) make them look like a 30 fps game. It looks like the engine repeats every frame even though any framerate counter will state that the games run smoothly at any Hz rate the monitor is set. (eg. 100 fps on a 100 Hz display, but it looks exactly like running a constant 50 fps on 100 Hz.)\n\nBoth engine faults give me a headache when I try to play the games.\n\nI've tried every "fix" I could find on the internet (including disabling all HID devices, running at the lowest in-game graphics settings, adding command line parameters, setting processor affinity, using the resolution fix .dll, etc.) and none worked for me.\n\nSo I know this isn't much of a review of the game itself. It might be good, but I never got to experience it myself because of these technical issues which I admit being sensitive to. Therefore, I can hardly recommend the game, now can I? I did, after all, not have a fun time playing this game.\n\nAs such I feel I need to not recommend it. You might not have issues with it however, so keep that in mind. Yet, I still wanted to write these words of warning to those few people who might have issues with this game if smooth motion is kind of a must for them, or to those who loathe bad PC ports in general.","December 30, 2014","false","0.9"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","2","8","0","1"

Unfortunately, immediately after that it takes away every single one of your fun toys and makes you start over with absolutely nothing. "Here, go play a completely different game that isn't any fun at all instead for several hours and earn the right to have fun again," it says. I slowly started unlocking some of the neat things I'd enjoyed playing with in the tutorial, and it got a bit better, but it was too little too slowly, and I got bored five hours in before it was able to recapture that initial excitement.\n\nFor random comparison's sake, it feels a lot like a single-player version of DCUO to me, only with  tighter controls and a much less interesting, less colorful world, with a fairly bland story and unlikable characters. The gameplay probably would've been enough to save it if it hadn't completely turned me off by taking away all my fun I was having.","December 5, 2012","false","5.1"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","1"

At first the game delivers a very fun feeling in the introduction. After that you're stripped of all your power and made to play out Alex Mercer's story. The story seems interesting enough that might make me want to go back and play this game.\n\nWhat truly turned me off about this game was the combat system. Holy ♥♥♥♥ the combat is more clunky then 1980's T1100. When trying to pick up firearms from dead enemies you better get ready to press that button over and over (so help you god if you have an enemy near you and you end up grabbing him instead). Also, the first hunter encounter, oh god..... is that suppose to be a challenge? That isn't a challenge, that's just annoying. The targeting system is counter-intuitive at best, "Oh let me target the guy in front....aaaaand I targeted the tank behind me). I want to enjoy this game, but holy ♥♥♥♥ I think I have to either get high turn or just tune it down to easy and faceroll it. (I really don't want to do that)\n\nP.S.

If thats what you're looking for then buy this game!  If you prefer a story behind your squishing, or a story with a hero you can relate to in some way, or ANYTHING else to go along with your squishing, DONT buy this game.  You wont be happy.

Twitchy camera that loves to jerky around, making it tough to  track your targets. Weird sound bugs that cut in and out during the "story" segments, which mean you can't understand what's being said; very annoying. I completed the game, so my total is about it for length, unless you want to do all the side missions, which are even more boring and repetitive then the main story; add a few more hours if you do.  Combat is fun for a bit, but the game loves to spawn stuff in the moment your back is turned, literally, which kind of makes it pointless after you shred your 10th helicopter in a row. The only way to end it is to fly away, where they lose interest in 10 seconds, after you killed 100s of their men. Also, the combat take a dive towards the end when you fight the super solders; QRTs every time you fight these guys, and if you miss it, it will really hurt. On top of everything else coming at you (there is ALOT), these guys really ruin the flow of the combat, only way to beat them beyond shoot/throwing stuff at them is the QFT; pretty bad in a game where free flow combat is the main draw. Additionally, weapon balance is poor, why use anything else after you get the sword? Yea, unless you looking for absolutely mindless slaughter, and can tolerate the camera, you should probably pass.","December 7, 2014","false","14.9"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","0"

Ripping and tearing apart innocent citizens and soldiers alike, destroying everything, ellbow-slamming a tank - there will be gore and explosions everywhere. Sounds decent, right?\n\nA little.\n\nOnly problem is the controls where a bit clunky (even on the PS3) and I had massive problems focussing and attacking the enemy I actually wanted. Another funbreaker is the fact that you're easily being bounced back, even by small and weak enemies. It's even worse when stronger enemies and helicopters chase you. Sometimes you're feeling like a ball in a pinball machine.\n\nThis game has so much potential and with proper implementation this propably would have been the best anti-aggression-game and there is. I mean, you have all those amazing powers! From disguise to running at super speed to hammerfists (lets you smash tanks), clawhands (rips and tears everything apart), whiplash (for taking down distant enemies), superjumping, semi-flying (gliding). You can even throw buses into helicopters and stuff, the list goes on and it's awesome.\n\nBut you're almost not able to live it up.\n\nThe story is ok and acceptable. The missions are way too hard and not fun at all (I'm not a good gamer, though). In one mission you have to flee. Excuse me? I'm a godlike creature and can destroy a tank with a single blow with my ellbow, why the heck should I flee?\n\nThat's boring and uninspiring. It's like getting a Lamborghini in a racing game and the game tells you to drive not faster than 30 miles per hour. Unfortunately, I didn't find any cheats or mods for this game. I think with a little effort like removing all the time based missions and the bouncing this would be just awesome.\n\nIf you can get this game for a decent price (it's under 10 dollars mostly, on Humble Bundle even cheaper) and if you do like gore, GO GET IT and happy ripping and tearing bodies apart for a while.  I really hope you could do an devastator attack on some people out there who are wasting so much potential.

The main character has some super fun super powers that allow you to do some really crazy things as you fly, jump, or run (horizontally and vertically) through the city.The game also looks pretty good.  The story seems really fascinating as well, but that's about where the good ends.\n\nFirst off, the city gets pretty boring pretty quickly as there is nothing really unique about the city that makes any part of the city look any different from another part.  I found myself just following the quest markers on the mini map and not trying to learn the city at all.  I never knew where I was unless I pulled up the main map.  There are lots of cool powers, but when the fights get going you are so busy running around trying to stay alive and kill that you never really get any time to really bask in the fun of watching a cool ability when it is triggered.\n\nThe main negative is that it appears that the controls for the PC port didn't translate properly.  The keyboard presses are super sensitive.  I've been using this keyboard for a few years and dozens of games, so I am comfortable with it, but I never had such problems with the keyboard in any other game than I did with Prototype.  To top it off there was no sweetspot for mouse sensitivity either.  Either it took HUGE hand sweeps to turn left and right, with the mouse, or my camera would go sitr crazy at the slightest twitch when trying to adjust the sensitivity.  Also y-axis sensitivity was way more sensitive than the x-axis.\n\nAs a result, I could barely control my character as I bounced off walls, hitting things, or attacking things except the actual mob I had selected as my target.  My character looked cool going bat crap crazy all over the fight zone, but if this game had been real life, the people I was fighting would have thought I was an idiot as they easily gunned me down, which is what happened during game play very often.  I eventually got so ultra ♥♥♥♥♥♥ at the lack of character control that I finally quit and removed the game from my system.  Experiencing the story wasn't enough of a draw to make me spend many frustrating hours getting killed constantly and wander through a boring city.

It makes some missions extremely frustrating.\n\nTry Saints Row 4 instead. It has taken the super powers from Prototype but removed the frustrating parts of the gameplay.","January 17, 2015","false","11.0"," 2 of 9 people (22%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","22","2","9","0","0"

There's no chance I'll be playing through all of this again anytime soon.\n\nHere's the main issues I had with what would be an otherwise fun and enjoyable game:\n\n• Shadows are completely nonexistent for those who have AMD graphic cards.\n\n• It's impossible to continue without having the game crash. In order to fix this you need to start a new game with a new save, quit back to the main menu after the first cutscene, and then load your original save file. This is where I got confused, after not playing for so long, and managed to save over my old file.\n\n• The volume in this game is extremely low. I play with headphones, for almost every game I'll usually set the volume to around 40% through the little controller on my headset. I find it hard to hear at 100% with PROTOTYPE, there's no other way to increase the volume.\n\nThere are no fixes for these issues, there's no FOV slider which would help with how claustrophobic the screen is. The developer went bankrupt and no one gives a ♥♥♥♥ about the people who bought this in such a broken state, so I insist you not waste your time and money or you'll only end up as frustrated as I am right now.","May 17, 2013","false","7.2"," 4 of 14 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","4","14","0","0"

The camera and the targetting are on the same stick so you will constantly find yourself in situations where you have to choose between panning the camera or getting a lock on something - only to have that target switch to yet another unlabeled target whether you have line of sight or not. You'll be ragdolled out of maneuvers constantly. This includes "consuming" people to restore your health. This means you'll grab someone, start to eat them and have the animation interrupted by one of the dozen (at least) incoming attacks. Maybe it's a bulky melee hunter, maybe it's splash damage from the thirty-five missles and tank rounds, doesn't matter. Trying to restore health anywhere near an active battle (and the battle will follow you around corners, onto rooftops, and also see through your disguise instantly once the Super Soldiers enter the fight) is literally setting yourself up to be mauled.

Who doesn't dream of having super powers?  Being able to run, jump, and glide across city blocks in the blink of an eye is quite the rush.  On top of that, being able to shapeshift at will (as a disguise or to transform your body into devestating weaponry).\n\nThe problem for me is after about 10 hours of playtime, why am I struggling to find the will to continue playing?\n\nThere's a story, but it feels like a narrative that I'm unlocking rather than experiencing.  It's completly mission-based.  The game quickly turns into a free-roam-the-city-to-start-x-event.  To become more powerful I destroy and kill everything.  To complete missions I destroy and kill.  To learn more about the story... destroy and kill.  Let me put it another way... you get reports on how many kills you get and how much money you cost the military, and the higher these numbers are the better your score is.\n\nI could really only reccomend this game to people who:\na.

The infected citizens turning the population into mutants.\nThe main story path is entirely linear. The missions are a sloppy mix of poorly paced ideas. Long missions involve simply going from one end of Manhattan to the other, while some of the short missions are climactic sieges and battles. Missions can be brutally challenging, often because of the uncooperative auto-lock system. Boss battles are much longer than they need to be and more often test your endurance rather than your skill.\nAs you work your way through the game, you will earn experience points that can be used to unlock new and ever more exotic powers.

I found the sound messed up really hard so I could barely hear the dialogue when there was any.  It didn't stop me from understanding the story, but it did ♥♥♥♥ me off.  The story is boring.  It's a typical amnesiac with super powers trying to figure out the past.  I liked it better when it was the Bourn Identity.\n\nGameplay started out funny but immediately got stale.  I really don't care for stealth missions and I didn't see a need for them in this game, but it went ahead & gave me stealth missions anyway.  The whole thing felt poorly balanced.  You're this super ultra killing machine and there's always a seemingly infinite number of soldiers on the screen all spread out shooting at you at all times and you're trying to kill enough guys to keep regenerating health.  Then they introduce these mutant alien things that take for god damn ever to kill.  I got really tired of fighting those things after about the 28th time.\n\nYou can steal vehicles, but it wasn't really adding anything to the gameplay.  About 8 or so missions in, I just got bored of the game and decided this wasn't worth finishing.  I was on normal and I started out laughing like "hahaha this is so easy" to having a heart attack trying to finish a mission.  I get that there were more super powers to upgrade, they seemed mostly useless from the description.  The novelty of the game wears off after about half an hour or so.

It is worth it to dig into their problems to ensure that you will not have them as well.\n\nThat having been said, graphically, this game is nothing special (though to its credit, it is half a decade old at this point), and the controls can be a bit difficult at times. But overall, I do recommend this game. it is a fun game to just unleash h*ll on random civies (as there are no penalties for it). The powers are very fun, and when you get used to the controls, zipping around the city is pretty fantastic. The story is nothing too special, but still fun to go through. And some of the missions can be a bit annoying on higher difficulties.\n\nBasically, this game is a fantastic ammoral d*ck simulator, and well worth the low cost imho. You can just run around streets with a car over your head, smashing everyone like bowling pins. You can go nuts with machine guns or helicopters. Quite frankly, this is a great sandbox game to play, even if it does seem to lack depth in most departments (although they do have a cool feature where you can affect the map through your actions, even if it is temporary)\n\n8.5/10","December 7, 2014","true","10.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The plot is relatively unorigional with the whole disease strikes a city, city goes under siege, gunfire, people die, we're all having fun here. The storytelling is so bad that there's a freaking set of side missions specifically there to find little clippets of whatever is going on here (it becomes clear at the end, but the ending and the plot in the main storyline make the game feel kind of pointless) and don't even get me started on the voice acting. As fun as it is listening to Alex Mercer go on about how he needs to find some answers over and over again is, I'd much rather gouge my eardrums out with a grapefruit spoon. (or just play it on mute. that works too...)\n\nThat being said, the only solace that makes up for the rest of the pile of unspeakable that is this game, is the fact that the power curve is flawless. Something about running down a new york street at 40 mph, vaulting over cars and trucks alike, then jumping and clearing a 30 story building just to start running up the side of the empire state building, doing a flying leap off, and bullet diving into the earth so hard that the entire black turns to shambles is entertining, if not extremely satisfying.

Many cheap deaths as well from enemies you couldn’t see doing huge attacks. Also the lock-on system is garbage since it only shows priority targets one should remove first rather then what the player wants to target.\nAll that said the game is good. The different attack styles one can use to kill enemies are really visceral. But what I will praise to the end is the movement system. If you play this game you will feel absolute joy just running amok on Manhattan Isle, mainly just running around like a mad Sonic the hedgehog killing NPCs as you please.\nI will say now I haven’t finished the final boss battle. The last segment of the battle is timed and because the timers are lowered on the PC version you won’t have enough time to actually finish it.\nSo get the console versions: either the Xbox 360 or the PS3 version. The PC I don’t recommend either way. But it’s worth experiencing the pleasure of the movement system alone for the game.","July 19, 2014","true","33.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/RunningShovel/recommended/10150/","RunningShovel","Shovel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/RunningShovel/","231 products in account","The chief theme here will be broad strokes, which is what Prototype has. It's got the framework of a bunch of cool stuff, and it works to an extent, but there's ample room for improvement in everything. Take for example, the movement. You can climb and jump around most anything, and going in a single direction feels awesome most of the time, you can glide and dash and leap to your heart's content. But, if you're trying to get a tricky collectable from atop an antenna or building, Alex will often tweak out and flip over and around everything in sight, and it's quite a job to wrestle him into precise movements. Want to turn left or right? Hope you've got a few seconds cause unstoppable forces don't turn on a dime. Another example: Do you hate collateral damage? Don't even, cause there is nothing you have that won't wipe out a 90 degree arc about 10 feet in front of you at least. You're going to be smashing civvies and other innocents all the time, and the game gives you a nice running total of how many families you've ruined after each fight, so good luck sleeping I guess.\n\nThe actual in-game storyline is, nyeh? It's okay, it gives me an excuse to destroy all this junk, and it joins up all these events just fine. There were a couple of standout moments, but ultimately it was pretty by the numbers. It does tend to wrench control out of your hands to show you things during missions, or straight up transport you across the map afterwards, which can be annoying. The Web Of Intrigue though? That's some good stuff right there, loads of dropped hints and filling in the gaps, much speculation and other really cool junk. I spent ages just cruising the city looking for targets cause they were so interesting. Word of advice though, never skip a target movie, cause good luck remembering the name and then finding it in the hundred-something strong web.\n\nCombat: Losing relies chiefly on some very dubious things: Unavoidable chip damage, homing attacks, and super-damaging stunlocks. It's not that it's not challenging, cause you will die if you're not paying attention, but it's really going through the motions of action/reaction to the above three. Some cooped-in boss battles can make the game feel hard, and especially early in the game when you're not very powerful. Oftentimes you'll find yourself cheesing fights by staying on the move and chipping at stronger foes from range, because moving in for actual damage provides them with too many opportunities to stun/grab/hit you and it's not worth the risk. It makes fights more of a chore than fun sometimes, and that's not so great. Health is relatively easy to come by, by grabbing and eating mooks, but it makes every mistake another chore, since everything big hurts you so much you'll have to find and consume 2-3 of the little guys safely before you can re-engage. It skews the pacing and atmosphere of fights quite a bit, and it's often more advantageous to just bug out. Unless, of course, you're doing a scripted story mission or event that requires you to clear an area, in which case hunker down for the long haul. The AI isn't very smart, not at all, but they are numerous and widespread. It's not about outsmarting them, it's about outsmarting the group and learning to play the way they work to your advantage. Stealth isn't, really, but it does what it needs to and works within the larger framework. Many of the stronger enemies are niusances rather than challenges, but again you gain the powers to gib them or to lose them fairly early on, so it's not really too big of a deal.\n\nSpeaking of powers, those are pretty cool. You get a bunch of different arms, some defensive stuff, some supports, and they all have a use. You'll probably find yourself favouring one or two though, since there's quite a bit of redundancy between them. I'd have liked to see some more differentiation, but only a small fraction are mandatory so I guess not having everything must be allowed for. There's lots of stuff to spend your money on, special moves for each power as well as ones for plain old fisticuffs, movement and health upgrades, super moves, the store really does overflow with stuff. The movement too, once you figure out how to do it right, it's a joy to traverse the city and the challenges become simple matters of route rather than speed. You can fly and dash and grab walls and leap and dive, there really are a lot of things you can do and that's great. Also, when you enter the power radial selection everything slows down for a second to let you pick, and that's awesome.\n\nWhile it's not perfect, Prototype has one excellent quality: Not many other games make you feel this powerful, this badass, all of the time. You have a couple of dozen ways to destroy the dude that's ineffectually pinging at you with his rifle, and you have so much health that you can afford to decide. If he brings ten friends, it still doesn't really matter cause you can just nab one and chuck him at the others and then elbow drop the rest before zipping up a building and being five blocks away before backup even thinks of arriving. If some tougher guys decide to chase you, you're stronger and faster than them so just hit them with a ventilation unit and disappear, because you can. It broaches on God Game territory sometimes, but you're running around on the ground being all-powerful, and that feels really good.\n\n+\nFun as all hell\nOodles of powers and upgrades\nFeels godlike, man\nOptions, options, options\n\n-\nPoor PC controls\nCombat can be cheap at times\nShowing it's age graphically\n\nIn the end, Prototype was worth the time I put into it, and despite the above tirade, the good outweighs the bad. Much of it is just frustration about what could have been great but ended up being just good. But, that still leaves you with a good, fun game, with tons of things to do and stuff to see, and a lot of extra storyline junk for those interested.","July 24, 2014","true","31.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The gameplay involves the use of superpowers, basic vahicle mechanics and guns, which - excepting the guns - all work pretty well. The powers you gain along the course of the game are, as they should be, much better than the ones you get in the first 30 minutes, with things like the extendo-tentecale and blade basically rendering everything else obselete, so the game progresses fairly well.

You run about eating people, things, things that used to be people etc, while rapidly evolving to become more powerful and gain the memories you've lost. The gameplay involves the use of superpowers, basic vahicle mechanics and guns, which - excepting the guns - all work pretty well. The powers you gain along the course of the game are, as they should be, much better than the ones you get in the first 30 minutes, with things like the extendo-tentecale and blade basically rendering everything else obselete, so the game progresses fairly well.  Overall it's pretty great game, although other hack and slashers have bested it I still hold firm to the fact that I've believed since it's release, in that it's probably the best superpowers based game ever.","September 13, 2014","true","33.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I keep getting fooled by EA games. It's a fun premise, with lots of other people giving it great reviews.\n\nSome obvious short comings is resolution is capped at 720p, and cut scene audio isn't ported out correctly (you can change the latency in which audio comes in, which means unsynced audio/audio plays faster than the video in cut scenes). It's pretty bad, even for a 5 year old game - EA always does ports, and they've always turned out unpolished.\n\nMaximum AA is 2x, and in all honesty, the graphics are horrendous for a 2009 game. This looks like it was based on the first generation half life engine.\n\nAll in all tho, the story has potential, as well as the game play (game play/controls/movement is not fluid), and the beginning tutorial is kind of useless as... you have to redo another tutorial anyways. The biggest appeal to me, is like all the other reviewers said - you are an over powered beast capable of rampaging through everywhere. The terrible port of cutscenes detracts from the otherwise good story line, and the controls are pretty bad (eg: i'm standing over a gun, I press the "grab" button, and he lunges in the air hoping to grapple a non-existent target instead of the gun he's standing on top of. Problem is, his lunge moves him forward, meaning i have to reposition him per failed grab. Ugh)\n\nI don't recommend this EA port of a game, at all.

It's a mess of an experience and tries to pad itself with missions that require you to repeat activities or run across the world just to show off the fact you can fly about with gore shoowing out of your wrists. Mercer is completely unsympathetic, and the story collapses on itself when you think about it for more than five seconds.\n\nBut it's fun. There's something primal about dropping down into a group of twenty soldiers and just tearing them apart before devouring their commander so you can call down artillery on their heads. It's ultimately ironic when they give you all these powers and upgrades, it's impossible to use nearly any of them because of how predators hunt you down and rockets home in on your location. Often missions devolve into hiding behind buildings, eating civs and waiting for a chance to rush back in and deal a littel damage. The bosses are definitely the low part of the game; they are all immune to even your basic attacks and it comes down to cheesing your way to victory.\n\nGlad I played it, because it really helps me appreciate where games have come from and where they are going.

I don't want to spend an hour doing the same repetitive pop in, blow something up. run away, fight off 10 helicopters, go stealthy, start over thing with every damn task in the game.  it just stops being fun. when the game glitched at the end and I can't get past a specific cut scene, I simply gave up.  It's not even worth even finding out what the ending is, because the game is so frustrating and repetitive.  I don't say this often, but I just didn't this game that much.

This game has it all.\nThe only issue I have with it is the sheer amount of useless upgrades in the "combat" section.\nYou can buy an upgrade to slam your fists together and stun nearby enemies, or you can buy an upgrade to slam your fists on the ground and stun nearby enemies. Both have pretty much the same effect, there's no reason to buy both.\nThere's also an upgrade for a pointless palm slam and an uppercut with an air-combo followup you never get to use because the uppercut only launches humans but also kills most of them in one hit, which goes against the point of launching them in the first place.\nSo basically, where there should've been a shield upgrade and something to make the claws and the hammerfists not useless after you get the blade, they came up with four different shockwave jump attacks. Where there should've been an upgrade to hold multiple disguises, they came up with an upgrade to accuse someone of being you. Where there should've been a sprint-consume upgrade, they came up with a cannonball attack.\nAnyway, this game is really fun if you don't spend hours getting EXP for Kung Fu moves you'll never use.","May 17, 2015","true","23.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It deficiencies in quality graphics are more than made up by the ground breaking world design and ai for its time. What feels like a hundred different cars, zombies, soldiers, and civilians in an ever changing map runs very smoothly. Now this isn't much for the standard computer now, but just how all these actors interact is astounding. Cars will swerve away from zombies and have car crashes while helicopters swoop by over head and the distant gunfire of a soldier can be heard.

The game's highest resolution setting is 720p, and the graphics certainly aren't very impressive for a 2009 PC game. InFAMOUS looks better on PS3 really, and it came out at the exact same time. I played this game with a controller, so I can not tell you if the mouse and keyboard controls work well. The controls with a controller are alright. They aren't as precise as I'd like, but their good enough to keep the gameplay enjoyable. I experienced a couple crashes, but the game was fairly stable overall.\nThe gameplay is better than the port and is a nice bit of mindless fun. You can slice, throw, crush, and consume people by the dozen. The homicidal maniac within the player will have a blast butchering helpless soldiers for quite a while. However, eventually your inner homicidal maniac will realize there's nothing else to do but kill kill kill, and he or she will begin to grow tired of the indiscriminate mass murder. You'll probably reach this point before you finish the game, especially after half the enemies become super soldiers, large mutants, tanks, and various other enemies that will knock you about stunning you constantly and throwing you around like a baseball among a group of American children. Getting around the city is quite enjoyable. There's just something satisfying about jumping 50 feet into the air and gliding around New York, but this also begins getting old with time.\nThe story is forgetable, but if you're buying a game where you play as a superpowered mass murderer for story, then you're clearly looking in the wrong place.\nThis game fills a good few hours with hack and slash joy, but outstays its welcome. I'd recommend you get it on sale.","May 25, 2014","true","23.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Pretty fun game when you are running around just blowing stuff up; but once you get down to doing some of the missions (aka the actual game) things go down hill quickly.  It is fun to just run around the city roaming around killing people but the missions really restrict things which is pretty unnecessary.  You are supposed to be some badass yet even a single enemy can pretty much kill you because the way the combat is designed you have to dodge everything with no option to block so basically if you get hit you are going to keep getting hit, and then you get hit into a corner, then you get beaten to death by giant mutant things.  Is the game worth buying though?  Sure if you get it for like 5 bucks, but just know it is going to be pretty damn hard.  Not because the game is difficult, but because the occasional horribly designed missions and  boss fights are going to make it that way.","May 14, 2012","true","20.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a mess of an experience and tries to pad itself with missions that require you to repeat activities or run across the world just to show off the fact you can fly about with gore shoowing out of your wrists. Mercer is completely unsympathetic, and the story collapses on itself when you think about it for more than five seconds.\n\nBut it's fun. There's something primal about dropping down into a group of twenty soldiers and just tearing them apart before devouring their commander so you can call down artillery on their heads. It's ultimately ironic when they give you all these powers and upgrades, it's impossible to use nearly any of them because of how predators hunt you down and rockets home in on your location. Often missions devolve into hiding behind buildings, eating civs and waiting for a chance to rush back in and deal a littel damage.

Some good challanges for practice, or just a break between missions is nice as well.\n\nMy Cons\nI'm not a fan of the harsh language, i.e. get ready for a lot of military speak.  And the stealth parts feel a bit easy, especially with the stealth consume perk.  Thank goodness stealth is not what this game is about.

The games glitches are constant, the story is pathetic, and the gameplay has some getting used to. It's a fun game but only for the beat down part. The sandbox element is there but don't expect much from it. If you're playing for story, look else where. The story is stupid and the missions are sometimes so unbearable. Here's a run down of a typical mission\nGo to doctor\n*5 minutes later\nDoctor wants to to kill ♥♥♥♥ for him\n*45 minutes later of contantly getting blown up by tanks and helicoptors\nDoctor tells you he can't help you\n*MISSION COMPLETED\n\nThat's a majority of the story and the game itself.\nSo overall, this game is passable but if it's on sale, get it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/RunningShovel/recommended/10150/","RunningShovel","Shovel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/RunningShovel/","231 products in account","The chief theme here will be broad strokes, which is what Prototype has. It's got the framework of a bunch of cool stuff, and it works to an extent, but there's ample room for improvement in everything. Take for example, the movement. You can climb and jump around most anything, and going in a single direction feels awesome most of the time, you can glide and dash and leap to your heart's content. But, if you're trying to get a tricky collectable from atop an antenna or building, Alex will often tweak out and flip over and around everything in sight, and it's quite a job to wrestle him into precise movements. Want to turn left or right? Hope you've got a few seconds cause unstoppable forces don't turn on a dime. Another example: Do you hate collateral damage? Don't even, cause there is nothing you have that won't wipe out a 90 degree arc about 10 feet in front of you at least. You're going to be smashing civvies and other innocents all the time, and the game gives you a nice running total of how many families you've ruined after each fight, so good luck sleeping I guess.\n\nThe actual in-game storyline is, nyeh? It's okay, it gives me an excuse to destroy all this junk, and it joins up all these events just fine. There were a couple of standout moments, but ultimately it was pretty by the numbers. It does tend to wrench control out of your hands to show you things during missions, or straight up transport you across the map afterwards, which can be annoying. The Web Of Intrigue though? That's some good stuff right there, loads of dropped hints and filling in the gaps, much speculation and other really cool junk. I spent ages just cruising the city looking for targets cause they were so interesting. Word of advice though, never skip a target movie, cause good luck remembering the name and then finding it in the hundred-something strong web.\n\nCombat: Losing relies chiefly on some very dubious things: Unavoidable chip damage, homing attacks, and super-damaging stunlocks. It's not that it's not challenging, cause you will die if you're not paying attention, but it's really going through the motions of action/reaction to the above three. Some cooped-in boss battles can make the game feel hard, and especially early in the game when you're not very powerful. Oftentimes you'll find yourself cheesing fights by staying on the move and chipping at stronger foes from range, because moving in for actual damage provides them with too many opportunities to stun/grab/hit you and it's not worth the risk. It makes fights more of a chore than fun sometimes, and that's not so great. Health is relatively easy to come by, by grabbing and eating mooks, but it makes every mistake another chore, since everything big hurts you so much you'll have to find and consume 2-3 of the little guys safely before you can re-engage. It skews the pacing and atmosphere of fights quite a bit, and it's often more advantageous to just bug out. Unless, of course, you're doing a scripted story mission or event that requires you to clear an area, in which case hunker down for the long haul. The AI isn't very smart, not at all, but they are numerous and widespread. It's not about outsmarting them, it's about outsmarting the group and learning to play the way they work to your advantage. Stealth isn't, really, but it does what it needs to and works within the larger framework. Many of the stronger enemies are niusances rather than challenges, but again you gain the powers to gib them or to lose them fairly early on, so it's not really too big of a deal.\n\nSpeaking of powers, those are pretty cool. You get a bunch of different arms, some defensive stuff, some supports, and they all have a use. You'll probably find yourself favouring one or two though, since there's quite a bit of redundancy between them. I'd have liked to see some more differentiation, but only a small fraction are mandatory so I guess not having everything must be allowed for. There's lots of stuff to spend your money on, special moves for each power as well as ones for plain old fisticuffs, movement and health upgrades, super moves, the store really does overflow with stuff. The movement too, once you figure out how to do it right, it's a joy to traverse the city and the challenges become simple matters of route rather than speed. You can fly and dash and grab walls and leap and dive, there really are a lot of things you can do and that's great. Also, when you enter the power radial selection everything slows down for a second to let you pick, and that's awesome.\n\nWhile it's not perfect, Prototype has one excellent quality: Not many other games make you feel this powerful, this badass, all of the time. You have a couple of dozen ways to destroy the dude that's ineffectually pinging at you with his rifle, and you have so much health that you can afford to decide. If he brings ten friends, it still doesn't really matter cause you can just nab one and chuck him at the others and then elbow drop the rest before zipping up a building and being five blocks away before backup even thinks of arriving. If some tougher guys decide to chase you, you're stronger and faster than them so just hit them with a ventilation unit and disappear, because you can. It broaches on God Game territory sometimes, but you're running around on the ground being all-powerful, and that feels really good.\n\n+\nFun as all hell\nOodles of powers and upgrades\nFeels godlike, man\nOptions, options, options\n\n-\nPoor PC controls\nCombat can be cheap at times\nShowing it's age graphically\n\nIn the end, Prototype was worth the time I put into it, and despite the above tirade, the good outweighs the bad. Much of it is just frustration about what could have been great but ended up being just good. But, that still leaves you with a good, fun game, with tons of things to do and stuff to see, and a lot of extra storyline junk for those interested.","July 24, 2014","true","31.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a mess of an experience and tries to pad itself with missions that require you to repeat activities or run across the world just to show off the fact you can fly about with gore shoowing out of your wrists. Mercer is completely unsympathetic, and the story collapses on itself when you think about it for more than five seconds.\n\nBut it's fun. There's something primal about dropping down into a group of twenty soldiers and just tearing them apart before devouring their commander so you can call down artillery on their heads. It's ultimately ironic when they give you all these powers and upgrades, it's impossible to use nearly any of them because of how predators hunt you down and rockets home in on your location. Often missions devolve into hiding behind buildings, eating civs and waiting for a chance to rush back in and deal a littel damage. The bosses are definitely the low part of the game; they are all immune to even your basic attacks and it comes down to cheesing your way to victory.\n\nGlad I played it, because it really helps me appreciate where games have come from and where they are going.

Pretty fun game when you are running around just blowing stuff up; but once you get down to doing some of the missions (aka the actual game) things go down hill quickly.  It is fun to just run around the city roaming around killing people but the missions really restrict things which is pretty unnecessary.  You are supposed to be some badass yet even a single enemy can pretty much kill you because the way the combat is designed you have to dodge everything with no option to block so basically if you get hit you are going to keep getting hit, and then you get hit into a corner, then you get beaten to death by giant mutant things.  Is the game worth buying though?  Sure if you get it for like 5 bucks, but just know it is going to be pretty damn hard.  Not because the game is difficult, but because the occasional horribly designed missions and  boss fights are going to make it that way.","May 14, 2012","true","20.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Your effectly "The Thing" you able to perfectly replicate any person and your body can be shaped and twised into devestating weapons on the fly.  Along with that, Movement is smooth and responsive, besides a few hiccups, it was after all one of the games that defined the super hero sandbox. The story, though bland gets the job done, but it's what had me stop playing. Don't get me wrong, it's a good game and worth the 20 bucks if you buy it not on sale, it's just I could not buy the protangoists "anti-hero" angle the story was trying the sell me...which causes the rest to fall apart as they attempted to make the enemies you fight "Blackwatch" so sterotypcially evil might as well give them snidely whiplash mustaches and kick puppies. To be fair I am only 13 hours into the game so I don't know how far I got into the story, but still..I am recomending it as game to buy..just that little problem I had with the story stacked up enough to where I didn't want to play anymore.

This game isn't the best, but it's good! I'm not a performance hunter like other people so there wasn't much of a problem for me. This game isn't exactly "new" so I'm not sure why people're trying to pick on. So far the story has been on a steady and interesting pace and the ending was prety well planned too. The only cons that I ever see in this game was the controls and the challenges. The amount of spam dash just for a single short flight is just annoying -.- and the challenge mission isn't much of a challenge either. Logic doesn't click either when I could throw a hunter without increasing heat while holding up a zombie will instantly mark me as a threat. Overall, the game is a fun experience for me, hours not wasted!","July 21, 2015","true","24.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Yet, in the end it's really not that speical. The story is weak and a complete button masher. I don't mind button mashers but the story should at least be stronger than what is presented. The plot is simple and boring but the idea of the story is good. It was just poorly brought out. Even though I can play almost any game, I feel that I would have to force myself to get through this one. If I wanted to play a game similar to this, but better, I would play InFamous. Yet, I can not complain too much about the game. The idea and upgrades are cool.

Does the game have flaws?  Well, the challenges are mostly sh*t, the graphics aren't anything special, and some enemies in the main story are just other enemies with super armor, the difficulty curve can be all over the place as well.  The story, it's pretty interesting and is told by absorbing people Ultimate Venom style, but I have a few gripes with it.  You know when a company takes an existing game style, and replaces everything with angst and edginess to appeal to the teenagers?  Well, Alex Mercer, the game's protagonist, is Shadow the Hedgehog.  He is mostly devoid of personality, and his descent into murderous tendencies is unexplained and unconvincing, but seeing how some of his "friends" react to his new personality is mildly interesting.  The last stretch is pretty forgivable, I won't give it away but it's not exactly the title music and getting the girl if you take my meaning, although the final boss is the most super armored POS in gaming history.  It's about as solid as the aforementioned Incredible Hulk: Ultimate Destruction, if you liked that game's gameplay and plot, then this game is right up your alley.  7.5 out of 10","September 4, 2015","true","21.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If anyone has ever played any of the Infamous games and enjoyed them, you will like this, has a similar feel to while not being the same.\n\nThe Story is quite interesting where it starts out towards the end, and alot of the game is basically you playing flash backs (although most if not all game is during those "flashbacks") leading up to the "beginning", and the end of the story.\n\nEven when not playing missions, there are side activities to do that will help you obtain upgrade and have fun. Outside of those, there is still sandbox style fun to have throughout the city. In some ways, progressing through the story makes the game more fun (upgrades, new/more enemies), but at the same time some makes it a little less fun (Hunters all over, military uses more heavy hardware, less neutral zones.).

I keep getting fooled by EA games. It's a fun premise, with lots of other people giving it great reviews.\n\nSome obvious short comings is resolution is capped at 720p, and cut scene audio isn't ported out correctly (you can change the latency in which audio comes in, which means unsynced audio/audio plays faster than the video in cut scenes). It's pretty bad, even for a 5 year old game - EA always does ports, and they've always turned out unpolished.\n\nMaximum AA is 2x, and in all honesty, the graphics are horrendous for a 2009 game. This looks like it was based on the first generation half life engine.\n\nAll in all tho, the story has potential, as well as the game play (game play/controls/movement is not fluid), and the beginning tutorial is kind of useless as... you have to redo another tutorial anyways. The biggest appeal to me, is like all the other reviewers said - you are an over powered beast capable of rampaging through everywhere. The terrible port of cutscenes detracts from the otherwise good story line, and the controls are pretty bad (eg: i'm standing over a gun, I press the "grab" button, and he lunges in the air hoping to grapple a non-existent target instead of the gun he's standing on top of. Problem is, his lunge moves him forward, meaning i have to reposition him per failed grab. Ugh)\n\nI don't recommend this EA port of a game, at all.

The premise is interesting, and the gameplay can be very fun, especially with the power to bounce around manhattan and wreak absolute havoc.  But there are points in the game that are so frustrating that they simply make the game unenjoyable.  I don't want to spend an hour doing the same repetitive pop in, blow something up. run away, fight off 10 helicopters, go stealthy, start over thing with every damn task in the game.  it just stops being fun. when the game glitched at the end and I can't get past a specific cut scene, I simply gave up.  It's not even worth even finding out what the ending is, because the game is so frustrating and repetitive.  I don't say this often, but I just didn't this game that much.  Interesting and different, but repetitive and frustrating are the bottom lines.  The controls can be a bit aggravating as well.","May 16, 2015","false","19.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game has it all.\nThe only issue I have with it is the sheer amount of useless upgrades in the "combat" section.\nYou can buy an upgrade to slam your fists together and stun nearby enemies, or you can buy an upgrade to slam your fists on the ground and stun nearby enemies. Both have pretty much the same effect, there's no reason to buy both.\nThere's also an upgrade for a pointless palm slam and an uppercut with an air-combo followup you never get to use because the uppercut only launches humans but also kills most of them in one hit, which goes against the point of launching them in the first place.\nSo basically, where there should've been a shield upgrade and something to make the claws and the hammerfists not useless after you get the blade, they came up with four different shockwave jump attacks. Where there should've been an upgrade to hold multiple disguises, they came up with an upgrade to accuse someone of being you. Where there should've been a sprint-consume upgrade, they came up with a cannonball attack.\nAnyway, this game is really fun if you don't spend hours getting EXP for Kung Fu moves you'll never use.","May 17, 2015","true","23.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If it involves doing some very cruel things for fun like assimilating others into your memories to accumulate more knowledge and power, then I'll do it without hesitation.\n\nThis game is for those like me. Those who need a wide open area, a neat selection of awesome powers to pull off various ways of killing enemies and a whole lot of time!\n\nThe selection includes:\n\nWhiplash - Whip your enemies and tear them in half, cling onto helicopters and pull yourself to them or hit them several times from far away even while in mid-air and cause them to plummet to their doom.\n\nMusclemass - Wanna play more normally, on foot, beat the living snot out of people and send them flying? You can do just that and plenty more!\n\nHammerfists - Pounding things into the ground sound like your style? Send tanks into the concrete with each smash? Do an elbow drop from several feet high and do devastating damage when you land? This is the one for you!\n\nBlade -  Sever your enemies in a clean half, swing your blade around and around, tearing those apart around you, sending heads and limbs alike flying.\n\nThat was just the abilities you can use. You can do so much more like:\n\nThermal vision - See enemies through smoke and obstacles at the expense of decreased vision range.\nInfected vision - Highlight those with the BLACKLIGHT virus as well as military units.\nKeep in mind it muffles all your other senses like hearing in order to focus on his sight.\n\nYou can also disguise! Assimilating others will not only restore your health but you will take on their appearance! Convert into an everyday citizen or even the military! Act inconspicuous amongst the enemy, take down important targets, stay out of their sight and certain equipment and they won't even know you're there!\nOne offensive and defensive power may be active at a time. Using any of your powers while disguised completely negates the current disguise.\n\nThere's also a really fun mechanic called Devastators. You need to be in Critical Mass (a state of almost dead or the complete opposite, having excess stored biomass and increased health). They include:\n\n- Tendril Barrage: Fires impaling tendrils from your body in all directions.\n- Groundspike Graveyard: Erupts massive spikes from the ground all around you.\n- Critical Pain: A single beam of hardened biomass protrudes from your hands to severely damage a single target.\n\nWhile you sprint, you automatically hop over cars, barriers and other obstacles without loss of momentum. You will also knock any humanoids aside without stopping if they get in your way.\nYour jump height can accel upwards to five-story buildings.\nYou will scale any buildings you come in contact with.\nDevastating drops cause a shockwave beneath you. Falling height also factors into a bunch of your attacks.\n\nThis game is extremely fun and a great stress reliever. If you like variety like me, you'll like this game.\nI recommend it to everyone who can get their hands on it!","December 22, 2015","true","65.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
