"http://steamcommunity.com/id/shoggofu/recommended/302180/","shoggofu","YouTube shoggofu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/shoggofu/","257 products in account","I played this game for just under two hours. I found it interesting, but I spent at least half the time being stuck and not knowing what to do.\n- It's another old (2005) point and click adventure from this publisher and developer, but the user interface is better than their other similar titles\n- Your objectives are vague and it is easy to spend a very long time stuck and unable to make progress just by missing a single small detail\n\nhttp://youtu.be/64AirnGvTYA\nhttp://youtu.be/m2S-aiyGCvs\nYou have a pre-rendered 360 degree panoramic view of your environment. When you move to different locations your perspective will be that of the new location. I haven't played Myst before. But I've been told that this is basically what Myst is like.\n-----You interact with the environment in order to solve problems and progress through game. You find many items which can be used with certain objects in the environment. Certain inventory items can be combined with others to create new objects. Not all items appear to be essential to progressing through the game. Some items and actions appear to unlock extras such as information about characters and lore about the alien species.\n-----So you start in the very confined space of the shell which has been fired out of giant cannon to take you to the moon. It was an interesting location. But unfortunately I spent over an hour in this tiny little area area. This was because I often became stuck and couldn't figure out what to do.\n-----Inside the shell you periodically get to the point where you are running out of oxygen and need to find a way to remedy the situation. Once this happens you have about a minute to get more oxygen otherwise you die. I died at least twenty times or so. When you die you reappear in the shell and you lose no items or progress, nothing in the ship resets to it's originals state. So dying from lack of oxygen didn't really serve any purpose except to be a nuisance. It took me quite me a while to find the solution the first time. The second time also took me a quite a while to discover. I basically found myself scraping the bottom of the barrel. I had to actually look up a walk-through. It turned out that all I needed to do was turn a small wheel. I had no idea about this even though I'd searched through the whole shell again and again. This is what I spent most my two hours stuck on.\n-----Finally I arrived on the moon. Which was an interesting place. There were various colorful and animated plants, I came across some alien technology and you had to made great leaps across a chasm in order to navigate the environment.\n-----But I soon got a stuck again for a substantial amount of time. Only when I was coming to the end of my two hour play-through did I figure out how to progress some more. Again it was something kind of obvious which I'd just overlooked. Things at that point got a bit more interesting again, but unfortunately I didn't have time to keep playing.\n-----I know some people will be against this notion. But sometimes it can be too frustrating to get stuck for so long. It would have been cool if there were more specifics hints. This feature could be optional so that people who want to do it the hard way still can. Hints could have cool-down and only become available once you have been stuck for a certain amount of time in order to prevent over-reliance on them.  But it's probably a bit too much to ask from an old game, and yes I'm sure some people would feel it would ruin the challenge.\n-----When I stopped playing I'd found several alien machines. Including a coin operated telescope which was quite amusing. There is also a whole series of 'ideograms', basically alien hieroglyphics. You are able to decipher these in order to understand some of their meanings. I thought that was quite interesting. These ideograms apparently must play a role in understanding the operation of the alien devices and so on. I also caught sight of the aliens but I was unable to get close enough to interact with any of them.\n\nThe game looks alright, keep in mind it is an old title. I think the pre-rendered graphics is a better alternative to 3D graphics which probably wouldn't have looked very good at a level that PCs were capable of running back then. Some areas can look a bit plain, such as the interior of the shell especially if you've been stuck in it for over an hour lol\n-----Once I'd gotten to the moon, the game reminded me a quite a bit of the another old point and click adventure title, The Dig. That game was by Lucasarts and in it you also travel through space and spend the game on a alien planet solving puzzles to progress.\n\nI like the game, but I'd find it hard to make the time for. Ideally this is a good game if you are prepared to spend a lot of time figuring out what to do and have a lot of patience in case you get stuck for extended periods unable to make progress. Otherwise you could refer to a walk-though to guide you. There is at least one available which is you can find on YouTube.\n\nClick here for my YouTube gaming channel","August 29, 2014","true","3.6"," 73 of 88 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","73","88","0","0"

Jules Verne's is my favorite arthor of all time!... Growing up from childhood i always thought he is an alien. So many things he wrote in the book came out to be true fact way after he passed away. And soo many items he imaging became our everyday life today.\n\nSeriously.. how can anyone know that weightlessness exist in space? and there is no oxy in space?\n\nAnyhow, When I found this game in my library i have 21 friends own this game but no has played it.\n\nSo i give it a shoot and finished it just short of 4 hours with 792 int score... which is not bad.\nI only needed the hint and guide to get me out of stuck 5 times the entire game.\n\nThis game is surprisng well made with a lot funny dialoge, interesting facts, wonderful puzzle, laughable soundeffect, and grand story. Being born in 21 centry we know a lot facts about space travel and lunar trips and etc. So we know most of those things in the story are not true but soo many of the things are right too. It's amazing.\n\nFor a puzzle game with point and click it's very well done and really makes me feel good when I solve a puzzle.\n\nThe graphics has aged but still pretty well done compare to some of the recently made indie games.\n\n8.5/10.. recommend to puzzle lovers...","September 12, 2015","true","3.7"," 18 of 18 people (100%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","100","18","18","3","1"

For anyone interested in point-and-click adventure games I do recommend getting it though, especially because it is quite cheap with a coupon.\n\nI played this game back in 2006 I think and am very happy to see it on Steam since I lost my old copy of the game. I found the puzzles actually very fun and the entire game is put together well with 360 degree views of certain areas in a good amount of detail, especially for a game from 2005. There is only a couple timed puzzles, though dying in the them does nothing except cause a small cutscene which is easily skippable - also being able to save at any point in the game is useful. The inventory system is easy to use, though organising it can be a little tedious. Also, there is multiple ways of solving most things, and some puzzles aren't even required to do until later in the game - (You might even solve a puzzle without knowing what it's for until later!)\n\nOverall, A very good point-and-click puzzle-adventure game.\n\nFor anyone who can't solve puzzles and requires a walkthough there is a couple on the internet, and I have written my own in the Steam 'Guides' page if you are interested, it also explains how to set up the game on Windows 7, and it might also work for 8.

Saw how old it was but thought "o well might as well check it out"\nAnd ooh boy...did I get sucked in.  I am allready a big fan of point n click adventures, and this is a true classic. I have to admit i got impatient at times, not taking enough time to read back in my log.\n\nSome parts I found quite hard. I did not finish it without a lot of dying and trial and error. And also peeking  a walkthrough from time to time. Usually the result of that was me thinking: , ahh yeh, this makes sense, i should have thought about that.  At 1 occassion i found a mistake.  I got so frustrated , that eventually a walkthrough helped me.  Only way i could have maybe solved this was by randomly trying combinations.  I iwll describe the issue below with a spoiler alert. Altho not knowing is rather a spoiler in this case;)\nAt some point you have to call out for the aliens outside using an organ. You have to push the button in a certain order to get the aliens moving. One alien , according to the instructions should be called with first the blue and then red button. This is not true! This must be first purple and then red!\n\nThe story is very cool, the variation of puzzles too.  It really felt like learning a new language;) Also the reward for completing parts is nice. You unlock parts of the story with that.\n\nAbolutely recommened for point n click lovers....\n\n....and Jules Verne lovers. After all, the story is about his book. And since he is a brilliant writer, that alone makes  playing this game worthwhile.\n\nGlad I managed to land safely on earth again and glad I discovered this adventure.\n\n\n9/10","December 5, 2015","true","26.4"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","9","9","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Zeronii/recommended/302180/","Zeronii","【USG/BQ-Mod】Zeroni","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Zeronii/","608 products in account","Overall: 7.6 / 10\n\nVoyage: Journey to the Moon is a title that deserved more popularity than it had gotten in my opinion.  This is probably one of the reasons the game never received its sequel which is in my opinion a big shame, even although at the end of the game you are given a small teaser for it.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nGraphics: 7.5 / 10\n- The game does look very beautiful from time to time, whilst other times it looks alright. There we're quite a decent amount of details put into certain parts of both the map and items. It is obvious the game was polished quite a lot considering its current state and the fact it first came out in 2005.\n\nStory: 7.5 / 10\n- Scary, fun and intriguing for the most part. Worst part of it was at the very start of the game where there were a few small loopholes as well as the fact that at one point you get into a "react or die" situation without any instructions, which is not that bad really, as the game allows you to lose a life in many different scenarios (including falling into an empty elevator shaft because you forgot to call the elevator first) but without any penalty. After death, you are not brought back to the menu or loaded in from the last save, but rather just a moment before fatal decision was made. However, game gets a lot better once you land on the moon.\nOn the way you learn about plant and alien life, as well as social organisation of the aliens, their language, writing and technology and their relations with the human kind. You may also reach earth by not doing everything there is to do, and thus skipping something or doing it a different way. I personaly found the story to be quite short, peaking up to 6.8 hours on record from start to completion with all the time taken to solve the puzzles on the way but overall, I loved it.\n\nPuzzles: 8 / 10\n- I found puzzles not to be too hard, although they do have a small difficulty curve as you progress, meaning they get harder and harder. This is good because I believe the game would be enjoyable to both a casual gamer and those in for a quick challenge. It is obvious the puzzles are made by a human rather than an inhabitant of the moon and should demand an avarage logic skill to beat. They blend into the story perfectly as no puzzle is there just for the sake of its existence but rather, everything has a meaning. They are not repetative either, so you should not feel bored during the game.\n\nSound: 7 / 10\n- The strong point of the sound is definitely its soundtrack. Main menu music has a really pleasant and suitable vibe for the type of the game. Voice acting is fine and so are other general sounds, although they are nothing to point your finger at.\n\nFun factor: 8 / 10\n\n\nRecommended!","February 12, 2015","true","6.8"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

The puzzle is good but it needs high creativity and thinking that makes the puzzle too hard sometimes. I can finish this game earlier than I expected because I searched for walkthrough lol. I stuck at many points because the puzzle needs some rollback about what you saw earlier.\n\nAnyway, this is a good game. Recommend this game for someone who likes science fiction story and point and click adventure game.

But, one of the main reasons I play adventure games is that I don't want to have to deal with the pressure of fast action or quick reflexes. However, not long into the game, you suddenly realize that it's getting a bit difficult to breathe, and a timer starts for you to figure out how to increase the oxygen level in your little capsule. Inevitably, the timer runs out before you find the right action, and your tragic death is announced. Of course, the timer resets, and you have another go at it, until you meet your second untimely death, then your third, or however many tries it takes before you discover (or look up) how to get past the barrier.\n\nThen, when you get to the moon, there are these large crevasses to cross by jumping just the right amount in the moon's low gravity. Now, "just the right amount" is determined by a needle that is moving up and down. If you hit the key when the needle is in the green region, you make it across. If not, the announcer is back with another enthusiastic heralding of your untimely death. It's terribly demoralizing.\n\nWhat's worse, there is some bug that prevents the menu from displaying properly so that you can't always save (or exit!) the game reliably once you've crossed some annoying hurdle.\n\nAfter a couple of hours, I found the game too frustrating to continue, which is a shame, because the story and graphics seemed promising.","November 26, 2015","false","1.9"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/klippy5/recommended/302180/","klippy5","Klippy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/klippy5/","124 products in account","Still a very nice first person adventure game.\nI played this game when it came out and really enjoyed it, like most of the Microïds adventure games of its time.\nThe story is told in a simple but fun way and it really grips you because there is a lot to discover.  I especially like the many things you can do with the fruit.\nIt is quite challenging at times, but never too difficult or too easy. Even the second  time playing it ten years later I had forgotten a lot of details and had a lot of fun reliving the experience and puzzles.\nToday it looks a bit more dated offcourse, but for yhe genre that is no problem at all and you soon forget about resolutions when you are playing.\nGive it a chance and you will love it.","May 8","true","12.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
