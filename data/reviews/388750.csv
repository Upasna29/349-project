(BBCF is still only on JPN arcades atm)\n+ Online mode works. Yes, a working online mode. In 2016. Isn't that amazing?\n+ One of the best, if not the best, netcode.\n+ DirectInput Support.\n+ Single player content. TONS of them. (Arcade, Story mode, Challenge, Abyss, Score Attack, Unlimited Mars, Challenge, Training, an extra story mode, and a couple of stuff for newcomers)\n+ Tutorial will show you the ropes and Challenge mode can make you master some complex combos.\n+ Great gameplay. Kinda hard at first, but it's all fun after that.\n+ Tons of chars, each one with a unique gameplay.\n+ It's not Street Fighter.\n+ Contains all DLCs from the console.\n+ Can change the annoying default system voice to many others. desuno!\n+ Great soundtrack. (subjective)\n+ Customize your lobby to look fab.\n+ Can play BBCP instead of BBCPE if you want. We love you kokonoe :3\n+ EU players don't have to wait a whole year :v\n+ Amazing story mode (subjective). Now with the obligatory beach episode, plus a recap episode (for CT/CS events)...\n+ Celica. Izayoi.\n\nCons: (trying to be picky, they're mostly non-issues)\n- No online cross-play with consoles. Online might feel like a ghost town sometimes, as most ppl interested in the game already got it on consoles aeons before this PC release.\n- I don't have a 5:3 monitor, so any resolution i pick will look weird (with black bars on corners or stretched image. Arcade resolution is 1280x768).\n- 720p sprites look weird unless im on 768p windowed or lower...\n- No resolution option above 1080p, in case you wanted to make your 720p sprites look even worse. (EDIT: Thanks, uh, Batman for pointing out that you can edit it in the DisplaySetting.cfg in your Documents folder)\n- Low quality OP video. It's as if PCs had limited HD...\n- Can't customize the accept/cancel buttons for menu.\n- Terumi. Bang.\n\nConflicted:\n* So many characters, it makes it harder for newcomers to learn all them matchups...\n* Not so mod-friendly. Because, sprites.\n* The included "OST" is SONG INTERLUDE II album ( http://vgmdb.net/album/38796 ) + 2 Tsubaki themes (Condemnation Wings II and Memory of Tears II). Just to let ppl know what this "OST" actually is.\n* Platinum.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Nightshadefox/recommended/388750/","Nightshadefox","Nightshadefox","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Nightshadefox/","142 products in account","Blazblue has been a personal favorite of the fighting game genre. I can say without a doubt this has been one of the best versions of the games. Learning the mechanics for each character can take some serious work, especially for the challenge mode. But its the best way to understand how to combo with each character. But the balance for each character and their abilities have been adjusted for each character to a much better degree than the previous titles. Even the story mode has a simple ark to follow rather than going through 20 individual stories like with Calamity Trigger or Continuum Shift. Not to mention trying to get 100% through the true, bad, and gag endings. But the gag scenes are all their for each character and has fit in well for the same humor to follow. The extra modes in this title no doubt will give a few newbies a rage run given the extended difficulty. But even under the fustration of learning all the Distoration Finishes and Astral Heat finishings, the characters are still strong and makes one want to dive deeper into mastering the characters fully. I will give one warning, the story will still confuse some that have not seen or played through the others since some things may not make sense. Even then, its still a great story to follow up with and the fighting is just as intense. But with all the characters having their mechnical features, Bullet is a really tough one to take up. Not just her special mechnic of heat drives and dives seems pretty weak. Not to mention she does not have the best moves to open up to in combat compared to those that are faster and have range attacks. So fair warning if using her in anything... and I know there might be someone that knows how to use her better than me, but this is just a simple perspective and oberservation given the time I have played this game. In terms of time for the game, if you want to get through everything and unlock all thats possible, following up with Abyss Mode to get the most currency out of the game... its most likely to be 40-50 hours of game time for a first time run. Especially if you want to get through the hard modes and higher levels. Pratice will make perfect.Im excited to see this not just come to Steam, but now I can take Makoto Nanaya anywhere and crush all that stand before her! Sorry, I just love that character for her personality and kick buutt power! Moving on, the music continues to hold strong for not just the characters themes: but for the background themes too. Making the matches more exciting to push ahead and show everything one has for that victory. Even having the old levels and music from the previous games to be bought with the in game currency. Even having the famous Teach me Miss Litichi sceens are back for all the history and understanding the Blazblue world, and look it up for a good laugh. Overall, this game easily earns a 8/10. Worth buying anytime and expore the insane combos and story between all the characters.","March 2","true","21.4"," 28 of 40 people (70%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","70","28","40","4","1"

The story mode with its branching story paths was good in terms of narrative, though I feel it suffers from "wall of text" syndrome a bit. This might sound ironic what with the story mode of these being in a visual novel style with the fighting gameplay in between, this story has a lot more of the former and not as much of the latter...except for one part where there's a ton in quick succession. Also I kind of miss having individual character stories, but ah well. Extend added a couple additional story paths based before Chronophantasma, CT/CS recaps, and an entire section dedicated to additional gag reels, what more could you ask for?\n\nOther than a personal nit-pick in terms of text:fight ratio, the game brings about what Chronophantasma offered (my two favourite character additions being Bullet and Terumi), along with Celica and the return of Lambda-11, so there's even more waifu to choose from! Jokes aside the combat in this entry is faster paced than previously, and I love it for it. The remixed tracks from older entries are more intense and also more guitar heavy mostly, bringing it closer to Guilty Gear levels, but not Metal enough to be there yet.\n\n9/10 would Inferno Divider again.

I could add that:\n\n-A lot more characters than before\n-The pace is faster , the rounds are more nervous\n-the gameplay is deepend, with new mechanics (and still friendly ! )\n-the content is much bigger\n-the network works even more smoothly than in BBCSE\n\nOK OK , one negative point : the story is more straight forward than on the last games ; you can't play the story of each characters like before , but only multiple branches , which makes the story for me more linear. But hell , the story is still great and makes the difference with mainstream fighting games like SF\n\nSo yes go get it if you like the fighting games genre\n\n19/20","March 2","true","42.1"," 16 of 23 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","16","23","0","2"

It is really detailed and interesting to read.\nThere is even more humor bits and story like "Remix Heart Gaiden" and everyones favourite "Teach Me More, Miss Litchi"\nGraphics is the same though there are improvements.\nMore fighters in the roosters which is a welcome addition. It brings to a total of 28. Each are unique with they own strength and weakness. Some require more skill when used on "Technical" as their Combo is pretty hard to pull off or just hard to actually play them. Example Haku-men.\nYou get all the DLCs from the Console version without additional cost + the Original Sountrack which is rare to many JP Games as usually they have License Trouble.\n20% Loyalty Discount for anyone who loved this series though will expired on the 10th March of this Review.\nA Very solid port with very little issues on bugs that won't affect your gameplay experience.\nThe game is very friendly to beginners with its Tutorial and the use of "Stylish" which auto-combos for you but its disable when playing Online. Its really does help teaches you how to play and very friendly in terms of explanation.\nBeware you do not put the COM Difficulty to 100, it will literally beat your ♥♥♥ to the ground.\nNetwork mode has this Lobby room where you can customize your room. Its like a friendly lobby for people to come in and go rather than the plain Lobby.\nHaven't really tried it very much as the Story and Arcade is far more important due to preference.\nVoice acting is godly.

Good netplay, I went to ranked match straight away and never had to wait to find a match. Only 1 match was laggy out of about 25 and that's because I forgot to set my connection quality restrictions.

Has a lot of content to offer besides multiplayer (looking at you SFV). Arcade, Story, training, Abyss, Unlimited mars, etc.\n6. Character design and animation is top notch.\n7. Every character has an OverDrive which allows for really unique combos.\n\nCons:\n1. BlazBlue in general can be difficult to learn if you're new, and some people online are already good from PS4 version.\n2.

We can see a huge gameplay improvement from Continuum Shift and upgraded soundtrack from the previous two chapters.\nWhat really changed from these two chapters?\n\n\n+ The gameplay: They added a new mechanic called the "Overdrive" which consist of "powering up" our character for increased damage with the distortions (the super moves) replacing the classic burst. Some characters where buffed or nerfed and got new moves. The newcomers they are cool, I don't see anything wrong about them.\n+ The soundtrack: Holy macaroni! They manage to create a even more awesome soundtrack from Calamity Trigger and Continuum Shift!\n+ Story: I'm not going to spoil anything but if you didn't play the previous two games or watched the anime (don't do it it's ♥♥♥♥) there are two very short recaps of the games. But they don't help much.\n+- The story is a Visual Novel. I prefered they animated all scenes instead of using sprites. If you like VNs you won't bother reading the story\n- Online is... very poor... Sure there are some people doing lobbies but the ranked scene feels like it's dead. You have to be lucky to find someone at your level and... if you're a newbie... good luck heh\n+- The combo system is really fun! But... can be exploited for massive damage combos, which can be annoying if you're playing with a very good player. But doing one of these combos is really hard so you have to practise... A LOT.\n- The online needs his netcode to be fixed. If playing with someone with low fps it will be a lag fest\n- The balance: Some characters doesn't seems right, sure it wasn't a mess like Chronophantasma 1.0 but it needs to be fixed (probably they won't because they are focusing on the next Blazblue game) I've made a Tier list for fun because some characters are too strong for others. I've made that based on the Eventhubs leaderboard[www.eventhubs.com] and the Gamefaqs forums\n\n\nAnd so...

Combos are easier in this game than they are in Guilty Gear, so that's a plus.  But to help reduce the execution barrier for newcomers, BlazBlue introduced stylish mode, which I still don't fully understand yet as I'm a technical player and prefer to use technical mode for that reason, but one of my friends who's very new to fighting games, is able to fight me on pretty even footing with stylish mode.  Given, I'm still pretty new to this game and still have a lot of growing to do in my skill level, but it's the first time I've seen him not suck, and actually have fun playing a fighting game, so I guess that makes BlazBlue the most approachable fighting game I've seen yet (give or take Evil Zone on the PlayStation or Super Smash Bros.).\n\nThe graphics are nice, and the 2D sprites are good, but I feel like they need a little more anti-aliasing to smooth out the outlines a bit.  Still, it's a great looking game and it actually has a lot of special VS intros between the characters, like many older fighting games had, most notably Capcom VS SNK 2.  I missed seeing those and I'm really glad BlazBlue's keeping that tradition alive instead of just using the same intro animations over and over regardless of whether or not your characters have a direct story-line beef with each other.  The game's mechanics are solid, yet smooth as well, and there's a huge variety in play styles among the massive cast of characters.  If you like anime fighting games or Arcsys fighting games, you're not going to want to miss this one.\n\nPros:\nGreat graphics, 3D backgrounds, 2D sprites.\nCharacter specific VS intros.\nLots of dialogue.\nStory mode's awesome.\nGame is awesome.\nBeginner friendly.\n\nCons:\nA newer installment's already out in Japanese arcades, but at least we're not three or four games behind anymore.","March 10","true","179.5"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","7","7","0","1"

It features extensive tutorials on overall gameplay mechanics, followed by character specific tutorials and tactical tips. The challenge mode also offers insight into practical combos for each character to use. The game also features stylish mode, where even the most casual players can enoy seing incredible combos and effects.\n\nGraphically, the game has gorgeous character sprites mixed with full 3D backgrounds. Due to the game being anime style, the art aesthetic will be either hit or miss: if you greatly dislike anime art style, this could be a deal breaker.\n\nBlazblue series is characterized by a varied cast, each character having a unique gameplay mechanic. While some characters are weaker than others, there as an alright sense of balance. Due to characters having different gameplay mechanics, Blazblue is much harder to balance than Mortal Kombat X for example. While these differences may go unnoticed by new players, on competative level, you can clearly see certaiin characters being superior to others.\n\nSome of the characters will be hit-or-miss due to their designs, more so than in other games.\n\nA lot of people complain that the story is generally reading through walls of text, which is true since tis is a visual novel. Honestly though, most fighting games dont even bother having a story. If you are sceptical about te story, ust give it a chance, as the good story telling is what set original Blazblue:Calamity Trigger game apart from the many 2D fighting games. But at te end of the day, if you still dislike it, you can simply use the skip function and breeze through it,\n\nThe online experience on the PC port was disappointing to say te least. Latency issues, frequent disconnects and random frame rate drops are all present here. Whike you can find fixes for some of te issues here on the forums, its disappointing that the publisher didn't adress those issues. In my opinion, this is the main deal breaker, as you want to play online wit oter people after you have played through the various single-player game modes.\n\nTL;DR: A solid fighting game, suitable for newcomers to figting games and veterans alike. Unique characters each with their own gameplay mechanics, rendered in glorious sprites. A robust storymode suffering from wall-of-text syndrome, and a grat offering of other singlepayer modes. The main issue with the port is the spotty online functionality.","March 23","true","18.9"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","6","7","0","0"

None really seems overpowered\n-Amazing soundtrack\n-Contains a side story explaining the events in Calamity Trigger and Continuum Shift so new players aren't left in the dark. I do reccomend playing those if you want the full experience though\n\nCons:\n-The story mode can get a bit carried away with the story sometimes and occasionally forgets it's a game. As such there's a very high cutscene-to-gameplay ratio to the point where it could rival even Metal Gear. Don't look to the story mode for gameplay\n-Hard to get into if you're new to fighting games and don't know where to start. If you are new, start with tutorial, practice between each lesson and then move on to challenge mode to learn how to chain combos. There is something called stylish mode if you'd rather play the game casually which basically plays part of the game for you but where's the fun in that?\n-Story can get a bit overwhelming at times. They use alot of big words which originate from all over the world and it can get hard to keep track of what's what. If you forget what something is, check out the library which contains a bunch of short articles explaining characters and objects.\n\n\nTL;DR\nBlazBlue Chronophantasma and the whole BlazBlue series as a whole is a bit of a niche franchise. You need to put alot of time into these games to fully understand them. Both in terms of story and gameplay. But once you get into it you will never get out. The captivating world and story keep me coming back to analyze, finding something new every time.\n\nThis game gets a 9/10","April 11","true","38.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

I however have a full version of my review on the link below here which includes both a "Newcomers" Review and a "Returning Player" Review going indepth. My review on this game is lengthy mainly because there's a lot to talk about (and I love it). Finally have my hours in so I can safely review.\n\nEnjoy\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/app/388750/discussions/0/\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIntroduction\nHello Everyone, I’ve been really excited to make this review for so long! For anyone who’s been on the forums, we’ve loved talking about what we were planning to do in this game and now it’s here!\n\nI’ve poured my heart and soul into this review to help give you the best idea of what this game is, why I think it’s great, and why at the very least, you should try it.\n\nFor those worried of a “terrible port”. The company literally delayed this game a few times and pushed it back a month to make sure it worked properly. We also had something to let us know they were working on it. Dedication to the fanbase right there.\n\nStory  ---------------------------------------------------\n\nThe main selling point of Blazblue to many would have to be its story. The complexity of Blazblue offers a person several different possibilities, but with only one true way. When you play the game’s storyline, you’re presented with various options. Whether you beat the person and kill him, or lose but still have the story continue. There are also choices you can make further increasing the possible routes. There is also not really a “main” character almost, as each person in the game all have individual storylines to playthrough with individual options and outcomes. There is a ton of things to do for people who like to complete 100% on each available character (different outcomes).\n\nThe issue many people seem to have with the game is the story can be confusing. In previous titles, there were shifts in time which made it extremely difficult to pinpoint when something was happening. To newer players I saw however: Don't stop trying to understand this. It's got one of the best storylines in a game, and in fact, it explains the "cliff notes" of the previous two titles to help you understand! This game's plot wasn't as complicated however which led myself kinda sad considering the complexity of the previous titles. The fun of just figuring out the story was one of the reasons why Blazblue became so addicting in the first place.\n\nVoice acting is stellar as always with my personal favorite being Hazama. Every character has a unique voice to which  they have as well. This adds to the better immersion of the game and its very fun to listen to some of the characters interactions. Some VO were changed however which was sad (I.E. Bang) and they don't sound the best. The majority of the cast do however.\n\nGameplay  ------------------------------------------------\n\nI have great news for both casual fighters and veteran fighters which I’m pointing out right now than later. This game has two different mode options: Technical and Stylish. The first is where you do the manual input of all the commands. The second one (PAY ATTENTION CASUALS) allows you to pull off combos by hitting one button. ONE BUTTON. That means you don’t have to be moving your joystick around a bunch, getting messed up over forgetting that one part of a combo, now you can combo like a pro without having to do advanced joystick and button moves. This makes it so that even casual fighting player can take on a veteran. Now that I’ve said it, moving on.\n\nThe game’s fighting style is the typical 2d fighting with twists. Your button layout can be customized to whatever you prefer as well. Now, I’ve never been a huge fan of “fighting games” as I’m terrible at them. When I first purchased Continuum Shift, I really hated the fact that I was terrible and had to turn the AI down to easy in order to get anywhere. However, thanks to the various options of button layout, being able to choose style or technical gameplay, I’ve slowly gotten better. The AI difficulty can range from Beginner to Very Hard. This is great for casual and veterans alike.\n\nThe fighting moves are the typical fight: Light, Medium, Heavy, and special. You can also perform Distorion drives (speical) and Astral Heat (ending special).\n\nOnline Play  -------------------------------------------------\nThis brief saying is for the competitive people. Again, I’ve never really been into “online” play much as I’m terrible with fighting games. However, one of the things that Blazblue does well which other games do not is a standout.\nThe netcode is practically better than console. There is almost no input lag period. Anyone who loves online play fighters will cheer for this because Blazblue does it extremely well. There are leaderboards also included for tracking player stats. Due to the fact that this game isn’t the most “popular” with the world as is should be, sometimes finding people can be a little hard.\n\nMusic  ------------------------------------------------\nMany people who’ve played this game LOVE the music. Myself, while I don’t entirely enjoy rock/metal, Blazblue has always done it in a way where I do like it. That for me is a plus. As with previous titles, you can listen to the soundtrack anytime on your computer by going to the CP folder. This addition is great for all Blazblue players who enjoy the game.\n\nSome of the themes in Blazblue have been replaced with new remixes like Terumi for example. Depending on your preference, this can be either good or bad. The opening is still as wonderful as ever with the intro music being probably one of the best ones ever. It really gets you pumped for playing the game!\n\n\nConclusion  ------------------------------------------------------\nAll-in-all, the game delivers nicely and should not be overlooked as another typical fighting game. You have a great story, fun gameplay for new and old fighting players, a wonderful unlock system, and plain fun as well. I give this my personal recommendation and advise you buy it. If you’re not looking to spend money just yet, you could wait till Calamity Trigger goes on sale for about $2 and try it at the very least.","March 3","true","73.1"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","3"

I really like this idea, hope more fighters implement it. As for single player BlazBlue has always had a huge convoluted story, and that's ok.

In CSE, while I had perfect FPS in a match, the Menus and Character Select were really slow for some reason, 30-40 FPS at times. Also, Astral Finishes would constantly send the game down to 30 FPS. Chronophantasma only dips when loading a match for only 1/4 of a second. This is from playing on a laptop with integrated graphics. Well done Arc on that.\n\nSound:\nAs expected of an Arc figther, the soundtrack is amazing. Some of the remix tracks are a little hit and miss, but over all great quality music. Sadly, sound test is completely absent. The bonus Soundtrack is also a little underwhelming. It only brings tracks unique to Extend content for the most part.\n\nStory:\nQuite extensive this go around. Not only do you have the main story and gag reels but you also get abriged versions of the previous games, a short but enjoyable Remix Heart, a Library section to look up anything pertaining to the setting and characters, new gag reels, and more.\n\nCharacters:\nAs to be expected, the new additions are just as interesting as the returning cast. Each designed around unique gameplay styles.\n\nModes:\nA large selection of modes to spend your time in. The training modes are quite extensive with a good tutorial, combo challenge modes, as well as training mode. Other modes include: Arcade, Score Attack, Unlimited Mars (still as insane as ever), a redesigned Abyss mode, and Highlander if you complete the main story. One quick note on Abyss mode, this time around, you will not lose your hard earned currency if you don't make it through the entire run. While I did like the risk in the previous Abyss mode of CSE, I am fine with this change.\n\nOnline:\nThe netcode works pretty good for most of my experiences. Most of my matches have performed flawlessly with hardly/no delay. Your milage may vary. As for waiting to find matches, it has range for me from approx 5 minute wait to as short as a few seconds of entering into ranked pool.\n\nExtras:\nYou can now save Local Replays from VS Mode!!! The gallery mode is mostly the same as CSE, but there is a whole lot more to unlock this go around. However, once again, the complete lack of Sound Test can really hurt for many people (myself included).\n\nOverall, this is a solid port thats very fairly priced (especially if you already have previous games for the discount).","March 18","true","302.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TLG-X/recommended/388750/","TLG-X","Xx TLG xX","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TLG-X/","54 products in account","UPDATED ON 18 MARCH\n\nWell well well... Look what we have here: Another installment of one of my most favorite franchises on steam! Hey ArcSys/H2, thank you for this.\nOkay, let's see how good this one is. WARNING: This is going to be long! Also, BOSS FIGHT SPOILERS!\n\nBefore we begin, I just want to say this game REALLY reminded me of Guilty Gear Xrd -SIGN- at first; because of Guilty Gear characters' icons for your profile, nearly similar design for library section, Izayoi's dash move which is incredibly similar to I-No's dash from GGXRD and the overdrive mechanic which activates by pressing all 4 attack buttons together (sounds familiar, huh?).\n\nFirst things first, unlike some other fighting games that sacrifice offline modes (you know which ones I mean), this game has a lot of single player content. Story mode consists of the main story and continues from where Continuum Shift was ended; along with extend verion's story, anthology which explains the story of previous titles in a not expectable way, another ((Teach Me Miss Litchi!)) and a storyline named Remix Heart which I tried it recently and has a very... um... weird story. You'll understand what I mean when you play it. Then there is arcade mode, versus, abyss mode (some kind of survival mode), unlimited mars mode and score attack mode. So, if you want to play this offline because of reasons (like myself), you're going to be entertained for a long time.\n\nAnd now, the gameplay! well... the gameplay has changed a bit compared to the last game. First, some of the mechanics are changed. For example, Ragna's Blood Kain move is removed and it's effects are replaced with his overdrive (Blood Kain IDEA). The second is the overdrive that I mentioned before. Overdrive can enhance and increase the damage of your attacks but it only lasts for a limited time and it's gauge needs to be recharged after use. Also, during overdrive, time counter will freeze so it can be used to your advantage. And one more thing, if you use burst, you cannot use overdrive and vice versa; Because the gauge for both of them are the same.\n\nAnd now we get to other aspects (I usually don't care about graphics; I just see if gameplay can hook me in). Thank god because this game doesn't have the level up thing which was in the last game. Sure, it was nice at first but it got very frustrating after some time. Also, I have to mention this game has a very nice and polished port and there's a high chance you can get it to run even on older PCs. Now about the final boss (Takemizukachi if I'm not mistaken). This REALLY reminded me of Guilty Gear Isuka somehow (I really don't know why); and it was brilliantly BAD! Why? It changed positions 5 TIMES IN A ROW so I was constantly running from side to side! How I'm supposed to enjoy fighting it this way?\n\nPROS:\n- Optimized for PC. You can play this game without problems\n- Great story mode (Like always)\n- Great offline/single player content\n- Fast and challenging gameplay\n- Very nice tutorial mode\n- Music remixes are mostly done well\n- GREAT English voice acting\n\nCONS:\n- Final boss.\n- Some of the musics are not very good and you probably finish the match before hearing their best parts (This happened for me against Iron Tager).\n- There's a glitch in the game that makes it to display incorrectly and out of bounds. This only happens if you close the steam client's window shortly before game launches and is temporary.\n- IS THERE ANY POSSIBLE WAY TO BEAT UNLIMITED MARS MODE?!\n- Other problems that I wasn't able to spot yet...\n\nVERDICT:\nYou like fighting games? You like great story modes? You want a learn fast, difficult to master gameplay? You want enough single player content?\nIf your answer is YES, then buy this game and you will not be disappointed!\n\nNow if you excuse me, I'm going to play it some more... Oh, and I maybe update this later...","March 11","true","39.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It's like every single aspect of this masterpiece tells us that the game was created with love.\n\nThe only mentionable downside is the outdated video quality (rendering at lower resolution). But seriously, I would probably play this game even if it looked like the ancient Prince of Persia.\n\nWith that said, it's time to announce the final verdict: 10/10 would instabuy again\n\nP.S.: Srsly Arcsys? You have outdone yourself with Amane. I nearly fell for your trap.","March 3","true","128.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","75","3","4","3","0"

So even if you are not the best at the stick if you are looking for intregue in a story rich universe you might give it a bash. However there are a few short comings in this age.\n\nThe Mixed bag:\n\nIt is a console port so some limitations are expected. The problem is when you no longer adhere to the once console limits of 1080p and cross into the realm of 1440p, 4k, ultrawide, 100hz+ refresh rates you will be disappointed to find that the game is upscaled from 720p60fps. It looks very dated for more reasons than just this fact.\n\nThe game uses beaulifully and detailed sprite animations and the effort is clearly visiable as each character feel. That said it was still designed with a low res in mind with no high detailed models and down sampling. The other thing to take note of is that Guilty Gear Xrd was released not too long ago sporting full poly models making even 1080p look managable and frankly giving the characters more depth.\n\nThe story mode will be the meat for those not into the competitive scene yet unlike BB CS it does not contrain the previous story modes. You will have to get both Continuum Shift and Chronophantasma if you want to see where we are and how we got to this point.\n\nCharacter design and backstory really shines as certain characters will have different face off chatter to the norm under cerstain conditions. This adds to the feel that the characters know each other and has a deeper connection.\n\nIf you can forgive the lack of catering to newer specced PCs but want more of the BB universe or just a fighting game with a deep story mode, then Chronophantasma is worth a look.","March 2","true","1.4"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","4","6","2","3"

BlazBlue: Cronophantasma Extend is, of course the sequel to the game BlazBlue: Continum Shift. Just the  "Extend" version from the original Cronophantasma that released only for PS3, adding the dlc character for free and tweaking characters. To start, this is a very stable port. Online netcode seems to be improved over CS's net code, the annoying memory leak that plauged CS is gone as well. How ever the game lack resolution selections,sorry guys no 1080p here, but suprisingly it works to the games advantage, as upscaling would require a redrawing of all game sprites, as everything is hand drawn, well at least the characters are not the backgrounds. The story is, back and longer than ever, however don;t expect to be doing much fghting in the story, its a visual novel in the story mode with very little fights, also be warned, the story is complex, not kingdom hearts complex but complex none the less, I highly reccomend you play the stories of the iother blazblue games. Online mode is here too, suprisingly they did away with the old room system and brought in a new "literal" room that you can decorate, using "money" you earn in game through all game modes, except training that is, it's a neat idea, but you are unable to see your connection with anyone who joins, like you could in other BlazBlue games. The music is the best it's been in the entire series, and fits right in with the old themes of the characters! The art is fantastic as well, and gameplay is smooth and more polished this time around. Character balance is the best it's been in the series, however on that note online fights in ranked are scarce, sadly this is not a popular game, so the player base is very low, so spread the word!\n\nNumber rating if you want it:  8/10\n\nBest feature: Story\n\nWorst Feature: Revamped online "rooms"\n\nIf you like fighters, this is a must!","March 15","true","143.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

So as a player of all the other BB games before this one I have to say at first I ♥♥♥♥ing hated this game.  They changed a LOOOOOOOOOOOOOT.  Like, characters don't even play remotely the same 'a lot'.  Examples being Taokaka not having a lot of the same combo start ups/combos like 6a>whatever or <insert specific throw combo here>.  But that said, the game grew on me and I have to say it is rather, not bad, but really good.  There are a lot of characters and the combos are still fun and because there are a lot of new combos they are also fresh.  Low tier characters like Tager from CT and CS have their chance to shine in this game as they are A tier now (I hate you Tager >:C).  The balance is overall pretty good.\n\nOnly real downside is we still don't have the CT system voice...that really was the only (in my opinion) good announcer.  Hate all the new ones, although admittedly I haven't tried all the character announcer voices (but I am pretty sure I can imagine how they sound).\n\n8/10, hope to see Central Fiction on Steam soon (it's fun in Arcade!)","May 17","true","31.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Arc System Works, with the Blazblue series and the Guilty Gear series, they own two of the few great fighting games there are.\n\nLove Combos? Love action packed games? Love getting your ♥♥♥ kicked by people online? This is the game for you.\n\nNot much of a fighting guy, but enjoy it casually? Don't worry, the more deeper we go into the Blazblue series the more it becomes a Visual Novel. The game has such a great story, with plot twists here and there. Even though it's the third game in the story, it managed to fill you in if you've missed out on the previous games.\n\nPros?:\n\n- Action Packed Story.\n\n- Fun fighting casually and competitive\n\n- Has a great netcode if you ever manage to find someone online\n\n- Celica A. Mercury, probably the best character ever to be added into a franchise.\n\n- No pay for DLC, it's all in the game, Kokonoe as well!\n\n- Kokonoe has probably been the character everyone wanted implemented into the game, and here she is!\n\nCons?:\n\n- Even if it has a great netcode, it still sort of feels unplayable when playing online with someone distant, say continents apart.\n\n- If you were an avid player of the originals, movesets were changed, rather, added on, and that definitely makes it a bit harder to relearn all the mechanics\n\n- Not being able to play with console players, this sucks because the online community here is almost never on.\n\nTL;DR:\n\n- The game's great, and if you enjoy fighting games, but don't want it to really interrupt the story it has that, and then there's a whole bunch of fighting modes for you to play.\n\n- Kokonoe Mercury and Celica A. Mercury\n\n- Tsubaki's costume color changed, but that's alright.\n\n- Noel got a new costume and it looks nice.","March 26","true","34.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Buy the game already!\nThis is without a doubt the most polished BlazBlue you can get right now, and it's not even a full priced game (thank the lord)\nFor PC users this is finaly a chance to get into Blazblue with a huge character roster. The new characters are all realy unique and bring a totaly new playstyle to the game. The story might be a little hard to get into this late in the series, but you could always read about everything that happend before in the Library if you realy wanted to.\n\nI'm also realy pleased that the character colours and announcer voices etc. aren't paid DLC anymore. You can now unlock these with points that you get for just playing the game.\n\nThe only realy big downside to me at the moment is that there's barely anyone online on the PC version.\nSo here's hoping you'll all start buying this game and come online for some epic battles :D","March 2","true","6.4"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","53","8","15","5","0"

I think the recovery time's gotten a bit shorter.\nA lot of the characters got huge changes done to them. Jin for example became insanely different.\nThere's a lot of new characters in the game, too. (Lots!)\nI'm not sure which to recommend for a first timer CPEX or CSEX. CSEX is really good and some characters are more defined and work better there. Might be slower and easier to understand.\nThis game runs very well and neatly. Looks pretty.\n\nHopefully the communities for both games grow and get big!\nI'd hate to see CSEX abandoned.\n\n\nEDIT!!!\nThis game is so fantastic. It has such insane depth. Extremely entertaining. Unlocking things by winning ingame points from the matches is very fun. (The unlocks are just colors, music, backgrounds, art, Unlimited Versions.)\nYou definitely won't be able to unlock everything with just 10 hours of of play, but you can choose the things you like best and work up from there.\nI love how much they put into the game, there's the old music and backgrounds from previous games you can unlock and that just is so caring.","March 3","true","39.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

AT LEAST THE GAME'S ON PC AT LAST! ABOUT GOD DAMN TIME!!!\n\nEDIT: After playing for some time, yet to enter online, I have not encountered ANY problems at all until now. My only problem is facing against Tager because he is a ♥♥♥♥... Grapple and destroy in a few seconds, that jerk... >:/ Oh, works on both my laptop with GT930 and my gaming rig with GTX960, both runs perfectly.\n\n2ND EDIT: I tried online once, got destroyed by some Japanese guy I assume, and it's not horrendously laggy, but my internet isn't good to begin with anyway, so I can't talk much about online battles.\n\n3RD EDIT: Alright, after finishing the whole damn story mode, I can finally talk about the game itself for I do not own this on my PS3 and I did not spoil my story or whatsoever so I had a blind play. The story is great and if you've played Calamity Trigger and Continuum Shift before, you would have noticed that the story is much more straightforward now. No more purposely dying for a new route and no need to purposely do distortion drives or something. The normal and joke routes are very obvious and are very entertaining to watch. This is the first time I can feel myself loving the characters in the Blazblue series aside from liking Ragna beating the crap out of everyone. I began respecting Kagura although he can be a jerk. I liked how Noel has evolved from a wimp into, somewhat stronger girl. I liked how Jin could finally stop being a 100% jerk like in CT and CS, though he's still a jerk... And yeah, I actually liked it when Kagura made a stand and I love how all of the villains can be top level jerks to the point where I hate all of them, which is good because that's how villains should be. I'd recommend this game to casuals easily because not only it's a serious fighting game, you can get yourself into story mode and get like, I don't know, I have 30 hours of gameplay already?","March 2","true","102.6"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","3","6","0","0"

The tutorials also help anyone new to the game or fighters, great for newcomers and fighters. If you are looking into fighters and are new to the series I suggest you get this one. Since you will get all of the other previous fighters who were not available until now.

Again, some character got much more specials than the others do.\n\nIt got more of strategy than CoH2 even now, expanded up to date. If you need to know, I've got standing around 150-300 in 1v1 and 61-200 on 2v2 with random teammates.

Need to try out the new characters more.\n\nAt the time of writing I've played for only 19 minutes and it was awesome. I first started playing Blazblue with Blazblur Continuum shift on Xbox 360. When I got CSE on my labtop(which isn't all that powerful.) I was slightly disappointed with the frame rate(going from a low of 35 during astrals or in abyss mode with +50 speed characters to a high of 58-60(which I'm more then happy just getting 45 fps.) Blazblue Chronophantasma extend has maintains a frame rate of 60 fps most of the time during my 19 minutes of play only dropping durin astrals and even then it wasn't jumpy at all. This was the only thing that bothered me on CSE so I'm happy its running so well.\n\nPros\nI think the characters are either more responsive due to the better frame rate I'm having, improvements by Arc system or I might just be a little shocked at how fast ragna felt compared to cse.\n\nBalance changes are usually good for me and I noticed some basic combos that I usually use with ragna did a bit more damage. I'm happy to see my main get some love from Arc system.\n\nCharacter roster is a nice improvement I'm really happy to see so many new characters(I'm even looking forward to beating the **** out of Terumi with ragna.)\n\nI didn't expect to see the old songs, maps(backrounds?) to be included which is a great bonus for me.\n\nIt was on sales I got it for a great price I didn't expect that I would be able to even get this game for months.\n\nAll the dlc is included with some bonus goodies..... Love seeing that on pc.\n\nCons....\n\nI'm down to less then $2 in my steam account..... I couldn't care less about that. :)\n\nBlazblue/10=AWESOME!!!!","March 5","true","65.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This game is really good if you're looking for a air-dashy fighting game.  I haven't touched the story mode at all, I've just been playing versus and training mode.  Taokaka, Makoto, and Terumi best characters.  Basically I like this game, a lot.  Plenty of characters with varying play-styles (besides like two or three characters being very similar).\n\nThe only issue I have with this game is that Online mode feels dead.  Maybe its just me, but everytime I go to play online, there's only ever like one or two people to fight, and you end up fighting eachother over and over until one of you desides to stop playing.  It either will be super laggy, they'll spam, or they'll just be better then you.  I can't say anything about with friends, because none of my friends currently own the game.\n\nIts a good game, but with a online mode thats not really good with randoms.","April 10","true","7.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/moon_madness/recommended/388750/","moon_madness","Moonmadness","http://steamcommunity.com/id/moon_madness/","145 products in account","Well, I'm pretty embarrassed while writing this review because I don't know if I would recommend this game or not.\nLet's put it this way: if you're fan of Japanese visual novels/anime, then you would still be as pleased as with the previous BlazBlue games. The story is not quite as good as CT or CS but it is decent enough to keep you interested until the end.\nThe game offers a lot of single player modes like Arcade, Abyss, Score Attack or the fight against a special boss (I won't spoil what it is) and there are many reports of it having a pretty good netcode for online play. And finally, the game doesn't seem to have many major issues running on PC.\n\nNow... the bad news:\n- This is just a PC port of the PS3 version which keeps the arcade proportions. Sprites and menus are set to 720p and look extremely ugly and pixelated on higher resolutions. Compatibility sits therefore very uncomfortably between gaming PCs who are too advanced to display it properly and toasters who can't display it at all. It is still playable but... yuck.\n- The gameplay. Ok, I know, this is a matter of taste, you either like air-dashers or not blahblah, but I cannot help but find that the BB series has taken a path made of an increasing number of complicated mechanics which are too much for many gamers' minds to take a hold of: Rapid Cancel, Crush Trigger, Counter Assault, Burst, Overdrive, Barrier Block, Instant Block... You can clearly see this game was made in a time when SF4 was still a thing and adding gimmicks to escape or invert any situation was still seen as cool. They know very well they screwed up and that's why they added Stylish mode since CS, which is in my eyes just an acknowledgement of failure in creating an accessible game.\nAs for the game tutorials, while they are better than CSE ones (particularly the character tutorials) they sadly still look as they were written by fighting game nerds so deeply immersed in their own vocabulary that they aren't aware of the existence of an outside world. Reading an online guide is far less tedious and more practical than going through this.\n\nSo I would say, if you're interested in good anime-styled single player content, this can be the game for you. If you happen to be part of the very specific niche who likes technical air-dashers and wanna play online with other enthousiasts of the genre... then you probably already own this game and don't need my advice.\nBut if you wanna get into fighting other people online and offline, be aware that this game may not be a very welcoming and forgiving experience. The player base is extremely small (I can never find more than 10-15 people in online lobbies a week after launch) and there's a high chance your opponent will be a BB veteran with no compassion for newbies.\n\nI'll give a negative review because it has so many good reviews it won't be counted anyway, and to get downvoted as much as possible.","March 7","false","17.1"," 12 of 46 people (26%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","26","12","46","4","0"

I honestly do.\n\nThe problem is the online experience, which is what most people expect to be decent if they're buying a fighting game. To be blunt, it's complete and utter garbage. It still uses outdated netcode, and there's, even at launch, a small population of players online. So finding matches that aren't extremely delayed is very, very hard.\n\nOn top of this, damn near everyone playing is extremely experienced at the series if not this specific game. If you're a new player, you have absolutely no chance at competing, and the game is full of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s that taunt when they beat you and crash rooms specifically labled "newbie" or "noob" with whatever they main and proceed to just combo you up a wall constantly. Some of them sandbag, but never for long because once you start winning they always show you just how much of a smurfing ♥♥♥♥♥♥ they are.\n\nThe end result of this is that if you bought this game for the single player, it's... Well, it's decent. But if you bought it for the multiplayer as most people do, and you're not part of the small community of players who've been playing since the start... Well, it's going to be a very unpleasant time. You're going to find nothing but lag and people with hundreds if not thousands of hours of experience at the game.\n\nIf you want an Arcsys fighter, all I can say is look elsewhere towards Xrd, especially as most of the console players who came over to PC to stomp newbies have moved back to console. The game is also more forgiving with inputs and there's a larger average player community, so if you're new you're going to have an easier time.","March 3","false","11.1"," 14 of 69 people (20%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","20","14","69","7","8"

ASW finally anwsered our prays and was it worth it? defineldy. I'd say it goes far beyond that actually.\n\nNow let me start this by saying: i am NOT an anime fan, in fact i dislike majority of it, its just not my thing ok? However both Blazblue and Guilty gear are those special roses for me and i do indeed mean this when i say i personally think Blazblue is the greatest anime of all time, i'm sure everyone disagrees and feel free to, it's just an opinion of mine.\nWith that said lets start with the gameplay shall we?\n\nNow if youre a veteran of fighting games in general your first thoughts might be that its a standard 2D fighter and...youre kinda right. Blazblue is your classic 2D 1v1 fighting game polished to its core BUT it has the Drive button wich is unique to every character and ill avoid major detail but i'll say it really seperates each character from one another, but it makes it harder to master more than one character. all and all the core gameplay of blazblue is perfectly polished with added new ideas that thankfully work\n\nDespite being a fighter blazblues actual main selling point indeed is the story and i'll say this right now: I absolutely LOVE the characters and story, you might think most of them are just stereotypes but play the game and have these "stereotypes" get tossed all around and made fun of. Blazblue has some of the most memorable characters i've ever seen. My personal favourites being Ragna, Makoto and of course Hazama/Terumi in all his glory. now I would go deeper into the story but its best to be experienced by yourself and i don't want to spoil anything, just a heads-up: this story and lore while large and amazing can be really confusing to newcomers and even more experienced players at times. my only nitpick with the story is that i can't stand seeing the imperator more times than my brain can handle, i'm sorry but shes one of the worst villain excuses i've ever seen ESPECIALLY when we already got Hazama/Terumi whos one of the most brilliant villains i've seen in a long time and is so good of a troll he puts hades crying in a corner, but that's just me.\n\nI suppose the only thing i really need to talk about anymore is the online mode.\nuh...i suppose it's good, honestly it works just fine and has plenty of things to do, however what kills it is that theres not many players playing. It's not really the games fault now is it? You can still find people playing it and most of the time they are nice people, but you'll have to search for a while.\n\nWell then time to score this game, before i get into this i'll make it clear: this game wont appeal for everyone. if youre not a fan of fighters, anime and long stories, you propably wont enjoy Chronophantasma, but who knows? You might be suprised, i'm not a big fighting game fan, i dislike anime, yet here I am giving Blazblue Chronophantasma Extend a\n9.5/10\nYes, this game is really that good. I could go on and on about the characters, lore, one of the greatest soundtracks in a video game and so on and i highly recommend you give it a try, however blazblue is sadly extremely underrated, it's alongside Dissidia Duodecim as a fantastic game but it's completely in the shadows of games like street fighter and super smash bros, despite it being several leauges better.\n\nI guess that's all I have to say, have a good day.","March 12","true","62.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DRGT/recommended/388750/","DRGT","Your Lord and Savior DRGT","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DRGT/","126 products in account","It will be a review made by complete n00b in fighting games. I've warned you.\n\nI had a little romance with games like Tekken, Mortal Combat or King of Fighters, but as I said it was just a romance. If we are talking about BlazBlue franchise, then I can clearly tell, that I'm in love.\nGaming Warlocks from Arc System certainly knows how to make good games. They even know how to make sequels far greater than previous games! That's just incredible!\n\nIt's hard for me to tell what changed between Continuum Shift and ChronoPhantasma in terms of gameplay (aside from removing Golden Break Bursts, Guard Primers, quicken gameplay a bit, adding Overdrive and replacing Guard Crush with Crush Trigger), but what I'm certain is fact, that combos and special attacks are easier to preform than before. I'm not sure if It's just me becoming pro or something really changed, but mentioning it won't hurt.\n\nAI is finally intelligent and in every mode (except most fights in story mode) it's giving a little chalange to battle them. At least if you are n00b like me.\n\nNow it's time for PLOT! <insert image with boobs here>\nToshimichi Mori serve us again extremly deep, multi-threaded history with TONS of hard to understand things, termology that normally wouldn't had any sense etc. but if you enjoyed story so far, then you will be in heaven. Now story isn't presented from the perspective of a certain character, so you don't need to complete history by fighting as character you don't like...\nAt least not that much as in previous games. (BTW. screw you Hakumen!)\nPlot is very enjoyable if you like this kind of stories, but there is one controversial thing about, how it is presented. Most people is probably accustomed to a little bit of story, then text, then story, then again fight and so on. ChronoPhantasma have a diffrent proportions from previous games. There is A LOT of text (with kind of funny animations with sprites reminding me of a certain indie game), then a short fight with character being main character at the moment, then again a WALL of text, then again short fight, short cutscene and again TEXT.\nPlease, don't misunderstand me. I've enjoyed this story much more than before and for me this proportions made story much more captivating than in CT and CS, but for many people it will be one of the cons of this game.\n\nOk. Are you still reading? Yes? Oh. I must say, I'm impressed by your endurance! Stay a bit more and there will be your awaited end. Not your end of course.\n\nSo, where I left? Oh right! Soundtrack. I have a mixed feelings about it. Most songs from previous games was remade and/or remixed and sometimes they are a lot better than original (e.g Sword of Doom II or Bullet Dance II) but there are songs that is kind of worse than before (e.g Awakening a Chaos II or Xmatic II). Then again, don't misunderstand me. These which for me is worse than original, isn't bad. Just... they aren't fitting my taste anymore. Still, Daisuke Ishiwatari done a great job.\n\nVisuals are pretty as always and still they have this old school arcade feeling. In my opinion, green and colorful Ikaruga gave designers a great range for making stages even more beautiful than before! About characters... I don't think, that something changed between CS and CP, but new Noel's outfit looks great on her.\n\nNow it's time for some cons. Like in Continuum Shift, port from consoles isn't great. You can't find here FullHD support, there few problems with some PC configurations and scalling here is quite bad. But I must tell, I don't really care. Game is great and this port is still better than that of Arkham Knight (lol). If you like fighting games and deep story, then hurry up and buy it!\n\nK'ay. Now we are waiting another 2 or more years for continuation. Eh... Whatever. Gotta go to kick Jin's ♥♥♥ for calling my favorite character a trash.\nOh. Did I mentioned that this game ends with big and fatty cliffhanger? :>","March 7","true","47.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

ASW finally anwsered our prays and was it worth it? defineldy. I'd say it goes far beyond that actually.\n\nNow let me start this by saying: i am NOT an anime fan, in fact i dislike majority of it, its just not my thing ok? However both Blazblue and Guilty gear are those special roses for me and i do indeed mean this when i say i personally think Blazblue is the greatest anime of all time, i'm sure everyone disagrees and feel free to, it's just an opinion of mine.\nWith that said lets start with the gameplay shall we?\n\nNow if youre a veteran of fighting games in general your first thoughts might be that its a standard 2D fighter and...youre kinda right. Blazblue is your classic 2D 1v1 fighting game polished to its core BUT it has the Drive button wich is unique to every character and ill avoid major detail but i'll say it really seperates each character from one another, but it makes it harder to master more than one character. all and all the core gameplay of blazblue is perfectly polished with added new ideas that thankfully work\n\nDespite being a fighter blazblues actual main selling point indeed is the story and i'll say this right now: I absolutely LOVE the characters and story, you might think most of them are just stereotypes but play the game and have these "stereotypes" get tossed all around and made fun of. Blazblue has some of the most memorable characters i've ever seen. My personal favourites being Ragna, Makoto and of course Hazama/Terumi in all his glory. now I would go deeper into the story but its best to be experienced by yourself and i don't want to spoil anything, just a heads-up: this story and lore while large and amazing can be really confusing to newcomers and even more experienced players at times. my only nitpick with the story is that i can't stand seeing the imperator more times than my brain can handle, i'm sorry but shes one of the worst villain excuses i've ever seen ESPECIALLY when we already got Hazama/Terumi whos one of the most brilliant villains i've seen in a long time and is so good of a troll he puts hades crying in a corner, but that's just me.\n\nI suppose the only thing i really need to talk about anymore is the online mode.\nuh...i suppose it's good, honestly it works just fine and has plenty of things to do, however what kills it is that theres not many players playing. It's not really the games fault now is it? You can still find people playing it and most of the time they are nice people, but you'll have to search for a while.\n\nWell then time to score this game, before i get into this i'll make it clear: this game wont appeal for everyone. if youre not a fan of fighters, anime and long stories, you propably wont enjoy Chronophantasma, but who knows? You might be suprised, i'm not a big fighting game fan, i dislike anime, yet here I am giving Blazblue Chronophantasma Extend a\n9.5/10\nYes, this game is really that good. I could go on and on about the characters, lore, one of the greatest soundtracks in a video game and so on and i highly recommend you give it a try, however blazblue is sadly extremely underrated, it's alongside Dissidia Duodecim as a fantastic game but it's completely in the shadows of games like street fighter and super smash bros, despite it being several leauges better.\n\nI guess that's all I have to say, have a good day.","March 12","true","62.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/acrookedman/recommended/388750/","acrookedman","、WiZE","http://steamcommunity.com/id/acrookedman/","25 products in account","I'll just be straightforward. Everything about this game is great. History, gameplay, artwork, soundtrack, waifus...\nThe only sad thing is that its online mode is painfully dead. The matches you'll find will be probably laggy as ♥♥♥♥, and you will play against the same person for hours until you find another room.\n\nDon't expect an easy and/or simple game. BlazBlue brings to the table A LOT of things that are different from other fighting games. A majority of the characters will not work well with spamming and mashing buttons, and the comboes in this game are not easy to do, too. Expect a lot of microdashes, different types of command grabs, guards (and ways to break it), playstyles, insane comebacks, etc.\nAnd finally, the better part: Even the weakest characters in this game can be useful and viable. It's very balanced. You can always win, even when playing a counterpicked, weak character.\n\nWorth the money. Play this game.\n\nPS: Can't wait for the Centralfiction port.  Arc System pls.","May 20","true","96.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Actually, for this reason the storymode is simply inaccesible for me. The strange thing is that, if I try to run the Movies "out of the game" and using VLC, selecting them directly from their folder, they work properly. (???). But when they are activated in-game, both the opening and all the Movies caw and leap up every 2 seconds. If someone could help me with this issue, I'd be very grateful.\n\nOther points down:\n- the sound effects were far better in BBCSE. Here the developers have decreased the impact of punches and kicks, and of many special moves of various characters. (For example, all Jin Kisaragi ice attacks);\n- there is no Score calculator during Arcade Mode, and the game doen't explain how you have earned the money you gain defeating enemies. Again, in BBCSE all of this stuff was done very well so I don't understand the reason why here it is so vague.\n\nComing to the positive things, we have:\n+ new mechanics (the Overdrive is the GREATEST idea here);\n+ new characters (and many of them - like Amane & Celica - are really WONDERFUL);\n+ excellent variety (and quality) about environments.\n\nFor now, although I'm really displeased telling this, I cannot fully promote this game. :-( For me, it is "Movie broken" and with half of the contents not enjoyable.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSUPPLEMENT TO THE OLD REVIEW\n\nOK: after 170 hours of gameplay, I have to admit that, overall, this game is really GREAT!\n\nHere are the reasons for my change of opinion:\n+++ all the new Charcaters are very funny and well differentiated;\n+++ Abyss Mode is really amazing, far better then in the previous Chapter, because here you have 10 independent paths to complete (the same for every Character, but each Character has its personal results) and when you buy an item it is forever (while on Continuum Shift you have to buy it everytime you want to use it);\n+++ I enjoyed very much the main Campaign, although I was forced everytime there was a Movie to exit the game and play it manually from the Game Folder (my damned "cinematics issue" isn't still solved);\n+++ I'm glad that the next Blazblue Game will be the last, and end this wonderful Saga, because when someone makes infinite a series there is often a drastic fall of quality and the series itself ends to be spoiled. VERY IMPORTANT: please, create a good ending! Don't ruin this Saga with a  precipitant and approximate finish.","March 2","true","187.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","6"

Still I was going into this game blind, having last played the previous BlazBlue title (Continuum Shift Extend) in February of last year, so my skills were rather rusty. Thankfully, my best character was still on the roaster (That being Taokaka) and I managed to blunder my way through several battles in Arcade mode on the games default settings, which is more of a testament to the games controls being very responsive, and with 'practice' one could easily manhandle the game on it's default settings.\n\nSo onto how does the game looks... well it looks gorgeous. As a 2D fighter, the amount of detail a game has in the background is plus without it being a distraction. The characters themselves are all rather colorful, if some of the human female characters look rather impractical with attire and proportions. But that's pretty standard with fighting games, and also one of the best things about them. Anyway as you can see, everything is laid out in a traditional format, with the Health Bars at the top and the 'power meters' down at the bottom of the screen.\n\nOnto the sound, and one of the great things about the BlazBlue series is the voice acting is very decent (if at times a bit repetitive, but I'm one to talk), the sound effects are solid with the impact they deliver. Then there is the music, which like a lot of songs for Anime adventure series, have a way of sounding epic and grand while not distracting the player. It blends in perfectly to the background, you know its there, you hear it, but it isn't drawing your attention away from the task at hand, which is playing the game and hoping for a win.\n\nThe game has a roster of 28 characters, so there is a lot of replay value for wanting to go through the story and arcade modes to see and unlock everything. Old favorites like Carl Clover, Noel Vermillion,and Bang Shishigami are back, plus new comers like Bullet, Azarel and Amane Nishiki help bring new challenges.\n\nThere is a score attack, online play and other secondary features that help keep this game at the forefront of 2D fighters on the PC until the next BlazBlue port comes around in a couple of years for Central Fiction\n\nMy recommendation: For $29.99 the price is pretty reasonable, because you are getting the complete game with all the DLC at once shot. So the value is there if you're looking for a 2D-Fighter from a 'franchise' for your PC collection.","April 24","true","26.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I can't believe that I slept on this fighter for years. A game of this caliber should never over shadowed by other fighters such as MKX(not saying that mortal kombat isn't a good fighter but NRS needs to do better!). Ok, I'm not into the whole storyline which is cringe worthy IMO. However, the gameplay is amazing. Imagine MVC2/UMVC3 without the Marvel comics license and the silly assist spamming. Well, there are characters in this game that have assist-like (or puppet master/summoner) abilities but anyways its a 1v1 fighter at its best.\n\nPlenty of different modes including a full visual/audio storyline and arcade mode for casuals and for new people to the series ONE OF THE BEST IN-GAME TUTORIAL MODES THAT I'VE SEEN IN ANY FIGHTING GAME PERIOD!

There is literally a character for all styles (Currently play Azreal and the Wolf dude).\n\nWhat I don't like is the lack of players in the network mode finding a match in ranking is next to impossible at times which again WHY ALL PC FIGHTING GAMES SHOULD HAVE CROSS-PLAY CONSOLE PLAYERS. Granted that the BBCPEX community is very small when compared to the SF and MKX which it make it much more important for Arc System to take heeve to what Capcom and Iron Galaxy did with Cross-play. Sadly, in a few months, the new version of this game will drop on consoles which this version came out 3 years ago.
