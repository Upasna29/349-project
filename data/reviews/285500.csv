It's very similar to the Wing Commander : Privateer model of a golden path where you have an open world, horizontal gameplay and character development with a game story waiting for you to follow it.\n\nThere's trading, truck upgrades, modular weapons, towns, factions, and an open world map to boot.  The graphics are 2006-ish but if you're looking for gameplay, you can look past that.\n\nThe vehicles themselves are based around chassis that have stats but each chassis also has multiple front and back body components which different turret / upgrade / cargo slots.   Not all weapon slots are 360 degrees which adds a positional element to combat.\n\nThe game won't work out of the box for Windows 7.  You have to delete the videos in your Steam\SteamApps\common\Hard Truck Apocalypse\data\video directory.","March 15, 2014","true","55.1"," 173 of 189 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","173","189","0","0"

It's like a mix of Twisted Metal, Fallout, and Mad-Max style combat with a huge amount of cheesey- and probably bad- translations. It's a Russian game with dated graphics and a decently written story. It's a tale of revenge, messenger-like objectives, and mystery. The lore is actually really complex, and there are some side quests you can take more than the random Bartender mission. Yeah, those guys give you random missions that help early game but are wastes of time in later game due to the prices.\nNow, I find it funny that every character wears a Ghost-of-the-opera-esque mask, and lore-wise they explain they're basically a more ornate and compacted Gas mask. I think they made them because they didn't want to have to animate faces, haha. Voice acting is absurd in English; so you may want to just play it in the original Russian with subtitles. This game still has its problems.\n\nPros:\n-Excellent Story and Lore\n-Wonderful control system; works pretty well and can be re-assigned if need be.\n-Interesting Mechanics- Fuel is a thing, tons of truck upgrades, pretty unique storage system.\n-Design of the trucks looks amazing; You even get monstrosities that are crosses between monstertrucks and tanks, wield five guns at once, and guzzle gas faster than five hummers from an oil tank that must be the size of a pond.\n-A few hillarious glitches: Pedestrians walk into your truck during cutscenes and splat with a noise like a bug, grass floats, that sort of thing.\n\nCons:\n-Dated Graphics; it's an old game, but that can be looked over.\n-A few major glitches; One game breaking one stopped me from palying for nearly a year until I found a guide. Careful when you get to the oil shiping mission in the desert.\n-Gets boring at times- you'll spend sometimes an hour or more crossing over three regions that you've cleared before, one-shotting the old enemies and getting worthless crap.\n-AI can be a bit of an idiot at times; crashs into enemies, drives off of cliffs, gets stuck on debris.\n\nAll in all, I would suggest this game. It's enjoyable and very, very unique- plus it gives me a laugh every now and then, even if it wasn't intended. I'm pretty sure they weren't; but it's funny when a bandit yells something nonsensical anyways. If you want a game of strange bandits, amazing truck combat, massive- and sometimes excellent- landscapes, amazing story, and silly translations, BUY THIS GAME. It's worth it.","April 22, 2015","true","21.9"," 36 of 36 people (100%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","100","36","36","4","0"

Ex Machina is one of those games, but let me start off by saying that this game certainly isn't for everyone, it's genre is considered to be a very acquired taste, but I would say it's worth the buy anyway just for the sake of trying it. I didn't expect it to be anything amazing given it's lack of popularity, but I was wrong, this game is truly brilliant.\nIf by some coincidence you were attracted to this game because you are a fan of Takara's Road Trip Adventure or Seek & Destroy (otherwise known as the ChoroQ games) like me, then you definitely shouldn't miss out on this, it brings the best of both of those Worlds together!\n\nEx Machina is about the young protagonist searching for lots of answers & vengeance, depending on the story options you go along with, in a post apocalyptic representation of north America. You start off with one of the weaker vehicles in the game but are given the oportunity to work your way up the ladder by getting coins for doing jobs or selling loot and scrap to people and villages thus giving you the chance to buy new vehicles or upgrade your existing one. Sell the dropped weapons of the enemy, use the money to buy yourself a bigger, better one! The game starts off a little bit slow, but the pace picks up over the course of the game.\nNot much else can be said without giving away spoilers, but the story can be very extensive depending on what choices you make during your experience, this is something I really enjoy about Ex Machina, that there isn't just one set plot but rather multiple different routes and storylines that can occur.\n\nThe game has it's quirks, in fact, it is a very quirky game, it also has some minor annoyances such as some spelling and grammatical mistakes (this is due to the original version of the game being Russian resulting in a bad translation). The voice acting leaves much to be desired and the dialog is sometimes far from brilliant, but this game really does a lot more things right than it does wrong. The open world, the long story with alternate endings and plots, tons of optional quests, upgrades and weapon variety are something many games in this day and age can learn from. It really is a shame that this game doesn't have a very large community because it really is wonderful, even if it has somewhat dated graphics. There is also no warp function, meaning you have to drive to everywhere you need to go rather than magically appearing there with the click of a button, this can sometimes be tedious but is also another great addition to this open world game.\n\nIf you've been watching this, I highly recommend giving it a go, I can't promise you will enjoy it because as I said above, it definitely isn't for everybody, but it is certainly something unique. Some of the reviews on here and the "expert" reviews on other sites seem to be by people who tried the game for all of 20 minutes and decided to stop playing for some reason or other as they never go into any detail as to why they gave negative reviews, so I think rather than thinking twice because of what those people had to say, you should just ultimately see for yourself. That's what I did, I have no regrets.\n\nPlease do read some reviews however as it seems that this game has some trouble functioning on certain systems. I am running Windows 8 and the game runs flawlessly.","November 3, 2014","true","57.7"," 37 of 42 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","37","42","0","0"

I'd like to point out some pros and cons for the game, and you guys will judge for yourself.\n\nI solemnly swear to keep it spoiler-free for those who still hasn't finished it.\n\nPros:\n* A pseudo open world to explore. Due to some scripted restrictions you cannot simly go to, say, Vaterland from Krai. But it doens't mean that actual exploration is not fun and to some extent rewarding.\n* A variety of trucks to choose from with a great deal of customization. I love all of them, except for maybe Belaz since I didin't touch it at all.\n* A wide variety of weapons to satisfy anyone's taste, from machine guns to plasma cannons.\n* Lovely soundtrack and visuals. A bit outdated, but the game is almost a decade old! Explosions and energy particles tho.\n* The narrative in terms of lore. Just read the in-game books.\n\nCons:\n* Extremely poor narrative. Both from the point of telling a story and the story itself. I dunno, maybe it's just those Masks that make every character to look the same way? Or voice acting? Or the final which is a HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT?\n* A dumb AI. More in a matter of path-finding than fighting. Extremely stupid! Sometimes a bunch of trucks cannot make it through a hill because instead of driving around they try to come over it.\n* Not really much stuff to do aside from some interesting side quests now and then.\n*  The final boss battle. A huge disappointment also. No spoilers!\n* Dialogue is just a stub. I understand that in such a mission there need to be less talk and more action but damn! I felt sorry for coming to Ben's place and leaving the same instance without even saying good bye. No love for the old guy.\n* Restrictions on where to go and what to do. Try to cross that river in Vaterland. Just go and do it.\n* Some things are just unnecessary. For example, some inter-regional shortcuts. I never used them and have a feeling that never will. Sad but true.\n\nCONLUSION: This game has it's flaws, and narrative leaves a nasty touch on my tongue. But I still love this game. For the sense of freedom that it managed to give to me despite all those restrictions to go where I want. For the atmosphere of post-apocalyptic road to nowhere. You just go where the wind blows. I just wish I could dive into this world a bit more, leaving all that main storyline somewhere on the side. Actually, a sandbox open-world RPG in HTA setting would be much appreciated and would become a must-have in my collection. Maybe with some neat multiplayer like it was, say, in Freelancer? I don't know, and probably will never know.\n\nAnyway, that's my review. Still love this game and recommend it to everyone interested. Give this game a try.","May 23, 2014","true","62.3"," 35 of 39 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","35","39","0","6"

If you are prepared for that, then please continue reading... or better yet, just BUY the thing already. It's a great game! If not, then unfortuneately it will never work for you and your money would be best spent somewhere else. There WILL be an MMO version of this game by the same developers, and it's currently going through early beta testing. If you don't want to have to mess with (Russian) files and rather play with your friends, just wait for that game to come out, because this is a different experience and requires a bit of effort on your end to make it work.\n\nNow more about this game: This game is awesome... and it was heart-breaking when I had crash after crash on my Windows 8.1 setup. It's a very simple game I hear being compared to the original Elite, but on land in a post apocalyptic world setting. It has a bit of a mixed steam-punk and post-apocalyptic feeling I get from this game, but it does so in a sort of charming way without the typical zombies and gore.\n\nNow here is the thing, I had to start over soooo many times because my saves would not load after a while and then I had to try play it mostly with Steam off by launching it from the game directory... it all failed sooner or later.\n\nWhy do I still recommend it now? Well, if you go to the Discussions of the Steam Community for this game, there is a Russian launcher/patch you can download specifically for this game to run on Windows 7/8 (from a Sticky thread). IT WORKS! After ignoring this game for almost a year, I was able to finally load my most recent save and it loaded and played beautifully! Yes, the graphics are a bit old, yes, there are still some glitches, the physics are non-existent, and the game is just simple to play with no base/station building or recruiting anybody... but is that a bad thing? The world maps are large, they are all tied together interestingly (and need to be fully explored to find interesting stuff/missions), trading generally works, and the wonderful trucks just plain look incredible. Unlike a lot of today's games, this one has a certain charm to it that I have not been able to find in any other game since I attempted to play this one originally. Well, to me it's still a lot of fun, and it offers a challenge, especially in the beginning before you learn that you are not that tough compared to what's roaming around out there. From my understanding, there are plenty of these sorts of "learning moments" through-out the game.\n\nAs a plus, it's NOT an MMO for a change! It's an honest-to-goodness single-player game in which you don't have to deal with greifers, and online connection, or a bunch of other hoopla you typically have with modern games.\n\nIf you are looking for a fun and simple vehicle-based RPG combat/trading game, then this game is for you... IF you can literally download a 3rd-party patch and edit the config for your resolution. If not, then please just move on. Most of the negative reviews are about the lack of stability when the game itself is actually very fun when it works... it's a shame, if it was not for the horrible support for this game, I feel like this could have been a massive and very popular franchise.\n\nUPDATE: As an update after I left this review and added 17 more hours to the Steam-recorded time... I had literally 2 crashes over the course of this time with the new 3rd party patch/launcher. Once it crashed when I tried alt+tabbing out of the game (I have alt-tabbed MANY times over 17+ hours, it only crashed once), and another time when I used F12 to try to make a Steam screenshot. It has run flawlessly for the remainder of the time. No issues loading saved games, no game-breaking glitches, just fun in the sun in my giant trucks! :D\n\nUPDATE #2: Had maybe 2 more odd crashes, but have a solid 30 hours of game time (from what is clocked on Steam) and getting close to the end (just finished the Oracle quest thing and looking for the second disc). The game is getting a little repetitive at times, but new maps look cool, and I still like the exploration aspect and doing missions even though I have more money than I can possibly spend. Still think it's a wonderful Elite-type game that I wish more people gave a chance to. The newish community patch in the Steam Discussions for this game makes this game work great. It's obviously an older game, it's not perfect, but it's unique... and now it actually runs!","July 18, 2015","true","37.1"," 34 of 39 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","34","39","0","4"

Then after palying through the first area crash #1 so i deleted the videos in the local files. now the game works fine. The few crashes i have had since have been during loading screens so save before leaving areas. AND SAVE OFTEN. With many files so you can load back a few if needed.\nTowards the end of the game some of the battles just got stupid i could shoot for ages and do so little and take heaps of damage at the same time. I love this type of game but the lack of info on the web the bugs and the fact steam seems like they never tested it makes it a wary buy. 6/10 includiing issues 9/10 gameplay wise.\n\nEDIT: When i played through it the trading cards were not out now they are. Also about 2 weeks after i beat it i replayed made a different choice in a mission and the whole campaign was different. great game if you can get it to work. 10/10\n\nEDIT: Well i have to go back thru and play for the cards now.

Because it is endearingly simple. (Space) trading games usually come with a billion of planets, try to awe you with a world full of "possibilities". I, personally, find these cold worlds intimidating, their space stations and gas clouds and futuristic ores. And their six axis control terror. I'm not made for dogfights.\n\nHTA, on the other hand, is a sandy game of browns and yellows and the main music whilst driving is a cute little country tune. (Which gets old fast, but anyway.) And the map is more neat than huge. But that's okay!\n\nSo there's a story about people that look like really cool, anaemic 3D puppets, but mostly you drive from A to B, deliver stuff and "bandits" will attack you inbetween and you gun them away with WASD and a mouse-controlled baby turret on your truck. Which is fully customizable. It all works alright.\n\nI think that's the game. It doesn't need more.\n\nYeah, sometimes, the colour palette is a little too friendly, there's nothing obviously "gritty" here. In a way, that's pretty realistic. If you lived in a world like this, this is what it would feel like, you wouldn't have a high contrast filter on your eyes or vignetted sight.\n\nPlaying Hard Truck Apocalypse is like driving through the German federal states of Brandenburg or Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, where the apocalypse is alreading taking place these days - abandoned villages, peaceful lakes, people doing odd jobs for nothing.","January 31, 2015","true","2.3"," 18 of 20 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","18","20","0","0"

Pushing them down the road with a keyboard ain't much fun—and driving eats up almost all of your playing time.The more interesting large-scale fire fights and planning truck upgrades provide some reasons to stick with it, along with nostalgia for dear old Interstate 76. If only Targem had concentrated on lending the missions more of the depth I76's sported, the other faults would be far more forgivable.The vast world with bandits and weapon-packed vehicles is an interesting idea, but being forced to meander back and forth across it just to earn a few scraps of cash makes the whole thing boring.Its gameplay isn't imaginative or original, but if you're looking for a quick fix of destructiveness, Apocalypse gets the job done.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kailen/recommended/285500/","Kailen","Kailen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kailen/","1108 products in account","It sounds like such a simple question.  "Do you recommend this game?"  But every now and then a game comes along that makes you really have to think about that.  This is one of those games.\n\nIt is a budget title.  A game that is massively flawed, but functional.  There are bugs, ranging from invisible walls in the middle of the map, floating grass, options such as reversing your mouse’s y-axis not saving when you exit the game, to the game not exiting properly, crashing, and not working on Windows 7 or higher without some tweaking.  There are bugs.  You will encounter them.\n\nThe game, originally Russian, has some problems in the translation.  Voice acting for the main character is flat.  He calls out things like “The roof is on fire!” when he spots enemies.  There are several more non-sequiturs in the game.  The story is fairly generic, limited.  However, it does branch out, letting you choose different factions to support during the game.\n\nThe game is not polished.  Your vehicle can climb mountains with ease, physics are described as ‘bouncy’.  To explain why all the characters’ faces don’t move, the creators decreed that all the characters wear masks (and, yes, the graphics reflect that).\n\nBut the gameplay is there.  You can drive around.  You can enter combat, with a variety of weapons.  Vehicles are done in a fairly strict upgrade process.  One chassis is better than another, one cab is better in nearly all stats and slots than another, same with beds.  Even with combat, some weapons are clearly better than nearly anything else in their slot (shotguns, particularly the medium shotgun, are fairly over powered compared to other available weapons).\n\nYou can raid, you can trade, haul cargo, complete quests.  You can finish the game.  It is not without flaws, but it is not without charm.  There are problems with AI spawn rates, where enemies will attack in rapid succession outside of a town, leading you into a loop of defending yourself, looting the scraps, returning to sell and repair, and then being attacks again right away.  Other times, you will not see an enemy for several maps if you run through them.  Yet the game also contains some clever fights (and some generic ones).\n\nThe first map perfectly introduces you to how to play.  The next string of maps seems to follow the trope of “they get worse as you go on, because fewer and fewer people will see them”, but began to improve again in time.  You do eventually see different environments from what most of the early game looks like.\n\nThis is a game that doesn’t feel done, but does feel like the devs had a clear idea of what they were trying to achieve.  And, gameplay wise, it is solid.  And it is fun, if that’s what you want.   So, in the end, do I recommend this game?  Yes, I think I do, if that is the kind of game you’re looking for, and if you can look past its many flaws.  But this game won’t appeal to everyone.","May 28, 2014","true","16.3"," 16 of 20 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","16","20","0","0"

Comical even. Like the main character's dead-pan reading of his father's death.\n-Fun combat\n-Has trading cards\n\nCons:\n-The starting just is just TOO SLOW. Or, the towns are all too far apart... maybe a little of both. I just felt like I was playing Euro Truck simulator for a lot of it. Driving a giant, slow truck through acres of nothing.\n-Rewards are tiny, which makes it hard to upgrade to more fun weapons and vehicles. I spent a lot of my earnings on repairs, and that was on easy mode.\n-Story is... not riveting, at least not as far as I got. Even though I listed voice acting as a funny pro, the downside is that its hard to get pulled in with bad dialog and voice acting.\n-Trading system seemed clunky and obtuse.\n-No achievements. This game could have really benefited from achievements.\n-Graphics are clearly aged, can't blame the game, its old, but I had to list it.\n\nOverall, if you take its age into consideration, I'd give the game a 7/10.\n\nBack in 2005, on the Playstation 2, I would've been playing this game.\nHowever, in the here-and-now (2015), with almost 1300 games in my library, this game is on the back, BACK burner. If you have a slow, old PC or have nothing else to play, then I'd say go for it. Or maybe for the laughs, or nostalgia.\n\n*Disclaimer: I recieved a free copy of this game from the developer in order to review it.","October 15, 2015","true","4.1"," 18 of 26 people (69%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","69","18","26","4","0"

I was honestly surprised. It has some problems but it's also got a lot that makes it very interesting as a game. An easy way to describe the game is a mix of the X series, Fallout series and trucks. It's a post-apocalyptic Privateer game where you control any sort of truck complete with weapons of all sorts.\n\nPros:\n-Well designed gameplay. Good controls that do give you some of the heft of driving a truck.\n-Plenty of weapons, that are even more realistic with varying penetration and degradibility.\n-Large open world to explore.\n-RPG elements, mostly in the form of quests.\n-Trading system that where you can use coins gathered from quests, bartering or loot to get new weapons and supplies.\n-Accurate damage modeling. I love when games do this because it makes it feel like you actually took damage. Your cab and your hold both take independent damage, and things such as damage tires and even bullet holes in where you were shot show up. However, damaged tires don't seem to affect the performance of the truck which I thought was weird.\n\nCons:\n-Bad voice acting, if not downright wooden. You can tell that it's been translated literally from another language.\n-Poor AI, at least on easier difficulties. I know that AI isn't supposed to be so grueling on easier settings, but I can honestly run into one with a consistent spray of machine gun fire and destroy it in a few seconds.\n-Graphics are a little bland. Although most post-apocalyptic games are like this due to the lack of lush life so I don't have a major problem with it.\n\nOverall, it's a fun game and I've barely gone down the rabbit hole in two hours. I see a lot of content in this one, and with all the decently-priced cards to sell you'd be hard pressed not to get it while it's on sale.\n\n8/10","May 29, 2014","true","5.6"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","1"

Shrouded in mistery your life is filled with numerous puzzle pieces that lead to a much bigger picture. Who are you? Who are these people? Where am I? What is this all about? Seek and you shall find, even learn more than the storyline is telling. Old worn out roads, telephone lines, monuments, secret places, biomes, the world of HTA just doesn't seem to have an end, and the story will put you in the right post-apocayptic mood for many hours.\n\nPros:\n\n-Many hours of gameplay.\n-Well designed open world (for an old game that is)\n-Role play fun.\n-Many quests, items, characters to reveal.\n-Unique gameplay experience, very rare for this kind of game.\n-A chilling storyline.\n\nCons:\n\n-No autosave, if you don't save manually every now and then you will be left stranded. The manual saving works very well though.\n-Few annoying bugs, they can be bypassed though.\n-Lack of storyline detail in some quests, ie, could use more cutscenes and speech.\n-Can get exhausting in travel at times.\n-No multiplayer. If only this game had full-blown MP support!\n\nConclusion:\n\nHTA is my second indie open world favorite for a very good reason. I've just replayed it for 7th-8th time after many years of not playing this game, and I can assure you the experience is memorable to say the least. My first indie open world favorite is A.I.M 1 and 2, which were developed and published by the same authors, and inhibit similar open world and post-apocalypse setting and storyline like HTA, albeit with a lot more detail and story telling. I strongly recommend both games and their sequels HTA: Clan Wars and A.I.M 2.

So, I feel like I need to write this review.\n\nFirst of all, I want to mention this: Played the game on windows 10. Didn't have any problem running it. I just needed to change resolution from config file because the game doesn't have options for new screens. Just read this guide for how to do that: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=238414792\n\nThe only problem I had was the game crashing in loading screen after alt-tab. Other than that, game runned smoothly.\n\nYou probably want to know how is story or is this game fun(obviously). Surprisingly, the story and lore is pretty good but story presentation is poor. There is two storyline, choosing sides may lead different events and there is multiple ending.\n\nGameplay is fun. If you played mechwarrior before you can see the resemble because you can customize your truck like a mech. You can buy new truck, body, guns and you can set weapon groups, etc.\n\nSoundtrack is very good. Every map has different on the road and battle music. I liked every one of them.\n\nSome conversation I had with people was very funny. Sometimes the game can turn to a post-apocalyptic parody.\n\nVoice acting is horrible. It's like voice actors telling a bedtime story to a little kid even if they trying to say they want to kill you.\n\nA.I. is like it's not exist. Especially for npc's.\n\nIf you are an explorer like me I got a bad news for you. Beware invisible walls!\n\nThere is some bugs and glitches like in every video games. They are not game killer one.\n\nIn short, it's a great game for an old game. If they released a second game, I would buy it.","May 23","true","35.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

All the fixes listed here that I have tried over a week-long period, have failed to get the game to run  very far past the second area. This has to be, by far, the worst experience I've had on Steam because the game is so promising and yet it won't run - a fact that has kept me trying just about anything short of learning Russian, to get it to work.\n\nThis is the third game that I've purchased on Steam that has repeatedly crashed. I know that Steam's legal department require them to take absolutely no responsibility for the games they sell, but I still like to imagine that someone in their management dpeartment still cares about their company enough to actually do something about selling a shoddy product. I once tried a game that crashed and later it was updated and fixed, but I notice from the posts on Hard Truck Apocalypse that these issues have persisted for quite some time.\n\nWith such issues I have to ask - Steam, why did you put this on sale for any other reason than taking money on a shoddy product that doesn't run for most of your user base?\n\nAs for those of you who feel a need to say it runs fine on your machine - so what really? Does that help anyone else with these problems?

I have spent so much time playing this game, and still i am surprised by the variety of the story line. This game is one of the best games I ever played along with Need For Speed Underground 2 and Euro Track Simulator 2. For me this game is better than Skyrim (I like guns more than swords). For me most of RPG games looks the same - swords, bows and magic, whereas this game is different. i rather fight with multiple guns (which can be used at once) and upgreating my truck with speed and horse power than with couple of possible guns walking around the world (Fallout3). It however requires some patience when making it work on windows seven, but it takes no more than 10 minutes to fix it with the guides on steam community site. I have to warn you that once you play that game you may never look at other rpg in the same way. Hard Truck Apocalypse among games is like 'Breaking Bad' among the tv series - you will never forget it.","July 7, 2014","true","35.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It's a hesitant recommendation as it definitely shows its age, and the framework they have didn't seem like there's much room left for improvement later in the game.  You're a truck, you shoot bandits.  ...That's it.  Grind long enough and you can get better armor, faster speed, and more guns to probably shoot more bandits in various vehicles.\n\nI'm mainly convinced the game doesn't change at all because of the core mechanics of combat, in that it's not really dynamic.  You drive in circles to make the AI lazily track you while whittling away at their health bar and they whittle away at yours.  Between that, you play Euro Truck Simulator and drive from point A to point B in a lifeless environment.\n\nIt's a thumbs-up mainly due to the charm that is there - it just sort of plops you in and says go have fun.  The voice acting is so bad it's okay, and it doesn't do much of any hand holding in terms of "here's what to buy / upgrade".  I could see the appeal in it, but ultimately not for me.  It's cute, but I wouldn't pay 8 bucks for it.","May 6, 2015","true","1.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kschang77/recommended/285500/","kschang77","kschang77","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kschang77/","993 products in account","Hard Truck Apocalypse (HTA) is a game that harkens back to Elite / Wing Commander: Privateer type game. You're a lone trucker, prowling the highways, moving freight, and killing enemies. You can be as good as as bad as you wish, but if you enrage a faction none of their towns will let you enter and their units will shoot you on sight, leading to further bloodshed. As you upgrade your truck wtih better weapons and better models, you will become an unstoppable force of the highways... As you search the world for the killer of your father, are you prepared for the truth? And perhaps, find what caused the apocalypse? And if given a chance, what will you do about it?\n\nAs the game was released almost a decade ago, the graphics are a bit dated, and out of the box (or fresh install) it has several bugs but all of that can be easily worked around with a few easy edits of config.cfg file. The game is not very stable. There are two notable bugs: 1) sometimes when game's loaded the key commands won't work. You may need to load a game multiple times to make the keys work, and sometimes going into town (not gas station) may resolve it. 2) the game often crashes when transiting between regions (about once very 4-6 transits). You should save or quicksave just before you exit the region.\n\nDespite the simple graphics, the game is much deeper than one would suspect. There are trade goods from each town and prices drop as you brought more in, and prices rise as you buy more. Enemies often drop loot which you can sell for profit. Trucks can be customized with various models of "cabs" and "beds", of various qualities. Some cabs and beds have additional weapons hardpoints and enhancement hardpoints so you can customize your truck. With dozens of weapons, from little 5.45mm MGs all the way to 20mm quad cannons to plasma cannons, lasers, mortars, and so on, you can customize the vehicle into your personal killing machine.\n\nBad parts about the game? No "autopilot" or even "cruise control". You have to hold down "w" to move forward, and you can't lock the view to "front" for driving, as the game relies on mouse-look for aiming your weapons, which is independent from your driving. This makes some driving quite tedious, esp. at the beginning when you have a relatively slow vehicle. Also, the game is in essence, a FPS where you "circle-strafe" the opponent. Depending on the vehicle, there will be a point where most guns can point toward, and that is where you want the enemy to be. Also, the game's translated from Russian, so there are PLENTY of translation errors here and there, typos, even a few "missing references". The plot is also quite... cliche.\n\nStill, if you like Mad Max style games this will be right up your alley. Even if it's not, if you like the "lone wolf roam the world" genre you should give this game a try, esp. if you get it cheap.","July 6, 2014","true","58.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It feels like it was made by robots. Dialog is stilted and very awkward, there are typos everywhere, missions are simple, the story is absolutely insane.

Coupled with mediocre graphics (which is usually something I don't mind) and a laughably bad story, the game just doesn't amount to much more than a filler for the Steam store."\n\n---Now---\n\nAfter diving deep into the heart of this game, I have seen that what was once a try-hard story and dull mechanics, are actually fairly moving and exciting. Granted the game takes it's sweet time to get the ball rolling, but once it does, you are presented with a huge amount of options as well as a huge amount of places to go.\nWant to be a mercenary with the most kick-♥♥♥ weapons imaginable? Have at it. Want to be a fairly low-key trader? Be my guest. Want to become a hero to all? Go ahead. Want to be the most hated ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ in all the land? It's all yours.\nThe selection of vehicles really got my attention too. You have a vehicle for any job. You have light trucks (that ♥♥♥♥♥♥ thing at the beginning), medium trucks, heavy trucks, battle platforms, transports, and even little buggers that speed around everywhere.\nThe guns tend to be a little lackluster until you get to mount 2 of them on one vehicle, where you can rain death on anything and anyone that opposes you.\nThe enviorment was really amazing. Even though the game is fairly "pre-uber graphics," it runs really well and looks really nice, plus there's some 400km^2 of land to look through for secrets. Yes, 400 squad kilometers, or about the whole of Sicily.\nThe story behind the whole game is also very (very) believeable: humans were careless and polluted everything so much that everything else died and now we have to wear ♥♥♥♥ing masks all the time just so we don't die of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ air, and now the only way to make a living is through trade of necessities of stealing of those necessities.\n\nThis game is really worth your time, but remember to SAVE YOUR GAME OFTEN. I lost about 2 hours of working that way.","April 20, 2014","true","14.4"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","1"

As if played this game when i was a kid. I loved it back then but it had massive problems which brings me too two negative points or lets say . This game got two main problem which one of them can be fixed and the other too.. i suppose.\n\nThe first problem is the engine and this game engine is..... a stone is more stable and runs better . Not saying the game cant reach 60Fps and run smooth. No the game crashes sometimes and has no autosave option. The overall options like Resolution / Graphics / Sound . They sometimes wont save and you have to edit them manual.\n\nAnd now for the second problem.\n\nThere is a Windows 7 patch which sound awesome right? Well not quite its russian only. I managed to install the patch without problems but i spend houers in google translating the text in the insturctions . Quite the time... did the job... i hope.Ohhh and there is suprisingly a ♥♥♥♥ ton of mods for the game.\n\nIm not the type of dude for verdicts but yeh.\n\n"Its a good way to waste time "\n\nThats all waht im gonna say about HTA / Ex Machina\n\nThanks for reading.","August 20, 2015","true","8.2"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Just going to quickly say if you are about the graphics I suggest looking over this one. If however you do like gameplay and a RPG type thing with a truck, then heck this game is for you.\n\nThe game definitely starts out a bit slow, and the traveling can seem endless. Over time though it gets better the more money you get and can customize your vehicle. There are factions within the game you can fight or make friends with, which of course comes with trade. Weapons are interesting as some provide a different scheme than others. Some weapons can fire no matter what direction you are pointing while some have limited range.\n\nOne thing I found sort of interesting is if you press C (I think it was), a camera drops from the vehicle your driving and stays like a land mine. This camera angle helps to shoot an opponent while remaining stable. Although you cant always see your truck, this sort of gives a bit of freedoms driving around (given you can see your truck which way your shooting).\n\nIt's a interesting game and would recommend buying it on sale if your looking for something different. I also wasn't a big fan of the voice acting.\n\nIf you're looking for a ground breaking game I suggest you keep going.\n\n6.9/10","August 16, 2014","false","0.9"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","7","13","0","0"

But, between the lack of ANY post-apoctalyptic feeling to the game, poor mechanics, and stupid enemies, I cannot reccomend this game.  Even as a driving sim, it sucks.  First off, the game uses kilometers.  And you are stuck at about 90 kph the whole first "level".  The characters are laughably poor.  I felt zero empathy during the burned village scene.  There is no reason to follow the story.  None.  The whole game feels "clunky"  i guess is the most positive way to describe it.  And don't get me started on how weak your enemies are.  Or how OP your starting truck is.  The most annoying thing for me, personally though, is how obvious it is that the game creator's english ruins all parts of the game.

And I did. It played fine for a while and it was a LOT of fun in the short time I played it. However, after I loaded my first save, some keys became unresponsive. Most importantly for me, was the Esc Key; if I can't get into the menu of a game I just bought, there is something VERY wrong. And I don't care if there was 88% off this game when I bought it... a bucket with a hole in it that cost 10c is still a bucket with a hole. And it's the principle of the thing.\n\nThere are threads on the forums here with all kinds of "Magical" solutions... none worked for me. Here is a solution I would like to see... I buy a game on Steam... and it works! Is that too hard to ask these days? This is an old game, true, but should that be an excuse for basic core elements not functioning... like keys?\n\nI'm really torn about this, because again, I enjoyed what I played of it, and it has quite a bit of depth to it. I can't play on though with unresponsive keys. This game, and many, many more like it should be checked before they are uploaded by developers to Steam.\n\nI ask the developers, if you read this, can you please fix these issues. This game will see much better sales, if people like me, are not forced to come in here and write a negative review about a game they actually liked.","January 19","false","1.2"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Just to be clear I am going to slam this game long and hard below because I believe in being brutally honest, but there is actually some enjoyment to be had here. It may have its problems and be quite generic even for a game made in 2005, but the combat is not poorly done and overall the game is not poorly done. If you do not get bored easily and can appreciate that this game was released during the prehistoric age of gaming (2007 or before) and don't go into it with high expectations, you will find that it runs perfectly smooth with no technical issues (for me anyway) and is done competently enough that, as I said, a fair level of enjoyment can be gleaned from your time spent.\n\nThe bad:\nTerribly generic and old. Anything 2007 and older (this is 05) is the prehistoric age of gaming and the farther we get away from those times of depressingly basic PC game programming equivalent to cavemen drawing on walls, the better. I became a PC gamer back in 1997 but I can admit that until more recent years gaming was just never very satisfying because technology has only finally become what gamers have been waiting for. Driving within five feet of a rock causes a collision even if you can visibly see you aren’t touching it. Collision detection/being stuck is a real problem: there is a unstuck key (O) but it only works selectively. It worked once earlier in the game for me, but recently it would not. I was fighting a truck and I wasn't watching where I was driving because it is tough to do while also having to aim at a enemy, and I rammed into a tree, broke it and it fell over, and it left behind an invisible stump underneath my truck that I was teetering on and could not get off of so I had to reload my game which thankfully I had just quicksaved a minute earlier. That's another thing about this game: no autosave whatsoever. F2 is quicksave and F3 is quickload, so be ready to press F2 constantly. Textures are poorly done: the graphics generally look like absolute garbage and I have seen on several occasions patches of grass floating a few feet above the ground. All textures also pop in and out: if it is going offscreen it will disappear until you move the camera in that direction and it will pop back in. This one is hilarious: your minimap has a N at the top meaning of course “North” but it also has a S at the bottom meaning of course “South”. The first couple hours playing this game I assumed it was a dollar sign because I do not recall ever seeing any game with more than just a N on the minimap, which if you have a N on the radar to show you which way is north, why the fk would you need an S at the bottom? Just astonishing. Probably the most intolerable part of the game is that it has the worst music in the history of gaming. But without the music on you are driving through miles of barren, lifeless, boring wasteland with nothing to do, no other cars to kill usually, so without the music all you are going to hear while driving is the hum of the engine, which is a poor sound effect at that. I suppose I could turn off the game's ear-bleedingly bad music and play my own music on windows media player but that still won't change the fact that you are going to be driving miles upon miles through nothing while doing nothing. You will have a TON of that in this game: driving through a wasteland with nothing to do but try not to fall asleep at the wheel. Sometimes you get to kill other cars, sometimes... You can't touch anything while driving or you will rack your repair bill up the @ss and repairs are not cheap: I broke through a wooden fence and it dropped my durability from 850 to 810 lol are you kidding me. It gets worse too: I was driving past a piece of fence and was clearly about 5ft away from it and it sort of snagged my truck and made it whip around and slam into a second row of fence beyond it, reducing my durability on my truck big time. Some of the worst programmed AI I've ever seen: enemies get stuck on objects sometimes and you just blast the ♥♥♥♥ out of them. Sometimes friendly AI vehicles will repeatedly try to slam through an unsmashable gate to get into the quest area where you are waiting to advance the game, whereas if they would just back up and go to the left or right a little they can get in. But no! ♥♥♥♥ that! Lets keep backing up and try to repeatedly ram through this solidly programmed gate! I suppose that can be added to the "good" section I have above since it really is pretty funny.\n\nOverall, 6/10","May 31, 2014","true","4.5"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","2","8","0","0"

It was a nice game in its own time, but I'm going to have to give it thumbs-down because its place is in a museum, not a store.\n\nPros:\n- big variety of cars and weapons\n- car customization\n- fairly interesting story\n\nCons:\n- utterly boring gameplay - 90% of the time you're just driving around from town to town in vast and mostly void locations occasionally fighting some bandits. Many quests take place in different locations, so you have to drive all across the world to speak with some character and then drive back to proceed with the quest. The game should be called "Hard Truck, or There and Back Again".\n- bad car handling and physics - sometimes a massive, building-size car is jumping around on hills like a balloon\n- after the cutscenes and upon exiting the towns you have no control over the car for a second or so (the AI is controlling it and you just watch it driving). During that second there's a chance that AI will drive your car into a tree and you will stuck in it, or it will drive you to an ally car, damaging it and turning this ally (and whole its faction) into enemy. In either case you'll have to load last save and try again, so save often.\n\nThere were almost no technical issues though. I just checked "Run as administrator" in Steam shortcut and everything was OK.

That should be a first hint right there), manually editing the config files from the default just to get a reasonable screen resolution, crafting a special shortcut to prevent it from running on more than one CPU core (how many PCs these days have a single-core CPU anymore?), and disallowing Steam updates to avoid a standard mechanism from undoing all the required fixes.\n\nNot even after following unreadable non-translated Russian quintuple-redirected patch download links on pure faith. I almost stopped clicking through after the fifth redirect level, way more than my sense of computing security wanted to allow me to, and now it is justifiably nagging at me from the back of my mind for running the risk with zero reward, since even the acclaimed community-created patch did not make things work (no offence to my Russian co-gamers, but clicking through links one cannot read that keep redirecting away to yet more sites one cannot read, is just not safe Internet practice, and I am sure many non-Russians are stopped from downloading the patch because of that. Even a purely Google-translated blurb with a direct download link would go far at making it at least 'feel' safer, warranted or not).\n\nThe devs themselves, despite obviously being very much not dead as shown by their posts, and despite feeling quite ok about still asking money for their broken product, are unwilling to either fix their own product or to validate the community-created patch by making it an official part of the Steam download.\n\nThis game should plainly NOT be advertised as working on Win7/8, and should definitely not be sold as such. That creative and persistent community members managed to (sometimes? mostly?) make it work through more effort than is warranted for a paying customer, does not mean you are allowed to advertise something for what it is not.\n\nWhich in the end is a damn shame, because the videos make it look like good fun. I went into this eyes open since I always read forums before-hand, and it looked fun enough to warrant some effort to get a clearly abandoned game to work. That 'some effort' unfortunately turned out to be more time than I have spent on fully playing through other very enjoyable games, to get zero results. I had one last workaround in mind (creating a dedicated WinXP VM to run the game in) but frankly I have not found any further energy to try anymore. Money totally wasted, since the devs show no signs or initiative of fixing this, not even by admitting defeat and accepting community help.\n\nAvoid at all costs unless you have an old pre-win7 system lying around; and considering the types and severity of the crashing bugs, maybe not even then, but I cannot vouch for it either way. Others obviously are having more success, but it's far from guaranteed to work for you and more effort than many will want to spend.\n","July 15, 2014","false","4.9"," 2 of 9 people (22%) found this review helpful","22","2","9","0","0"
