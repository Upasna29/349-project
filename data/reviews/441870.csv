The description of the game is longer the actual game.\n\nAll you do is seriously drive around one track for as long as you can without any obstacles other than the occasional roadblock with a ramp and a gunship that spawns every 8 minutes getting in the way. That's it. That's the whole game. The bullets don't even do anything! They're not even a threat! All they do is make the road randomly spawn debris in your face which comes with no warning. There's no other hazards... just hard turns, roadblocks and a gunship. Pitiful.\n\nThe only good thing this game has going for it is a nice aesthetic and some pretty good music. $3 for literally 8 minutes of gameplay... 13 if you actually can make one full lap without falling asleep. Literally get the ♥♥♥♥ out.\n\nPerhaps I'm being harsh on, say, a college student's final project for school but this isn't something you charge people for. Nitronic Rush was a final project for school and that had more content and was released free. This is a 99 cent mobile game AT BEST. Also, don't copy Powerdrive 2000. You're not Powerdrive 2000. And you're not going to ride off it's kickstarter success.\n\nIf you want a game with more in-depth gameplay and content check out Distance (the same team who made Nitronic Rush).\n\nUPDATE 2/26: DENVER has recently updated the game's description to say this game was created just for the sake of music in order to save face. Yes, the music is decent, but don't be fooled, the game is stil garbage. Do not fall for it.","February 22","false","0.4"," 142 of 173 people (82%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","82","142","173","6","0"

It's  "what you see is what you get." The game is an 80's inspired endless driver, like what you'd might get on the App store honestly. There is not much to the game at all. The driving feels clunky, but really easy to get accustomed to. Unfortunately the game is locked to 30 FPS and makes the quality of the game look even less.\n\nThe game is priced at $1.79 at the time of writing this (2/22/16), and I can say for this price it's okay, but personally I would not recommend it. You will get a hour or so of playtime out of it and become bored quickly because there isn't much more than what is offered. I can see this game working a lot better on the phone rather than a PC game release. Just 80's and driving.. But hey, if you like the music you're better off just going buying it off the different artists' bandcamps.","February 22","false","3.1"," 93 of 119 people (78%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","78","93","119","2","4"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/borleskort/recommended/441870/","borleskort","Din","http://steamcommunity.com/id/borleskort/","633 products in account","OutDrive, in one way, is an amazing achievement, and DENVER has a lot to be proud of with their creation. I mean that. The screenshots simply do not do this game any level of justice, as there's actually a lot of varied scenary to keep things fresh and thus never feels like the "empty sunset highway" some people have voiced concern over before buying. The combination of audio/visual elements delivers THE best 80's/neon/VHS/vaporwave experience I've ever seen in a video game, hands down.There is so much attention put into everything, from the tastefully low polygon count on most of the assets, to the bloom that glows softly off of the neon and the post-processing filter across the screen, it all ensures that this game feels like a 3D interactive vaporwave poster art. As a work of art, it's meticulously crafted and feels SO good to play for the first few minutes.\n\nAlas, the art style is not the aforementioned achievement displayed in this product, because it's just ripping off of the upcoming Kickstarter-funded game Power Drive 2000. Seriously, look up some screenshots and try not to feel insulted on behalf of PD2k's developers. Even if you're someone who's really into the whole vaporwave/vhs aesthetic, this game is not worth the price of admission as it's just a petty clone/cashgrab feeding itself off of the Power Drive hype. I want to make it clear that I do not hate this game for not being Power Drive, because I had no idea what Power Drive was until after I  played this game and read some of the user reviews. I have zero attachment to that project, and my opinion is not in comparison to that game, but how the game stands on its own merit in a world where it was actually an original idea.\n\nThe problem with OutDrive is that, beyond stimulating your eyes and ears, there is NOTHING left. At its most basic level, the game mechanics are actually quite good, which makes it even more confusing that nothing interesting was done with them. Driting around sharper turns is fun, hitting the ramp between roadblocks is fun, balancing speed with trying not to overheat keeps you engaged as you drive. And yet, absolutely none of these things provide you with any real challenge. My FIRST run in the game lasted 28 minutes and the only reason I stopped was because I was BORED, not because I failed. Despite having a meter that forces you to go fast but not too fast, I spun out, came to a COMPLETE halt, hit the (unlimited) boost, and was back on my way without penalty. It's borderline insulting.\n\nThere are so many great ideas here that just don't do anything meaningful. If you're driving through a city (which looks ♥♥♥♥ing SICK, by the way) you may have to dodge cross-traffic or some of the lanes may have a car driving alongside you. It would have been so easy to use this as an opportunity to challenge the players environmental awareness as they have to watch the road ahead of them, and dodge the cars beside them, and yet these other cars are separated by wide distance, predictable, and easily avoided. Likewise, there is a helicopter that shows up once in a while to fire bullets at you, which literally just bounce off your car when you do get hit, there is no consequence for this whatsoever. Sometimes, the chopper will try missiles instead, which hit the road ahead of you, bringing up chunks of pavement that you may crash into if you're not careful. While these missiles are the hardest part of the game, they are by no means a threat, considering even if you get hit by a big slab of the road and find yourself turned 180 degrees, all you have to do is quickly press that boost, turn around, and you're on your way before your speed meter ever reaches the bottom.\n\nIf you want to jam out to some downtempo 80's-esque electronic synth music while dining on a visual feast, go for it, but do not expect the game to challenge you in any way. It's an endless runner that somehow screwed up the most necessary part of the genre: losing. And that's one hell of an achievement to be proud of.","February 24","false","0.5"," 81 of 102 people (79%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","79","81","102","2","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/KillingArts/recommended/441870/","KillingArts","KillingArts","http://steamcommunity.com/id/KillingArts/","5056 products in account","As the game is now, I cannot recommend it. The gamepad support is broken. You need the boost ability, but it doesn't work with a gamepad. That means after the very cool and promising intro you start the game, and die after 10 seconds. No matter what you do, you always die after exactly 10 seconds. Then you switch to keyboard and realize what was going on. The boost simply doesn't work with the controller. But you need the boost to survive. Ok, so I played a few minutes with the keyboard, but it just didn't feel right. The sensitivity is way off, you're just not able to control the car very well. It feels horribly. The drift is also pretty bad. The game has an interesting idea (keep up the speed or your girl dies), a simple but nice art style, and dynamic, speed-dependent music - but the controls eliminate every bit of enjoyment you might have gotten out of it. If they work on this, it might turn out to be a decent game in the future, though. I will give it another try at some point.","March 11","false","3.8"," 44 of 50 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","44","50","0","0"

His girlfriend is shot and you hook her up to your Delorean and you have to maintain a certain speed to keep her alive.Drive too slow she dies, drive too fast she dies.\n\nThe neon visuals and overall the entire design is fantastic, but sadly that's where the good ends and the bad begins.\n\nThe game is endless and there's no ending what so ever, and to experience everything the map has takes you at least 15 minutes and after that there's nothing else. There are obstacles in the road like road blocks and ramps. There are also random encounters like traffic and a helicopter which shoots at you, but it does absolutely nothing and after a few shots the helicopter explodes.\n\nThe entire game gets tiring after a few minutes and after that there's nothing to do.\n\nThe soundtrack is great and is really fun to drive around to listen to the music, but it's not worth to play the game just to listen to the music.\n\nI wanted to like this game, I really did, but I can't, my honest recommendation is to wait until Powerdrive 2000 comes out this coming May,\n\nFinal Rating:\n3/10 - Don't Bother\n\nIf you liked this review please consider giving this game a thumbs up and if you disliked post in the comments on what you disliked.\n\nFor more reviews follow Snort's Review curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!\n","March 21","false","3.4"," 46 of 64 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","46","64","0","0"

If you use the keyboard it works fine, since it does both, boost and save the girl.\n\nIf you are trying to put the Acceleration function to the controller trigger, you wont be able to do it on the first Accel option you see, scroll down, and you will see another Accel option, that one will let you do it. The dev, put separate ones for the controller. EXCEPT for BRAKE. There is no way to put Brake on the the other trigger. It will however accept a button on the secondary for the only Brake function on the Control configuration launcher area. BUT NO AXIS FOR BRAKING.\n\nX-Box 360 controller needs to be configured before you play. EVERY TIME YOU PLAY.\n\nThere are no options in-game whatsoever. You have graphics and control settings on the launcher.\n\nGraphics Options on the launcher do not save for me. Ever. You need to change it every time you play. SERIOUSLY, EVERY TIME!\n\nNo Audio Options. NONE.\n\nGame does not tell you how to play, as simple as it is, you should at least know what you should do or not do, I kept getting game over after a few seconds even though the car was already quite fast, it was only when I tried to use the keyboard left shift button that I noticed that the key function was bugged on the controller function.\n\nI don't mind unfinished games, I rarely finish most of my games anyway, what I do not like under any circumstance are non-functional games. That's what this is for me. I simply can not play it, regardless of how cheap it is, it should at least work.\n\nI was looking forward to playing this, and simply writing a review that says "This is what you would get if Kung Fury, TopGear and Distance had a Baby!". The soundtrack alone is fantastic. The concept is really cool too. Hopefully they will add more functionality to the game, some in-game menus (not very hard to do), and just make it playable. Looking forward to when I can delete everything that's written above and just keep that catchy sentence, until then, hold on to your money.","February 23","false","0.3"," 34 of 46 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","34","46","0","0"

This is a series that's all about driving all over the world in an expensive sports car. It's just you, the road, and the love of your life. Even when you're not behind the wheel of a Ferrari, your car has the top down, so both the driver and the passenger are visible. This is a minor detail, but it really adds to the sense of escapism. In Outrun 2, the girlfriend is very expressive, cheering on your successful driving skills, and getting annoyed when you bump into cars. While it's easy to say that the Outrun games are great, due to their fantastic controls and solid game-design, it's the tone and atmosphere that really bring it all together.\n\nOutdrive is...well I'm going to be serious here. Outdrive is a twisted metaphor for keeping a loved-one on life-support. In the intro, your girlfriend is shot during a hired hit, a drug deal gone bad, or actually... nevermind. The reason is irrelevant. Basically, she's going to die, and there's nothing you can do about it. Even knowing this, you hook her up to your car's engine to keep her alive. This isn't a temporary measure; you aren't going to get her to the hospital or anything. The purpose of this game is to drive for as long as possible, until you either go too slow, too fast, or realize the futility of it all and pull the plug.\n\nI hate to go on a moral tangent in a videogame review, but I'm just calling it like I see it. After hooking your girlfriend up to your car, the only signs of life she exhibits are open eyes and in-between songs you can hear some breathing. Granted, she was mortally wounded only minutes ago, but she's already in what could be considered a vegetative state. It would be different if she spoke, or showed some awareness. Maybe she would talk about what happened, use her last moments to reflect upon better times, etc. It's not like her condition will improve, so why do this? So the two of you can sit in silence and listen to synth-music while looking at the neon li-everything?\n\nOh right, the game portion, I nearly forgot to talk about this. In short, the controls are awful. As the other reviews have stated, keyboard-only is the way to go, because you have to constantly boost to keep the girl alive. For whatever reason, the gamepad doesn't function properly. Steering is problematic, and drifting sends you into just as many walls as not-drifting. Oddly enough, your speed doesn't actually matter. As long as you have your finger on the boost, and are making at least some forward (and sometimes even backward!) progress, then the girl will stay "alive". It's entirely possible to drive at 10-15 mph and it wouldn't affect anything. After about eight and a half minutes, a helicopter appears to shoot at you. This can cause debris to block your path, but it's mostly ineffective. Although, I will point out that the first time the girl died was because I got stuck in debris, the car flipped upside-down, and everything started spazzing out.\n\nBy the way, when your girlfriend dies, the game says that you killed her. What? Maybe it's the driver finally accepting the inevitable, and realizing he was wrong to put someone he cares about in such a dangerous situation in the first place. You can also hit the "r" key at any time. This is considered the kill button. Now I'm not even sure what the game's intentions are supposed to be. Pressing the "r" key causes the game to instantly restart, and you don't recieve a "You killed her" message for that. This is what I get for reading too far into things, because now the game is just throwing me for a loop. By the way, if you're driving too fast or slow, your girlfriend will suffer from intense pain. Yes, the game posts a message saying as much whenever you restart.\n\nOutdrive isn't just a bad driving game, it's also really depressing. What's the point of playing this game for a long period of time? To brag to others that you kept a dying person alive - possibly against their will - for an hour or two? This is nothing more than a hollow and extremely selfish accomplishment. Just let her go. It's difficult to accept, but it's better this way. I don't mean to delve into these serious subjects, but within minutes of playing, the realization hit me, and I started to feel absolutely horrible. Nobody deserves to be treated like this.\n\nSo.... yeah... Anyone up for a game of CrotchFighter?","March 18","false","6.2"," 30 of 49 people (61%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","61","30","49","5","0"

There are also times where the car flips up for no reason.   I was able to make it to 1 hour 57 minutes 41 seconds before being flipped sideway into one of the road blocks.

Maintaining control of the car is difficult given how keys have been mapped -- very cramped. You can re-map the controls, but this kind of game really needs controller support. In this day and age, for this type of game, not including PROPER controller support is just lazy.\n\nAnd for those of you that say that you CAN use a controller ... well, it is not working properly for me. For example, when using the boost, which you absolutely need for this game, I can see it's working, but the game doesn't seem to recognize it, so I die anyway.\n\nTo survive, you must keep your speed within a certain band -- you can't drive too slow or too fast for extended periods or game over. I can understand a mechanism that encourages the player not to go too slow, but too fast is a problem ...? Totally lame mechanism.\n\nFinal verdict: 1/10 - Not rad. The 1 point is for style and graphics, but lack of substance.I was hoping for an OutRun-like game ... simplistic but enjoyable driving, but OutDrive is not fun at all. Don't be swayed by the cool graphics, which are definitely amazing. But the game itself is boring and frustrating, with terrible controls. Classic case of a game that have some interesting ideas and looks gorgeous, but fails in execution and gameplay.

Anyway, the constant balancing act of maintaining a certain speed and not overheating your engine is too hard and quite annoying to tell you frankly.\nThere is not a lot going on in the highway by way of vehicular traffic other than the occassional ramps every now and then.\nTo sum up, you are buying a racing game basically.

It was a giveaway thing. As such the following will be written from that perspective.\n\nOutdrive is a game that is almost not a game. It has some loose narrative in that your girlfriend gets shot and you must 'out drive' the the 'bad dudes' in order to save her and presumably get her to a hospital, if such a thing even exists in the retro neon dystopia of the far flung future. The juxtaposition here is that there is no hospital. For what seems a procedurally generated track, the actual game is really just an endurance run with a timer.\n\nYou must use boost to keep the car at speed designated by the blue bar directly behind the car. Go to fast or go to slow. She dies.\n\nNow, the music in this game is actually quite decent. Its mindless and very relaxing. The tempo decreases and gets distorted when your car is not going at speed. Which is a bit disappointing for relaxing aspect of it but its no matter really.\n\nI had a hell of time trying to get a gamepad to actually do anything worth while. Trying two 3rd party programs as well as just setting the key bindings in the setup utility. I eventually settled on just WASD'ing my way through it. I'm no stickler for peoples preferred control method but certain genres beg a specific control scheme. Either way WASD works well enough for this task.\n\nThe car physics are extremely suspect as well. A gentle tap on the wall will send you spinning and usually end up facing the other way. It seems once the car leaves the ground it weighs less than a piece of paper. At one point I started driving sideways on the invisible boundary of the track and a helicopter knocked me off and I was able to drive out of bounds a short while until I was blasted into the sky and juggled for a bit until my girlfriend died.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=669195383\n\nAll in all, for free I can't complain. The music is good and WASD isn't totally the worst thing ever for an arcade driver.

But somehow when you get the control everything will be fine.\nMaybe too fine... Once you mastered the controls, the game become extremely easy. Road is empty, you'll have to face an helicopter shooting at you maybe every 5 minutes.\nAnd about the track, 50% of the time you just driving on an empty road, with no traffic and empty surroundings. It gets boring pretty quickly, and I'm pretty sure the map is not generated. During my 20 playtime, I came across the same city, with the same crossroads at least 10 times.\n\nAbout the gameplay, the game expect you to drive not too slow to keep your "girlfriend" alive but also NOT TOO FAST.... DO NOT GO TOO FAST ! in a driving game ?!?! Excuse me ? So you've got to juggle with your tubo, toggling it off and on every 10 seconds. Which make the camera pan, zoom in, zoom out, every time... It gets really nauseous.\n\nIs this game a sequel to outrun ?\nNot at all, the crossroad are there but feel empty. I don't feel like accomplishing something when I survive past a crossroad.

Everyhing I'm doing feels empty, and serve no purpose.\n\n\nSo in conclusion, in its current game, OutDrive could be the core of a good driving game.

I've thought a lot about whether I want to give a thumb up or down and I'm not happy with either option. I got it for 1,79€ which might be okay if you really like it. But I have to admit that I'm quite disappointed.\nAs it stands the game doesn't deliver a reason to be played.\n\nAs other reviews already said - it totally lacks in content und optimization. And I thought about what I feel it's missing:\nFirstly, it definitely needs more settings. An adjustable camera - it's really hard to see what's coming on the road. Even if it would be like in Trackmania with 3 different positions to choose from.\nAudio sliders for not only the music, but also the car noises and SFX would be awesome.\nThe game definitely needs graphic options. I just played for 20 minutes but now I've got a huge headache from those horizontal lines and all the different lights everywhere. Please give us an options menu with ways to enable and disable all the different visual effects used. This is literally the first game I've played that game me a headache just because of the visuals.\nAnd a menu with a tracklist where you can listen/preview the tracks and disable/enable them for the game. Maybe even add support for own music or spotify/soundcloud. maybe give us an adjustable RNG - like how many events (roadblocks etc.) occur and such.\nIt's just "Hey, you can drive as long as you want - or can. Look at the street (or the blue bar beneath the car) and enjoy the music (if it suits your taste)."\nReasons for playing could include achievements, multiple play modes, maybe even a small storymode. driving through different parts of the country with levels getting harder. and a happy ending where you are actually able to save the girl.\njust quick ideas for another play mode: relaxation mode, where the girl can't die and you just drive and boost the way you want.\nThe game could also get Steam Workshop support. Player-made mods would be awesome. More car models, different scenery textures, other modifiers.\nThis game has so much potential that just screams to be used!\nPlease make it happen!\n\nP.s.: Nothing happened to me after 8 minutes.

During the SNES years, it was Top Gear. Anyway, I remember my dad commenting a time or two about how it bothered him that in these racing games, you have this background that you're heading to, but never seem to actuly get to. The background never tessellates. I remember, at like 10 years old, explaining to my dad that the point of the game was the race, not to actuly "get anywhere," and the background was just an esthetic choice by the artists that had nothing to do with the game's core mechanics. My pops agreed with this, but said it would be cool if you could get to the mysterious city looming in the far background. This struck me as strangely magical thinking for a guy who rarely played video games, who usually spent his days with invoices, groceries, dishwasher repairs, and other boring adult stuff I still don't care about, and probably that is why the idea of "getting to the background" stuck in my head for many years. And I'm not the only one, apparently. Games like Grand Theft Auto 5 represent the full experience of the long drive that actuly gets you to the background. Magic. I thought about that a lot after activating Trevor in GTA5, and the game makes you take that LONG drive from the background into the part of the game you were just in on Franklin. Epic. Thought provoking. But one of those thoughts is, In this rush to make these hyper-advanced sandbox games that let us do all these things we dreamed of doing in less-interactive games for years, have we ignored the simpler, more pure and patient pleasures offered us by older games, have we neglected updating that simple experience in favor of games that really just have TOO much going on in them sometimes? Enter the new generation of "retro" games, with new graphics and sound, but with more pure game-play elements than the standard "do whatever you want and get a trophy for everything" style that the console industry churns out by the billions these days. Out Drive is one of those games. There is no where to "get to," once you're there you just win. But the GAME itself is driving, just DRIVING. Driving with a sense of urgency, not to get anywhere in the game, but to GET somewhere inside yourself. Plumb the depths of your skills. There is no real plot, you just HAVE. TO. DRIVE. You're already where you're getting to. Just. Drive.","May 9","true","0.8"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","2"

Xinput controls feel annoyingly incomplete out-of-the-box and the game only gives you about ten seconds to get acquainted with all of the various driving mechanics before you "die" and it forces you to restart. You also need to be boosting from the beginning.\n\nIt's pretty telling that the Game Over screen is just the title image.\n\nWorth noting is that there's another retro 80s-style racing game called Power Drive 2000, which is coming out soon, that this game seems to be trying to rip off and make a quick buck. And Power Drive 2000 has different game modes, cars, and tracks. I'll be buying that one, instead.\n\nTL;DR Save your money and buy Power Drive 2000","February 23","false","0.1"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

The controller support is very sketchy and the Keyboard and mouse feels more like gliding on a sled then driving a car not to add in I am not sure if there is any reverse feature in case you run into a wall or a pile of cars. The game does have some stuttering problems also even on a over recommendation computer.\n\nThe idea that this is a project made for the music is kind of a joke also because the music is constantly interupted by having to turn the boost on and off to keep the heart rate gauge in the correct range.

Thanks, guys!)\n\nOn first glance, it feels like Rad Racer from NES.  A game from my childhood.  I booted it up and saw that eerie little window that shows up before you open a game asking me for my graphic preferences.  I then am able to access the game.....no....no dear god, NO!!!!! "Made with Unity personal edition".\n\nWell, the story's simple even though the text goes off screen, and no matter the resolution, the relatively quick scrolling text vanishes on the left and right sides of the screen.  Basically, you end up in a gunfight while on a date with your girlfriend.  During the gunfight, your girlfriend gets fatally wounded.  In order to spend more time in her last moments of life, you hook her up to the car's engine to act as her life support.  After that, the game begins.  The goal of the game is about survival.  Go too slow, the girl dies.  Go too fast, the engine overheats, the girl dies.  The controls feel awkward and the game needs polishing.\n\nAlthough everything I've said so far is negative, there is good news.  The graphics look good and the music sounds sweet.....until you overheat or go too slow, to where it sounds like distorted garbage.\n\nThis game is on the right track to being something decent in unity, but it needs a lot of polishing before it can be something good.  $3 is not justified here.  Not yet, at least.\n\n\n3/10","April 20","false","1.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

These music and visuals are both pretty solid qualities of the game but unfortunately what supports these aspects are nowhere near as impressive.\n\nYou simply drive in OutDrive, it's a procedurally generated driving game in which you just have to keep moving within a certain speed range or else you fail. Sometimes there's some random events that happen but that literally just consists of either brief oncoming traffic or an attack helicopter that tries to shoot you. These are handled pretty well for the most part and I don't mind a game in which you just drive but there is a real lack of content here, even for a game that's £2.\n\nThere are no online leader boards or particular diversity to each playthrough. Despite technically driving through a unique path each time, it barely feels any different and having only a couple of short random events just leaves me slightly unsatisfied.\n\nHowever there are two major problems with the game that render the rest unimportant. The game performs horrendously, this will likely be one of the most demanding indie games you play. It's surprising how good of a rig you will need in order to run this game at 60FPS, it even struggles to maintain 30FPS on a PC that can run most big releases on mid-low settings. Another problem in terms of optimization is crashes, I've had this game crash 4 times on me completely out of nowhere and I've heard similar complaints from other Steam users.\n\nThe second major problem would be the controls, the car just doesn't handle well at all. It feels rigid and clunky, I fail to see how such a key aspect of a driving game was made so poorly. While it's possible to overcome the bad car handling to an extent, you'll never feel as though it plays the way it should.\n\nI really wanted to like this game and from a visual and audio standpoint I absolutely do. I even think many tracks from the OST will be ones I'll listen to outside of the game. But a lack of diversity, lack of real content, lack of optimization and lack of decent controls stop me from being able to recommend this game. Don't bother with the game at all, even if you see it for free just don't get it.\n\nScores:\n\nAudio & music : 8/10\nVisuals: 8/10\nGameplay: 3/10\nOptimisation & performance: 2/10\nValue (at full price): 5/10\n\nFinal verdict: 4/10 AVOID COMPLETELY!!!","April 21","false","0.5"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

It was broken so I had to hold the "Play" button to listen to the music I was into. On one hand it made me feel uncomfortable, on the other - I had great time listening to my favourite tracks.\nSame kind of feeling I have with OutDrive - the gameplay is bad, at point I can say this is hardly a game at all. Your DeLorean handling is awful, physics are non-existent and there's no controller support (for the game like this - almost a crime). The other big problem I had is the lack of any motivation to play. There's no rewards - no achievements, no ladder to compare your results with other players, no story (I don't count the intro movie), no new cars or new maps. nothing. If you add the fact OutDrive is too easy - you'll have no problem getting over 20+ minutes in single run.\nI can't say graphics is good, cause it is not. But the design is good - lots of neon and polygon-like surronding give this 80's feeling.\nThe part game shines - is the music (not the sounds - they are bad). The OST consists of synth/retro-wave tracks and there are LOTS of them (played for 3 hours and heard the same music once or twice). So if you're a fan of the genre (like I am) you'll have good time listening to it.\nJust like i said - OutDrive reminds me of my old casette player, except it's not broken. It's hard to really accept OutDrive as a game, cause it feels more like WinAmp visualization came to life.\nCan i recommend it? Yes, if you're into that genre of music. For the price it's awesome deal.\nIf you want good racing game and not a BIG fan of such visuals or music - stay away.

Everything is bright blue and purple neon--even the car model used is the quintessentially 80s DeLorean DMC-12. And the music is perfect period synth-pop, excellently composed.\n\nThe "story" is as follows. You're some kind of wheelman for some shady people and the S goes down. Your girl takes a bullet for your sorry butt and somehow (it's not really explained how this works) you connect your car's engine to your girlfriend's heart, which apparently keeps her heart beating. You drive for as long as possible until you foul up. You foul up, the girl dies and the stage ends.  There is no end stage--you go until you can't go any further, then try again to go farther. There really isn't much to this game.\nThe controls are awkward and not customizable, and there is no gamepad support as of this writing (2/23/16).\n\nYou boost to go faster (by holding LShift) and you'll need to be boosting most of the time. Being off boost means the meter that follows your car drops. Dropping too low (to the left) means your girl starts to die--her heart slows down, the music distorts and everything goes gray.  Going too far to the right makes the car overheat (which isn't doing your dying girlfriend any favors either). Roadblocks, jumps and attack choppers will all attempt to slow you down on the endless winding road.\n\nAs I said, the controls are awkward.   WASD to control the car, arrows to control the camera (you will almost never need to use these) LShift to boost and Space to drift.  The WASD controls mean your pinky is left to the boost button, and as I said before you'll be on boost more than you're off. This gets really tiring after a few minutes and it's needlessly awkward.\n\nThe game is unsubstantial and could use some extremely basic additions (like gamepad support, or even the ability to remap controls).  I can't recommend this game at full price. In fact even for what I paid ($1.79) I'm not sure if it's worth the money.","February 23","false","0.7"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

The story outlines a nameless man who gets in trouble with some other nameless men, leading to the first mans girl getting shot and now the only thing he can do to save her is hook her heart up to the engine and keep on driving so she can keep on living. Essentially, the story is very week and should not really be bothered with.\n\nSound:\nThe music in this game is fantastic, no other way to put it. It really helps bring out the neon 80's aesthetic and doesn't get old too fast. The sound effects are serviceable but are nothing special and the acceleration effect can become irritating after awhile.\n\nGraphics:\nAnother thing the game does well is visually present itself. It looks great and the color scheme is perfect for the atmosphere the devs were shooting for. As a side note the launcher itself could have a few more presets. Even though it's a unity game it would be nice to have 8x AA without forcing vsync on as well.\n\nControls:\nThe controls in OutDrive aren't terrible but they don't necessarily feel good. The steering feels rigid and the drifting can be quite fiddly at times, which many times ends up with you smashing into the invisible barriers alongside the road.\n\nGameplay:\nThis is my major gripe with this game. Now, first let me clarify that I understand that the devs were not trying to develop a "game" persay, more of an "experiment" or "aesthetic concept" as the description puts it. That being said, that doesn't excuse OutDrive from having a mechanic that really irritates me and that really is a shame because funnily enough, it's one of the only mechanics in the game. The mechanic in question is the fact that you have to balance out your speed so that your girls heart (which is hooked up to the motor) doesn't overheat or get damaged. On paper this sounds like an excellent idea and I can kind of see where they were going with it. However it means that you can never buildup speed and you must constantly slow down to make sure that your girl doesn't die and end the game. There is also almost no obstacles anywhere and even cornering is ridculously easy due to the slow speed you are forced to move at. This one gripe could be easily be fixed by either eliminating this mechanic all together or just creating a seperate mode where you could drive as fast as you like (hoping the devs add this in the future!).\n\nConclusion:\nI'm going to recommend this even though I don't beleive it's worth the full $3 CAD. For 99 cents I'd pick it up, but anything more and you're bound to be disappointed, as there's only one mode and it gets tiring very quickly. Thanks for reading, and if the devs see this I hope they take my criticism into consideration as I'll be happy to update my review as the game gets updated.","May 4","true","4.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Keep in mind it is just one level, But the aesthetic is fantastic and the music and controls feel right and responsive.\nI had been made aware of OutDrive's exsistance by Hunking love muscle "Jim Sterling" A man with  the gaming dexterity of a manatee. After watching him fumble with the controls and thinking i could do better i decided to purchase. Realising after the first minute that infact the game is far easier to controll than he'd made out, i settled in and really began to enjoy it.\nReading the reviews below i see that many peope think that OutDrive has been plagiarized from another game in development and i have to admit i had to chuckle to myself. Dont get me wrong i clearly see the resemblance. However i have to apreciate the irony of calling out a game for plagiarizing another game who is in turn plagiarizing every good idea and design of the 1980's\nTo the developer of OutDrive.... I love this ! i love the style, i love the feel, i love the sound and i want more!\nPlease continue with this and develop it further. I would apreciate higher quality audio and procedurally generated levels would be great, some other traffic with maybe light car combat i feel would also work. Maybe have a look at "spy Hunter" from the 80's.

I'm not really that interested in who copied who (assuming copying was really done at all) the issue is does it deliver the goods?\n\nThere is a lot of good stuff here, the music and art style is spot on, no one could seriously fault it. The controls are also pretty well done, the drifting feels great in an over-the-top arcade style way. There is a *glaring* lack of controller support. Really hard to understand how that was overlooked in this day and age - hopefully there is a patch at some point because a racing game with keyboard controls is just ridiculous.\n\nThe biggest let down is the lack of any actual gameplay. You have a speed gauge you need to keep not too fast, not too slow. You do that basically by holding down the unlimited boost button, ocassionally letting go to go around corners. There are no levels, checkpoints, objectives (at least none that I found) - anything to really give you a sense of accomplishment.\n\nAll of this needs to be tempered by the price. For the cost of a small cup of coffee I got 10 minutes of vapourwave racing set in a Fantasy Man universe, fair enough - can't complain really. If the dev throws in controller support, a few objectives/levels/whatever, put the price up to about $10, I think they could have a minor hit.","February 25","true","0.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Given the price, I thought the lack of content was fine. It's not much, but still, it's in the low dollar range. There are games with similar depth going for more.\n\nThe soundtrack is phenomenal, and it fits the aesthetics and environment perfectly, which looks great. When I purchased it, and while playing it, I thought it looked incredibly familiar, but I assumed it was because of a Blood Dragon esque game before it, or something Sega related. The retro VHS aesthetics have been done before in a variety of games. And as far as they go, I thought this was a great take on them.\n\nHowever. I realized too late, having already bought the game and written a positive review of it, that it's essentially a direct rip of Power Drive 2000.\n\nAs are others in their more recent reviews starting to notice.\n\nThe similarities are far too many to be a coincidence, and I have issued a refund request out of principle. I recommend that anyone who has bought the game to do the same and I hope no one else falls into this enticing trap.","February 26","false","1.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The entire aesthetic of the world around the track is great, all looks super pretty, gives a good atmosphere, music is fairly good too - it hasn't turned the 80s dial quite all the way to max but it's getting up there.\nIt's comfy, which is all you should really be looking for from this game. The driving has no depth to it, it's all straight forward and super simple, and the course doesn't pose much of a challenge, so it's not the kind of thing you should be picking up if you're looking for that.\nMy main complaints would be the music slowing down when your engine slows down too much - I get the point of it, most of the songs just sound bad slowed down - and the inability to actually save the girl, makes me feel kinda bad everytime she dies.\nFor what it's priced at, if you're looking to just chill and be comfy driving mindlessly for a bit with a good atmosphere, I reckon it's worth it.","February 23","true","0.7"," 9 of 20 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","9","20","0","0"

Despite the controversy around the game that seems to be brewing in the community, the game itself is a pretty relaxing affair with some very stylised and fitting 80's inspired synth-heavy music. Visuals are great and hypnotic and it's pretty nice to just phase out and take it all in. However, the game does play like a poor man's, bare bones Distance. If you're looking for complexity in a racing game such as this, you wont find it here. The gameplay is very limited and would probably bore most gamers after 10 or so minutes.\n\nHowever, I have fallen oddly in love with the game. It's very much an audio/visual experience than it is a video game. Choosing style and [dare I say] aesthetics taking into consideration before gameplay, depth, and plot.\n\nGame would be a lot better if the controller setting were a little more optimised, as using the WASD keys and SPACE to drift around counters does feel a little clunky. Would feel much more smoother and a little more versatile on a controller. I'm pretty sure most of the keys are mapped, but I find that the boost button is off, patch that and I'll be happy.\n\nVaporwave update, when?","February 23","true","4.1"," 9 of 20 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","9","20","0","0"

So even if OutDrive creators was inspired by Power Drive, its nothing wrong bad at it.\nLets spit in every RPG that is not Diablo or Baldurs Gate !?\nYou should all grow up and not be jelly on someone's success.\n\nNow for review;\n\nFor money worth pack of smokes you get very colorful retro/futuristic runner racing game.\nBeatuful colors, 80's beat music, DMC, dying girlfriend... FUN!\n\nAs for gameplay, well duh, your main obejctive is to fast drive so your loved one who is hooked up with wires somehow dont die. On that way you will at start often crash and she will die only by your fault, but later comes bad boys to shoot you and you will encounter many obstacles in front of you.\n\n\nOverall;\nTotaly recommending this to everyone who are hungry to have flash-back back to 80'\nDefinitely worth 2,99\n","February 25","true","3.7"," 20 of 43 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","20","43","0","6"

Keeping up with the speed you're supposed to drive at isn't tough but it is awfully distracting when you bump into walls and the soundtrack slows down.\n\nThe best part about this game is the audio, and to punish the player by pulling them out of the amazing soundtrack they were listening to only because they drifted incorrectly is a terrible mechanic. If they can rework that single problem, I wouldn't mind holding my WASD/space keys down for an hour on this neon lit road towards the neon sun. OutDrive doesn't have controller support  yet, and the game's resolution is a bit hard to get right. I hope that the developers intend to fix this soon because I would love to play this game often.\n\nAlthough I didn't live through the 80's, it definitely has that vibe, and if you enjoyed Hotline Miami, you'll enjoy this game. OutDrive has a lot of potential, and it's a must buy for the current price. The soundtrack itself is worth much more than that, and so are the aesthetics.

Yes they look alike but i find that they can easily stand next to each other in anyone's library.\nI do put an upvote on this one cause at 1.79$ it's pretty fun but i would like to address some problems i didn't think i'll have based on the videos i've seen.\nPros:\n1. Awesome retrowave vibe, alot like PD2000 but with a endless driving mechanic\n2. Based on music and works as a music shop where you can find New Retrowave artist. Hope in the future artist will share music thru this game - also awesome collision detection (when you collide the music slows down like on a bad cassette player)\n3. Intro sequence pretty nice\n4. Car handles smooth and nice\n\nCons:\n1. Lack of options. Should have key bindings since you accelerate with Shift instead of A\n2. Lack of information at the beginning. You should know what the controls are from the start\n3. Lack of controller support, i have yet to find the acceleration button on an xbox controller.\n\nAll in all i think that people should stop attacking the developer who was kind enough to give a bunch of keys even if the game is 1.79$ who is constantly explaining that he did this for his love to retrowave music and not for the money. Also i see a lot of potential if he chooses to work further on some small updates as mentioned above.\n\nSo yeah, i recommend buying it","February 23","true","3.3"," 8 of 24 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","8","24","0","0"

The music slows down when you get to the bottom end of the speedomotor and the sky turns burning red as you reach the high end.

I'm recommending it simply because the developer did put  time in creating this game. He used his skills to get the word out about some new song artists that are trying to make it in this world. However, there's a lot of room for improvement.\n\nThis game seems to be more about the music rather than the actual controls or gameplay.\n\nThe pros:\n-Colorful, and alive background\n-Good music\n-Good concept/story\n-Cool, easy to use UI\n-Easy to pick up/redirect yourself if you get stuck (usually)\n-I do like the concept of when your car stops or crashes, the screen dims (her life is ending if you don't get yer sh#t together man!) and the music slows down. The music will also speed up when your car is overheating.\n-The "life" meter is simple to follow, but has room for improvement.\n\nThe cons:\n-The car (controls) does not handle so well at times. (Sometimes if you hit the wall, your car will spin all the way around, but a pro is that you can easily redirect it) It feels like you're skating on ice.\n-Hard to see road blocks (You may not have enough time to react to it)\n-Having to redo your settings each time you start up the game (gamers usually like their setup to be remembered)\n\nThe developer himself mentions above that this isn't technically a game, but more so a music/aesthetic experiement. I do believe that this "game" has a potential to actually be a game though. If the developer focuses on fixing it or tuning it, I will definitely play more of it in the future. As I said, the concept is very cool. I also believe the game would be better if we didn't have to worry so much about hitting the walls. You run into them quite frequently. (Or maybe I'm just that clumsy?) But I suppose it's better than falling off the track every 30 seconds.\n\n\nNow if you're looking for an inexpensive way to listen to music and enjoy some neon scenery, here you go.\n\nNote: You DO see the helicopter in the game (I found it about 7-8 minutes into my ride, but it isn't too threatening).\n","March 26","true","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The games graphics are damn pretty with a Tron feel to them, and this saves it from the landfill where ET's game is but it is barley worth the price.\n\nPros - Music & Graphic style\n\nCon - Everything else but gameplay was the worst - this could/should have been an Internet free game at best\n\nLastly - Is it worth £1.99....... maybe?

I love the neon aesthetics that it has. I also am a big fan of Synthwave music.  What I  would call this is an "experential" piece of software entertainment. I do not recommend buying it even for the full very low price of $2.99. Maybe if it goes on sale in the range of 50% to 75% off.\n\nIf the dev had incorporated some additonal gameplay dynamics that affected the rythm of the music. Or. if for additional obstacles like other vehicles to avoid, I maybe could have recommended it at the $2.99.\n\nThat being said, I am having a very difficult time giving it a thumbs down. It does feel like something new was attempted here. And how many games out there have Synthwave soundtracks? I would like to see more like this. Maybe a bigger fully fleshed out experience from the dev.

The rip-off games (erhm-- "inspired games" I mean) are released before the actual game.\n\nAside from the drama, here's my quick review:\n\nGRAPHICS:\nGraphics are nice. 80s synth "inspired" art is cool. The palm trees and sun models are pretty nice, but some of the more "original" models, such as the rows of cars and jumps... not so much. For me, the frame rate can be a bit choppy. I would have expected a simple unity game to run a little nicer on my PC.\n\nSOUND:\nThe sound is a major component of this game. The original synthwave tracks are nice to listen to. I would have liked for there to be a sound test present. It's unfortunate that maintaining a consistent speed in the car is difficult, as it fluctuates the track's pitch and tempo as your girl nears death, which happens often. The engine roars and screeching breaks are barely audible for me, but I don't know that I care whether they're loud or not-- I'm here for the music (and not much else, unfortunately).\n\nCONTROL:\nBleh. Doesn't auto-configure for either my Xbox Controller or generic Bluetooth controller (NES30 PRO). The steering is too loose using the keyboard. Drifting takes a little practice. W (or Up), for acceleration, is a really tired setup for steering a car in a video game, one that was proven to be a miserable gaming experience time and time again in the past 30 years of gaming. I would have prefered for a seperate acceleration, and a seperate turbo speed button.\n\nSTORY/REPLAYABILITY\nThe games intro is decent, and the story is short, sweet, to the point, and gives the player inspiration to get into the game. Unfortunately, the only further plot development we receive is a GIRL IS DEAD screen when a game over is reached. A little further development after x amount of minutes of driving would have been nice. Perhaps individual levels for each soundtrack or artist in the game? With only randomly generated tracks and no further plot development, there's little reason to play this game longer than 15 minutes or so. In fact, I think I've spent more time writing up my opinions on the game rather than actually playing it.\n\nVALUE:\nI don't think I'd reccommend satiating your curiousity by paying the $3 asking price to try this title. You could however pick this title up in a bundle as I did, and feel a little bit better about having paid for this game at all.\n\nOVERALL:\nOutDrive has a few standout moments in the introduction, plot, and thumping synthwave soundtrack that are left unenforced by a lack of fun, driven gameplay. As an "experience," as the author of this game wishes to be judged, OutDrive is a middling, uninspired 80s racer, one that has been done better before-- and surely will be again in the future.","April 23","false","0.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Too slow or too fast and she dies.\n\nOne would expect an "endless" kind of game like this to progressivley get harder the longer the player survived but it didn't seem to get harder at all. In fact the game just sort of seemed to repeat itself.\n\nI would reccomend this game but there really just isn't much to reccomend.\nDefinatley google the soundtrack though as that is actually pretty good.","April 25","false","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Controls are bad, feels like you are playing an average (at best) mobile game on the wrong controls.  Music is also not worth mentioning.\n\nIt is nothing like Rad Racer.","April 25","false","3.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I love the neon aesthetics that it has. I also am a big fan of Synthwave music.  What I  would call this is an "experential" piece of software entertainment. I do not recommend buying it even for the full very low price of $2.99. Maybe if it goes on sale in the range of 50% to 75% off.\n\nIf the dev had incorporated some additonal gameplay dynamics that affected the rythm of the music. Or. if for additional obstacles like other vehicles to avoid, I maybe could have recommended it at the $2.99.\n\nThat being said, I am having a very difficult time giving it a thumbs down. It does feel like something new was attempted here. And how many games out there have Synthwave soundtracks? I would like to see more like this. Maybe a bigger fully fleshed out experience from the dev. So thumbs up for the experience.\n\nPS.\nI wouldn't mind seeing a soundtrack edition for this","May 14","true","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
