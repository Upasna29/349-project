You take the role of a lil' gopher as he coordinates his friends to defend their BBQ from hungry dinosaurs. Tower placement is enhanced as each tower has a specific shape and size, requiring you to plan ahead and maximise space with optimal positioning. As the dinosaurs head towards your delicious steaks (or carrots, if you'd prefer!) you're tasked with collecting additional coconuts to create more towers or can even provide support and get involved in the defence itself.\n\nA little undercooked but still tasty and filling.","December 21, 2013","true","9.9"," 29 of 34 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","29","34","0","0"

This is one of my favorite genres - Tower Defense. But also extremely actiony which is normally not my cup of tea. At first, I had a love/hate relationship with the game. It's fun but you really have to be on the ball. Each level is made up of grid squares and each weapon or defensive machine you place on the field has a set number of squares it takes up AND a set shape. You can rotate these but often you'll find there's just no room for what you want to whoop dinos with. You really need to place things strategically and as quickly as possible. It took me a bit to get the hang of rotating things and getting them on the field promptly. And also deciding what I should choose to fill those limited grid squares. However, once I got the hang of it, I couldn't stop playing. It's actually not a complex game - it just takes a bit of practice. And making sure that all 3 of your steaks survive a level is often quite a challenge! I don't believe this game is worth 10 bucks but if you find it on sale and you're a tower defense fan, I recommend it.","November 29, 2014","true","14.1"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","0"

Go Home Dinosaurs! is a simple tower defense game with 3 different worlds. Each world has around 20 levels with different paths and while some of them might prove a challenge it’s all up about finding a decent strategy in order to complete the level. As you advance in the game you will unlock different cards that gives you other types of defenses, some are used to slow down the dinos while others can put them at the starting point or even make them smaller and therefore, weaker.\n\nThe game is pretty much violence free and the bright colours are inviting if you want to play this game side by side with a younger player. In order to promote their own creativity and their decision making skills. The strategy in which tools to choose as well finding the best alternative when spending your coconuts to buy more allies can be a good incentive to play and there’s a decent amount of levels and hours to be spent specially considering the low price (if discounted).\n\nBy the end of each world you will have a final Boss. Each boss is bigger and while slow, he doesn’t stop. Right before your enemies reach your precious steaks you have two sets of dinomite (eh!) that will prevent them from reaching them, however you will lose one steak. If you no longer have this final defense with you it’s game over and in the final bosses this won’t stop them. I finished all the levels while repeating some of them for a perfect level (or because I was failing them) in around 10 hours and I had a fun time with the game. I believe it’s a good choice to play between those heavy AAA titles or just for a quick-short distraction.","November 13, 2015","true","10.4"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","8","8","2","0"

If you think along the same lines, don't stop reading and don't ignore this title. Go Home Dinosaurs! is probably one of the most rewarding games available on Steam and probably one of the best titles to start out with the genre. It has a variety of difficult angles, challening corners, and heart-pounding timing to save your BBQ from threatening Dinos! If the storyline sounds totally ridiculous, just wait until you put a DJ booth down and destroy a dozen Compy via the power of your record scratching. It's supposed to be ridiculous, and loves to point that out about itself! It's a perfect little title to pass the time or bring yourself into a genre you've never thought you'd have the patience for. It has its challenges, but it wouldn't be fun otherwise! Here's your chance to go back in time and send those Dinos home!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/recommended/216090/","mrninjasquirrel","MrNinjaSquirrel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/","1478 products in account","I'm gonna level with you for a moment: I've never had a steak. Growing up with a vegetarian for a mother it was never on the menu, and for whatever reason I've never gone out of my way to eat one now I'm feeding myself. What I gather though is people go a little crazy for them, gophers too for that matter. So you can probably empathize with them when a group of dinosaurs show up to crash their barbecue, leaving no choice but to wage an all out war on the intruders trying to snatch up their lunch.\n\nGo Home Dinosaurs is then the chronicle of their grand struggle, playing out in the form of a cute and colorful tower defense game. If hearing that makes you groan as you remember the dozens of other TD games already in your library, I can relate, but to its credit GHD does a pretty good job of making itself stand apart (in both good and bad ways). The most obvious of these is its charming aesthetic, full of bobblehead characters bouncing around spouting off silly one liners as they proclaim their undying love for grilled cow.\n\nIt also switches up the traditional way in which towers are selected and built, having you first choose cards for each of your towers, which come in various shapes and sizes requiring more forethought in how you plan to position them. This is cool in that it makes each stage feel like a bit of a puzzle, with the towers being the missing pieces you have to try and squeeze in correctly, but it also takes out a large amount of the strategy found in more traditional TD games. Because levels are so tightly wound, it also feels as if there is already a predesignated layout and you are simply trying to figure out what that is. This might not be readily apparent during the first few levels of the game, but pretty soon the difficulty takes a huge spike upwards and makes it almost a requirement to use a select few towers that were seemingly handpicked for a given level.\n\nI was also disappointed with how shallow the mechanics are, with no leveling system for towers, or even the ability to remove towers after you've placed them. Being able to only place a very small number of towers and having to pick them all from the start also created more than a few frustrating moments when I completely ran out or chose more towers than I'd have any hope of placing, as it's difficult to judge any of this before you actually play a level for yourself.\n\nAll the same Go Home Dinosaurs is certainly enjoyable, largely thanks to how adorable it is. If you are looking for a deep and strategic tower defense game, you aren't going to find it here, but what you will is a bunch of ridiculous anthropomorphic gophers cracking jokes and making pop culture references as bands of dinos poor out of caves with the sort of stupid expressions you'd expect from steak obsessed reptiles. If that sounds amusing to you don't hesitate to pick the game up, but if your already shuddering at the thought of their squeaky voices I'd steer clear.","August 12, 2014","true","8.2"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","10","14","0","3"

I dont need to move units around or upgrade them, or even worry of what its going on the other side of the map.\nHere, the strategy rellies on analizing the space, see what units fit and how effective will they be against the shown enemy tipes. Stages are small and rather short and the maximum number of Cards/units is never higher than 10.\n\nThe only issue is that a game like this, clearly made for a young audience, ends up being rather short when it does not increase the difficulty from level to level. So short so, that even after going for the achievements i'm still left with a lot of grinding left to do to reach "Send 10,000 Dinos home"\n\nIn sum, i enjoy the most important things about this game, the mechanics are great, i like the flow of the game, i like how it looks...but Dammit, those Voices are really aggravating!","March 20","true","15.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Towers are all shaped differently and each level is designed in ways to make the player figure out how to place the towers in the limited spaces. There's a couple of active elements to the game as well, you have a main character who can attack enemies in a small aoe around him (an extremley useful tactic if you're going for 3 stars on each level) and collect coconuts, which are the resource for the game.\nI have two issues with the game - One, it's a bit too easy. I three starred every level with little difficulty.  Two, there's very little dinosaur variety. Asides from bosses and one or so regular enemy, the only differences between the enemies are their HP and speed, which is quite disappointing when compared to other TDs. Despite that, it's an enjoyable game, and if you're fan of games like Plants VS Zombies it's worth checking out at the very least.","June 5, 2013","true","9.1"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

And I was not disappointed. Reminds me very much of a casual tower defense like Plants vs Zombies, except the focus is instead on not just choosing defenses that would suit the enemy, but also the playfield as well. Unlike PvZ, the layout of each level is very different, and to position your defenses is somewhat like tetris in that each one has a specific shape, and you can build around the shapes to form the perfect defense. I'd definitely recommend this game to fans of PvZ. It feels similar, yet its very different in playstyle, and I feel it's more challenging.","June 19, 2013","true","13.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I bought it for super cheap and, you know, steam cards (!!!) so I figured it wouldn't hurt to try out a new game in one of my favorite genres. Coming into it, I had assumed that it was going to be a little bit cheesy, a little bit boring and probably something better suited for my four year olds to play than me. Fact is, not only is it all those things but it's also just badly managed. To build the towers you're alotted, you literally don't get enough coconuts (yes, you need coconuts to build) until the last dinosaur has pretty much trampled across your defenses. I'm wondering if the developers have every played a TD game before? Everything that is enjoyable about the usual defense gameplay is startlingly absent in this one.\n\nI know on Steam there's a general attitude of "dude, shut up, it only cost $2" but the fact is, I have a few TD games on my mobile phone that cost less and gave me hours of interesting gameplay.","December 31, 2013","false","1.8"," 6 of 14 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","6","14","0","0"

It's a little different from other TD games because the traps use blocks in different shapes so you can't place one anywhere. There is only one end point. It means you can just focus on one point. Rest assured this is NOT easy at all especially if you have not unlocked the more powerful traps and power ups. And also, you get a cute little guy running around assisting in attacks and picking up coconuts for traps.\n\nThe small size of each map also adds to the challenge because you can’t spam traps and you have to be careful about placement. You CANNOT delete traps you've placed. Before each mission starts the game makes you pick a few traps or power ups using up to 9 slots. You can only use each trap or power up once so you can only have up to 9 traps in the game. If you want power ups, the traps will be even lesser.\n\nThe missions are fun and the maps are interesting and challenging. They are not very big or long to play like other TD games but this means you can just jump in and pop a few rounds. The dinosaurs come in enough variety. However, some dinos are insanely hard to kill unless you use the right traps or find the right combo.\n\nOverall, I would highly recommend this. I'd say this is one of the most entertaining TD games I've played.","June 22, 2013","true","19.6"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","38","3","8","0","3"

It's an adept time-killer for short burst play and there's a large pause button in the top left of the screen.\n\nFor a quick synopsis of the plot itself, you're one gopher in a large clan of gophers and you're having a barbecue. Your neighboring dinosaurs weren't invited this time so they've decided to simply crash the party. This turns the encounter into a tower defense scenario where you and your fellows do what you can to protect long hordes of dinos from eating your food.\n\nThe method is a bit different from other TD games in that the "towers" you place are shaped a bit like Tetris/puzzle pieces, so there's some fun behind where you place your gopher pals along the track the dinos use to reach the grill.\n\nDinosaurs! is pretty enjoyable and cute. The voices from the towers you place (all of them some kind of device staffed by one or more gophers) become grating toward the end of the game, and there are strange spikes in difficulty if you dedicate yourself to only one technique to win. You'll find a few towers function much better than others but don't let that stop you from trying every one.\n\nI bought this in a sale bundle and spent a little over a dollar on it, and got more than my money's worth. If you like the tower defense genre and don't mind colorful games or  LOTS OF  gopher puns, get it here or toss it on your phone/tablet.","January 12, 2015","true","17.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The player uses cocounts (currency) to purchase permanent installations (gunners, traps), power-ups, and bombs (as represented by cards).  The player is mobile across the board, collects coconuts from trees, and can fire upon the dinosaurs freeley within range.  The foundations of the installations have tetris-esque shapes, which you need to fit around the shape of the path.  There are a good amount of variation of dinosaurs the players will face, all with variations of speed and armor (no attacks).  Controls are very simple, only using a mouse and a spacebar.\n\nThat being said, the game is very cartoonish, making a strong appeal towards a younger audience.  Don't be fooled though.  The later levels are very puzzling and require a good amount of finess (I stress finess more than puzzle detail).  The overall difficulty is definitely harder than Plants vs. Zombies (coming from a guy who broke level 100 in PvZ survival).  For those who really love the challenge, there are Steam achievements for completing certain levels using only specific cards.  Even with the high difficulty factor, I still encourage anyone (seriously, anyone) who loves tower defense games (or just PvZ) to play it.  It really is a fun casual game.","January 14, 2014","true","4.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/blinkenlights1/recommended/216090/","blinkenlights1","Noddy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/blinkenlights1/","690 products in account","As a parent, my kids found Go Home Dinosaurs on U-tube, after watching lots of otherwise mostly educational dinosaur videos.  If you can get the game on sale, you will get it at $2.50 - then I need 3 copies because I like to vet the games first - then little brother CANNOT miss out on what big brother has.  Anyway this game has been very good value for the kids.\n\n"Tower defense" is the proper name for this type of game - that means stop the baddies reaching your castle/home/nest- or in this case barbecue.  The baddies in this game are cutsie dinosaurs.  The kids earn coins during the game which they can spend in the in-game shop (no real money changes hands) mostly to buy new outfits for their character.  The shop keeper is comic - I was really caught on the back foot when my son asked what moustache wax was - he had heard "shoppy" say that that was not for sale!\n\nI used to be quite an accomplished Gamer back when everything was coin operated - not so much now.  I disagree with those that say this game is "easy" and "basic".  It can get quite hard, and my kids did get frustrated at points, retrying the same level (they DO have the choice to just go play another level, which is great).  It was interesting to see strategies emerge - you can let dinosaurs reach your barbie twice - only on the the third time do you lose the level.  One of my sons rigorously defends his barbecue from all-comers.  My other son concentrates on building his defences and only goes all out to defend the barbie on the third time around.\n\nAnother tower defence game that a lot of kids play is plants versus zombies.  Both games have their merits - and PVZ is certainly a lot more well known.  I would say Go Home Dinosaurs is a lot more parent-acceptable.\n\nThis game will keep them entertained for hours during those cold winter months (I write this from Australia) until we actually start having real barbecues again.  I recommend it.  PS Parents should play as well - yeah, like you have any free time ...\n","June 25, 2014","true","2.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you can get the game on sale, you will get it at $2.50 - then I need 3 copies because I like to vet the games first - then little brother CANNOT miss out on what big brother has.  Anyway this game has been very good value for the kids.\n\n"Tower defense" is the proper name for this type of game - that means stop the baddies reaching your castle/home/nest- or in this case barbecue.  The baddies in this game are cutsie dinosaurs.  The kids earn coins during the game which they can spend in the in-game shop (no real money changes hands) mostly to buy new outfits for their character.  The shop keeper is comic - I was really caught on the back foot when my son asked what moustache wax was - he had heard "shoppy" say that that was not for sale!\n\nI used to be quite an accomplished Gamer back when everything was coin operated - not so much now.  I disagree with those that say this game is "easy" and "basic".  It can get quite hard, and my kids did get frustrated at points, retrying the same level (they DO have the choice to just go play another level, which is great).  It was interesting to see strategies emerge - you can let dinosaurs reach your barbie twice - only on the the third time do you lose the level.  One of my sons rigorously defends his barbecue from all-comers.  My other son concentrates on building his defences and only goes all out to defend the barbie on the third time around.\n\nAnother tower defence game that a lot of kids play is plants versus zombies.  Both games have their merits - and PVZ is certainly a lot more well known.  I would say Go Home Dinosaurs is a lot more parent-acceptable.\n\nThis game will keep them entertained for hours during those cold winter months (I write this from Australia) until we actually start having real barbecues again.  I recommend it.  PS Parents should play as well - yeah, like you have any free time ...\n","June 25, 2014","true","2.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Great for a casual gamer especially.  It is not particularlly hard to beat all three worlds (which have about 20 levels each in them I believe) but it is increasingly hard to get three stars in them all.  It gets more and more hectic as you go along.\n\nIt's very colorful and has great animation.
