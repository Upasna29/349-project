That will be more fun to play with than this game...\n\nThis is not a game, it is a cryengine map.\n\nThe only plus of it, is that cryengine allows the forest in the middle to look somewhat nice if you ignore the floating grass that is around.\n\nAll the game consists of, is walking around a dull maze, finding 8 pressure plates, and then finding the exit.\n\nYou are even able to just fly around the map if you press f4 to go into flymode (Intended for developer use)\n\nI bought this game because i enjoyed maze runner, and thought i'd give it a shot.\n\nBut seriously, dont buy this game in its current state. It is a waste of both money and hard drive space. (4.5 Gig for this? Wow)","February 16","false","0.3"," 113 of 123 people (92%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","92","113","123","14","5"

It is a tech demo, and not a well-presented one. There is potential here, but it needs a surprising amount of work.

On other side, it help you relax.\nIn general, I enjoyed game play and recommend it to buy.","February 17","true","0.5"," 10 of 33 people (30%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","30","10","33","8","0"

For the money I got the most out of the graphics and the overall quality of performance. I'm excited about "The Maze Runner" and when bumped into this game immediately realized that I had to buy it.\nYou know, I have not regretted spent $ 4. Maybe the game does not live up to all my expectations, but I like a real fan of "The Maze Runner" has received a lot of fun playing.\nFor me, this game was like a casino in Los Angeles, you do not worry about the wasted time or money, you just play and enjoy.\nIn general, if you're a fan of "The Maze Runner" or just a lover and want to have a good time without a heavy load story - buy it! It's really worth it!","February 16","true","0.8"," 5 of 23 people (22%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","22","5","23","2","0"
