It doesn't hold your hand at all. The game wants you to build a shelf? How about some messed up looking modern art instead? The choice is yours. I had fun messing around in this game, but obviously it's not going to be for everyone.\n\nPros:\n- Do whatever the hell you want.\n- There's a bunch of tools so you can modify the furniture to make it "better."\n- Lovely soundtrack and a very clean visual style.\n\nCons:\n- Very hard to actually build things.\n- Controls may be frustrating, although that's part of the game's charm","May 29, 2015","true","2.0"," 49 of 54 people (91%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","91","49","54","8","0"

The sandbox mode (called 'Form' in the game) can be a blast with a few friends, and the building challenge(s) are great for solo play. Definitely recommended at this price, and more features promised within the next few months is a bonus.\n\nPros:\n- Really entertaining w/ a few friends\n- Funny premise and furniture titles\n- Challenge(s) are great, show potential\n- Sandbox mode gives free roam for creative designs\n\nCons:\n- It's early access.. so there's not a ton of content just yet\n\nYou could call it 'furniture building simulator' or '[redacted for legal reasons swedish furniture store] simulator', but that's kind of missing the point. It's pretty clear from the start that the objective is to be as creative as possible, not to assemble things by instructions (actually, there are no instructions). The game doesn't currently rate you by how well you built anything or whether it looks anything like the box your furniture came in- the point was to have free roam instead of linear objectives. Building things the way they are supposed to look becomes difficult fairly quickly, so instead I tend to build pseudo versions of that piece or make robots. I could see the benefit of a mode that rates your creations against what's on the box in a future update, but ultimately that would be to give the player more choices on top of the really entertaining modes that are already there. In the 'form' mode, which is like a sandbox, you can order new pieces from the catalog. The boxes float in and, once you open them, the pieces spill out. There are pegs and holes to line up in any way that you wish, and up to five people can join you. In the sandbox mode, having a few friends around really helps. While messing with pieces and trying in vain to coordinate with friends, I was reminded of great couch co-ops like New Super Mario and the like. Things can quickly turn into a hysterical yelling match as two people with best intentions create a monstrosity of a bookshelf, while the guy at the other end of the couch chases them with a mallet. It's a blast.\n\nThe 'function' mode gives you challenges by which you must build furniture to meet a stated objective (there's only one challenge now, but it's pretty clear that more will be added). This mode is great for solo play, and really shows the potential that could be had with the elements of the game. Group play definitely works here too, as long as you don't have a rogue friend with a mallet destroying your hard work (ask me how I know)..\n\nI play with a Xbox 360 controller. It seems this was the intention of the devs (there are pics of 360 controllers in the initial loading screen). I briefly used a touchpad when some friends were over and, while it works, it wasn't how I'd recommend playing. There's a slight learning curve to figuring out the best way to rotate pieces, but it's pretty straightforward and easy to pick up. The cursor movement pace speeds up and slows down depending on what you're holding, which really helps when you're lining up pegs to put together. Basically, controllers work best and buttons are simple and intuitive.\n\nOverall, I'm really glad I picked this up. It's great to see more games like this available on steam that focus on local coop (because yes, some PC gamers like that). Definitely happy with the current state, and very much looking forward to where this thing goes.","May 29, 2015","true","3.8"," 29 of 33 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","29","33","0","0"

I find it brilliant when people make really fun games about mundane activities. I played this with three people and it plays like a really challenging (yet lovely) puzzle game. It is basically an IKEA simulator. You get DIY furniture and have to figure out how to assemble it. Its really difficult. I don't think I have made anything perfectly yet.\n\nPros:\n+Full controller support\n+Really nice artwork and overall ambience (i.e. you can adjust the lights and play with everything in the rooms)\n+Plenty of content so far (three rooms plus sandbox and a community challenge)\n+Music is great\n\nCons:\n-Not a big deal, but it would be nice to have a zoom function for those small parts when I am playing from the couch\n\nOverall, this is totally worth the small asking price. I will definately be playing a good bit of this.\n","May 31, 2015","true","2.7"," 16 of 17 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","16","17","0","0"

I load it up and am immeadiately met with an atypical menu. Figure out the menu and join my friend in the attic. Immeadiately break everything, figure out a glue gun, I find out that if two people click to connect things at the same time oblivion happens. I host the game after some very annoying bugs happen.

Made me wanna go to Ikea and put my newfound table building skills to test. But then I realised I had crossed the line and delved into some sort of sadistic table craving weirdo mentality. y'know, the kind who hangs around furniture stores breathing really heavily whilst shaking...\n\nBefore you buy this game, know that It is really only meant to be played with friends. So first off, you're gonna need to find some friends... You'll also be needing a few controllers to play with, I suggest Xbox controllers, as I found difficulties using PS4 and WiiU Pro controllers!\n\nOnce you and your mates are all sat down armed with virtual hammers and nails then you can get started creating wooden abominations that truly are things of nightmares. The game is basically split into two modes. In one you can choose a room in a house, Garage, Living room, etc... Now you can open up an Ikea-esque manual and choose what you want to "try" and construct. Upon choosing, parts will rain from the sky! Now comes the tricky part. Using the tools given to you, you and your friends will now need to put said pieces into place. The problem being, that the end product may not look anything like what was on the box. This is great fun to ♥♥♥♥ about on with some mates.\n\nThe second gamemode is a party mode, which will yet again see you and your friends testing your new found powers. Things in this gamemode include stacking parts like a big game of Jenga, and whatnot. This is kinda a secondary afterthought of a gamemode, which serves as a little extra bit of fun after you've had your fill of the actual game.\n\nWould I recommend this? If you have some friends who are willing to shout and scream at eachother over table legs and who keeps dropping the priceless vase then yes, this game is great. I'm not entirely sure if it would be worth buying to play alone though, this game really lives and dies on the fact that people will be playing from the couch all talking and laughing.","June 6, 2015","true","1.2"," 13 of 17 people (76%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","76","13","17","9","0"

Object rotation isn't sure whether to observe local or global positioning, so two attempts to make the same mouse motion or joystick press yield weird results.\n\nComparing the assembly time of the LACK corner table in real life, and the BORK corner table in game... it was about two minutes faster to assemble LACK than it was BORK.
