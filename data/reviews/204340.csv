Oh! You got the good ol' enemy variety as well, with the return of the Kamikazes and kleer skeletons, my favorite so far is that, and the Rhino Cybertoy, which replaced the Sirian Werebull.\n\nThe main complaint I hear that Serious Sam 2 is too cartoony. My response to that is... I love it! I can see more of Serious Sam series as a more cartoony series than a realistic series. Instead of being in a episode of one specific area like ancient and modern egypt. It's actually a lengthy and fun game, as I said, this game has 42 levels, and the levels are diverse. It feels colorful as well, given the cartoony feel.\n\nThere are many aresenals this game has to offer, such as turrets, more guns from the previous games, and vechicles (What happened to that in Serious Sam 3?!). You can use any weapon of your choice to kick butt, like I would use the double barrel shotgun, and other weapons to fight against enemies!\n\nA great game!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PrivateGodfrey/recommended/204340/","PrivateGodfrey","Captain MooMoos","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PrivateGodfrey/","490 products in account","This is a long review so if you just want a brief summary of why I recommend Serious Sam 2 then skip to Results and read from there.\n\nSerious Sam 2 is a fun game that offers more ridiculous combat, but drifts a little too far from the Serious Model to be called ‚ÄúGreat‚Äù. After the success of the original Croteam had a higher budget to put towards Serious Sam 2; sadly, Serious Sam 2 takes a path similar to the Martix 2 where an increased budget leads to a worse product. The game albeit fun has some additions which take away from the hilarity and well-crafted elements that made the series great.\n\nStory:\nSerious Sam finally meets the Sirians, the race that in the future Mental destroyed before his attack on humanity. The Sirians noticed Sam‚Äôs serious combat skills from the First and Second encounter so they portal him to their ship. It is there that they tell him of his prophecy, to defeat Mental and free the universe.  To do this Sam must venture to five planets and acquire the five pieces of the medallion. Only then will he be able to weaken mental and eliminate him once and for all. His quest will take him to five planets  in order to retrieve the pieces of the medallion from four tribes: the Simbas, Zixies, Chi Che, and Elvians. It is up to Sam to either save each of these groups from Mentals oppression and retrieve their medallion pieces.\n\nCampaign:\nSerious Sam 2 is divided into seven planets: M‚Äôdigbo, Magnor, ChiFang, Kleer, Ellenier, Kronor, and Serius. The campaign consists of a whopping forty-two levels (including boss fight levels). Unlike the First and Second Encounter some of the levels are not nearly as long or engrossing.\n\nGameplay:\nSimilar to the previous titles of Serious series the difficulty curve is well managed, where you can make it ridiculously hard or meticulously difficult. Serious Sam 2 introduces new weapons, and battle concepts. You can now get 200 health/armor by picking up any health packs (unlike the original where you could only go over 100 if you found special health/armor packs). By allowing you to get 200 health/armor Serious Sam 2 really builds upon the originals gameplay by giving you more control in how you will fight, but this is short lived as the weapon choices and ammo limitations dampen the combat. You will rarely find ammo throughout the campaign, and when you do you will burn through it without being able to find more. I found myself using the Auto Shotgun and Double Shotgun almost the entire campaign as I never had enough ammo for the other weapons.\n\nUpon venturing to new planets you lose all your items, meaning you have to start collecting weapons all over again. This would be fine, but I noticed in M‚Äôdigbo I only acquired nine of the fourteen weapons. Every time you start a new level you revert back to 100 health and lose your armor. This means if you performed well on the previous level all is in vain because you losing all your work anyway. You also have lives in this game, so you may think you are reloading a past save but actually its putting you back at a checkpoint with one less life.\n\nHints:\n>Save between each area, then if you die load your save (this way you don‚Äôt lose lives).\n>Save your ammunition in the first and second planets (after the first two planets, ammunition is plentiful).\n>Forget about ending the level with full health/armor (you lose your health/armor between levels).\n>Make sure you load your campaign from the save files (as you lose any lives you acquired earlier otherwise).\n>Make sure when you die to reload from the save file (if you just click continue it will revert you back to the last checkpoint and you will not have the armor/ammo/health you had when you actually got to the checkpoint).\n>If your level glitches, try saving and reloading the level right where you saved. (This can cause the enemies to spawn allowing you to get past enemy kill-count triggers related issues)\n>On the second planet level ‚ÄúForsaken Compound‚Äù is known to glitch on Hard or Serious Difficulty. If the rocket launcher does not spawn after you get right across the bridge your level has glitched and you need to restart.\n\nResults:\nSerious Sam is an epic first person shooter series that pushes the limit and then takes it further. The action is amazing, the bosses are intense, and the enemies are plentiful. You won‚Äôt be solving any puzzles in this one, but instead you will be gunning down the masses. There are five planets; each planet has its own unique design and unit models. The campaign offers loads of different elements that make you want to push on, making each level more epic than the last. If you want a realistic game this is not for you, but if you don‚Äôt mind going crazy having a good time Serious Sam 2 is the game for you. I would get this with the Serious complete back (only if you can grab it on sale). Honestly if you just want to try out a new game $9.99 is a little high for this game.\n\nPros:\n+Interesting new enemies, some which play off the originals and some that are completely unique.\n+Introduction of vehicles (makes some of the levels a little more serious).\n+Secrets are more amusing\n+Six separate planets to visit all with their quirks.\n+Enemies have themes to match their locations.\n+Levels offer much more variation in play-style and ambience.\n+More bosses which require various tactics to defeat.\n+Fun, explosive, and fast paced gameplay that keeps you wanting more.\n+Netrisca can talk (you still have to read some things, but she will just tell you major clues).\n+Ability to have multiple profiles, so if you are sharing a computer you can easily switch between other individuals campaigns.\n+Blasting thousands of enemies to bits as you run around like a true action hero.\n+Lots of nostalgia!!!!\n\nCons:\n-Poor cinematic quality (it‚Äôs as if the cinematics are actually lower quality than the gameplay).\n-Introduction of allies (you never needed them before ‚Äì why now?)\n-You lose your weapons upon starting up at a new planet (although this occurs also between campaign transitions in TSE the campaign for Serious Sam 2 connects each planet into a single campaign).\n-You have lives (you never had lives before this)\n-You always start each level with 100 health (regardless of whether you had more or less at the end).\n-Some of the levels have bugs, which force you to restart the level.\n-You lose Serious Bombs between levels.\n-There is not one point in the campaign where you have every single weapon at one time. (Except for on the final level)\n-Levels are nowhere near as large as TFE or TSE.\n-Awful dialogue (attempts to be funny, but falls short atleast for me)\n-Too childish (the game has cartoonish unit models that take away from the Serious in Serious Sam)","July 1, 2014","true","22.2"," 48 of 54 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","48","54","0","0"

Many dislike where it went, but I really enjoy the outcome of the game.\nThe graphics are cartoonish and very bright and really make a difference to the earlier titles and the chosen music and sound assets are pretty awesome. Just the the music of some levels is worth the money. And the cutscenes? Those are pretty yanky but also pretty hilarious, although they suffer a bit from pretty high compression artifacts.\nThe gameplay has not really changed fro the earlier titles. You come to an area, doors close, you slauther a bunch of enemies and just continue to the next section. It might sound boring, but the level design really hides those 'grindy' parts.\nThe arsenal is also pretty much the same as in 'The First Encounter' or 'The Second Encounter', just updated and added some cool twists (exploding birds, hand grenades).\n\nSo all in all, if you like the previous titles and like games of this genre you might like this one too.","October 13, 2014","true","24.6"," 27 of 31 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","27","31","0","0"

The game also has an awesome soundtrack, which makes you turn the volume all the way up. If you're an old Serious Sam games fan and didn't played this game because of how it looks, well, you missed quite a lot. This game is made to not be taken serious ( which is ironical ), it has a lot of cheesy humor and cutscene videos, you can adapt to the whole humor of the game through little bit of gameplay, and it's one of the reasons i love Croteam, they can mix that stuff together into one amazing thing. It's more arcadey ( especially on low difficulty levels ) than other SS games, yet it's still tons of fun. This is one of the most played games of my childhood, and i still play it with huge enjoyment over and over again. If this ever get an HD remake ( it already looks great with some console variables tweaks ) i will 100% buy it. I would recommend it for people which don't take games seriously while having huge enjoyment out of them.

This might sound a little strange but part of the charm of the original Encounters were their simplicity. They were the most first person shooter you had ever seen in a first person shooter. Their success has now lead Croteam to develop Serious Sam 2 with some loftier goals in mind and unfortunately this only makes the game worse for wear.\n\nThe first new introduction you'll get is to the storyline which now takes a front seat in the game together with cut-scenes. Both are unfortunately very poorly made and do nothing to pull you further into the game. On the contrary the constant breaks in the action where you have to sit around and watch Sam try to be funny ruins the pace of the game and makes the dreaded boredom begin to set in.\n\nSam was always a funny character in the originals. In the same way that Duke was fun back in Duke 3D. The cute little adolescent one liners made you giggle a little in between stomping out alien scum. In Serious Sam 2 however these one liners have been ramped up and pushed into the cut scenes and the increased intensity of the, coupled with the fact that you are no longer playing the game when they happen, you are sitting around waiting for the cut scene to end, means that you will begin to get sick of them very quickly.\n\nSerious Sam 2 does maintain some the good qualities too and make a few cool additions of it's own. The weapons are still fun and varied, sound great and feel great. The levels are still massive with hordes of enemies and an absolutely absurd amount of color thrown in there to offset the modern shooter's often too heavily reliance on brown and grey.\n\nThe enemies look great and are every bit as varied and insane as in the original, everything from headless bombers to giant American footballers and psycho clowns on unicycles.\n\nAll in all Serious Sam 2 isn't a bad game. Underneath it all it still got everything that made the First and Second Encounters so enjoyable. It's just picked up some bad habits which hurt the overall feel of the game.","June 7, 2013","true","36.0"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","14","16","0","0"

Sam‚Äôs task is to somehow change the timeline by defeating a mysterious alien warlord called Mental and his vast army of minions. To accomplish this, he is armed with a gigantic arsenal, including every cheesy 80s action movie one-liner ever written.\n\nExcept for this game. Because Serious Sam 2 is about an idiot running around at the order of three midgets to gather the pieces of a cheap amulet from the clutches of witches, zombie lawyers, cigar-smoking dinosaurs, monocycling clowns, and other cartoonish enemies.\nIt is true that the series always had some infantile humour, but mostly in the form of secrets or the occasional random occurrences. Here, the dumbness is the main attraction, and it was so contagious that it swallowed the brains of the level designers too. The non-linear courtyards and arenas that characterise the other games are replaced with 10-15 minute long corridors. The only time the game opens up is when it showcases how well it stole vehicle riding segments from Halo 1-2.\n\nThere are only a few redeeming factors. Starting from the fourth world, the levels start to almost feel like an actual game, not just a bad engine tech demo. Also, even the bad stages have an astonishing amount of detail at almost every corner, so at least they are pretty to look at. Very pretty: CroTeam made a great job with Serious Engine 2. While originally it was a demanding beast, by today‚Äôs standards, it is old yet still looks stunning for its age. Well, apart from the physics engine, but thankfully the terrible physics are just for show (except for getting a few secrets).","February 1","true","13.1"," 23 of 34 people (68%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","68","23","34","4","2"

Having said that, I am enjoying it so far. The graphics hold up well, perhaps a benefit of the crisp and vibrant art style. The environments are very colorful and imaginative and a joy to explore (even though the game is not particularly open-but more on that later). Though a Serious Sam title, this particular installment shares little with its predecessors- it's brighter, less serious and seemingly more kid-friendly (older siblings and parents take note, this game still contains excessive violence and "adult" subject matter, but on the whole seems more like a "T-rated" game than an M). Also, the gameplay is more akin to the recent Shadow Warrior reboot than the original Sam titles (which is a good thing in my opinion)-the levels are big and spacious but at the same time very linear; progression is from one area to the next, broken up by cutscenes. The shooting is fast and fluid, as you'd expect from a Serious Sam game, and generally pretty fun. Oh, and you can ride dinosaurs (I would have tried this but I killed mine accidently). But by far the most striking aspect of the game is its tone, and if you come into this as a veteran from the originals, prepare for a shock. This is not necessarily a bad thing, though, and from the little I've played of this game so far, I can tell it fills a unique niche that the others do not-namely, a creepy early 2000s CGI young adults' action adventure/scifi movie/ Conker's Bad Fur Day-type "adult masquerading as kid-friendly" niche (I guess that sort of thing was popular in the early 2000s). So anyways, those are my early insights, but I'll have to play more and perhaps I'll have more to say. Despite the frankly idiotic story, I recommend this game, for now.\n\nUpdate: I played a little more and the charm of the game really took hold. The story is even beginning to grow on me (Sam's horrific one liners are not, however). Honestly, I'm surprised that Serious Sam 2 manages to look and play as well as it does on modern hardware, so that's a good thing. I prescribe this an an antidote for Call of Duty.\nHighly Recommended","January 6, 2015","true","1.8"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","86","12","14","6","0"

Do I really love senseless killing? Do I really like straight forward, no fooling around, linear maps and repetitive tasks?\n\nIf you answered yes to those, then this game is for you.\n\nI remember that my cousin used to own this game, I saw the cover, but I never got to play it, until now.\nNow...\n\n+ The humour of this game might be corny at times, but at least I feel like it's well executed, it did make me laugh more than one time.\n\n+The controls are fluid enough, you can jump and aim with ease, handling the guns itself is simple and self explanatory.\n\n? The music gets kinda repetitive after a while, mostly because the combat music seems to be the same between each stage of each chapter, it drills your brain and stays there like dental caries.\n\n+ The visuals, for an old game like this, are pretty good. The skybox are those dreaded "Far away, yet leaning towards you" buildings and mountains. Everything looks rather smooth, to be honest, no slowdown, no matter how many enemies there are on my screen.\n\n-/+ Difficulty wise, it might be unforgiving for noobs at times, like me. But eh, I don't really think about this as a flaw if you love a great challenge.\n\n\n- This is a fatal flaw in my opinion, that kinda makes the experience a bit lacking for me. I dunno about the other Serious Sam games, because this is the first one I get to play. But this game, is monotonous as all hell. Basically, you move to a room, fight 40 enemies in an open area, move into the next one, fight 60 in an open area, move into yet another room, fight 50 more again. Over, and over, and over, and over. Occasionally, you get to mow down enemies with a machine gun or something like that, but guess what? Open area, enemy wave. Over. And over. And over. Make it stop.\nI wouldn't mind fighting 20 or so enemies per room, but sometimes, it gets ridiculous, what's worse, there are some areas full of helicopters, demons with missile launchers, headless kamikazes or orc football players, you get your ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• blasted from every single direction. I actually had to move and reach the checkpoint, because the enemies wouldn't stop coming. As soon as I was dead, I respawned, there were no enemies to be found. Give me a break.\n\n\nAll in all, it's one of those games that, even if I do not like them that much, I'd still recommend it to people who are into mindless action packed shooters. It's a good game, just doesn't hit the nail on the head for me. And it's waaaaaay too repetitive. Give it a try, and judge for yourself.","February 20, 2015","true","3.7"," 13 of 21 people (62%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","62","13","21","6","0"

As much as I love it in this game I'd prefer not to see it ever again in any other Sam games. It works well enough here, but this game is more than enough for it!\n\nAs of the music: This is my favorite "Sam Soundtrack" and nothing can surpass it, mostly because of it's overall diversity. This was the first Sam game I've ever played from beginning to end and because of this, Undercode's As Above So Below was always "Cecil's tune" in my book. Such a track fits a ferocious dragon more than some mutant larva anyway. xD\n\nOverall it's a great game and the perfect example of how Croteam acknowledges feedback from the fans.

But it has a nice arcade shoot em' up feel to it. However, they sometimes throw way too many enemies at you, without a break. It's really annoying to deal with 100 enemies with only 50 HP left, and after killing them off (but dying twice) then finding a nice lil' keyboard, jumping on it for fun, then 2 enemies to jump from behind me and kill me with my last life. Now, it does get boring with a overuse of the same enemies being thrown at you, the envirornments in this game are well varied. A lot a very nicely done in fact, really impressed with some of them. However, the cutscenes feel rushed, with very little acting skills in it, like they weren't even trying. Finally, the weapons. Besides the gun that's ripping off the Halo plasma pistol, the weapons are pretty great, I love the Sniper Rifle and Plasma Rifle, the dual pistols are great for picking off enemies at a distance, while the roceket launcher is good to deal with large enemies, or do all out carnage and blow everything up.

It looks (especially on higher resolutions, where the game doesn't scale well) and plays much worse than original Encounters.\nI can dig into changed tone and cartoon worlds, but not in a game that is about running in circles and killing hundreds and thousands of enemies. While the image of hell hordes of gore in Encounters and SS3 simply involves you into it, where hipster blood is there as an option for a second to enjoy, the SS game doesn't works if the whole game is filled with pastel colours straight from the Smurfs. And characters from Smurfs - killing over and over cartoon witches, goblins, natives having sex in bushes and finding a poop in a yard gets boring very quickly.\nSound assets surely don't help the game in that matter. The happy-go tracks that don't build any tension whatsoever make the boredom come even sooner. They're just so out of place and situation for most of the time.\nWeaponry feels and sounds weak, with the only exception of double barrel shotgun. The rest of it gets boring really quickly and I almost never used any besides occasional rocket launcher and sniper rifle. I didn't get far into the game, but the slow pace of introducing new challanges and weapons made me not to care about what's further in the game. I found the cannon in the first episode/arc and never used it. Why to bother playing it when you can dig into Encounters or SS3? Now I know there is no reason at all of doing so.\n\nAlso, often crashes and sound problems are irritiating.","December 9, 2014","false","4.3"," 20 of 36 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","20","36","0","0"

Normal in SS2 feels more like hard in SS1 a lot of the time and the tricks up the dev's sleeves perform nicely and will have you strategizing more than shooting on various occasions.\n\nThe weapons have a pleasant, balanced feel to them that encourages you to get creative and never have an ultimate go-to. Yes some weapons are of course better for certain situations than others, but seldom will you feel like you'd be screwed if you didn't have ammo for a specific weapon. The Devs are good about giving you the ammo you need, and you see ammo packs, large health and powerups much more often in this installation of the series making way for big fights equally more often.\n\nEnemies are what you'd expect, but there's some awesome additions especially ranged enemies. In the first game, most of the ranged attacks were projectiles but in SS2 there's more rockets and more bullets to force you to kill fast, fast fast and prioritize targets effectively if you want to stay alive for long. Also, there's more strategy involved in taking down enemies this time around. One of the first enemies has a shield that it'll drop when you shoot it, but I'm pretty sure making contact while before it drops the shield does more damage. I'm not positive about that though. Either way, more strategy difficulty and satisfaction.\n\nThe environments are pretty epic and vary just enough to keep you happy without getting overly obnoxious. There's moments where you say "Damn, this game had amazing graphics for it's time" and it did, not only that, but the engine is super optimized. I have a pretty aweful system and I'm very impressed by how well I can run the game.\n\nSerious Sam 2 has stupid humor that made me laugh and facepalm simultaniously. You have to not take it seriously, and with the massive amount of bloodshed that goes into this game, the comic style of the game and it's visual design is commendable on the part of the Dev's. I will say that I prefered the darker style of SS1 but where this game lacks in any area for me it makes up for in gameplay. The gameplay is just awesome.\n\nThis game is satisfyingly challenging, fun, surprisingly not repetetive for the very basic concept behind it, and goes down in my book as a must-have for fans of games like oldschool doom, painkiller, and other doom clones including serious sam 1.\n\nI'd pay $20 for this game, and I paid $10. Maybe I'm a sucker for games like these, but if I am then I gladly sucked this game right up and I give this a total of 7/10. Not bad for a game that's literally like: Here's baddies, here's gun, here's excuse oops I mean story, go kill. *Pounds chest*.","November 25, 2014","true","13.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Foxysen/recommended/204340/","Foxysen","Foxysen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Foxysen/","1172 products in account","Serious Sam 2 is a first proper sequel to original Serious Sam, a horde-based FPS. It was made by Croteam and came out in 2005. And just look at how cartoonish it looks by comparison!\nIt was also released for the original Xbox. Compared to it, you don't really miss anything. It had multiplayer only up to 4 players. And then it wasn't exactly finished version, as I heard that it lacks the final boss.\nAnd yep, it's still being updated to this day occasionally. Because Croteam. Did you know that original retail version of a game had no deathmatch and chainsaw wouldn't break crates, instead just pushing them until they fall through the floor, showcasing the horrible physics? Now you know.\nIt also comes with Insamnity 2 spam-mod already included.\n\nTechnically, it should be fine. However try not to leave your game at the level 6, where you rescue shaman from the prison. It seems that profiles get damaged if it's the last level played. But who knows.\n\nMultiplayer community is still alive. Well, cooperative gamemode, where you can get some players. Absolutely no one playes deathmatch. You can undestand them, the netcode in this Serious Sam was awful.\n\n\nAnd well, what can I say, Sam is once again mowing down the hordes of enemies in chase for Mental and all the medallion pieces in his serious quest. Very serious. So serious that...\n"What the hell is this cartoonish THING"?!\nSays every player after being greeted by chubby blue alien humans with huge monkey ears, brown plush bull toys with rotating key sticking out and laughing fat-fat-fat kamikaze orc clown holding two cakes with tnt candles and riding unicicle, having a beautifully wide big green rear, putting those Serious Engine 2 reflective surfraces technology to a good use. A showcase so terrifying that it never was licensed by anybody else.\nYea, it sure wasn't Serious Sam 1 anymore, which still made you feel that you are fighting evil, despite fun secrets.\n\nThat, and it wasn't much of a good type of cartoonish. Instead it was combination of ugly characters and weak feeling of combat. And yep, it felt weak, from the way that weapons handled, enemies dropped lazily onto ground and sound effect never have any "boom" to it. How could they make feel uzi akimbo like a pea shooters, I do not know. Sure made me miss the Thompson gun from the first game. There was almost no gore, no blood decals would be left on scenery. Monsters blow up uneventful, gibs dissabearing in a mere second.\nSeriously, blowing up a bag of flour with a flashbang grenade would be more satisfying than what we have here.\n\nOh, and physics sucked and those secrets where you are supposed to make a stair out of boxes can burn in the Kleer Planet's lava. Good thing it's barely used for gameplay.\n\nThat, and the way that original retail version didn't come with Serious Editor and that this game has no split-screen multiplayer were the reasons why I abandoned it shortly after playing it at the launch despite being Serious Sam 1 fan at that time.\n\n\nBut after long time passed and finally replaying this again, it's actually a pretty damn good Serious Sam game. Mind, those flaws are still there. But I can see that there is more to it. And it has fun with it's setting, as you will travel over 7 different episodes, each with it's own atmosphere. From jungles to swamp base. From giant wonderland to stereotype chinese streets. From epic fantasy world to generic lava-world of Kleers genericness. YESSSSSS.\n\nEven more, music is the best in SS games. It has catchy melodies while making sure that it fits into the current level, having it's own instrument style and personality. Not some lazy generic rock or anything. Sometimes has epic pieces too.\n\nNot to mentioning that since it's not expansion pack of SS1, it means that it brings it's own balance with different enemies, so it's worth playing for SS people. And no, it's still not heavily hitscan abusing thing.\nAnd there are some good weapons too. Double shotgun rocks. It's red. And it's actually good at mid-range too, which makes a lot of sense in horde-based FPS like Serious Sam. And there is explosive homing parrot, so screw you.\n\nPlus it has grenades that you can use anytime without having to stop shooting. And you can drive occasional vehicles of serious firepower. And turrets. But they are still fun, albeit don't manage to change gameplay much. But hey, occasional variety. And hey, 7 bosses in a game!\nOh, and they also spread the levels with random destructable objects. At least this is good, seeing how gore is dissatisfacting there.\n\nIt also kept lives system for some reason, which feels strange in PC game with quicksaving. To be honest, I don't mind, lately I been prefering checkpoints, got tired of quickscumming, so it's nice to have both. But yea, reloading a checkpoint will reset some equipment to whatever was intented, may not keep any weapons you got from early secret.\n\nCombat encounters also felt nice. Not too huge like in the first game, I enjoyed playing the game in last walkthrough. They don't overwhelm you too much. Sadly, there are dragged encounters, where the weak enemies keep spawning for a long time while you easily deal with them.\n\nThere is also multiplayer. Cooperative is just a spamfest that doesn't have any cutscenes from campaign, while you are constantly horrified by how awful player animations are. Never got to try deathmatch, but with netcode as horrible as this maybe it's for the better.\n\nSerious Sam 2 has a weak cartoonish feeling to it, but otherwise it's a fun varied Serious Sam chapter which doesn't take itself seriously. Aside from Sam Stone who is being very very serious about this. He thinks.\nCan be pretty funny too, sometimes.","April 3","true","24.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

Many years ago. At the time I didn't like it, it hadn't the feel of the first two "Encounters" but now, after years I can say that... Nothing changed. I just don't like it...\n\nSerious Sam 2 is an FPS, the simple kind of FPS where you face waves and hordes of enemies before you move to the next area. This is a classic feature of this franchise, together with the humour given by silly situations, small oddities hidden in levels and the dumb comments from the protagonist, Sam "Serious" Stone. This formula is a classic, already seen in games like Duke Nukem and (in minor way) Shadow warrior, So the first two encounters were praised for its old school mind-free structure and the humour inspired by the above-mentioned classics. So there is much to be expected from a 2nd chapter like this, and actually it IS based on the structure of the first 2 encounters, so we have again hordes of silly enemies, humour and an enormous arsenal with an enormous amount of ammo to unleash on the waves of enemies.\nThen why I didn't like it... Again? Honestly, I don't know what to say, I see many people around liking it, but I just can't. Somehow it's the feeling like this isn't serious sam anymore, or maybe it's too much serious sam. Walking around levels I can recognize another classic feature of Croteam's work, so ambience are well done, and you can run into nice landscapes and so on. But some levels are simply odd. They're trying to be some kind of "funny odd", I dont' know. Not to mention the "story" with those 3 "sirians" calling you for help against mental's forces. At the beginning and end of every level there's a cutscene with them or with Sam in the current level and yes, sometimes they're funny, but they often are trying Too much. Same with enemies, trying too much with too many differnet kind of overly-spoofed enemies. And I acknowledge that we're visiting other planets, so obviously there MUST be a variety of "species", but... I don't know they're quite cartoonish... But considering it's serious sam and the design of the prevous encounters I should say they're TOO cartoonish.\nI must say one thing about weapons. Beside the fact that I forgot to mention the presence of turrets and other weaponized vehicles (which in my opinion are both a useful introduction) I have to say something about shotguns. Am I the only one to find those weapons (single and double) to behave quite awkward? They're supposed to have a wider impact on longer distances, so I always try to shoot more enemies at once with shotguns. Hell, I'm expecting to kill more at once with them (like I usually do in other games), yet they almost work like a gun... Totally disappointing, considering it's one of the weapons I use the most...\nMusic is nice, But it doesn't kick ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• like the first encounters (in fact one of the boss tracks is from the second encounter...).\nAnd everything I said, all the problems or differences mentioned are completely gone in Serious Sam 3:\n- Old enemies back? Check\n- Old weapons back? Check\n- Levels with a great level design, and no pastel colours or other dumb stuff? Check\n- REALLY Epic music And BADASS HEAVY Boss Music? Check\n- More Balanced Humour? Well, almost check, SS3 is quite more serious (with sarcasm and humour, but... Whatever, this is a SS2 review...)\nSo this makes me think that also the developers quite agree with the points I've mentioned. And if they did it's because the community reacted on those matters. Then why does Steam lists many good reviews? I have no idea, only GabeN could shine us with his knowledge, but I can guess that's because SS2 it's not a bad game Per se but it's just a Game trying too much to be a Serious Sam Game (I said too many times Game, I know, but I wanted to make a point...), and this is my reason I can't recommend this game.\n\n+++PROs+++ GAMEPLAY. Serious sam definitely revived the FPS genre without creating anything new. Hordes of enemies to get rid of with an entire arsenal (Including the classic HUGE cannon) and weaponized vehicles. That's just fun!\nLEVEL DESIGN. Croteam keeps on doing nice ambience and landscapes to stare at. Unfortunately not for long as waves of enemies will soon come needing your attention.---CONs---TRYING TOO MUCH. This chapter is trying too much, and I could list more PROs, such as music or humour but unfortunately almost everything is exceeding trying to top the level of the first encounters.","March 23","false","11.6"," 13 of 23 people (57%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","57","13","23","3","0"

I've played all Serious Sam games and this one is by far my favorite one of them all. lf you've played a Serious Sam game before, you know the drill. Fight hordes upon hordes of various kinds of enemies with loads of guns without ever reloading in a desert or temple, right? Well this game takes it further.\n\nIt's not just sand and temples. You go on an adventure through five different planets, all with their unique theme(Forest, Swamp, Chinatown, Hell, and Fairy tale planet). And each planet has its own tribe and set of enemies. There's a much bigger enemy variety here than in other Serious Sams, and also just re-skins of enemies.\n\nIt also brings some new weapons, like the dual uzis and a parrot. A ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing parrot. You can kill Satan with that parrot. (I call the red bull soldiers Satan cause they literally look just like him).\n\nThere's also many new enemy types. There's orc soldiers, football players, orc warriors, warriors with huge axes, zombie stockbrokers, zombie minigun nazis, zombie kung fu ninjas, flying kung fu wizards, wicthes, kamikaze clowns etc... There's also a cyborg T-Rex with rocket launchers, a moustche and a cigar. Seriously. [serioussam.wikia.com]\n\nOne of the things that really love about this game is how it's just taking the ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• the entire time. It doesn't itself very seriously. The intro cutscene will immediately let you know. There's a part where Sam enters a phone booth to call Bosses R Us to order an end of level boss; in the first planet the tribe shaman summons ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing King Kong using a DJ mixing table and then you roast him and have a buffet after defeating him; one of the bosses - Cecil the Dragon - begs you to take the King's princess - the king being Elvis Presely, of course- after he kidnaps her cause she's ugly as ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•, but after seeing her Sam doesn't even wanna rescue her and they have a battle to decide who has to stay with the princess, and the dragon tries to kill himself after losing... xD\n\nIt's just really funny and has some clever puns, like how after killing a giant bee Sam says "There be will no bugs in this game!". It's also very forth-wall breaking as even Sam mentions Croteam himself.\n\n\n\nOverall, this isn't a serious game at all. But that's what makes it seriously fun!\n\n10/10","June 1","true","18.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","2"

While I successfully completed the game, I feel as though a part of me is now missing.\n\nThis game is soul crushingly boring and tedious, and while that is part of the Serious Sam style of game play, it entirely misses the point of what made the first two games fun.\n\nThis game makes you feel small, slow, and generally not very powerful. The enemies soak up huge amounts of damage even on lower difficulty levels and while the previous game had specific weapons to use against specific enemies, this one has several enemies that seem to have no weaknesses, and they enjoy throwing them at you in huge quantities(Footballers)\n\nWhile there are sometimes big open areas and arenas in this game, you are often specifically confined to much smaller arenas than the previous game, and the designers just toss enemies one by one at you for 5-10 minutes. The developers even seem to realize that this is annoying because there are several voice callouts that Sam makes that emphasis that they are just tossing fodder at you in a padded fashion.\n\nThe game is split up into 7 distinct sections, the worst of them being the TV challenge series section and the ice world levels, where they introduce a resource mechanic where Sam will freeze to death, yes, Serious Sam will freeze to death, the man who can walk in lava. There are long auto scroller sections often with downtime or enemies on all sides, while confining you to extremely small areas and giving you very little in the way of dodging room. At one point there is a sewer level and the developers thought they were clever by saying all games had sewer levels and making it a maze, but it only calls out how much everyone hates these levels and it drags on far too long to be humorous.\n\nWhile the developers added many new enemies to this game, they all behave as re-skins of existing enemies and don't add to the variety in play styles. Many of the enemies that people lamented from the previous games are back and more annoying than ever, almost as though they thought it would be a good idea to harass players of the existing games for having the audacity to question their design decisions. The flying enemies move around waaaay too much and too fast, and while you can usually lead them around, they tend to cluster directly above you where you can't easily aim, or stay way off in the distance where very few of the weapons they give you are effective.\n\nThey added turrets and vehicles to the game this time around, and it was a huge mistake. While the turrets are typically optional to use, the quantity and rate at which they throw enemies at you implies that they expect you to use them. Anchoring the player down is in stark contrast to the run around at the speed of light I loved in the previous game. The vehicles are typically overpowered and you just hold down mouse one and abuse the infinite ammo until it forces you to get back out of the vehicle. On rare occasions you get out to pull out the minigun and shoot down the flying enemies that you can't hit with the vehicle weapons.\n\nThe audio comes off as polished, but wears thin quickly. With as much as you hear the weapons sounds and musical tracks that don't fit with what you're doing, you grow tired of them, and I eventually turned off the music and turned down the sound effects to listen to something that wasn't going to put me into a coma.\n\nThe game while generally technically competent and feels polished, has a glaring technical flaw. For a game where almost every enemy runs straight at the player, the pathfinding in this game is horrendously broken if there are any obstacles. The enemies often spread out and run in the opposite direction of you, don't notice you at all, or get stuck behind objects that really should have been accounted for in the levels. This leads to parts of the game where you hunt around for several minutes trying to find the last few enemies that have become stuck in the level before the game lets you continue on. (You must kill all enemies to continue through the level.)\n\nThe pacing of the game is rather poor, and it takes away your weapons at the start of each of the 7 distinct sections and makes you run around collecting them, creating a saw wave difficulty curve, and ends up simply annoying more than interesting. They knew they didn't have enough content to make the game the 8.5 hours that it enforces on you, and it shows everywhere, leading to long drawn out sections that are neither harder, nor easier than the previous, just more of the same. If you finished the first three sections of the game, you've seen the rest. It's just another set piece behind the same tedious actions.\n\nThe boss design is typical Serious Sam, where you don't shoot the boss yourself, but play some gimmick that hurts the boss. Most bosses are invincible to player weapons(not technically but you could shoot them for an hours, run out of ammo and still not kill them), and they don't feel particularly rewarding to defeat. The first boss is possibly the most insulting boss I've ever seen in a game. If you take no action, the boss dies within 1-2 minutes, with no involvement. It's a "protect the AI while the AI kills the boss" battle, and I'm astonished they even put it in the game.\n\nI'm giving the last level a special section because of how much I hated it. The last level is a one hour slog through 1200+ enemies while the game showers you in armor and health, and then throws an extremely tedious boss fight at you that will make you question your life, unless you exploit the terrible pathfinding on the AI fighters and hold down the fire button on the vehicle until the boss dies. In comparison with the typical level, it has nothing to offer that is new, just more of the same that you'd grown tired several sections back, and is more than 6 times as long as the typical level.\n\nI cannot reccomend this game in any fashion. If you liked Serious Sam, pick up one of the others in the series, and avoid this one like the plague.","February 8, 2015","false","9.7"," 57 of 110 people (52%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","52","57","110","13","0"

At the start the game seemed a lot boring, but as it progressed the gameplay became better and better. Especially after the Kleer planet. To be honest the best part of this game is the cutscenes which are very funny.\nHowever the overall gameplay is lucklaster and needed more. For example the Kleers (which in the other SS games are the bane of my existence) were so damn easy I was destroying them without looking at the screen. Easy as hell, even on serious difficulty. Nonetheless if you are a Serious Sam fan you might appreciate other parts of the game.\n\nPros:\n\n- Funny Cutscenes\n- Funny Secrets\n- Game play gets better as the game progresses (entairtaining boss battles etc)\n\nCons:\n\n- Very easy to beat\n- Boring in many parts that you actually think of uninstalling it\n- Sounds is meh\n- Final boss is boring as hell :(\n\nI would recommend this game ONLY to the Hardcore SS fans that want to play them all, and even at them take my review with a grain of salt, since a lot of hardcore fans already are bashing it to pulp.\n\n5/10","May 28, 2015","true","15.0"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","4","6","0","0"

I kinda understand why they took a different approach for two from 1. They wanted to make a different sequal with addid humor, an actual story, and a bunch of cutscenes. I will admit that this game was not nearly as serious as the other two games but it was very fun. I would have written a more positive review, but sadly the ending ruined it for me. First there was the fact that the final boss wasn't mental, and instead was a floating building thats impossable to kill without keeping the serious damage bonus from the fight before it. Secondly was the fact that this game didn't end the franchise and the franchise is basically dead in the water as serious sam 3 is actually a prequal to the first game. So I'd say the game was fun but the ending was probably one of thee worst endings of a video game franchise. Still, I'm glad I played it, I guess, I just wish it could have ended better. Oh well, the Sam franchise is over now, and they are making other games. Still, definetly buy the serious sam pack when on sale and you'll just wiggle through this game while your at it like I did.","December 14, 2014","true","17.7"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

It is a long game with many different levels and environments.\n\nPros:\n- nice graphics\n- weapons look better than in First & Second encounters - especially plasma rifle is really pretty and useful and the cannon looks badass\n- some new enemies do look good - zombie lawyers, flying kleers, kung fu masters\n- this game is long, although levels take about 10-15 minutes to finish, sometimes even less\n- many varied levels\n- the game is challenging at some stages\n\nCons:\n- this game is long - sometimes there are tedious things to do before advancing to the next level like killing every single enemy\n- this is not like previous Serious Sam, this is a totally different game!\n- where are old enemies like Gnaars, beheaded troopers, biomechanoids (sorry, T-rex mech smoking pipe is just weird). Instead we have stupidly looking clowns that are basically faster kamikaze trooper, some space orks with guns(?), witches flying on brooms (?) and some white apes shooting energy balls (duh)\n- some weapons are really weak in comparison to their function - like rocket launcher has really small damage, dual uzis are good only for weak enemies, grenade launcher is made available only later in the game, dual barrel shotgun is weak\n- the plot is stupid and pointless\n- there are not as many secrets as in First & Second encounters\n- there are no messages and encyclopaedia as in previous games where you could read funny stuff about enemies, items, levels and so on\n\nSo, vanilla Serious Sam 2 is a really disappointing game to me. I've expected something like Serious Sam Third Encounter but instead got something like Serious Sam the Spin-off. I would certainly not recommend this game...\n\nUntill I've played this Insamnity mod that is already built into the steam game. While playing the first level I saw beheaded troopers. Wow. Later I saw Gnaars. A big plus. The author of the mod probably deleted all of the clowns, because I don't remember seeing one. The game was running better and faster after running the Insamnity mod. There are even more enemies and this is finally providing a challenge worthy of Serious Sam name.\n\nReally, if not for the mod I would not recommend this game. This one mod saves the whole game and now it finally feels like home. Like a Serious Sam game should feel.\n\n----------\nFor anyone interested in joining in on completing your own backlog; check it out here - http://steamcommunity.com/groups/completingthebacklog/discussions/5/530645446320364338/","January 10","true","24.4"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","4"

I wonder whether it is because some of the players only have some 2 hours on record and can't possibly have got very far yet during that time. I won't speculate.\n\nLet's start at the beginning. Initially, I also liked the game. It was a trip down memory lane of games where noone worried about chest-high walls, weapon carrying capacity or why a spinning cross magically restored your health. In short: good old times that could do without realism. Like the original Doom or Duke Nukem 3D. This is also how the game is controlled: directions, jump, use, trigger ... crouch if you feel like it - but you'll hardly ever need it. The weapons are the usual suspects (pistol, shotgun, machinegun, rocket launcher, sniper rifle, sci-fi laser-plasma watsit) and a bomb-carrying parrot(!). The enemies seem to be a who's who from all previous FPS titles, which didn't bother me so much. The levels are large with lots of stuff to collect or blow up. Secrets not only offer power-ups but also some amusing Easter-eggs, like two native aliens doing it in the woods in the first level.\nI only started getting concerned when levels more and more became chains of isolated areas in which you are then rushed by waves of enemies until you or they all die. Having now reached the last-but-one chapter I can't say it's got better.\n\nPoints of criticism - in no particular order:\n- Lives versus save-games. This game has both. You can save and load at any time. If you die you respawn at the beginning of the current area and the whole area with its power-ups and enemies and general progress is reset. You also loose all Serious Bombs, half ammo on the good weapons, most (or all?) armour and all health above 100. So in the many cases you'll be worse off than when you entered the area in the first place. Why would I ever want to use this feature in favour of saves?\n- The point system. You receive points for killing enemies and finding treasure. During a level this may grant you extra lives (which are pointless, as discussed above). At the end of the level you receive various bonuses for finishing within a certain time, finding secrets or kill count. Then you are presented with a meaningless total score that will never matter because it'll never be heard of again and there is no high-score feature of any kind.\n- Story? I'm sure there is one. I didn't find it very engaging. There were a few exchanges I found vaguely funny but most of it felt more like filler material that tied together places where I could shoot at random things.\n- Racism ... I'm trying not be the one to cry wolf but is there nobody else who found the designs for some of the alien races a bit racist - especially the Chinese-style world. I'm not sure here whether this was supposed to be tongue-in-cheek humour or actually poking fun at racial stereotypes. It does seem to be walking the narrow ledge between funny and offensive. Then again, so was Duke Nukem.\n- Punishment for good behaviour. Classic: A power-up that turns out to be a trap. A juicy 25-health bonus that also causes a rocket launcher demon to spawn right behind you and take off 40-50 health in one shot unless you kill it quickly enough. The first few times you still think: "oh, you crafty son of a gun!" But if this keeps happening, especially in places where you really need that health, this turns more into a weary: "oh, for Pete's sake, not again!"\n- Glitches. Peek around a corner, line up a shot with the rocket launcher, press fire ... and watch yourself blow up because collision detection decided your gun wasn't pointing around the corner just yet. Better yet, a number of levels require you to kill a certain number of enemies before they let you go on (see also "the grind" below) but sometimes the enemies get stuck on their way to work, i.e. from their spawn points into the playing area. While that did make the area easier since there were fewer things shooting at me it also confused the hell out me why I couldn't go on. And then I had to make the rounds of the spawn points and pick each one clean. In one case that took nearly 10 minutes.\n- The grind. This is what I found most annoying. With a few noteworthy exceptions most levels are just chains of rooms or areas which lock you in until you have defeated a number of increasingly difficult waves of enemies. At first this intense action on limited space was fun but after 7 worlds of it this strikes me as lazy level design. Even in old titles like Doom or Duke Nukem you could backtrack, pick up power-ups you left for later, set a trap for enemies that followed you or try a different route to reach enemies that were difficult to hit. Here it often turns into strafing in circles, holding <fire> until everything besides you has stopped moving. I get the message that this is not game for campers but by now I find it's got less "serious" and more "tedious". I was surprised to see I have - at the time of writing - only clocked in 24 hours of game time. It certainly feels a lot longer. The only thing that now makes me come back to it is a mix of stubborn persistence and a hurt sense of pride. Can't. Let. This. ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•. Get. The better. Of me! I'm not sure that's a good thing.\n\nCan I recommend it? I'm tending towards choosing "no". On one side there are obviously huge numbers of players that enjoyed Serious Sam 2 and swear by it. Sure, there's a lot of fun to be had in some levels. I do love going wild and shooting up hordes of virtual enemies.\nOn the other hand it also has a lot going against it, the worst of which is repetitiveness. 24 hours of game time is not a lot but towards the end I would actually quit because I couldn't make myself repeat the same room for the n-th time after being killed by the last enemy to spawn in, or go through yet another room of another n waves of yet the same enemies. Or maybe I'm just not "serious" enough. Take your pick.","December 15, 2014","false","25.0"," 36 of 69 people (52%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","52","36","69","0","0"

That about tells you all you need to know.\n\nSerious Sam wasn't ever serious, but this one is absolutely stuffed to the gills with zany. There's a lot of awkward, miss-the-mark humour in it. The old bestiary have been remade as silly cartoons, although bizzarely some of the new additions are unimaginative humanoids, and some of them commit the sin of having hitscan weapons, making them priority targets despite being lowly minions.\n\nYou still mow things down with a minigun, then do it some more, then finally maybe it'll let your index finger uncurl for some dancing-with-kleer and a double shotgun. Except both at the same time. While popping off some rockets at a giant spider in the distance, and sniping a helicopter sweeping across the fray. The offhand grenades are an excellent addition for adding a little extra firepower and rewarding you for herding enemies into clumps.\n\nYou still can't rocket-jump without taking your legs off below the knee, but you can still run at 30MPH on your last hitpoint, desperately dancing and weaving through laser blasts toward a health pickup. Cover is something you blow up to deny it to the enemy. It's still Serious Sam, and it's not got the vast expanses of the first, but it's still big. And twice as long as you might think at first. A lot of stuff happens, and it's not lacking in variety of scenery and experience. Even the turret and vehicle sections are welcome shake-ups to what otherwise might be twenty hours of the minigun spinning.\n\nAnd it's nice to have Sam moving *towards* MENTAL for once, not sideways, or backwards into prequels. For all its screwed-up tone, and some lousy and unfun early-level design (what were they THINKING with the single shotgun?), by the finale it's one adrenaline build-up after another.","December 26, 2013","true","20.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

They simply tried too hard to make it silly, and as a result much of the humor just comes across as stupid. The cartoony art style just doesn't work all that well for it, but the visuals are still surprisingly impressive, and it's exceptionally nice to have an FPS with tons of color in it. The gameplay is still definitely full of Serious Sam's huge environments and fast-paced arcadey FPS style, and that's what makes it worth playing. Diehard fans of Serious Sam should probably avoid it though.","April 7, 2012","true","3.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Even though I liked the 2nd Encounter,  Serious Sam 2 just didn't appeal to me All the game is, is shoot stuff get a cutscene, get to another planet with friendly aliens which  differ slightly, maybe by colour  but all sound the same as the aliens that were on the other planet and are all small and bipedal. Fight some boss, get medallion repeat until you get all 6 pieces. It's very repetitive and feels mindless  and pointless. With jokes and humour that falls flat and only those 10 and under would be amused by.\n\nThis is like the kids version of Serious Sam with cartoony over bright graphics and enemies such as clowns and witches that look like they came straight from a cartoon and clowns have the exact same cackle as the witches and instead of the major mechanoids there are now T-Mechs which have dinosaur heads and tails and Rhino Cybertoys which look like giant wind up toy rhinos instead of Sirian werebulls which just shows new enemies are made with a kiddie like theme. And while I don't mind, kiddie or cartoony type games, I feel it does not suit this game and prefer the darker, grittier feel of The Serious Sam Encounters.\n\nDon't recommend, this is the worst Serious Sam.

The main objective of this game is to bring down Mental and his vile armies. For that, the player has to battle through thick jungles, murky swamps, frozen tundra, and futuristic cities.  The player is able to obtain better gear and epic vehicles as time progresses.  Tired of campaign? No worries, Serious Sam 2 offers co-op and deathmatch chaos. Besides that, its soothing soundtrack and scenic levels motives the player to carry on their endeavour.\n\nPros\n+ Easy to control and navigate the character.\n+ Cartoony graphics.\n+ Beautiful maps and environment.\n+ Unique maps and levels, battle accross more than 40 levels!\n+ Contains different "species" of enemies including bosses.\n+ An array of weapons, vehicles and turrets that keeps you wanting for more.\n\nCons\n- Players start each level with 100 health regardless of whether the player had more or less at the end.\n- Have a life system which some might find annoying.\n- Players loose Serious Bombs between levels.\n\nFinal Rating: 9/10","February 12","true","0.6"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","1"

Even though I liked the 2nd Encounter,  Serious Sam 2 just didn't appeal to me All the game is, is shoot stuff get a cutscene, get to another planet with friendly aliens which  differ slightly, maybe by colour  but all sound the same as the aliens that were on the other planet and are all small and bipedal. Fight some boss, get medallion repeat until you get all 6 pieces. It's very repetitive and feels mindless  and pointless. With jokes and humour that falls flat and only those 10 and under would be amused by.\n\nThis is like the kids version of Serious Sam with cartoony over bright graphics and enemies such as clowns and witches that look like they came straight from a cartoon and clowns have the exact same cackle as the witches and instead of the major mechanoids there are now T-Mechs which have dinosaur heads and tails and Rhino Cybertoys which look like giant wind up toy rhinos instead of Sirian werebulls which just shows new enemies are made with a kiddie like theme. And while I don't mind, kiddie or cartoony type games, I feel it does not suit this game and prefer the darker, grittier feel of The Serious Sam Encounters.\n\nDon't recommend, this is the worst Serious Sam. I'd rate it 5/10 a rather average game bordering on bad.\n","June 15, 2015","false","14.9"," 8 of 16 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","8","16","0","0"

Serious Sam has never been a serious series, but this game tries way way way too hard to be funny. It's not even good humor, it's like having a friend tell you a series of jokes that you already heard before. And they're everywhere. From the "oh so wacky" designs of both npcs and enemies, to the awful attempts at situation comedy both in and out of cutscenes, the game just bludgeons the player over the head with jokes that would be better suited for comedy night at an elementary school.\n\nUnlike other Serious Sam games, this game also frequently interrupts gameplay with cutscenes and story segments. These segments made me feel as though I had been kidnapped and taken away from the only remotely enjoyable part of the game, the gameplay, briefly tortured, released back to what I was doing, only to be kidnapped again a few minutes later.\n\nThe gameplay is similar to the other entries in this series, though easier. If you are looking for a fast-paced shooter with lots of guns and a ton of diverse enemies that you blast away with your immense firepower in different types of arenas... well this game does that. But every other game in this series does it too and without the unbearable aspects of this one. Don't touch this one.","January 12, 2014","false","12.0"," 13 of 28 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","13","28","0","9"

This game runs at 200 fps on maximum settings on a computer that was mid-range in 2007 and looks incredibly pleasant.\nThe Bad:All of the jokes and dialogue feels taken out of a bad kids' cartoon. Even the youngest audience would groan and cringe ant the horrible plot, cutscenes and Sam's one liners. The other Serious Sam games were much more tactful in their approach to humor.\nInvisible walls everywhere, discouraging exploration. Feels like a corridor shooter.\nThe gunplay fees terrible. There is no knockback, recoil or stagger. For most of the guns, you wouldn't be able to tell they're firing if you muted the sound. his is unforgivable for a game where 99% of the gameplay is shooting.\nBoring secrets containing mostly "treasure" that gives point boosts.\nNon-scaling HUD that looks pixelated on PC resolutions.\nConsolized menus with excessive scrolling and bizarre mouse lag.\nThere are no cutscenes in co-op, so the story makes zero sense with players being warped from place to place. I'm not sure if this is a pro or con, since the cutscenes are universally cringeworthy.\n\nThis is the worst game in the series, and it's metacritic rating is much higher than it deserves. Don't buy it even on sale unless you have a friend to co-op with.","November 16, 2014","false","6.8"," 12 of 26 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","12","26","0","2"

Theres a difference between good quality games with humor, and Serious Sam 2. I am trying my hardest to find a good thing in this game but all the sound is annoying, the non-Sam models are so un-lifelike that it's cringe worthy, and there are so many odd choices I don't get.

First, we had SS1 Xbox which I absolutely despised, then SS Next Encounter which in my humble opinion was an absolute disgrace and finally this, Serious Sam 2, which perhaps is in the middle ground.\n\n\nAlthough the reasons why I dislike this game are many, a few of them are also subjective, so not everyone would concur with my standarts.\n- the cartoony artstyle, the childish tone, the overused humour and the lack of gore made the game less compelling compared to the other Sam games;\n- invisible walls plague the game;\n- severe hand-holding;\n- Painkiller-based arena battles. They're good in their own right, but this is Serious Sam, not Painkiller;\n- cut-down exploration : SS2 likes feeding the player with resources considerably more than the other SS games do;\n- too arcady : not as much as Next Encounter, but it still makes the impression that you're playing just for points. In SS1 the points weren't such a considerable part of the game.\n\nStill, there are good things worth mentioning.\n- the locales are varied and quite interesting, especially when they're in vein of SS1;\n- the soundtrack is rather pleasing as well.\n- good enemy variety;\n- recaptures the very essence of Serious Sam - the 'Dancing with the enemies' type of gameplay.\n\nAll in all, I deem Serious Sam 2 to be the worst Serious Sam game out there, (I'm not talking about the spin-offs), albeit as a game on its own it's probably alright. SS1 and SS3 I find to be much more fun, much more compelling and just better games in general; I recommend those ones.","February 25","false","25.5"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

If you have any common sense you'll skip past this awful game. The graphics are cartoony and unrealistic, your health, armor and ammo are reset EVERY level, the enemies are completely ridiculous and inconsistent, and all the secrets end up getting you killed. Oh, and the difficulty. I had NO trouble beating the First or Second Encounter on Hard, but this game went WAY too far. I found myself dying within the first few levels, mostly because of the moronic way in which they spawn in the enemies. Get ready to fight at least 50 of the same enemy... in all of the "encounters" in every level I've tried. I've only managed to get to the second episode before I couldn't get any farther at all, because the difficulty rises immediatly after the first level ends. They could have attempted to ease you in gradually, but they just decided to turn up the difficulty to max after just the first boss. The only thing I can say I enjoyed about this game was the music. Yep, that's the only redeeming factor to this inexcusible blemish on Croteam's record. Just take the money you would have spent on this vomit and buy the First Encounter or Second Encounter.

Not quite OK.\n\nThis game often has fantastic graphics...except when it has mediocre graphics. The game is often a lot of fun, except when it is boring and repetitive (which is a LOT). In general it is often very hit and miss. Really cool stuff often appears on-screen alongside utter trash designs. The worst part of this game is its utterly insipid "humor" which sinks so low as to depict racist, racial caricatures (but then all the characters (other than you and the enemies you shoot up) are depicted as short and stupid looking but the racist caricatures are definitely there to be seen (in fact they are hard to miss). The plot is insipid, the dialogue is useless and unfunny. The sound is mediocre. Everytime a good piece of music occurs (which is quite rare) it is almost immediately interrupted less than a fourth of the way into it by goofy, highly repetitive action music. The difficulty is uneven as the game does not consistently give you enough health items to get through areas.\n\nThis first-person-perspective action game is okay to play a little at a time but it gets boring really fast. It is repetitive. repetitive. repetitious. That's what struck me most about this game other than the occasionally beautiful graphics; the terribly monotonous repetition. There is a fairly wide variety of bizarre enemies to fight although the weapons are mostly standard (except for a gattling shotgun and a suicidal parrot which homes in on enemies and carries a bomb along with it. The minigun is also pretty excellent looking in this game). The game's colors are extremely bright and colorful and cartoony (perhaps brighter than in a Mario game) but there at the same time dying enemies constantly explode into so much bright red chunks and bloody gore that I often wondered what audience this game was intended for.","November 6, 2015","false","11.5"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","3","9","0","0"

So with all the positive reviews 2 had I figured I couldn't go wrong by buying it. That was a mistake. Serious Sam 2 is a joke compared to the first game, shooting the guns feels hollow and empty, killing the enemies is lackluster and devoid of fun, as well as the level design is nothing like the first game. Trading in ancient Egyptian temples for whatever the hell the designers wanted each level to be. "Oh this can be an island level, this can be a snow level, etc, etc." It's like every bad FPS cliche rolled into one very unfun game. If you want to get an fps game for a 10-11 year old kid this might be great for them, but as a serious gamer I can't recommend it. Some of the other reviewers are saying to stick with it, and that it gets better further in, but frankly I can't bring myself to play it another minute.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/aseliot/recommended/204340/","aseliot","Aseliot","http://steamcommunity.com/id/aseliot/","133 products in account","This a review, also a rant.\n\nThis game gameplay-wise is okay i guess, but it's not good\njust because you used to play this when you were a child. Also\nthis is the only serious sam that deviates way too much from the\noriginal. Here are the reasons why.\n\nFor some reason almost everything from the previous serious sam\nis either replaced or completely removed. This includes both\nenemies and weapons.\n\nThe worst thing about this game is that you could possibly replace\nsam with any other character and call it something else and it then\nwould've probably been called a serious sam ripoff.\n\nAlso much in the style of this game, this review is trying to\nbe funny. So by reading this you will immediately get an accurate\nrepresentation of the humor used in the game.\n\nOnto the enemies\n- No gnaars as enemies, only as a show host. Okay?\n- No reptiloid, demon, arachnoid (replaced), lava golem\n- Beheaded enemies replaced by space orcs but no\ngood replacement for firecrackers. And didn't we already\nhave the ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing Zorg!?\n- Why would you replace the Sirian werebull with\na wind-up toy?\n- Clowns holding cakes that explode into confetti...\n- Also some enemies appear to be pinatas.\n- Enemies explode and bleed but chunks don't stay\nand blood doesn't smear walls and floors :(\n- You know what, let's just add helicopters.\n- ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• it. Also put in some dog fight flyer thing.\n- And super accurate shotgun zombies.\n- Biomeachnoids also need cigars, why didn't we put\nthat in sooner.\n- And i dunno, ehm. A witch? That goes gnignigni and\nfarts glitters and purple gas and explodes into candy\nand rainbows.\n- We should also add a bone snake, and only like 5\nof them will appear in that one level on that one world.\n- Phew all this creativity, just one more enemy left to\nadd. What should we add this time, we already have everything\nwe could ever come to think off. How about we just add a\n‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ING ROLLING BALL and call it a day so i can go home\nand spend some time playing this game with my kids. They\nwould love this!\n\nGameplay\n- You move a lot slower than in ss1\n- Some projectiles cannot be dodged due to your\nslow movement and neither can be shot.\n- No screen with info on the monsters?\n- Netrisca is now a "Hey Listen!" type of\ncompanion.\n- You know why they removed NETRISCA being able to\ngive you info about enemies, cause it's really ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing\nhard to explain clowns on unicycles!\n- I only used the double pistol once or twice.\n- Never used the saw.\n- And what the ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• is that yellow thing that\nshoots other yellow things? Is it a weapon?\n\nSound\n- Is the uzi silenced? No? Heh?\n- Explosions! ... Explosions? What are those?\nNever heard of them, no pun intended.\n- MK4 launcher................\n- Grenades are apparently ordinary fireworks.\n\nI finished the whole game. It was fairly entertaining but I\nnever got that serious sam feeling I got with the other two.\n\nFirst two worlds are mediocre, third/fourth is the best one\n(read mediocre) and then it all goes downhill from there.\n\nAt least they never show mental in this game. But considering\ncroteam is able to make something like this we have to wait and\nsee if SS4 will either be the darkest one yet or that it will\nbe something more eehm... creative.\n\nI just pray we never get to see mental, because at this point\nI think he might end up being some kind of little person with\nan inflated head and the voice of a chipmunk.\n\nThe game also still has a mature rating offcourse. However\nwith this one they might reconsider the ESRB rating and add\nJUVENILE.\n\nI could go on a little bit longer, just like this game did\nin the end. You just want it to end, like the ending to\nlord of the rings. But LOTR was a trilogy movie epic, whereas\nthis game feels like it is Serious Sam as it would be envisioned\nby Disney World exclusively releasing it in "green blood" Germany.","February 1","false","11.9"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","3","0","0"

After about an hour  (maybe less) we decided to go play SS3 instead. Now, I understand this game is dated, however it was a huge turn off when we realized that the game looked a lot different and kiddie than what the series usually was. The story wasn't good, voice acting was bland, vehicles didn't enhance the game at all, and the cartoony art style wasn't attractive at all. Take my word and skip this game.

Humor abounds, though not all of it funny, like Sam's bouts of flatulence.  Controls are simple, consisting mostly of strafing and holding the fire button.\n\nSerious Sam 2 sets the stage for the final confrontation with the main villain, Mental, but the story and ending are very, very disappointing.  One of Serious Sam's namesakes, endless waves of enemies, feel monotonous rather than epic.

There are many points within this game where the levels feel so bland and uninspiring despite the cartoon-y apperance, and most of the levels are so cramped that it makes the previous installments feel ashamed. Speaking of bland, the enemies themselves, despite there being many of them, are just reskins of reskins, with one different stat tweek to make it look like a different enemy.\n\nThis probably wouldn't be such a big deal if they didn't stay on screen for as long as they did. The weapons in this game feel, sound, and just generally weak as hell. The shotguns make me feel like I am shooting bean bags at people, the Uzis sound like aged airsoft guns, and the rocket launcher would have more impact if it was shooting party poppers than its excuse for 'rockets'. Thanks to this, and the games constant decision to take away your ammunition, can make the game hard as balls to points where you just want to give up.\n\nI could go on, but I think I made my point clear without touching the 'story', the horrendous hand holding, and the numerous bugs. Don't buy this game. Don't play it if you've got it from a Bundle either. Buy and play ANY of the other games, and you'll enjoy yourself so much more.","February 23, 2014","false","10.0"," 2 of 10 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","2","10","0","0"

We smashed through the First and Second Encounters, then skipped ahead to SS3 as it was newly released at the time. Turns out we made the right choice by skipping over SS2. Suffice it to say that we never completed this game, so I can't really say if it gets better, but the first few levels were populated with ridiculous cartoon critters that inspired only a bland sense of bemusement in me, rather than any genuine thrill. The levels themselves are a sugar-coated mess of bright colours and kid-friendly stereotypes of various civilisations (that kind of reminded me of Crash Bandicoot), and are difficult to navigate given that they were smaller and less open than the levels in either SS1 or SS3. I remember little about the weapons, which is probably quite telling, other than that I recall feeling frustrated.

Mute or text-only computer is better than talking one for sure.)\nYou don't like stupid childish cartoonish humour and low quality pre-rendered cutscenes.\n\nSo what actually is Serious Sam Series?\nSS is a series of FPS shooters. That's what is called now, a classic fps, when you face hoards of enemies with a bunch of guns and oceans of lead and explosives. Levels are mostly linear, sometimes branching and returning where you started. There is a nice list of monster types, but there will be thousands of them. Plot is somewhere near, there's not much of it usually.\n\nWhat is Serious Sam 2 and why is it bad?\nSerious Sam 2 is a sequel to Second Encounter. It's made on new-er version of Serious Engine 2 featuring slightly better graphics and different physics. However in my opinion, this is the most unsuccessful Serious Sam game. Visual design was chosen strangely, always serious and brutal game became ridiculous. Maps are smaller than SS1, loadings are more frequent. I don't know why, but I've played this game before I met Steam and I enjoyed it. When I tried it now, It was frustratingly dumb, I just immediately turned off Netrisca's voice when she said something stupid, like "go forward, over there" and Sam answered "Yes sir, I mean maam." I played through 5 first maps, and I just couldn't enjoy the game anymore. Often game stops you in a square room and forces you to fight off N enemies, only then letting you to proceed, what really slows it down. The last levels of the game (planet Sirius) are the best ones, the most dynamic and fun.\n\nSo what am I trying to say. While trying to make a new, beautiful game with plot and humour, Croteam for the first time failed, making some dumb cartoon instead. The only thing that was done right is the core of the game. The hoards of enemies and guns. In case you haven't played Serious Sam 3 BFE yet, better skip this one and play BFE instead, it's more "Serious Sam" than this game has ever been.","May 16","false","1.2"," 0 of 7 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","7","0","1"

The gameplay and your opponents are a kitchen sink of first-person shooters, with characters from everything from /Doom/ to /Halo/ (just the Covenant), as well as the occasional Conan the Barbarian reference; the settings of the game are various cliche game settings, from the /Far Cry/ planet to the /Doom/ planet to the /Big Trouble in Little China/ and /World of Warcraft/ planets. The effect is not to be missed; there's something unique, beautiful, even haunting about driving a light tank and fighting helicopters in front of the gates of a fairy-tale castle.\n\nWhy do these planets retain their distinctive character, despite Mental's occupation? _How_ do they do so, given that Mental's homeworld is gleaming and hyper-modern, and surely produces the sort of abundant, cheap consumer goods that have caused the Middle East and East Asia to lose their distinctive visual character? Perhaps Mental doesn't permit free trade between his own planet and his colonies, but this seems unlikely; more likely, perhaps his homeworld is a command economy (Mental is an AI, after all), and just doesn't produce enough of a surplus of anything -- or have enough interest in peaceful trade -- to provide blue jeans and televisions cheap enough for the people of the Far Cry world to afford...\n\nMental's manpower also doesn't appear to be as good as it could be; he's dependent on local levies to keep order, and his regular troops -- Warhammer-style orcs supported by heavy military hardware -- seldom show up in large numbers outside of small numbers of major bases and garrisons. This despite the orcs having access to antibiotics and vaccination, Green Revolution agriculture, computerized manufacturing, and all sorts of other things that should be keeping their numbers up relative to their enemies... but command economies aren't really known for high population growth.\n\nIt's an interesting puzzle; it certainly produces a memorably combined visual character; and it does seem to have an answer in the end. I doubt that the writers knew that Serious Sam is fighting the AI Soviet Union, but the internal evidence does point that way...\n\nI wonder what inspired this company to write this game. They certainly make some amusing points about how there's a shared culture of video games that shouldn't exist, looking at the matter a priori -- there's no reason why everyone should use the same types of characters and settings. But they satirize it with a great deal of flair, and in a way that turns out to have a surprisingly hefty inner logic.","November 8, 2014","true","3.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Serious Sam 2 preserves the frantic, enemies-everywhere, off-the-rails action that makes the series what it is, while adding new things. Admittedly, the story is crap and just serves to shuffle you from one area to the next, but the game itself is solid. The levels have a real sense of scale to them, and the game manages to throw ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• at you from all angles without you ever feeling overwhelmed; you're in control just enough to keep from losing it entirely.\n\nThe enemies you fight range from your old classics like suicide bombers and those horse-skeleton things, but you've also got entirely new enemies such as rocket-launching dinosaurs, sawblade ninjas, and spiky purple balls. There's a nice mix of old and new, and the enemies are unique enough to make you change up your tactics. Near the end of the story campaign the action wears a little thin as the game runs out of cool things to let you shoot, but the ride as a whole is solid. The addition of mounted turrets and vehicles complements the massive level sizes and makes for some fun setpieces as well. The visuals are clearly aged, but the widescreen support is good and you can tell what you're looking at.\n\nIn all, Serious Sam 2 is a brilliant step up for the series, preserving the core gameplay while keeping things fun and inventive. It's a balanced mix of old and new that is sure to delight fans and newcomers alike.","October 12, 2014","true","20.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Overall a very goofy and casual Doom-style FPS. 6/10","July 23, 2013","true","13.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Only becouse of wave duration game becomes not only anoying but also way harder then actualy it is you wont run out of bullets but instead out of HP and ofc die.  AI knows to simply get stuck in wall, rock or any other object and just stare at target being another NPC or yourself.\nIf you get frustrated easy dont buy it.Get it only if you like to kill endless waves of mobs for me it gets dull realy fast first SS game is better in my opinion","January 4, 2015","false","1.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A masterpiece, I have played this game for about a femtosecond and I'm already blown away by this games surprising visuals and 10/10 gameplay. Like old Serious Sam game, you play as Sam the man himself and his quest to kill Mental in an all out war. Set after the events of Serious Sam Second Encounter, Sam must fight through waves of enemies, including the return of Kamikaze and Kleer. Many of Serious Sam's amazing one liners have returned, including "It's time to kick ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• and chew bubble gum, and I'm all out of gum" and "You wanna dance?", Sam has it all in this action packed sequal to the previously lacking series about Sam and his quest to kill Mental.

I'll probably continue to play this in very small doses, cuz to be honest, there is way too much action going on for me.\nI do recommend it though for anyone who just wants to go loco with some weapons. It has some cool elements to it, like being able to ride a fire-shooting raptor or operating canons against major air attacks. It's not a very serious game as the name might imply, it has a lot of humour to it.

With a huge array of weapons, vehicular combat, and secrets galore, you'll never find yourself short on ways to splatter your enemies.

Ive got all the main games in the serious sam series since i got serious sam 1 and 2 encounet for xbox. I have the serious sam double d and the best ps2 game, serious sam the next encounet. AND DONT FORGET THE LEGENDERY SAM 3. So i reacently got steam, played f2p games for a few months. Today, the day this has been typed ITS MY BIRTHDAY XD, so i got goat simulator, and this godly game.

The enviroment is cool and I wish there was more time to explore it, but with trillions of enemies constantly charging at you, you find no time to relax. I'll probably continue to play this in very small doses, cuz to be honest, there is way too much action going on for me.\nI do recommend it though for anyone who just wants to go loco with some weapons. It has some cool elements to it, like being able to ride a fire-shooting raptor or operating canons against major air attacks. It's not a very serious game as the name might imply, it has a lot of humour to it. For example I found two little blue Simbas making love in some bushes, triggering some type of achivement.","May 5, 2014","true","5.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

An absolute pleasure to play and very entertaining for an FPS, and the whole game seems massive and to last forever.  I love the humour in this, awesome, just awesome. Serious Sam 2 is my favorite FPS of all time, and as old as this game now is, because of the cartoon like feel, I can still play today and it doesn't feel aged to me.

The graphics and design choices for the characters are nothing like Serious Sam TFE and TSE or 3. The color palette is beautiful and the artwork is cartoony, which makes the game feel out of place in the series. But the shooting does not live up to TFE or TSE, both the battles and the feel of the weapons are sub par to TFE and TSE (NOT BAD by any means, but sub par). The game is relatively long (which is good) and has some unnecessary difficulty spikes (which is bad) like the final boss fight! Also the developer is still supporting the game (which is really good!). Overall you should really play TFE, TSE, and Serious Sam 3 before this game, and only if you enjoyed them. 7/10 would play conditionally.","August 10, 2015","true","13.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Guns are more or less the same from SS1, the levels are just as huge and sprawling, but nowhere near the intensity of the waves of SS1. Bosses are pretty good overall. Losing all your weapons between worlds and some hitscan enemies aren't the greatest. Lives system doesn't really work that well. Otherwise, game is still a lot of fun, just not as good as Serious Sam 1. 8/10.\n\nStory: Actual cutscenes this time around, usually a good laugh and generally worth watching. Never becomes anything close to dramatic, which is perfectly fine. 7/10.\n\nGraphics: A timeless art style, very cartoonish, bright and colorful. New monster designs are great. The graphics options for this game are enough to make your head spin. Hippie blood is the greatest thing ever. 5/5.\n\nSound: OST not as good as SS1, but still pretty good overall.

However there are 52 levels in Serious Sam 2 which, combined with the enemy and stage variety, keep the pace going.\n\n+/- Some weapons have been nerfed (Rocket Launcher/ Dual Uzis which replace the Tommy Gun ) while others have been buffed ( single and double barrelled shotgun).\n\n- Sound effects for some weapons sound weak (Dual Uzis, Single-barrelled shotgun, Rocket Launcher).\n\nOverall I give this game a 9/10.\n\n\n\nP.S.: Play this game on Serious Difficulty for the ultimate Serious Sam experience.","July 22, 2015","true","16.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The graphics and design choices for the characters are nothing like Serious Sam TFE and TSE or 3. The color palette is beautiful and the artwork is cartoony, which makes the game feel out of place in the series. But the shooting does not live up to TFE or TSE, both the battles and the feel of the weapons are sub par to TFE and TSE (NOT BAD by any means, but sub par). The game is relatively long (which is good) and has some unnecessary difficulty spikes (which is bad) like the final boss fight! Also the developer is still supporting the game (which is really good!). Overall you should really play TFE, TSE, and Serious Sam 3 before this game, and only if you enjoyed them. 7/10 would play conditionally.","August 10, 2015","true","13.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The two titles share the same gameplay and shoot 'em up genre, and a new style shouldn't drive away a true Serious Sam fan. The humor, albeit horrendous, shouldn't cause you to drop the game either.\nThis game is perfect for its supposed to be.","July 29, 2015","true","7.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But it is SERIOUS SAM nonetheless. A Fun ride with sam across multiple planets.\n\nNot as engaging as 1 or 3 but definitely a must play. And a must buy to all Sam fans.\n\n8/10 - A mockery of a decent game but still better than most shooters out there.","January 27","true","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
