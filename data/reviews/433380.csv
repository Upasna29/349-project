"http://steamcommunity.com/id/abbugabbu/recommended/433380/","abbugabbu","Abby","http://steamcommunity.com/id/abbugabbu/","233 products in account","I'll preface this review by saying that I love survival horror games. I've spent several thousands of hours playing and watching many games of the genre, including the Silent Hill, Resident Evil, Alone in the Dark and Fatal Frame series, so it goes without saying I have no problem with dated controls or graphics.\n\nI was really excited for Back in 1995, and I wanted to like it. I was practically waiting down to the hour for it to be out on Steam. I already knew it was going to be a short game, as stated in the info on steam: "Approximate playtime is 2-3 hours".\n\nFirst to put things straight, that approximation is VERY off. I completely finished everything the game had to offer in about 1.25 hours, this is INCLUDING a section that had no gameplay and was just a set of text commentary. I already expected the game to be short and wouldn't have had a problem with it were it not for my second problem with the game:\n\nSubstance. The game lacks any real substance in terms of plot, story devices or a conclusion. Most of the game is spent plodding along following instructions and tidbits of newspaper clippings and notes which establish a hint at some sort of extra layer to the story that is never quite fulfilled. The living characters are basically props, they offer nothing to the story and have no characterisation or personality. Even the unvoiced protagonist has barely anything to offer. It's a shame because after the false ending the game looked like it was going to take a turn for the interesting, before being cut short and ending the game (which by the way, is basically just developer commentary which while cool doesn't really make up for the lack of conclusion). This game really excels at getting your hopes up for some excitement, then letting you down abruptly.\n\nIn terms of audio, I was pretty underwhelmed. There was very little sound in the game, no change of footsteps whatsoever no matter what ground you walk on. The music was, well, I at least enjoyed the opening track? A lot of the music I found to be honestly kinda jarring and not in a good way. Usually a focal point of survival horror games is the use of sound design in order to create tension, fear and a foreboding sense of danger, whereas in this game it was mostly just some noise in the background, bar a few encounters with enemies that triggered music.\n\nSo how about as an actual game. Well, the enemies are laughably easy, there was perhaps ONE enemy out of I believe the four that exist in the game that was even slightly threatening, and even then I had no issue taking it down. The game throws ammunition at you, as well as health items (painkillers). I should note here that I used painkillers once in the entire game, when I intentionally allowed an enemy to hurt me to see if they even could attack or were non-hostile. For the rest of the game I stacked up probably around 15 or 16 bottles of painkillers that went unused because I never was even touched by an enemy. This is another key focus in survival horror games, you're supposed to fear enemies, you're supposed to have a need to conserve ammo, fighting is supposed to be difficult and risky, not a cakewalk with no chance of dying. I feel like the game completely misses the point in this aspect. The other side of gameplay is made up by some "puzzles" that either flat out tell you the solution to them by examining notes, or involve just process of elimination. Figuring out how to progress for most of the game was simply a matter of walking around examining everything until you get the solution handed to you on a platter.\n\nI don't really want to comment on the graphics too much because one of the big appeals of this game was the graphic style, the outdated low detail polygonal models and areas. I actually liked this idea, I'm a big fan of lo-fi visuals and I think in horror games it can sometimes contribute to the experience to have limited graphics. What I will say is some of the graphics start to contort and stretch in strange ways some times which honestly looks horrid, I'm not even sure if this is intentional or not but it reminded me more of a weird emulator glitch rather than something on actual hardware of 1995.\n\nSo in conclusion, while I see that the creator of this game wanted to make a homage to some of the classics of this era of gaming, I honestly think all they made was a mere collection of references to an era. The style was great, and as I stated before I really, really wanted to like it but it just simply offered very little as a gaming experience. If the aim was to make a small game that reminded people of the games they played in 1995, I feel like it fell flat. It missed the key things that made these games great: atmosphere, plot (good or bad), fear, and most importantly CLIMAX. All of those games had excitement, and genuine endings, conclusions to the gameplay. Back in 1995 offers only a trudging path of ambiguity and build-up. I don't usually judge games on playtime vs price, but more they experience they give, and I don't feel like this game had much to offer for the price to play it.\n\nShort version: Neat idea & style, executed poorly. Not worth the price it's set at.","April 28","false","1.8"," 106 of 118 people (90%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","90","106","118","3","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/AestheticGamer/recommended/433380/","AestheticGamer","AestheticGamer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/AestheticGamer/","3606 products in account","Back in 1995 is a retro-styled survival-horror game that takes most of its influence from a 1994 Japan-only 3DO horror game known as Dr. Hauzer and Silent Hill. The game has the sort of things you would expect from such an undertaking, such as fixed camera angles, limited supplies, tank controls. What may be a bit less predictable in the journey itself.\n\nNow, let me first clarify something here and now; this game is not in the same league as the Resident Evil's and Silent Hill's of yesteryear. It doesn't even get in the remote ballpark of that level of quality during the 2-3 hour journey, and reminds me a lot more of the B-Tier horror game from that same era. I also feel I should preface this review with a mention that I am a horror enthusiast; I eat this genre right up. I played every Resident Evil and Silent Hill game through more than once ages ago, and have played more and more of the genre as time as gone on; I have played niche old titles ranging from Hungry Ghosts for the PS2 to Deep Fear on the Saturn, I've played all the Dead Space games and recently Night of the Sacrifice (Ikenie no Yoru) on the Wii, more recent indie horrors such as Left Alone and Dead Secret within the week, along with a ton of others. I have become more aware within the last few months I am beginning to run out of older horror games to play through; I have dug into the niche and the mostly forgotten, and I am almost done playing through every horror game that released before 2004, everything from the more well known Fatal Frame games to niche Korean-only PC releases. I think understanding where I'm coming from will help me explain my thoughts on this game.\n\nBack in 1995 both succeeds and misses at what it is trying to be, and also provides an unexpected element that it also both succeeds and misses in. I'll talk about both elements here.\n\nFirstly, as a retro horror game. The game actually does manage to capture that feel sometimes, particularly the feel of the B-Horror romps from yesteryear. I would put it at maybe the same quality as Chaos Break or Deep Fear, if you've played either of those. Games that have some flawed execution and rough edges, but can capture you with some well deployed curiosity. The game has four main segments, and each segment does manage to be more intriguing than the last and put new twists on the game to avoid becoming repetitive. The combat is super simple and maybe too easy for its own good; most of the enemies can be taken out pretty easily with just the crowbar you start off with, and while enemies attacks hurt, I found myself not very challenged by the game. There were a few puzzles that were a bit medium-easy in their difficulty for me, but were a bit of fun to mess around with.\n\nThe graphics look a bit worse than they should. Being able to alter the screen filter is good (I played the game with the CRT filter on but no noise, mostly), but the texture distortion is a bit much (textures distort and twist based on their perspective to the camera, which is an intended effect). It was very exaggerated and in some areas made the game look incredibly messy. The music went between being forgettable and a few nice tracks, but didn't really ever help the atmosphere, I felt. I get the game was going for a pre-PSX horror game sound style more similar to Alone in the Dark, Ecstatica, or the aftermentioned Dr. Hauzer, but I felt they could of easily gotten away with more atmospheric tracks and nobody would of given it any thought. The monsters aren't overused thankfully (there's only a handful of encounters in the game), and while there's only four different kinds they are used sparsely. I actually like most of them (the last two types especially), but the first monster type I could never find remotely scary or creepy, which is unfortunate (they look like fleshy Pacman ghosts to me).\n\nStill, there's some interesting moments sprinkled throughout, some fun twists, a few moments that got me a bit to be startled or panicked, and on a whole I would say it was pretty alright. I think it's above the only other immediate indie comparisons I can give to this game, BlackSoul and Babysitter Bloodbath (some of the only retro-styled fixed camera angle indie horror games out there to this level). It's not just the most true to its roots, but the best executed of the three, in my opinion.\n\nWhich gets to a second element that many may not actually see coming about this game, I certainly didn't, which the game both hits the nail well on and doesn't. I'll spoiler tag this part, and would recommend if you plan to play the game and want to best experience it, not to read this, but I think it's important to mention. The game has a meta-game element.\n\nThe game a bit into it starts to do some tricks that sort of break the fourth wall, and they amp up towards the end of the game. We play as a character who is mentally stuck in 1995 and can't comprehend things that came out or happened after that year. Towards the end of the game, you think you might of finished the game (and I bet most will think so as the credits roll and you start the game from the beginning again), but if you play the beginning bit again he finds a more modern horror game-styled object which throws him off in how impossible it would be for back then, and then the game begins to disintegrate as he begins to realize we're, in fact, not in 1995. This element has a few moments that really do steal the show a bit, but unfortunately don't feel like they're pushed as far or as interestingly as they could of gone into. I also feel the moment with the creators comments could of been pushed to after the credits.\n\nThe story is pretty interesting, but let-down by a rather abrupt ending.\n\nStill, I enjoyed the game actually. It both lived up to what I wanted it to be, didn't live up to it, and surprised me in ways I wasn't expecting. It's not a flawless game, but I do think there will be appeal for the rabid horror enthusiast that are like myself. It's not the truly excellent and complete return to old-school horror I think some want it to be, but if you go in with a bit of an open mind, some appreciation for the older B-Tier horror game, and don't mind a 2-3 hour experience, you might find some things to like here. It could of been executed better in certain areas, but what's there is still a pretty nice game which I feel I'm warming up to more a few hours after completing it. Not everything I wanted from it, but a nice experience that did give me some things I wasn't aware I wanted.","April 28","true","2.5"," 21 of 34 people (62%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","62","21","34","4","4"

I'm part of that group, though you may not be.\n\nEven if you are, you still may not "get" this game. It's totally a style-over-substance work, but it's somewhat excusable for how well it nails the look of those fully rendered Playstation 3D adventures, such as Silent Hill 1, Echo Night, Clock Tower: Ghost Head and Aconcagua. Even if it isn't comparable to the length or objective quality of those games. The characteristic "texture warping" of the PS1's 3D rendering is faithfully recreated: every surface seems to stretch and pulse with your every step, making the world feel much more dynamic and ominously unstable than it really is. Since its presence in this game is as a deliberate feature rather than an unintentional consequence of the hardware, the environments and camera angles are laid out to take maximum advantage of its effects.\n\nUnless you are playing on an actual CRT monitor, I definitely recommend leaving the noisy CRT filter on to experience the full effect, and it's necessary for one of the game's fourth wall-breaking tricks to work. While so many modern retrogaming throwbacks would obviously never be able to run on the hardware they attempt to pay homage to, practically nothing about this game's visual presentation is out of character with a Playstation, Saturn or 3DO release from 1995, and I find that quite appealing.\n\nDon't expect a great breadth or depth of content. I finished it in about two hours (counting offline play), there's only two "puzzles" that require any degree of thinking, and there's only one room in the game with enemies that might actually kill you. Resident Evil 2, this ain't. The ending is very inconclusive, and mainly serves as a sort of developer's commentary. Despite these huge flaws, I felt that Back in 1995 was a worthwhile jaunt through some attractive and faithfully presented retro-3D environments, with a few clever "gotcha" moments and a palpable foreboding atmosphere. The developer is going to patch in voice acting eventually; if it sounds anything like the accented deadpan narration in the second trailer, it should contribute further to the overall feel and sense of 32-bit-era authenticity.\n\nCautiously recommended for a certain type of gamer. You probably already know if you'll consider it to have been worth your time and money or not. If nothing else, it's definitely better and less pretentious than most other indie "walking simulators" on Steam. Oh, and there is actually a deeper significance to the title, though like everything else in the story, it's never fully explained.","May 21","true","1.4"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","1"

You are Kent, a dude just trying to get his daughter back? Or maybe get to a tower in the distance? It isn't clear. But after a near blow for blow Silent Hill 2 monologue you're thrust into the “action,” as it were.\n\nIf you've played any classic survivals it nails the look (something between Silent Hill and Alone in the Dark). Heck, if you haven't just check it out on Youtube, then come back.\n\nSo it nails that to a tee, right? The aesthetic, anyway. But it lacks the twisted soul. The first few enemies you encounter are like sadder, slower cousins of the fat dragon statues in the original Dark Souls (sans fire breath), and you can kill them with little effort – every strike interrupts their attack. As a matter of fact, with the exception of one behemoth beastie every critter (I counted three, maybe four?) is pretty easy to kill and not in the least intimidating. There are save points at every potential encounter, bullets everywhere, and an obscene amount of healing items... and far as I can tell no enemies ever respawned.\n\nThe sound design, where a game like this (SILENT HILL) should shine, falls super flat. Prepare your ears for the same footfalls for two to three hours, regardless of whether you're stepping on marble or rug or steel. It got to be very grating (nearly as grating as my single speed – SUNDAY STROLL).\n\nBetween the awkward fixed camera angles and white noise/scan lines I was nursing a mild headache by the end of my playthrough... that's what Back in 1995 is trying to emulate, yes (the look, not the headaches probably), but searching for a key in a cramped office space for thirty minutes when every turn results in a sudden camera change was pretty jarring.\n\n“So they've screwed the pooch with story, horror, atmosphere... what about the puzzles? Silent Hill in particular is known for its (sometimes divisive) puzzles. Does Back in 1995 have any?” If by puzzle you mean searching through notes for a number combination then you are in luck! That is the extent of it.\n\nI appreciate what the folks at Throw the warped code out were trying to do here, but it isn't enough to make a handful of flesh colored turd monsters wandering around a boring, lifeless environment compelling or spooky or good. I didn't care about my player character, I didn't care about getting to the tower or finding my daughter, because I was given no reason to care. I encountered three characters, each one less interesting than the next... I just don't know. Then the story just fizzles out in the lamest way and it's over in just under two hours (that includes 20, 30 minutes of looking for a key or number combination).\n\nIt wasn't good. It wallowed in the past and fell victim to the same pitfalls (and then some!) of classic survival horror without applying over 20 years of gaming knowledge and wisdom garnered since then. Back in 1995 feels like a half finished student product: bare bones with some potential, and too referential to have a distinct voice.","April 28","false","1.9"," 53 of 97 people (55%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","55","53","97","17","4"

If you didn't grow up in the 90's playing horror games, this one IS NOT for you. On the other hand, if you remember your PS1 days and games like Silent Hill, then you MIGHT want to give this a try.\n\nTank controls, warping unsightly textures your eyes will never get used to in 2016, static cameras, etc. It's all here. The game is even presented in 4:3 aspect ratio. Don't get me wrong, it's nowhere near the caliber of Silent Hill or Resident Evil of the era, but it's a great throwback nonetheless. The story is pretty straight forward and short. I liked it.\n\nI do recommend this game to the few people that will appreciate what it's trying to do. To all the rest, steer clear. If you even have the slightest doubt that you may not like it, I suggest you don't buy it. If you approach the game with an open mind, and I mean OPEN MIND, and want to revisit the PS1 days for a couple of hours, then go for it.\n\nWith a steam controller in hand, I was happy to invest a couple of hours into Back in 1995.

I grew up loving the PlayStation and the images from the Tomb Raider 1 to 5, MGS, Resident Evil 1 to 3, Silent Hill, FFVIII or Syphon Filter 1 to 3 are forever stuck in my mind. I love the aesthetic from this era. I think for certain genres, survival/horror in particular, it brings not only nostalgia, but a sense of weirdness and it is forcing you to imagine the details hidden in the pixelated mess that some of the most gruesome games of this time can show. So yeah, I dig the idea of this look. I still enjoy playing SH and RE1,2 and 3 to this day, and I'm still saying "it holds up"...at least for SH and RE3. I say all that, so there is a context for me bashing the game afterward.\n\nI can "pray" the effort put into the technical re-creation of the PlayStation graphical flaws. You have the CRT effect of your old tv. You have the textures that bends when approaching the camera (a specifity of this console). You have the peculiar type of aliasing. The range of color for the textures and the sound design seems straight from this machine. So yeah, this could have been produced on Sony's first console in 1995. And you know what? It would have been a mediocre if not bad game, even for it's time.\n\nBecause even for a 1995's game, it's ugly. There is no effort put into the colors, the lighting, the models and textures. The most common monster looks like a potato with arms and the other three are so messed up and unrefined visually that you can't really tell what it is supposed to be. There is like no attention to detail in the textures.\n\nThe semi-fixed camera, inspired by Silent Hill, lets us see through wall, or through the character, and has no purpose whatsoever, neither in terms of framing, nor in terms of gameplay, to show us where to look. And this poor use of the camera is just one example of the absence of art direction. The characters have no personality and the story is not fleshed out and revolves around the oldest trick in the book. For once, I'm going to say that it is far too short, but not for the time/price ratio. Just because the story never has time to really kick in.\n\nTL;DR I get the idea and I am a sucker for the survival/horror of the PS1 era, but this is lazy. This game is to PlayStation aesthetic what RPG Maker is to pixel art. The base is technically there, but the visual artistry and the game-design mastery are nowhere to be seen. Oh and it costs actual money, when it's barelly enough to be on Gamejolt. You know what, don't buy this game, go play Banned Memories: Yamanashi for free on Gamejolt.","May 29","false","1.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The graphics, the sound, the puzzles, the general eerieness...this has it all.\n\nAlso, if you think you've reached the end, don't stop playing, just push a button when it says to push and you'll get a shortened New Game + where the game is re-arranged and also has an amazing developer commentary over it explaining the origins and intentions of this game, and it was great to see this included for such a unique game.\n\nI hope Mr. Takaaki can bring the game to other platforms as well, as I would buy it on all of them.","May 2","true","3.5"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

The very first (and extremely major) gripe I had from the get go was the CRT filter.  It has three filter options, CRT static, CRT standard and no CRT filter.  The static filter option made my head hurt immediately, and the game is unbearably ugly without the filter altogether, so I went with normal CRT filter.\n\nNow, I managed to play it for about a half hour before even the normal CRT filter made my eyes hurt, but by then, just about every other aspect of the game turned me off.\n\nIt has old-style tank movement, which is fine, however the camera was awful.  The monsters I encountered just looked like random pixel blobs and weren't menacing at all.  Extremely easy to kill.\n\nThe background noise is nails-on-a-chalkboard awful, and model animations are rough even for the era they were trying to capture.  I found that walking backward is actually faster than walking forward, after finding out there is no run option, just "relaxed stroll" speed.\n\nThe first couple of objectives were "go here and find this for me and bring it back" type stuff.  Truthfully, there was very little creepiness to it all.  It has all the other survival horror tropes, like unclear story and random notes to read and such.\n\nIf I were to find a positive, it would be the menu UI is simplistic and functional.  That's really all I got.\n\nQuite honestly, the effort was just too little for me.  I expected early PS1 era, and I got something that looks visually bad even by Sega Saturn standards.\n\nI really wanted to like this, and I'm sure it will find its audience, but just about every aspect of the game rubbed me the wrong way.","April 28","false","0.3"," 17 of 33 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","17","33","0","0"

I didn't realize at the time it was going to be a one-man dev team, literally as I was downloading it, I was reading around on the game itself and came across that bit of information and all my hype basically disintegrated.\n\nHaving already, in my mind, dedicated the next two hours to old-school survival horror, I figured I'd give it a whirl.\n\nFirst, this game supports quite a variety of controllers, which is sweet because this could've completed contradicted the point to the entire game - "an homage to 90's survival horror".\n\nThe game then next give your CRT Effect options to simulate the crappy tvs a lot of us in our mid twenties plus grew up with. At first I was going to skip this effect, but ultimately opted for the CRT without noise, as old televisions have given my headaches my entire life.\n\nYou start off on the roof of a random building, gazing off in the distance, you play as Kent as he is trying to get to a distant tower for unknown reasons.\n\nAs all 90s survival horror titles, health items and ammo are scattered through the entire world and you have unlimited inventory space.\n\nNow I'll admit, the first monsters I called the "Mr. Hankeys" the entire game because they literally look like a giant turd nuggets with arms. Which is pretty weird, but at the same time, I was infinitely relieved they didn't go with zombies. I've always a huge zombie fan in the 90s, but something about them wouldn't sit right in this game.\n\nThe first monsters are generally pretty easy to dispose of, three hits with your melee is all it takes.\n\n\nAfter unlocking a door or two, you answer a telephone and pass out.\n\nYou wake up to a doctor taking care of you. After of which, he sends you on a couple errands where you have to complete puzzles and flex your brain just a little bit to complete. Just a fair warning, this is classic survival horror, so not a lot of things are going to make logical sense.\n\nAfter a couple puzzles, some items scavenging, and finding your first gun, you find yourself at Central University Hospital.\n\nHeading to the cafeteria, the find the shotgun and when could maybe considered the first and only boss battle.\n\nWhich, by the way, the briefcase here can only be opened when your find the note stating how to open it. I found the code first and got ♥♥♥♥♥♥ when it wouldn't work. Make sure you go down the hallway across the hall on the left hand side of the screen, it's a little hidden.\n\nAfter a little site seeing, you get to the final area of the game. Which appears to be a luxury, rooftop penthouse. This is where things begin to fall in place. After finding a crank to open a drawer - yes, every survival horror game has to have a crank, somehow, somewhere, I don't make the rules, I do however fully except them - you start to find a lot of notes directed at your character Kent regarding his mental condition. Even going so far as to explain why there is no run option in the game. Kent's condition caused him to lose that ability as well as cognitive functions.\n\nHis mental condition is so unstable, he believes he is still in the year 1995 - hence the title.\n\nWhen your reach your final destination, the tower in the distance. Kent decides he's had enough and chooses to end his suffering.\n\nWhich not to take away from the seriousness of the story... but he was on rooftops the entire game... he could've just jumped from anywhere and it would've had the same effect.\n\nSome things I want to point out that I liked\n-Tank controllers were spot on\n-The monsters were original, the big one really reminded me of the final transformation of Berkin from Resident Evil 2.\n-The overall feel was definitely 90s survival horror\n-The save points were 90s computers\n-Glitches were almost nonexistent\n-Notes everywhere, just like Silent Hill and Resident Evil\n\nSomething I think need work\n-some of the rooms were just a little empty\n-I found a glitch that gave me unlimited shotgun ammo pickups, in the hospital if you go back to the rooftop and return to the room with the briefcase, the ammo will respawn.\n-Also a second glitch that I unlocked the "finish the game" and "get flashlight" achievements, but somehow not "clear the first stage", "clear the opening sequence", "get the pipewrench", "get pistol" that are all completed within the first 10 minutes of playing.\n-The enemies should be a little tougher, if you attack first, they'll stop moving and as long as your keep attacking you'll kill them.\n-For an oldschool survival horror, there's too many health items and too much ammo.\n-If there were to be a sequel, which I really hope there is, I'd recommend more story depth and more boss battles. The story worked just fine for this project.\n\nAfter the game was over, it did something I did not all expect. After what I thought were the credits, the game started over again without me doing anything. I retained all my weapons and items and figured, "what the hell, lets run through it a little more". Upon entering the room with the telephone, instead I found a flashlight. After thinking "what kind of creepypasta ♥♥♥♥ is this?" I turned it on and was met with some text, then the font changed to a modern style.\n\nIntrigued, I continued. I went back to the roof and there was a scaffolding that hadn't been there before. I then made my way rooftop to rooftop, each covering an area I'd already been to.\n\nYou find various notes on your way back to the tower, each one seeming to refer more to real life than the situation in the game itself. To me, the entire game is merely a social commentary on retrogaming and those of us who simply can't let it go. Those of us w ho grasp to that nostalgia, that first love we all had. It was new to us, that's why it was so great. We were young and everything seemed to pop so much more. Then we grew up, less and less felt new to us, and that first love became a only a memory.\n\nMaking my way to the end, this time taking only 5 minutes or so, you're met with the final text "Am I no different than he, who spent 20 years running away? Aren't we the same? From now on, will I lead a meaningless life. Is there no way to reclaim my own life?"\n\nI feel like this is the developer saying, 20 years ago when we were young, the ones before us were attached to Atari games and Pac-man. They refused to move on no matter how much we tried to   convince them Playstation, Resident Evil and Metal Gear Solid were better. They stopped moving forward, as have we - and if we aren't moving forward, we aren't progressing. We can't change the way nostalgia makes us feel.\n\nLoved the game, hope there is a sequel or the dev makes another survival horror. Hell of an installment for, primarily, just one developer.","April 29","true","3.2"," 10 of 20 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","10","20","0","0"

Game has a lot of fundamental issues such as enemy AI (easily killed because they are stuck). Setting up the controller is a challenge as the default settings don't appear to work for anything other than possibly the PS4 controller. If you are using an XB1 controller you can start the game with KB/M and then go into the OPTIONS while IN THE GAME. There you can move around your controller settings. I believe I had the layout of the steam contoller and the Dpad layout of the DS4 and it was working alright. Your notes/info section only holds the info for the last item you inspected (which will include a locked door) and you can't view older files found. Ended up writing down puzzles with pen and paper (by my counter, there were only 2-3 puzzles). Using weapons other than the wrench was difficult in the sense that the function buttons didnt work correctly. The gun would randomly shoot when I only used the aim button, and I had to keep hitting aim on/off to shoot additional shots. Unless there is a hidden ending, I clocked 1 1/2 hours to finish the game. Going to hit my save file to check another few portions of the game out as 2 achievements are still "hidden". Really let down so far with this game.","April 28","false","2.0"," 8 of 17 people (47%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","47","8","17","0","0"
