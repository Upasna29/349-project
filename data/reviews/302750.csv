The simple premise of turn based tower defense type gameplay where numbered cards must be combined and discarded to match the number of a selected group of attacking monsters grows deeper as the game progresses. Potions to add or subtract numbers from a monster's power combined with spells to move them around, stop them, or get rid of them entirely will keep you on your toes.\n\nAs the numbers get bigger on enemies and cards, it gets tougher to make full screen clearing matches but it feels amazing when you do and you'll score tons of points as well! There is also a free play mode where you can jack the difficulty way up that is quite mind bending as well.\n\nThis game is highly recommended if you like numbers puzzles and/or have kids who need to practice good math skills. Can't wait to see what else ends up in the game!","June 3, 2014","true","1.6"," 22 of 23 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","22","23","0","0"

It's a kids game targeted at children ages 6 - 8 or so, and this review largely is as well (or moreso: any parents reading this)\n\nThe game is polished & adorable, with bright colors, pleasant music, and cute monsters that are largely nonthreatening and quite imaginative.\n\nAt its core it's a puzzle game using pretty much the most basic of addition/subtraction- and while the difficulty/complexity of the math problems never really increased, it would have felt out of character for the game to do so.\n\nThe gameplay is solid & bug free, with a simple premise (matching the values of monsters on the field with "spells" in your spellbook. You can modify the values of the monsters, and add your spells for greater sums to be used in combos, not as a requirement- just for a higher score. Though clearing 7 monsters at once with a well placed spell is fairly satisfying, even as a 24-year old adult.\n\nIt's fairly long too, which is a pretty nice plus for a $4 game.\n\nIf you have kids learning math, I'd highly recommend this one. It's pretty easy to pick up, no stress, and just as fun as any of the more mindless apps on the market (Angry Birds/Temple Run, that kind of time vortexes.) Seriously, I would have loved to play this as a child, and still had fun with this as an adult. So if you're an adult that's bored and would like a time-waster, this is actually a fairly decent/low-commitment game as well!\n\nI also did a video review if you'd like to see gameplay/more in-depth impressions (kid friendly): http://youtu.be/QVl0dvIv3zQ","June 6, 2014","true","0.4"," 16 of 18 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","16","18","0","0"

Spells can be combined into larger numbers to take out more monsters at once, and potions alter the values on the monsters. It's easy enough for anyone to figure out, even for somebody as mathematically challenged as myself. As you progress through the levels, the numbers get larger, and new potions with effects like freezing a row are gradually added. The end result is an experience that's both simple and challenging, and most importantly: fun as hell.\n\nThe only way The Counting Kingdom can disappoint is if you miss out on playing it. If I was still young, this game is the kind of fun that would have made me late to school, but since I'm a an adult, it makes me late to work.","June 12, 2014","true","2.7"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

It's just so wonderful!!\n\nThe game itself is a turn based, tower defense game involving math(addition & subtraction), and magic. The design is splendid; the art, the music, and gameplay are all kid friendly. For instance, some of the built-in mechanics will even gently guide younger children to the answers if they become stuck.\n\nThere are a myriad of ways to clearing the monsters though. You can add spells together, and chain monsters together in various ways. You're also given potions with varying effects as you progress through the game, so there's a lot of creativity in how you beat each level. That creative freedom is what really gets me addicted. My favorite thing to do is take big risks, and let the monsters stack up a bit. Then unleash all the potions, and big spells in an attempt to get 'full clears'.  : )\n\nStory mode itself has numerous levels to progress through, and while you can revisit them at any time; there's also 'free play' mode with scaling difficulties. Oh, and each level is generated on the fly; so there's never any sequence to memorize. It's always going to be a new, and exciting challenge!\n\nA simply charming game for all ages; I definitely recommend it!","August 1, 2014","true","22.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It presents addition as a fundamental game challenge that increases in difficulty as the player continues. Unlike most education games, it's the game that takes the spotlight. The core mechanics are very strong, and the game develops a one-more-level mentality even if you already understand arithmetic. The potions and sorcery aspects are fun, and the overall aesthetic design is very appealing. If you, or your child, has struggled with addition, I highly recommend it. You won't notice you're learning anything until you already have. If you're already proficient with arithmetic, it's still fun. Perhaps pick it up on a future sale. It will give you 2-4 hours of gameplay. Overall my only complaint is that I wish it had continued on into more advanced math; which isn't a complaint so much as a hint to the developers.","October 26, 2014","true","3.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The monsters do not really have special abilities or anything, so it really just comes down to how to match monsters with numbers.

To do this you will have potions and spells to help defeat the monsters that are invading. In a turn-based, grid tower defense game you will be faced with monsters that contain numbers, only the exact amount of the number, or a combination of the monsters to a number can stop them. Can you take care of all the monsters before the knock down the walls?\n\nGraphically this has a light cartoony kids feeling to it. With the light colors, and the cute looking monsters you can see that this game is meant to be played by all ages. I really liked the layout of how everything fit on the screen, it wasn't ever too cluttered but it also didn't feel empty.\n\nThe map music is this nice light guitar solo that makes me think of story time. The in game music is a fun battle tune. The sounds of the monsters grunting as you select them does get a little old if you play for a long time, but its nothing that is going to cause you to quit the game.\n\nThe controls are simply point and click. You click on the next castle you are going to have to protect, and then you will be clicking on potions, monsters, and spells in game.\n\nAs you can probably tell this is an educational game that is masquerading as a turn-based tower defense game. I have to say that they have done a DAMN good job making it both enjoyable, entertaining, and of course educational. Sure it has been a long time since last I had to deal with addition and subtraction, but I tell you what, there was something about this game that made me want to keep playing the next level. My only true gripe about the game is that you were taken back to the map screen after successfully completing each level. I would have liked a smooth transition between at least all the levels in a certain area. There are a couple of different areas, and of course as the game progresses the numbers on the monsters gets bigger, but you also get more types of potions to use. These potions range from ones that increase the monster's number, decrease the monster's number, zero out the monster's number, move a monster to a different row, clear off an entire row, or freeze an entire row for a couple of turns.\n\nIf you are looking for something that the whole family to play, this is the game to play. There's a difficulty setting, as part of the game, so if you need to make it easy you can do so, or you can pump it up to be a little more challenging. All I have to say is that I couldn't put the game down until I finished it, and I was left wanting more, I wanted to save more castles, defeat more monsters, and though I technically could have started the game over again, I would be very interested to see what the developers could have given us as the next area, or hopefully area(s).

The sounds of the monsters grunting as you select them does get a little old if you play for a long time, but its nothing that is going to cause you to quit the game.\n\nThe controls are simply point and click. You click on the next castle you are going to have to protect, and then you will be clicking on potions, monsters, and spells in game.\n\nAs you can probably tell this is an educational game that is masquerading as a turn-based tower defense game. I have to say that they have done a DAMN good job making it both enjoyable, entertaining, and of course educational. Sure it has been a long time since last I had to deal with addition and subtraction, but I tell you what, there was something about this game that made me want to keep playing the next level. My only true gripe about the game is that you were taken back to the map screen after successfully completing each level. I would have liked a smooth transition between at least all the levels in a certain area. There are a couple of different areas, and of course as the game progresses the numbers on the monsters gets bigger, but you also get more types of potions to use. These potions range from ones that increase the monster's number, decrease the monster's number, zero out the monster's number, move a monster to a different row, clear off an entire row, or freeze an entire row for a couple of turns.\n\nIf you are looking for something that the whole family to play, this is the game to play. There's a difficulty setting, as part of the game, so if you need to make it easy you can do so, or you can pump it up to be a little more challenging. All I have to say is that I couldn't put the game down until I finished it, and I was left wanting more, I wanted to save more castles, defeat more monsters, and though I technically could have started the game over again, I would be very interested to see what the developers could have given us as the next area, or hopefully area(s). This game has to be a 9.2 out of 10.","October 9, 2014","true","6.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The lay out of the game is well done and is fluid during combat. Sadly it only contains adding not subtracting or any other math related subjects. The game makes the player feel in control as they learn, and leaves them with a sense of accomplishment. Its not that long but could be a teaching aid to someone learning the basics of math, as the adding count does not go above 50.  It has no major depth or progression in which would then leave people who just like the game-play style and not seeking to learn to be left wanting more. It is not bad for what it does, and is meant to aid in teaching, and I feel it does that well enough allowing the player to gain critical thinking skills.

Will I still play Warhammer: Space Marine? Yes I will. I would like to play games around my kids as well and then I’d also like them to play with me at times. If at all possible, maybe they could even learn something. The Counting Kingdom does this well. With numbers as your spells to cast on the appropriate number of bad guys, you should be well equipped for this challenge.\n\nLet’s break down one of the most important things for me lately: difficulty. The Counting Kingdom is as difficult as you want to make it. In its basic form, it’s not that bad. Granted, the equations get a bit more complicated later on by making you count a bit higher. You can overlap your spells to get higher totals to help clear the whole map and get bonuses, but you don’t need to…. but you can. There are potions for you to use to raise or lower the numbers on the monsters attacking your castle to help match your spells. There are also potions to move monsters about the board to help connect and clear the board.\n\nSo what’s the point to this whole exercise? Well, to keep a sharp mind and save a kingdom! Both of which are worthy goals. Like I said before, you don’t have to race though this game. The game seems to punish you more for bad tactical errors than it does math mistakes. Take your time and try to clear the board for a bonus if you can. Don’t freak, this isn’t a game with a hard grading curve. Getting three stars doesn’t take much effort and that’s fine for building up confidence in my kids when they old enough to know that I’m not just killing monsters, but saving a kingdom using mathematics as well.\n\nScore: Tasty!\n\nThe Counting Kingdom is a learning game based on simple addition math mixed with some tactics and strategy. They don’t have you do more than addition, but I’m not really sure how they could anyway. It’s simple, but can be as complicated as you want it to be while you can sharpen your quick math skills. Little Worlds Interactive went out to make a fun math game and they succeeded! Well played… I now know that I can’t do math with people watching from behind my back.","September 19, 2014","true","1.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The monsters and kid wizard have a great art style and colors that I love.  Even as an adult playing this game, I get a sense of accomplishment when I clear the puzzles.

I picked it up when it was on sale for $5 because I saw it on Extra Credits.  I figured it was a math game, and I like math, so it should be a fun little diversion.  It was, but that's where the problem comes in.  I beat the game in less than an hour.\n\nIn terms of mechanics The Counting Kingdom is quite sound-everything works together, complexity and difficulty are added in nicely as the game progresses.  It all feels a bit same-y though.  The difficulty I also found to be a bit low until the wizard was introduced: then it had the wrong kind of difficulty, and I lost 2 towers on the final level (the only tower losses I took through the entire game) due to the wizard hitting a doubling tile and not drawing any ways to make 30.\n\nI wish you could cast spells greater than 30.  That would have added a lot.\n\nThe game could have stood to be a bit longer, but I'm sure I'll get further playtime out of it with speedrun attempts.\n\nEven after writing the above I'm still not sure whether to recommend: it was a fun hour, but it's hard to suggest $5, let alone 10 for an hour of gameplay.  I'd suggest picking this game up if you see it 75% off or more, but I can't justify recommending it for much less than that in its current state.","January 13, 2015","true","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/subsidiary/recommended/302750/","subsidiary","Wicked Baggins","http://steamcommunity.com/id/subsidiary/","920 products in account","Plot of the Counting Kingdom: You are a little boy tasked with saving the kingdom from monsters using magic spells (increasingly complex addition problems). At the end, you are rewarded with a giant cake, which you share with the monsters, because you are a sweet boy, although in such case I hope you have not actually been murdering the monsters with your math acumen.\n\nGameplay wise, Counting Kingdom is a turn-based tower defense game. Each monster has a number. You have various “spells” at your disposal, small-to-large numbers that you must add up the monsters to equal. A handful of potions allow you to tweak monster numbers or “cheat” by exploding or freezing a line of combatants. And since spell numbers don’t always match monster numbers, if you can’t apply the right “spells” right off, the monster horde increases next turn, and so forth.\n\nI don’t think the game will ever pose a significant challenge to an adult of average math skills, but the sums, and the hordes, still get large enough to require thinking and strategy. And it’s a great help for kids transitioning to big-number addition (look! a big number is just smaller numbers added together. You don’t have to add all the numbers on screen up at once. You can make 10 out of these numbers, and 11 out of these numbers, and bam! 21!).\n\nAnyhoo. The Counting Kingdom is an appealingly designed, easy to learn, trickier to master math game.","March 25, 2015","true","3.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
