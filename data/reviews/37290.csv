Easy to pick up and understand. Decent music. Not much to say about it. Somewhat neat twist in concept of the standard "match these colors in pairs/threes" games, like Bejeweled or Columns, from the Sega Genesis era. While I enjoy it, I recommend it only for the casual puzzle player. The mechanics are simple to learn, and most games pose absolutely little to no challenge until much latter in levels.","February 18, 2013","true","0.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It lacks charm but it does have a neat enough concept of gameplay. I can't recommend it. Only buy it if it is worth under $1 or bundled with other games, other than that, avoid as there are better puzzle games to immerse yourself with.","December 24, 2013","false","0.2"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"
