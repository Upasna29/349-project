That said, it is not without its flaws.\n\nThe Good:\n- Lots and lots of replayability. You could get lost in this game on just a single city for weeks.\n- Your cities interact with each other to an extent. You can trade things like water, fuel, industry, and office services amongst the cities you create. This allows you to specialize your cities, such as creating an industry giant that feeds industry goods to your cities where you want to avoid polution, such as a resort town.\n- You can point and click your way through everything. Given how many options you have for roads, buildings, etc, the menu is easy to use and allows for quick access to everything.\n- The game feels like a semi-sandbox during normal play, as there isn't really many restrictions in place (and you can switch the building restrictions off in the settings).\n- As you build up your city, you get to a point where you realize it isn't just about building anymore. Management becomes a much bigger deal. One of the biggest management challenges is transportation, and that adds something to the game that I find quite enjoyable, making it a bit deeper than it might look on the surface.\n\nThe Bad:\n- Some of the mechanics for laying out streets (especially bridges) and buildings can make things a bit frustrating.\n- The whole Cities XL series are just reboots. They look the same, play the same, and feel the same. This makes for a bit of a hidden "good" I guess in that you shouldn't feel the need to own them all (I do and don't have any reason to play any of the previous ones).\n- They removed the online function that the original had, rather than making it work. The idea of being able to have cities existing in a "truly global" world definitely had an appeal.\n- The developer is lazy. The failure to make online work, some small problems and unfinished features, and the mechanics that are still issues still unaddressed after so much time just speaks to the lack of care the developer has for its work and reputation. They did "fix" things to a point where they weren't really game-breaking, but it still sits in my mind that they seem to want to skate by at this point (especially given how much effort they put into trying to create a great alternative to another "CitySim" game).\n\nIf you really like city management/builder games, this gives a good balance between the two and should be able to keep your entertained for quite a while. If you can catch it on a sale, then great! If not, you just need to decide what your dollar is worth. As far as putting a dollar value on fun, you have to do that for yourself, but even with the flaws, the value was definitely there for me given how much entertainment I have gotten from it. Decidedly beats spending the money on gas, a ticket, and some overpriced popcorn and soda at a movie theater for me.","November 25, 2013","true","52.4"," 396 of 426 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","396","426","0","0"

Very easy to pick up and learn.\n+/+ Cities can interact (i.e. trade) with each other.  This allows you to create specialty cities.\n+/+ Large maps.\n\n+/- Not as difficult as SimCity 4.\n+/- Not much different than previous Cities XL games.\n+/- Includes Steam Cloud, but lacks other features such as achievements and the workshop.\n\n-/- Lack of variety in graphic style.\n-/- Not map editor or terraforming options.\n-/- Roads & highways can sometimes very picky about how you place them.\n-/- Game slows down once your city reaches a certain size (very processor heavy game).\n-/- Developers have a bad reputation and have gone out of business.  Don’t expect new patches.\n-/- Unfixed bugs and broken features.\n\nVerdict: 6.8/10.  While Cities XL Platinum clearly fails to surpass SimCity 4, it does offer a unique and fun take on the city building/management genre.  If you can put up with the late game slowdowns or don’t care about creating larger cities, then I can easily recommend Cities XL Platinum to you.  If you expect more, you will be disappointed.  Don’t spend more than $10 and you’ll likely be happy.\n\nUpdate 9/7/15:  Buy Cities Skyline if you want a city builder.  This game is no longer worth considering.","February 11, 2014","true","10.8"," 188 of 207 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","188","207","0","4"

It's hard to put in words just how large and complex your cities can get, they can look so real that you can't distinguish screenshots from real world images of some of the worlds largest cities. in fact i cant think of a real world single city that has a population of over 90M. so what you have a people with low end hardware trying to build cities they can't support. and since its a 32-bit application, like most games, the cities can only get so large and complex before you hit the 2-3gb limit that windows imposes. the trick is to balance city size and complexity and not try to build cities that don't make sense and would not be practical even in real life.\n\nso yes the game is a 32-bit game with the game logic running in a single thread, but most other games out there have the same limitations. the only difference between those games and this game is that this game does not impose limits on you like simcity or tropico or anno does. also this games lets u pack the density of the cities to real world levels and beyond. in this way its more a city builder than a sim i would say.\n\nhaving said that the game, like all other games and software, does have bugs and issues, but luckily they are for minor and can easily be ignore of worked around.","August 18, 2014","true","21.6"," 299 of 360 people (83%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","83","299","360","4","1"

It features enormous cities and very easy-to-use interface systems to create a city EXACTLY the way you want it to look even with road-following decorations and multiple ways to plop out zones, then zooming in and "walking" around if you so desire - the level of detail is astounding, and I've personally been playing this series since it's predecessor, City Life, came out back years ago. The game has a major downside though - it's outdated 2005 graphics engine is a 32 bit engine not optimized for multi-core. No matter how good your PC is, the game is limited to only using 1 core and up to 4 gigs of ram - 2 gigs by default, editing the config file is needed to crank 4. This means large cities on even the toughest PCs will lag like all hell, while your PC shows virtually no sign of wear, often running far below 20% of max capacity. Community guides even state you have to quit and reload the game every hour and possibly even change your graphics settings far below what your computer should be able to support just to keep it running in larger cities.\n\nSpecs arent the issue for those of you claiming I have a bad computer - I run a hex core 3.5 ghz intel i7, have 64 gigs of ram, and 2 nvidia titans, and yet I clock as little as - well, 0 FPS at times. I have also tried it on a laptop running a quad core 2.7 ghz i7 with 32 gigs of ram and a GTX 680M with the same issues.","December 3, 2013","false","5.7"," 308 of 380 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","308","380","0","18"

This game gets insanely difficult, and fast. Once you get access to basic utilities, like water, power, and oil, it can be so easy to bankrupt your city by trying to offer all of these to your city at once. This game runs on supply and demand. If you're producting a lot of oil, and your city can't pay for it (not that your city won't demand it; they just won't be able to pay for it), your city will lose money by extracting more oil than what it can pay for. This goes with about a dozen different resources the game takes into account. You can also have not enough resources. This makes things rather complicated, because you will always run into a scenario in which your city needs more resources than it can pay for, even if you trade with other cities.\n\nYour city will always be plagued with problems once you get to a significant population. Traffic is always a problem. Always. There is no way to really mend the traffic problem. The tourism also really doesn't make much sense to me.\n\nHowever, I recommend this game because it's kind of realistic. You can't make everyone happy. You can't "pre-plan" your city by making interstates in a town with 200 population. You have to build your city up and then create those, causing you to have to re-route traffic and demolish structures so you can work on your interstate system, which is a headache I bet most leaders in transportatioon have. You will have to have a ghetto and also a rich population. Your citizens will get bored. The game is also beautiful and zooming into ground level gives a lot of awesome views.","November 11, 2014","true","22.6"," 80 of 93 people (86%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","86","80","93","3","1"

For instance (and this is the most frusturating) after a while, trading with the AI company is beyond worthless, its actually harmful to trade with them because the glitch makes it that you have to pay to get rid of your goods, as if they were plague infested.

Short and sweet, this game is what SimCity 2013 should have been, released a year earlier.  The game scales extremely well, allowing for truly MASSIVE cities to be build.  It has a billion different building types, large amount of road variations, and entirely different themes for all of them, depending on where you want to build.\n\nNow, that's all great, other than the fact the actual developer for the game is dead and long gone.  It's got the same problems cities XL 2010 had, and will continue to have them forever.  Those problems are potentially game breaking for anyone willing to invest a lot of time.  The major bug that gets near everyone is the fact it's single threaded.  The game will not use more than one core on your computer, so no matter how well the rest of your system is, a large city will cripple you to single digit frame rates.\n\nThere are a few other much more minor bugs that people complain about, however I haven't come across.  Overall, I find the game to be very satisfactory.  I've gotten pretty large cities before the single digits hit, and even then it's still fairly easy to play.  For a veteran and novice to city building alike, I highly recommend this game for at least a short try.  It's just a shame there is no more development on it.","February 1, 2014","true","15.7"," 59 of 68 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","59","68","0","0"

Where do I begin?\n\nCONS\nSo the game will work fine for the first hour or two but after that you should have a pretty good sized city the problem is this is where the framerate drop begins. Where this game does justice is that it calculates EVERYTHING unlike sim city which will take shortcuts. Unfortunately this means the game is very CPU intense and WITHOUT multithreading this game is a total mess. Once you use up that first core of your CPU that's all you get. It's like a trip back to 1998.\n\nDespite the new name and repackaging the game doesn't incorporate much more than it's previous installments. The same 5  pedestrians and the same buildings with very few added on.\n\nLack of any map editor or terraforming option means you are stuck with the same maps over and over again. The only terraforming option you do have is flatten ground wich can be next to useless and won't let you do much.\n\nRoads are very picky on their placement and highways are buggy as hell (tested them out using cheats). When cars get to an on/off ramp/section they stop moving. this creates conjestion on highways when you should be none. Bridges are difficult to create in a way that looks appealing and can take several tries and much wasted time.\n\nPROS\nLarge open maps of which the only limit is how fast your processor is.\n\nI could say more but if this didn't convince you to spend your money elsewhere nothing will.","January 1, 2014","false","55.9"," 77 of 105 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","77","105","0","0"

I'm a Sim City die hard; So I naturally like drawing my own zone sizes and knowing what will deveolp and what size they will be. This game has pre-designated zones/ blocks. So everytime you want to place one home you will place the same size block over and over (no zoning). But it does allow you to drag and drop the size and quantity of blocks you want in a zone. It also has a nice road building feature where you click to start a build point, click again to anchor, click for another anchor point, then  double click to end.\nPlus when it comes to building your city, you must unlock all of the features per city in order to build as you wish. You start out with very basic zones and access to all road types.\n\nMy biggest annoyance about this game is the achievements. While you play, it will pop up achievements, in a huge gold bubble right across your screen. And if you've earned many at once, they're all listed at once so you can't see anything.

You start, get your buildings unlocked and wait that people get in the city; then they start to demand jobs, and you create industrial areas; then you unlock the skilled workers (office people), and once they flock in your city, you give them some office areas, and so on until you unlock the whole array of buildings.\n\nThere are plenty, but mostly they are the same type, just with higher density. It is fun to see how the city grow, but at one point you hit the wall, where you have no more money to continue to grow. The biggest flaw of this game is that it give you plenty to start, but then it doesn't teach you how to get revenues. You may want to try various tactics before you get what you expect; this is time consuming at times, so the newbies may get surprised to see the city grow so fast, and then see that they can't do anything else because the money coming in are barely covering for the structures that you have (in particular public structures take quite a lot of resources...open few hospital and you will see the bill!).\n\nGameplay is fun; not sure why peopllpl don't enjoy the game...if you expect to get a masterpiece, keep in mind that not even Sim City from Maxis was able to give you a decent experience. The game is worth the discounted price, but if you pay it full price, you may be a bit disappointed.\nPerformances are great; some framerate drop happens here and there but no crash nor problems that cause you to get stuck. Graphics are great; compared to Sim City from Maxis and most of the other city games. Zoom in at street level and you will get a smile on your face.\n\nCity size is not an issue, and you can trade too, which is something interesting to do; here you don't have meteorites but you have to deal with class balancing; waste management and overall keep an eye to not make a residential area close to a dump and expec that people won't complain.\nAI is quite good too, looks realistic, and respond to changes; although keep in mind that it is still a sim city AI type, so keep that in mind.\n\nOVerall, if you never played Cities XL, give it a try, it is worth 10 bucks. If you want something super polished and optimized; there is actually not really that much out there, beside Cities Skyline, which is another good game but it is not leap and bounds ahead of this.\n\n6.5 out of 10 for me.","October 22, 2015","true","46.3"," 39 of 52 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","39","52","0","2"

Sometimes the city's management information is a bit hard to find, but it's there. You don't have to lay down power lines or water pipes, which I didn't like at first, but got used to. The roads can be curved in any way you want which is really cool.\n\nThe game is easy at first and the tutorials are good (not voiced though), but there is a big difficulty jump when your basic utility facilities aren't enough for your city anymore. The city will start to demand more electricity, fuel, water and waste disposal very suddenly. Also when you start building high density stuff the demands go up quite a lot.\n\nThe game also seems laid back and fun instead of taking itself super seriously. Just like Simcity 3000 did (And Simcity 4 didn't). It doesn't mean it makes the game any worse as a simulator, but more fun to play.\n\nGraphics look really nice and are freely rotatable and zoomable 3D. You can tilt the view upwards/downwards with only 2 presets though.\nI can't really get why some people complain about the graphics.\nYou can zoom in to see the details, which I didn't really care at first, but I found it's really cool to see your cities from the street level in the "postcard" camera mode.\n\nSounds are what you'd expect in a city builder and music suits the game nicely. The intro song does play a bit too much though.\n\nI have not run in to any compatability issues with Win 7 64bit, but there are many people reporting them on the forums.\n\nAnd the to the negatives:\nThe game runs fine when building a small city, but when the city size reaches 500k people or so it brings any computer down to below 10FPS in some situations (like making bus lines or zooming way out).\nIt runs only in single threaded mode, but also must be optimized poorly. Some tweaks to the game files help, but not enough to make building big cities fun.\n\nThere are some bugs like sometimes the trading does give or take more money than it should, some special building names or descriptions not showing up properly and one or two sounds not playing properly (police station is one).\n\nAnd then there are these logical issues. When you click a diskette image in the menu that is labeled "Save" and in the following interface click a save thumbnail, it LOADS the save instead of saving (there is a confirmation dialog, but it's too easy to just click ok). Also it overwrites the autosave instantly at that moment.\nThere are more of these issues, but they're just annoyances, not wasting hours of city building!","October 24, 2014","true","106.6"," 26 of 32 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","26","32","0","0"

It has tons of nice features, different buildings, good details, a decent engine. BUT, it lacks one very major feature: management. You don't need to manage your financials in this game as time isn't a constraint. Once you make a few houses and industries your flowchart turns green and you can skip forward to get tons of money. You don't lose anything by doing that. Just like the first Sim City from 1990.\n\nUnlocking some buildings over time and making some old ones obsolete when time goes by would easily solve the issue. There can easily be diminishing tax returns from old houses or you might have to renew buildings over time. Unfortunately in its current state the game is not challenging at all.\n\nI don't want to give a negative review because of only one issue and there are no other city sims playable but they definitely have to solve this problem.","July 14, 2014","true","12.5"," 35 of 49 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","35","49","0","0"

I don't have any of the crashing or errors I've seen mentioned anywhere. However, I'm not really impressed with it as a sim-game. Lot of neat details and things to do that improve on SimCity4, yet it feels half-done, or at least kind of indie-ish, despite this being the 3rd iteration of the series.\n\nFound this game to have a lot of potential and some great features, especially the progression of unlocking different building and zones which stop your from getting over whelmed and over stretched at the start. However it has some funny quirks and weird problems which do stop the game from flowing the right direction. Still any fans of city building games will likely get a lot of time from this and is enjoyable for the most part.\n\nCertainly the game engine is capable of some magnificent looking cities, and overall the gameplay feels pretty solid. But there are some issues present that hold me back from giving a more firm answer.\n\nGraphically excellent. Easy to learn. Manual is appalling for a game where you need to understand what's going on inside the system to do well. Game soon becomes repetitive and limited. The problem is that the internal systems are fairly basic.

I put dozens of hours into the 2012 edition and got this for about three bucks.\n\nNow then, that said.  Is this game anywhere near as good as Cities: Skylines (my 2015 Game of the Year)?  Of course not.  Not by half.  But there's more to it than that.\n\nSee, XL has one thing Skylines doesn't; a beautifully interconnected resource economy that makes building specialized cities so much more rewarding.  You can build a breadbasket city on a map with a ton of fertile land, an oil town, a manufacturing center, a tourist paradise...and the oversupply in one city is demand in another.  Is the trading sim as robust as Grand Ages Medieval or any of Gaming Minds' maritime trade sims?  No, but it's not supposed to be.\n\nSkylines is the builder I reach for when I'm after a "classic" SimCity-like experience.  I go for XL when I want to build something on a bigger scale, more like a nation than a city (in that sense, "XL" is an appropriate word for it.  Extra-large, indeed.)\n\nAs I write this, it's on sale for four bucks.  Anything from about $7 downward is a good value proposition for any game in this series.

Also, if anyone is color blind read 2 straight (there is the game breaker).\n\nI really, really tried to like Cities XL. I tried it more than 4 different times. I really love city building games but I always felt CXL was unpolished and unfinished. My game breaker were always the same 2.\n\n1- Roads and road layout. I am used to a grid like set up from SC 4, I can admit that. But I was never able to get used to not being able to make at least some consistent griding (it was always off and wouldn't stay stright and parrallel, so in the end I had less building space on one end than in the other). That wasn't that terrible. The REAL ISSUE was that I had to manually demolish each and every building to build a road expansion. And given there was no grid for reference placing was always odd. An avenue would not sit on one side as any 2 gridded element might but in the middle, taking up some space from adjacent building. And given that I had to expand a lot this was a nuisance that meant demolishing huge parts of my town just to fit a small avenue, casuse I had no idea what space it would take. If you are used to superposition building (that is to say, build on top of something else and the game make necessary demolishing) be advised, it won't work. (There is a mod that helps partially with this: you dont need to demolish a road if you want to replace it with another one of the same size, the rest of the issues remain).\n\n2- Lack of colorblind-friendly interface. Road traffic is codified in red, green and yellow strips over the roads (changing zoom distance makes it a little bit more clear, not that much). I am color blind, I can tell up to a point the difference between these three colors, but it is really hard for me when the colored area is as small as in some cases is. And there is no easy way to have the camera move to the problematic zone. You have to use the map to navigate using the color scheme I mentioned above. Also, when you click a road stretch you get the info on that specific stretch, including a colored ball with the usage. The ball is completly impossible for me to use but if you hover over it you get (at last) a readable tooltip saying usage in percentage. This a too repetitive task to be so hassle ridden, so each and every time I uninstalled the game and went back to play SC 4 that gets this fixed in some simple steps such as using blue-green-yellow-red for traffic congestion (not perfect but it helps a lot).\n\n3- Transportation options are really lacking for any SC player. Check the list, many sensible choices you may want may be missing.\n\nVery specific reasons but some may agree they are important. On the up side, farm building is quite fun.","July 29, 2014","false","21.9"," 28 of 48 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","28","48","0","0"

This should not be a surprise, however, as a city wth 250,000 citizens with jobs and traffic requires more caculations then an empty lot. That being said, there is some "work" that needs to be done to work around a few known issues where the game becomes really slow and choppy when left running for extended periods of time. (A quick google search will resolve those issues.)\n\nAlso, as with any city game, if you have an older graphics card, a slow processor or a lack of RAM, you will have troubles with a sprawling metropolis of 250,000+ citizens.\n\nThough it does lack the "driving mission" feature of SimCity 4 Rush Hour, this game is a superior rendition in almost every sense of the word to SC4, is highly moddable, gorgeous looking and comes with a solid sound track to boot. Resource management, city-to-city trade, a very diverse and yet easily managed Supply and Demand system, traffic concerns and the need for things like Holidays, Hotels and Food makes this a more detailed and realistic Sim City without the old technology and feel of Sim City 4 nor the various drawbacks of SimCity 5 (or Origins or whatever the hell they called it.)\n\nA great pick up for a city building enthusiast.\n\nCoupled with the fact that I got platinum for dirt cheap because I owned CitiesXL 2011, it was a must buy.\n\nSuggested Purchase Price: $10 or less.","December 21, 2014","true","41.8"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

At the time of its conception, Cities XL Platinum was a decently good city builder comparable to SimCity. The huge maps and tiny details were fantastic aspects of a mostly bugged game, however.\n\nFrustrating? Yes. Industries are very difficult to balance, not impossible, but nevertheless challenging. Cities XL is not an easy game by any standards, which makes it satisfying to overcome the ingame struggles. Every move requires thought. Expand too fast, your entire economy may just collapse, people will be dissatisfied, and you'll be left with blocks of vacant homes.\n\nThere is a plethora of selection when it comes to maps. Each having their own resources and physical features that can make or break your soon to be sprawling metropolis.\n\nThe UI is awfully buggy and quite confusing. There is a bit of a learning curve to be had which is a good thing, in my opinion.\n\nI purchased this game years ago for 10 dollars on a Steam sale and I think that was a fair price at the time. However, with newer and more refined city builders like Cities Skylines, there's no use in buying Cities XL, unfortunately.\n\nWith regret and disappointment, I cannot recommend this. I want to so badly, but it's too filled with bugs and unresolved issues that I simply cannot.\n\n~Krystal~","October 26, 2013","false","38.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","4"

In CitiesXL you are intrusted with the task of populating an entire world featuring over 60 city locations (more can be unlocked via mods). The objective of the game is to develop a world where cities work with one (via trading resources) to help sustain each other in the world. You will have cities that produce and export food and industry to cities that produce and export oil and electricity. In the same token, your oil and electricity producing cities will export to your food and industry production cities. It is so in depth that you can set which city exports to which other city, the amount of export that you are providing also can be set. A lot of people consider this game to be dull or lifeless, but that is not so. This game is not for the casual gamer, it is for the hardcore city building gamer who wants a true challenge in building and managing an entire world of cities.

Seeing the negativity around the latest Simcity, I was hopeful when trying Cities XL, but it just frustrates me in a lot of little ways. For one, it plays like it's in beta: text on the UI gets cut-off awkwardly, there are weird texturing issues with roads fairly regularly, it feels like it needs more polish. And this is a game that was first released in 2009, and has had 3 re-releases including this one! I've no idea what they've been doing all this time.\n\nFor all the efforts at making you vary-up your cities, with different resources available in different areas, specialising is difficult - I needed fuel, so decided to start a second city just for that, and found that oil-extraction isn't unlocked until you have a fairly large city built.\n\nThere was nothing pushing me to expand, and no real consequence to failure. My man city has nowhere near enough power, with -5 electricity tokens, and yet it doesn't really matter, and things carry-on as normal. It's trivial to make a city profitable.\n\nI'm also not a fan of the art style - the lighting makes everything quite grey, and it's hard to tell different wealth levels apart. It all just ends-up a bit bland.\n\nI'm sure if you're after a game that lets you be creative with building, you'll enjoy it - you can individually decide exactly which building goes where, and the curved roads are nice.

Especially given the alternative.\nAmbiance is great. music is appropriate and enjoyable\nGraphics are great even given the age of the game.\nThere is also no real pressure, unless you create your own.\nTake your time, keep yourself a rural farm town, or expand as fast as possible into a buzzing metropolis.\nChoice is yours\n\n\nHowever it is very repetitive and unimaginative at times\nIt also lacks in any type of real tutorial. There are technologies that are unclear how they work or where they should be placed. You can find the answer but it is cumbersome\nThe game locks certain tech based on your population which while good ends up making it feel more like a paint by numbers rather than a dynamic city planning experience. It also makes it quite difficult to lose, as money feels like a non factor in early building\nAlso as another reviewer mentioned, the roads will drive you nuts. They are horribly glitchy which makes your neighborhoods look like a 4-year old planned them\n\nOtherwise a very enjoyable game","January 6, 2014","true","4.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It does have its share of bugs but they are not crippling to the point of frustration or unplayability. I was not familiar with this franchise so this is the first "Cities" title I've played. I must say that I am impressed. The only major negative fact I can say about this game is that it is a SERIOUS memory hog and will bring a low end machine to its knees! I'm playing on a three year old gaming laptop and things don't get too laggy until my population closes in on 1 million residents. Usually shutting down and restarting gets things running smoothly again. My overall opinion of this game? This is what SimCity SHOULD have been!

Way better than simcity imho, but not as in depth city planning as the top games out there.\n\nThe 3d graphics are a disappointment, tho. When they anounced a lively 3D city, I didn't expect beaten up 2004 textures when zoomed in.

So for this city builder all I can say is some stability issues like what past people said like if your city gets too large lower your graphic levels unless you want major lag. other than that though it’s a great city builder, maybe not the entire best but also a real nice sim city supplement for those disappointed with EAs recent release too or just for people looking for a more modern SimCity like game to adapt to if they wana try something different. 8/10","October 9, 2014","true","63.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I did my research and found many outlets and users complaining of the technical problems that inhibit this city builder of it's theoretically almost unlimited potential. I decided to pick it up anyway, and it was a great choice despite these issues.\n\nIt's important not to downplay these technial issues, as they exist and are glaring. The game is still recommendable despite them however.\n\nBut here's the key: If you're willing to jump through a few hoops, this game can reach it's potental. The CitiesXL community is friendly and helpful as well as ingenious. Looking at the official forums will tell you how to modify the .ini files and point you to some RAM fix programs you can download. These fix the vast majority, if not all, the problems. Let's face it, you own a PC for gaming, why wouldn't you be willing to modify some .ini's?\n\nThese technical problems were borne out of some real shortsightedness on the developers' part and are not to be excused. However, since they will not fix the issue anymore, we might as well do it ourselves. The good news is the hard part is already done by the excellent community. Do some digging, and the results will make this game well worth it.

Do not buy this game.\n\nIt starts out pretty cool, you can build highways, houses, bridges, and right from the start pretty much start making the town the way you want it to look.\nBUT.\nRemember those highways that you started out with? You get upgrades as the game progresses. As you build more structures and expand the town into a city, residents complain more and more about traffic congestion. Okay, just remove the old highway you had when you first started out, and replace it with a newer, more-cars-per-minute highway, and that should fix it, right? Wrong. When I tried that, the better highway was too wide, I would have had to remove all structures on both sides, and basically start over to fix the congestion. Guess I could have just built a bit more spread out, but IMO this kind of crap shouldn't be an issue in the first place. Structures should just auto-adjust to whatever highway you're slapping down to replace another.\n\nAnother issue I had, was that (after deciding to try again after the above happened) I was really trying my best to lay out the city properly, and I'd just kind of stuck my city hall down near the edge of the map so I could go right to planning highways. Then later I tried to move it (and I have been able to on other saves), and for some stupid reason, after it was bulldozed I couldn't place another. Completely froze my game, no one moving in, no one moving out, no complaints that there was no town hall and the city can't fuction (that's what usually pops up when you remove it). I feel stupid that I just completely wasted my time, AGAIN, with this cheaply-made game.\n\nYou can look up tons upon tons of bugs that exist in this game, and I'm sure there was a workaround for mine (not interested so please don't flame me), but really, just save yourself the frustration and buy something else. It's completely not worth it.","February 23, 2014","false","19.4"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

No matter how much leisure buildings you build, your citizens will not be satisfied. No matter how many landfills you build, your citizens will not be satisfied. Sometimes, entire sections of the economy do not develop despite whatever efforts you make. (For example, in a city that had no agricultural area, it was impossible to develop retail that theoretically covers other goods as well, and in another, heavy industry, manufacturing, offices and high tech constantly screamed for more of the others while none were being developed because they wanted the others to be there in the first place.)\n\nOn the good side, it looks good, is easy to get into and is satisfying until you run into the impossible-to-solve problems.\n\nThe game has potential, and if tweaked could certainly be a very enjoyable experience, but it ultimately got on my nerves more than anything.","February 11, 2014","false","8.6"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

Then you better start looking right now for mods for SimCity because this game isn't for you. The Cities XL franchise and series has such great potential‎ to become on of the greatest city building games in the world, possibly outruning SimCity 2013. However the navigation in the game and the complex system in this is just to much. Sadly not very many people know about Cities XL. So what this means is that there really is no helpful tutorial for the game on Youtube or any website. I went through the tutorials (no joke) ten times and I still don't understand 1/4 of the game mechanics or how to create a successful city. No, I'm not terrible at games, but instead of learning from the tutorials, they seemed like they where just telling me a story, rather than focusing on telling the player what to do and why and other ways to do it.\n\nHow could this be fixed?\n\n1) Add a sandbox mode. Sure, there are the built in cheats, but you are still limited.\n2) Just make a simple navagation system. AND cleary label stuff like: Heath Services, Police Services, etc.\n3) Fix the tutorials. Don't make people suffer through a story like that.\n4) Possibly get rid of a few items, like only 3 classes of people rather than 4 and tell how to get them to stay in the city.\n5) To much stuff, like luxury items. Just have stuff like parks.\n6) Better information. I don't know what half of the stuff tells me. ( I guess 4-6 count as #1)\n\nNow for the grades.\n\nGraphics: 4/10 Crap, nothing more to say. Every thing is fuzzy looking.\nConTROLLS: 2/10 Read above.\nGameplay: 2/10 Read above.\nMusic: 8/10 Great background music\n\nOverall: 40/100. They need to fix what I listed or they really need to get more people to play and figure out the game.","January 28, 2014","false","1.6"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Much larger maps than SC2013, better gfx than SC4, and plenty of community mods out there (though not anywhere close to what SC4 has).\nI really was gung-ho into this game... and then that's where the problems started.  What problems?  I don't know, it wouldn't tell me.  It just told me people were unhappy... so I gave them things to do.  Industry wanted offices, but the offices didn't want to build, citing quality of life.  My quality of Life info-graphic in the information overlay panels, said it should have been fine.  I even had a modern-looking industrial park surrounded with parkland like IRL.  I don't know how I could have improved things at this point, so I opened more roads out of town, where it'd allow me to.  I also started trading, exporting goods, figured as with any REAL city that'd spur industrial development and hence income... nope.  It sure made the city some money, most of which went back into funding infrastructure and city utilities like POWER, WATER, and FUEL.  My cities, every one of them, seemed to start to fail at around 890,000 residents.  I provided bus lines when traffic got too bad, that cost a lot of money for my city (as it doesn't provide any income due to bus fares, I found that quite aggrivating and unrealistic by itself).  So I looked into other options, to build alternate roads... that option was out, even with all the park-space I left (up to 20% per development, and reverse-frontage lots didn't save me even with new-residential-construction work in my IRL past) to save space to add in larger roadways.\nSo I looked into other options such as trains and high speed rail... OOPS, THERE ARE NONE.  FAILURE... FAILURE FAILURE FAILURE!  Alternative transportation IS OUR FUTURE!  WHERE IS IT?   There's a subway, but it was telling me I had to knock out any building or park land that occupied it's path, so it was next to useless, having to knock down the whole city to build a subway that there'd be no one left to use it!  That was aggrivating to the point where I gave it the alt-F4 salute and haven't played it since.  It was such a nice breath of fresh air to be free of the simcity 4 grid once and for all, but it does not come without it problems.  There are road mods, highway mods, and other cool things available to help you with this game - even a no pollution mod to help fix some of the quirks that break your cities... but they could do nothing to save me from being traffic'ed to death.  I never hit a million people.  Maybe I just stink at this game, but I came away knowing that while this game will be loved by many, it needs work, a lot of it.  For the price they charge, you should opt for the new XXL version if you don't own this game already, as it's pretty much just a re-build of XL (this game) with a few new features.  Could I recommend this game?  No, no I cant, go get XXL if you don't own this game yet, as it supports multicore (which EVERYONE can use by now, it's 2015).  It's a good game don't get me wrong, but my biggest issue with this game is that I couldn't figure out from what it told me beyond who wanted to move into the city that I should be building housing for, is that what problems needed tackling.  Why is my industry vacating and leaving 50% of it's space empty, and not wishing to build, no matter how far I knock down taxes?  Why are the people truly unhappy?  Why are they unhappy with the commute, it's a CITY, it's going to have congestion, no matter how well you do on it.  I can cram over FOUR MILLION people into a large tile on SC4 (and am quite proud of it), but I can't seem to crack a million on this game without pulling my hair out (and getting lagged out once or twice, but that requires only backing out to world-view and going back in, easy enough and seconds on a modern SSD raid setup).  The new game (XXL) is said to improve on these lag-facets and some of the bugs, while some remain, I'd much rather send you along to the newer XXL version than to spend money on last-year's model (XL, this game).  If you already own this game, XXL is not worth the upgrade unless you're a die-hard that wants multiprocessing and a few other options.  Some of the pros if I haven't listed enough of them are decent size maps (XXL has even larger ones, reportedly), and abilities to build off-the-grid if you want, and blueprints to adhere to if you choose to...\n\nMy biggest issue with this game is the lack of trains, the lack of high-speed rail, and the difficulty of building a subway system.  I am sure that many people may criticize my feelings about this game... but honestly, while I really want to love this game, the first two dozen hours brought me much pleasure, the last several hours (maybe another dozen), brought me only pain and discomfort I can only liken to a stomach virus.  It takes the fun out of the city-building/management challenge when you're playing blind - not knowing what is killing your city - not knowing what is wrong and how to fix it appropriately before your city vacates.  I want a better excuse than quality of life... that's BS.  Take quality of life out of why my offices won't build where they're needed, and maybe you'll have fixed this game 50%.  I want alternate transportation... THIS ISN'T ROME!  We have trains/bullet trains/monorail/maglev is coming out now... let's look into the future, this is a game, not real life, DEVS - USE YOUR IMAGINATION!\nAlso, When I start my city, or even before, Why can I not make my own map?  Why is the terraforming so limited... it does not even change the gfx of the map overlay (e.g. if you flatten out part of a ravine, it'll still LOOK like a 2d ravine is there even though it's flat)... we want more terraforming options and better map-feature-change feedback.\nThis really IS deep down inside a GOOD GAME, unfortunately, the enjoyment of many is cut short by a lack of good positive feedback, as I might as well be having all the read-outs in GREEK, or be playing a racing game with the monitor off until the race is over.  Focus interactive is on the right track on the new game (XXL), honestly, they're getting better, but the mere fact that to fix this game will require re-doing it from scratch pretty much, I'd hold out and see what lies in store for the future.","February 10, 2015","false","29.7"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","1"

You start, get your buildings unlocked and wait that people get in the city; then they start to demand jobs, and you create industrial areas; then you unlock the skilled workers (office people), and once they flock in your city, you give them some office areas, and so on until you unlock the whole  array of buildings.\n\nThere are plenty, but mostly they are the same type, just with higher density. It is fun to see how the city grow, but at one point you hit the wall, where you have no more money to continue to grow. The biggest flaw of this game is that it give you plenty to start, but then it doesn't teach you how to get revenues. You may want to try various tactics before you get what you expect; this is time consuming at times, so the newbies may get surprised to see the city grow so fast, and then see that they can't do anything else because the money coming in are barely covering for the structures that you have (in particular public structures take quite a lot of resources...open few hospital and you will see the bill!).\n\nGameplay is fun; not sure why peopllpl don't enjoy the game...if you expect to get a masterpiece, keep in mind that not even Sim City from Maxis was able to give you a decent experience. The game is worth the discounted price, but if you pay it full price, you may be a bit disappointed.\nPerformances are great; some framerate drop happens here and there but no crash nor problems that cause you to get stuck. Graphics are great; compared to Sim City from Maxis and most of the other city games. Zoom in at street level and you will get a smile on your face.\n\nCity size is not an issue, and you can trade too, which is something interesting to do; here you don't have meteorites but you have to deal with class balancing; waste management and overall keep an eye to not make a residential area close to a dump and expec that people won't complain.\nAI is quite good too, looks realistic, and respond to changes; although keep in mind that it is still a sim city AI type, so keep that in mind.\n\nOVerall, if you never played Cities XL, give it a try, it is worth 10 bucks. If you want something super polished and optimized; there is actually not really that much out there, beside Cities Skyline, which is another good game but it is not leap and bounds ahead of this.\n\n6.5 out of 10 for me.","July 4, 2015","true","4.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This is one of the best city simulation/builder games ive ever played. You need to try this. Plz dont listen to all the bad reviews on the game. Those reviews dont help at all. Besides, it matters what you think. Not what everyone else thinks. Theres not much bugs in the game though and it runs pretty fast. The main point of the game is like all other city builders. Build a city, balance the economy, provide power, water and other resourses to your city. You also have to keep your income bigger than the expenses. The game gets more challenging as you build more and more and get through the game more and more, but youl get used to it. Overall i give this game 8/10. Try it now!

For such a beautiful game, the people, and cars, that they are filled with are more reminiscent of team America puppet dolls than real people.\n-whilst we are on the subject of up close and personal, when you get down to the ground level of the game, the failures of the game become that much more apparent, to the extent i will have to create another sub level to this review:\n\n1) The buildings. whilst the genral view of the city will be nice, some of the buildings just dont make sense. some are horribly out of place, like a snowy resort in the middle of the desert, whereas some are more of the "what the f*** inspired you yo do that?" type. i am spekaing, of course, about the futuristic building that pops up at random, and completely ruins the suburbia feel i had going on. its poorely drawn and makes me think the creators were high when they were designing the game.\n\n2) The landscape. yes i know i said it was nice to look at and yes, it is nice to look at....... from a distance. once you get up close, the "hills" become more irregular, and turn out to be weird bumps in the land that you cant build on. seriously, it completely puts me off and since there is never 100% flat land, you'll always find those hideous goosebumps around and about.\n\nAnother problem i have found about the game and people on youtube have mentioned this aswell, is that when you zoom in on the road, no matter what type or whether or not there is a single car, you will always hear the doppler effect of the cars going past, or the horn being honked at nonexistent drivers, by nonexistent drivers. again a sloppy mistake, but considering the grand scale of the game, it's okay to overlook something like this.\n\nsomething else, however, that everry city builder should have nailed from the beginning, is terraforming. whilst you do have the ability to flatten the landscape, it is expensive and often makes the problem worse, making me wish there was a undo button, which there isn't but would make the game so much better. so i tend not to use that when building. fortunately, the placement of buildings does flatten the landscape somewhat, so that you are building the item on a level area. unfortunately, this doesnt change the landscape around your building, and so i have been left with houses surrounded by huge slopes of earth or a jagged drop to the street. all of which makes you again, consider why the developers havent done something about it. but i am not a developer, so i dont know if thats something that possible to do, only that it's something that needs adressing.\n\nonce more, there are rather basic things in the game that are missing. for example the notices that appear. whilst helpful at identifying what i need to do like "more housing for skilled workers", sometimes its general like "something is wrong with the hotels" right okay then . what ? and it wont tell me. and sometimes it starts to tell me what to do, but then runs out of space and cuts of the message half way through. this is one of the most blatant and unforgivable failures, that the developers couldnt be bothered to extend the boxes for one or two lines, and really annoys me. and i dont know if there is any way to see it or im supposed to guess.\n\nso you might say: But then why dont you go through the tutorial and find out. i did and i didnt find out and it was nightmarish. the tutorial is a shoddy excuse for  a guide, and left me no better than before. the crap attempts to be funny with their stage directions and childish humour makes me really just want to get stuck in and find out for myself, which is shame becuas that is bloody difficult to do. there are so many complex things to work out like bus networks and trade that i feel arent explained in the tutorial to an acceptable level, leaving me to painstakingly trial and error with cities until i figured out how to make money properly.\n\n\nConclusion.\nas odd as it might sound, i actually enjoy the game , with its quirky music and beautiful skies. there arent many citry building agmes out there, so i commend cities xl for attempting to make such a complex one, even if they do fall short in some areas. as far as improvements go, i would like another cities xl game as  i feel there are definite ways they could make an even better game which would be well worth the £14.99 on steam (hint. wait until it's on sale). for example, weather features like rain or cloud, more detailed forests, not just some sporadic woodland.\n\nNOTE TO ANYONE NEW TO CITY BUILDERS. IF YOU ARE, LIKE ME, UNFAMILIAR WITH CITY BUILDERS BUT WANT TO TRY THIS OUT, GO FOR IT. IT IS A FUN GAME ONCE YOU GET THE HANG OF IT, AND THERE ARE ALWAYS PEOPLE ON YOUTUBE WHO DO  GAMEPLAYS OF IT FOR HELP. KEEP PERSISTING WITH IT, AS IT DOES TAKE SOME TIME, BUT IS WELL WORTH THE MONEY.\n\nhope this helps :)","April 23, 2014","true","32.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I like this one.\n\nThis game has a twist with the ressources so you need to build many cities specialised in their local ressources (oil, water, farming, etc.) and exchange with one another. Good concept but could be better.\n\nGraphics and sounds aren't that impressive but they do the job right.\n\nIt has everything a city building game needs and the fact I have more than 100 hours of gameplay proves that it's good.\n\nMy main problem with this game is that it starts to lag A LOT when your city is getting big. Also, you constantly need to switch between cities to provide the ressources.\n\n7.5/10","January 12, 2015","true","114.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Seems to cover all the bases, including a lot that Sim City has notably missed out on.  A very grown-up city sim.\n\nThe downside is that it runs very slowly as your city gets larger and larger.  This can become a problem as a population booms.  So many calculations per second that even eight-core AMD processors simply can't straighten it out.  It's a programming flaw that has been in the Cities XL series since the beginning, and the programmers haven't sorted it out. (It has nothing to do with your graphic card, as some mislead people might suggest.)  It is still superior to Sim City (a little bit childish, really) even with this downside, and if you're debating which to get, I'd push this your way.  Get both, they're now in the budget section!","January 15, 2015","true","34.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I will admit it's biggest selling point is the much superior visuals. I was blown away when i saw that i could actually get down on street level and see my city alive. This game is very pretty for the genre. But suffers from slowdown when you start getting into humongous cities with hundreds of skyscrapers. I have a fairly high end PC that never breaks a sweat on even the most recent games.

I will admit it's biggest selling point is the much superior visuals. I was blown away when i saw that i could actually get down on street level and see my city alive. This game is very pretty for the genre. But suffers from slowdown when you start getting into humongous cities with hundreds of skyscrapers. I have a fairly high end PC that never breaks a sweat on even the most recent games. So this leaves me to believe that the lag is simply an optimization issue with the game engine.","January 1, 2014","true","10.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It is a fun play.. the graphics and music are quite good.. the simulation quality is great.. but there are just a series of things which are annoying that can't be worked around. The building types are also difficult to discern from each other. Once you have built a rather large city, it's all an anonymous blur, unlike with simcity where various building types really do stand out.\n\nI still haven't exactly figured out the trading system. Either it is buggy or just not intiuitive..\n\nIf you are a huge fan of city simulators as i am, and are bored with simcity, i would say that this game is worth a try.

I will admit it's biggest selling point is the much superior visuals. I was blown away when i saw that i could actually get down on street level and see my city alive. This game is very pretty for the genre. But suffers from slowdown when you start getting into humongous cities with hundreds of skyscrapers. I have a fairly high end PC that never breaks a sweat on even the most recent games. So this leaves me to believe that the lag is simply an optimization issue with the game engine.","January 1, 2014","true","10.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Forget about Sim City... seriously... forget about it.  Cities XL makes Sim City look like an ancient relic of gaming history instead of a valid contender for the title of City Builder King.  Cities XL is much deeper than Sim ever dreampt of being- with more options, more economic concerns, and a level of interconnectivy betwen your cities that has not been attempted before.  I love this game.\n\nThat being said, like all city builders, interest in this title does tend to run its course after a few cities, so if I were you I would wait to buy it when it was on sale.  Worth some money, but probably not top dollar as all but the die hard fans will most likely chuck it into the back of their game library after 20-30 hours of gameplay.  Not that that is a bad thing- its always good to have a standby game to return to from time to time and to rediscover in all its glory.","January 6, 2014","true","40.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

These helped me a lot to understand what to do, like an extra manual. If you can see what is done in a game, then you believe that this is possible.

CITIES XXL IS THE PATCH TO CITIES XL THAT SHOULD BE FREE, BUT ITS NOT! CITIES XXL IS JUST A MINOR IMPROVEMENT OF THIS GAME.\n\n\nFirst off, I'm on windows 8 and have not encountered any of the so called memory leaks, it is possible, but everything leaks a little bit. It ran perfectly well on my computer.\n\nPros -\nGreat traffic design\nGood graphics\nLarge build plots\nDifferent types of buildings and densities for each type\nMore detail and less childish than current simcitys\nCitizens are tolerant to taxes.\nCons -\nTrade is absolutly terrible, computer will never make neutral agreements or trades that are a tad against the cpu\nToken system for trade is complex and not explained well\nCities get laggy because of very large size and details, not a memory leak, its just that the city is consuming a lot of RAM to render everything, bad optimization\nNeeds system for citizens is weird, more linear wants and needs(this goes up, that goes down)\nCitizen AI and system is not very good, you can build retail directly across from a house and the house will complain that it has no retail.\nSometimes you loose flow control on roads and dont regain it even if constructing a new road the same spot\nTrading is almost forced in the game, you can move into a region with none of a certain resource and it you cant make the city prosper until you make another one and trade with yourself.\n\n\nIf you just want to mess around with flow control and have fun building small to decent size cities, this is right for you, but if you want to make a massive global economy and dominate the world, wait for the new Cities, which is coming pretty soon. I had fun with it in the beginning, but the mid and end game are repetitive and the only change is how you format your cities.\n\nI'm saying recommend just on the fact that I do not dislike it enough to not recommend it.","January 26, 2015","true","3.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Good. Nice happy feelings should be flowing through you. All's right with the world.\n\nNow, think of EA's SimCity. You should be feeling queasy, if your keyboard is not already covered in yak.

Because Cities XL does everything SimCity should have done. And it looks way better... all from day one. It is really easy to use, you're not pigeonholed into these tiny landmasses you can't expand out from, and you don't have to be online to play it.

That isn't a thing with Cities XL. It's got this amazing feel to it, and it runs like a dream. Why couldn't EA have done this? And holy schnikeys, why haven't these Cities XL folks been sued yet? This is like a carbon copy of SimCity...only it works.\n\nPlus you can mod this thing like no tomorrow. Hell yes. Please and thank you.\n\nI completely recommend this to any SimCity fan.

CITIES XXL IS THE PATCH TO CITIES XL THAT SHOULD BE FREE, BUT ITS NOT! CITIES XXL IS JUST A MINOR IMPROVEMENT OF THIS GAME.\n\n\nFirst off, I'm on windows 8 and have not encountered any of the so called memory leaks, it is possible, but everything leaks a little bit. It ran perfectly well on my computer.\n\nPros -\nGreat traffic design\nGood graphics\nLarge build plots\nDifferent types of buildings and densities for each type\nMore detail and less childish than current simcitys\nCitizens are tolerant to taxes.\nCons -\nTrade is absolutly terrible, computer will never make neutral agreements or trades that are a tad against the cpu\nToken system for trade is complex and not explained well\nCities get laggy because of very large size and details, not a memory leak, its just that the city is consuming a lot of RAM to render everything, bad optimization\nNeeds system for citizens is weird, more linear wants and needs(this goes up, that goes down)\nCitizen AI and system is not very good, you can build retail directly across from a house and the house will complain that it has no retail.\nSometimes you loose flow control on roads and dont regain it even if constructing a new road the same spot\nTrading is almost forced in the game, you can move into a region with none of a certain resource and it you cant make the city prosper until you make another one and trade with yourself.\n\n\nIf you just want to mess around with flow control and have fun building small to decent size cities, this is right for you, but if you want to make a massive global economy and dominate the world, wait for the new Cities, which is coming pretty soon. I had fun with it in the beginning, but the mid and end game are repetitive and the only change is how you format your cities.\n\nI'm saying recommend just on the fact that I do not dislike it enough to not recommend it.","January 26, 2015","true","3.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I found myself facing almost bizarre obstacles that caused me to stop short as I tried to figure out a way to meet the growing demands of the populace. There weren't enough employees. then there weren't enough jobs, then not enough employees, etc. Whatever the balance was, it was difficult for me to comprehend. The game is very interesting especially compared to some other "city building" games from a more well-known gaming studio. The maps are quite large. I'd expect that after the player (and myself) could figure out the rather steep learning curve, it would be more enjoyable than I found it to be.

The difficulty is not compareable even to plain old first SimCity. The big advantage of this game is that the interface is better and there are lots of statistics to analyse.\n\nOne big disadvantage is the poor localization into german. The translation itself is good. Problematic it that most of the translated texts are longer than the original ones and simply get cut off before the end because the boxes they are written in are too small. Luckily I found out the game can be switched to english language via the steam menu.\n\nApart from that there are still some annoying bugs existing: Residential area building state they are not connected to roads although the area and the surrounding roads were created automatically with the corresponding tool.

His chronological position is much debated, Sekhemre Khutawy Sobekhotep being either the founder of the dynasty, in which case he is called Sobekhotep I, or its twentieth ruler, in which case he is called Sobekhotep II. In his 1997 study of the Second Intermediate Period, the Egyptologist Kim Ryholt makes a strong case for Sekhemre Khutawy Sobekhotep as the founder of the dynasty, a hypothesis that is now dominant in Egyptology.[1][3] His tomb was discovered in Abydos in 2013 and was assigned to a king Sobekhotep I in January 2014.","January 22, 2014","true","0.1"," 7 of 16 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","7","16","0","4"

At a sale price, it might be of interest to some of you out there and I am of the belief that there is an entertaining game to be had *somewhere* in this, but the money may be better spent on a multipack of crisps instead.\n\n","November 28, 2013","false","1.4"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

And no, it didn't scrath the itch. Feels like one of those games you can't really lose (unless you really make a mess). The game isn't especially innovative either - just feels very genric of the genre.  Infastructure's the only thing resembling a challenge. Still no biggy - just build more of it, or build outwards to speard the load, or maybe sprinkle some public transport on. The game doesn't get much wrong, but it doesn't much right either. The novelty dies quickly, and if you've watched some 'let's plays' of it on YouTube, you've probably already extracted most of the enjoyment this title has to offer.","October 17, 2014","false","12.5"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

However, other things are less inspiring.\n\nSomething about Cities XL makes it less fun.  I think its because it is more of a sim and less of a minecraft.  What I mean by that is that in Sim City I can build a massive and beautiful city the way I want and do so fairly quickly.  Cities XL makes you really work for your creations.\n\nMy other complaint is performance, on a fairly high-spec PC it still has performance issues.  This isn't any differnet than the Sim City titles that have been released in recent years.\n\nAt the end of the day, I would rather play my Dos-Box Sim City 2000 I bought from Gog.com.","July 12, 2014","false","3.2"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

Cities XL Platinum is essentially a DLC for Cities XL 2011  that includes the 2012 content. Oh, and yes... That's the reason why they give you 85% off if you already own either of the two older version (2011 or 2012) because it's the same exact game, but with added content. Same lag, same engine, same intro, same music, same everything... Just saome added new building, new maps, and what not. My recommendation? AVOID AT ALL COSTS. Why'd I buy it? To prove for myself that for the second time around, they haven't really fixed anything important. They just repackaged the game with a new name and sell it as a whole game with the added new content.","February 6, 2013","true","3.1"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

I repeat DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.\n\nFirstly, the interface of this game is horrible. They may show you extravagant images over at the screenshot area but those are without the interface. It does not look professional at all. Even the tutorial guide with the in-game characters explaining how the game works, it does not at all seem in the least bit a professional game. The storyline does not even gel well!\n\nSecondly, this is a ripoff the good ol' SimCity. I must admit that SimCity 5 that just got released this year has its many flaws that Cities XL Platinum could be much better at (eg. Population issues). However, SimCity has been around since 1989! Do you not realise how much the developers of SimCity have improved the game up till how it is today? I have a feeling Cities XL Platinum is just a unprofessional, fast production and cheap ripoff to point out the flaws of the latest SimCity 5. And in itself, there are many flaws such as weird controls and a lousy interface. What's more, lag increases as more zones are built.\n\nLastly, it's not value for money even at the Autumn Sale. Usual price would be $29.90 which is not at all worth the price for such a lousy game. Now it's $10.19, please don't be enticed to buy it! Get the SimCity 5 instead! Or get SimCity 4!\n\nThat's all I got to say about this game.","December 3, 2013","false","2.5"," 2 of 9 people (22%) found this review helpful","22","2","9","0","0"

The game dynamics are simple and predictible making the game rather dull... Build factory, add housing for workers, make workers happy by adding some decorations, rinse and repeat. No real strategy to it. To make matters worse some of the game play is outright unrealistic. For example, I build a farm on the outside of town, no reason for any traffic to be on the farm roads outside of a couple of farm hands. For some reason the game sends 30 thousand people driving out of town to the farm clogging my farm road so I keep getting messages that traffic is terrible. Bridge building is like hearding cats, complex and tedious. The game contridicts itself by saying more housing is needed for workers and in the same breath it says that workers cant find jobs. Some buildings will not connect to roads, you must destroy them and rebuild them because of this glitch. The only road upgrade is to make it a one way which is a pain considering you cannot build wide roads from the start because they are locked. Good luck getting rid of traffic jams.

Yes, the technical performance issues are slightly annoying, but for me personally, this did not significantly impact on the fact that I thoroughly enjoyed this game. If you learn to adapt to the flaws, and look at it as a positive, odds are youll probably find yourself spending many, many, many hours on this game, perfecting your city step by step and shaping it into the city of your dreams and imagination, just like me.\n\nThe large map space available to build your city on is a great asset and the game mechanics is generally easy to master and understand. Perhaps, the best thing I like about this game is the fact that when you put into your city, your passion, your time, your efforts you'll see that reflected in your finished city, and the subsequent feelings of intense pride, inspiration, and satisfication is quite something. And even then, you'll always finding yourself going back to your cities and experiencing the awe-inspiring realism that is your created masterpiece!!\n\nIn short, I would have to say Cities XL Plantinum is without a doubt, one of my all-time favourite games and would recommend it enthusiastically.","September 17, 2014","true","321.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game dynamics are simple and predictible making the game rather dull... Build factory, add housing for workers, make workers happy by adding some decorations, rinse and repeat. No real strategy to it. To make matters worse some of the game play is outright unrealistic. For example, I build a farm on the outside of town, no reason for any traffic to be on the farm roads outside of a couple of farm hands. For some reason the game sends 30 thousand people driving out of town to the farm clogging my farm road so I keep getting messages that traffic is terrible. Bridge building is like hearding cats, complex and tedious. The game contridicts itself by saying more housing is needed for workers and in the same breath it says that workers cant find jobs. Some buildings will not connect to roads, you must destroy them and rebuild them because of this glitch. The only road upgrade is to make it a one way which is a pain considering you cannot build wide roads from the start because they are locked. Good luck getting rid of traffic jams. I can go on and on... I am glad I only paid 6 bucks for this, I would be upset if I paid more.","July 23, 2014","false","26.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Despite the several irritating glitches, the game plays fairly well, with occasional FPS drops. City management isn't difficult at all for anyone who has played a game of similar style before, however, for someone new to the genre, they may find it difficult to get a grip on this game for a short while. While the broad focus of this game is enjoyable, the one thing that started to become extremely annoying after some time was the focus on the needs of individual areas of your city. At first, it's easy to manage personal happiness, but after some time, it starts to get annoying. Parts of the city often do not respond to numerous attempts at improving leisure and shops satisfaction. It often takes at least 5-8 shops for me to get one area to be satisfied with the shops in the area, and then I get new messages telling me to decrease retail because it's too hard to sell. Trading with various cities is also a task that is more complicated than it needs to be, and it starts to become yet another tedious part of this game after a while. This game seems to want to educate you more on the boring, redundant part of city management than the actual entertaining, meaningful part. Cities XL Platinum was a nice break from EA's money-grabbing, but it's a game I can only handle so much of at one time.","February 12, 2014","false","3.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Overall the game feels finished but unpolished, and small problems crop up. The biggest gripe is the lack of VSYNC (can't be forced via drivers either) so no matter what kind of hardware you've got, the game looks choppy and tears. The high quality shadows are a hardware burden and don't look that great, and there is no Anisotropic filtering option in game. Textures are lower quality than I would like. The game also aggressively renders trees of very high quality, graphically its impressive but its also a burden for an effect that isn't that pleasing. As far as gameplay, its fun city building, and about what I expected, in the meantime play Tropico or wait for this or SimCity to be properly patched.","December 23, 2013","false","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Not just in a slightly annoying way, but in a major chunks of functionality are just not there. It's only after a while of playing you realise that things like the leisure buildings and education buildings are either horribly out of balance for the game or just entirely non-functioning.\n\nExamples:\n* As far as I can tell, only one of the education buildings has any effect. There's no concept of levels of education.\n* Water is derped. If you want to place water towers, pause the game, place them in a bunch, then unpause the game. The water vanishes if you place one tower while the game is running, but if you place them while it's paused the towers work. Which one was the original game intent?\n* Roads clag up horribly. Since the roads have slightly different widths, you'll have to demolish vast swathes of city to replace them with wider roads, which don't add that much more capacity and then clag up again. I can't even tell if having busy roads affects the sim at all anyway. Everything seems to work fine even with most of the roads over capacity.\n* You notice more and more buildings with mangled or missing titles and descriptions as you unlock them.\n\nRecap: Water, transport and education appear to be borked. Pretty basic items for a City builder?\n\nSo that seemingly complex balance of budget vs city needs? .. Forget it.\nBasically it's just houses for 3 types of people and jobs for 3 types of people. That's your main task to juggle for the entire game (yawn).\nAdd a bit of class X housing, add a few class X jobs. Wait for them to fill. Do it again.\nOccasionally, add more power, and maybe pause the game, demolish your water towers, wait for the water to reappear, then pause the game and put more water towers back down ..\nThat's it.\nThat's the game.\nFun huh?\nI've seen one guy say he just totally ignored leisure in his build and it all worked fine.\n\nA few fans point to the mods available to try and save it. The main one is a UI overhaul which seems to add back in to the interface some elements that should have been in the off the shelf game. Not good. And there are things like the CLM patch (Crime Leisure and something) that try to fix the incomplete areas of the game.\n\nThe bad news (and a good indicator of the games "buzz"), is that the mods are now mostly very old and haven't been updated for ages. Two major suggested mods (PlazaXL and XL Nation) appear to clash in what they try to achieve and there's little forum advice on which one to go for because ... *nobody seems to play the game any more* < There's a big hint for you.\n\nAlso I've had it crash to desktop on me a couple of times now. The entire game just vanishes in a blink. I think the computer is trying to tell me something. Maybe it's bored.\n\nThis is sold as a complete finished game. It's not in Alpha or Early Access.\n\nIf you utterly love city builders and dream of nothing else? Maybe try it, but expect to have to figure out various patches to make it playable, and then expect it to crash on you fairly often.\nOk so... Even if you love city builders and dream of nothing else, this one might annoy you a lot.\nEveryone else should stay as far away as possible.","December 28, 2013","false","15.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Anyway, I do not recommend the way it is now. Perhaps the next one is good.\n\nGraphics: 8/10\nSound: 8/10\nInterface: 3/10\nStory: 3/10\nFun: 4/10\n\nAverage: 5,2/10","October 30, 2015","false","4.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I didn't have a beast pc, just a basic office one from Wal-Mart. I used to play this for hours on end(lag only occuring past 15k population). After I changed accounts, I recently came back to my old account to find out I got the Platinum version for free, which was nice. In my eyes, XL Platinum is a very decent city building game. I mostly just play it with the KIWI MONEY BANK LITE mod so I can make my cities however I want without worrying about money. Sure the game has really bad optimization, I was always closing and restarting the game every half house because at least that made it less laggy. There's always mods for better roads/intersections/light effects.\n\nBasically, I would recommend this game:\n- if you just want to build a city without actually trying to manage it.\n- if it is with mods\n- if you don't care about restarting the game every 30 minutes to reduce lag\n- just to ♥♥♥♥ around in.\nYou probably are better off buying Cities Skylines instead.

It's good, but do not buy Cities XXL - contrary to the name it's 90% the exact same game.\n\nWith this game however, I did enjoy it for a time but once you hit that certain playtime it just completely dies out. One main reason is just because of how hard this damn game actually is. I build an expressway, the largest and best road that isn't a highway. It's expensive and has many lanes going both ways (can't remember if it's 3 or 4 lanes per side) none-the-less.. I still had traffic jams BEFORE I even got to the "second phase" when I am just starting to get more options. Note that this is only within an hour of the game. Traffic jams. On a huge expressway.. WITH multiple other routes! Not to mention that the workers choose not to live anywhere near the place where they work, it's the opposite they live on the other side of town or out by the farms. It's just so stupid and annoying you have to quit the game if you want to keep your sanity.\n\nGet Cities: Skylines if you're looking for the perfect city builder. Stay away from this unless you..

Despite the several irritating glitches, the game plays fairly well, with occasional FPS drops. City management isn't difficult at all for anyone who has played a game of similar style before, however, for someone new to the genre, they may find it difficult to get a grip on this game for a short while. While the broad focus of this game is enjoyable, the one thing that started to become extremely annoying after some time was the focus on the needs of individual areas of your city. At first, it's easy to manage personal happiness, but after some time, it starts to get annoying. Parts of the city often do not respond to numerous attempts at improving leisure and shops satisfaction. It often takes at least 5-8 shops for me to get one area to be satisfied with the shops in the area, and then I get new messages telling me to decrease retail because it's too hard to sell. Trading with various cities is also a task that is more complicated than it needs to be, and it starts to become yet another tedious part of this game after a while. This game seems to want to educate you more on the boring, redundant part of city management than the actual entertaining, meaningful part. Cities XL Platinum was a nice break from EA's money-grabbing, but it's a game I can only handle so much of at one time.","February 12, 2014","false","3.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Not just in a slightly annoying way, but in a major chunks of functionality are just not there. It's only after a while of playing you realise that things like the leisure buildings and education buildings are either horribly out of balance for the game or just entirely non-functioning.\n\nExamples:\n* As far as I can tell, only one of the education buildings has any effect. There's no concept of levels of education.\n* Water is derped. If you want to place water towers, pause the game, place them in a bunch, then unpause the game. The water vanishes if you place one tower while the game is running, but if you place them while it's paused the towers work. Which one was the original game intent?\n* Roads clag up horribly. Since the roads have slightly different widths, you'll have to demolish vast swathes of city to replace them with wider roads, which don't add that much more capacity and then clag up again. I can't even tell if having busy roads affects the sim at all anyway. Everything seems to work fine even with most of the roads over capacity.\n* You notice more and more buildings with mangled or missing titles and descriptions as you unlock them.\n\nRecap: Water, transport and education appear to be borked. Pretty basic items for a City builder?\n\nSo that seemingly complex balance of budget vs city needs? .. Forget it.\nBasically it's just houses for 3 types of people and jobs for 3 types of people. That's your main task to juggle for the entire game (yawn).\nAdd a bit of class X housing, add a few class X jobs. Wait for them to fill. Do it again.\nOccasionally, add more power, and maybe pause the game, demolish your water towers, wait for the water to reappear, then pause the game and put more water towers back down ..\nThat's it.\nThat's the game.\nFun huh?\nI've seen one guy say he just totally ignored leisure in his build and it all worked fine.\n\nA few fans point to the mods available to try and save it. The main one is a UI overhaul which seems to add back in to the interface some elements that should have been in the off the shelf game. Not good. And there are things like the CLM patch (Crime Leisure and something) that try to fix the incomplete areas of the game.\n\nThe bad news (and a good indicator of the games "buzz"), is that the mods are now mostly very old and haven't been updated for ages. Two major suggested mods (PlazaXL and XL Nation) appear to clash in what they try to achieve and there's little forum advice on which one to go for because ... *nobody seems to play the game any more* < There's a big hint for you.\n\nAlso I've had it crash to desktop on me a couple of times now. The entire game just vanishes in a blink. I think the computer is trying to tell me something. Maybe it's bored.\n\nThis is sold as a complete finished game. It's not in Alpha or Early Access.\n\nIf you utterly love city builders and dream of nothing else? Maybe try it, but expect to have to figure out various patches to make it playable, and then expect it to crash on you fairly often.\nOk so... Even if you love city builders and dream of nothing else, this one might annoy you a lot.\nEveryone else should stay as far away as possible.","December 28, 2013","false","15.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Like, your metropolis actually looks like a metropolis. I'm not kidding when I say that your city can reach a NYC level of scale (though not population-wise, since it does that thing that all city-builders do where it makes population way lower than it seems your city should be able to accomadate).\nBad:\n-I'm only exagerrating a little bit when I say that it has the depth of a mobile city-builder. There's virtually no challenge from the get-go and I was almost expecting to have to tap buildings for coins.\n-When your city gets to a certain size, the game will start to struggle with processing everything and you'll get lag. Personally, the lag I dealt with was nothing too bad, but I didn't grow my city as much as other people did before I got bored and stopped playing; I heard many people say that the lag gets unbearable at a certain point.\n\nThose are the four main points, the things that'll really make you either like or dislike it. I know you see the red thumbs down, but I'm not not recommending it, per se. If you think the pros outweigh the cons, then you should totally buy it.

Like, your metropolis actually looks like a metropolis. I'm not kidding when I say that your city can reach a NYC level of scale (though not population-wise, since it does that thing that all city-builders do where it makes population way lower than it seems your city should be able to accomadate).\nBad:\n-I'm only exagerrating a little bit when I say that it has the depth of a mobile city-builder. There's virtually no challenge from the get-go and I was almost expecting to have to tap buildings for coins.\n-When your city gets to a certain size, the game will start to struggle with processing everything and you'll get lag. Personally, the lag I dealt with was nothing too bad, but I didn't grow my city as much as other people did before I got bored and stopped playing; I heard many people say that the lag gets unbearable at a certain point.\n\nThose are the four main points, the things that'll really make you either like or dislike it. I know you see the red thumbs down, but I'm not not recommending it, per se. If you think the pros outweigh the cons, then you should totally buy it. I wouldn't have recommended this game to my past self however, because this game is a little too shallow for my taste.","March 19","false","7.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I didn't have a beast pc, just a basic office one from Wal-Mart. I used to play this for hours on end(lag only occuring past 15k population). After I changed accounts, I recently came back to my old account to find out I got the Platinum version for free, which was nice. In my eyes, XL Platinum is a very decent city building game. I mostly just play it with the KIWI MONEY BANK LITE mod so I can make my cities however I want without worrying about money. Sure the game has really bad optimization, I was always closing and restarting the game every half house because at least that made it less laggy. There's always mods for better roads/intersections/light effects.\n\nBasically, I would recommend this game:\n- if you just want to build a city without actually trying to manage it.\n- if it is with mods\n- if you don't care about restarting the game every 30 minutes to reduce lag\n- just to ♥♥♥♥ around in.\nYou probably are better off buying Cities Skylines instead.
