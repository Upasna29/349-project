Oh, it looks so cute with the cartoon fish and stuff.  But the gameplay is unbalanced.  I assume that this was a mobile phone game with microtransactions, because it's too hard the way it is.  They don't give you enough cards in a deck to play without getting extra items.  There's a shop you can buy stuff in, but you only get a small amount of money by playing.  So either do a lot of grinding or give up.  I'm just glad they don't have achievements, especially a "get 3 stars on every level" achievement, because that would be near impossible.\n\nThis is the "Three Towers" type of solitaire.  Similar to Faerie Solitaire, but no where near as good.\n\n","January 12","false","1.7"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","1"
