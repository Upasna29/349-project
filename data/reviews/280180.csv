I’ve also made a tl;dr at the end of the review)\n\nThis is pretty much the game I've been waiting for since Mirror's Edge was released back in 2008. Hover is a much more aracdey take on first person parkour than Mirror's Edge, and while it's only in early alpha, I am having a tremendous amount of fun.\n\nIt's a multiplayer, open world parkour game inspired by the Jet Set Radio series that allows you to race your friends and explore the reasonably large portion of the first city. When I first started playing the alpha (I backed the Kickstarter and started playing in February), I wasn't a fan of Hover - the parkour felt a little awkward to use and it wasn't what I was expecting. However, after 30 minutes or so of running around the city and backflipping between grindable rails, it felt like second nature; it's fluid, fast and most importantly, fun. One of the coolest features is the fact that your camera rotates in first person if you do a front/back/side flip - not really anything that amazing, but it adds a nice bit of immersion to the first person aspect. You are also able to switch between 3 camera modes - first person, auto (movement is first person, tricks/flips are in 3rd person) and 3rd person.\n\nOne of my favourite things about the game is that there are actually different playstyles to use, something i've never really seen in a parkour game. As of the first alpha release, you can level your character to level 10 and increase your stats in 5 seperate attributes - speed, acceleration, jump, grind and hoverheat. While building your character in various ways is interesting and encourages different styles of play, the most interesting stat is "hoverheat", which allows your characters stats to temporarily increase by  building up energy from grinding on rails and doing tricks in mid-air. The higher the amount of hoverheat you have, the more your overall stats will temporarily increase, meaning you could be faster than someone with max speed or jump higher than someone with max jump skill. It's a style I haven't tried out yet, but I plan to try it out after I level up my 2nd chracter to level 10.\n\nHowever, since this is in alpha stage, it's important to note that there are some issues; my desktop has an i5-4690k and a GTX 970 and I still can't get over 30fps on max settings; this is mainly due to the SMAA and Occlusion setting, which brings my fps from 50~ to around 25, so I have learnt to leave those settings off. Furthermore, playing on my laptop (Gtx 660M and an i5 3210m) I get around 15-25FPS on lowest at 720p. Nevertheless, this is something the devs have said they are already working on, so this hopefully shouldn't be a problem for too long.\nTo add to this, while the city has been well designed and clearly built with parkour in mind, it lacks any real landmarks, meaning that it can sometimes be a little confusing to gather your bearings after mindlessly running through the city. There are also some civillians that wander around the city right now, but they have very little interaction and the animation when they are bumped into is quite poor. However, I fully expect that these are issues Fusty Games will fix –this is a game being worked on for just over a year by 3 people – progress may be slow at times, but the passion in the team is clear and they keep in contact with the community via their official forums.\nThere are also a few UI bugs and clipping issues, but none of these are major nor impact enjoyment of the game in any way.\n\nWhile there is a decent amount of content right now (60 hidden collectibles, a mission editor, multiple races/escaping from police and 64 player MP servers) Fusty Games are planning to add in more cities, more mission types, more parkour moves, a story mode that includes parkour and stealth based missions and a soundtrack written by Hideki Naganuma himself.  Furthermore, the current online community is fantastic, which meant that I wanted to keep playing even with having completed most of the content.\n\nIf you've enjoyed the parkour in Titanfall or Mirror's Edge but fancy something a bit more arcadey, you can't really go wrong with Hover. It's a fun game for a low cost with a promising future (that doesn't look like it'll be dumped into release half finished) and I can't really recommend an early access game anymore than that.\n\nTl;dr Very fun game that plays like a mix of Mirror’s Edge and Jet Set Radio with an open world and multiplayer. Somewhat lacking in content/polish right now, but it’s still in alpha and I fully expect the issues to be ironed out.\nI plan to update this review once every couple of months to let people know how the dev process is going.","April 6, 2015","true","27.7"," 106 of 116 people (91%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","91","106","116","8","8"

This was a dream game for me. I love parkour games like Mirrors Edge, and Jet Set Radio is probably my favorite franchises ever. So this mis match of those 2 games was a euphoric expierence.\n\nAt release this game had its fair share of issues. Bad performance, glitches out the wazoo, only 2 music tracks, little to no content, and other such things. But it was expected since it was an early access game, and it's still in Alpha too so thats a factor. I don't have a high end gaming PC, so my best performance was about 20 frames, and that was at very best. I sucked it up and played the game anyways, considering how hyped I was. I wasn't entirely disappointed. I still had fun even with all the flaws.\n\nMonths pass\n\nThen the 3.0 update comes out\n\nAs of this update, the game has gotten significantly better. The frame rate as tripled from the old version to this one. The new city is much better than the older one. The two new songs sort of break up the monotony of the other songs, but there still isn't too much to the soundtrack so far. I highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoyed Mirror's Edge or any other type of parkour game. It can only get better from this point.","April 7, 2015","true","28.9"," 39 of 43 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","39","43","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MaskedRider/recommended/280180/","MaskedRider","Masked Rider","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MaskedRider/","210 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nOUTDATED REVIEW!!!\nAlright, let me get this out of the way, I am having a ton of fun with this game so far. It's a very colorful, very cool looking, and a very fun game to play. The game gives you freedom to platform and parkour all over (half) a city, with option to do missions (be it races or taking a thing and throwing it into a thing into another thing) to level up and increase the stats of what your character can do. The controls are pretty responsive (I'm playing on a Xbox One controller), it's a bit slippery, but it works because it gives the feeling of momentum, and tells you to slow down if you want to make a good turn or not fall off a building. This game is still in Early Access, and really there are way worse games out there that are in the same catagory, so this feels more complete than other games of its nature.\n\nSo it saddens me to say that I cannot really recomend people to pay $20 for the game just yet, or if you do, pay attention to what I have to say so you know what you're getting into. While you can attribute to the game being in Early Access (alpha state), then it's most important that I state these flaws now so the devs can improve on the game before it can be considered a full legit game. Also just because it's in early access doesn't mean I can't criticizes it. I payed $20 on this game, I can state the flaws of the product if I want to, plus I have 4+ hours in this game.\n\n-No story: The game technically has a story, but it's pretty shallow and doesn't really move forward at all. You are a guy and you wake up in a... place. You are told by some other teens that games have been taken away by the government empire society yadayadayada. It's pretty meh, but it can be presented as fun or tounge in cheek, but it seems a bit half ♥♥♥♥♥. The 3 members of the revolution are cool looking characters themselves, and each have something of a personality, but it's all told through in game chat boxes with images of the characters. Then some other characters show up with no context and say things, and leave. Really, it seems like the story needs something, like to be there.\n\n-Bad FPS: FPS being frames per second. The game has no FPS cap, but from my experience, it's highest is maybe 40. It could be my com♥♥♥♥r, but the Frame Rate drops considerdably down a lot, to as low as 15 or 10, and with this speedy game, that is a not good thing. Not good at all.\n\n-Shallow parkour: The gameplay feels a bit shallow. And by bit I mean a lot. The game is pretty fluid, jumping from wall to wall is good, parkouring all around feels nice, BUT it's basic. And the game has a focus on parkouring, it's in the tag! Other then sliding and jumping for tricks, and super hopping after falling for 167 feet from the air and pressing jump, the game feels like it needs more before it gets pretty stale and repetitive. You can do tricks in the air, but that's just pressing a button, posing, and not much happening. I remember the KickStarter having points in the gameplay, which would have actually made the game feel more fun (like the style meter in the DMC games) but because it's not there, there doesn't seem to be any reward for doing cool stuff other than for the sake for it. And really, this game needs some fun tricks, like pole spinning, or car balancing, or something, anything.\n\n-Repetitive missions: I said earlier that there are missions, and I only gave 2 examples. That's because that's the only type of missions of the game. Racing is racing, though there is 3 different types of it. V1 is racing by yourself agaisnt the clock. V2 is you against an AI opponent. V3 is you against someone online. Go through checkpoints, 3 laps, done. They are good in that you have to be clever in figuring out short cuts or how to get to the next point faster, but it's still just racing. The other type is taking an object called the gamerball, which looks like a fat gamecube, and tossing it into an X. You can't do tricks, and you can get lost by following the arrow because stuff can be in the way of the objective. There's also this flying droid that sometimes follows you and shocks you for you to drop the gamerball. It hinders the mission already because what else do I need in a mission where it's easy to get lost in, a droid that makes me drop the maguffin.\n\n-Focus too much on online: The game is obvious to be making you go play online with other people and do stuff, which may explain why the game feels so MMO in it's story approch. You are generic guy, here is noob tube, you train, you out of tube, bye-bye! And honestly, being online feels pretty shallow.  Usually people are doing their own thing since there is no real encouragement to go do stuff with other players other than... nothing. So because of this, there seems to be a lack of single player offline care.\n\n-$20: It's too pricy right now honestly. For $20, I could of gotten a few games off Steam or GOG or PSN or Origin or Wii U or Xbox Live, go out to see a movie with snacks, buy a cool toy, save up for something special, get a magizine subcription, buy some books. Basically get something complete instead of something not even finished.\n\n-Color pallet: If you love/hate orange and blue contrast, you'll love/hate this game. This game presents itself as a colorful throwback to the Sega Dreamcast days, where games were full of color and life. But this game does the cheap orange/blue contrast trick that movies and games trying to be movies do now-a-days. Jet Set Radio did not do the orange/blue trick, it used a nice pallet to give the player something nice and unique to look at. This game sadly does not look unique because of this orange/blue choice.\n\n-Lifeless citizens: Holy heck these citizens barely do anything, other than walk. And call me a racist if you want, but they all look the same.\n\n-No real threats: Remember the flying shock droid I mentioned earlier? Yeah, he's your only threat, other than cameras that make laser walls that not allow you to go through coridiors, even if you can and will find ways around them. I'm supposed to be part in a team of gaming freedom fighters, but never do I feel like I am one since I never fight anything, or at least GTFO myself away from baddies (like in Jet Set Radio, the game that influenced this game a lot, other than Mirriors Edge, which also had enimies).\n\n-Not enough music: Even though this game got some help by the composer of Jet Set Radio, Hideki Naganuma, there is only 2 tunes in this game so far. Basic world music, and racing music. And honestly, it doesn't sound like his style of music. Compare the music in this game to JTS or Sonic Rush, it just sounds way different. Also the 2 tracks have already gotten repetitive. Maybe an ingame radio would be nice, to cycle through songs and stuff.\n\n-Level cap too low: Just 10, and I have like 4 or 5 different types of areas I can upgrade, of which 3 points is the highest I can give to each. I'm gonna focus on certain aspects of the charcter growth over others, and be done with it quick, and regret my desicion later.\n\n-World layout is forgetable: While it looks nice, the game doesn't really have too many places you can say is memorable, other than the rusty metal shack looking places that are next to each other attacheted to the walls and each other through stuff, and the slime waterfall. This is a huge issue for me, because you can get lost easy in this game, and look as if you're going circles everywhere. This game needs more visually more reconizable local, pinpoints that can make you go "oh, I remember that place, I know where I am!"\n\n-Online issues: It could just be me, but after the most recent update, I can't seem to get online. My wi-fi has been acting not goot recenlty though, so it could just be me.\n\nThis game has great potential to be one of the most fun and unique parkour games out there to date (what few there are though), but it also can screw that up badly if it doesn't fix these issues ASAP.","April 18, 2015","false","5.0"," 63 of 88 people (72%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","72","63","88","4","11"

Jumping as a function feels very easy to get used to and easy to control. One thing I would change about the jumping mechanic is when a player crouch jumps off a wall. It feels as though if slightly more momentum was maintained after a wall-jump it could open new routes of exploration for players. Other than that, the jumping is practically flawless in terms of momentum. Perhaps some blur effects around the edges of the screen when a player is going at maximum speed could be added to give a sensation of speed, but that’s not necessarily important in terms of how the character moves.\nIn terms of grinding, I feel that grinding by default should be faster, or the upgrades to the skill should have more effect. This could give the player the option to risk taking a grind-based route to get a faster time, leading to more competition, more ways to explore a course and more replay-ability. As the present time, unless an object which I can grind on will prevent a fall, I almost never grind, simply because running is a faster alternative. On the other end of the spectrum, making an example of the original Jet Set Radio, players were encouraged to predominantly use rails because of how slow the characters’ ground speed was. A middle ground for these two styles of movement would allow players to almost completely define their own way of navigating a map. On a lighter side of grinding, I adore that players can lean to either side while doing so. It makes grinding more interactive as opposed to holding a button until switching rail.\nThe controls are brilliantly simple and easy to pick up, and are very similar to mirrors edge in terms of number of different buttons needed. This allows players many different rebind configurations. The only problem I’ve faced is a slight difficulty in spray painting and perhaps having the option of having its on key binding would resolve it. Other than that, no complaints about how it controls.\nOne thing I like is how the level design was built for both players who like to either just run fast or precisely navigate courses; this is done by having area with narrow passages, areas with long stretches of both road and rails, and areas with both. Being able to choose a spawn point is an excellent convenience when you find an area you prefer, I use it often and I know that other users use that, and the teleport feature, often.\nIt’s not often a map is almost as vertical as it is horizontal but in this case it works fantastically. Falling from the well lit height of the city into garbage village feels extremely smooth and emphasises the dystopian world created.\nA small feature I would like to see added would be to see more numerical values when selecting a character DNA or when levelling up attributes, such as top speed, acceleration, top grind speed, etc. so that players can have a more clear idea of what character build they can go for.\nAt this point in time, most of the features I am hoping for, that are not in the game, are probably in development, such as being able to form a group, more complex mission editor, more enemies (perhaps humanoid chasing enemies?) and a map screen are in development so I won’t bother detailing them.\nOverall I’m excited to follow this games progress and see how the final release looks. Until then, I will keep recommending it to people who enjoyed games similar.","January 19","true","67.0"," 15 of 15 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","15","15","0","1"

This game is a parkour game where you scale buildings and walls, run away from cops, race against other people or the computer and collect collectibles. It has beautiful graphics that remind me of borderlands, and has gameplay similar to mirror's edge. It is very enjoyable, and well worth giving a shot. However, since it's in alpha mode there are a few problems, most notably that the game will crash every so often, but this is most likely going to be fixed in the near future. At the moment it is also strictly a free-roaming game, with almost no story, and only missions to complete. The final game will have a story arc, but the alpha version does not, which you should consider before buying the alpha version. Other than that, this game is very addictive, and I can see myself spending hours on this game. I posted a quick review and gameplay footage of the game below, enjoy!\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ulu81RvUCI4&index=1&list=PLKMxTuqznyPOoCRgnvWGfddbR_REEl7AV","April 6, 2015","true","1.4"," 25 of 33 people (76%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","76","25","33","5","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/RedCalx/recommended/280180/","RedCalx","☭Aphex☭","http://steamcommunity.com/id/RedCalx/","176 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nOverview and Description\nUnlike other reviewers, I'm unfortunately not a backer from the Kickstarter. I got the game today, and as I play more the review will be updated as such. Anyway, let's jump right into the deep end here. This is NEW. I have never in my life experienced anything like it. The way the gaming industry operates nowadays is depressing. It's all rip off after rip off, but this is so much different. The feeling you get when you're skating around the city, mastering your routes and getting faster and faster than ever before is an experience I know well from games like the Tony Hawk series or Jet Set Radio, but it feels so much different on this game. In all other skating games, you're bound to the track, basically. You have quite a lot of freedom, but the route is defined. In Hover, you're free. You find your own damn route, and you take it.\n\nThe Story\nThe concept of the story is that you're in a city where games consoles are banned by the authoritarian leaders, and you're part of a rebel group that opposes them. I've ot played too far into the game's story, so unfortunately I don't know what it's like. One thing you'll have to understand is that this game isn't about the story. It's about the experience of skating. Once you get into the game and get past the short tutorial, you couldn't care less about the story.\n\nGameplay and Controls\nThe game's control system comes with mouse/keyboard controls and a default Xbox 360 controller mode, which I've been using and enjoying. It's fully customisable, so if you don't like any of the bindings you can change it. So far, the gameplay feel has been absolutely great, but it there are a few bits that annoy me. For example, when you're jumping from wall to wall, the camera angle makes it easy to lose youself and ruin your moveset. The first-person feel to the game is immersive, and I can imagine that it would be absolutely phenomenal on the oculus rift. I must add though, that the controls and gameplay takes some getting used to. It's not too steep, but there certainly is a learning curve.\n\nGraphics\nThe graphics of the game are lovely and appealing, but that's because they fit the styling of the game perfectly. The textures are pretty smooth, and there aren't many graphical bugs which I've found. BUT I'm not able to play the game well in high detail, an issue I shall be touching on soon.\n\nMusic\nAbsolute eargasm. You just have to listen to it to undeerstand. It portrays the feel of the game perfectly whilst you're playing it, it's almost as if the game itself was perfectly tailored to the music style, or vice versa. There is more music scheduled to be added that's by Hideki Nagamura himself, the guy that made the original music for Jet Set Radio.\n\nIssues\nThis is an early alpha game, and in some ways it really shows. The GUI, while nice in concept, feels rather jerky and unfitting, but this is a minor issue. The character colour-changing is a chore with the 360 controller, and I think a number of preset colours to use as well as the RGB sliders would go well. But the biggest and main issue is the optimisation. I have a rig that can run basically any game I want at Ultra settings and get 60fps, but I get less than thirty with high settings on this game. It's not a game-breaking issue, becuase putting it down to medium settings gets me 40fps which - with the game style - works fine. Putting it down to low settings get me around 50+ fps, but I prefer texture quality to fps personally. The developers of this game are very dedicated, and have stated that this is an issue they are working hard on to fix.\n\nConclusion\nNow, do you like skating games? Do you like freerunning games? Do you like AMAZING music? Do you like addictive gameplay? Do you like enjoyable maps and landscapes? If the answer is yes to these questions, get this game. Although you might want to wait until the game is further optimised before you buy it. (I personally don't find it too bad. It just takes some getting used to).\n\nThere's a few features on the game I haven't tried yet, so the review will be updated when I do.","April 6, 2015","true","33.1"," 21 of 26 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","21","26","0","0"

YES.\nDo you like Jumping? YES\nDo you like free running and parkour? HELL YEA\n\nKeep in mind this is an alpha game and there is still lots of bugs and glitches but the good overwhelms it\nThe map is quite small so you will fell like your going in circles and there isnt much story wise but WHO CARES THE PARKOUR IS FREAKING EPIC\n\nThis game provides a leveling system similar to other games. As you level you get points and you can use those points to increase stats in this case Speed, Jump and exeleration are you main one but theres more like Strenth. Its not too much of a chore getting to max level and there are a couple tricks to help you xp farm\n\nCurrently theres only three ways to level up Destroying anti video game propiganda, delivering gameballs and doing missions. And all of these methods involve free running and parkour.\n\nThe online mode is super fun speeding around with a friend is awesome but the online mode is where you'll find the most bugs\n\nConsidering This is an early access game is LOVE it and im 100% sure the map will become HUGE and the amount of thing to do will be overwhelming and Dev if your reading this please give this game a good story pleeeese\n\nOverall Hover: revolt of gamers is well worth your £15 or £12 honestly i say buy this game now before the price starts increasing.

If so; Do you remember the tutorial level, where once you beat the tutorial you could just run around that tiny sandbox, just enjoying going various different paths and thinking "I would love a whole game like this"\n\nI believe this game is that and more and even though it is nowhere near completion yet, what IS already there is enough to make me hopeful and excited for something beautiful.\n\nThis game is like the open world Mirrors Edge I've dreamed of, and even though only one area of the game is currently out and ready for you to explore at the time of this review, the city is massive, with many different levels for you to explore. The top of the city is a long way away from the bottom, you can imagine making one false move and falling down to the bottom of this city and being ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off. Thankfully the developers thought of this and provided a "rewind" button which allows you to move backwards to where you were a few seconds ago. This little feature helps to remove one of the main potential sources of fustration.\n\nAnd to make the parkour free-roaming deal even sweeter, one of the other inspirations is the Jet Set Radio Series, JSRF being one of my all time favourite games, it was what introduced me to this gem. Composer Hideki Naganuma, who's worked on some of JSR's most memorable tracks will have his music featured in this game eventually and I cannot wait for that day. Another clear inspirations is found with the rails, around the map there are rails that you can grind on to gain bonus speed and increase your stats for a brief window of time, allowing you to run faster, jump higher and traverse the environment better. I can only imagine this feature shines brightest in the multiplayer component.\n\nOh yea, that's right, on top of all of this, there is a multiplayer component to this game. In this open world other players can also be found, I'm not talking about AI controlled characters. I'm talking about actual human players. There is a scan function which allows you to find nearby objectives and search for important npcs and other human players. In my few hours of playing there has been some beautiful moment where I've met up with another player in the city, chatted for a bit and then ran around the city aimlessly for quite a bit of time, exploring the massive area together. I can only imagine playing this game with friends would make for a truely unique experience. But you aren't just limited to running around together, you can partake in minigames such as races or bringing item a to point b and the seamless integration of singleplayer components into multiplayer is something most games can only dream of managing this well.\n\nNow there are some drawbacks that can be attributed to early access:\nThe performance is not amazing, although the devs have said that a unity update will allow better perfomance in future updates\nNot all of the content is there: There aren't a massive amount of missions but there's enough to keep you entertained and the little things to do around the city will keep you occupied for a good while but aren't as fufilling as the main missions.\nSome of the missions can get really frustraiting at times.\n\nHonestly, most of my issues should be ironed out by release, but as it, this is already an extremely unique and fun experience to have alone, with strangers of with friends. I would recommend this game to anyone that was thinking of buying it.","December 29, 2015","true","22.9"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","85","11","13","2","2"

It takes me back to the days of me playing "Jet Set Radio: Future" on my uncles xbox in the living room. The Movement system is Fantastic (it could be better but im not complaining), with only some moderate cliping. I Havent done any missions, and ive just been roaming the city for 2 hours. Character customization is great, alowing players to build there characters around a Certain play style. Hoverheat is a mechanic some racing games implement, increasing performance at higher speads when continiously doing tricks, I feel like i'm in a Viper with endless amounts of nitrous. The Camera is questionible. Third person offers good movement/control but isnt as immersive as First person, however first person can get extreamly disorienting when you're doing backflips all day everyday. And then Auto, tries to get the best of both worlds but i just don't think that it can be executed properly. Switching to third when doing tricks, and switching to first when running or doing basic jumps. Id like to see annother cam, First person without all the flip rotation, A First person hybrid.

My HUD pulls up their Experience levels, 2 are max level (10) and the 3rd is a level 9, I'm level 8 not too far behind the others. They are all waiting for me at the start line waiting for me to scan into the race, I do it. The countdown meter begins 3.....2.....1.....We all begin to run, dashing through the neon flashing streets of Hover City, grinding on rails, flipping through traffic, leaping over pedestrians, human, alien, tentacle-man, robogirl, it didn't matter I had only one thing on my mind...to win. I grinded a rail to catch up to the level 9 that was zooming ahead of me, as i gain on her, I cartwheel over her to switch to another rail, and grind through the checkpoint. As i zoom past the lvl9 my HUD plays a sound cue....HoverHeat is activated. The bright blue neon lights on my character glow even brighter, the light trails following my shoes are even stronger, my grind speed gets even faster, I leap off of the rail and dash through Hover traffic leaving, dazed drivers and streaks of beautiful blue behind me. I have the two lvl10s in my sight fighting for 1st place...they had no clue I was coming. I peek at the top right of my HUD and it displays that there is only one checkpoint left, it was now or never. As i round a corner, right on the Red and Green light trails that the lvl10s left behind, a FlyBox manufactured HoverTruck is speeding towards me.."Is this it?" I think.\nNo.\nI slide mid-run, and begin to build up HoverHeat.."Cmoonnnnn" I beg as the Truck gets even closer. The Sound Cue plays, with a split second left,  I leap forward, over the FlyBox truck, and stylishly perform a trick, to maintain my HoverHeat. The lvl 10s had noticed me and look back, amazed with my near-death escape, in fact so amazed they don't see the other HoverTruck in front of them. The Truck knocks the two Veteran Gamers away in an instant and I quickly steal first place from the both of them and fly throught the  Final Checkpoint with the level9 10secs behind me.\nJay Wins, my HUD displays.\nIn the bottom right corner, a chatbox pulls up and displays a message from one of the lvl10s, Minimumu.\n"Great Race!" it reads.\nI am a Gamer, and I live to Level.","April 12, 2015","true","6.9"," 21 of 34 people (62%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","62","21","34","8","1"

It combines 2 fan favorites over the years, and mashes it up into a wonderful mix of Parkour and cyberpunk.\n\nThis game takes elements from Mirror's Edge and Jet Set Radio and puts it all together in one game. The basic premise of this game is that video games are banned in the city, and you and a rag-tag group of people are working together to bring video games back, and overpower the law. The story isn't really a big part of the game, the biggest part is finding different ways to complete the misssions you are given. The main mechanic of the game is being able to parkour and rewind. You are able to climb on buildings, do super jumps if timed right, and more. If you mess up while doing these actions, you can hold your rewind key and go back to the point you want to restart at.\n\nThe missions in the game as of now are pretty basic. Some examples;\n-Get from point A to point B in a certain time frame.\n-Run past security cameras while holding something\nEtc Etc\n\nI've attempted 3 missions so far (all I could find) and I've completed 3 of them.\n\nYou can customize your own player and take it online or offline. You then proceed to level up to a max level of 10. At random intervals, you gain skill points in which you can put towards your skill tree. In your skill tree, you can level up Jump, Speed, Acceleration, and more.\n\nThe online play is pretty solid. So far, i've seen 1 official server. Online is the same thing as offline. You can still complete missions and all, just doing it being online. The biggest server i've seen is 64 slots. The only problem that online has is that it drops your FPS a bit during play.\n\nKeep in mind that this game is still in very early alpha.\n\nThe performance of the game could be better, but devs have acknowledged this and are working to get it better.\n\n*Verdict*\n\nI love the main premise and idea of this game. The game is in very early alpha, so there isnt much content. But running around and smoothly finding ways to keep your streak going is fun in itself. The little missions that are already in the game are cool because it shows what potential it has to be implemented into different missions or even online races. I like this game for what it is. 20 bucks to me is a bit overpriced at the moment, I think 10-15 would've been a suitable price.\n\n8/10\n\n-1 for overpricing\n-1 for unoptimization.\n\nI do recommend this game.","April 8, 2015","true","4.5"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

That's gravity for you I guess. Still, upward angled rails and such would do wonders in making it easier.\n\nThe game has definitely been improved since I originally wrote this, however it's still not quite there. While the aesthetic is as striking as ever, I still can't get into it due to the floaty controls and level design.\n\nJSFR also had issues with its controls; the skating controls were very imprecise and floaty. However, it managed to overcome these limitations with intelligent use of directing rails. Indeed, the worst parts of those games were when you were actually skating around; the best levels were ones that you could lap almost exclusively by grinding, and that gave a much more enhanced sense of speed and control.\n\nI still can't recommend the game as a positive experience in its current form, but it's certainly an improvement. If you wish to support the developer, then it may be justifiable, but understand that this game is still far, far from what most would consider a "finished product".\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBelow this point, is the original review text.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis game plays like Jet Set Radio had a love child with Robot Roller-Derby Disco Dodgeball, and that love child were kidnapped by Mass Effect. It's very fun to run around and explore, and the races and gameball missions are pretty entertaining too.\n\nHowever, there are some major issues.\n\n1) The performance of the game is in the crapper; I couldn't pull more than ~28fps between an i5, a GTX760 and 12GB of DDR3 memory, in a game that is primarily cell-shaded polygons. Often, it dipped down to ~12fps\n\n2) The controls of the game defaulted to a french keyboard, which made no sense. The dialog is also a bit iffy, which tells me that perhaps the localisation needs some work. Further, the controls felt very floaty, making it hard to control the character while turning. This wasn't helped by the left and right actions changing the bearing of the player character, rather than strafing.\n\n3) The first-person FOV was capped at 90. For a game that moves this quickly, and that is this dependant on environmental awareness, I'd expect a minimum cap of 110.\n\n4) The tutorial was hard to understand (see point 2), and didn't explain a lot of the systems in the game.\n\n5) The level design needs to be tweaked a little, it was very easy to go down, and very hard to successfully go back up again. This meant I constantly kept finding myself in the same places, hampering exploration.\n\nAll in all, I wouldn't recommend this game as it stands. In the future, when it's a bit more polished, then maybe; It has a lot of potential, and I expect some of it to be realised. However, with this quality, this performance, and at this price point? Perhaps not.","May 4, 2015","false","1.7"," 15 of 27 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","15","27","0","1"

It totally is.\n\nDon't get me wrong here--- at the time of this review, the content feels very thin. There are only three music tracks that play on loop because the actual original score isn't finished yet. The customization options haven't been truly implemented yet. There are only two maps, and only one of them is built for some real free-flow parkour. The game can be buggy and sometimes the framerate drops to unplayable numbers.\n\nAnd yet this game is STILL amazing. For the very little amount of content this currently offers, it is a blast to play. Even when you've done all the quests and seen all there is to see, this game still has an unbridled replay value which players will find by simply roaming around the city. This is still in early access so I cannot blame them for the lack of content, especially because this game is supposedly programmed by only 3 people and some outside help, but the content that is present is tons of fun. Hover: ROG is as challenging and exhilarating as it is relaxing.\n\nThis game shows lots of promise. Don't wait, buy it now.

There are quite a few things to do, but don't hope for a big story arc, there isn't one - at least not yet. If you don't enjoy the movement on its own merits, you might find the game in its current state to be a little low on content. There is a big city to explore - but it is more a playground to move around in and less the huge collection of quests and missions you may expect from big-budget open world games.\n\nThe game is not optimized very well yet. If you don't have a powerful pc, you may run into performance problems. I currently (as of April 2015) get 30fps, sometimes dropping to 20fps on what was a high-end Laptop in 2009. The game is playable at that performance, but obviously a game with quick movement ideally is played at 60+fps.","April 7, 2015","true","2.6"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Look no further. However I advise purchasing Hover when it is on a sale, since I cannot reccomend paying $19.99 for an early access game is partially overpriced for what you are getting. On the other hand, the price of which Hover is at  goes towards the development team to improve the game further.<<<\n\n>>> If you are searching for a game that is finished and works perfectly without bugs, glitches and crashes, I suggest you don't purchase this game as it will be a waste of your steam wallet and your time. <<<\n\nHover : Revolt of Gamers is an early access game; this means that there will be bugs and glitches, the story wont be complete, it will be light on content. However, it means it will be improved. Every update will bring something new to the game, be it a new area of map to search or a bug fix. Steam may publicise this game as an early access game but it is in fact only in its alpha stage, meaning it has a long way to go before it will be complete.\n\nAnyone who has played Jet set radio and enjoyed it, I encourage you immensely to buy Hover : Revolt of Gamers as it is pretty much a modern descendant  to the game and will bring you lots of nostalgia from the\nHover is a mixture between Jet set radio and mirrors edge, you get the brilliant music amidst doing parkour in an open world (although at this stage, a small portion of a map that will begin to grow).\n\nThe only problem which will deter you from buying Hover is the optimisation. On low Graphics with a resolution of 800x640, my laptop (which has a Geforce GT 635m)  can get roughly 25-30 fps, on the reccommended default I can gather only 12-18 fps.  Also the default is set to a french keyboard- since it is a french game- but can be easily switched to other.\n\nOverall, I'd reccomend this game if you want something new to try, if you can handle the rough optimisation, I would definitley give this game a place on your steam library.  Furthermore it has full controller support and will have VR support in the near future, if you get motion sickness, I wouldn't use your VR headset for this game when it is fully compatible.\n\n-Littlegroover\n","August 16, 2015","true","17.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The new city is amazing. New missions, reworked missions, better optimization. More vibrant, more options in movement and what not. I have very few gripes. 9/10\n\nORIGINAL- At the moment, I recommend Hover, but at one's own risk. Since it's still early access, there's still some things that need to be worked out, and as such, I'll try to cover what I think are the most important problems, as well as notable high points. Note- this is a very long review. A TL:DR is at the bottom for convenience.\n\nThere are a lot of things good about Hover. It has the skating and tricks of Jet Set Radio, combined with the first person and beautiful atmposphere of Mirror's Edge, which is a great combination. First person is an awesome experience (there is also the default third person, and an "auto mode", where it's first person until certain tricks are done, switching to third person so people can keep their bearings, and then back), the music, while limited at the moment, is great, and the atmosphere and environment is amazing.  It's fun to just run around the city doing flips and tricks, and it's an easy time sink. Trying to do the side activities like jumping through the displays or collecting small clusters layered around the city is fun as well. A thing that I didn't like at first but grew to like was mission difficulty.\n\nAs you do more missions for people, the harder they become, and for the most part, there will be a lot of retries. However, once beating said missions, the payoff of experience, character skins, and general satisfaction outweigh how hard it was to get to that point. These missions of varying difficulty are mainly for anyone involved with the resistance; the main characters if you will. There are also repeatable missions for side characters, that you can do as many times as you like. These vary in difficulty across the board, so it's great for practicing different skills. The different mission types are currently races, variations of delivery type missions, and what I call Secubox fishing, where you try and lure Secuboxes (police tools meant to take delivery packages) into traps.\n\nThe main problem to me is progress saving. During my initial playthrough, I decided to play offline, to grow accustomed to the game. I gained about 4 levels of experience, at which point I decided to go online. While online, I gained about 2 more levels, and did a lot more missions, even gaining a character skin. Here is where the problem lies. Upon quitting, and then going back offline later in the day, my character had gone back to level 4, and all of the missions I had done while online I also had to redo. I don't know if this is is an intentional setting or not, but all that work I had done online was now for nothing, and I had to redo some of the harder missions in the game, which took long enough before.\n\nA second instance of this is after I unlocked the last character skin currently available, in which I decided to try it out. I decided to create a new character (called "gamer" in-game, probably should have mentioned that earlier) to use a different skin. After creating the new character, making sure I had selected a different character slot, I learned that for some reason, this new character was saved over the last one, meaning all of the progress I made on my original character was now last forever. While I plan on redoing all of the missions with the new character, it's still annoying to know that I can never go back to my original character when I don't want to do missions. This problem may be a one-off thing, but still decided to mention it nonethelss.\n\nBesides that, the other problems I see are fairly minor. It mainly has to do with the Secubox missions, where Secuboxes constantly get stuck on corners or dissapear entirely. There also seems to be instances where missions won't trigger unless you leave and come back a certain number of times (for me this only happens with Otello missions). As for suggestions, I feel as though tricks should be possible while carrying a packages.\n\n\nTL:DR- I would recommend the game, but be warned that your progress could vanish without notice, and there are other annoying bugs that aren't bad, but are still cumbersome. Probably wouldn't recommend making more than one character until the above mentioned bug is fixed (or looked into at least). As of 6/20/15, my score is 7/10.\n\nEdit 1 (6/21/15)- another addition that I think would be really handy is a map of some sort. It's very easy to get lost sometimes, or run around in circles, and I think some sort of map could have alleviate that.\n\nEdit 2 (6/24/15)- about the progess from online not transferring to offline, I believe that was a bug and a one-off thing. Haven't been online since so I'm not sure though. As for the saving over of a character, I found out that currently you can't have two characters with the same name, which is what I tried. Therefore, besides the minor complaints, there really isn't anything wrong. 8/10","June 20, 2015","true","63.4"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

It reminds me a lot of Jet Set Radio (which I absolutely love), which is a good thing. I've heard some people call Hover: Revolt of Gamers a spritual successor to Jet Set Radio, and I agree.\nBut enough rambling from me, let's talk about the game itself.\n\nThis game's presentation is nice, the environment is nice to look at, with it's vibrant colours and futuristic robo-look. Everything is very shiny and neon-y (is that a word? whatever...), which adds to the charm.\nThe music has little variation, but that is bound to change.\n\nThe gameplay is very fluent, it feels good to run around in the city and it feels great when you smoothly ninja your way across the city block. The freerunning can be disorienting at times, but you get used to it very quickly.\nThe content of the game (costumization, mission variaty, area diversity, etc.) not particularly reat, but since it is just in early access, I can't blame the game for this. As the devs have stated, the content will increase.\n\nTo sum this all up: I love this game.\nOf course it isn't done yet, but I still think that it has huge potential to be a classic.\n\nTo close up this review, some ideas for the game:\n- more character costumization (hairstyles, clothing (statbootsing or not), different tricks to equip)\n- (as mentioned above) add tricks, it would be really sweet\n- Add enemies to the game, to make certain areas dangerous\n- Add a guild/crew system, so friends (and strangers) can be a group\n- add personal/crew-graffity, graffity is cool and it gives the player identity (you can even have graffity wars or something)","April 8, 2015","true","4.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Its like Jetset Radio Plus Mirrors Edge. There are tons of racing Involved. Then you can level up your character With each level you can put Points into Speed Agility Sliding Grinding ETC. Over its alot of fun. But this is just My Opinion. i would Recommend this game as a Parkour Racing Type. (EDIT) Now that i have 36 Hours in this game.. i can say alot more. Its Very addicting. its just fun to Run around the Map jumping over buildings and running on walls. It has a kinda wierd mechanic where if you do tricks it raises your Energy. If you fail the trick you lose all of your energy.... And if you dont know You need Energy. if you have low energy your stats are decreased and if you have high energy... Well Vice Versia. Anyways, Its pretty fun...(READ THIS) Take note that ive been following this game since last year (This was posted 4/6/15) So just note that when you use my Review....

It's a game unto itself. It takes the grinding and openness of Jet Set and expands upon it, with unique characters, a good soundtrack in it's current state, and wonderful graphics. The gameplay is top notch, if a little flawed here and there, but even playing for a short time since the 0.3 update I've had a couple of really cool moments where I've pulled off some pretty awesome moves.

Well I should say "loved this game". The update brought a lot fo cool features to the game, but also a few flaws that to one who hasen't played the game wouldn't think to be much of an issue.\n\nPros: The game runs smoother than ever and is a stunning piece of art! The concept is such a cool idea, and makes the game even that more enjoyable.\n\nCONS!!!: The holograms that you use to be able to jump through and get full hover heat are now near impossible to get through, you have to hit them directly in the middle and no where else, otherwise you get lauched away and loose half of your current energy. The city is cool, but way to congested with rusted metal box building things in the lower part of the city, and the upper has way to many walls to run into. The city seems smaller, and there is almost no where to go to just run around and have fun. The police robots use to not come out unless you were on a mission, so if you wanted to just run around and explore the city, getting seen in the red spotlights wasnt that much of a deal, but now that the robots come out every time AND the scanners catch you faster now, you have to run from them as fast as you can get away, and if you slip up once you're pretty much caught. I have noticed some graphical issues that haven't been fixed when playing as Otello. Any part of him that glows (hands, feet, helmet, ETC) when at certain angles of the camera or character glow in stranged long lines that are about 4 times the width of said apendage going both directions, and it gets very annoying when it flashes on and off constantly.\n\n\nI do love this game, I just really want to see it be amazing again. Maybe find some way to spruce up the old city and connect it to the new one for all of those who liked the old one too.","August 15, 2015","true","9.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Hell no. If on the fence, do I think you should wait until the game becomes more stable and polished? Yes.\n\nHas massive potential with great mechanics and a colorful, large open world. Solid character customization and is a joy to play - when it works. A mission editor is also there that I have yet to try.\n\nWhere it goes wrong is the abysmal optimization. The game runs at a consistant 20 FPS - I was lucky to get 40 at one point. I personally feel that this is not fair to the consumer. If one's game is unstable to the point where there are constant problems - it shouldn't be sold as a $20 game. Crashing and glitches are also frequent. I've only played this for about 20 minutes and have experienced 3 crashes; refusing to play more.\n\nThe devs claim all of this will be fixed - and I'm sure it will be. If you are willing to wait a little to snatch the game 15% off, I'd say buy it.

There are three unlockable characters with unique abilities, and a fairly sized sandbox city to explore. What keeps me hooked for hours, however, is the online interactions with other players and the simple fact that the parkour is damned fun.\n\nThere's a real talented and dedicated trio working on this project, and they've been very helpful and conducive in the forums and community hub from what I've witnessed.\nEven if you aren't willing to buy the game in its current Alpha form, it's definitely worth keeping an eye on as it develops.","April 17, 2015","true","17.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It takes a lot from Mirror's Edge and Jet Set Radio in both gameplay and style. The soundtrack was composed by the same guy as from Jet Set Radio - Hideki Naganuma. Buy it now if you don't care about early access and minor bugs.\n\nLong review: Hover: Revolt of Gamers is a free-running/parkour open-world futuristic game. You play as a gamer, revolting against the anti-videogame movement set forward by your government. The game so far consists of a reasonably large city, which can be explored to most of its entirety and contains many different missions - races, time trials, delivery missions, etc. You are also able to create your own missions, of any type. The game also features an online mode, in which players may join in on races and other competitive game types.\n\nI would certainly recommend this game - yet keep in mind that it is still in early access, so if you want a full game, wait until this one is more developed/finished. However, if you are keen to get the game now, it is certainly worth your money. There are still bugs in the game, yet they are minor and barely interfere with your experience.\n\nThe concept of this game is beautiful; it holds an interestingly similar style and gameplay to both Jet Set Radio and  Mirror's Edge, yet is not anywhere near as constricted. Hover: Revolt of Gamers takes elements from Jet Set Radio (such as grinding) and from Mirror's Edge (such as wall-running) to create its own unique style. The music is also similar to Jet Set Radio - as the same music composer (Hideka Naganuma) has composed the sountrack to Hover.\n\nFor a team of three people, anyone should be blown away. It is a fun and gripping experience which shows huge potential as an early access game. My only gripe with it is the English - and that's saying something.","April 15, 2015","true","29.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The atmosphere combined with the amazing scenery and characters is wonderful.  It definitely has a good feel of Mirrors Edge and Jet Set Radio to it but that's not a bad thing.\n\nCharacter customization is pretty need with as much as you can change for now.  It's all color based and in groups but you won't have a hard time guessing where as there are 5 buttons that flash the area you're about to change color on.  Really hoping there will be far more character customization on the way soon!  Also a big plus to have the option to customize on the fly!\n\nOnly two issues I saw where that the game doesn't ask you what control type you want to use when starting up.  I had to go into options and click on Keyboard and Mouse to default it to WASD.  Prior to the change was a control scheme that was VERY different to me, using Z to move forward and running toward the camera.  The other is very minor, but the game does crash upon closing it.  There's also other minor issues such as grammar but for Early Access on an Alpha title, I'd expect that.  It's not like it's phone text speak bad and you can easily understand what they're saying.","August 10, 2015","true","0.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The parkour, though difficult to master, is ddefinitely responsive and intuitive, and brings back MUCH of the nostalgia from games such as Jet Set Radio Future. Though the music design is, to say the very least, lacking, the level design, character design, and gameplay, all make up for it. While this game is, as of 9/10/2015, NOT worth the 20$ price, containing only a single map, and very short gameplay which only hints at a future story, were it to be a full release (as it is only just in early access) that price is mindblowingly low. I highly recommend pursuing this game upon a full release, it will not disappoint.","September 10, 2015","true","9.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","1"

The fps (frames per secound) in this game is BAD at the time of posting this review the max level of frame rate is 20 and seeing as size of the city is HUGE then if you don't have a good pc and just a laptop like me the fram e rate will drop to about 13-15 regularly. Third-person mode isnt much better with the frame rate droping to 10 and 8 BUT if you can get past that the game is really good with VERY challenging missions at times witch test your skills you have learnt in the game and sometimes your navigational skills through the city.

In any way, shape or form.\nSecond off, I'm currently nerdgasming over this entire thing. This game feels like the lovechild of Jet Set Radio Future and Mirror's Edge, which are possibly the best two things you can ever combine.\n\nCharacter creation is pretty great. You start out with the 'starter' and the color sliders are a bit annoying to deal with, as you can't slide one without sliding the other, and it takes getting used to. You can also change the height of your character drastically, which is a feature I haven't seen on a lot of games like this, and a feature that is heartily welcomed. As you level up, you gain new characters. I believe you get all 4 avalible right now by level 6.\n\nGameplay-wise, it's glorious. Parkour, races, missions, all the greatest stuff. There are places where it is lacking, such as player-to-player interactions and variety in minigames, but so far in development, it exceeds all expectations.\n\nVisual-wise, it's a bit...glaring. Bright contrasting colors everywhere. It's okay if you can tolerate that sort of stuff, but it gives me a bit of a headache. The movement of the camera is glorious in 1st person, if a bit disorienting when you are doing flips and tricks. Auto is...strange, as it combines 1st and 3rd. 3rd person is great if your character is small. It'd be much better if the camera adjusted with the height of the character, but you win some and lose some. Movement is a tad disorienting and sickening if you aren't used to fast paced, spastic movements, but you get used to it quickly.\n\nAll in all, this game gets a 8/10 so far, and I'm sure once it is completed, it will be a 10/10.","April 22, 2015","true","6.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I loved Mirror's Edge, so this review might be biased, but for an Early Access, this game is already really, really nice.\n\nSo to starts off, this game has a character customization, which is already a plus point for me. At the moment, the character customization is pretty limited to only model, height, and color, but it's already nice for me, and pretty neatly done as well. Would really love to see another characters in the future, and also maybe individual items for each characters.\n\nSecond, the mechanics are simple, really simple, but does not discount the fun factor. You can be jumping here and there, sliding rails and backflipping such, scale the tallest building, with only movement keys, jump, and crouch. The simplicity is really nice for a game that can be made real complex.\n\nUnlike Mirror's Edge, the gravity and grabbing mechanics are much simpler. No fall damage, no complex landing, no fisticuff, no jump limitation, and no damage, which makes this a nice sandbox parkour game where you can jump around like hell just broke loose. It might be TOO simple, but it's real fun.\n\nThird, the mission. There's only a few missions currently, but it's already pretty fun. You can have races and basketball. The 2 mode is already pretty fun, and as time goes, more modes will be added and it'll be even more fun i bet. For the time being, the game modes is pretty fun already.\n\nFinally, the environtment. The map is the best. Really large, really colorful, and really vibrant. You won't get bored looking around in this game. The only problem was that you can easily get lost. It's so large, that you'd probably forget where you came from and where you're going. A map or a minimap would be nice.\n\nWould totally recommend this, and would totally play along until it's out of Alpha.","April 9, 2015","true","9.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Has wonderful parkour elements a city that is your playground and solid multiplayer. I get around 30-50 fps and I have a nvidia 660 with i7 quad core processor and I have to run it on low since this game does have some bad optimization issues right now(They are planning to fix on a later date). I highly recommend this game because you can make these sweet combinations and moments and if you mess up trying to make those cool moments you can just rewind time to fix your mistakes. There are also some times on the missions where it isnt challenging at all like scoring gameballs (Think of them like soccer balls with the goal all the way in a different location). The devs should consider making enemies frequently spawn in to make it just a bit more exciting.","April 9, 2015","true","4.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Styllistically to me it feels like a cell shaded Space Channel Five that was on a collision course with Jet Set Radio. The world is absolutely amazing, but the alpha feels a little on the lifeless side, as a good portion of it is taped off with "not available in alpha" signs.

It is an alpha though so, it is to be expected. I have right around the minimum spec as of right now and it is a tad unplayable. I get about 25 fps on average with my laptop overclocked (because it actually requires a decent amount of CPU power). I'll test on my desktop when I actually go home (I'm at my girlfriend's place). Specs are: AMD A8 (quad) overclocked to 2.6 GHz, 8 GB of DDR3, and an 6750m (which is pretty close to the 4800 series in raw performance). If you are having performance problems do not play in first person as it will be disorienting due to the low frame rate! I could definitely play the game chugging along at about 25 fps in third person, but I'll probably just see how my desktop holds up or hold off until the performance is improved.\n\nAs for the game itself. The game looks solid thus far. It feels pretty fluid. The scale of the alpha seems to be a bit small but that is also to be expected. There isn't much music yet, still waiting on Naganuma music. The minigames are a bit basic from what I've seen, just races and throwing "gamerballs" into boxes. Haven't taken it online yet, but I assume the game will be more fun with human competitors.\n\nThough I was slightly disappointed with performance, the game is coming along nicely and I'm looking forward to each update!

I love the games it references and the films that it draws inspriration from. It is open world and the world is a vibrant mix of colours and aliens. The only problemb is, for me personaly, is the fps drop when I was overlooking the city but hopefully that will be fixed as they said in the tittle screen (mabye).\nWhat I would add to the game is:\nA better camera, the camera is trywing to be realistic which is all good. However, in parkour games E.G. Mirrors Edge or Dying light they have gone for a more stable camera which IMHO adds some control (and more satifaction) to the long flows of freerunning.\nSed flows would also be benifited from a more detailed tutorial I.E. Telling you the controles and some "combo" moves that could be applied to this game to make a better one.\nI apreciate that the game is still in the dev stage and think that it is a great idea.

Content is still early, polish is nonexistent, and performance is atrocious despite the game not being that spectacular looking. I'm struggling to maintain 30fps on low with a GTX 760. It's too early in the early access phase to be anything more than a purchase for future reference. Hover has cool ideas, and the base mechanics seem pretty solid, but it's worlds away from being complete and just doesn't offer anything compelling yet. If you want to actually play the game, wait a year or two. At that point, I think and hope it will be an easy recommend.","May 19, 2015","false","0.6"," 6 of 14 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","6","14","0","0"

I may or may not have written about this game before. If I have, I'm here to speak with a wiser mind of it.\n\nThis game would be better off as a Windows exclusive.\n\nThe gameplay is great, up until Ver 3.0 (Which I didn't get to play for reasons I will cover in the next paragraph) and felt like you really needed to use your parkour skills.\n\nUnfortunately a good part of freerunning is being able to see what's in front of you which is rather frankly hard to do when everything looks like you walked into a rave party hungover and teary-eyed. Merely looking at a trashcan felt like the paparazzi were out for a celebrity shot of you and the suit was no exception. 3rd person view was inhospitable which I could actually live with seeing as I prefer First Person. When I talked to Midgar Studios, however, then came the kicker.\n\nOriginally posted by Midgar Studio:No sorry, an APU is not powerful enough to run an advanced 3d game, it can run games like LoL but not more.\nExcuse me!? This game looks like Jet Set Radio which had to run on a GPU with a 1600 x 1200 max resolution with 24-bit color and a 100 Mhz clock rate and it can't run on something with approximately 16 times that clockrate among other things? And it can run League of Legends too, as they clearly stated. OK, I'll reiterate my POV and what I've just said. This game is great but it'd be better if it was Windows exclusive or at least optimized. As for what I just said? A game that looks like Jet Set Radio, which came out over a decade ago, can't run on a system that exceeds the tech specs of the time. You created something that resembles a game that could run on a machine that had to use low-poly graphics (Sonic Adventure is still a thing) that looked rather hideous which forced Sega to create a game with minimal focus on looking good and managed to make it fail to run on anything short of a high-end GPU? That... This game is great gameplay wise but to fail to make it run without causing eye damage on a laptop takes a special kind of failure. I've tried to be as professional as I could about this but the offense is just too great. If you find yourself with a laptop or computer, not enough cash to buy another one, a Dreamcast (or Dreamcast emulator) and a copy or ROM of Jet Set Radio, power up the Dreamcast/emulator, and boot up Jet Set Radio. Trust me, you won't have missed a single thing. I'm sorry it had to end this way, I really am, but it did.","August 9, 2015","false","10.2"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

And I would love to play more of it when its more developed.\nWhat I found from playing\n\nPros:\n+Characters have their own unique Perk\n+It feels nice to run around and explore\n+You can deploy missions with other people and compete in races against eachother\n+UI is relatively nice and simple\n\nCons:\n-You can only play as one character starting out, everyone else is locked and you need to do missions to unlock them.\n-The colors of the game aren't that attractive in most places. It's not as bright and lively looking as I expected.\n-There's no enemies in the game, and nothing that hurts you.\n-No health bar, and no fall damage.\n-Only one shout box, no private chat, no chat bubbles\n-You can draw graffiti, but there's only 1 and it's the game logo.\n-The NPCs are zombies, just walking in a loop forever.\n-Not enough story. There's a few things you can examine that make it obvious the world is living under a dictaorship. But it's written waaay to bluntly. It should be more suttle imo.\n-No Minimap or game map. Navigation is horrible, and only a couple landmarks that are memorable.\n-Needs more level ups and more indepth skill leveling.\n\nIn it's current state, I wouldn't reccomend it unless it went on sale.

It's a drag because the game is in NO WAY optimized. Even on my machine running all on High, it looks like utter garbage from a PS2 game emulator....\nThe Mods also ban anyone arbitrarily from the forums, so you can't really go in and talk to any one if one of them is having a bad day, i wish there was a review board for discussion moderators who act like jerks... However for me, it's enough to say no thanks, I'd rather play something else that doesn't look, feel, and act terrible.\n\nThe game might be ok, but the management sucks. If you want to keep an open dialogue and active forum account make sure you never say anything negative.\n\nOh btw this is the only forum i've gotten a ban on in my years and years of using steam. Seriously.... I don't know any way to make this sound positive because i haven't experienced even a slight amount of customer service from this supposed studio.\n\nIn reality Midgar Studios is a 3 man team of people from France who can't even speak english, let alone be bothered to interact with people who have paid them to make this game which is already 2 quarters overdue and was supposed to be out of beta by now. Really, just can't say enough bad things about this game and company.\n\nOh and the game runs really poorly for a lot of people. Don't expect too much, it still needs a ton of work, wait for it to come out of EA for sure!\n1. Poor optimization\n2. Poor game music\n3. Poor game options\n4. Poor graphic design\n5. Decent gameplay, when it's not bogged down by optimization problems.\n6. Poor communication with  the Devs\n7.

It feels barren of life, just a hub of some of the same missions over and over again, and it's really not fun to run around places. I just don't see the appeal.

It teaches you the controls (Which are easy to catch) and sets you free to a sizable city to explore. From there you can A:Run around grabbing 'Game Spheres' and delivering them to drop off points or B:Do races or more game sphere throwing in a competitive way. The game is fun while it's new but as you learn the map and see yourself replaying missions it becomes boring. The online mode of the game is mostly functional with only occasional dissconnections(At the time of writing this, that will probably change as more people come in).

Past that, however, the game feels amazing to control and the environment is perfect for messing around in; had the performance not been so inconsistent, I'd probably be playing with the current version for hours. The character creation shows some potential, and the game feels almost perfectly like what it sets out to be: a merging of Mirror's Edge and Jet Set Radio Future with the fluent controls and techniques of the former and the colorful fast-paced action and good music of the latter. So long as the devs stay committed to this project, I think this'll turn out to be pretty damn good.","April 10, 2015","true","1.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It teaches you the controls (Which are easy to catch) and sets you free to a sizable city to explore. From there you can A:Run around grabbing 'Game Spheres' and delivering them to drop off points or B:Do races or more game sphere throwing in a competitive way. The game is fun while it's new but as you learn the map and see yourself replaying missions it becomes boring.

It's a game within itself, though it may seem inspired off of Sega's work it is indeed its own entity with different mechanics and a unique feel to it all together, and yet so familiar. Less of a review and more of a few ticks on what to add on possibly to the developers:\n\nCharacter Customization: I LOVE what you guys have as is, however there can be so much more. Say for instance the starting character, possibly different hood styles (one with ears, or a zipper, etc) that could be unlocked with level. Hair styles for Greendy, etc.\n\nHangout: much like the garage from JSRF, a small open area as a hub for players to mingle and practice skills without fear of the police hunting them down.\n\nMore districts: I noticed you guys were working on more areas and that's fantastic, keep up that work! the more we can explore the better.\n\nCharacters: Perhaps adding more as you go along, very fun and quite a few as is but having even more would be amazing!\n\nOver all, this game is fun, great to play whenever you feel. The music is incredible, the elegant yet simplistic style of the environment and each detail beautiful, no hastfully thrown together models involving clipping and such. I look forward to playing this a LOT more, I may even record it for my channel, we'll see!\n\n7/10, for an Alpha that's pretty amazing, and i KNOW you guys will thrust this game into the future and it WILL shine bright!","December 25, 2015","true","18.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Not really much story at the moment but that seems like it will be fixed, because yet again, this is an alpha. The only downside for me is that it isn't very well optimised at the moment. I have a fairly average PC and it runs at 20-30 fps at best even on low settings. I know other people say this about this game, but this game is essentially the lovechild of Mirror's Edge and Jet Set Radio Future.\nTL;DR- It's good.","May 6","true","31.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
