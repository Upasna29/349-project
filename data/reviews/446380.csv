REALLY scary.  Fantastic atmosphere, both visually and aurally...very tense...but is it LOGICAL?!\n\nFirstly, there's the usual "you've been given a really, really super-dangerous job for next-to-no pay" premise...so in spite of them never clearly stating as such, I'm assuming that all of these post-FNAF games are set in third world countries, where life is cheap and you'd basically murder your grandmother for spare change.  I mean, I accepted the premise of the first Five Nights at Freddy's as much as anyone, but the sixtieth time around this kind of set-up is pushing its luck just a tad, don't ya think?\n\nSecondly, I do everything the game tells me to.  Run here to stop generator A, B, C, or D from running down, solve (admittedly well-done) mini-puzzles at the laptop when required, and try my best to hang around in the designated "safe-spot" for the rest of the time (quite how the laptop knows the exact place in the house to stand to avoid ghostly victimisation I have no fricking idea, but I'm happy enough to accept that I know ♥♥♥♥-all about modern technological capabilities).  And STILL I die, again and again and again.  I don't know WHY I do, but I do.  There's a bit in the game's instructions which says something about Sophie occasionally attacking because she simply "doesn't like you".  Well, apparently she ♥♥♥♥ing HATED ME, because she assailed me left, right, and centre.  No reprieve.  No logic.  Just sudden, random, rampant doom.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I actually quite liked this one.  There's something at least slightly more assured about it than the likes of, say, Emily Wants to Play.  But I'm getting a bit sick of this recent run of horror games where sheer, dumb-arsed LUCK seems to play such a large part in how long you survive before the next fatal "jump-scare" comes your way.  I'm sure a plethora of fan-boys and fan-girls will slap up guides in no time, telling me what you have to do at each and every different hour and blah-blah-blah, but unless I can actually work this ♥♥♥♥ out for myself, it's not exactly LOGICAL, is it now?\n\nI honestly look forward to all you people proving me wrong, at which point I'll revise this review and the below-given rating.  Please, tell me how my faculties are flawed, and by that I don't mean write ♥♥♥♥ like "dude, everyone knows that 11pm is the time when Sophie attacks you if you hang around too long at generator C", because unless the game clearly tells me this, IT ISN'T LOGICAL.  Please, thumb me down and tell me I'm wrong, but also tell me WHY I'm wrong.  Hell, even the first FNAF plays reasonably fair for at least the first few nights, but this game gave me almost no delusion of "control" over my fate whatsoever.\n\nI've played a LOT of horror games in my time.  And almost all the "old" ones - I'm even talking up to Outlast and Alien: Isolation here! - give you sufficient indication of what you have to do to survive, then the rest is up to you.  This super-recent, post-FNAF breed of game seems to believe that "♥♥♥♥ happens" can pass for good game design.  I beg to differ.  Having said all this, I think the dev of this game shows tremendous potential, he just needs to emulate a better - nay, FAIRER - kind of game in future.\n\nThis is far from the worst of its species, but it's also not the best, and until someone (including Scott Cawthon himself) makes a game as good as Freddy's the first, we really should just put a cork in all games of this type for the time being, whad'ya say?  (Or failing that, ♥♥♥♥wits like me could just stop buying them, haha.)  Looking forward to that veritable assault of "tips" from all you super-savvy fan-persons out there...\n\nVerdict: 6.5/10.\n\nUPDATE: Well, here we are a bit over a month later, and credit where credit is due...this dev has laboured long and hard to give the gaming public a much improved experience.  And, I'm pleased to say, he's MOSTLY succeeded.  We now have two difficulty levels - though the easier of the two is still much too hard in my humble opinion - and while the "random" death element has been ostensibly removed, and "cheap" deaths are far less common, I still can't help but feel that there are moments when you're damned-if-you-do-and-damned-if-you-don't, and I certainly still feel that save-points are too few and far between (once every hour would be more than challenging enough, especially for the allegedly "easy" version of the game).  Whichever way you look at it, I'm happy to concede that this is by far one of the best games of its type - i.e. the some-strategy/some-luck/jumpscare-game-with-minimal-mechanics sub-genre - though it would appear that the first Five Nights at Freddy's is destined to remain the king of its kind.  As with that game, however, I'm probably destined to never find the nerve and/or patience to fully "beat" this one, but in light of the dev's improvements I'm more than happy to adjust my rating to read (drum roll, please):\n\nREVISED VERDICT: 7.5/10.\n\nSECOND UPDATE: Well, I gotta hand it to Eddie the dev...after the initial doubts of myself and many other reviewers, he's worked long and hard at this little game of his, and he's finally managed to make it fair to the point where even the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ likes of yours truly can now complete the darned thing (granted, on the easiest difficulty)! I'm now willing to go on record and state that this is, in my opinion, a rival for the second-best game of its type, after the first Five Nights at Freddy's. Congrats, sir, and I hope you get some kind of Dev of the Year award for this commendable effort. ♥♥♥♥ing good game...finally.\n\nRE-REVISED VERDICT: 9/10 (by far the biggest score hike I've given a game...EVER).","March 18","true","6.2"," 22 of 28 people (79%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","79","22","28","6","6"

It makes it kind of original.\nPros:\n- Great monster.\n- Nice Graphics.\n- The game is meticulous about objectives etc. and does provide helpful tutorials.\n- Generally nice premise and quite scary with some heavy jumpscares and a good atmosphere.\n\nCons:\n- It's simplicity is nice, but it's a bit too simple. I get that it costs so cheap, but I would like to see some expansion on the content even if it means an increase in price. Let me put it like this: The game has a solid foundation, but not really that much on it. I wish the developer would play, experiment and expand on some features of the game like Sophie for example. She is only used for jumpscares (she does try new tactics later on), but my point is, the developer can do a bit more with her. He can probably add a few gamemodes as well\n- The game doesn't really have that much cons, which is great, but the game could do with a bit more story and context as well, but this point could be entirely optional.\nI could go on for hours about pros and cons about the game.\n\nI would give this game a 7/10. I was going to go with 6/10, but then I just thought about what this game would become later and I just sticked with 7, hell it might even become an 8 later on. Also the game does improve as the hours progress.

To me it has a good level of immersion over games like FNAF while maintaining a similar concept.\n\nI felt the tension and the anxiety especially as the clock grew closer to the checkpoints, but what I didn't feel was purpose or intrigue.\n\nIt seems like a challenge game.  "Can you beat it?," is the question it asks you.  If you like to conquer things then this game is for you.  To me games are something to explore but beyond the first hour I don't see what this game has to offer people like me.\n\nGames like FNAF keep your interest by offering new challenges as it progresses but this game just seems to become more difficult without changing.  Is that bad?  No, certainly not but it just doesn't hit me as a customer.\n\nUp your narative, vary your gameplay, and offer me something to figure out and I'd be happy to try out another one of your games, TrerPlay.

The game features a similar gameplay as Five Nights at Freddy's 4, but MUCH more challenging! I'm working on my video of the game right now, but I can tell you that I had to stop playing the game eventually because my heart was beating WAY too fast! This game is NOT to be taken lightly! My one complaint would be how Sophie just chooses when she wants to jump at you whenever she pleases, with no mistakes from the player necessary. In the in-game guide, it does say that Sophie may just not like you, and decide to kill you anyway, but it is very very rare. Unfortunately, it was as if the guide was written on opposite day, as where it is very very rare to make it to 10:00 PM before she just says "eh, whatever" and just kills you off. If you enjoyed playing Emily Wants To Play or any of the Five Nights at Freddy's games, or just horror as a video game genre, then you will easily find this game worth a try!","April 1","true","1.0"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

Some people are disappointed with that but, personally, I don't see what joy there is to be gained from failing for absolutely no reason, especially in a title where the action is spread relatively thin in the early stages.\n\nThe 'jumpscare simulator' will never be a favourite sub-genre for me but, with the issues addressed, this is about as solid an example of one as you can hope to find on Steam.\n\n=======================================================\nOriginal Review\nSorry to be the lone voice of dissent here but... no. Not while we're rating this as an actual playable game.\n\nThe premise is simple enough. You've got four lights to keep on, two upstairs and two downstairs, while avoiding the titular ghoul Sophie who will sneak, scuttle and slither around behind you at all times, looking for the perfect moment to grab your face and howl at it with a decibel count to rival most mid-40's war artillery.\n\nThe problem is that there's no rhyme or reason as to when she can murder you and when she can't. You're assigned a safe point at the start of the game that changes around between checkpoints but it's about as much use as nipples on a tank. By the developer's own admission, and I quote:\n\n"If Sophie doesn’t like you she might kill you randomly but this is very very rare, I hope she likes you!"\n\nExcept it's really not that rare. In fact, it's the most common way you'll die. At what point has randomised death ever been acceptable? Imagine trotting through Super Mario Bros and just bloody dying of an aneurysm. Imagine fighting Dr. Wily in Mega Man and spontaneously combusting because he just 'doesn't like you'. It's even more tedious here, in a game where you spend the majority of your time sitting around waiting for the clock to roll over a two hour increment while the lights slowly dwindle, daring you to expose yourself out of boredom rather than necessity.\n\nIt works as an app that you can leave running in the background to scare the ♥♥♥♥ out of you at completely random intervals, maybe like those maze games that walloped Linda Blair's demon face from The Exorcist at you with an ear-splitting shriek as a surprise bowel evacuator. Nothing more.\n\nHere's what I got out of it:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwS3aUuZlqY","March 21","true","0.8"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","33"

After the first few checkpoints, things got more frustrating because I didn't get one part of the game: what to do whenever the gurgling-like sound would happen. I would stop and not look around, I would keep cranking, all those things and Sophie would still get me. But I still finished it and would definitely recommend this game. One thing I would add is the option to see Henry's notes after you checked them before. Maybe a menu option to see notes the player has already gathered, or something like that. Just to see story as a whole after one has completed the game/checkpoint because I know I may have skipped one or two.\nCheck out my channel or this playlist to see it for yourself! 9/10, would recommend.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLucQ3P8DHvktQy6b93BdfEDlNHHdKh410","May 20","true","2.3"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","1"

There's a lot of tension and getting ready for a jumpscare and the jumpscare itself is good.  However, I found myself walking through the game up to 12am and only lost because the I was using the computer when the system crashed and within a split second of the scren going down Sophie jumped me from zone A and never stood a chance.  Second jumpscare was when I went downstairs and immediately got jumpscared as she was standing over by B.  I'm now all the way up to 2:30am but only played 40 minutes of the game.  I'm not sure if the game gets harder or not but it seems like the win/lose is based on random luck being caught out by mechanics like above which I have no chance of avoiding.  The youtubers made this look and feel harder than it actually is though I read that there has been some work on the game probably since they played it.  I also have a bit of trouble identifying where to click.  While there is a tutorial at the start I wasn't sure if I could flick the camera to turn or to just click there and where was clickable if I could.\n\nI had another go and got to just after 3am and once again the instant the system started shutting down I got jumpscared.  The only times I'm getting jumpscared is when I literally can't avoid it so on the one hand it's super easy but on the other it's annoyingly difficult and frustrating.  One problem I have with the mechanics (though not a bug) is this;  When the power goes down you go to wind them up but as the night goes on the system crashes more and more.  Provided that you can get through the crashes the system literally reboots itself for you and this looks to happen more and more frequently meaning it's more the challenge of surviving the crashes and making sure none of the lights go out.\n\nI can tell the game is getting harder but within an hour of playing I feel like I'm going to beat this game too easily and the only way I won't is jumpscares I have no way of avoiding.  This game has lots of potential buti it has some issues which I hope I've given constructive feedback on and hope it helps make a better game.  Can't say whether to recommend this game or not it's hard to say....I can't submit otherwise so I'd say...no but for people to watch this space and wait for the issues to be ironed out.  All the best, there definitely potential here.

(Like a pu$$y)\n\nBack to the main topic\nThe plot of the game is; you accepted the job of taking care of a old man, making sure he's fine while he's asleep and check if he needs something in the night.\n\nBut there's the thing, the house is old, and it doesent have electricity by itself, thankfully the guy who requested the job, had the great idea of making tiny machines that can make electricity\n\nIt should be ok then?... RIGHT?!\n\nWell, turns out since the machine its still a prototype, and its not flawless...\nThe machines can malfunction, and you have to turn them back on, you can make that, by going to a laptop and solving the *puzzle* (As seen in the trailer)\n\nThere's 4 machines (Or Checkpoints)  in total  A,B,C,D. 2 on the first floor and other ones in the second floor.\nYou have to make sure they always have some power to function and make sure they dont crash while dark...\n\nTL;DR The game owns some really good mechanics, and i highly recommend it, its scary and it can last some time before you can actually learn the mechanics, plus its helping this new developer, soo he can make more games, and even better!.\n\nIf you want to check another project of this developer, search for  Grey Night  (Which sadly was cancelled for the lack of support and time)","March 16","true","1.2"," 8 of 16 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","8","16","2","0"

Every 2 hours there is a checkpoint saving your progress as you go onto each 2 hour interval. The only form of electricity are four small hand-cranked devices that you spin to keep the battery from running out, occasionally the machines fail and have to be restarted via the laptop in the kitchen. All the while something isnt right with the house, an angry spirit for reasons unknown wants your booty and you have to keep the lights on and stay in the designated "safe zone" whenever possible to avoid getting your booty torn open by said spirit.\n\nThe game itself\n\nVery terrifying, I wont compare it to other games because truly it is unique in its own right. It is a mixture of 1st person and point and click mechanics which works very well for what you are trying to do in the game.  The controls are very simple and easy to adjust to.\n\nHow is it terrifying? If the "Dead ghost girl" horror cliche doesnt spook you, the flickering lights, dark atmosphere and insanely horrifying ambiance this game has to offer will. It is quite possibly one of the scarriest games I have come across, the only downside is it relies alot on jumpscares and loud noises to set the atmosphere, but that can be overlooked in this case.\n\nI would recommend this to anyone who enjoys a good scare and doesnt mind a few interesting puzzles, and micromanaging through the terror. Very good game and I cant wait to see what the creator does in the future, good luck and goodnight everyone!\n\nEDIT: In future updates I would love to see new gamemodes, maybe even a difficulty setting, new enemies ect, and please please PLEASE add an options menu to adjust the resolution, graphics and audio.","March 17","true","0.8"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

The lights in this house are powered by a crank that needs to be manually turned to re-generate as they loose power over time, or are interfered with by Sophie.\n\nWhile it uses FnaF like mechanics I really enjoy that you "walk" around the house to different rooms, rather than being in a single room. It is not open roaming like Emily wants to play but instead clicking areas on the screen makes you walk to different rooms.\n\nYou only have to survive a single night but the night is divided into sections of 2 hours. Each 2 hours you survive will save that checkpoint to continue from.\n\nYour Job is to ensure that the lamps keep staying bright by manual turning the handles on their generators to replenish their power. There is 4 lights, 2 downstairs and 2 upstairs, with 1 randomly being chosen to the be a "savepoint" when thinks get hairy.\n\nAs you progress through the night things get more frantic with each checkpoint with lamps not only loosing power but starting to fail completely needing you to use your laptop in the kitchen to re-activate them and solve additional tasks to do so.\n\nListen out for queues to know when to stop powering lights, run away from Sophie when she comes for you and hope she likes you :)\n\nThe developer did add a guide with a few tips here:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=647150959\n\nI enjoyed my first attempt playing this game very much as you can see below and I'm looking forward to more.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dFcU8ErsQE","March 21","true","0.4"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

As the nurse, you must take care of an elder who just recently purchased a new house. This new house being the one Sophie haunts. To survive, you must manually keep the light sources active by exploring the house to crank the generators individually.\n\nBackstory\nSophie was a young and average teenage girl with a great GPA. But out of nowhere, she went missing.\n\nGameplay\nNot the best graphics, but that doesn't really matter. The concept is pretty nice. It differs from what seems to be similar to the FNaF franchise according to the community's responses. The AI of Sophie isn't bugged or anything. The game carries in a lot of scares. Through and through, the game is pretty well done.\n\nPros\n- Spooky\n- Challenging\n\nCons\n- Long nights\n\nThrough and through, I'd recommend this game to people who are interested in horror games.","April 23","true","0.5"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

The atmosphere is very dark and it has a great sense of urgency and fear of the unknown. At first, I thought the scenary was a little too dark, but this actually proved to be perfect as it gave that feeling of dread.\n\nI love how it's interactive: You have the choice of surviving.\n\nI love the mechanics and atmosphere.\n\nThere is only one thing I would say to make this game better, and that is to include more sound cues to make the feel or horror even stronger. Perhaps some footsteps...spooky laughter...glass shattering..\n\nWith all of this being said, I love this game and I even took the pleasure of making a let's play for your game in hopes that it may get the recognition it deserves.\n\nHear it is.

Also when winding the generators if u hear a nasty sound behind u stop right away and be ready to move elsewhere back to the safe area.\n\nI have played a short time with this game but i really enjoy it thus far, the jump scares are heart attack causing, though i am not sure yet how to avoid the jump scares, its kinda like fnaf 4 meets emily wants to play. I have tried to figure out how to avoid sophie but she gets me everytime whether i stay at one point or keep running constantly, but finally it seems a guide has been put out by the maker of then game which explains some things, ssuch as there being a safe point where u are fine for a short time, but you need to check the laptop for that safge point, and do not turn around if she makes a creepy noise near you, do not use the stairs too much, and also keep the power on, though i have sucked at all of those up to now. it is a great game if you want to be scared as long as u are using your headphones, beware the scares are pretty dang loud and in your face.\ncheck out my video of it here\n\nhttps://youtu.be/DazqhWE-8q8","March 16","true","1.2"," 4 of 11 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","4","11","0","0"
