"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dragnix/recommended/439440/","Dragnix","{FITH}™Dragnix","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dragnix/","743 products in account","This key was obtained from the publisher for the purposes of review.\n\nTarget Audience:    Top-Down Shooter fans who want something different, but are willing to deal with repetition.\n\nVideo Review:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70ro79ago5E\n\nSummary:\nThis is a sale target in my mind. It gets a recommend because it's worth picking up at some point, as the base gameplay has enough of an alteration in the top-down shooter genre to be worth something. The fact that your core can be attacked by yourself and the fact that enemies take you down in one hit, that's a nice change of pace for the genre, and does make it stand out a bit. The animation and art is great, even with characters like PewdiePie making an apperance. But where the game majorly suffers is variety: it's the same thing very, very quickly, and doesn't have the lasting power to keep your entertained over a long haul. The unlocks do small things to help, but enemy and arena variety would have gone a long way to help the game out: and it fails at it. And it doesn't help that the online play is ancient: this is 2016 and you're asking for IP host/join in game, with Steam as your base platform? Not a good move. In the end, I'd wait for a sale regardless, as while I had fun, I can't say that you're going to get your moneys worth at this current price, but eventually, you will.\n\nLists:\nPositives:\nBase gameplay is good. Solid controls, and some good powerups that can cause chaos.\nDying to one hit while the core doesn't means you can't just throw yourself in front of enemies; you've got to consider your own life, and the risks you take.\nLike the fact that you can hit the carrot core in question. Makes skill shots around it mean something.\nGood gameplay options in the options menu. If you hate yourself, turn on the weak carrot mode.\nCan cause good chaos in the coop battle, reviving your friends while running for your life.\nA good soundtrack......\nNegatives:\nVariety lacks. The game falls into a pattern that causes a bit of a problem over the long term: the main gameplay is the same variation of enemies and items over and over again, with not a lot to spice it up. After an hour of gameplay, you've seen the base content here.\nIt's 2016. If your game is host/joining via IP when Steam is the framework.....you're probably doing something wrong.\nAt the bloody difficulty, that's where the game starts seeing some problems in frame rate when you've got a lot on screen.\nThe Soundtrack really isn't used that well. You'll be hearing the same base music over and over again unless you go and change it yourself.\nMultiplayer games are very very basic.\nVisual effects don't really help for me. It's artificial in terms of value added.\n","March 25","true","3.1"," 11 of 18 people (61%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","61","11","18","4","0"

It might have an audience, hell some might say I just have a poor taste in games for this review but heres some object and subjective\nPros:\nCheap, only Eight dollars (or whatever price it is in your country)\nPick up and play!  You don't have to worry about any background or tutorials.\n\nMixed:\nSoundtrack.  I like the Acheivements music and the rest to me is meh or crap.  I really dislike the main song as it's just really high pitch and poor at conveying any action\n\nGraphics: some of them are really detailed and nice for pizel art, but others (Namely that stupid dna place's exterior for example) are so simple and kind of boring to look at.\n\nLocked at 60fps, making a 144hz monitor owner cry from neglect somewhere.\n\nCons:\nPoor options;\nNo Resolution controls.  Even Slender a pretty incomplete game on the same engine (Unity) had this.\nNo Fullscreen option (Meaning no options between Windowed, Fullscreen/Borderless Windowed, and Fullscreened)       This is unexceptable considering that I am pretty sure that Unity has built in Windowed and Fullscreened modes.\nYou can ONLY switch between controller and Keyboard  THERE ARE NO MOUSE CONTROLS WHAT THE HELL IS THIS THE 1980's OR DOS OR SOME BS?!?\nAlso on this last point, guess what, IT WASNT LIKE THAT BEFORE!!!  The game was originally submitted for the Ludum Dare challenge with admittedly worse graphics but mouse controls making it feel a lot better.  But somwhere between that version and the Itchio beta versions it was changed to GAMEPAD AND KEYBOARD only.\n\nAnd you know about that Gamepad/Keyboard only thing?  All the prompts seem to be controller only in game!  Thats right I get muted out of doing damage and guess what It shows to rotate the right stick!  WHAT RIGHT STICK GAME???????  WHERE ON A  KEYBOARD IS A RIGHT ANALOG STICK?!\n\nSuper repetetive gameplay, playing on single player made me prefer paint drying simulator now with doritos™ wall drying action.\n\nAnd it's main thing is multiplayer which for a indie game is kind of suicide\nEspecially when said multiplayer is p2p or maybe local multiplayer only...  (Would be difficult on most setups unless you have one made for couch gaming)\n\n\nAdvertises Full controller support while seemingly no support for button prompts other than xbox controllers and none for a single dpad controller like a nes controllers. though honestly dont know why you'd try to play a twinstick with a controller like that.\n\n\nSome others might think of my complaints as small, and that's fine but I value a pc game having good settings, proper control rebinding and other features that ARE SUPPORTED BY THE MOTHER ♥♥♥♥ING ENGINE USE IT!!!!!!!!","March 30","false","2.7"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Simple to start with a difficulty that ramps up with a lovely snowball momentum.

Absolutely\n* Is it worth the money at this stage of the game? Nope...Only if there ware any passable levels and/or dedicated multiplayer servers and/or more enviroments to play on, but sadly it lacks all of those.\nI do recommend the game.I did have fun playing these 4 hours and after future updates I am sure that Of Carrots And Blood is gonna be worth well over 7.99$ !","March 27","true","4.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I haven't been able to play beyond single player, but I feel like there should be a description stating that if you want to enjoy at least 75% of the game, you need to have a buddy who also has it. A lot of the game modes are locked out of single player. The items in the game are fairly limited, perhaps each character has different items they can equip? I am not sure. I am in the process of creating a new character in-game but it takes time (or at least thats what the Dr. said, no idea).\n\nI really wish there was some type of campaign mode, but it seems nonexistant. IF you play single player, expect to play the same one over and over, no other stages. Just 1. Now it is fun, at the time of this review, I got about 2 1/2 hours in the game.

Quake 2 online still works, Civ4 online still works, Heroes of Might and Magic 2 online still works and these games are over 20 years old!\n\nI understand that a small dev team might not have the expertise to bring decent online to a game, its complicated and a million little things can bugger it up. Their is no easy solution or fix and most PC users will just download Hamachi to fix these issues but Hamachi is no longer free.\n\nSo now I have to pay to bandaid the problem with the game I also paid for? How about no. Risk of Rain had this exact same problem. Direct IP connections are just not going to work for the majority of people.\n\nMultiplayer aside, how is the game? Well its a twin stick shooter with a giant object in the middle that i/we need to protect but can also accidently shoot due to friendly f-- no.\n\nI don't want to believe it, twin stick shooters are the simplist form of enjoyable gameplay around. You don't even need to go out of your way to make a twin stick shooter game enjoyable, by its very nature its enjoyable so I am truly amazed that they ♥♥♥♥ed it up.\n\nFriendly fire is always a pain in the ♥♥♥ in any game but it can enhance the gameplay when done right. Not doing it right however is a thing you are doing when you have us on a escort mission and we can kill the person we are escorting! In a frantic, monsters from all sides type of game, we are going to suicide, a lot!\n\nI dunno, the graphics, voice work, music and presentation really sell the game but the actual gameplay and the non working online make this game a tragedy.\n\nI had no expectations going in except that of course the game will be great. Twin stick shooters by their very nature are great and also featuring online? Sign me the ♥♥♥♥ up! But the online part is a lie and the gameplay is ♥♥♥♥ed up in a way that could be easily fixed and so this game comes so close, so close to being great but the first wave of buyers will be like me.\nBurned by the whole experience and leaving negative reviews and unless the game is patched, fast, it will be a huge shame because genuine care and love seemingly went into this game only for no one to check if the handbrake was on before parking the car of the top of the hill that is steam front page.\n\nJoin Grumpy reviews for all your gaming needs\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/grumpyreviews","March 25","false","0.2"," 5 of 14 people (36%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","36","5","14","0","0"

OK, read on.\n\nThe art direction is fantastic with crisp, animated sprites, and the overworld reminds me a lot of the kind found in Super Mario Bros. 3.  The overworld essentially functions as the game's main menu, which is a cool integration of features and gameplay.\n\nThe meat of the game is the arena-style defense and deathmatch modes.  As such, the amount of fun you have with the game is likely proportional to how many friends you have playing with you.  Even in a failed mission, currency is saved so you can continue to make upgrades to your arsenal: unlocking more characters and equippable items during combat.\n\nThe game gets hectic very quickly, making for fast rounds whether you're playing with friends or against them.  But because the game delivers a lot of party-like elements in its gameplay, the amount of time and value you'll get out of the game is once again partially reliant on whether you have 3 friends to play with.\n\nThe only snag I've found so far is accidentally kissing my friend when playing 2-player co-op mode (I know that sounds ridiculous).  Sometimes I'm scrambling to clear the screen and end up accidentally running into my friend's character, where we end up locked in a kissing animation for a brief moment.  Luckily the kissing mechanic does play a useful role, which you can discover in the item shop.\n\nOverall, the game delivers lots of intense shooting action.  The controls are a breeze to pick up and you'll get the hang of it in no time.  It's a great game for short play sessions, but it could also work as an amazing drinking game with a few buddies.  It's weird and funny and an all-around fun experience, and if you enjoy games of this genre you'll likely be charmed by the graphics and gameplay.\n\n","March 31","true","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Its a Dating Game.\nThe main purpose of the game is to kill every enemy that tries to eat your precious Carrot, but watch out since they can eat you also.\n\nAfter killing monsters, you can spend your "DNA" that you pickup from fallen monsters to buy shop items and get new skins. Like Pewds, wtf he's here???\n\nAnd...\nThats it. I have bro to play with but with that kissing mechanics makes me feel like... ew.\n\nSolo. Don`t buy it. There`s nothing to do but play a repetitive 1 only survival game and gain skins. You will worn out just about minutes.\nAnd why there`s lack of variation. It just looks the same. Only 1 areas. Similar environment.\n\nMultiplayer. Hamachi might work.\nOnline, how to do it? Its a classic way to give port ip but you need to Port-Forward to make it work, else it refuse to allow incoming player to join. Like myself, didn`t work at all. This need to be something, like Multiplayer server list.\n\nGreat Soundtrack? I don`t see why it was great though, cause its a looping soundtrack and its forgettable.\n\nI know people might be thinking I'm being negative, but Co-Op seems fun though. Solo isn`t.\n6/10","April 8","true","1.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
