Eight hours and 24 achievements later, I have to say I was pleasantly surprised.\n\nBionic Heart isn't the best visual novel I've ever played, there are certainly issues that prevent it from being more, but it has a charm that I wasn't expecting.  The game's greatest strength is in the sheer number of choices you're given and the many branching narratives that result.  Discovering them all and winding your way through different story paths is truly where the fun lies.\n\nOur story takes place in the 22nd century, in a world that through some catastrophic event is perpetually shrouded in clouds and endless rain.  The protagonist, Luke Black, works for a biogenetics company in London.  It is this association that leads him to a fateful encounter with a bionic human, a meeting that will forever change his life.\n\nOK, so it's sci-fi and a little hokey, but that's part of the charm.  Some of the ideas are pretty interesting, such as the endless rain, foam meals (because real food is too rare and expensive) and Mars colony that I wish we could have seen more of. Other ideas are rather silly, but if you can shut off the part of your brain that scrutinizes everything for realism, the game is fun and easy to get into.\n\nThe artwork is polished and quite good compared to a lot of other English language visual novels.  It's a bit refreshing to see a game that clearly isn't trying to pull off the manga/anime look and stands on its own.  The character designs are detailed and interesting. And outside of a few backgrounds being a bit more sketchy than polished, the whole look comes together very nicely.\n\nThis visual novel has full voice acting, which is a big deal for a lot of people.  I usually play with the voices on mute for this type of game, so I can't comment on it much other than what little I actually listened to before turning it off was pretty....bad.  I know Winter Wolves doesn't have the development funds to pay for high profile voice actors, but the B-movie quality of voice work here really takes away from the game, and that's saying something as the game's premise is pretty much a B-movie.\n\nMy biggest gripe, though, is that the writing could have been a little more polished.  Some of the endings had glaring typos, and the writing style was more casual in places than I felt it should be.  I know this is probably a silly nitpick, but everyone calling each other by their first names, even people who have never met each other, drives me up the wall. Luke referring to his boss as Richard instead of Mr. Meier or just Richard Meier (and this is a guy who only met his boss maybe once before) just seemed so out of place and awkward, it kept pulling me out of the story.\n\nDespite some of the issues, I really enjoyed Bionic Heart. I was lucky and picked it up in a bundle, but for what's here I feel the $10 price point is fair.  Fortunately, there is a demo available if you want to try it out before taking the plunge.  I'll definitely be purchasing Bionic Heart 2 when it's released.  If it's anywhere as fun as this one, I'm definitely in.","September 22, 2014","true","7.8"," 107 of 119 people (90%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","90","107","119","4","10"

At a certain point, I simply skipped all the previously read dialogue just  to get to the choices. All-in-all, it was a rather dull experience.\n\nThe personalities of the characters are flat, and easily predictable. The plot was often cheesy, and sometimes the reactions of the characters made no sense. The 'relationship meter' of the character only influences the game in very rare instances. For example, if you get to certain points, characters you have a great relationship to will still betray you/treat you like dirt if the plot demands it. There's only seven plot-relevant characters, the rest of the world doesn't even feature.\n\nThe sexual innuendo was especially painful. You are often forced to suffer through all sorts of sentences how 'hot and amazing' some girl's body is or our main hero commenting how he wants someone badly. it came across as a bit immature.\n\nThe voicing was... alright. The female protagonist was voiced by someone with either a bad mic or its an intentional effect to make her sound inhuman. Some others just sound really bad. The music has really strange cues and often ruins the mood. Not to spoil the story, but a tense scene where some people are about to die is suddenly overlaid with 80s porn music because they confess their love to each other. It was like a fist to the nose, mood-wise.\n\nIn the end, I didn't care for the characters, nor for the story. It was a bland, featureless experience. Alright to pass time, if you take it during a Sale, but don't expect to spend more than 6 hours on it.\n\nWinter Wolves has the tendency to spit out Visual Novels like mass produced, pre-packaged goods. Check out their other games, judge for yourselves. As someone who often played and enjoyed Visual novels, I can warn you that this one  is in the lower tier. Albeit I applaud the effort they made to voice the characters. That is about all that stands out positively. I was sadly fooled by the number of positive reviews in comparison to the bad ones.","November 7, 2014","false","6.5"," 30 of 36 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","30","36","0","0"

I was tempted to give it a miss altogether. However I tried it out and ended up really enjoying it.\n- choices are a bit more broad than I expected, not only can you choose different dialogue options but you can also choose where to go to or to avoid certain locations\n- getting to an ending only takes around an hour, but surprisingly if you go back and take a different path a completely different kind of story can unfold\n\nhttp://youtu.be/fRX6viF_SrI\nhttp://youtu.be/aTvH76MqHws\nSo I actually achieved three different endings. First I gave the robot away to the police, that made the game end very early on, and it was kind of lame.\n-----But then I started again and avoided notifying the authorities. This time the story went for much longer. Choosing between your love for your girlfriend or the robot was a prominent theme. At the end of that play-through the bad guy was apprehended, the police conveniently let the robot go, nobodies heart was broken and everybody basically lived happily ever after. It was a bit too sweet for me (okay it gave me a nice warm feeling inside lol). This ending gave me new information about the mysterious robotic woman but only enough so that it actually created more unanswered questions.\n-----At this stage I had more time to play, so i went back again. I actually didn't really find more out about the robotic woman's background. In fact most of the main characters that took part in the story in my second play-through were put aside and didn't feature at all once I got to about mid-story. The game took place in a completely different location with a couple of new characters instead. There wasn't really any romance this time at all, it was more Sci-fi with a touch of horror. Some scenes were the same but it was overall quite a different experience.\n\nObviously the game is very simply presented with still inanimate backgrounds and characters. But I liked how the game looked visually. The only problem I had with the game’s visuals was that occasionally you could see more of the character images than you should have. What I mean by this is that sometimes they are raised above the bottom of the screen and you can see that they are cut off where they should have legs. It wasn't a big deal but it was sort of an immersion breaker.\n-----All the dialogue is voice acted. I thought the protagonist’s dialogue was done adequately. Some of the characters spoke a bit slowly and monotonously. It seemed like they weren't as good, perhaps because it was the same voice actor attempting to create different sounding voices for a variety of character. That didn’t really matter though. I really liked the voice of the protagonist's girlfriend, she sounded really convincing when she was angry.\n\nOkay so I recommend trying this game out. There is actually a demo version. If you check out the community hub you will find information about acquiring that there. You might want to take a look at it before purchasing the full game. I found only three in endings in about two hours time. But the game allegedly has twenty-four alternate endings in total. Hopefully this means that for the $10 price there is enough unique content to satisfy people.\n\nClick here for my YouTube gaming channel","August 13, 2014","true","5.0"," 41 of 57 people (72%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","72","41","57","2","0"

Maybe that is an exaggeration, but man, it really isn't good at all.\nThe sad thing is, I believe the developer(s) really actually cared about this game. It has a sense of personalization to it that comes from a loving hand when crafting. I just don't think they had the chops when it comes to story writing and as I mentioned before, that voice acting.\nThe graphics themselves do look quite nice however, so that is a positive to be taken from all this.\nIDK, maybe one day when I am in that 3AM B Movie sort of mood, I will re download this game and try it out again, but it is unlikely. It's a game I really want to like, but just cant.\nAs of now though, I really cant recommend this game at all.","December 7, 2014","false","0.9"," 30 of 42 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","30","42","0","2"

The game is fully voiced but the voice acting is so poor you will probably wish it wasn't. 24 different endings, certain ones reveal more of the plot and other ones change things about characters so they couldn't have the same continuity. There are a lot of choices but the game is so short that you will basically make a few decisions which will set towards a certain set of endings, you will then get 2-4 other choices each leading to a unique ending. I managed to get all the endings in the game in under two hours. The main character doesn't even seem to like his best friend and girlfriend very much so at least I wasn't alone in not liking characters.","September 28, 2015","false","3.9"," 23 of 30 people (77%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","77","23","30","3","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kiwimango/recommended/314200/","kiwimango","kiwimango","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kiwimango/","1963 products in account","I really dislike the dialogue and character interactions. Unfortunately, that is 90% of the content in a visual novel, so I unenjoyed this Visual Novel pretty thoroughly. I also find the protagonist to be creepy, and some of the things that he says are just perverted, perfidious and unloyal (he is engaged), or out-of-character, and it made me uncomfortable to play as him.\n\nThe protagonist's best friend (Tom) seems to have the worst lines out of anyone. At one point Tom says "With whom you were speaking?", and all of his lines felt very unnatural. The protagonist also seems to only be tolerating Tom, so it doesn't make sense how this person is still the protagonist's best friend.\n\nSPOILERS below!!!!!\n\nIn the first five minutes of the game you are given a choice; Let a threatening female android into your home, or call the police. If you call the police, the game gives you a "bad end" and you are told that the android "might have been your perfect partner." It then goes on to say that you live on with your Fiance, have kids, and basically live happily ever after. Which doesn't sound so bad to me, tbh.\n\nThe alternative choice is to let her in. In this Visual Novel the protagonist isn't really a "blank slate" for the player to fill in, he has his own personality and life. This is important to note, because letting in the female android doesn't fit his character. Once she comes in, he sees that she is an android missing half of her face, and then she runs off to hide somewhere in his apartment. Here's the weird part: The protagonist then tells Tom (who was in the other room) that he is sleepy so Tom will leave and the protagonist can be alone with this android. Why in the world would he do that!? This android was just threatening to break down his door, and she's missing half of her face! Being alone with that android is the last thing that anyone would choose to do!\n\nThose are just a couple of examples of character interaction and choices that I found inappropriate. Also, the protagonist creeps me out! He's been engaged to a woman for 10 years, yet just about as soon as this android forces her way into his apartment, he's inner-monologuing about wanting to sleep with her. Even though she is still an immediate threat to him, and is openly threatening to kill him!\n\nI can not recommend this game, to anyone.","December 6, 2014","false","1.7"," 21 of 28 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","21","28","0","0"

It is set in the future. A robot escapes its facility and flees to a top programmer at Nanotech. The novel has 24 different endings, each one gives a Steam achievement.\n\n\nGraphics:\nThe graphics are nicely done, but for me and other people I talked to there are too few artworks for the characters, meaning the only take so few positions during the game. The backgrounds are fitting, but mostly not a really spectacular sight. The artist however is not to blame since the setting of the game doesn't play in beautiful places but in a - dsytopian or just realistic? - future.\n\nSound:\nThe music is nicely done, an only downpoint is that - if you go on a certain path first - you get minorly spoilered about one character by noticing the voice also is robotic while the protagonists don't seem to notice it yet. Since you have to go a very specific way this is a minor issue, but there still could have been "normal" human voices to the bionic robotic protagonists since nobody in-universe seems to notice them by their voices.\n\nStory:\nThe story reminds me very much of "The Outer Limits". There are all kinds of endings - some depressing, some uplifting, good and bad, and a spectrum in-between. Many times, several protagonists' fates remain unresolved, but by replaying the game one can sometimes get an idea of what happens to them.\nThere are two or three logic flaws in the game, noticeable when you replay. For example in one scene something happens which if you take another choice doesn't happen, although the people involved in making it happen shouldn't act differently at all.\n\nControls:\nDue to engine limitations, it seems not possible to bring up the pause menu if you play with a controller, but as it is a visual novel, a controller is not superior to a mouse anyway. I just feel like this should be mentioned. There also seems to be no way to visit previous scenes, so one should save often.\n\nRecommended:\nIf you like either visual novels or science fiction, you are right here, even more so if you liked The Outer Limits. An asking price between 5 and 10 Euro feels right for this game.","August 20, 2014","true","7.7"," 23 of 32 people (72%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","72","23","32","0","3"

What's the corporation he's working for is hiding? What's happening with Tom, his best friend?\n\nThe game is focusing on Luke's life and depending on your choice, you'll meet a different fate. From never meeting Tanya to being kidnapped/killed without forgetting also all the other endings (like staying with Helen or marrying Tanya), you'll have to choose wisely if you want to unlock an ending you want. Some of them are easy while others are quite a ride.\n\nAnyway, at least, with this visual novel, I had finally (like with Hatoful Boyfriend that I've played after)  real different paths. While with Always Remember Me, it was a focus on relationships - with the same routine, here's it's different. Yes, relationships are important but ultimately, it's not always them deciding on your fate.\n\nI love the realistic graphics, I found them really nice, however, you can see the fan service there: girls with few clothes, nice curves, very good voice actings.

It took me a while (a little over 10 hours, I think, although I paused a lot) to finish the game and get all the achievements but now that I have, I'd like to give my thoughts on it.\n\nI was pleasantly surprised to find myself liking it despite that I'm not the target audience for this game.  Based on the artwork and the fanservice, I believe Bionic Heart is geared more towards the male audience.  However, unlike certain other such games out there, Bionic Heart actually tells a story, and I always find story to be the most important element in a visual novel.  I liked the whole sci-fi environment and the possible ethical question that can be raised.  As some may be able to guess based on the game's title, the question of creating bionic beings (artificial human beings) is addressed.  There is clearly a villain although he masks his true intentions well to the point that most of the police in the city of future London (where the game takes place) are bribed to keep things quiet.  Also, I like that there are 24 endings so there's definitely a lot of replayability to get them all and without a walkthrough, it would take some time.\n\nOf course, this game isn't without its flaws.  The writing does seem a bit awkward at times and could have been polished more.  Although I was pleasantly surprised that there was voice acting (most of the VNs I play don't have it), there were a few points where there were errors such as the voice not speaking on a certain line or the same line being repeated twice.  These are minor points, though.  I can't say if the voices fit well with the characters although I did find most of the female voices to be annoying.\n\nOverall, though, I did enjoy this game, being a fan of visual novels and all.  Now that I know what Bionic Heart is like, I'm going to try out Bionic Heart 2 and see whether I'll like it as much.","May 9, 2015","true","10.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I like the art, but it is not a typical anime art style, so some may not enjoy it. The game is fairly cheap, and should not be compared to that of a Japanese visual novel; Japanese visual novels are generally longer and at least four times the price of what this game is (I've been to Japan so the high price isn't due importing). If you keep that in mind then this game is pretty good.\nCompared to other EVNs, this game is fairly long; there are 24 different endings, which some are caused just by changing one decision.\nThe plot is set in the future, and you play as Luke, who is dating a lady named Helen, and Tanya, who is a human looking robot, shows up on Luke's door. Tanya is curently on the run, so Luke hides her at his apartment. The story just involves how Lue's life gets really complicated.

You are in a future version of London where it is always raining, the leadership of the world did this to the planet, and now everyone has to suffer for it. You have a long time girl friend, Helen, and your best friend, Tom, in your life, but is there room for one more, very mysterious person named Tanya. This story does get up into the PG-13 realm, so its not for everyone.\n\nGraphically you are looking and very well drawn characters of anime-ish feel. All the different rooms, or areas that you will be interacting with are static images, but definitely give you a specific feeling, for example your workspace at your job is very sterile looking, it makes it appear as if this is a place that you are forced to go so that you can live the life you are living. There's also the virtual park, which is filled with bright colors and reminds people of what it was like before the constant rain was falling from the sky.\n\nThe voice work that was done for the game fits. All the characters have that emotion to thier voice. You can feel the anger, the sadness, the frustration, etc.\n\nThe controls in the game are very straightforward, as this is a choose your own adventure type of game you will be click on the choices, or locations that you would like to go. Remember every decision could change everything about the game.\n\nSo you are a guy named Luke, and as I stated before this is the type of situation where there are multiple endings. Now of course there is the perfect ending, and part of me would really like to see what that has in store for me, but I'm okay with the couple of endings that I have so far uncovered. Ther are definitely twists and turns in this game. There's betrayal, there's emotional turmoil, and there's plenty of love and hate emotions flying around. There's also a like meter that changes based off of certain choices you make in the game with certain characters. Now of course this also causes a change in the story, but I think its pretty obvious that that would happen.\n\nI really wish I could say more about the story, but the fact of the matter is that I've witness how different the story can go. So I have to say that if you are looking for something intriguing that won't take too long to get through, but definitely has its PG-13-esque steamy moments, and drama, you might want to check this thing out. I personally found that after the first time through I definitely flew through the dialogue I had already heard, but once I got to the chance to branch off I was back in the story until I got to whatever end I was headed for. So for this experience I'm going to give it an 8.5 out of 10.","October 9, 2014","true","2.1"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

Bionic Heart was an exception to this. Though the story wasn't overly deep, I was left feeling like most of my choices mattered and was interested enough to play through for all 24 endings. If you aren't concerned about achieving multiple endings, you can completely play through the story in a single session.\n\nThe basic story involves a human-looking robot escaping a secret lab and seeking help from a talented engineer. You play the role of the engineer and are faced with decisions about love, life and work. I could go into more detail, but that would defeat the point of recommending the game. I will say one of the hardest endings for me to reach was marrying the robot!\n\nAs with most visual novels the interface consisted of a background image, a close up image of whoever you were talking to, and text options. Occasionally you have to chose locations from a map interface as well. The backgrounds and art were average, nothing memorable.\n\nParents, and those who are concerned, the closest to nudity they had was the standard pose of a woman in her underwear covering her breasts.\n\nThe interface was well done with more than enough save slots as well as the ability to fast forward or rewind. This made it easy to work towards full completion. My only complaint with respect to the interface is the scenes which required clicking a certain sequence of options. This did not enhance the story and made replaying those scenes annoying. Lastly it had a wall of endings so you could easily keep track of what endings you reached.\n\nThe game is fully voice acted, but I played without the volume so I cannot comment on that. I read much faster than they speak, so I didn't have the patience to listen. What I heard in the beginning it sounded fine, but other reviews have complained about the quality.\n\nIf you have a couple hours to kill and want a decent story where your choices seem to matter I recommend buying this game on sale.","April 13, 2015","true","5.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The acting is painfully bad and only emphasizes the awkward, unnatural sound of the dialogue.

It kind of ruins the pacing to have, e.g., "Killed by Julia" pop up in the Steam overlay right before it happens.\n\nThere's also a recurring issue with sprites zooming in from above/floating in midair so it's obvious they're cut off mid-thigh.

While most visual novels do have a tendency to focus on romance, this one is no different-- but at least it also has a strong action/mystery/science fiction story to go along with it.  The westernized art is well done. I also very much appreciate the fact there is voice acting for 100% of the dialogue. That is something that takes a lot of effort, even though it leaves me with one complaint: I do wish that they hadn't felt the need to voice-act the main protagonist's inner thoughts and feelings. During conversations and interactions with others, it's fine, but otherwise it sounds a bit awkward for the protag to literally be talking to himself. But, that's a very minor complaint everything considered.\n\nI also love just how many multiple endings (both good and bad) there are in this game, many of them vastly different from one another. It makes you feel like you are part of a futuristic Choose Your Own Adventure. Unlike some visual novels on steam, your choices are plentiful and have a direct impact on what going on and which direction the story takes; making it a highly interactive experience. With interesting characters, an evolving storyline with varying paths, and lots of replay value, this is a fantastic choice for those curious and/or apprehensive about the visual novel genre just as much as it is for those who already enjoy them.","February 24, 2015","true","4.7"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

I only got a quarter of the available endings (in just under four hours), and don't think I will try for any more.\n\nThis is a tough one to review. I enjoyed this title much more than Heileen and Heileen 2. Partly because of the sci-fi nature, but partly because this game seems a bit more polished than those titles.\n\nMore polished but all out fantastic either. The voice acting isn't great (better than Heileen 2), but not so bad I felt I had to turn it off. The music is decent enough, when present. The art is alright, the screen caps and videos on the store page accurately represent it.\n\nIf you're looking for a visual novel to spend an evening with, or kill some time between work, this is a decent enough way to do it, though I would recommend grabbing it on sale if possible. If you are a completionist and intend to get all 24 endings, then it might be worth paying the full price for this title.","March 4, 2015","true","3.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The story itself is decent and I love how many endings there are. You can tell the developer actually took time with that part of the game. Considering this is a Western made Visual Novel I am impressed with the branching paths. I've played Eroge and Normal Japanese VN with way less choices then this. You really feel like you have some control over what's going on. I believe this game originally didn't have voice acting and they added it possibly so it would be more welcomed on Steam. Bad choice and a waste of money. Play with the voices off and I'm certain you will be happy with your purchase. Get it on a discount if you aren't entirely sure.","March 19, 2015","true","6.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The 24 different endings branch out on various occasions where your choices actually matter, which I found enjoyable, even if the choices in itself are rather dull. The voice acting is bad, but not awful. It has something like a trashy C-movie flair, so if you can enjoy a Schwarzenegger movie, you can also enjoy Bionic Hearts.\n\nThe story itself is dull, but kind of pleasing. At least it kept me interested for the 2 hours that I needed to get all the endings, so it did the trick.\nThe only thing I really think is bad is the art. The faces and bodies in Bionic Heart are all a bit off-shape, you always get the expression the chin or the hips or something else are at the wrong place. There are times when the game wants to be "sexy"...but get's rather horrying in the process. So if you play for the ♥♥♥♥, better play something else.","March 25, 2015","true","2.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

You can tell when a different microphone was used for the recorded voices.\n-Some plot holes\n-Typos in the written narration\n-Very short\n-Flat Characters\n-The ending was abrupt/rushed/anti-climactic\n\n\nIf you like these sort of games, go for it if you can get it on sale or in a bundle, otherwise there are much better out there for 10 dollars (pretty high)","December 19, 2014","false","1.1"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"
