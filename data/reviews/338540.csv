This game is fun, its very easy to pick up and its interface is fairly user friendly. Its tutorial could be a bit more in depth, but all in all if your looking to enjoy a game for a few hours and it is free this is a good way to go. I say a few hours and I dont recommend this game because thats all it takes to get from tier 1 to 4 in the ships... then at tier 4 is where the problems begin and i mean serious problems. Like world of tanks this game uses a tier system for ships with relatively weak ships at low tier and strong ships at high tier, At tier 4 you will start to see tier 9 to 11 ships, this basically ends the game. These ships have double your hp, do double your damage and have double your view range. Prepare to be destroyed over and over again.\n\nAs this game has a small community 95% of games will be like this, every so often you get a rare gem of same tier ships in a game and for me this simple but engaging game is great at times like that. But having to work your way thru game after game of no contest destruction by ships much higher level is tedious at best. This then brings me onto the second problem with this game, and for me the more important issue. The people in the tier 9 to 11 ships, the games veterans. There is two sides to this and I can see both, there appears to be very few people reach these high tiers so without being placed in games against low tiers they would never be able to play these top tier monsters. But this has the knock on affect of no one will reach high tier because of what i said above.\n\nThe other side is the attitude of these veterans, they are toxic and rude people. If you dare to point out the inbalance of this matchmaking their attitude is disgusting, and so I am sad to say that for once a game is ruined by the people who play it. They are rude, offer no assistance and generally a nasty group of people. So let them have their high tiers thats fine, and hopefully people will read this and heed my warning to not play this game, so eventually they'll  be left with a ghost game and maybe then they'll see the consquences of there actions.\n\nIn short a decent fun game thats easy to play. But awful matchmaking and TOXIC COMMUNITY VETERANS.\n\n\n\nUPDATE FOR IN RESPONSE TO STYLER27\n\nStyler27 how am I an angry ragequitter, I clearly state on multiple occasions the game is good it just has flaws. I dont understand your aggression towards a player who has played the game at entry level as everyone has to and had a torrid time, To help clarify as well my WR is 51%, so it has nothing to do with what I won and what I lost it was my experience while playing. Pay to Win doen't bother me either I never even mentioned that system in my review. Finally Styler27 just to make it abundantly clear in my 20 hours I reached Tier 6 destroyer, tier 5 Cruiser, Tier 6 Battleship, Tier 5 Heavy Cruiser and Tier 5 Aircraft Carrier. So yes I did experience the game, and anyone who has read our little exchange can see what the NF2 community is like, you represent them perfectly. I have offered constructive and objective criticism, I have even expressed areas I enjoyed. Then you wade in with your personal attack, NF2 community please welcome Styler27 to prove us all wrong. Thank you styler27.","March 21, 2015","false","26.9"," 591 of 663 people (89%) found this review helpful 42 people found this review funny","89","591","663","42","14"

I have 3 level 50+ captains in NF2 so ignore what steam says about me not playing for very long.\n\nI'll try to be as in-depth but at the same time I'll give you the straight truth on what's going on with this game...\n\nBox art description: Navy Field is a game about WW2 naval battles where you choose a nation, decide which ship line to go down, then play out sea warfare in glorius 2006-era graphics. Where the game lacks in graphics, it makes up for in strategic combat that can actually be quite thrilling if you're into this sort of game.\n\n\nTHE GRIND:Now let me get this out of the way first: This will be the make or break the game for most of you out there.\n\nThere is a term for what this game puts you through and that term is "Grind". This game will require days of your life in order for you to play ANY ship beyond Tier VII. There are 11 tiers.\n\nThe good news is that the first 6 tiers are fairly easy to get to by playing normally without any sort of booster or Premium(More on this later). The better news is you can get to every single ship class by Tier IV so you can try all different playstyles before you uninstall this game because of the crazy grind to Tier X.\n\nTHE P2W:All in all, this game is only truly about 20%15% Pay to Win. There are no "Premium Ships" in NF2 (unlike NF1), and there are no Premium Weapons or Premium Planes or anything. Every ship/item in the game must be earned with XP from battles.\n\nThe P2W currency in this game is "Gold". With Gold you can buy  "Premium", which is like a subscription and does a few 'subscriber'-like things. The main reason anyone would buy premium would be for the Credit and XP boost that comes along with it, a whopping 50% boost. ... Not the most P2W I've ever seen by far but maybe that's why it's so cheap.\n\nI've paid for Premium before, and battles where I'd average 800 xp I'd be getting about 1200 xp so there's a decent boost from it.  But the main advantage of Premium is that it unlocks extra officer slots you wouldn't normally have. This is a huge advantage and if you want to take advantage of this you could pay for a single day of Premium and this permanently unlocks the slots. EDIT: After further review, it appears as though these slots are unlocked by default. Which means I would change the amount of P2W this game is down to about 15% from 20%.\n\nBut either way, that's the most pay to win aspect of this game. There are a few other things, such as items for your ship you can buy that will give you a 15% boost to your engine recharge speed or for 1000 gold (roughly $10) you can straight up buy 100,000 credits from the store. But the truth is without the EXP you gain from battles, you can't even unlock anything worth buying.\n\nSo the grind they've implemented actually cuts their P2W factor down by quite a lot. Whether this is a good thing or not is up to you.\n\nATTENTION:\n\nIf you've gotten to this point and are still on board, congratulations! You might not hate this game after all! I mean, I do. But I still play it. It's a love-hate relationship. Anyway, I'll actually outline some game details so you can know what to expect.\n\nFirst, each nation has it's own advantages and disadvantages. For example, Japanese torpedos do WAY more damage than UK torpedos. But UK's armor on their ships can take IJN cannons all day.\n\nThe different ship lines are: DD (Destroyer), CL (Light Cruiser), CA (Heavy Cruiser), BB (Battleship), CV (Aircraft Carrier), and SS (Submarine). They're each good at different things, and to win you must play on your strengths as a team of different ships.\n\nWhen you first choose your capatin, you'll enter into the harbor to inspect your ship and enlist crewmen. There are 4 types of crewmen: Weapons Officers, Support Officers, Engineering Officers and Aviation Officers. Each one has 3 different stats you can put points into as they level up along with your captain, who has his/her own 5 stats you can level up. All of these stats change the way your crew works. For example, if you have Weapons Officers that are high in Reload but low in Accuracy, then you'll pump out the shells but they'll spray everywhere at longer distances.\n\nFinding a battle is easy enough: Click the "Battle" button. They have a "Platoon" system in place that will allow you and 2 friends to enter in the same battle. If you have a larger group however just have everyone hit "Battle" and you'll find each other :)\n\nDuring battle, the goal is to be the best (insert ship class) you can be by racking up damage points and capturing objectives. If you are sunk during a battle, you can wait until the end of the battle to receive a larger EXP and Credit bonus towards your ship and crew.\n\nI would recommend this game to anybody looking for something different and interesting to play. I mean, ♥♥♥♥... it's free. What's the worst that could happen? You actually like it?\n\n\nHINTS:\nAsk questions. People will answer.\nGive your torps at least 1 second to arm.\nVISION IS OP\nIf you're a DD and there's a sub around, use your damn sonar.\n'Gradual' firing mode is good for learning how the shooting mechanics work.\nAP ammo removes the armor so HE does full damage.\nThink ahead: Put points into your commander as if you were playing the ship you want to play from Day 1. You'll be way better off. Ex: If you're building an aircraft carrier, give your commander aviation points instead of weapons.\n\nThanks for reading, and I apologize for any misspellings. If you need a friend to roll with, send me a request and I'll support you as best I can. I have one of each ship class and would be happy to help you in any way I could if you need it :)\n\nJust send me a pm or comment and I'll do my best!","March 5, 2015","true","60.3"," 241 of 304 people (79%) found this review helpful 22 people found this review funny","79","241","304","22","10"

Now, ships are un-moddable objects with a couple unlockable upgrades for slightly more accuracy or speed.\n\nIn NF1, games were custom lobbies. Hosts could choose game-types and maps, as well as auto ballancing or manual. Now, there's only a matchmaking button. CO-OP games against AI have been removed too. That makes practicing manual firing mode tough.\n\nThere are many more aspects of NF1 that are removed or dumbed down for NF2, those are just the biggest two that stood out in my first few games.\n\nFinially, and this is just my opinion, but I liked the high detail 2D graphics of NF1 more than the low detail 3D graphics of NF2.","March 9, 2015","false","0.9"," 131 of 172 people (76%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","76","131","172","6","0"

The game has P2W elements. I dont know why the other reviews say no P2W. (they obviously didn't check the shop/they think no sane person would purchase them when thats not true for people with jobs)\n\nFew examples: %5 less reload time with ingame credits. %10 less reload time with real money. Theirs different types of this like repair rate ect. On top of that they all weigh less on your ship as well. (less decreased speed on gold purchased upgrades) PLUS: They stack up as well on your ship.\n\nMorale boosts with real money so you can make sure you are having close to 100% of your sailor stats or you can easily go negative or just not reach there without a grind of wins.\n\nAlso you can get gold officers which start with +31 of a specific stat. Ingame credit officers start with all 1 stats and will most likely cap out without the 31 bonus that gold officers get only.\n\nTheres just no excuse for having this type of monetization. Should of kept it to skins and premium time.

A little history behind this game and mine statement:\n\nI have played this game few years ago when it had been released by Nexon and it was bad. Game was closed after few months because it did not have player base and why? Because it was unbelievable Pay To Win - just few examples: premium captain, premium crew members, premium ships, premium account, premium armour, premium upgrades and what had been the best? Everything had been time limited for 1 week or 1 month EVEN PREMIUM SHIPS!\n\nSo as I mentioned it have been closed. But then the original developer of NavyField 1 and Navyfield 2 decided "Hey, it is not so bad, maybe we could get more money of it!" so there were few days long alpha, few days long closed beta, few days long open beta (if I sum up CBT and OBT together it lasted for 12 days) and then they released this piece of crap. And even though that there are weekly updates they have not changed much past 4 months. (I have played from CBT)\n\nFew changed like no premium ships, not limited premium crew members and few more are good changes and I have to say it is much better game than it was but it is pretty much the only thing that this game does well and even though it is still Pay 2 Win.\n\n-There are still premium crew members, there are still some premium upgrades (few more XP, few more Credits ...) which does not look very good but in fact they are difference making.\n- Balance - This game does not have balance! You have tier 1 ship? No problem here play against tier 7. And that is pretty much how it does (not) work.\n- No Variety - Everything in game is pretty much the same. You wont be able to tell which ship is which, you wont be able to tell which nation is which. This brings me to another -\n- Year 2015 - This game is not for this year. It runs on Direct X9 and demands 8GB RAM, wut?! It is not even full 3D, water quality sucks, ships details sucks, animations sucks - the onnly pretty thing is the dock but if we compare it with NavyField 1's dock it sucks.\n- Grind - Everything starts great you can get rank 5 in 3-5 hours. But then it comes. 150K XP for one gun upgrade, 150K XP for another gun upgrade, 300K XP for next ship, and then again 200K XP for one gun upgrade (which are btw. almost useless), 300K for another gun upgrade and then WOHO only 4milions XP for next ship. Isnt it amazing? And the best part is that for most of the thing you need twice as much credits as XP so 1st you grind XP and then you grind for money.\n\nI do not recommend this game. If you want decent and good naval game wait for Wargaming's World of Warships. Do not waster your time AND money for this game (yea I know it is Free to Play well guess what? It is not after you get into it).","March 5, 2015","false","1.4"," 209 of 329 people (64%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","64","209","329","15","9"

But the game isnt bad at all. Sure the graphics are a bit outdated, but graphics dont make the game. And it really is a free to play. I didnt have to go to my wallet for any boosts or buying ships.\n\nThe game has factions of WW2: USA, Japan, England, and Germany. It has all kinds of ships. battleships, destroyers, aircraft carriers, light and heavy cruisers. Even heroic ships, the USS Nevada, Duke of Wellington i think it was,  and the legendary Bismark. Now this game is very easy to learn and get into really quickly. You can work your way to your first battleship in less than a hour.\n\nNow the gameplay itself focuses on two sides:alpha and bravo. Each side has a flagship, so losing the flagship is like losing the queen piece in chess. And once you die, you die. So there is a ton of strategy depending on your role.\n\nOn the bad side, ugh took too long to make an account, and if you're new, you will die a lot, but least you get good points and xp.

Navy Field was a game which rewarded skill and practice, learning angles, timing torpedo runs, hiding from the enemy fleet as a submarine. It was a truly fun if a time consuming game. Each ship had a role and they all worked as a combined unit\n\nNavy field 2 is none of that, its too arcadey. Ships are far too agile with Battleships easily turning and slotting through torpedo runs when turning in them should be a large effort, they act more like Destroyers in Navy Field than Battleships. On top of this you have Carriers, all ways fun in Navy Field as they were strong but any ship which could slip in could kill them easy and submarines were there bane but in this they are pretty much freexp, torpedo planes can drop and arm torpedo's from 2 meters and this makes Dive Bombers pointless and fighters are not worth the time as they cannot kill Torpedo planes before they drop there Torp run.\n\nOverall if you want an Arcade warship game then turn to World of Warships or Battlestations: Pacific, if you want a fun Sim type navy game then try Navy Field but this tries to be both and succeeds at neither","September 7, 2015","false","1.4"," 35 of 42 people (83%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","83","35","42","3","1"

I will try to give an objective review of the game and not its competition.\nSecond, I won't review balance, or what I think are temporary issues. The developer is fairly reactive and each weekly patch brings a lot to the game in my opinion. There are still issues, but I judge a game by its fun and its potential.\n\nPros:\n- Gameplay is fun. Very fun. It is fast paced, team-based, strategic, and skill and positioning are a huge part of the game. You'll never get bored during a game. Guaranteed. Too much to do and think about.\n- Gameplay is varied. Playing a BB (Battleship), a DD (Destroyer), a CV (Aircraft Carrier) or a SS (Submarine) is very different, so that you can add variety to your gameplay from one game to the other or just find your playstyle. Each ship has its role (even 2 CLs can have very different roles depending on their loadout). You constantly switch between weapons (guns, torps, planes, mines, depth charges, AA, ...) and try to make the most out of it while navigating your ship. Significantly different maps. Game is surprisingly deep.\n- Beginning progression is very fast so you can get any class of ship within hours, and then you have to invest your time to get the top tiers. They just boosted permanently XP and credit gain by 2 and 1.5 respectively, for everyone.\n- Game makes it in a way that a tier I can take out a tier VII if played correctly/smartly. Very rewarding.\n- NOT Pay 2 Win. Premium account gives you the usual XP and Credit boost for faster progression. Some real money items give increased (temporary) stats in game but to the order of 10% max; which is definitely overcome by skill and teamplay. It is more P2W than games with a pure cosmetic cash shop, but I strongly believe the advantages are not significant.\n- Developer is its own publisher/editor, on this instance of the game, which means faster development cycle and patches.\n- Easy game to get into (simple basic controls, basic goals, immediate action, ...) ...\n\nCons:\n- ... but difficult to actually understand. Poor documentation and tutorials forces you to discover things by yourself, or ask the community, to understand better how to play. Community is decent and people will answer your questions. This problem sometimes leads to frustration, but it is rewarding to get to know the game better. Lots of "Eureka" moments.\n- Linked to the above, but the game has its quirks, ie some unintuitive stuff from controls to interface. You get used to it after a few hours.\n- "Korean grind" game. You will 100's of similar games (but never the same).\n- Graphics and effects are outdated\n- historically inaccurate","March 5, 2015","true","65.6"," 57 of 94 people (61%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","61","57","94","7","0"

If you're looking for a free-to-play naval game with arcade like gameplay then you should give this game a shot.  I only recommend it as such though, do not expect 100% realistic gameplay or you will be dissapointed.\n\nPros:\n\n1)  Ship types are not only useful but neccessary for a team to win.  A team with 10 Battle Ships will lose to a mixed force that plays the map properly.\n\n2)  Similar to World of Tanks there are smaller vessels that exist in high tiers.  Think of it as light tanks or medium tanks at high tiers except with ships.  They all have their role on the battlefield.\n\n4)  Personal skill means a lot.  You cannot simply stomp someone just because you have a higher tier ship.  If you rush in without care then you will see lower tier ships mop the floor with you.\n\n5)  Rock-Paper-Scissors balance.  As stated above you need a mixed force however you can get hard countered by certain ships.  Submarines are able to take out Battle Ships and Aircraft Carriers with ease if the Destroyers and Light Cruisers do not hunt them down.\n\n\nCons:\n\n1)  As in World of Tanks or War Thunder there will be games you just cannot win due to having a team that does silly things.  Personal performance can only carry you so far and some games are just unwinnable.\n\n2)  Aircraft have no fuel gauge so if you plan to roll up the CV line you better have good micromanagement skills.\n\n3)  Some people say the game is insanely grindy.  In the past that has been true however the XP gains have been adjusted to reasonable levels.  This makes it possible for anyone to get into ships earlier than they probably need to be.  It only took 400 games to reach Tier 9 in the CV line but then again most people would say that's too much for an arcade like game.  XP has been doubled since then so hopefully that issue isn't around anymore for newer players.\n\n4)  No physics for ships.  You can stack all the ships together and have them occupy the same space.  If anyone shoots they'll hit the others which leads to people never "crossing" eachother to avoid accidentally blowing up the ally who cut across them.  A very cheesy tactic is to move your ship into the same space as the enemy ship so that their team cannot help them without blowing up their ally.  Meanwhile you can just pound away at their ship from within their footprint in the water.  Some ships have no way to lower their guns and cannot hit targets that close... all they can do is hope the smaller ship inside them runs out of ammo as they die a slow painful death.\n\n\n\nIs this game good?  I think so.  I'd pay $20.00 for this game if they asked since it's on par with the quality you would expect from a $20.00 game.  The matches do not last very long, 15 minutes tops, which means you can knock out a round or two before work or whenver you got a bit of free time and I like that.  Many tactics have evolved as people unlock different ships and soon organized Fleet Battles will come out and give the game a competative aspect.  Give it a shot if you love skill based Free-to-Play games that have no Pay-to-Win.","March 5, 2015","true","2.9"," 42 of 67 people (63%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","63","42","67","4","0"

The core naval combat game seriously rocks. Zaggat rated 5 stars.\n\nBattles are 15 minutes long, if you survive that long or decide to stick around and watch the end after you are sunk. Ship on ship combat is nearly perfect, though the boats move a bit too fast for my taste, but you do get used to that. Graphics are nice except for anything written. They use some font that doesn't work well on my PC. Legible when tweaked, but not great.\n\nThe pay-to-win elements are truly kept in check, unlike most games. To me, this speaks volumes about the devs. They actually understand that a well-balanced game will bring in more money. Every P2W element gives a slight advantage, but this game is so heavily skill-based that those slight advantages can be easily overcome by superior skill.\n\nThere are 2 main gaming areas: the Battlefield and the Shipyard. The Shipyard is where you get new ships, put equipment on your ship, train your officers, etc. The major flaws in this game have nothing to do with battle. Battle is great. I mean it. Great. The flaws are with peripheral things like: It is hard to register to get the game started, there is no steam overlay (at least for some users currently), when I started the game, I couldn't read anything. Their FAQ page said to make your GUI bigger in Game Options if you can't read the font. The real solution was to turn down my screen resolution one level. Everywhere you look in the Shipyard will be phrases that were obviously translated into English by a computer translator, and then never proofread by a person who actually speaks English. Much of the instructions are tragically non-sensical. Fortunately the wiki is getting bigger everyday, and the forums and guides are good. And players in chat are helpful (which is another nice change of pace). So the Shipyard can be a bit difficult to figure out, but nothing there is real-time. You can always stop and ask for help when confused in the Shipyard. But that's it for flaws. Minor flaws that make you roll your eyes, but nothing that affects the core gaming experience, which is happily rock solid.\n\nLots of newbies think this game is too hard, but it's usually because they don't understand that their small fast low-level ships can get to the enemies' big ships quicker than their own big ships can get there. Then they try to fight the big enemies without the back-up of their own big ships who won't arrive for another minute. This is a thinking-person's game. This game relies on understanding your role in a complex team, which few people seem to get. Then they complain that matches are made that put them up against top tier ships. Well guess what? You have the option to run away! Just at the start of battle, look to see the names of the players in high tier ships and avoid them, noob! It is a fun challenge if you don't play it like a boxing match where if you see an enemy you attack without thinking! There are things for low level players to do besides fight, like capture npc bases to give your team an airfield or something. Sheesh!\n\n8.6/10 Would sink while desperately trying to dodge depth charges in my sub again.","March 28, 2015","true","192.9"," 42 of 69 people (61%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","61","42","69","11","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/LKHERO/recommended/338540/","LKHERO","HERO","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LKHERO/","104 products in account","Navy Field 2 is a good game in the sense that you're never bored.  Sure, the grind to the highest tier of ships can be boring at times, but not every game is the same.\n\nLet me break the game down really quick and justify why I can recommend this game.  Each game takes 15 minutes to play and every class has a use.  Destroyers can take down Battleships with good torpedo placement and kill subs, Light Cruisers can hunt down Destroyers and aircraft, Heavy Cruisers are very much pocket Battleships and Battleships, well, deals tons of damage from afar but have limited maneuverability and sigh.  Carriers are just as important because you're constantly fighting off enemy aircraft, providing your fleet with line of sight, and bombing other ships.  Sometimes the matchmaking will get a little wonky and put you in games with higher level ships, but I've had games where my lower tier Destroyer will be able to drop a high-tier Battleship so I'm not complaining.  Not too much anyway.\n\nThe game is not as Pay to Win as most people make it out to be.  It's more of a grindfest more than anything, and the Premium account will make it easier to grind.  It's as simple as that, since there's nothing that's actually limiting gameplay.  Sure, you can spend gold and buy a few Officers and whatnot to edge out on higher-level opponents, but for the most part they are not necessary for the game.\n\nSo let me go back to the 15 minutes per game part.  Even if you lose because you got blown out of the water, you can quit the game with some reward and begin your next game immediately.  The combat game itself is fantastic for this regard because there's always something to do.  Every second I'm managing my ship's speeds, dodging torpedoes, shooting off torpedoes of my own, training my guns for an effective angle and lead, and being aware of the map at the same time.  Having played RTS and MOBAs competitively, I would say this definitely ranks up there in terms of active things you can do to improve your game.  This is where the skill of the player comes in, and comes in in a big way.  A player that can take full advantage of his ship will be able to come up in a big way vs. a player who doesn't, regardless of tier.\n\nOverall, I definitely recommend players give this game a try.  It's fast-paced and can be unforgiving at times, but that's what I look for in a game that's designed around leveling up and tiers.  You need the combat to be highly engaging so the grind doesn't seem endless and that's what Navy Field 2 does very well.  The one thing that the developers needed in the game was proper documentation.  I feel that the game right now is a lot of bro-science.","March 24, 2015","true","308.3"," 35 of 57 people (61%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","61","35","57","4","2"

Absolutely.\n\nQuestion #2: is Navy Field 2 as good as World of Warships? Not in a million years.\n\nThat really is the truth of the matter. World of Warships beats NF2 in pretty much every category. It has superior historical accuracy, it's more immersive, it has a larger player base, it has better support, more map and game mode variety, and overall is a better game. NF2 is a top down shooter with arcade models; WoWs is a graphically beautiful simulator with serious ships. There really is no contest. If you have a good enough machine and graphics card to play WoWs, stop reading this and go download it.\n\n...aw hell, that would be too easy. Okay then: here are four things that NF2 does better.\n\n1) NF2 has more ships. A LOT more ships. The US Navy, Royal Navy, IJN and Kreigsmarine are all featured, whereas WoWs is still in open beta and only has the US Navy and IJN. With the occasional exception (no King George V-class battleships), all of the notable ships are there-and yes, that includes the Yamato. And yes, those 18 inch guns hurt like hell.\n\n2) NF2 has subs. WoWs does not. While some destroyers in WoWs can be savage little ninjas, you only get true stealth in NF2. It is actually fairly well balanced to boot. It's not easy to use a sub well, but when you do, the rewards are spectacular. Equally, it takes time for destroyer drivers to learn how to hunt a sub. When an experienced sub and an experienced destroyer meet, it leads to a tense game of cat-and-mouse.\n\n3) Unlike WoWs, which puts similar tiers against each other, there is no such limitation in NF2. It is entirely possible to play your first game in a massive 15v15 match, with a Yamato and an Iowa blazing away at each other which you whizz about in your pokey little beginner destroyer. You really do have no idea what you'll run into when you hit the Battle button, and the possibilities for emergent game experiences are substantial. While that can lead to some difficult games as you fight against higher-tier ships and more experienced players, it can also be quite fun.\n\n4) NF2 has decent community, overall. It is absolutely advisable to join a Fleet; like all multiplayer games, it's best played with friends. Doing damage to a Yamato in your tier 1 destroyer is great; distracting a Yamato while your two friends in their battleships sink the monster is even better.\n\nI hope that helps. NF2 is fun-just don't expect it to be as good as WoWs.","August 2, 2015","true","121.8"," 33 of 57 people (58%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","58","33","57","7","4"

However, unlike most others, you don't pay to get ships, you need to earn them. The only thing you're paying for (or at least want to pay for), would be the premium 50% boost that helps in the grind through ship tiers later, the officers for an extra boost, and/or extra ship slots to keep more ships (honestly, you don't need more than 5 if you plan on sticking with one or two classes). Otherwise, everything is obtainable through just playing normally.\n\nNow, the matchmaking. Yes, it needs some tweaking. You're not always going to be placed against people of your tier level, but I believe there's a good reason behind this, being that you get to experience fighting against different types of ship classes. And remember that the matchmaking puts you against a fleet (not clan fleet, just a fleet) equal to yours, meaning if they have Tier 9, you have buddies who are Tier 9 as well (or Tier 9 equivalent). The downside? You get wrecked if you're not careful.\n\nBest advice for new players is to capture islands, sub detect and provide AA, while trying to support your team from behind and survive. Everyone starts out as a Destroyer so you don't get to do much unless you're really good with your torpedoes and shelling first hand (I've sunk Battleships, just saiyan), it's pretty easy. Heck, you might even manage to land a kill steal and get that huge amount of XP.\n\nEventually you'll reach Tier 3 in a few battles if you try to power through all the upgrades and not invest in any of your ship equipment. My friend did it in less than 30 minutes. You CAN face against stronger enemies even at low levels, but that relies on teamwork, not charging into everything.\n\nThe community. I haven't really talked to many, so I can't really say, but I've had battles won with teamwork where we were outnumbered, some cooperative, some not. It happens.\n\nThe grind. I'm a fairly new player myself although I've played since February (before dropping it for a while cause gemes), so I have yet to reach that part of the game. I'm still at Tier 5, using Destroyers, and I can tell you the amount of XP and credits you accumulate increase based on the ship tier you're using, so you might get like 300 or 400 at say, Tier 2, before getting 2000 to 3000 at Tier 5. Then again if you think the game's fun and all, it might not be so bad to invest time to grind, but if you're not that kind of person, better decide now whether you want to drop it.\n\nGraphics? Ship docks look good. Actual game? Not so much. What, were you expecting some WoW or WT tier graphics?\n\nMy opinion? The game isn't nearly as close to frustrating me. I just like naval games and try to have fun. :v\n\nShould you play it? Well I mean, just because there's a lot of mixed reviews doesn't mean you shouldn't try it out and see for yourself.\n\n(NOT SPONSORED BY NAVYFIELD 2)\n\nEDIT: So after countless battles, I am now at Tier 7, with ships of different classes also at Tier 7. To be honest, the game isn't really that frustrating once you get used to it, since you win and lose (although you lose more and that's kind of a good thing since XP gain is much faster with losing compared to winning).\n\nThe grind, however, becomes increasingly harder. And it's more around the amount of XP required for each upgrade before you get to the next ship than the XP gain itself. For me though, it's not a problem, since I enjoy playing the game either way. It gets a bit repetitive here and there, but eventually I managed. With 4 ships at Tier 7 equivalent (under 2 weeks of grinding; 1-3 hours a day), what's to not get bored of?\n\nPsst, the maps.","May 29, 2015","true","48.8"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","69","9","13","2","0"

I'm still at Tier 5, using Destroyers, and I can tell you the amount of XP and credits you accumulate increase based on the ship tier you're using, so you might get like 300 or 400 at say, Tier 2, before getting 2000 to 3000 at Tier 5. Then again if you think the game's fun and all, it might not be so bad to invest time to grind, but if you're not that kind of person, better decide now whether you want to drop it.\n\nGraphics? Ship docks look good. Actual game? Not so much. What, were you expecting some WoW or WT tier graphics?\n\nMy opinion? The game isn't nearly as close to frustrating me. I just like naval games and try to have fun. :v\n\nShould you play it? Well I mean, just because there's a lot of mixed reviews doesn't mean you shouldn't try it out and see for yourself.\n\n(NOT SPONSORED BY NAVYFIELD 2)\n\nEDIT: So after countless battles, I am now at Tier 7, with ships of different classes also at Tier 7. To be honest, the game isn't really that frustrating once you get used to it, since you win and lose (although you lose more and that's kind of a good thing since XP gain is much faster with losing compared to winning).\n\nThe grind, however, becomes increasingly harder. And it's more around the amount of XP required for each upgrade before you get to the next ship than the XP gain itself. For me though, it's not a problem, since I enjoy playing the game either way. It gets a bit repetitive here and there, but eventually I managed. With 4 ships at Tier 7 equivalent (under 2 weeks of grinding; 1-3 hours a day), what's to not get bored of?\n\nPsst, the maps.","May 29, 2015","true","48.8"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","69","9","13","2","0"

I don't have a deep knowledge of every aspect of NF2, this is more from a new players perspective.\n\nBasically, its a fun game that is flawed. The tutorial is short and nearly useless, but after going through that 2-3 times and playing a dozen or so battles and you get the idea. Once you get the hang of leading targets and using the focus fire you start to settle in pretty fast with the different ship types/playstyles.\n\nThere is a wide variety of ships in branching trees that work logically for the most part. There are a few ships which seem out of sort with dreadnought-era tiered against others from 20-30 years later but these issues end up moot through balancing. Each ship has upgrades for modules which are limited but do add to your ships capability.\n\nEach nation you play will have a crew. As you play your crew levels up. This leveling up leads to an annoying amount of micromanaging after battle as you increase crew skills. As the commander levels up you can also add more officers to yield even better crew stats overall. You can pay for gold officers which yield slightly better bonuses than credit officers. There is also an aid you can buy (both silver and gold ones) which can help you gain XP/credits faster.\n\nThen there is the economy. The first 3-4 tiers are pretty easy to unlock. After my first two hours or so I had a BB and CA.  Then it starts to slow down and feel a bit grindy by tier 5-6. Ships start costing a lot more but you don't earn much more XP/creds. Rewards for each game sometimes seem totally random. I have gotten near identical rewards for a game where I died early without landing more than a few shots and another with a few kills where I doubled my HP in damage done.\n\nOverall, I like NF2. I can't take it too seriously with the P2W elements (consumables, crew/officers, consumable slots etc), but in my opinion its flaws are outweighed by the fun arcade shoot em up style of game play.","March 9, 2015","true","15.8"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","53","8","15","2","0"

No hard stats are available anywhere, and I'm still finding out new features that exist by reading the forums, etc. This stuff should be explained in-game clearly.

I wish the economy system would reward damage over kills due to the fact there is a reward system for getting kills in matches which leads to alot of kill stealing. Doing that would not make the economy kinda feel broken in the game where you easily outgain you credits while getting xp unless you are constantly getting kills.","March 6, 2015","true","12.1"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","3","6","0","0"

So dont get confused with 0 playtime.\n\nSecond - I cant recommend this game.\nWell, seriously - I cant.\nThere is Pay-to-grind-less - yes.\n\nThere is Pay-to-WIN - no, but close to, because premium officers have better stats, premium equipment have double stats (+5% accuracy - normal, +10% accuracy - premium one)  - so Visa can give you an edge in fight, and quite a sharp one.\n\nTeam based and team dependant - because matchmaking sometimes throws crasy setups in battle (maybe because of low player base).\nNo information about game mechanics given, players have to figure out everything themselves - and it's costly.\nNice but primitive visuals.\nStill bugs in game.\nFar from optimal interface (IMO).\nSteam account integration problems.

It is NOT pay to win.  It has some stat boosts for purchase and they may help slightly but its not whats going to win the games for you, its your skills.\n\nNF2 has a great quick progression till you hit Tier 5 and then it jumps up in grind but you will at that point a solid ship of the line that can really contribute to the battle in a major way.\n\nI recommend this if you don't mind a bit of grind and some outdated overhead graphics.","March 7, 2015","true","46.5"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","47","7","15","0","0"

The engine seems OK and if you can get used to finnecky controls you could probably learn to play this game with not much trouble. But myself I don't really like it. I fell like it's riddled with too many minor design flaws that, while not breaking the game, really show how unpolished this is. For example, you aim with LMB and fire with spacebar. Well, why not give the players the option to, I dunno, rebind the fire to RMB? Just a suggestion.\n\nBut yeah, battles are decently fun once you learn how to do what. The pace is much slower than something like, I dunno, TF2, but rapid enough to feel action packed, especially for a naval simulation game, while at the same time not as slow as I dunno, World of Tanks. Why did I bring it up? Because it seems to follow a similar economy model.\n\nIf only he controls were a little more responsive, I'd play this game, but hey it's got potential.","November 15, 2015","true","1.2"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

But really, most of the negative things mentioned in the reviews don't seem to be that bad.\n\nThere's ZERO chance the grind is worse than World of Tanks or any other games. Unlike WOT, even if the round is lost, you get quite a bit of award according to your performance / dmg. done.

You would have thought the game would have come some ways from its 2013 beta release.\n\n-Note: play time shows nil, but I've been on it before steam release.-\n\nThe game revolves around a tedious upward grind on different ship trees, some required to unlock another class (ex. Play as destroyer, unlock heavy cruiser, then unlock carriers). To unlock the next ships, you have to research a string of "upgrades" until next ship is available for research in the end. Quotations around "research" because they seem to have been chosen at random for each ship or are just meaningless (like gun or boiler upgrades that cost you thousands of exp but improves absolutely nothing). Each tier of each class consists of only one ship and even though the first ships come fast, gameplay eventually gets stale and boring. Wasn't a fan of Warthunder but at least they had more variety with several vehicles per tier.\n\nTowards the endgame, exp walls take on an exponential climb. If you're a free user, its very unlikely that you'll ever get to touch the endgame ships. And before any SDE fanboy chimes in with "Stop whining, NF1's grind was even worse, this is nothing", then you're missing the point. Anyone can make a game model focusing entirely on a neverending grindfest (with cash/premium shortcuts of course!). It takes very little effort and imagination but it still seems good at raking in the cash from the whales.\n\nIngame:\n\nDepending on ship, controls can be a bit clumsy and matches are always unbalanced to the point of being rigged. Don't be surprised to have your 1895 heavy cruiser facing Battleship Yamato or your submarine 1v2 against a pair of Destroyers on a tiny map. You don't see much teamwork either and ships rarely tend to play on their ship's main roles. And why would they seeing as how the game rewards all the same regardless of what you're doing. Despite the different classes, they all virtually play the same: cap a base, go deal as much damage as you can,  die/kill yourself, then quit back to lobby. Repeat. The faster you get at this, the faster you can progress. Without premium, however, it feels more like you're in a hamster wheel.\n\nSurprised this isn't listed as an early release or beta as there's still some bugs. Some aspects like endgame rewards don't even make sense at times. Players that carried team often get rewarded less than the exp farmers who torpedo rush suicide or guys hanging out back taking random potshots. I guess its a work in progress and they'll iron it all out eventually. Right after they release that new set of ship skins in cash shop.\n\nIt wasn't all bad though. The music is okay I guess. It doesn't get as annoying as NF1's. The ship descriptions were interesting.\n\nI haven't tried World of warships yet but from the videos I've seen it looks like a lot more action going on over there. The only people I'd see recommending this with a straight face are diehard armchair admirals who care nothing about gameplay quality or SDE fanboys and suck ups. To everyone else, I'd look elsewhere.","March 7, 2015","false","0.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

NF2, I am disappointed. I spent 100s of hours, and $100's of $$$ on the Original Navyfield. Frankly, the original took me by surprise. As a hardcore 1st person pov simulator fan, I would not even have given Navyfield a chance had I not been invited by some AA clan buddies. Once I started, I could'nt stop. It amazed me how such a graphically simple, top down view game could put its hooks into me so successfully. So of course after having discovered there was a Navyfield 2, and on Steam (which I now have embraced), I could not download it fast enough. My first thoughts are here in list format:\n\n- Why can't I skip this damn tutorial?\n- Did I download the wrong game?\n- Why is the background music so friggen loud and why cant I change it? Oh yeah, forced into tutorial!\n- Yay! Done with tutorial... what about recruiting an aide? How? Oh does it cost money? Can tell, oh well, skip it\n- Into battle.... did I hit a time acceleration button somewhere?\n- Why do the graphics look just like Navyfield I ?\n- Why are the ships turning around like go karts flying around a track?\n\nAnd lastely...\n\n- Where did I put that Navyfiled I installer again... I hope all my old premium stuff I paid so much money for is still there!!\n\n- Navyfield II first experience compelled me to stop playing, not continue and as a Veteran to the franchise left me with a strong sense of disappointment. Like when Disney bought Lucas franchise.\n\nIf your new to NF, this might not seem to bad, but if you are not new... you will be asking yourself, why in the world would I want to play this?","September 13, 2015","false","0.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

A lot of interesting aspects have been dumbed down considerably. Going through the research trees is a dull and grindy process, made worse by the linear upgrades instead of being able to actually change parts of your ships, i.e. the weaponry.\n\nExtremely limited barracks space, 5 ship slots, with some heavy price tags on expanding, and even more insane price tags on stat resetting. (2500 gold for a single crew member. I believe you get 625 gold for $4? You've got a bare minimum of 12 crew members. Go figure...) All this makes it impossible for the free player to focus on more than a single type of ship, meaning if your main is a battleship, and you want to have some fun with a carrier or sneak around in a submarine you'll be a lot less effective at it, which partially ruins the fun of it.\nAlso means that you'll pay dearly one way or another for a single mistake during the stat distribution process. Either due to not knowing about all the limitations such as barracks space, because you misjudged the best stat, or change your mind about what path to take... Or even because you did not first heavily research everything in the tech tree and for example now finding out the final ship in your chosen tree is more focused on deck weaponry, not torpedo's. While previous ships were obviously floating torpedo platforms... Just saying...\n\nFew maps and even fewer unique situations make the game very repetetive, very quickly. While a grindy feeling is unavoidable in games like these, this only makes it much worse.\n\nBy definition, the game is P2W. There are boosts available which can give in-game advantage a free player can never get. The free player is limited to the 5% stat increase items, with a relatively large speed decrease, while paying players can get the 10% stat increase items, with a low speed decrease. You can apply a lot of boosts at any single time, making the gap wider. That said, the P2W items should be of minor influence in most situations, but P2W is P2W.\n\n\nThey should have paid more attention to World of Tanks's model, as a lot of copied directly out of WoT, but not very well.","March 16, 2015","false","14.7"," 7 of 16 people (44%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","44","7","16","0","0"

Big differences between this version and NF1:\n\n1.  No Gun options, what it comes with is what you get.  Most ships you can upgrade the guns for more damage, better accuracy, and faster reload, but it feels to be a major "miss" when compared to NF1's modifications.\n\n2.  No Premium Ships currently.  This is good and bad at the same time, as in NF1's premium ships were by no means a "pay to win" option, but if you got good with them they did help you grind a bit faster.\n\n3.  Manual aiming is a huge pain in the A.  Not sure if it's the quicker speed of the game (all ships feel like they are moving at lightspeed in comparison) and manual aiming is too slow.  Combine that with any amount of lagging at all, and you end up with a big loss.  I only ever used auto aim for a few cl's and ca's in NF1, but in this version I haven't managed over 20K damage with manual aim mode.  Maybe it's better with bigger boats, but I'm kinda doubting it.\n\n4.  Lag, lock-ups, and another loss.   Any time you "Retreat" or have to Quit the game due to your game lagging out and then freezing, the game counts that battle in your win/loss record as a loss.  Not a big deal if you don't care, but NF1 a lot of us prided ourselves in having a 60-75% Win ratio.  Not possible to maintain that with 5-10 auto losses in a 4 hour sitting due to servers gumming up.  And it's not player's computer, as it seems to be affecting everyone equally, no matter system specs.\n\nAll in all, the game is fun.  But with the many issues, frustrations, and annoyances, it's just not worth putting any money into the game.  Give it a go maybe if you have some time to kill, but I would give this title a pass.","May 10, 2015","false","88.8"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

Submarines should not be able to submerge so quickly after attacking.\n\nUntil the game undergoes a few balance checks, this will remain a resounding "No."","March 16, 2015","false","2.9"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

Who has the most health\n2. Who has better firepower\n\nThere is a recipe for doing well in this game, and those who follow it will win everytime, there is no room for diversity, all your team has to do is launch an enromous volley of torpedoes, and let the battleships camp beyond enemy view range. Vview range as a whole is a pointless idea in maps as small as this, real life warships could make out an enemy ship that was at the edge of the horizon. Any kind of tactics or flanking or whatever will get you not only killed, but swarmed by torpedoe spamming destroyers. In this game numbers win regarless of the ship you sail, or the skill you have. The matchmaking is such bulls**t that you will often run into boats twice your size, and your in a battleship. Personally I don't get the point of the aiming in this game, why can't a normal mouse aim be suffiecent?. Lastly submarines are overpowered to a point where a single one can kill two cruisers, with one torpedoe, and the AA guns are useless, they don't actually shoot at enemy aircraft until they attck you, by then it's too late. Thank god I didn't have to waste money on this game, and the way World of Warships is going, I know what game I'll have on my desktop.","March 11, 2015","false","9.0"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

GG\n\nUPDATE (not even 30 minutes later)... OK im done... if people want to ♥♥♥♥ themselves hours upon end im not following on the ♥♥♥♥ train.. i'm sick of MOBA/♥♥♥♥♥♥♥T games.... I quit WoT because of the amount of higher tiers and not even being able to touch them.. this is even more ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t... Battleships vs beginner destroyer with barly any dmg... how well is that going to go..\n\nI'm not fully bashing on the game, the idea was wonderful, it brought WoW before it even came out in fact, i think this would be its little brother.. But when it combines WoT's broken tier system it is hell on earth for new people who don't know what their doing. Devs, give the new players a chance to fight and put them into their own tier, follow War Thunder's system, A. it will get you a lot more players possibly, B. It's more of a chance to have people who will sign on daily instead of for 5 minutes play one match then get off and never come back like me.\n\ni'm sorry if this review seems like i'm complately against it and want to keep people away from it. If you play WoT jump right on in you'll feel right at home. i myself am not a WoT person, i haven't even got to tier 2 yet in it and i played for 2 months almost every day. It was because when i DO get a kill, it's either the person is a complete ♥♥♥♥♥ and runs around like a chicken with it's head cut off or the guy is AFK.. Otherwise its the other way around and i end up getting made target practice. I have better odds on War thunder as i'm in a tiger and working on a king tiger, it took me only 2 months to get that tank and it's tier 3 in fact  late tier 3.. i get a kill 100% each game i play unless either i mess up my loadout or i get a tier ahead of me that completely dominates *rarely happens* but anyway enough with my stories...\n\nI would say if you like WoT give this a try... For anyone who hates that game move along. i stick with my opinion that this game SUCKS","June 13, 2015","false","0.6"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

I really loved NF1 played it forever and liked it for its uniqueness.\n\nNow the genre isn't quiet so empty, here we have NF2, World of Warships is coming out, and presumably more are to come.\n\nNF2 to me felt like a dumbed down, simpler, and easier NF1.  Its exactly what I didn't want.  I would have been thrilled at the prospect of a modeled and rebalanced NF1.  Instead we got rid of manual aiming and everything is now auto-aim to some degree which really removed a great amount of player skill from the game.\nThey just really missed the mark in my opinion, a large part of what made NF1 great even for people not a fan of ships was the interesting and skill oriented aiming system by removing this they effectively removed the main skill from the game.\n\nIt feels more like an easy cash farmer now, the sort of f2p program shoved out to make a dime not be a great game.

I really loved NF1 played it forever and liked it for its uniqueness.\n\nNow the genre isn't quiet so empty, here we have NF2, World of Warships is coming out, and presumably more are to come.\n\nNF2 to me felt like a dumbed down, simpler, and easier NF1.  Its exactly what I didn't want.  I would have been thrilled at the prospect of a modeled and rebalanced NF1.  Instead we got rid of manual aiming and everything is now auto-aim to some degree which really removed a great amount of player skill from the game.\nThey just really missed the mark in my opinion, a large part of what made NF1 great even for people not a fan of ships was the interesting and skill oriented aiming system by removing this they effectively removed the main skill from the game.\n\nIt feels more like an easy cash farmer now, the sort of f2p program shoved out to make a dime not be a great game.  So its with a great amount of disappointment I'll say I can't recommend this game.","September 17, 2015","false","7.5"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Great game right. Also this might be my graphics card but I'll say it anyway. I get 0 FPS when in the main menu. That means the game boots up and crashes, all I get to do is log in. I can't even change settings around becuase you can't get into the options untill you pass the toutorial. Also another thing was from the trailer it looked like a World Of Tanks clone, except naval combat syled. I do not recomend this in any way unless you have some super computer and like the game.

GG\n\nUPDATE (not even 30 minutes later)... OK im done... if people want to ♥♥♥♥ themselves hours upon end im not following on the ♥♥♥♥ train.. i'm sick of MOBA/♥♥♥♥♥♥♥T games.... I quit WoT because of the amount of higher tiers and not even being able to touch them.. this is even more ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t... Battleships vs beginner destroyer with barly any dmg... how well is that going to go..\n\nI'm not fully bashing on the game, the idea was wonderful, it brought WoW before it even came out in fact, i think this would be its little brother.. But when it combines WoT's broken tier system it is hell on earth for new people who don't know what their doing. Devs, give the new players a chance to fight and put them into their own tier, follow War Thunder's system, A. it will get you a lot more players possibly, B. It's more of a chance to have people who will sign on daily instead of for 5 minutes play one match then get off and never come back like me.\n\ni'm sorry if this review seems like i'm complately against it and want to keep people away from it. If you play WoT jump right on in you'll feel right at home. i myself am not a WoT person, i haven't even got to tier 2 yet in it and i played for 2 months almost every day. It was because when i DO get a kill, it's either the person is a complete ♥♥♥♥♥ and runs around like a chicken with it's head cut off or the guy is AFK.. Otherwise its the other way around and i end up getting made target practice. I have better odds on War thunder as i'm in a tiger and working on a king tiger, it took me only 2 months to get that tank and it's tier 3 in fact  late tier 3.. i get a kill 100% each game i play unless either i mess up my loadout or i get a tier ahead of me that completely dominates *rarely happens* but anyway enough with my stories...\n\nI would say if you like WoT give this a try... For anyone who hates that game move along. i stick with my opinion that this game SUCKS","June 13, 2015","false","0.6"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

With a somewhat competent tutorial you probably could've easily understood how to play the game. Too bad your just given a few guides and are slapped on the back.\n\nWith a somewhat decent ship you probably could do something against others. Too bad your given a rustbucket that will die as soon as it touches water with water pistols instead of cannons. Did I mention that the guns feel like water pistols? They are horribly innacurate and often dont even travel as far as the game says they should.\n\nEver feel like you earned a level up? Well thanks to the fact that your up against fully upgraded, max rank ships you never will! You are just handed level ups, experience, and money just for showing up which does nothing to deter people from just showing up and afking for experience and credits until they can get a max rank ship, and I don't blame them. With the way progression works you can't just get any type of ship you want. You either have to pay a premium or research through a long tree before you may be able to get the lowest tier of a ship that you may not even like playing.\n\nThe actual gameplay is fairly fun, but you'll be shot out of the water exceedingly quickly if you even dare going into a battle. Have a group of people with you who can survive for awhile and you will just watch or alt tab as you watch... and do nothing else.\n\nMy most horrendous bone to pick with this game however is the fact that it pretty much punishes new players for being new. You want to play against a veteran? Well even if the veteran stands perfectly still and lets you shoot him with 100% accuracy thanks to the progression system you'll run out of ammo before the guy even gets to half health. You want to play a battleship and an air carrier? Well get ready to pay way too much money or sink hours into the game so you can get ♥♥♥♥♥♥ tier 1 ships of both just to figure out that you hate both ships. want to go to the front line? Well either have really fast movement or really really thick hull or your just going to die, but thanks to the progression system you wont have any ships that are fast enough or tanky enough to do anything.\n\nTo summarize:\nBad Tutorials\nAggrivating controls\nMatches dumb mice against intelligent lions\nExceedingly limited ship choice\nPUNISHES NEW PLAYERS FOR BEING NEW\n\n","March 13, 2015","false","3.0"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

Be ready for bad people, bad interfaces, and countless bad deaths (at the hands of both teammates and enemies).\n\nThey say the community is nice and helpful, but apparently "nice" means they shoot you for no reason and "helpful" means they yell "noob" at you and everyone else. The grind is... really wonky. One can get several new ships within a few battles  and apparently nothing really affects one's rewards from battle. So, even if you just get blown up with no idea what you're doing (which I did when I was starting out) you'll still have a full set of ships within minutes... if you can figure out how to get them, as the interface is strange and gives few to no hints about how to use it. Is that an icon or a button? Better check it all! The grind shows up after those few, but is more of what I'd expect from an early game experience for about one tier, then goes immediately into "Just imagine what that tier 5/tier 6 ship will be like when you get it next week!" I imagine the T10 users have been playing since before the game was released and just acquired them. Oh, and the "report a player" button on their site did nothing until I tried another browser, at which point I got an "Under Construction" popup. Their "Contact GM" area was apparently locked off because of some email verification thing. I couldn't be bothered... I figure any game attempting to be half-decent will not only have player reporting available but have it easily accessed in-game.\n\nOh, and people don't seem to care to play as any sort of team. Typically several ships will be found faffing about, maybe fully capping some base or just napping in a corner while everyone else dies. Apparently people will actually grind by capping something and then suiciding. I even saw a carrier torpedo bomb itself to do this.","April 3, 2015","false","13.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's not the same, it's probably worse mechanically and it doesn't reward skill and knowledge as much as it's predecessor; but it's newer and more modular. The grind curve grows exponentially when moving up ships, you can go from T1 to T7 in a day, but T8 and T9 may take weeks and T10-T11 may takes months. It's a top-down arcady naval shooter that's one-of-a-kind and very roughly based on real historical WW1 and WW2 ships. The Devs work pretty hard adding new content and fixing bugs but their PR guy needs work. It's a fun game to play on and off and the pay-to-win doesn't really shine through like most freemium games.","April 4, 2015","true","127.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Not really, keep it free and keep it simple and keep in mind that the grind is korean style grind after a couple tiers. The only negative stuff is the matchmaking that sometimes pits your rubber boat armed with 2 goats and a rooster against the freaking Yamato armed with atom bombs. Other then that its a nice game all around.\n\nEDIT: here are a few tips for people to enjoy this game ( somewhat ) ,\n\n1. Lower your expectations, and i mean really to a bare minimum\n\n2. Matchmaking.. inexistant, you can go against a rubber boat armed with 2 goats just like your own or against the Yamato firing nukes and your goat boat\n\n3. Teammates.. well lets say Asians have about as much insight and witts playing this crap as a russian has manners,  yes you will be stuck with asians for the most part and most are really that bad.\n\n4. Dont fret, stay behind the big guns, chances are you can score hits and not get hit by your teammates ( yes they are that bad )\n\n5. Torpedoes are your friends, use them wisely, and if your team is dumb enough to run into the path of them ( they will be ) just chill and wait for the reload while getting out of range.\n\n6. This is supposed to be a 3D game , of sorts, yet you can shoot your own teammates but there is no boat colisions so if you have to make a run dont be scared because you wont ram anyone, just make a quick dash for freedom because if your teammate shoots you will eat a full load point blank.\n\n7. The comunity is very very small.. i poped the same guy 10 times and fought with the same team 10 times in a row, that speaks for itself, game was boring as ♥♥♥♥, but then again you might get some gem of a balanced game now and then.\n\n8. Dont buy premium stuff, most of it is expensive and it just runs for a couple days , so this is pay your way to whatever it is the devs had in mind and keep throwing money at them .. dont .\n\nAll in all i have to change the recommend this game to no, damn this is way too bad to even be in Steam... i'd say this game is halfway to cheating people out of their money and Valve is allowing it.\n\nPlay the game, for free, stay for free until World of Warships comes, that game is way way better then this one can ever hope to be.","March 25, 2015","false","42.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Not really, keep it free and keep it simple and keep in mind that the grind is korean style grind after a couple tiers. The only negative stuff is the matchmaking that sometimes pits your rubber boat armed with 2 goats and a rooster against the freaking Yamato armed with atom bombs. Other then that its a nice game all around.\n\nEDIT: here are a few tips for people to enjoy this game ( somewhat ) ,\n\n1. Lower your expectations, and i mean really to a bare minimum\n\n2. Matchmaking.. inexistant, you can go against a rubber boat armed with 2 goats just like your own or against the Yamato firing nukes and your goat boat\n\n3. Teammates.. well lets say Asians have about as much insight and witts playing this crap as a russian has manners,  yes you will be stuck with asians for the most part and most are really that bad.\n\n4. Dont fret, stay behind the big guns, chances are you can score hits and not get hit by your teammates ( yes they are that bad )\n\n5. Torpedoes are your friends, use them wisely, and if your team is dumb enough to run into the path of them ( they will be ) just chill and wait for the reload while getting out of range.\n\n6. This is supposed to be a 3D game , of sorts, yet you can shoot your own teammates but there is no boat colisions so if you have to make a run dont be scared because you wont ram anyone, just make a quick dash for freedom because if your teammate shoots you will eat a full load point blank.\n\n7. The comunity is very very small.. i poped the same guy 10 times and fought with the same team 10 times in a row, that speaks for itself, game was boring as ♥♥♥♥, but then again you might get some gem of a balanced game now and then.\n\n8. Dont buy premium stuff, most of it is expensive and it just runs for a couple days , so this is pay your way to whatever it is the devs had in mind and keep throwing money at them .. dont .\n\nAll in all i have to change the recommend this game to no, damn this is way too bad to even be in Steam... i'd say this game is halfway to cheating people out of their money and Valve is allowing it.\n\nPlay the game, for free, stay for free until World of Warships comes, that game is way way better then this one can ever hope to be.","March 25, 2015","false","42.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You control your future!!\n\nIn other words, easy to master controls and you can overturn outcome of a match with\nyour own skills!\n\nNot like other naval games where you only have 50% or less chance of winning even\nif you are a great player!\n\n\n2. Great Balance!\n\nYou have real balance in that you have real armament!\n\nIn other words, if you are a Battleship you cannot be beaten up by a low tier Destroyer.\n\nThe lower tier person really has to better than you in skills, tactics, etc.\n\n\nYou don't have endless shells or torps so, you have to really fire wisely!\n\n\nTherefore, real strategy and real aiming.\n\n\nYou control your scout, you guns, aa, torps, etc!! meaning you can really punish your\nenemy, not wish for fate for shooting down enemy bombers for example!\n\n\nIf you know your range and understand your firing rate, and then you can definitely beat\nthat lower tier, time and time again. No luck but true skill!\n\nNo unrealistic lower tier beating your great ship. Real Armours, even against torps too!\n\n\n\nOvercome all odds and still win!\n\n\n\n\n3. Different Styles to Choose From.\n\nBattleship, Carrier, Destroyer and Submarines, together with LSTs make game play really interesting.\n\nAt higher tiers, good controls, skillful use of weapons, and good team strategy makes every game more interesting.\n\n\nGood bye to loser games where people just Camp and get a draw!\n\n\n4. And STEAM !!\n\nAnd together with STEAM, like my favorite other vintage strategy game, Age of Empires,\nI feel this game will run for the long run!!!\n\n\nGood work !\n\n\nWhat are you waiting for!\n\nBattle Stations!!\n\n\nEnjoy real Navy Warfare.

Sure, the MM is a little strange at times and every so often you get battles that one team is seemingly heavily stacked - but even then it is possible to win. But onto the actual game.\n\nIt has an arcady feel that, despite the drastically different camera angles and graphics, distinctly reminded me of Battlestations: Midway. Perhaps it's just because of it being an arcade, ship based game, but it doesn't really matter; as I played more I began to enjoy myself more and more. I initially intended to simply play a while whilst another game was in a prolonged maintainence, however this quickly changed into playing it heavily.\n\nInitially you start off in an early (often pre-WWI) ship, for the first few tiers you can expect to unlock new ships pretty regularly, I think I'm up to Tier VI as of this review in approximately 10 hours of playing (half way to seven, but I'm probably going to change tree which will slow me). You can chose from 4 nations, with each nation having a relatively balanced tree, whilst still maintaining some national traits (Japanese Torpedos are really, really good for example). Whilst from what I gather the grind starts to become more noticeable from tier V onwards, I've already claimed a couple of tier IX, X and XI ships in my little destroyer and my CA just claimed a high end BB.\n\nWhich brings me to the MM - yes you get put in battles against high tier ships when you are playing low tier ships. And honestly? If you don't like the concept of merely being a cog in the machine for your team, this might not be the game for you. That said, I loved the challenge of having to take an early destroyer up against teams with Yamatos and Vanguards, and thus I see no issue with the MM. The biggest problem at the moment is slow queue times - but they aren't unbearably bad and at some times of the day you can get matches with decent frequency.\n\nThe graphics are a little poor - but really, they don't need to be any better, and the visuals are more than adequate for the game. The audio however is good - especially the music which fits the gameplay very well. The UI is a little complicated, and the extremely minimal tutorial you get means you are rather required to ask other players for explanations on certain things; but unlike most of these types of games, the community is helpful.\n\nSpeaking of the community - not only are they helpful as mentioned above, but also there is far, far less rage than in most online games, all of my matches thus far have been with light hearted people who often laugh at silly mistakes rather than screaming at you. Additionally, in several battles where I've been chasing the last surviving enemy in my DD, high tier BBs have allowed me to score the kill rather than taking it for themselves (which they could easily do) which speaks to a far greater level of decency than I've come to expect from online games.\n\nOn a final note, the F2P model in this game is instantly recognisable as a fair model - so far as I can tell, there is virtually nothing that is exclusively bought with gold, meaning you are never outclassed by premium vehicles, and never need to buy premium vehicles to sustain yourself, in addition to this the economy seems relatively generous - there are no repair bills, meaning no real drain on your credits other than things you chose to buy.\n\nOverall - if you enjoy the challenge and the thought of tactical naval battles, and don't mind the queue times and occasionally unfair matchmaking, this game is definitely worth trying. I had hesitated over downloading it because of reading the negative reviews - my experience of being seal clubbed in other WWII combat games by higher tiers put me off greatly when I read about people fighting tier XI ships with tier II ships, but now that I've tried it, I'm glad that I did as it was certainly worth trying. Seeing as it's free even if you are uncertain - it could be worth downloading and trying it for yourself rather than listening to any review (including my own.)","July 22, 2015","true","180.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

So seriously steam, make a marking system or a five star system like apple's, it's really needed.\n\nI'm not here to tell u how this game plays or how it compare to WoWS. The one thing I know for sure is I can launch WoWS and play it, with this game I can't. The game updater seems to be physically unable to download any update file that's bigger than 1MB. The download just couldn't continue when it progree hits a file like this. I spent nearly 10 hours trying to download and launch this game before I finally give up, uninstall and come here to write this down. I know there is possibly a problem with the update server, since I can't even download the manual ptach file, which is posted by the developer in the steam community, with my browser. Maybe the problem will get fixed in future sometime, I don't know, looks like the developers also don't know because I haven't seen any announcement about this yet. However, I have already lost the patient to wait and see how it goes. WoWS is pretty alsome and WT is going to have a naval battel mode that plays no worse, why do I want to waste my time on this one? This game comparing against those two? I wouldn't even dream it if I was the developer of this game. But then again, if I was the developer of this game, I would at least make sure players can actually launch the game and play it before anyone says anything about the gameplay.\n\nGood luck to all future players who tries to play this game, and I hope by the time u guys get to try download and launch this game, the problem I faced and had no way of fixing has been resolved and u all can have fun. unfortunately I won't be there with u.","June 27, 2015","false","11.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

While NF2 have lots of bad reviews but i really do enjoy how you can just jump in and have a quick battle anytime you want, and the variety of ships is plenty for me to choose from and suit my own battle style.\nbut the biggest dissapointment for me has to be ship upgrades. I dont mean the overall 'tech tree' upgrade, i mean single ship upgrades. Because the stats upgrades just feels very or almost no effect on your ship. Apart from a few ship can have different main battery upgrades, otherwise the upgrades most of the time gives you less than 5% improvements.\nI know this is acurate and balanced since you cant just upgrade a tier1 ship that grants tier 5 ships abilities, but still... i still think the upgrades could be done better by giving more options on types of guns to equipt or upgrades to grant ships additional firepower.\nForexample the myoko or tone is known to have torpedos, maybe add torpedos to them will be a better upgrade compare to like 0.03% faster reload or 0.1% more firepower...\nAnyway i'd say im gonna have at least another 100 hours on this game, but if nothing changes after that, is verylikely ill get bored and quit like many others has","October 5, 2015","true","155.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Unfortunately, I can tell you that I am quite disappointed after spending a fair amount of time on NF2.\n\nNavy Field 2 is a WW2 naval battle simulator where players take command of a ship (or submarine) of varying classes: destroyers, light cruisers, heavy cruisers, battleships, aircraft carriers, and submarines.  Progress towards higher tier ships is accomplished by completing ship research towards the next ship, which in turn can be done with "ship exp" earned in battles.  Ships themselves as well as some items to boost ship performance can be bought with credits earned in battle.\n\nWith that quick summary it sounds like NF2 could be quite fun, and it could be--except whatever fun I derived from the first week or two of blasting other ships slowly dwindled.  There are several fundamental problems with NF2 and the company that supposedly supports it.  I will list what comes to mind:\n\n-There is only one battle mode.  NF2 is a multiplayer-only game where players are placed on a team of up to 16 players and pitted against a team of up to 16 players with ship tiers roughly matched.  Then it's basically a death match for up to 15 minutes.  That's it.  The only variations are the maps, so playing NF2 will become repetitive.\n\n-A beginner doesn't have a whole lot of documentation to help overcome the learning curve.  In fact, there's very poor documentation for a NF veteran!  Game mechanics are not fully explained in-game or on the website, and often I had to figure out a number of things on my own.\n\n-NF2 is free to play, which also means cash shop items.  That's right, there is a pay to win aspect of NF2.  Personally I haven't had much of an issue against pay to win, but the setup is very poor.  I will only address pay to win aspects that affect gameplay.  The system is that players have "sailors" who gain experience in battles.  There are various specializations for sailors (ex. a gunner can be specc'd for faster reload speed), but all of them have this variable called "morale."  Morale has a hard cap of 200% and an initial maximum value of 120%.  Morale affects sailor performance, and increases when battles are won and decreases slightly when battles are lost.  Now for the nasty part.  Maximum morale can be raised by buying an item in the cash shop.  There exists a version of this that can be bought for a tidy sum of in-game credits, but this version actually has a risk of failing.  As you can guess, a risk-free version exists for cash.  Besides the obscene amount of money you'd need to max out morale for just one sailor, there is very close to no official documentation on anything related to morale.\n\n-Updates are frequent (usually weekly), which is good, but are generally awful.  Many weeks have featured a "patch" where a ship gets some adjustment.  Okay.  Problem.  There is no context provided for many changes, and many undocumented (utterly unannounced) changes take place.  As of the writing of this review, a recent patch 2 weeks ago introduced a large number of new ships, but undocumented changes nerfed a number of existing ships that the community would agree are completely uncalled for.  No GM on the forums has commented on these changes.\n\n-There's no incentive to keep playing.  Seriously.  The only possible goal in this game is to get a higher tier ship, but after tier 5 (tiers go up to 11) the requirements for the next ship increase steeply.  Players can join fleets, which are kind of like guilds, except there's pretty much no point.  There are no fleet battles or other incentives to join a fleet other than to have a tiny pixel of a picture next to your name in battles.\n\nI was hoping things would get better, especially with the latest big patch introducing more ships, but it's clear that NF2 lacks developers who know how to support and develop a game.  I definitely would've stayed away from NF2 months ago if I knew what it was like and how it wouldn't change.","June 5, 2015","false","125.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You will almost always be sent into matches with far higher tier ships, however, and you must be prepared to run away from them or just support your own higher tier ships until you get better vehicles. It's not impossible to defeat P2W players and even a starter ship can defeat a Yamato battleship with the proper handling (and quite a bit of time).\nThat being said, the matchmaking does make it very difficult for new players, especially if they want to go down the battleship lines.\nI can't compare this game to its predecessor as I haven't played NF1 that much, but it is certainly not a bad game.

Sure, the MM is a little strange at times and every so often you get battles that one team is seemingly heavily stacked - but even then it is possible to win. But onto the actual game.\n\nIt has an arcady feel that, despite the drastically different camera angles and graphics, distinctly reminded me of Battlestations: Midway. Perhaps it's just because of it being an arcade, ship based game, but it doesn't really matter; as I played more I began to enjoy myself more and more. I initially intended to simply play a while whilst another game was in a prolonged maintainence, however this quickly changed into playing it heavily.\n\nInitially you start off in an early (often pre-WWI) ship, for the first few tiers you can expect to unlock new ships pretty regularly, I think I'm up to Tier VI as of this review in approximately 10 hours of playing (half way to seven, but I'm probably going to change tree which will slow me). You can chose from 4 nations, with each nation having a relatively balanced tree, whilst still maintaining some national traits (Japanese Torpedos are really, really good for example). Whilst from what I gather the grind starts to become more noticeable from tier V onwards, I've already claimed a couple of tier IX, X and XI ships in my little destroyer and my CA just claimed a high end BB.\n\nWhich brings me to the MM - yes you get put in battles against high tier ships when you are playing low tier ships. And honestly? If you don't like the concept of merely being a cog in the machine for your team, this might not be the game for you. That said, I loved the challenge of having to take an early destroyer up against teams with Yamatos and Vanguards, and thus I see no issue with the MM. The biggest problem at the moment is slow queue times - but they aren't unbearably bad and at some times of the day you can get matches with decent frequency.\n\nThe graphics are a little poor - but really, they don't need to be any better, and the visuals are more than adequate for the game. The audio however is good - especially the music which fits the gameplay very well. The UI is a little complicated, and the extremely minimal tutorial you get means you are rather required to ask other players for explanations on certain things; but unlike most of these types of games, the community is helpful.\n\nSpeaking of the community - not only are they helpful as mentioned above, but also there is far, far less rage than in most online games, all of my matches thus far have been with light hearted people who often laugh at silly mistakes rather than screaming at you. Additionally, in several battles where I've been chasing the last surviving enemy in my DD, high tier BBs have allowed me to score the kill rather than taking it for themselves (which they could easily do) which speaks to a far greater level of decency than I've come to expect from online games.\n\nOn a final note, the F2P model in this game is instantly recognisable as a fair model - so far as I can tell, there is virtually nothing that is exclusively bought with gold, meaning you are never outclassed by premium vehicles, and never need to buy premium vehicles to sustain yourself, in addition to this the economy seems relatively generous - there are no repair bills, meaning no real drain on your credits other than things you chose to buy.\n\nOverall - if you enjoy the challenge and the thought of tactical naval battles, and don't mind the queue times and occasionally unfair matchmaking, this game is definitely worth trying. I had hesitated over downloading it because of reading the negative reviews - my experience of being seal clubbed in other WWII combat games by higher tiers put me off greatly when I read about people fighting tier XI ships with tier II ships, but now that I've tried it, I'm glad that I did as it was certainly worth trying. Seeing as it's free even if you are uncertain - it could be worth downloading and trying it for yourself rather than listening to any review (including my own.)","July 22, 2015","true","180.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

So seriously steam, make a marking system or a five star system like apple's, it's really needed.\n\nI'm not here to tell u how this game plays or how it compare to WoWS. The one thing I know for sure is I can launch WoWS and play it, with this game I can't. The game updater seems to be physically unable to download any update file that's bigger than 1MB. The download just couldn't continue when it progree hits a file like this. I spent nearly 10 hours trying to download and launch this game before I finally give up, uninstall and come here to write this down. I know there is possibly a problem with the update server, since I can't even download the manual ptach file, which is posted by the developer in the steam community, with my browser. Maybe the problem will get fixed in future sometime, I don't know, looks like the developers also don't know because I haven't seen any announcement about this yet. However, I have already lost the patient to wait and see how it goes. WoWS is pretty alsome and WT is going to have a naval battel mode that plays no worse, why do I want to waste my time on this one? This game comparing against those two? I wouldn't even dream it if I was the developer of this game. But then again, if I was the developer of this game, I would at least make sure players can actually launch the game and play it before anyone says anything about the gameplay.\n\nGood luck to all future players who tries to play this game, and I hope by the time u guys get to try download and launch this game, the problem I faced and had no way of fixing has been resolved and u all can have fun. unfortunately I won't be there with u.","June 27, 2015","false","11.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This should not be a real problem if you understand that when you are small you are also hard to hit. The other way round is this in the favour of the starter. What most beginners forget is that the game is team based so don't sail the ocean on your own or you will be bait for the sharks. I have read a lot of complains about the bad balanced beginning but that is definitely not true. In my first games I already did a lot of damage and sunk some ships already!\n\nI would recommend to play the tutorial and read the controls list to learn a bit how the game works.\nYou are not using modern day ships that have missiles instead you have to estimate where to hit the target. This is not difficult and you will learn this fast. I have read complains about planes being impossible to hit. The first time I fired at a plane with AA shells (that you have to use of course) I destroyed it. I noticed that ships without AA shells do auto damage to planes but this is not that effective but good enough to keep them at distance.\n\nThere are a lot of ships in the game that can be obtained by experience so it takes some effort to get the ship that you want. After de first day I already got a battleship that needs two good shots to destroy a destroyer and is also able to compete against the "bigger ones".You can buy large ships for real money but these ships can also be obtained in free to play. This makes it not a "pay to win" game but more a "pay to win faster" game.\nGraphics are not that good but in my opinion graphics are not that important in a game. The most important thing is fun and that can be easily get when you blow a fleet with a small destroyer for instance.\n\nYou must be in the naval subject to play this game otherwise I am afraid that this game is not that fun for you.\nI am looking forward for World of Warships but I am also looking forward in to future updates of this game because I like naval games like these.\nI give this game a 9/10 because of the variety of ships and the game-play. -1 for the not that good graphics when you look at NF1 and because the game is not that fun for playing in one session. It is more a game you play until you get bored and log on the next day when you like to blow some battleships again!\n\nI played World of Warships and it is.almost the same (not graphically). A bad thing about it is that there are no submarines coming to that game while Navy field has them.\nAnd I heard rumours about ships not just from the Navy powers like the USA and Japan but also ships from smaller navies like those from Italy, USSR. and even the Netherlands in the future updates.

Took a gamble and bought it.\n\nLove the game play. Easy to play and get a handle of the controls. As ever its the tactics that win the game. I really enjoy it.\n\nI've seen a lot of negative feed back about the players and the tier system. I got no issues with it. Sometimes you have a losing streak some times you can't be touched. Sometimes you can play against an organised team and get steam rolled. Just like any other MMO. I joined a team of nice people and haven't had a bag experience.\n\n","July 29, 2015","true","46.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
