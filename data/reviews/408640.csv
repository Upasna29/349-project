"http://steamcommunity.com/id/pepsimanvsjoe/recommended/408640/","pepsimanvsjoe","pepsimanvsjoe","http://steamcommunity.com/id/pepsimanvsjoe/","1281 products in account","The difficulty with reviewing this game is that I'm also obligated to mention its spiritual predecessor. Guardian Heroes, a cult-classic beatemup released in 1996, is one of my Top 10 Favorite Games of All-Time. Naturally, this should cast a very large shadow on my opinion of Degica's latest release. Is Code of Princess a better game? Is it worse? This is why I've never been a fan of comparison reviews, because they do a disservice to both games. Nevertheless, I'm going to say something that some readers will believe to be a cop-out answer: Code of Princess is different. This isn't a game designed to build upon Guardian Heroes or the changes/additions made in its 2011 re-release. Instead, this game is a unique take on Treasure's multi-plane fighting/beatemup series, one that started with Yu Yu Hakusho: Makyo Toitsusen on the Sega Mega-Drive.\n\nBeatemups, like any other videogame genre, consist of ideas. The first entries involved fights between street gangs, rescuing kidnapped girlfriends, and finding freshly-cooked turkeys inside of barrels. Today's beatemups haven't strayed too far from these humble roots, but they have developed outward through the accumulation and expression of ideas. Code of Princess is a very unique game. The characters are a collection of quirks. Their move-sets range from the typical to the absurd. Instead of 5 to 8 levels of side-scrolling action, this game is divided into well over 100 short quests.\n\nNow when I call the characters a collection of quirks, I'm not just referring to their odd attire. Solange dresses like she inherited the contents of her mother's underwear drawer, and she swings a sword that must weigh twice as much as she does. Next we have Ali, her partner, a thief who doesn't just attack with a dagger. She can also throw bombs, whistle to get the enemy's attention, and teleport. Zozo is a necromancer who built herself out of spare body-parts, and she fries everyone with magic. The blind samurai Tsukikage fights with typical slashing attacks, but he also "flies" across the screen like the heroes from the movie Duel to the Death. The 2,000 year old bard Allegro swings an electric guitar... and you get the idea.\n\nThis motley assortment of heroes is further bolstered, by the plethora of enemies that you'll unlock. Everyone, from the final boss to the tiniest slime, has a set of moves. Of course, with over 50 playable characters, there are also a handful of stinkers. On the other side of the coin, a few opponents border on overpowered. That's the price of freedom, and I gladly accept it. Having so many fighters to experiment with is really entertaining. Furthermore, every hero, monster, or otherwise, can improve their stats through level-ups. Some characters can use equipment that improves their stats and bestows special abilities. This lends a unique approach to combat depth, though some weapons and armor... border on overpowered.\n\nOn the field, there are a few factors that set this game apart from other beatemups, even Guardian Heroes. Your "burst" ability allows you to stun opponents and do more damage. This ability costs 100 mp to activate, and is cancellable at any time. However, while this ability can be abusable in the right situation, even a stunned opponent can respond with a burst of their own. Every character has a lock-on attack. When an enemy is locked onto, the player can do more damage to them. Certain special moves also have homing properties when performed during a lock-on. Last and certainly not least is your armor. When you take damage, your armor (green meter) is reduced. When this is gone, you have 0 defense, and attacks do far more damage to your life (red meter). This is one of those times where bursting is very handy, because it restores armor. Certain attacks do more damage to armor than life, so it's worth switching tactics if enemies are taking far too long to beat.\n\nThe combination of characters, stats, and equipment lend Code of Princess a "sandbox" feel. Now when I talk about the sandbox, I don't mean in the sense of The Elder Scrolls or Minecraft. It's more along the lines of exploring the mechanics of a beatemup. Think of it as finding out the effects of certain moves, the properties of attacks, and combining abilities to destroy adversaries as quickly and creatively as possible. These aspects of the game are very compelling, and will keep players coming back long after the story mode is completed.\n\nAlongside the campaign, you can unlock a wealth of bonus quests. These challenges are targeted at the advanced players, and can have unique win conditions. I hate to say it, but there are a few escort-missions in this game. Sometimes it's best to go back to the character-select menu, and choose someone apt for the task. Now I could use the mighty dragon, but his attacks cause a lot of collateral damage. Instead I went with someone fast, who quickly reaches enemies, so that they can't immediately crush the idiot townsperson I'm trying to protect.\n\nCode of Princess also has a bevy of multiplayer modes, for both competitive and cooperative players. The versus mode offers something for everyone. If you're looking for a "fair" fight, without all of the high-stats and special equipment, then there's no need to worry. Alternatively, if you have to put all of that experience grinding to use, then you're also covered. However, the cast of this game isn't balanced very well. For one, a handful of characters have infinites, which is something to look out for. There are also some exclusive quests aimed squarely at co-op gamers.\n\nIf you're a fan of the traditional arcade-style brawler, this probably isn't the game for you. While there are options to fight versus matches with default-strength characters, the bulk of the game is designed with the expectation that players will level-up, allocate stats, and decide on equipment. In short, there might be too many RPG elements for some. Bursting can also bring down the pacing of a versus match. Since they can be executed at any time, some fights will devolve into bursts countering bursts. Bursting can be an effective tool, like using Street Fighter Alpha 3's V-ism activation to counter moves. However, I don't think allowing the player so many opportunities to burst is a good idea. As far as nitpicks are concerned, certain large-scale attacks can cause the screen to shake a little too much. The soundtrack is also really bland.\n\nCode of Princess is like I said, a beatemup with ideas. Not all of them are great, but they're creative and lend the game a lot of flavor. It helps that the mechanics are pretty solid, and there's fun to be had in beating enemies up. It also can't be stressed enough; having this game run at a playable frame-rate is a huge boon in itself. I owned the 3ds version for a spell, and on average it ran three to ten(!) times worse. All in all, I think that this game is worth checking out.\n\nDisclaimer: For the purpose of this review, a key was provided by the publisher.\n\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group","April 14","true","21.9"," 176 of 208 people (85%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","85","176","208","12","5"

I was and am very excited for this PC port. The frame-rate stays at a steady 60fps and even though the resolution is 720p it never bothered me since I was having so much with the game-play. You also have the option to have dual-screens with the 3DS menu features.\n\nThere are so many characters you can unlock and play in co-op mode with friends, but only four of them can be used in the campaign. There is so much customization you can easily make your character a powerhouse, a speedster, or even both. Combos are a blast to keep going and taking advantage of character's unique move sets keeps each stage exciting.\n\nThe campaign's story is loose and a great satire of the rpg-genre from the half-naked heroine to the plot of being "chosen ones" all done with a terrific Japanese dub. But, I do wish there was an option for English voice-overs due to some mis-matched subtitles and loose translation.\n\nOverall, I felt this was a great port of a 3DS game. The graphics might be chunky in places, but that's what it is; a port, and if you'd wanted to try out Code of Princess, but don't want to go digging up a small screen 3DS copy, the Steam version is fun and has online co-op/vs. to keep you invested.\n\n(Disclaimer: I was a beta tester and received a early access of the game.)","April 14","true","9.4"," 31 of 42 people (74%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","74","31","42","5","3"

Hack and Slash with RPG elements thrown in to keep the gameplay interesting and fresh.  Also there's a good amount of items and equipment to horde so looters will have a blast.  It's a perfect model of Guardian Heros on the Sega Saturn with individual character levels based on their use, the ability to jump from the middle lane to the back or front as well was first implemented by Guardian Heroes to great effect in this game as well to get the jump on other lane attackers.  There's special moves, combos, stat buffs and equipment that enhances your character as well.  Also as mentioned, you get two ability points after finishing a quest so you can pad your weaker stats with those points or buff out your larger stats if you feel so inclined.\n\nAll in all it's a mix of Guardian Heroes and Castle Crashers with more GH than CC but both clearly played a hand in influencing this game as well as titles like Final Fight, Double Dragon and the list goes on and on.\n\nGraphics: 9\nGameplay: 10\nRelative ease of learning the game from tutorial: 10\nStory: 9\nReplayability: 9, plus I didn't mention before there are four other characters to unlock to play with as well!\n\nOverall, I'd buy this if you're looking for a solid hack n' slash with RPG elements thrown in.

It's a game that's similar to those in concept, but plays in a much clunkier fashion. Apparently, it's a spiritual successor to Guardian Heroes, which unfortunately I've never heard of outside of the name, but as an old school brawler fan, Code of Princess really doesn't scratch the itch.\n\nYou can pick from a growing cast of several characters throughout the main story or basically any monster during online coop and versus play. That's pretty cool and they all control differently. However, they're not really balanced amongst each other and some have movesets that are just regrettable, such as double tapping in one direction does not cause all characters to run, but instead they might make a slow skipping motion. Combos and move sets aren't terribly difficult fortunately, but here's where the game snags.\n\nThe combat is just not that good. It's grindy, incredibly slow, and not particularly exciting, beyond near every character's ability to smack a mook across the playing field. forcing you to constantly chase them down. You can increase your stats, but the changes are numerical only in nature and not always easy to perceive as an improvement. Your character can jump up and down 'lanes', instead of simply walking them, with the flick of a button. This adds some minor tactical value, but I found it rarely mattered beyond temporarily avoiding large groups. Why not simply allow the player to just walk there? It feels unnecessarily clunky without adding that much. Other things you cannot do compared to old school brawlers: grapple enemies, make use of dropped weapons (there's occasionally bombs which can hurt anyone), or make much use of the fighting screen. The lanes are mainly identical beyond static destructible obstacles and cosmetic backgrounds, so don't expect a Double Dragon or River City Ransom approach either. This is firmly within it's own category of brawler, for better or worse. There really isn't a lot of skill to be used, even for a brawler style game. Get xp, spend your points, mash the buttons, and that's about it.\n\nMusic is alright, if unremarkable. Voices are all in japanese and follow the usual stereotypes. Sounds are similarly fair, but nothing to write home about. Graphically, the game is reasonably nice, although the screen is bordered and the characters are heavily pixelized. Because they're so close to the viewer, they look a bit blurry and unflattering at times. Animated sequences are admittedly good and befitting basic low budget animes.\n\nUnfortunately, the story and the characters are entirely uninteresting shallow tropes. The heroes and villains are visually stylized but have one note personalities that can usually be summarized in a three word sentence fragment. The story isn't anything new or clever, nor is the dialogue which borders on incredibly lame, but is fortunately quite skippable. There is a somewhat interesting background to some of the fights, where the BBEG assaults towns with monsters, only to save them using the BBEG's own evil army, but it doesn't amount to much.\n\nConcening the Co-op and versus mode, well, it's largely empty of anyone. Few to none seem to play it, so you might need to wrangle some dedicated friends together for that.\n\nAt the end of the day, Code of Princess is basically a mindless button masher with generic anime tropes to compose a slapped together reason to fight the bad guys. It feels weak for a modern title. If you wanna get your inner weeaboo out and you like monotonous combat, CoP might be for you. Otherwise, I'd recommend passing on this.","April 24","false","2.7"," 10 of 21 people (48%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","48","10","21","0","0"

Hand drawn graphics, with the charecters being done in detailed pixel art against a higher res but still 2d background looks nice, the animations esp of the player is smooth.\nAt its core Code of Princess is a beat em up, with light rpg and collectable elements. Your charecters have a mana bar and with simple button taps different special moves can be executed. You also fight on "planes" Just like in Guardian Heroes, and holding block while tapping up or down will quickly  let you shift to a new plane. There are items and stats you can increase to grow your fighter.  The collectable element comes in similar to guardian hero's as in the further you go, the more charecters you unlock. You can unlock "Main" charecters which are involved in the storymode and you can use for campaign levels. You can also unlock the grunt charecters to fight in an arena type deal. Charecters have thier own special movesets but since its based off a simple control set its easy to pick up and play.\nThe only drawbacks are the levels themselves are repetative, and bland, this is made up for by the fun fights. Well worth the price to admission imo","April 15","true","1.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ohdeargod13/recommended/408640/","ohdeargod13","Hero","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ohdeargod13/","239 products in account","This game is great for people who enjoy old-school beat-em-ups like Streets of Rage, Final Fight, or its spiritual predecessor Guardian Heroes.\n\nWhile it has some RPG elements and grinding lower levels definitely helps, it's mostly about how you go about playing. There are four different characters for the campaign (but, puzzlingly, some 7 characters who are in your group of heroes) and tons of characters can be unlocked for co-op or versus mode (even gag characters like an old man). Once you get the hang of the bursting and plane mechanics, it becomes about playing fast and smart to avoid getting stunlocked while doing tons of damage to your enemies.\n\nIf I had a complaint, it would be that the Japanese voiceovers (no English dub option for this port) really don't seem to match up with the text translation. The game's online search also didn't net me any multiplayer sessions during primetime hours (8PM to 11PM EST) despite the game only having been released a few days prior to my review. The campaign took me only about 6 hours to finish with only one or two levels really giving me any trouble. There are plenty of bonus levels, though, and the game definitely seems like it would be fun in online play, which includes co-op and versus modes (including a ranked mode).\n\nDespite my complaints, the port is really well done. There are different display options that are either one large, arcade-style screen or a split-screen DS-style option that show the top and bottom screens with some graphics along the borders to fill the gaps. The game never drops any frames even when there are a lot of effects being used on-screen (and, depending on your character, there can be a LOT of effects).\n\nIf you're looking for a fun and old-fashioned action game, Code of Princess is for you. If you can't get past short length or the rather ridiculous character designs, you might want to pass this one up.","April 17","true","6.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tenpoundpixel/recommended/408640/","tenpoundpixel","tenpoundpixel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tenpoundpixel/","189 products in account","A very rare breed of beat-em-up which features a multi-lane setup instead of a single plane. Just like Guardian Heroes and Panzer Bandit that came way before it, Code of Princess features intense action coupled with some very ridiculous character designs and art done by Kinu Nishimura of Street Fighter fame (odd that they couldn't incorporate her art style for the in-game dialogue portraits).\n\nCombat may feel quite floaty but you get used to it quickly enough. Controls are responsive (inputs are similar to how it's done in Smash Bros. or Tales games) but a controller is ABSOLUTELY recommended. Being a port from the 3DS, it's quite decent and you won't find yourself needing the dual-screen layout much if at all. Lots of unlockables in the form of characters and equipment. Stat building and equipment choices also offer a degree of customization and progression. The game really doesn't take itself seriously when it comes to story so don't expect anything deep (you really shouldn't if you've seen the character designs), Code of Princess feels like something straight out of the 90s Playstation era.\n\nIt's a shame they couldn't redo the sprites for the port as having the 3D render sprites directly from the 3DS resolution upscaled to PC resolutions make it clash with the more smoother 3D environments.\n\nThe major problems with the game come in its other design choices. While you can unlock pretty much EVERY character in the game as playable, only four can be used in the campaign. Three characters who actually join your party don't seem to show up in the campaign roster which is quite disappointing as they have really fun playstyles. You'll only be able to use the majority of unlocked characters in bonus quests and versus modes.\n\nThe implmentation Co-op (which supports a maximum of 2-4 people) is also a very questionable one as you CANNOT run the full campaign in co-op with a friend, instead, your only option is to go through each quest one by one, ending co-op whenever a quest is done and then having to load up the next one manually. Take note of this is you plan to get this game to run the story with a friend.\n\nReplay value comes in the form of completing bonus quests and trying out every character and if you're up to it, maxing them all out to level 99. Some are definitely more harder to use than others (playing as one of the bosses versus an old man NPC). Your mileage may vary but Code of Princess is definitely worth a shot for anyone that likes action games, also, the shop theme may embed itself in your mind for quite some time.","April 20","true","13.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

You also unlock/buy items in the shop to up your stats, but you nearly always just put points into Attack and Mind for damage.\n\nIf you don't rely on your stats to carry you, you can clear the game pretty quick (>2 hours if your good), you may even find there's more cut-scenes/dialogue than gameplay (you can fastforward by holding "c").\n\nIf you're unsure whether the game is for you, I'd recommend waiting for a decent sale, $15 is a bit much for the content. If you like this kind of game, Phantom Breaker Battle Grounds is pretty similar (but larger side-scrolling stages).","April 18","true","5.4"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","2","6","0","0"

I am baffled as to why they thought this would be a good idea, customizable controls have been standard for decades now. Enter and Esc are attack keys for some odd reason, you need to press 1 to quit out or restart a mission. The only way to see the move list is to press F5 to change the screen setup similar to that of a DS (which makes the main screen even smaller) and then you have to click on "Move List" with your mouse, then you have to cycle through more screen setups to get back to full screen. Why couldn't I just use a hotkey instead? This is so stupid, slow, awkward and I hate it. Many controllers aren't supported either.\n\nIt runs at 60fps but is locked to 720p with bars on the side. The characters look really pixelated and bad. I don't see why they couldn't have improved this for the PC version, it doesn't make any sense. I don't care too much about graphics as long as they aren't physically painful to look at and do a good enough job of conveying what they are trying to represent, but many people do and I doubt they will be happy with the visuals of this game. There are no video options outside of V-Sync and windowed/fullscreen mode.\n\nThe gameplay is similar to games like Guardian Heroes and Panzer Bandit. A 2D beat em up with the ability to shift between rows instead of freeform walking about. It's kind of like a fighting game in that you have combos and special moves you can execute with special inputs. From what I played so far the game is extremely easy, but it is the start of the game so that's to be expected. After a mission you get gear that you can equip, but at the equip screen it won't show you what type of armor has new parts. So you have to check each one individually to find the new gear. I was hoping this screen would allow the use of the Page Up, Page Down, Home and End keys for quick navigation but unfortunately that is not the case. They also show armor that your current character can't equip, which serves no purpose but to add more scrolling and make things tedious.\n\nMusic is forgettable, sound effects do their job. There is no English dub despite it being in the 3DS version.\n\nI really wish I could give a more in depth review but the current nature of the port leaves it unplayable to me. I'm not refunding yet as Degica are usually pretty good and I have faith that they will fix these issues soon. If they do then I will gladly change this review to recommend as long as the game itself is great.","April 14","false","0.7"," 49 of 103 people (48%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","48","49","103","2","4"

Hell even nowadays, Guardian Heroes can still compete with Code Princess, even graphically speaking...\n\nBranching stages, levelling system and combat system are clear failed rippoff of Guardian Heroes. Controls are clunky, visuals are awful (seen some mobile free games that looked better) and this lame idea of "voxel/pixel-arting" down some 3D asset in such a crude way...\n\nNo, if you want to have fun, play Guardian Heroes instead, it still beat the pulp out of Code Princess even blindfolded, one arm tied in the back and with a wooden stick.","May 20","false","0.5"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","2","8","0","0"

I regret it. The translation is terrible/padded. They added 3 lines to a character where she basically said "stop talking". The controls are clunky and slow. It feels like I'm playing a second rate PS1 game. Everything feels like I'm in slow motion. Combos are boring and repetitive.\n\nThe good parts? It has a story arc for each character. The anime cutscenes are nice. The pixel animation is average.\n\nIf you want a good side-scrolling, combo-filled, beat 'em up, then get Phantom Breaker Battle Grounds.\n\nThis is the first game I've asked Steam for a refund.","April 18","false","0.8"," 7 of 19 people (37%) found this review helpful","37","7","19","0","0"

Combat felt clunky, characters and story were not interesting at all, and it's a pretty crappy port (the sprites are a real eyesore). I think "almost naked female lead" was their big selling point and they stopped trying after that. Don't waste your money or time on this. The search for another good beat 'em up continues *sad hulk theme*.","April 18","false","0.5"," 6 of 17 people (35%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","35","6","17","0","2"

THis games just plays horrible.. The combo system suck, nowhere near like GH. Most character suck, The magicain ZOZO can't link any combos at all..its slow ♥♥♥ hell. THen you got the missions which they are not great. In GH it keeps the game flowing , on this game its each mission cuts likes its own level...Sorry but I am very dissapointed. Oh the graphics is not good either..","April 19","false","0.6"," 4 of 14 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","4","14","0","0"

It's kinda like those mob in Dynasty Warriors.\nThe combo itself is too simple, it only take 2 ~3 try to get the "kill all" combo.\n\nDoes it worth $15.29 CAD (I bought this game on 10% discount), probably yes.\nI meant the Voice cast member are great.\nThough there are games that is more fun that you could get for this price.\n\nI am not good at word, so I will stop here.\nBut if you are a gamer who is looking for challenge, this game is not for you.\n\n","April 15","false","0.7"," 19 of 61 people (31%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","31","19","61","0","0"
