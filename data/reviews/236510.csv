I had nothing going on but Twitch Streamers and Snicker candy bars. It was a peaceful night until I see the message. "You have 1 new item in your inventory" it read. I scream with joy for this is the first gift anyone has ever sent me. I open it and see the game "Takedown Red Sabre" with the message saying "Hey man, this is the greatest game ever on stream. Graphics are high quality, gameplay is realistic, and the AI is the best! Enjoy!" - my ex-friend. I click install and the game only took 5 seconds to download because it was only 25mbs in size. I launch the game and this...is my story.\n\nThe first thing I had done was click on the graphics options ( so I can disable certain settings because at the time, I had a DELL Inspirion, the greatest laptop NA ) and configure it to my liking until my friend messages me saying "Just max out the settings, you can handle it" I get a bit confused for my PC at the time wasn't the greatest but I just simply followed his orders and started the game. The first thing I had noticed was that the graphics were the worst thing I had ever seen in my life. Poor player models, lame effects, and dirty textures. I thought to myself "Well maybe this game is in beta????" ... I was wrong. I start to move around and I noticed that my AI teammates were braindead. They never followed me when ever I gave them the order to, they never shot until I was killed, and best of all they never even bothered giving me intel on where the enemy had been. So I simply walk by my self down the flight of stairs until I see an enemy. He startled me so I fired... I missed and at that moment, I knew I had ♥♥♥♥ed up. He slowly turns to look at me and then he fires once at my leg. My player stutters then collapses to a fatal position.... He was dead. I scratch my head and wonder exactly what in the actually ♥♥♥♥ just happened. The game is so ♥♥♥♥, that every single weapon kills you in 1 BULLET. No matter where you are shot, the bullet will just kill you. I started to rage so I quit the game at 0.5 hrs completed.\n\nThis will be a game, I will never play ever again. Please, I beg of you, do not buy this game under any circumstances.","May 19, 2015","false","0.5"," 414 of 463 people (89%) found this review helpful 280 people found this review funny","89","414","463","280","1"

The AI is barely functional and has the incredible ability to spot and kill you through walls. Constantly. Moving a single step even crouched can alert an entire map to your position. Endlessly trawling through dull, drab environments looking for the solitary last enemy alive only to be sniped with a pistol through several brick walls across the map IS NOT FUN.

One of the great things about indie games is they always manage to be unique and bring something new to the table (Not always good). They're able to take the risks that triple A companies aren't. This is a company that has made the decision to skip following the generic shooter genre, let's get rid of levels(Maybe this is why there are only four maps...) , noob tubing, and throw in tactics (if by tactics they mean boredom) and strategy (and by strategy they mean endless buyers remorse) instead. Serellan LLC certainly deserves this award for (Ruining) their tactical shooter, Takedown: Red Sabre. (The name of the game also doubles as a request to valve)\n\nTakedown: Red Sabre encourages the player to communicate with their team mates (by yelling at the npcs for walking into walls)  and take on each mission differently (in exactly the same fashion) , in their hope to survive. don't expect to be running and gunning down the hallways, because (good luck finding anyone to shoot) there's no respawning(apart from the fact that you turn into team mates after death). It's a (Dis)pleasure to see a return to the tactical shooter and what appears to be a(n) (un)successful return. Once I got my hands on Takedown: Red Sabre it was difficult to stop.

Okay.\n\nHear me out.\n\nThis game's got some flaws. The movement is kinda clunky and the hit detection is a bit off.\nBUT\nWhat I'm trying to say here is that there's been a little bit of unfair criticism goin' on here. The brunt of it has been on this game's AI. People say it's "bad." But ask yourself this before you count yourself among them. What if this game just features the most advanced enemy morality system ever devised in a video game?\nWhat if, that time an enemy shot your teammate then stared at you doing nothing, what if he was simply, at that moment, being overwhelmed with the crushing reality of the fact that he'd just killed a human being? And you shot him in the face, didn't you? You didn't even think about it. You chalked it up to "bad AI."\nThat terrorist got up this morning, just like you did, put on his beret, kissed his wife and kids, and left for work. His oldest daughter had just gotten into that college she loved. His little boy had show-and-tell that day at school. He was bringing his dad's fatigues in to show off to his friends. He drove to work, just like he had every other day. He said heartfelt "good mornings" to all his colleagues. Jim's wife had gone into labour the day earlier and given birth to a baby girl; Jim's shift ended in two hours. He was going to see her. Tom was the one who always took care of the plants around the office. He didn't mind; it brought a smile to his face. A typical Thursday.\nThey grabbed their bombs and headed out to their routine day of terrorism. Jim and Tom sat around playing cards. Tom couldn't ever seem to win; he just liked playing because he got to hang out with Jim. He couldn't know that this was the last time he would ever see him.\nA frag grenade landed on Jim's lap. A flash of light and a deafening boom. Jim's body had been torn apart by shards of metal before he could react. Tom just sat there, eyes wide, cards still gripped in his hands, just trying to understand what had happened to his friend Jim. As he turned, he saw two more of his coworkers cut down by the SWAT team that was now entering the room. There had been no screams, no chance to cry out. Tom raised his weapon and fired, surprising himself. He hadn't even remembered picking it up. One of the SWAT officers crumpled to the floor, one last monosyllable escaping his lips. Tom stood there over the man, mouth slightly open. He'd done this. He'd killed this man. Why? For what? He hadn't meant to. He didn't even know the man's name. Tom turned toward the other officers, raising his hands. "No, I didn't mean to, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to, please."\nHe would have said these things. He would have calmly knelt down and been handcuffed and gone quietly. He would have lived the rest of his life a shell of a man, haunted by the memories of his friends, gone in the blink of an eye one Thursday. He would have done a great many things. But he wasn't given the chance. Tom was shot thirteen times by the remaining SWAT officers. He was dead before he heard the shots.\n\n10/10 best game 2014","May 20, 2014","true","7.5"," 276 of 323 people (85%) found this review helpful 74 people found this review funny","85","276","323","74","25"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/moosenary/recommended/236510/","moosenary","Moose Flavored","http://steamcommunity.com/id/moosenary/","68 products in account","So I got this game as a gift recently.  Even as a free gift from a friend, this game is not worth playing.\nGiving your friend a gift of this game is akin to giving him a boxed present that is filled to the brim with droppings from a variety of different animals combined.\nWhere can one begin on a game of so many failed things?\nThe controls are stiff and uncomfortable, to start off.  Think "Rainbow Six", except not good.  Movement is a chore and no matter how slow you move, the AI seems to detect you through eight layers of concrete and steel without problem, even though you are making no noise on your end - The disconnect between what you hear and what the enemies can hear is severely disruptive.  You can move faster, but it does not help, nor is it advised.  You will always run straight into one of the AI juggernauts I will cover shortly.  The gunplay is abhorrent; barely tolerable. Every weapon feels, handles, and operates the same way (no differentiation between firearms) and are thoroughly  unenjoyable to use or fire.  The sounds are bland, stock, generic. . . etc.  Any word you can imagine to describe forgettable sounds applies here.  I can't think of a single sound that made me feel immersed, excited, thrilled, or anything you would WANT to feel about sound.  The sound design in this game is on par with Rainbow Six.  That game came out in 1998.\nAnd so we get to the most offensive part of this game: the AI.  The enemy AI, if you would even stoop so low to call it that, is beyond unbelievable.  Not in the positive way, either.  It's so bad it needs its own paragraph to discuss it.  My average experience in this game upon loading a match up is seeing the first enemy in the level, maybe 15 seconds in, go from looking away from me, to instantly rotating 90 degrees towards me in a single frame, and then proceeding to headshot me from 50 feet away, ending my game instantly.  They will either stand still and eat bullets for you, or annihilate you mercilessly and without a single modicum of realism in their actions.  There is no middle ground.  These are hellish terminators bent on the destruction of humankind, loaded up with aimbot and wallhack software, yet with nearly absent pathfinding and tactical skills.  They are idiot savants who are expert marksmen yet walk into walls and freeze up upon trying to navigate the infinitely difficult obstacles of a simple wooden doorway.\n\nThis is not a fun game.  This is barely even a game.  I have difficulty in believing that people intentionally made something this horrid.  I went into this wanting to like it, I truly did.  It had the heritage of Rainbow Six and tactical squad gameplay behind it, devs who wanted to do the old series justice, and the potential that new technology and a fresh perspective could have brought to the genre.  Instead, I was assaulted by an unplayable monstrosity that should have been put down by the evil scientists who created it before it broke loose from their lab.\nAfter playing a while with my friend who gifted me the game, the only redeeming values I found about the entire game were these:\n"Well, the models look pretty good."\n"Aw dude, I can see your flashlight when you shine it.  That's awesome."\n\nWhen the only things I can commend about your work are the above, you know you have problems.\nI do not recommend purchasing this game.  Indeed, if you're reading this, go somewhere else for your tactical action needs.  They will not be satisfied here.","February 8, 2014","false","1.3"," 241 of 279 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","241","279","0","3"

I could never recomend this "Game" to anyone espically when the games it clams to be based off are vastly superior, even now Swat 4 is a better game, a 2004 game is better then this, even Swat 3 is better because it's AI was at least competent as far as team AI goes, IE: Checking corners by leaning.\n\nAnd the biggest culprit of all to this bad game is the devlopers who blame their community for "Not being hardcore enough" they don't even have the gumption to admit their game is severely underdevloped compaired to the games they "Based" their game off of.

The game was not finished prior to launch and it remains laden with bugs and missing/broken features.  Serellan (the developer) was never able to get dynamic shadows to function properly, even with the help of the game engine's developer, so the game's lighting is a bit off.  Physics are a joke, characters do some strange things when they're killed and ragdoll physics take over, and the resulting odd behavioir is probably the only positive thing about the game because it might give you a laugh.  Artificial intelligence of the enemy was "better than Chuck Norris" ridiculous when the game launched, and friendly AI is borked in the opposite direction, effectively eliminating any sort of "tactical" feel to the game.  It plays like a really bad knockoff of a really bad game.  Spend your money on something developed by someone that is capable and willing to produce a quality indie title.  Setting $15 on fire and watching it burn would be more entertaining and worthwhile.\n\n* NOTE: It appears the new Steam tagging system is subject to heavy censorship/moderation.  Every negative "popular" tag seems to have been scrubbed.  Do publishers & game developers have a say as to what tags are ok and what must be removed?

If man does not have perfection, it will strive to one day create it. Such is the pursuit of happiness. When pleasure takes presidence in the human mind and perfection has been sought for a millenia, what beautiful creation may be spawned?\n\nMan made a gem.\nA ruby.\nA radiant pearl in the depths of sorrow and distraught.\nA gleaming beacon of hope in a dark sea of dissatisfaction.\nA flawless painting that picques the picassos.\n\nMan made Takedown: Red Sabre.\n\n\nAn enigma wrapped in golden silk, Takedown draws you in with its deep character customization, and limitless combinations of weapons and attachments. At the main menu alone, I was at first overwhelmed with the flood of paths I could begin on. Luckily for us all, the God-crafted tutorial helps to soften the blow of the numerous gamemodes and maps. With a simple and stylish interface, Takedown takes you for a ride, yet holds your hand and still kisses you during it, whispering words of encouragement as it occassionally nibbles at your ear.\n\nOnce in-game, you'll find the stunning realism to it all. After my first kill, I balled up my fist and held it over my mouth, turning from the screen. Moisture tickled the corners of my eyes, and I found myself shaking without end. The sound of the bullet, the scream of pain, and the thud of a lifeless being left me sighing in distress. For a moment, I truly believed that I had taken the life of another human being.\n\nAs you slowly make your way from corridor to corridor, you can almost feel the weight of your armor bearing down on you. Your comrades are with you though, and the bonds you form with one another will follow you until you exhale your last breath. As time progresses, you feel much like a spider, spinning beautiful gossamer to create an oh-so fragile web of emotions with your squadmates.\n\nRick "The Stick" Flick is a wild card, but has a soft spot when it comes to those he cares about. With a family photo in his locker and his locket, he's commited to those he brought into the world, and gentle with the woman he loves more than himself.\n\nFeanus is emotional, quick to anger, but a loyal man regardless. His friends come first and that's the bottom line. Bullets or bickering, nothing will ever tear apart a bond that Feanus has built up. Known to be a bit fiesty, he keeps his pipop up on the front lines, and never lets his anger interfere with whatever mission is at hand.\n\nLaffy Taffy is a quiet man, tired of the war he's endlessly fought, both in himself, and on the battlefield. An honest soldier trying to get by, he always seems to have a mission to be done, and a task for his gun. Although he seems little more than a melancholy soldier, Laffy Taffy has an easily brought out smile, and a grin that can turn the world jovial again.\n\nAnd then there's you. Will you make a name for yourself? Will you put your life on the line over and over again and see to it that your loved ones see tomorrow? Will you take arms and fight for your brothers, your family, and your home? Will you gun your way through countless murderers, terrorists, and thieves to rid the world of filth?\n\n\nTo be honest, you probably shouldn't.","February 17, 2014","false","2.7"," 87 of 102 people (85%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","85","87","102","4","9"

Unfortunately, the game failed to live upto the hype, which was promised by the developers, as being a realistic tactical FPS. In almost every area of the game it's clear to see that the game was rushed with apparently no time spent whatsoever for polishing or improving the game before it's release.\n\nIn terms of gameplay, majority of the game is actually there but it's poorly implemented. Enemies range from being completely unaware of you to being deadly accurate. The friendly AI is almost completely lacking, which makes singleplayer completely unenjoyable. However, the game's core mechanics are in fact there, which means that there is a small amount of fun to be had if you choose to play the game with friends. But be aware, there is no way to create private matches and there are no online games available at all at the time of writing this review. If you can live with some 'small' niggles such as the unbelievably slow walking speed, the fact that any height can kill you and the AI the game is playable but it just doesn't live up to what the developers promised.\n\nThe level design is one of the few aspects of the game that appears to have been properly thought out with levels that feature tight hallways and open spaces which might create a tactical FPS if the game's mechanics were equally polished. The graphics aren't terrible (on low settings) and even lower end machines should be able to handle the game pretty easily.\n\nOverall, Takedown: Red Sabre is largely unfinished but might have some potential to live up to it's promises if someone took the time to finish it and give it the polish it desperately needs.","October 5, 2014","false","2.7"," 93 of 111 people (84%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","84","93","111","3","0"

The enemy AI is oblivious. It never seems to respond to sound or much of the happenings in the environment.

Yes, several vague objectives are posted in the form of a style-over-substance video overlay, but their possible locations, numbers, and significance are all still left unknown or murky. A realistic estimation of the cloud of combat and the limitations of simple surveillance? Not really, seeing as all three of these aspects are sensible targets of approximation during the inevitable observations that occur prior to sending in tactical teams...Right? A simple, pre-mission map with rough outlines and selectable routes would be wonderful, as would some form of dialogue between squad and commander to answer any lingering mission details.\n\nOn the topic of missions, the actual mission objectives, considering Red Sabre's apparent tactical roots, are surprizingly bland and simplistic in nature, echoing the desires of a standardized checklist, rather than the actual SWAT operations they wish to emulate. Missing are the dynamic hostage rescues with captive/captor dialogue and potential loss of life due to the explosive nature of such echanges. Even compared to the earlier SWAT series, Takedown's missions are devoid of the atmospheric tension maintained through periodic use of covnversation and ambient comments.\n\nThen, when actually playing a mission, several basic capabilities are absent, namely squad manipulation and regular status updates. In place of a context menu or other useful method of commanding your team, a simple hold toggle and ROE wheel are offered, both of which obfuscate the all-essential room clearing, as your team is always behind you, in turn rendering useless the more elaborate levels with their multitude of cover and choke points, as your teammates will never actually take strategic positions or utilize flanks, and complicating simple matters of spacial awareness as our mates tend to vanish when not verbally announcing enemies, their virtual minds dead set on maintaining unnecessary radio silence. The ability to investigate, both physically and visually through your squadmates: rooms, towers, corners, windows, doors, would be a monumental improvement, as would simple formation and movement commands.\n\nThis brings into light, your squad's strange lack of communication. Yes, the AI announces spotted enemies, but that's seemingly the extent of their communicative ability. Positions, actions, general side-chatter, are all absent, replaced instead with a wall of silence and death. While the latter is more a subset of mood setting and tone, the former two topics of conveyance are important aspects of movement and firing maneuvers, as proper placement of suppression and flanking teams must be confirmed before performance. That, and the awkwardness of having to spin your character around to check their periodic status, when enemies are everpresent, is painful. The movie, Way of the Gun, provides a fun example of firefight communication, as do several article by dslyecxi, a founding member of ARMA's ShacTac.\n\nLastly is a breakdown of the player's ironically standard moveset, given the advances in recent game design and Takedown's desire to be both modern and tactical. The player is limited to a digital lean, without a stepout or means of truly examining corners and bends, two digital stances, without any real cover system, nonexistent damage modeling -foot shots are instakills, and strangely simplified gun mechanics. As stated by its own developer, Red Sabre's crippled lean was intentional, but as demonstrated in RavenShield, fully analog leaning and stance change are possible, and with a reticule present -reticules being a sensible representation of the mental focal point one references when looking around and not the fabricated, game-world only gimmick some make it out to be btw, returning fire is possible so long as the weapon is locked to the view, an equally sensible representation, given SWAT behavior. The application of such a system would allow for full realization of the environment, window avoidance, and improved surveillance, aspects only improved upon by a fluid cover system, one that allows, at least in its most basic form, temporarily full coverage from fire, as shown in Red Orchestra and even Killzone or Perfect Dark, but in a more advanced form, with some manner of controlled cover migration. Exemplified in games like Receiver and the aforementioned Orchestra, gun mechanics can be rather complex without seeming overwhelming, so long as they're presented intuitively. Ammo checking, magazine management, individual component manipulation, bracing have therefore all been implemented in the past and have helped in pulling player skill and concentration away from reflexes and placing them on planning and execution.\n\nAlong with several prevalent, submitted glitches, involving firing, aiming, and stance freezes, I hope the above mentioned points help illuminate the fact that, while not the horrid abomination some have made it out to be, Takedown: Red Sabre is at its best underdeveloped and at its worst, unfinished, statuses that could effectively be remedied via patches and/or modding.\n\n\nLooking into the history of Red Sabre, it would seem Takedown's developer, Serellan, started a KickStarter to create a certain type of product of a certain calibre, and after raising a fair amount of money -over $220,000, released a product of subpar qualities, even after praising their own past experience and ability. That's just frustrating and unprofessional.","October 11, 2014","false","3.1"," 67 of 85 people (79%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","79","67","85","5","0"

Personally, Rainbow Six Rogue Spear was among the first games i ever played.\n\nThe game was funded on kickstarter with a goal of $200,000. Alas, it didn't live up to its expectations.\n\nFirst of all, it's not really that tactical. In Rainbow Six and SWAT you could review the layout of the level before starting, listen to the briefing, take advice from specialists etc. You would get a roaster of units to choose from - all having their portraits and biographies. Not only were those games tactical, they were very atmospheric.\n\nIn this game you are just walking around as a nameless 3D model. You cannot command your teammates (other than basic follow or stop), you cannot switch to them, you cannot even choose their loadout.\n\nHonestly, the only bond between these games is the fact that everybody dies easily.\n\nSecond of all - it's very low on content\n\nIt has like only 5 missions to offer, and about 8 primary weapons and 3 pistols.\nLoadout customization is kind of bugged. Also, personally, they have this thing - every scope except for holo or ironsight has a disturbing zoom in effect. Really a bad design choice in my opinion.\n\nBecause of that it's really frustrating to use them in close combat, and considering your dumb AI teammates, you would have to do everything yourself, and use them as extra lives.\n\nYou would have to fight in close-medium-long range combat, all by yourself.\n\nEnemy AI, despite being deadly and being able to shoot you down in 1 shot, aren't that clever themselves and will happen to miss you at point blank range.\n\nMultiplayer and coop weren't working for some time, and when they did, they game died out. Really, i think $200k is just not enough to fund something worthy of being called a spiritual successor to Rainbow Six and SWAT. The game was made on Unreal engine. Additionally, they probably spent quite a lot of their budget on weapon licensing.\n\nOn top of that, the pricing of the game was only 15$. In the end, the game has too many problems that need to be fixed. It's not really superior to the rainbow six or swat in any way, even graphical. They really nailed that "everybody dies easily" part, but the rest - enemy AI, game's depth, content, some game design choices. All of that really bring it down.","November 18, 2013","false","2.3"," 58 of 76 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","58","76","0","0"

Where to start? First Single player is a no-go because your team "AI" is 100% ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. they react in slow-mo and always end up dead in seconds. to make matters worse the enemy AI all have aim-bot, as soon as they see you, they hit you and mainly in the head or other critical areas.\n\n\nThis alone makes single player impossible and boring as heck. The next thing you will notice is the sub par visuals and animations. you walk as slow as a turtle and even when sprinting you don't go that fast. once while leaning out of cover the game starting auto-leaning my player left and right, left and right. i had to shut it down and restart for it to stop. other times my screen would go red and blurry for no reason at all, once again only going away when i shut the game down. the weapons sound like crap, and even the animation for the guns is horrible. you'll feel like you are shooting a paintball gun not a colt M4 Carbine that the US Marines use.\n\nTo make matters worse the game seems to have been set up to be released in Early access version, but then later for some reason the Devs decided to call it a day. what prove do i have of this? well other than the obviously un-finished gameplay, there is a folder in your steamapps called "Takedown Red Sabre Early access" . what more prove that the devs are desperate to sell this game? well, with each purchase you get TWO copies of the game that's right two for one! except the game still sucks, the only way i could see this ever being a reasonable purchase is if you get it for a Dollar or lower.Do yourself a favor and don't waste $15.99. if you need even more prove of how bad the game is just check out the reviews on steam. they ain't pretty,"Red Sabre was the single biggest disappointment of the past 2 years for me"  "They sold an unfinished game, but advertised it as finished" and most of them start along the lines of "STOP, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!"  and it has a 2.6 Metascore based on 126 reviews.  seriously, spare yourself the horrors of this game.","March 13, 2014","false","2.6"," 44 of 55 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","44","55","0","2"

First, the game is empty, nothing to do, the game-play is like a 1995's game, 2 monkeys lock in a room can do better in only 10 minutes....\nWhy i have really angry again the devs ? Because he told ''That will like be SWAT4'', He take the name of a awesome game to make people believe in his game, so he get money from a crowdfunding, and stop after....\nFor now, he clearly say the game is canceled, but still in sale in Steam, still people can mistake and bought the game, If its wasen't a scam, the game would be already removed....\nFor me, that one of the worst game i played in my life, even Delta Force 2 (1999) is better !\nIf you are looking for a great SWAT game, play SWAT 4, that game is awesome, even the server are down and still no steam edition....\n\nCe jeu, c'est pas difficile, C'est une arnaque pur et simple, pourquoi ?\nDéja parce que le jeu n'a rien, tout simplement, quelques map, quelques armes, bref 2 singes enfermer dans un bureau ferrait mieux en selement 10 minutes....\nPourquoi je suis énervé contre les devs ? Pour avoir dit ''Le jeu sera comme SWAT4'', Prendre un nom de jeu comme ça, attirer des gens, pour ensuite faire un crowdfunding, ramasser de l'argent, et annuler le jeu derrière....\nEt maintenant, le jeu est clairement annuler, mais toujours en vente, encore une preuve d'arnaque, le jeu aurait déjà été retirer si ce n'etait pas une arnaque...\nC'est l'un des plus mauvais jeu auquel j'ai jouer, Delta force 2 est largement mieux (1999)\nSi vous cherchez un très bon jeu de SWAT, je recommende sérieusement SWAT 4, Ce jeu la, au moins, vaut vraiment le coup !

There is no mission map, no planning method, no meaningful squad control (only to shoot, or not, or hold posistion), the enemy AI always sees you while your squad MAY see them, all glass (from my experience) seems to be bullet proof, and suppressed weapons will still draw a lot of attention. i could go on but this game is pretty awful and there seems no inclination to fix it.\nImitation is the most sincere form of flattery but I am pretty sure that UbiSoft and Red Storm would have rather not had this title try to emulate their well crafted game.","July 10, 2015","false","1.4"," 20 of 22 people (91%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","91","20","22","3","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zenilant/recommended/236510/","zenilant","Zenilant","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zenilant/","370 products in account","Takedown: Red Sabre does not feel like a finished product. The performance is horrendous yet calling the visuals "basic" would be putting it nicely. No settings can be changed in-game and all adjustments must be done at the main menu. There are only three levels of visual detail to select from and changing this requires a full exit and restart of the game. Beyond the rudimentary presentation there is a shortage of content and what's there barely feels like a game. There is a training mission that feels half-finished, and the rest of the missions make little effort to give any sort of context into the situation. You are simply thrown into arbitrary settings to kill unidentified enemies with perfect aim suffering from braindead AI to complete objectives that are never really justified beyond a simple briefing. Movement is stiff to a fault, weapons lack panache, and performing any action just feels awkward. The online multiplayer is unsurprisingly a ghost town and the handful of missions are no fun to play in single-player anyway. Even if you're still longing for a return to tactical shooters the likes of SWAT 3/4 or Rainbow Six, Takedown isn't what you're looking for and as much as you may want to like it the game is sure to disappoint.","February 9, 2015","false","1.5"," 18 of 20 people (90%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","90","18","20","2","0"

It does have a long list of problems. Like, surprisingly bad for a game based on Unreal 3 Engine. The controls are clunky. The AI is clumsy on pathing, but very good on reacting to your sound (light armor and light gun make all the difference in CQB maps because of noise more than mobility/muzzle length. The AI of your teammates is almost non-existent, and incredibly disappointing, considering Christian Allen's pedigree.\n\nThe interface is god-awful and forgets maps your selections every time you finish a round. It appears to forget your loadout selections too, but it doesn't (though sometimes I select a loadout and it doesn't work)\n\nAnd multiplayer? Well, no one plays this game. And if you try to make co-op multiplayer work, you'll find it won't connect without a whole lot of troubleshooting (use Tunngle.)\n\nAll that being said, it is challenging. The bots don't mess around with their aim, and react very well to any noise you make (if they don't fail at pathing) When I first started playing, I felt proud if I could kill 20 people before I died. And without unlocks in the game, it lends itself well to having this kind of challenge and not being frustrating. I've had some really classic moments playing this game, and it can get REALLY intense at times.\n\nI have logged 29 hours in this game, and I still haven't beaten Cargo Ship or Facility. I still really like playing it!\n\nBut... it's currently at a low price and it's a great deal if you want a challenging Tactical FPS. The bugs don't *break* the experience, but it helps to go into the purchase expecting to get a game that feels like it's still in Beta.","February 7, 2014","true","39.3"," 97 of 162 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","97","162","0","0"

At £3.99 I wasn't expecting a masterpiece of game design, and I was fairly happy with the mechanics etc. It's a small scale game which doesn't require any real time commitment and you can pick it up and put it down as you please without losing any of the experience.\n\nHowever, there are game-breaking bugs such as crashes on loading screens. I've yet to come across anything that restarting the game won't fix, but if you aren't prepared to deal with this kind of thing (which is of course perfectly reasonable) don't buy this game. Personally, I don't really mind. Although like I say, people have every right to complain about it, as you're paying for a working product and getting something which doesn't work as it should.\n\nSo, in summary, I quite like this game as an idea. HOWEVER, bearing in mind that really this is an unfinished product being sold as a finished one, I cannot in good conscience recommend this game.","October 31, 2014","false","0.9"," 21 of 30 people (70%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","70","21","30","2","0"

The AI was broken in never before seen proportions (I remember a video I saw once upon it's release last year where the player shot at the side of an enemy an unsilenced rifle, only to receive as an AI reaction: nothing... after that, he shot in the same place his SILENCED pistol, only to receive as a reaction: the AI turns around and clunkily shoots the player, killing him.) Thankfully it has been heavily patched, but the AI is still painfully broken. An issues is that once you spawn on the map the AI know your exact position and some (not all, of course) enemies will rush your spawn point. For tactical FPS stealth fans like me, the classic Rainbow Six fanboy, this is a dealbreaker for the game, immediately removing your will to complete it's 6 maps.\n\nyes, it has *only* 6 missions. Half of them are boring (the ship at night is an outright copy of the 2nd mission of Rainbow Six: Rogue Spear from 1999! and it's done REALLY poorly!)\nThe prize you get for completing the mission is: nothing! Sense of completion is next to nil thanks to the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ AI that wins is numbers, not in smarts, the clear aimbot they have also make the game unbelievably easy sometimes and other times a boring chore of unfair difficulty ON THE SAME MAP! It's not balanced properly and it feels like you are playing according to the game/AI's mood rather than testing your skills in a tough but fair game like Rainbow Six! The devs seemed to have dropped out of high-school because they don't have a ♥♥♥♥ing clue on how light reflection and refraction through a basic glass window/door works in real life and thus, in a video game!\nThe textures are muddy and bland. The game looks from 2007 (and even then, PS2 titles from 2007 like Black (absolute masterpiece, go play it whenever you can!) look BETTER! A PS2 GAME!).\nThe story is literally non-existant, even other tactical shooters like Rainbow Six: Rogue Spear (again I'll mention the date of Rogue Spear's release to embarass this game: 1999!) had a coherent (though, basic) and good enough storyline!\n\nThe gunplay is ok, I suppose, guns have nice recoil, though the handling is clunky at best: Even with a full magazine you can reload your gun, which is weird and pointless. The reload animations are outright terrible, just watch somewhere the M4 and it's variant's reload animation (which is the same) and then have a few laughs and publish that on Facebook or something, that will make someone's day, escpecially if that someone is an avid gun-nut.\n\nSound design is bad as well, lighting effects are abysmal (your flashlight only lights up a circle in front of you, light doesn't ♥♥♥♥ing suffer dispersion through the air or refract through glass, again! The devs got their degree at a Starbucks warehouse...), everyone know air is made of particles and gases that disperse the light into an omnidirectional radius (the flashlight should illuminate in front of you, but also stuff near and at your sides, because that's how dispersion and basic reflection physics work!), right? I'm looking a bit pretensious here, but it's basic physics, everyone should know that!\n\nAlmost forgot about the music! It doesn't exist! Only 1 action-movie-generic song nº1003530 at the menu and that's it.\n\nFinally: The loadout system, it's broken! It doesn't save ocasionally, and it doesn't tell which button saves, because there isn't a "pick loadout" option, only the "change loadout" option and you have like 5 loadouts, so when you start your mission, pray you get the one you want! It's incredibly random and After 4 hours, I still have no clue on how to change it, whenever I want to change, I press everything, every combination possible and it outright does not work! (If anyone know, plz tell me, thanks in advance!) The game lacks, giving the player basic guides or ideas, the grenade throw is clunky at best as well, with an abstract bar telling the force of the throw. The grenade doesn't respect basic physics' laws at all either!\n\nI was STILL going to recommend it (it dropped from 13,99€ to 4,99€ a while ago, with a 4-pack costing now 14,99€), but I just saw E3 and its recently announced title "Rainbow Six: Siege", which looks MILES away better than this! So much that I am now telling you to not buy this unless under 1€ and/or wait for R6:Siege to bring back old-school great tactical FPS goodness back to gaming, such tactical greatness that gamers haven't witnessed being well done since Rainbow Six: Raven Shield from 2003!\n\n4/10, it's fun for a while only... ultimately comes down to you!\n\nSMALL EDIT: R6:Siege is looking so ♥♥♥♥ing terrible lol. I advise you to get Insurgency or Rainbow Six 3: Gold Edition on steam. You can pick both up for 20€ or on a sale for a combined total of about 5€.\n\nI am so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ disappointed O_o Siege looks so bad! Looks like the Tactical FPS genre isn't coming back any time soon...","June 10, 2014","false","4.7"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","0"

I got to play now the comunity was usually a buch of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s I was open to them and they became very anti new players and drove me away and disscouraged playing with them, this completely ruined the game which could have been good had there been a faster walk or sprint function because It was far too slow, So if your looking at buying this game I strongly Disscourage that you wont get your time out of it and you'll regret playing it! and the people you play with are just rude and make the game even worse!","September 27, 2014","false","0.3"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","7","8","0","0"

If you can manage to convince it to run, the prolonged character customization will trick you into believing this is actually a game.  It is not.  It is the distilled essence of failure, wrapped up in shiny labels and an appeal to an underserved market cynically crafted to to con as many people as possible out of their money before they have a chance to see it for themselves.  There is nothing good about it.  The AI is awful, the guns feel like Hasbro toys if they were dipped in molten lead instead of paint, and the graphics are somehow uglier than much older, theoretically less advanced games.  The only good thing about it is that it has the good grace to crash frequently, sparing the user from having to play more of it.  I pre-ordered it, played it, and then gave up and uninstalled it before forgetting about it until now, desperate not to remember this horrible product.  The only thing that could save it would be a refund.","August 11, 2014","false","0.1"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","88","7","8","5","0"

Alright, I'm gonna just go jump in right away to the movement, now you might be asking,"What? The movement? Why is that?" Well, the reason for it is because there is 3 MODES of running, 3 MODES! Now you might be saying,"3 Modes of running? I thought this was a FPS Shooter not a Racing game!" I thought the exact same thing. You have walking mode, which is slow as hell, then you got running mode which only increases the walking by the smallest bit, and to do so you hold SHIFT, and lastly, sprinting, which increases your running by a lot, now the funny thing is the way you sprint is that you have to hold CTRL, yes, CTRL. Why would they even have running if you can just sprint?\n\nAnyway, the next thing I want to talk about is the recoil, the recoil on every gun on this game is terrible, and I am not just saying that, the bad recoil and plus the bad movement combined are making the gameplay for this game terrible.\n\nNext is the servers, alright, so after doing the terrible tutorial, I went to have a look on some Multiplayer servers, I only found around about 4 servers that were up, 2 had hardly anybody on the server, and the other 2 servers could only manage a player limit of 14 players. I joined the server, to my surprise having no music. I also had a objective to do, which was to defend something, while also trying to plant a bomb (Gee, doesn't that remind you of a game?). The game acts like Arena Mode in Team Fortress 2, where if everyone on one team dies, they loose, no respawn. I found the maps to be the exact same just with different textures, and each map was as confusing as the other. It took me 4 minutes to actually find a enemy, and when I finally did, the player would kill me in a near instant, not giving me a chance to do... really anything. And with the the small amount of players on the server, the rounds went quick.\n\nAfter Multiplayer, I gave a go at Singleplayer, hoping that I could get trained, because at the time, I thought it was me that was bad. The AI on Singleplayer was horrendous. Your teammates would basically follow you and shoot any enemy in their sight. Another thing was that when you died you turned into one of your teammates. Now, the enemy AI are scattered around the map, and If you try to open a door and a enemy is on the other side you have no chance of survival, since bullets basically instakill you in this game. Takedown: Red Sabre! Around 5$ just to get this game is not worth it. I would rather recommend Black Ops 2 than this terribly programmed game.","February 23, 2014","false","0.6"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","7","8","0","0"

I remember back during initial launch it was almost impossible to join friends. It was plagued by awful AI and many problems. I relaunched it recently to see if anything has changed, and if it was playable. Well, it's playable, but the AI is still the absolute worst. I almost want to call VAC bans on the AI, due to their aimbot nature. And your team AI is absolutely laughable. When they aren't doing crouches because they missed leg day, they're mindlessly standing behind you staring at your back instead of actually functioning like a team. Given that you respawn as the next member of your squad if you happen to die, if that member happens to be standing right in the way of enemy fire you're going to die in 1 ms. Now repeat that two more times until game over.\n\nThe presentation of the game initially seems nice. The voice acting is alright and the UI in the lobby is decent. Once you load into the map though, everything becomes lifeless and silent. It doesn't feel like anything more than assets pieced together with poor AI.\n\nIt had a vision and initial promise, but the game failed to achieve it, and now we wonder what it could have been.\n\n(Oh, and it used to be sold for $15. Now it's $5, and I still think that's too much to pay. Get it at less than $1 or avoid it completely.)","March 31","false","0.9"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","7","8","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Drist/recommended/236510/","Drist","Chao","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Drist/","233 products in account","Let me just preface this review by saying I wanted to enjoy this game. I really did. A hard, realistic fps was something I enjoy, and have been looking for different simulation fpses since I picked up a copy of Arma: Cold War Assault. So I was pretty excited to try this out, especially since I got it so cheap. What I got, however, was so subpar, I had a hard time making it to an hour played before turning it off and telling myself I was simply done. While I do not enjoy speaking so poorly about games, especially one that I spend such little time on, I have more than seen enough to warn against buying this game.\n\nThe Good: Plenty replay value\n\nThe Bad: Clunky controls, barely-functional AI, sub-par graphics\n\nPremise: To put it simply, Takedown: Red Sabre is as unfinished as an Alpha test. The entire game falls short in almost every aspect of play.\n\nStory: N/A\n\nMechanics: The controls feel slow, sometimes unresponsive. A few times during play, I would swap weapons and it still have my primary out until I clicked to aim down sight or shoot or I would lean and then move, only to be stuck leaning until I leaned the other way and be trapped in some wierd continuum. As a testement to how unpolished this game is, the sprint has no animation, at all. Gunplay felt off, as well. Handguns feel like extremely weak airsoft weaponry. While every other weapon in the game usually felt normal, I couldn't help but feel that there was too small a selection. And the class-like system? Kinda a joke, considering weapons aren't restricted to a certain class.\n\nSingle-player: Being a tactical fps, you're given four squadmates (or less depending on the mode), which are all of equal use: none. You cannot give them orders, and they're literally so stupid, they cannot function on their own. The squadmates tend to alert the enemies by standing in the open, even if you're behind a crate or a wall. Aside from this, their aim is usually slow, which ends up in them being killed off. This becomes a problem when its so easy to die, and while you take control of an AI after death, there's usually no use trying. Often, I took over just to be gunned down by the exact same enemy because the AI positioned themselves directly behind me. More often than that, the AI would have hp in the red, meaning there would be no surviving another shot. Its also no help that the enemy AI is incredibly unbalanced and incoherent on difficulty. Some AI are stupid while others will try to flank. Often, however, you will crawl around a corner or up some stairs to be gunned down instantly as if the enemy had an aimbot. This can cause some extremely frustrating gameplay.\n\nMulti-player: From the singular game my client could find (even after checking the server list), the game played quite the same. However, the unintelligent squadmates were replaced by players. Though they used voice chat, the lag was so terrible that every word came out choppy. As far as I could find, there was no scoreboard, so it was impossible to tell who was dead and what everyone's pings were. After dealing with the choppy-voiced insults for a couple rounds, I decided that I would much rather stick to the equally frustrating single-player portion for abit. When I tried to play multi-player again, no servers could be found and I gave up on that portion of the game.\n\nGraphics: The graphics were far from on-par with latest games in the genre, which is understandable as the studio was relatively unheard of. My PC may not be the best by far, but CSS looked better than this game, and still ran twice as well. However, they were not terrible to look at, except on the lowest setting.\n\nFinal Verdict: The game is good for about 15 minutes, then the reality of the purchase sets in. The normal $5 asking price isn't high, but its still way too much for a game that "released," but still feels like an early alpha test. I would not advise anyone to buy it unless you have the cash to burn.","May 1, 2014","false","1.3"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","1"

I wanted to believe so badly that this game would be fun despite bad reviews, because the tactical shooter was my genre, and ever since its downfall gaming just hasnt been  the same. So i buy the game, thankfully on sale, get into the screen and the game crashes. Ok.. start again and go to my loadout screen. After about 5 minutes with the sluggish ui and bland selection i save and go to start a game and the first thing i notice is there is no campaign. Ok... so i decide on the first map, thinking chronologically. The game just loads up, no team loadout screen, no planning phase, not even a whiteboard diagram of the building were assaulting. No intel to help decide on loadout. Ok... Start the mission and the weapon i have is not what i picked at all, it was the basic mp5 starter setup. WTF... Decide to play on, start scouring the keybaord to find some team controls...... none. Not only can you NOT control your team, but they sem to work against you. I went down the stairs with them and apparently noone was checking our six, since when I got to the bottom i noticed noone was following me. I go back up the stairs and see my 3 teammates all flat on their faces, with a tango just standing there not even noticing me. A perfect metaphor for the state of this game as well as the integrity of the devs. And after i back out i find it goes on and on. You cant see or access your loadouts from anywhere but the games main menu,\nNo ROE or any tyoes of control, no idea where youre going or what your doing, Crashes every time I play it.

[KAMGUSTA's REVIEW]\n\nI am one of the few guys that got the game KNOWING how bad it was, just to be sure it was bad for real. You should be happy knowing that I wasn't disappointed!\n\nI think this game should be played by every developer out there just to let they know how to NOT make a game. When your boy come home from school with a bad score, buy him this game and force him playing for a full day: it is a harsh punishment. But let's talk about the negative points:\n\n1. Graphics is more than horrible, I have seen better GameCube games.\n2. Changing gun and reloading it is slow as hell - this is not an assault team, it's a physical impaired team.\n3. Enemies are dumbest than a brainless monkey but still they can hear you from 6 rooms of distance and can teleport near you without damage.\n4. Online is dead: 4 server, 2 of them are empty and 1 has an outdated client.\n5. People playing it are a**holes: I have been teamkilled 2 seconds from the start, no report, no warning, no kicking out, no penalties.\n6. Even only spectating a gameplay does led to bugs!\n7. The developers knows how bad it is: they give you 1 free copy for every purchase. It seems like they wanted to say: "sorry for buying it, we can't fix it, please take this gift and give it to your worst enemy".\n\nPlease do not let my play time count fool you: I only managed to play this game for 20 minutes, then I left it idling for cards (steam trading cards is the only positive point of this game).\n\np.s. The response to the first question is: "after playing this game, it has been lowered".\n\nBest played with Monitor Off\nRecommended Buy Price < 0$\nScore 2/10","March 1, 2014","false","1.5"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

After playing for only 5 minutes on the first real mission, my weapons dissapeared an I was unable to switch weapons, shoot, etc., resulting in my needing to restart the game.\n\nAfter playing for about a half an hour I have put together a list of issues that the developers should tackle (A list that should have been tackled before putting a pricetag on the game!!)\n\n-Gamepad support isn't great.  There is no sprint via controller.  I haven't tried going into controls and manually mapping every key to a controller button, but why should I need to?\n\n-You cannot select options while in a mission!  this is just poor game design.\n\n-After leaving a mission, the next time you go into the mission menu it has 'training' mission selected.  It doesn't remember the last mission you played!  This would take 5 minutes of programming to fix.\n\n-The AI is borderline ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.  Both your crew, and the enemies.  I like that you can tell your crew what to do (offense/defense, hold/follow) except it is easy to lose track of them.  Not sure if there is a minimap, can't remember, but I don't think there is.\n\n-When you die, it takes a solid 3-5 seconds before you're put into a different member of your crew.  This should be fairly instantaneous, I've watched my whole crew die after my first character went down, when I could have swung one of them around to kill the enemy. (again, if they weren't so derpy, it wouldn't matter.)\n\n-The default settings for movement are annoyingly slow.  Your character pretty much crawls, unless you hit 'shift' to run, or 'ctrl' to sprint.  Buried in the menu options, you can switch run and walk (which should be the default).  now that I found it my character moves at a reasonable rate, and I switched sprint to 'shift', and if I really feel the need to walk (crawl essentially), I have it bound to 'c'.  Crouch was moved to 'ctrl' which should have been the default.\n\n-graphics are glitchy and laggy.  Really annoying if it happens right when you engage an enemy.\n\n-The game advertises itself as a 'thinkers' FPS, but is really like Rainbow-Six IF Rainbow-Six sucked.\n\n-I'm sure I could come up with many more bugs/issues/poor design choices, but i'm not sure if I can bring myself to play anymore of this game.  Maybe I'll play it more just for the trading card drops, so I can at least get some of my money back.\n\n-Also, the first mission you are sent in to a biological weapons researcher to help save their company from being exposed.  Why the hell would I be motivated to help a bio-weapons lab?  I wanna be part of the crew that takes those inhumane SOBs down, not helps protect them!\n\nI really don't like to be so harsh on a developer, but this game shouldn't be for sale as-is.  Change the tag to beta, release it for free to get some notes such as the ones above, and do your job as programmers!!!  1.5/5 stars","February 22, 2014","false","0.7"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","1"

I love tactical shooters, but wow have they got some work to do on this title. The lack of any radar or standard crosshair is a huge problem, but I suppose that was their intention given the 'hardcore' nature of the game to begin with. Even still, it doesn't help matters. Furthermore, movement seems glitchy and don't even get me started on the 'run' and 'sprint' functions in this game... unreal. Careful, going down a set of stairs at the wrong angle could prove to be fatal. Fall damage is outrageous in this game. Enemy AI is everything from oblivious to fully aware, ready to flick shot you as you stealth your way towards them. Talk about rolling the dice on this one. That just about concludes my rant on this game. You'd be wise to save your money and pass on this. As a takeaway, I hope the developers get a better understanding of these issues and patch in some serious fixes as the game matures.

Maybe they fixed a lot in the new patch, I wouldn't know as I just started playing it. AI isn't genius but it isn't too terrible and is just challenging enough to make each game interesting. AI's spawn at start instead of at triggered locations which is something I missed from the old Rainbow Six games. There is a lack of weapons which hopefully will be added later on but it is by no means a game breaker. Also the MP5 (M5 in game) is much more innacurate than it is in real life. I enjoy this game quite a bit all things considered. The M4 and ACOG (Combat Optic) are both well done, better than I've found in many games and I know this for a fact since I got a lot of experience with both during my time in the military.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/yij/recommended/236510/","yij","Yij","http://steamcommunity.com/id/yij/","391 products in account","Short ReviewA supposed comeback for the tactical shooting genre, Takedown: Red Sabre passes selection and completed his training courses, yet when it came to his first real mission, he flopped… Big time.\n\nPretty much the bare basics of a tactical shooter. Awkward menu, horrible AI, mediocre game mechanics and glitches abound. But decent graphics and great level design.\n\nKiddie Steam reviewer verdict: “chnged gun. started game. gun didn’t change. Wnt back. changed gun. game still dusnt register change. carried on. ai squad gt stuck in door. Saw enemy across map with back turned. He turn round and killed me in half a second. Tried multiplayer. Uinable to connect 2 any server. 4/10 wud disconnect agen.”\n\nLong ReviewIt’s no secret that games these days are all about your waist high walls, linear objectives and regenerating health. Answering the cry of help from the tactical gaming community, a few industry veterans (who’s work involves that of Ghost Recon, SWAT and Halo) stepped up to the call and decided to create their very own game to resurrect this dying genre.\n\nGraphicsThe graphics range from excellent to quite poor. The environment textures look absolutely fantastic and whilst a bit too clean and sterile, offer a pleasing amount of colours and contrasts that make it an absolute shame you have to shoot up the place. It’s a shame there’s no peaceful mode as I would have loved to explore the excellently crafted map.\n\nThe character models look fantastic! Boasting high polys and great texture work, each character looks like a real life operative who’s been kidnapped and transported into the Unreal engine (bless their poor souls). The character and model artists really know what they’re doing with this one. It’s a shame that characters move like they’re made out of wood and lack any idle animation, resulting in a game of musical statues. I don’t even know if they can blink.\n\nOn the downside, the weapon and first person view-models look like they were pulled from a game 5 years ago. Much lower poly than you’d expect so appear rigid and angular, plus they also house a number of bad faces that reflect light at odd angles. When you have a stunning environment with life-like character models, but have to stare at your blocky arms and firearm that looks like it was made out of tin foil, it’s pretty jarring to say the least.\n\nSoundThe music is pretty good, definitely sets the mood with its militaristic theme. Whilst there isn’t a wealth load of tracks, they’re all done to great effect and tie in well with what you’d expect from a tactical shooter.\n\nAs for in game sound, well there isn’t much to talk about. Everything seems eerily quiet and doors opening, soldiers screaming, spouts of gunfire is all you’re pretty much going to get. Whilst the guns sound ok, they sure sound generic and lack that looping variation you’d expect from games like Rainbow Six or Ghost Recon.\n\nGameplayTakedown: Red Sabre has come a long way since it’s behemoth of a disaster at launch, but sadly it’s still a sordid buggy shell of a game.\n\nThe menu is basic but seems glitchy at times. Often I’d try to change my equipment, only for it to not register until I realised you have to click on the kit name (recon, assault, etc), then click “save loadout” then click back. At least I think that’s how I did it.\n\nYour AI squad waddles behind you like a group of duck, refusing to follow any sort of tactical formation, either choosing to form a conga line or dancing all over the place like frightened cockroaches in a matchbox. Very much like your first puppy, outsides of asking them to follow, sit, attack or stay quiet, there’s pretty much no other use for them except extra lives should you bite the dusts. Moreover, when you get killed in a doorway, they enjoy running straight into the doorway and getting capped themselves.\n\nThe enemy AI is just as bad. Running around like headless chickens, staring at a shiny wall instead of that door you just blown open… then managing to do a 180 spin and headshot you from across the other side of the map in about 0.23 seconds. Cheap.\n\nI have sadly never ever been able to participate in a multiplayer match, thanks to a wide range of “connection problems” and error messages. Having played prior to writing this review, I’m still getting unable to connect to server messages and I still cannot get a LAN game to run.\n\nMovement is a little odd as you seem to slide everywhere. You can’t lean very far nor move and lean (which apparently is due to quote “The realistic nature of the game”) even though you could do so in most other tactical shooters.\n\nAsides from the terrible AI and connection issues, there is a game here, it’s just very barren. It has its moments of enjoyment and if you can accept the complete package for what it is, it’s not the end of the world. If somehow you manage to win the lottery and spot a pig flying in the air at the same time, get the multiplayer to work (if it still does) and playing with other people should make the game more enjoyable.\n\nFinal WordsTakedown: Red Sabre is a huge disappointment. Whilst it’s not an absolutely terrible game, it’s far far from a good one either. Having trashed the game on a public article and being called out for having inaccurate info then told by the game developer that many problems have been solved, bottom line is many many problems still remain. Where’s my multiplayer?\n\nAs for the company behind Takedown: Red Sabre, they’re making a new tactical shooter called Epsilon. The question is, should you support them? I think so!\n\nThey’ve seemed to have learned from their mistakes and putting all efforts into their new title. I’ve gotten my hands on the alpha and for the price of a 6” Subway, it’s given me great bang for the buck. Still, a few bad lemons are bound to pop up in a box every now and then, so I urge you to check Epsilon out.","February 17","false","4.5"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","67","8","12","3","0"

After buying it I bought one for my brother and we both love tactical FPS games and this really hit home for us, it was a great addition to add multiplayer co-op. It's intense and requires a lot of teamwork, so what if the graphics aren't "Crysis" it is still really enjoyable, I do not regret buying it.\n\nYou don't die to easy, it's realistic, do you really think that the enemies would hire dumbasses without training?

Honestly, this game has absolutely no redeeming qualities. It's like playing Devil May Cry on Hell and Hell difficulty the first time you've ever played a melee-POV action game without being able to use Ebony & Ivory or Rebellion. You are punished heavily for using weapons via the recoils and you are constantly put in situations where you have threats from multiple sides and die before you can see all of them. My biggest qualm with this game is that you die in a single shot while wearing a fully armored combat raid suit and the stealth they are oh-so-focused on doesn't mean a damn thing.\n\nTL;DR: Don't buy this game.","January 17, 2014","false","0.6"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

You will actually feel like you are a real member of a special tatics team.  You get to play by yourself, or with up to three other team mates, either other human players or AI who actually act as though they were really special ops not just random 9 year olds spraying down hallways.  So if you can manage to get three serious people together you can have a great time simulating a real special ops team or team in general.\n\nThe game is really well designed and also, I'm pretty sure I mentioned this already, it's also really realistic.  You can create up to four different classes or presets with different gear.  You can also pretty much customize anything you could ever want!  You can pick your primary weapon and a secondary.  Your primary will pretty much be any weapon you could ever want.  You got rifles, single shot, burst fire, AND fully automatic, you got shotguns, you got it all, but no silly rocketlaunchers or grenade launchers as those would be both unneccesary and unrealistic for the missions you would be taking part of.  Your secondary will usually be some sort of pistol or a light weapon.  On top of choosing your own weapons, you can also pick attachments like different ironsights/scopes, and if that wasn't enough, you can also select different ammo (yes it matters), so be sure to have the right ammo for the right mission.  Then you get different equipment you can bring, I'm not going to bother listing them all but you can choose from a large assortment of grenades, you got claymores, you got all tons of stuff it's like a terrorist's dream come true.  I almost forgot to mention this, but you can also pick different armour or protective equipment that actually effect your gameplay, like it will make it so you can't run as fast or for a long amount of time if you have heavier equipment.  On top of that, you can even put a nice little patch representing whatever country you want on your sleeve.\n\nNow when you got your presets set up, you can pick either Singleplayer or Multiplayer to try them out.  I don't really want to take up too much of your time talking about the amazing thing called multiplayer, so in this review I'm only going to talk about single player.  First of all you get to choose which type of mission you want to do, from tango hunt to bomb disarment.  You'll get your mission briefing at the start of the mission and you can pick an area for deployment.  After that it's the same deal as most of those "army" or "special forces" shooters (cod, moh, etc.), where you'll go through the mission, but it's not like them at all.  You don't have that ridiculous red border to show that you're dying, you'll actually feel like you're dying and then eventually if you don't start to get serious, you'll be dead.  You also won't be picking up any of those silly health packs or other  nonsense pick ups.  The only things you'll be picking up are guns from the people you kill.  The enemy AI is also not like other typical games, where they just always miss and are totally oblivious of your presence.  They will hear your gunshots, they will hear your footsteps, they will call for backup.  Unless you get with the program you will die.  I'm not going to ruin the suprise of what happens when you manage to beat a level, that's an experience you just have to experience yourself.\n\nWell this review for this great game was a bit longer than I inteded it to be so I'll stop soon.  I'm going to start capitalizing every letter now to put emphasis on my next sentences.  THIS GAME IS A MUST BUY GAME, IT IS PRETTY MUCH A STEAL TOO.  IT'S SOO CHEAP I DON'T KNOW WHY EVERYONE DOESN'T OWN THIS MASTERPIECE.  THIS GAME HAS IT ALL, GUNS, EXPLOSIONS, RADIOS.  I HONESTLY DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE I COULD ASK FOR IN A GAME.  THIS IS THE MOST REALISTIC SHOOTING EXPERIENCE THAT YOU CAN POSSIBLE EXPERIENCE WITHOUT ACTUALLY BEING IN DANGER.  I CAN'T SAY THIS ENOUGH, THIS IS A  MUST BUY GAME !!!\n\nI'm pretty sure I forgot to mention some things, but I hope you get my point.","September 13, 2014","true","34.5"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","5","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/digitaldebaser/recommended/236510/","digitaldebaser","ResetPatrick","http://steamcommunity.com/id/digitaldebaser/","236 products in account","Reading through Takedown: Red Sabre's Kickstarter page may give the impression that the game is a spiritual successor to classic PC shooters like Rainbow Six and SWAT4. Instead, like Tom Clancy's imagining of the submarine Red October, the threat of this game engages the player with little to no warning.\n\nThe idea behind Takedown is a throwback to the classic era of PC tactical first-person shooters, but the desire to perform any form of tactic is tossed aside to make way for frustrating gameplay, unrealistic AI and disappointing physics. My first playthrough began with a member of my team relentlessly crouching and standing upright in an endless wave of teabagging while enemies sprayed bullets in our direction. Squadmates often stand in place like cardboard cutouts as enemies assault only to suddenly become active and return fire a few seconds after combat begins. I've had some enemies outright ignore me for nearly a minute after I accidentally sprint into them. Grenades bounce off of objects and sometimes launch across rooms as if they were thrown onto a trampoline, and enemies sometimes launch into the air or soar across a room when killed.\n\nBad AI is Takedown's most crippling issue. Explosions don't tip them off to enemy presence. Flashbangs seem to be low-grade sparklers to them. They would rather stare at walls than pursue enemies and they often choose to shuffle around in a circle before engaging the player. Enemies can sometimes spot the player seemingly by looking through objects, yet they sometimes walk by a door where the player is in plain sight without a single reaction.\n\nThe game's graphics are very rough, and the overall visuals look incomplete. Some weapons lack fire animations. Enemies look like an alpha build of characters from a mid-2000s game instead of a product from 2013. Anyone expecting top notch, or even acceptable, graphics from Takedown will be disappointed. Areas in a single mission often look recycled and uninspired. This can become especially troublesome if you become lost and can't remember what floor you're on. Most other shooter games would have the player press the “M” key and dissolve the confusion, but there is no key to bring up a map in Takedown.\n\nStage objectives are challenging and fun to attempt, but the frustration from bad AI and no map assistance kills the mood. Some objectives like “destroy PC disk drives” are entirely too obscure. I discovered how to complete this objective by aimlessly firing in an office for no reason and struck a PC tower by accident. A room filled with large, standup computers was introduced before the office room was, so I was frantically trying to discover how to destroy these disk drives. The player normally interacts with objectives by holding the shift key, so changes in how objectives are completed introduced a great deal of confusion.\n\nPlayers may choose to customize layouts in order to choose primary and secondary weapons, grenades and breach charges; but customization often yields little change. I never felt like using a different weapon mattered much. The true difference came when I chose scopes over red sights, but I abandoned worrying about either after shooting enemies spot on in the abdomen only to have them scurry away unscathed and aimlessly charge up and down flights of stairs. Flashbang grenades leave enemies unharmed and hardly alert. Nearby explosions from frag grenades resulted in enemies staying in the same position, admiring the walls that enemies often stare at rather than reacting like a person would.\n\nTakedown offers Mission, Bomb Disarm and Tango Hunt modes of play. Bomb Disarm and Tango Hunt could arguably be more enjoyable than Mission, but the same issues haunt these alternate modes of play. These modes are made worse than Mission because a player's squad is reduced to one. It then becomes quicker to be killed, quicker to be overwhelmed by several bad guys so one random shot can instantly kill the player, and quicker to realize that the noise suppressor accessory for the weapons is garbage. If the idea behind Takedown is to be a spiritual successor to old games like Rainbow Six or other tactical, team-based shooters, then the idea of reducing a team to one to defuse bombs or to take out an enemy team is absolutely befuddling.\n\nTakedown: Red Sabre is a good concept's stage show of poor execution. The project's potential can certainly be felt and understood, but the likeliness of such potential surfacing – even through patches – is low. To call the Takedown project lazy would be harsh, but it wouldn't be inaccurate. The goals for this project were laid out in the open both in the Kickstarter campaign and on the game's official website, but very little victory can be tasted in this final product. Couple a disappointing experience with a $14.99 price tag, and you have arguably the most disappointing video game to be funded by a Kickstarter campaign.","December 25, 2013","false","4.4"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Having worked with UE3 before their lack of knowledge on basic engine functions astounds me. Furthermore the game simply refuses to work in MP and SP will often disconnect you for no reason. There is no VOIP and the game lacks any steam community functionality at all. The menus are a mess (e.g. they don't allow you to change options while in game) and the entire thing wreaks of a project that was pushed out the door because the devs realized there was no salvaging the project. This might be worth 5/10 if you can actually connect to play with friends otherwise i'm giving this 1/10 for actually being able to run but other than that this is a game in pre-alpha state.","September 21, 2013","false","1.8"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

You will die often, and a lot, and your teammates will die as well, because the AI in this game is a better aim than Wild Bill. The only way to play is to predict where the enemy will be based on where they were last time, and spray wildly in that direction. I say wildly because your aimed shots will miss just as often, especially with the heavier calibers, even on single fire. I get the feeling whoever made this didn't spend much time actually firing weapons, as recoil generally is well compensated for by the body, it's kind of why guns have stocks and so on. Professional shooters utilize techniques such as wrapping their arms through the weapons siling to further minimize the effects of recoil and to tighten up aim. None of this is reflected here.\n\nI bought it knowing it would be bad, but it's not "so funny you can laugh at it" bad, it's just "Oh, the guy that's been on the screen for a few milliseconds headshotted me, and his burst killed two of my teammates" bad.","January 8, 2014","false","0.9"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Within a month, it dropped to about 16 players on average and is has been an average of 7 players ever since. according to Steamcharts[steamcharts.com].\n\nAs of this writing, I just logged in to see if I could get a pick-up game (even though the game-play is rather buggy and miserable). What I found were two game modes with no servers and no players. I found one game mode, deathmatch, which had one twelve-player server . . . with zero players.\n\nIt has the base components for a game that could be decent, with a whole lot of work, time, and many iterations. Unfortunately, with a player-base big enough to stuff in a phone booth, it is unlikely that anything is going to come of this game.

I came back to this for almost 15 hours because it was kind of fun to see if I could complete any of the missions despite...well.  The innumerable problems with the game.\n\nSo, fun aside, I have no idea how Serellan took an existing game engine (Unreal?) and managed to make it do things like lose the connection to the host while playing SINGLE PLAYER or not have a working game browser until several patches in.  Extremely basic design decisions are poorly done:  how might you handle weapons loadouts?  Customize before each mission?  Not in this game!  You chose four loadouts from the main menu, differentiated only by their names, and then chose those by name (what did I make the Assault loadout again?) when going into a mission.  (EDIT 12/27:  oh joy!  You can edit the loadouts at the mission jump-off screen!  But you're still editing the four choices...then choosing one.........idiots...)  Your team members never changed weapons, so the one guy was always carrying a sniper rifle, even through urban hallways.  That might've mattered if the team AI did much more than absorb bullets or mutter things like "rounds downrange"--you have basically no control over them except to ask for them not to follow you, and even if they're supposed to sometimes their pathing will fail and they'll get stuck.  Ultimately, they were only useful as extra lives--except that their loadouts couldn't be customized, so eventually YOU were the idiot stuck with the sniper rifle while trying to do CQB.\n\nI wanted badly for this game to be good, but it wasn't.","December 27, 2013","false","16.2"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Well for starters, how about the fact that the game has ♥♥♥♥-all in regards to PC Settings as most of them seemed to be lacking, especially  like the  Display Settings where there is no options other than, Screen resolution and graphics settings of :Low, Medium, and High.\n\nThe controls are somewhat ehh...I mean the sensitivy for the mouse feels rather slow for a game that expects you to have the reflexes of that of a cheetah, even at full sensitivity.\n\nLeaning is rather useless as all it really does is bend side to side from the waist up instead of, you know, LEANING WITH YOR ENTIRE BODY, making looking around corners more of a hassle than it needs to,so I practically don't even use that feature at all.\n\nWeapon damage is rather inconsistent at times as at times 2-3 shots to the chest will be enough, while sometimes you can shoot point blank at someones chest with no armor, with BUCKSHOT, and they'll still keep chuggin.\n\nThe disturbing absense of Squad Commands feels very wrong for a "Tactical Shooter". I mean Squad commands have been present in most if not all Tactical shooters, and no I don't count Halting Your Squad mates, and just saying random phrases like "Going on Offensive" or "Going on Defensive" as being as remotely helpful as it generally does nothing, hell even Ghost Recon: Future Soldier had Squad commands! And that was more of a action third person Shooter!\n\nAnd the above problems don't help when the AI is rather inconsistent...what do I mean by that you ask? Well when the Enemy is so stupid as to stare at a corner all day, looking in the absolute wrong direction they should logically\nexpect you to be coming from, walking directly past you even when you are firing point blank in their face, to being so alert as to know that you were to come out through a door on a balcony after killing one of my squad mates on the bottom floor, shooting me in the face with disturbingly accurate accuracy in one shot, when logically there was no reason to know I was going to come out from there, HELL, sometimes the enemies will know I'm behind a door, even though they didn't hear me, or see me going through the door yet...seriously are some of the enemies psychic?\n\nThe same also applies to your squad mates too. If they aren't really hyper aware and getting really accurate shots killing the enemies really quickly, they are either NOT shooting the enemies and are just shouting that theres an enemy soldier coming right at them, while they are looking Straight at them, not firing a bullet, usually resulting in very crappy and hilariously awful deaths, or WORSE, getting you stuck in a corner, keeping you captive until you put a bullet in one of their skulls, which surprisingly they don't retaliate for.\n\nThe Graphics is...Alright, it at least looks serviceable at High Setting, but the worst thing about the presentation has to be the animations...I mean, I get some serious X Operations vibes just looking at them walk, it's just un-natural.\n\nand after all that, was there anything good about this game...well, I liked the fact that you had to be mindful of how long your weapon is in consideration to the walls adding a layer of strategic thinking, but even with that...no, I have nothing really good to say about this game...\n\nThe most cardinal sin about this game is that fact that this game was released in a very poor, and rather unfinished state. Like most people have said, it does feel like an early alpha state game...the lack of modes and maps should be an indication of that, and the fact that Serrellan after all the money they got on kickstater, and then getting partnered with 505 games to puplish the game, and to just release the game, in THIS state, is just un-acceptable.\n\nIt's so dissapointing to see such potential go to waste, as the guys at Serrellan obviously were proud of this game, and work was put into it.\n\nLike I said before, this game isn't as awful as some people make it to be, but would I say it's good, no...\n\nIf I had to give a short review of this game, I would simply put: "Takedown: Red Sabre is like a dumb 4 year old eating crayons....it may seem adorable, but it doesn't cover up the fact it ♥♥♥♥ it'self."","December 10, 2013","false","3.7"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

It wants to be like the old Rainbow Six / Ghost Recon games but did it reach its goal? To make it short: ♥♥♥♥ING NO!\n\n\nNegative Points\nBugs\n- This game has no bugs, it is a bug! (and I dont talk about insects..). Seriously this game is so broken!\n- Random game crashes are common, random frame drops are very common and you have to restart the game to fix this.\n- Bugs like glitching through objects, animation bugs or bugs when you switch the weapon are so common that you think that they are "features".\n\nAI\n- Ore collectors from C&C Red Alert are real brainiacs compared to the AI from this game.\n- Player detection seems to be totally random. Sometimes the AI see you behind the doors/walls or detect your from all over the map and sometimes they just ignore you even when you stand directly in front of them.\n- AI uses aimbot and wallhack. This is so much fun.. not!\n- Team mates are totally ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and dont react to orders.\n\nGraphics\n- Not the worst but far away from good.\n\nMultiplayer\n- Connection problems, lag, no fun!\n- Totally dead by now.\n\nGameplay\n- The game react so slow to your keyboard input (or sometimes it just ignores it)\n- You die so fast and you cant heal yourself.. no fun especially with the hacking AI!\n- Hit detection, shooting, walking - everything feels so wrong.\n- There is no "tactical gameplay". You can just hide, lean around a corner and pray that the aimbot AI dont instantly kills you.\n\nSound\n- Cheap\n- Character voice lines often switch between german and english..\n\nMiscellaneous\n- Most weapons, most attachments and all body armor beside heavy armor are completely useless.\n- The menu sucks, configuring your loadout is a pain in the ♥♥♥.\n- You cant jump.\n- Fall damage is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t!\n- Time limit from 60 minutes.. lel\n\n\n\nNeutral Points\nGerman translation\n- Not sure if I should cry or laugh about the horrible german translation.. they should have used google translator for a better translation.\n\nMaps\n- The design of the most maps is ok, you got different ways and different spawnpoints also different map themes.\n- Not many maps.\n\n\n\nPositive Points\nNone\n\n\n\nConclusionThe game had potential but the execution was done sooo badly.

Please god no, not another five minutes of this game. THis game is so utterly appaling so smug in it's own failure that it needs to be taken down from Steam.\n\nBut first let me spin you a little fable.\nOnce upon a time there was a bloke named wolfthing, he had enjoyed one or two of the Rainbow Six Vegas games when he was younger but felt things were missing, like I dunno, TACTICS. Then he learned about SWAT 4 and this made Wolfthing happy, sadly it's not available for legitimate digital download anywhere and as Wolfthing was screwed over by pirates once, he won't pirate it. In his brooding he discovered Takedown: Red sabre and apparently so did one of his friends, who gifted him the game, Wolfthing was happy. Until he pressed Play. After a good 20 minutes of online shennanigins and about 15 of single player crap he quit the game and uninstalled it, creating a new category in his library marked "Horrible, So Horrible"\n\nNow that the scene is set, let me open with this.\nTHIS GAME IS COMPLETE AND UTTER ♥♥♥♥ FOR THE LOVE OF GOD\nDO\nNOT\nBUY\nIT\n\nSo about 3 minutes after clicking play I have some issues already, the menu is ♥♥♥♥, like worse than cheap console port ♥♥♥♥, the options aren't the worst I've seen but they leave much to be desired. So I go to join my buddy and I can't. Eventually we find eachother on a public server. Now begins my 20 minutes of online play. I think it's best to describe my thoughts at the time rather than attempt to actually review this.\n\n\nOk these controls are pretty slow, I guess it is tactical. Oh look I can open doors, but all the rooms are copy pasted, I haven't seen anyone yet, oh hey a bad guy no that's just my reflection, well this is boring, I'm out, peace.\n\n\nYeah, pretty bad, the single player is much the same except the enemy AI sucks ♥♥♥ for a living, it takes a good 2 seconds at least for it to react and any ♥♥♥♥♥♥ can react to him in that time, they never surrender and have deadeye aim when they finally do wake up, meaning you will be insta-killed. Speaking of killed I suppose I should point out the game's only good feature and elaborate on it so I seem fair, when you die to switch to one of your squadmates, it's a brilliant idea and I can't remember PLAYING another game that did it, although I think one of the Brothers in Arms games did. It's great if you need to speedrun a level in order to get through a ♥♥♥♥ game as fast as possible but in the end I gave up anyway.\n\nThe story isn't a story it's a set up, and it works fine. You are a squad of a special forces division of a morally ambigous private military corporation. Basically people hire you to go in and shoot the bad guys before the Police get there and find the Illegal weapons you've been developing for sale to Private states, or the Government as the case may be. And this works fine, it means the game can skip some corners on the whole protocol thing that the SWAT games did. It does mean however with it's gritty black ops feel, you ask yourself why is there an army of deadeye terrorists (Who are apparently just some kind of Pro-humanity protest group in one mission) and noone is taking precautions to stop them?\n\nSadly the game missed out on some base management stuff which I feel would've been kind of cool, having to manage staff, equiipment, the Public opinion, your secrecy and your profit, but that would've required extra work.\n\nWork is something the devs seem to have a paralysing fear of as they have released an unfinished game claiming it finished. It's not even a beta it's a ♥♥♥♥ing dev-build they released at 0.8914 or whatever the ♥♥♥♥ it is.\n\nSeriously don't buy this game, it's ♥♥♥♥ on frozen ♥♥♥♥ pie. I couldn't even play it for an hour. I don't really like scores in reviews but I'd give this one 0/10 and then add a million zeroes to the 10. Then triple it.","November 25, 2013","false","0.8"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","1"

Everyone said that it was ♥♥♥♥ and a huge disappointment and that it was a waste of even the $1 that it's worth even now on Steam.\n\nHowever, there was one guy who posted a screenshot of his playtime in the game (about 26 hours iirc) and said that everyone itt was ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and that it was actually fun. This guy singlehandedly convinced me to buy it anyway and ignore the circlejerk.\n\nI'm very glad that I did.\n\nDuring my first 3 hours of gameplay I decided to write a list of +s and -s about the game, coming at it from a low-expectation and is-this-game-like-rainbow-6 perspective.\n\nspoiler alert: it was exactly what i hoped it would be\n\nThe following is my list of +s and -s about Takedown: Red Sabre based on my experiences with the game. I am a very old school Rainbow 6 player and I came into this game with very low expectations due to the Total Biscuit review (and later PSA), random internet people's advice and opinions about the game.\n\nOne thing I want to be clear about here, though, is that I am not the kind of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ who gives a ♥♥♥♥ about cosmetic ♥♥♥♥ like sexy reload animations, graphics, et cetera. Imo all of these things are completely fine. They're not as good as ArmA 3 or Skyrim but they don't take away from my experience at all.\n\n---\n\nWhile checking this game out and making this list, I fully was wearing my Rainbow 6, Rogue Spear, SWAT 4, and Raven Shield hats and I try to make direct comparisons to each of those games as often as I can in this list for you:\n\n(these are in the order I wrote them down while playing the game)\n\n+ Level editor (not even Tribes has this) is exactly like the old Raven Shield one (because they're based on the same engine), which is way ♥♥♥♥ing better than the old Rogue Spear one. This is a huge plus for me because I love making custom ♥♥♥♥ in games and then playing them with my friends.\n\n+ 3 game modes across 13 different maps by default (however the Mission game mode limits the pool to only 5)\n\n+ Mirrors and glass in general actually ♥♥♥♥ing works -- there are genuine reflections that you can use to see people around corners, such as when on the top floor of the Biolab where you can see enemies under your feet by looking at the tall windows.\n\n+ Gimping works just like in the old Rainbow 6 games.\n\n+ AI is just as good at shooting as you are (assuming that you don't suck at crosshair placement and aiming), but only when they're alerted to your presence. It's exactly like Rainbow 6, except instead of multiple difficulty settings (Recruit, Veteran, Elite) each AI has its own difficulty settings. Some are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and cowardly whereas others are 360 noscope mlg xxx tier. Either extreme is very rare (maybe 1 per mission) and most AI are probably in between Raven Shield's Veteran and Elite difficulties imo.\n\n+ Atmosphere is just like the old Rainbow 6 games (e.g. rooftop biolab insertion feels exactly like the Raven Shield Penthouse insertion zone).\n\n+ You die in 1 hit most of the time unless you equip heavy armor, in which case you can take 2~5 hits. This is exactly the same as in each of the old Rainbow 6 games. It depends on where you were hit and the caliber of the gun that the guy who shot you has. HOWEVER, unlike in the old Rainbow 6 games, when you wear Heavy armor you are not allowed to sprint (default: LCtrl) anymore. imo that's completely fine.\n\n+ Hit detection on narrow edges (like shooting through doorways at tight angles) are exactly the same as in Raven Shield -- presumably because they're built with the same engine.\n\n- When you die, you don't get any feedback about your stats or whatever (e.g. accuracy, how many kills you got, et cetera).\n\n- There's no indication of how many enemies in total you're up against. Because of this, you can easily get bored running circles around the map searching for the last guy.\n\n+ The game can only be done slowly, so it's just like Rainbow 6. imo, it's even slower than that, though -- I'll explain why I think this later on down this list.\n\n+ The relationship between accuracy and movement feels exactly the same as in the old Rainbow 6 games (but it goes out the window when you scope in or use ironsights, which did technically exist in the old Rainbow 6 games because you could still zoom a little even without a scope anyway -- it just didn't look like that once they introduced first person weapon models in Raven Shield).\n\n- It lacks certain functionality that people consider "basic" or "essential" nowadays (e.g. being able to change options while in the middle of a mission) but weren't exactly taken for granted back in the old Rainbow 6 days. Most ♥♥♥♥♥♥s on the internet seem to judge a book by its cover, so to speak, and so they look at this lack of "basic" functionality in the menus and just drop the game completely and tell everyone it ♥♥♥♥ing sucks. In my opinion, people who do this can go suck a ♥♥♥♥.\n\n- TotalBiscuit complained about how there are only 3 graphical settings in his review videos, but tbh I don't care because I get 60fps on my old laptop with Medium and Low settings... and all 3 settings don't take away from my gameplay experience at all so imo he's just nitpicking on that point, at least).\n\n+ It *FEELS* like I'm playng a modern Rogue Spear game, except the pace is slower (tbh Rainbow 6 and Rogue Spear both were very fast paced in terms of movement and it wasn't until Raven Shield that they slowed it down, which I loved personally... but this game slows it down even more while still letting you run and sprint through clear areas at the old Rainbow 6 and Rogue Spear running speeds, so I'm 100% cool with this and won't list it as a minus).\n\n+ Sound *ACTUALLY MATTERS* in this game, similar to how it matters in CounterStrike (although for different reasons). The AI will even hear you if you so much as switch to your grenades! In my opinion, this is a huge step up from all of the old Raven Shield games. Whereas in the old Rainbow 6 games, you can run around with Heavy Armor and it makes no significant difference to how the AI detects you... in this game you can actually see very easily how the AI reacts to your movements, even through walls and doors. All of this makes the gameplay slow down even more, which makes me much happier personally because that's how tactical shooters are supposed to be played in the first ♥♥♥♥ing place!\n\n+ You can choose multiple insertion zones both in Single AND in Multiplayer. In the old Rainbow 6 games, you could only do this in a few special missions for single player... but *NEVER* for multiplayer. This is a big plus for me because in Multiplayer you can divide your team into actual separate groups that start in completely different areas of the map.\n\n- There is no 2D map or anything for the missions you can play. You have to learn them as you go. This isn't a big minus for me, personally, but it is definitely a minus. It means that only people with enough experience can actually plan ahead, which takes away from the fun for me. It adds a sense of exploration to the game, true, but I don't think that this sort of thing is appropriate for this kind of game.\n\n- No pre-mission planning phase at all. The old Rainbow 6 games never did this for multiplayer, of course, but it was at least there in Single Player. Ultimately, though, it's not that big of a deal I guess but I'd still like to be able to do it in both Singleplayer and Multiplayer. It only adds to the fun of the game and doesn't take anything away at all imo.\n\n+ There is a decent selection of weapons and gadgets (which is what the game calls grenades and stuff). You can't give yourself a High Capacity mag like in Raven Shield (thank you jesus I never liked that feature anyway back then because it made the gameplay speed up unnecessarily since you hardly ever had to worry about taking cover to reload).","December 28, 2014","true","23.1"," 50 of 95 people (53%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","53","50","95","9","1"

It turned out to be not just a disappointment, but actively repulsing. The AI is so terrible it's hilarious. Sometimes you shoot by their head with a .458 socom and they don't even notice you, sometimes you shoot one round of subsonic suppressed 9mm and 4 guys run from across the map to headshot you. Anytime you go into a room you risk being owned immediately if you do not throw in a grenade (which you have 4 max) or know where the enemy is ahead of time. Also the AI teammates have a pitiful selection of commands compared to SWAT 4 and Rainbow, they have like 4 RoE commands. Supposedly the AI has been "updated", but I can't imagine it being any worse.\n\nThe game has crashed on me 4 times in an hour of play and I constantly have to restart a mission because the game doesn't save my loadout correctly, which gets annoying.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/AWACS-Jason/recommended/236510/","AWACS-Jason","AWACS","http://steamcommunity.com/id/AWACS-Jason/","110 products in account","This game was not worth 1.50.\nI should have never sold my cards to buy this game, it's not even a real tactical shooter. It's a slow paced shooter with several tactical elements, like.... walking very slowly.\n\nThere is no fluid door opening, and if you open a door, you are more than likely going to die unless you place yourself at a wall. The options for this game are absolutely horrid. At max sensitivity, I still feel incredibly sluggish, making me want to throw up. Literally.\n\nThe AI are as dumb as bricks, but they have an insanely fast reaction time ( wut? ).\nOccasionally, you'll be able to kill 20 enemies with ease, due to how stupid they are, but sometimes, you will be insta-killed by the game by an enemy who will use only about 0.2 seconds to shoot you. This is coming from someone who has fast reflexes and good aim. Not to mention, when you do actually get shot at, you will shot in the head. This happens 90% of the time and it makes the medium and heavy armor types very useless.\n\nThe equipment options in the game are very basic, you get a frag grenade, a flash grenade, and a breach charge. The flashbang usually doesn't work, as terrorists seem to be completely normal ( By shooting me in the head ).\nThey don't retreat from frag grenades, oddly enough... But the grenade physics make them feel like rubber balls.\nBreach charges are generally useless, as the AI will either open the door on you as soon as you put the charge there, or... There won't be anyone in the room.\n\nThe mission variety in the game is pretty awful. There's only about 5 different missions, and this game was released several months ago.\n\nThe community is either non-existant, or extremely stupid TKing trolls. You get 1 of the 2.\n\nThe friendly AI is extremely stupid, worse than the enemy. You get terrible command options over them, and you are unable to seperate them and tactically manage them. You can tell them to follow you or watch a certain area, which barely works. You can't have 2 guys watch the door and have your sniper on the roof, because there is no way to tell them to get into a specific location.\n\nThe weapons and damage in this game are REALLY weird. For a tactical game, it's weird how you don't even have to aim to accurately hit a target. Aiming is useless in CQC, you have a better chance to charge and strafe. And when you do aim, you can literally strafe left and right ( ADAD Spam ) and dodge most bullets. Except from the guy who instantly headshots you.\nDon't put weapons into full auto, just put your weapon in single shot and click as fast as you can. You can get much better accuracy and less recoil, while killing targets in 1-3 hits.\n\nThe enemy AI in this game is really immersion breaking. ( If you wanted that kind of thing ).\nThey seem to charge at you DIRECTLY ( Not heading towards cover ) or, they run away from you and do a 180 and headshot you, then retreat again into a random corner.\nThe AI doesn't patrol around an area, engage in conversation with other AI, or do anything.\nTheir only goal is to wait for you and to kill you. Being stealthy in this game has no benefit, most of them will somehow know where you are anyways, and then instantly headshot you. Surviving a bullet is rare, especially since armor isn't protective.\n\n\n(RECAP)\n\nThere isn't a real story in the game, so that's a negative.\n\nNo planning mode. A minus on the 'tactical' side of things.\n\nNo advanced room clearing tactics. Just open and peek in until everyone is dead.\n\nExtreme lack of AI commands.\n\nDead Community, about 40 players at MOST. I'm pretty sure Star Wars: Battlefront 2 has 180 players at most. Which is extremely sad.\n\nExtremely sluggish controls, including mouse sensitvity.\n\nExtremely barebones options menu. Extremely barebones menu in general.\n\nVery slow-paced, but not tactical.\n\nNot fun, or engaging. Instead of being intense, this game is more than likely going to make you rage.\n\nBuggy. ( After several months )\n\nHuge lack of content.\n\nTerribad AI.\n\nUn-immersive. No cool features either, like a tactical map or an overhead picture you can draw on or a planning mode.\n\nLack of customization. Pick your guns, what armor, what you want on your patch, and what equipment. That's it.\n\nCompletely random crashing and connectivity issues.\n\n1/10    -At least they tried-\nActually, I don't even know if they tried, they seemed quick to place the game on Xbox Arcade.\n\nI recommend that you buy Rainbow Six: Raven Shield instead of this garbage.\nIt's a much older game, but it's also much more fun.\nEspecially with friends, where as this game makes everyone just get angry at each other until everyone leaves.\n","February 12, 2014","false","3.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It turned out to be not just a disappointment, but actively repulsing. The AI is so terrible it's hilarious. Sometimes you shoot by their head with a .458 socom and they don't even notice you, sometimes you shoot one round of subsonic suppressed 9mm and 4 guys run from across the map to headshot you. Anytime you go into a room you risk being owned immediately if you do not throw in a grenade (which you have 4 max) or know where the enemy is ahead of time. Also the AI teammates have a pitiful selection of commands compared to SWAT 4 and Rainbow, they have like 4 RoE commands. Supposedly the AI has been "updated", but I can't imagine it being any worse.\n\nThe game has crashed on me 4 times in an hour of play and I constantly have to restart a mission because the game doesn't save my loadout correctly, which gets annoying.

Bad guys go from not seeing you at all to sniping you with a slingshot from across the map. Oh, and they take out the entire rest of your idiot squadmates before you can even switch characters. Which leads me to...\n\nb) No squadmate commands. Horridly annoying with the AI as completely mentally handicapped as it is in this game. This means you can't even use your blind/deaf/can't hit ♥♥♥♥ squadmates at scout fodder. It also makes any kind of tactics like what you might be used to in Raven Shield completely impossible.\n\nc) Horrid interface design. It's completely unintuitive and doesn't flow.\n\nd) Nagging Issues: Here's one -every single door on every map starts "open". Minor in the grand scheme of things but annoying combined with a and b above when a hostile snipes you through 5 bulkheads or doors that would otherwise be closed. It's worth mentioning because it demonstrates the complete lack of polish on this game, and this isn't the only example I could have picked.\n\ne) There are other numerous issues that individually aren't huge but combined make for a frustrating experience.\n\nf) The developer doesn't seem interested in addressing player concerns. For the longest time I remember every complaint was responded with "Due to the hardcore nature of the game...". It was used as an excuse for exceptional game-breaking bugs (like the aforementioned horrible AI).\n\nThe map design, overall, I thought was decent even if it feels a bit sparse or dated. A few of them are good enough I'd love to play them in Raven Shield. Frankly though this game just isn't worth it, and the developer doesn't seem interested in fixing it. This game is simply incomplete. I haven't dumped a lot of time into it and I have zero desire to bother again.

There are sooo many things wrong with this game. The menus and options screens are difficult to maneuver and clunky, the AI in this game is terrible, and the half the time you have no idea what you should do. The game just throws you into the menu, not really forcing you into training or explaining how to maneuver the menus to change character class or loadout.

This game also boasts pistol ammunition that can kill a man from ten miles away and AI that walk into walls, shoot mentioned walls and then have their bullets ricochet from the walls into you for one reason or another. This game is so awful that it can't help but be hilarious, and I'm glad I payed the $0.99 to get it while it was on sale. Would I buy this game at full price? No, but it was worth what I payed for it. Long story short: buy this game if and only if it's on sale; any price higher and I wouldn't recommend it.","July 23, 2014","false","6.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/almacov/recommended/236510/","almacov","Almacov","http://steamcommunity.com/id/almacov/","872 products in account","Takedown is a mess, but I've enjoyed the game nevertheless.\nIt's glitchy as hell, and the netcode is unreliable, but when I have played with friends online I've had fun.\nIt's a barebones experience. Do not expect a planning stage, or any team AI control beyond hold/follow commands and basic rules of engagement modification. The campaign is also short, and somewhat disjointed.\n\nThe fact of the matter is that this game was obviously in an Early Access state upon release (The install directory of the game even lists it as "Takedown Red Sabre Early Access"), and wasn't listed as such in the store. That was enough to deal a severe blow to what could have been a pretty decent little tactical shooter.\nAt this point, while I hope the developers will continue fixing and improving on their design, there's little incentive for 505 Games, the publisher, to fund them to do so.\n\nAgain, the whole situation is a mess, but as much as part of me wants to dismiss it wholesale, I can't say I hate the game.\n\nIt's brutal and unforgiving in the same way the old Rainbow Six games were, which is bound to be offputting to some people, but scratches an itch most shooters don't for me right now.\nShots can kill or seriously injure you very quickly, and there is no way to recover health.\nThe AI opponents have moments of startling cleverness, though most of the times they drop you will be due to not cursoring over them fast enough to evade their sometimes exceptionally quick and accurate weapons fire.\nThere's a tenseness to the action that would be lost if the damage model and AI were more forgiving.\n\nThe map designs are open and interesting, each one providing you with two potential "insertion points" which determine where you start. Some of the design is actually fairly visually attractive, though strange things like reflections that don't actually reflect the environment in a coherent way can slightly mar the experience. (Particularly in the "HQ" level.)\nDespite there being numerous doors on most maps that are purely decorative and don't open, there's a refreshing amount of freedom to how you approach each mission. The nonlinearity also scratches an itch I haven't had many first-person games reach recently. This isn't always player-friendly design in the sense of providing easy and obvious ways to progress, but I'm not sure this is a situation where one can have their cake and eat it too.\n\nHUD is rather minimal, and they go so far as to strip you of a crosshair. You can aim down sights, but that slows your movement. Recoil is extremely noticeable on most weapons, and really needs to be minded in combat.\nThese are traits that add interest to me, but could be deal breakers for some.\n\nWhat's most likely to bother people though, and rightly so, is that the game simply isn't finished. It's glitchy to the point that sometimes something as simple as switching weapons will lock you into a selection, leaving you twiddling your thumbs when the grenade slot you locked into runs out of ammo. Menus are glitchy and need to be minded, sometimes forgetting loadout changes (particularly the addition/removal of silencers). It's missing features as simple as text chat in game lobbies.\n\nDespite the fact that I myself have found enjoyment in the game, I can't bring myself to recommend anyone spend $14.99 on it - especially not when Rainbow Six 3 Gold, which is $5 cheaper, scratches all of the same gaming itches and has far more polish, depth, and content. That said, Rainbow Six 3 is more than ten years old and there have been too few games like it on the market since its release. This is a genre and style of gameplay that needs preserving, but Takedown just isn't offering enough.\n\n(As Serellan updates this title, assuming they do, I will update this review. As of the time of this writing, the last update was February 6th, 2014.)","March 3, 2014","false","15.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Still awful. Avoid like the plague, seriously.\n\n\nTakedown: Red Sabre is.. painful.\n\nIt fails as a tactical shooter. Planning is non-existent, there's no map in the briefing and no ingame map. There are no squad commands past "wait" and "follow". Your AI companions are basically extra lives for when you inevitably die. Flashbangs either don't work, or they blind you through a wall. There are no smoke grenades, or thermal goggles, so you're extremely limited in your options.

But the game, is, TERRIBLE, first off, when you play the training, its basic, you already know how to fit this game, the controls are standard, but serve no purpose. When you play your first mission, you will know what I'm talking about. The AI is too smart, smarter than your highly trained SWAT team you have following you like mindless zombies. When they see a bad-guy, they say Tango Spotted, so I tell them to shoot it, they just look at it though. The enemy AI always knows where you are. Your only intel is what the game gives you. You spend more time getting killed by super buffed pirates than you do killing pirates that aren't trained. If you're going stealthy, you'd expect that they wouldn't know where you are. But really, all they do is aim at you, until you come into the direct line of sight, then they start running after you.

Your team is clunky, ending up alerting the enemy before you can scope out the map, because you cannot make them wear different armor, or armor fit for what you want to do. The mission always wants you to go steath, when the mission objectives call for action. Your team always has silencers, when you don't even need them. Now I'm getting started on multiplayer. Half the time, you're on the team with a prick, who only wants you to hate the game you payed for, it's not even free, so they kill you with their insta-kill guns, wearing huge-♥♥♥ armor, so they kill the entire team before the game even really starts, then they kill themselves, because they're bored. Other than that the maps are too big for 6 on 6 team deathmatches. If you could have 12 people on each team, then it would be fair, and the match would be 90% more interesting, but it's full of boring experience.

The base mechanics of the game (assuming you can play it; I had to disable my joystick to prevent input interference that spun me in a continous 360 to the left) are promising: as a technology demonstrator this should secure future funding. Unfortunately the niche 'tactical shooter-simulation' market continues to play the old, proven games for very good reasons: Namely that they have content and they work reliably. This is not something that Takedown: Red Sabre (TRS) can boast. I have 0.7hrs of gameplay because the game simply refuses to start despite recent patches and I had to solve the competing inputs issue before I could review the base mechanics of the game. Graphics are as you seen on the screenshots, entirely satisfactory.\n\nTRS is missing a great deal: Storied, biographed team-mates, working multiplayer, mission briefings, a campaign, a planning phase, all of the things that made Rainbow 6 a remarkable series of games prior to its franchisement into ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ pap for consumption by mentally damaged children. There's no reason these features cannot be applied to TRS, save for the developer's sham development process.\n\nMake no mistake: TRS is at present one of the "work in progress" or "fund us as we go" games made possible by Steam's update distribution function. Such a development model was previously impossible for technical reasons, but for marketing reasons I think TRS will prove that it should not be adopted now that the technical hurdles have been overcome.\n\nMost of the early negative comments regarding TRS were from "railshooter" players who have never asked more of their games than a scripted cinematic experience with no replayability and largely, no challenge or critical thought required. These were unfounded negative comments. Subsequent commentary has focused on the incomplete and outright flawed nature of the game, and what Serellan LLC has done is take a dormant market hungry for new content and alienated it completely in the span of two months. Bravo zulu; you have now created the textbook negative example.\n\nDo not bother with TRS until vast, sweeping changes are made.\n15-10-2013.","October 15, 2013","false","1.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Why is is so cheap?\n\nIf I had to place a specific genre on the top of my list of games I want to play the most, it would have to be the "Sci-Fi Tatical Shooter" genre. While Stellar Marines isn't anywhere close to complete, I looked for something to challenge me in the mean time.\n\nAt the end of the day, playing isn't good enough. There has to be a challenge, and that is what seems to separate the two major classes of modern gamers. Games used to make you rage to the point of throwing your machine out the window (and not due to bugs!). Takedown: Red Sabre returns to these roots for the most part, which is why it was hyped up at the start.\n\nSo what about all the other reviews and metascore? Why are they giving the title a huge thumbs down? Well the key issue lays with release day. I had thought about purchasing the title on release day, but passed off wanting to ensure I wasn't wasting money on a buggy game. Good thing I did, bugs were everywhere in the game. People would disconnect from singleplayer games randomly, and the server browser didn't work. Rest assured most (if not all) release day bugs have been fixed.\n\nBeing a "hardcore" tactical shooter, it's not easy to beat. Playing by yourself is quite a trick, so bring friends whenever possible.\n\nSpeaking of friends -- to make the game enjoyable you should bring some. The game isn't VAC secured, and trolls will be in game sooner or later. Teamkilling seems to consist of a moral punishment, nothing more. There's no current system (2/10/2014) to get rid of them without knowing Unreal's console. An oversight for sure, mainly from the game being so cheap. And don't forget there's no private or password protected lobbies!\n\nThe game isn't complete, and shouldn't be advertised as such. The AI is very hit-or-miss, having naturally deadly aim the moment you open the door, but then stare at you in other cases. Flashbangs don't interact how they should, as AI don't seem to be "flashed" when thrown. The AI also seem to be unaware of any sounds, but then can somehow know you are outside the door.\n\nMaps are well designed, modeled after real life places that a tactical team might find themselves in. The key part is that the levels don't lack in openness. You have to be naked out in the open sometime, proving to be an almost instant death if you don't play it right. Indoor environments react how they should, but door handling with latency can be an issue.\n\nCould the game be more? For sure and without a doubt. Examples would be finer tuning on the Kevlar or bullet resistant gear (like where on the body), a prone position, or even a true clip/magazine system (a big must for hardcore). However, the title has to clean up the AI. In it's current state, it's not really hardcore, but it's getting there.\n\nOne way to clean the AI up would be to add group intelligence like that seen in Half Life 2. Squad tactics are shown on the human side of Takedown, but not on the AI side of things. It would be simple as adding code when an AI spots a human player, other AI join in the firefight. Just play the level called "Facility" on Co-op. You will see what I mean, the AI all act independently.\n\n\nSo there you have it. All the issues but good positives as well. This review is kind of odd being price dependent. I purchased the title for about $1.79. At that cost, I would happily slap a 7 for title. At it's regular cost, 6.5. With the odd handling somehow working out to make a hard game, it certainly checks the "different" checkbox for me.

The premise of tactical team-based combat ala SWAT and Rainbow Six is mouthwatering to any veteran team-player. With one of the key designers of the classic Rainbow Six games behind the helm it almost seemed too good to be true and unfortunately, it kind of is. First off i'll state the games has MUCH promise and the prospect of user generated content is fantastic, but the problem with Takedown is it lacks character and style its predecessors had. It feels very generic and lifeless plus the addition of serious network hiccups and server browser issues dosent help. If you played "Realistic Shooters" like Operation Flashpoint Dragon Rising, SWAT 4, or ANY of the 3 Rainbow Six games, you'll learn this game pales in comparison to those. It has a budget price but for that same price you can buy one of the games i just mentioned and they would be more worth the buck. All in all, the initial feeling for this game is disappointment, but only time will tell if the devs can somehow redeem these critical mistakes.","September 23, 2013","false","1.6"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

But then I wanted to get first hand on what everyone hated about it, So I hopped on bourd the shi* train to shi*ville and had a very short ride there. Right when I opened the game it I was in an avalanch of loud music and badly made intro sequencing that for the life of me could not skip, to get to the poorly made homescreen. I then went first to the training sequences to get a feel of the game. Trust me when I say this. There was no "Feel" Besides me bashing my head on the keyboard as I had to listen to the voice instructor and be frozen still for a good 20 minuets as he explained how to pis* in a can. I then got board and just got online. Seeing that only one server was active I joined and from my surprise. They were all 10 year old kids talking about eachothers mothers, I then tried playing the game. As I entered a room to get demolished by a guy facing the other direction as he shot at the wall. I then left the game. Deleted my :System32: File and said screw it to the world of videogames. Since then I have gotten married wrote a novel and even finished lawschool and now I am going to be a sucessful man in the name of the law. Overall long review short this game is the best thing thats ever happened to me and the time I played of it will be the best memories of my gaming career I once withheld.

When it comes to the tactics, this is very fun, especially with friends in CO-OP!  Some of the maps are hard, especially the ones with long ranged targets.

It held great promise and the developer spoke such sweet words, pouring honey on the ears of the people like me. Then it was released...\n\nAt first it seemed like a game with some launch hick-ups and bugs. The basis was there for T:RS to take this not-so-well sought after throne, but every update was just making more and more of a mess. Then, not very long after release, they started to sell it for 1€ and gave all owners an extra copy to give away to unsuspecting enemies friends... which is kind of a clear sign that they threw in the towel and gave up on it.\n\nAs said; the basic foundation is there; a hardcore, slow paced, co-op, tactical game... if you can get into it. It's hard enough to get a group to successfully join a server, but then you can't make that server private. The AI seems okay at first, but is actually bugged out like crap in a thunderstorm. The game freezes, the game rolls over like a dog without anyone commanding, the game just doesn't do what it's suppose to and does everything it's not suppose to. The only thing that worked from the get go; the in-game text-to-speech chat, they had removed in an update. First the maps were all too big, so you were running around searching for the last terrorist... then they made them smaller, but made them minimal.\n\nNothing has gone right with Takedown: Red Sabre, and my kind (the hardcore co-op FPS:ers) had to look elsewhere. Fortunately we found Insurgency, which is a bloody good game; get that one instead!\nThe only thing T:RS managed to do was to have our gaming group make sarcastic jokes about "...it's in the hardcore nature of the game." and "...this game is epic!" which were compliments once upon a time, but after the release and subsequent downfall of T:RS have now become the worst insults we can say about a game.\nIt's all just really sad...","September 30, 2014","false","21.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"

However, the game is playable(barely) IF you can work past those glitches.\n\nSo, what is there beyond a buggy game? Visually the game is beautiful! Impressive textures, and lighting, and while the animation leaves much to be desired, everything else is rather good.\n\nThe game labels it's self as a return to old school tactical shooters, which couldn't be farther from the truth. Yes, it's tactical in the sense that one hit will kill you, and you should be extra wary of your surroundings if you want to live, but does not even come close to the tactical FPS that it claims to be a return to.\n\nOverall, it's not an overly terrible game, and certainly has potential and is a pleasant bit of eyecandy, but just doesn't seem ready for release. By all means, if you see this on special for a really low price, pick it up! Otherwise stick to classic Rainbow Six game.\n\nUnfortunately at it's current price, and current state, I can't recommend it.\n\n4/10","September 30, 2014","false","1.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This is one of those games that metacritic will give a 32 for a good reason. The people who developed Take Down: Red Sabre probably had a good idea in mind, but executed it horribly. Take Down tries to bring realistic shooters to the modern day scene full of CoD and BF, but falls flat in a wide variety of aspects. First off, the gunplay is some of the worst I have had in a while. It consists of a poorly model weapon of choice with what seems like no recoil, but the spread on these guns is absolutely ridiculous after the first round. Second off, the AI is down right ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, including your enemies and squad mates. It seems that there is only two different poles to this AI, they will either be A) Seal Team Six grade soldiers or B) third graders that had their heads smashed in with hammers. The enemies also have something similar happening, they will either kill you instantly with one shot, no chance to kill them, or miss every single god damn round in thier mag. The AI enemies also have "unfair" tactics sometimes, most often involving them clipping through the ♥♥♥♥ing wall and blasting you and the remaining members of your squad striaght out of the game. The map design is also rather subpar in comparison to most games these days, consisting of almost exclusively CQC oriented environments, and mass enemy spawning. The worst part about all of this is that this is a game coming out in 2013 and very well could've been the spiritual successor to Tom Clancy's: Rainbow Six series, but takes that oppportunity and runs it into a 747 jet. A game with much potential, but with no delivery.\n3/10","October 17, 2013","false","0.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","3"

My version of that is EVE Online. There are also games which you, the player, fail to see why people hate the game so much. For me, Orion: Dino Horde is a great example. Takedown: Red Sabre is neither of those examples. and wasn't worth the 99 cents I paid this past Summer Sale.\n\nFrom what I assume, this game is trying to be a cross between Counter-Strike and Rainbow Six, but fails at both. The weapons don't feel anywhere near as powerful and fun to use as Counter-Strike and the teammate AI is so bad that it feels more like a series of cheap deaths rather than a tactical experience.  I've had two of my squadmates in single player killed by a guy who seemingly appeared out of nowhere behind me and there was no indication that there was someone behind me. No voice clips, no gunfire from my AI teammates who were just standing around scratching their asses rather than checking in the directions that I couldn't face, nothing. The enemy AI is utterly cheap and the teammate AI rarely does anything to help you and more likely than not follows you around like a lost child looking for its parents.\n\nThe online community is dead and for good reason. The control is extremely sluggish and I don't feel like can be stealthy and tactical when I can only walk from room to room rather than running from cover to cover. As stated before, the guns feel weak and the whole pace of the game is extremely off. I initally wanted to play the game long enough to get the trading cards and sell them to make a little return on investment but the game is so bad that I can't even play the game for that long. Avoid at all costs, not worth 99 cents in a sale and the current asking price of 4.99 is almost criminal.","July 6, 2014","false","0.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I figured if more people strarted playing maybe the developers would try to fix it. I wanted to give this game a chance. Unfortunately it seems like the devs abandoned it. I do not reccomend buying it because you would be buying a broken game that will never be fixed.\n\n\nMY ORIGINAL REVIEW:\nAfter seeing all the negative reviews I decided to weigh in my own opinion.\nSure, the game is still a bit rough around the edges, but it's fun to play on co-op.\nIt has great potential and the developers are still working on updates and new content.\nIf you are a tactical shooter fan you should support the developers instead of hating\non the game and just saying "SWAT 4/Rainbow Six 3 are better". Of course these are great\ngames, but they have been around for 9 and 11 years respectively. Are you going to just\nkeep playing them for the next decade and discard everything else, because it's not as good?\nOr would you rather try and support the people that want to bring back the experience?\n\nIf 14€/$15 is too steep just add the game to your wishlist and wait for a sale.\nThere's no rush and it's easy to snag it for a fraction of the price. You even\nget an extra copy so you can gift it to a friend and play together. Better yet,\nI'm sure all the people who hate the game so much they say "it gave them cancer"\nwill be more than happy to trade their extra copy or give it to you for free.\nTry reaching out to them.\n\nIf all disappointed "true tactical shooter fans" tried to give constructive criticism,\nparticipate in the community and support the developer, we might eventually get the real\nRainbow Six and SWAT successor. The potential is there, it just needs more polish.\n\nTL;DR: This game is underrated. It has the potential, but we need to support the\ndevelopers instead of hating to make it work.\nAlso, wait for a sale and buy it dirt cheap.\nOr trade for it since so many people have extra copies.\n\nPROS:\n- the weapons feel good and behave realistically\n- the maps are great\n- there is a lot of gear/equipment to choose\n- the graphics are good but still run decently on older computers\n\nCONS:\n- the AI: enemies are unpredictable and teammates are unreliable\n- there is no action planning\n- you can only give very basic orders to your teammates\n\nPRO TIP: There is a very useful map guide from 505 Games on the Takedown community hub.","March 16, 2014","false","11.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

While the AI seem to be unable to notice bullets from a far distance, they react quickly enough if they see you and don't always instagib you, for example, if you are peeking around walls. The wall-peek system, while a good concept, is executed in such a way that you end up having to slowly peek around all of the walls, in order to shoot the guy waiting around the corner before he can see you. This game might be good multiplayer, but the single-player experience feels like trying to use a cheese grater to kill a SWAT team. It's possible, but it mostly relies on luck and the enemies messing up.","December 20, 2014","false","2.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This is one of those games that metacritic will give a 32 for a good reason. The people who developed Take Down: Red Sabre probably had a good idea in mind, but executed it horribly. Take Down tries to bring realistic shooters to the modern day scene full of CoD and BF, but falls flat in a wide variety of aspects. First off, the gunplay is some of the worst I have had in a while. It consists of a poorly model weapon of choice with what seems like no recoil, but the spread on these guns is absolutely ridiculous after the first round. Second off, the AI is down right ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, including your enemies and squad mates. It seems that there is only two different poles to this AI, they will either be A) Seal Team Six grade soldiers or B) third graders that had their heads smashed in with hammers. The enemies also have something similar happening, they will either kill you instantly with one shot, no chance to kill them, or miss every single god damn round in thier mag. The AI enemies also have "unfair" tactics sometimes, most often involving them clipping through the ♥♥♥♥ing wall and blasting you and the remaining members of your squad striaght out of the game. The map design is also rather subpar in comparison to most games these days, consisting of almost exclusively CQC oriented environments, and mass enemy spawning. The worst part about all of this is that this is a game coming out in 2013 and very well could've been the spiritual successor to Tom Clancy's: Rainbow Six series, but takes that oppportunity and runs it into a 747 jet. A game with much potential, but with no delivery.\n3/10","October 17, 2013","false","0.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","3"

It might give you a second to two to react, is about all the concession you'll get there.\n1B: There are a limited number of map navigation choices from your spawn point, without getting shot, due to the above.\n2: The movement mechanics are reminiscent of CounterStrike. Only, not in a good way. It's like putting CounterStrike in Tar, and trying to move. Combined with the above, will leave you dead quite often.\n3: Grenades are more of a distraction and danger to the player, than the AI, due to the above.\n\nThere were several other things that should have either been fixed, or not implemented at all, which slip my mind.\nNot something i intend to go back and play again.

My version of that is EVE Online. There are also games which you, the player, fail to see why people hate the game so much. For me, Orion: Dino Horde is a great example. Takedown: Red Sabre is neither of those examples. and wasn't worth the 99 cents I paid this past Summer Sale.\n\nFrom what I assume, this game is trying to be a cross between Counter-Strike and Rainbow Six, but fails at both. The weapons don't feel anywhere near as powerful and fun to use as Counter-Strike and the teammate AI is so bad that it feels more like a series of cheap deaths rather than a tactical experience.  I've had two of my squadmates in single player killed by a guy who seemingly appeared out of nowhere behind me and there was no indication that there was someone behind me. No voice clips, no gunfire from my AI teammates who were just standing around scratching their asses rather than checking in the directions that I couldn't face, nothing. The enemy AI is utterly cheap and the teammate AI rarely does anything to help you and more likely than not follows you around like a lost child looking for its parents.\n\nThe online community is dead and for good reason. The control is extremely sluggish and I don't feel like can be stealthy and tactical when I can only walk from room to room rather than running from cover to cover. As stated before, the guns feel weak and the whole pace of the game is extremely off. I initally wanted to play the game long enough to get the trading cards and sell them to make a little return on investment but the game is so bad that I can't even play the game for that long. Avoid at all costs, not worth 99 cents in a sale and the current asking price of 4.99 is almost criminal.","July 6, 2014","false","0.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

That's well worth 1 dollar in my opinion. But 5 dollars? Not so much.\n\nNow, if you are looking at it for the full price, which is 5 dollars, you should take your money elsewhere. This game was kickstarted and I was looking forward to an actual tactical shooter as everyone else was. The team behind this game were a good set of developers who everyone believed could make a really good tactical shooter that could compare to games like SWAT 4 or the old Rainbow Six games.\n\nWhat you get instead is a game that seems about 80% finished, with solid shooting mechanics but shoddy texture work and poor AI. The AI sometimes hear you through two walls but sometimes don't notice you when you are next to them. Doesn't make any sense. The online community for this game doesn't exist as everyone has jumped ship on this game. So you're stuck with the AI teammates who just get killed constantly.\n\nFor a dollar, if you are interested in a tactical shooter that you'll probably play for a couple of hours, go for it. But if you are looking for a tactical shooter for 5 dollars, look elsewhere. You're just wasting your money here.","June 28, 2014","false","2.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game is so hard that the player is pushed into a position where they have to use their tactical prowess to survive. Guns basically insta-kill and there are pretty much no revives.\n\nThe game, in its complete form, is an utter disaster. The maps are way too linear for tactical gameplay. I kept walking down stairs or into a room with a guy, and it would be who shot first rather than what strategy I used. The map design just doesn't help this mess, and that's only the beginning.\n\nRainbow Six and other tactical shooters are fun because they don't sacrifice gameplay for realism. In Red Sabre, you can't get revived, and you don't respawn. If you die, you lose, and you are taken back to the lobby. In Hotline miami, you die a lot, but you respawn quickly and get as many chances as you want to complete the level. The same thing goes for Super Meat Boy. The truth is, Red Sabre needs a reason to be worth playing. The graphics are bland, the maps are linear and unexciting to say the least, and I don't feel compelled to completely restart the mission each time I fail at it.\n\nThe developers clearly wanted a realistic feel, so that the players would be forced to play tactically. They did almost everything wrong with this game, and it isn't even close to being redeemed. The truth is, there are way better games on the market that do what this game does, but better. Honestly, I feel like this game tries to be unique among other shooters, but goes way over the top, and sacrifices any little bit of fun this game could've been capable of.","June 24, 2014","false","1.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There is no "Friendly Fire off" nor any auto team kick for team killers. Nor is there a votekick option.\n\nThis combination means that instantly everyone tries to kill each other on a team, unless they know each other.\n\nFor a game about team work, this oversight instantly breaks any ability of the game to function within its own parameters.\n\nFor gunplay, it's clunky, has odd choices in controls (Auto-stick leaning is not a common choice for people), and the bots will generally kill you instantly.\n\nThe lack of quick movement, a cover system, or any cool gadgets such as SWAT 4 provided, means you just walk around a corner and flip a coin to see if you get shot instantly or not.\n\nSo by yourself or with others, this game is not complete nor fun.\nI would rate it a decent student submission, and little more.","December 5, 2014","false","0.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The controls are ok, but the gameplay is not that funny depends on if you play singleplayer or multiplayer. In singleplayer it is not fun at all it´s difficult to play and come to proceed the mission. Because the enemies pretty much is op and sometimes you think you hit them with a bullet and they are not dead. Mission are really confusing, because it´s not showing (except explaining what to do) like on a map where things is. Yourself might killed by one bullet. But multiplayer might be litte bit easier to accomplish missions than singleplayer because you are more than one and it is easier to take down your enemies.

When I finally installed the game I could not belive my eyes. The game was truly terrible. Im wondering if all the money they raised for the kickstarter was used on rendering highly processed screenshots to show us. The game looks and plays nothing like what they showed on the kickstarter and is full of bugs and glitches. Dont waste your money or if this game winds up being free, dont waste your time.

I redid the first mission about 5 times before realizing that I had already completed it, but it  just doesn't tell you. Then I went on to the first mission thinking that it was a little mistake, before realizing that the AI are so overpowered they can hear you sneaking through the walls. Even your peaking ability doesn't help, as it only allows a small vision of the area, not so far that you could actually see them like it was desined to. I didn't even care to play the other missions fully as this one really just demoralized, depressed, and unsatissfied me in everyway possible for a game like this.

It looks like there was a good vision behind it, but the execution of the vision was horrid on nearly every front.\n\nThe engine has bugs galore (dropping to 1fps when I pressed F to reload?

The AI is stellar and has realistic combat capabilities one example is when 2 of my squad members died in an epic firefight where a single shot hit a finger of those soldiers and they dropped  dead, but not before their arms got caught inside a wall. The enemies have an amazing AI where they will fire in the air and run in circles untill you hit them.

If you're going to make a Rainbow-Six clone, at least get the AI right.\n\nThe enemy seems to know who and where you are at all times, despite being silenced.\nThere's not a single millisecond of delay, they see something moving they're already firing.\nMakes me wonder how they could take over that building in the first place without shooting each others.\n\nIf you're creeping up a corner, they already know you're there and are waiting guns drawn.\nThis is not fun nor would I qualify this as "hard", it takes all the tactics away.\n\nI'm used to FPS and my reaction time is usually under 250ms, add the rotational speed and aiming I'd guess it's around 750ms and yet i'm too slow. By the time I click, i'm already dying.\nAnd note that the NPC shouldn't be aware of my presence while I knew very well where he was (thanks to metagaming)\n\nEven the worst of the Rainbow-Six games is better than this.\nThe controls are horrible, even while wearing the lightest armor, you feel like a pile of bricks.\nThe only good points I noticed are the choice between entrypoints, the time limit, the subsonic rounds,FMJ/JHP. Whoever made these, obviously knew about the basics of weaponry.\n\nI'm sure a lot of work and passion went into this game, problem is, the finished product is not great, not great at all.\nIt claims to be a successor to Rainbow-Six games but doesn't even include the mechanics we loved so much. I can understand they can't produce as many items/weapons as Rainbow-Six did but they could at least build the mechanics just like it. For example, In Takedown, a silenced 1911 pistol and a regular 1911 pistol are two different weapons and cannot be both used in the same mission, while in Rainbow-Six, you could just take the silencer off at any time, or put it back on.\n\nAnother example would be the weapon slots, you only have a primary weapon and a pistol. The "secondary weapons" should be named "Pistols" since its all it includes. In Rainbow-Six, you had a pistol, along with a primary weapon and a secondary weapon, depending on which Rainbow-Six we're talking about, you could use two LMGs or two snipers if you wanted to, the freedom was there. Now i'm not against having only two weapons, as it makes sense, we're not the army after all. I'm just against the lack of freedom when it comes to choosing your secondary weapon, they could easily let other small guns as a secondary weapon, such has MPs and smaller shotguns or just allow any weapons to be chosen in those slots, so you could have two pistols or a shotty and a sniper. You know, whatever strikes your fancy.\n\nMaybe it's just me, maybe it's the 15 mins spent in-game. I'll eventually play more, although I doubt I'll change my mind, this is not a game i'd recommend.","March 1, 2014","false","0.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

The first round went well enough - only that I started to hear a russian kid talking to his family. (Probably should have done his dishes, but failed to do so - I really couldn't understand)\n\nThe next round, said russian kid starts to shoot us (Teammates) in the head - procedes to talk gibberish. Probably insulted our upbringing, or our parents. Maybe he asked us, if we could do his dishes. I really couldn't understand.\n\nI tried to kick him, or remove him from the game - put to no avail. We restarted the server.\n\nNow more than just that russian kid joined, but some rather heavily mentally ill as well.
