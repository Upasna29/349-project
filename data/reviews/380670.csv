This game is so much better than what I was expecting. The detail, my gosh, the detail. I was blown away by the opening screen, even. The menus are gorgeous and perfect for VR, the planes look amazing, and there is a surprising amount of variety in the gameplay.\n\nThis game is SO MUCH MORE than simply drawing flight routes for planes to land (a-la Air Control for mobile platform). That's what I was expecting, and it's there, but oh my, it's only a tiny part. This is a perfect example of a game that doesn't convey it's beauty from demo vids or pictures. Maybe consider releasing a short demo of the first mission? I bought this because it looked interesting, the dev seemed really nice from interviews before Vive release, and I really appreciated their communication about the initial sticker shock and subsequent price drop.\n\nHad I known the game was this polished, with so much variety, I would not have cared about the aforementioned reasons for the purchase. This game is a blast, plain and simple. Can't wait to get out of work so I can get back to it!\n\nLove planes? You'll probably really enjoy Final Approach.

First i thought it is one of those mobile games where you have to guide planes without crashing them and was pretty sure that i will get a refund after trying it. I was wrong.\n\nThis game has a lot to do and the missions are very varied. The graphics are very good and just fit the game and VR. It seems also like a very complete game and not like one of the many overpriced tech-demos. VR is very well integrated into the game it's not only fun to look at your airport but also to do the short mini missions in 1st person. When doing the mini missions the game doesn't stop and you can see all the things happening arround you. If you are in doubt, try it and get a refund if you don't like it.\n\nI think this game deserves more attention.","April 10","true","12.4"," 13 of 13 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","13","13","0","2"

The quality and polish is really really high.  The gameplay isn't bad, but I just found it to be a little... slow and simple.  I think kids will LOVE this because it's basically playing with a big toy set.\n\nI think the current price ($30 @ 25% off) is warranted given the amount of effort and quality put into the game, but I don't know if it's something I personally would get $30 worth of fun out of, particularly given the competitive launch lineup.\n\nIf the prospect of standing like a giant over an airport and playing with it like toys sounds like something you would really really be into, then go ahead and pull the trigger.

It is like being in a toddler's dream. You draw flight paths for planes, send them to their hangars, rescue car crash victims with helicopters, and even shrink down to normal size to put out fires, scare away birds, and do some electric maintanence.\n\nIt really is magical to see tiny little planes flying around your head and bend down to look at people on the runway.

It looks so lame and boring on a monitor, but in VR it's amazing! Now I don't regret buying this at all!\n\nOh, and I have to mention something that doesn't matter at all: Between each level you're in this office and WOW! The presence there is amazing.

Aside from guiding planes, you transport items, put out engine fires, rescue downed pilots, fire rockets and machine guns at enemy aircraft, and even capture aliens. In the later missions it gets very busy. It's always fantastic to suddenly zoom from the "god view" (where everything feels like playing with toys) to the full-scale ground view (where you are suddenly standing e.g. on the deck of a giant aircraft carrier while fighter jets zip around above you).

You're always leaning over and after a while, your back isn't exactly enjoying itself.\n\nA possible fix to that would be to have the airport raised like on a table. If you've tried Valves Bow and Arrow demo and the Castle miniature you get a good understanding of what i mean. For example a living room with a big table and on that table sits the "playset" (would fit in with the feeling of "playing with Micro Machines")\nThat way, your back won't hurt after a while and you enjoy the game more. If the Devs would include that as an option I'd be very thankfull.\n\nGripe #2:\nThe frequency of "sh*t goes wrong" - now I get you want the game to be a challenge but I just felt like I'm doing nothing BUT shooing away seagulls and extinguising fires. That may be down to the fact that i'm not a great player at this or something but I would appreciated a more "relaxed" mode. In my opinion it was just "too much" and I ended up not enjoying the game anymore and just exiting - which is a shame because, as I said, I really enjoy the Idea behind the game.\n\nSo if those two gripes were to be adressed in later patches, I'd definitely change my recommendation for that game.\n\nAs it stands, the way it is now and from my point of view I would not recommend it, although your view may differ and perhaps you don't mind the two gripes I've mentioned.\n\n-Gextroll signing off. o7","May 10","false","0.6"," 11 of 19 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","11","19","0","0"

The transition between third-person and first-person is downright remarkable, presenting a perspective that makes the world come to life.\n\nFinal Approach suffers from some repetition as with the entire HTC Vive launch line-up, but does present several missions that are moderate in length. Because of this, it is one of the games that I foresee offering some of the longest-duration play value.\n\nI would recommend Final Approach as one of the top three options for HTC Vive launch as it's unique and should provide around four+ hours of entertainment.\n\nYou can read more about my impressions here: http://www.gamerevolution.com/features/final-approach-on-htc-vive-shows-how-multiperspective-vr-games-can-blow-your-mind","May 3","true","1.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I enjoyed playing this on my phone in 2D years ago so it was an automatic buy for me when I saw that it was available in VR. This game does not disappoint. The thing I love about it is that it is 100% scalable. I can place the Airport in my entire 16x18 living room or I can place it in my lap while I sit at my desk. Room scale is awesome... running from one side of the airfield to the next in an attempt to land a burning airplane, rescue downed pilots, shoot aliens, put out fires, and dropping bombs all in a timely manner.\nIf you liked this game in 2D then itâ€™s a must buy in VR.

For starters, you're underestimating how much depth adds to the experience, now you need to consider where the plane is in 3D space as well as what approach angle you've drawn, as planes can't turn on a dime.\n\nThere's also a lot more depth than Flight Control. You're doing far more than simply landing planes, you also need to take them off too, which requires you to pay attention and make sure there's a clear run. Different planes also have different requirements, passenger planes need to be taken to the terminal before they can take off again and military planes need to go to the military hanger before take-off. There's also things like emergencies that require you to personally extinguish a burning plane or simply help out with luggage sorting.\n\nIn later stages, you do more than just land planes. You might be piloting a helicopter to catch a criminal and drop them off at the police station or fighting UFOs with fighter jets and turrets (which you can also personally control in first person view.\n\nAnd finally, the game has a loving level of attention to detail in the visuals. They're not just well-made but despite the zoomed-out view of the game, there's still lots of little details to see if you come in close. The whole game feels like you're looking at a little model railroad! It's a big departure from similar games that cut corners because they figure you probably won't see it.\n\nSo yeah, Final Approach is a great game, it's had a lot of attention and polish applied that fits it's "premium" price.

The first island is about what you would expect, you guide planes to runways and try to avoid them crashing into each other. Sometimes a plane is on fire and you need to zoom down to play a quick mini-game to put it out, sometimes birds are on the runway and you need to scare them away with an airhorn.\n\nThe second level however starts to mix it up where you are in charge of a city airport with lots more runways, no birds to manage but a lot more stuff to juggle. You need to start planning which direction you want certain planes to land on the runway because if they need repairs they'll need to taxi over to one side of the airport while it's a military aircraft it needs to park in certain hangers. The third level isn't even at an airport.\n\nIt is enjoyable to pick an aircraft out of the air and draw a line to guide its approach.

This is especially because this game gets a whole lot better as you move along.  The progress of the game allows you to learn and pick up skills.  Then it gets a lot more intense.\n\nYou start by directing slow aircraft on an island.  Then you move up to a commercial airport.  Then you direct helicopters in the middle of a metropolis.\n\nThe last stage I played convinced me to write this review.  You get to direct fighter aircraft to land on an aircraft carrier!  In every stage you are able to get to the ground level to put out fires.  This includes fires on aircraft.  So, I actually got to stand on an aircraft carrier as a full-sized naval fighter jet taxied past me.  I felt like I could actually touch the sidewinder missiles!  I looked to the left to see ground crew prepping or repairing other fighters.\n\nThere are some other incredibly fun things you can do in this stage but I think I have already provided enough spoilers!\n\nGet this game.
