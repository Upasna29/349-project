I will write something more comprehensive when it's at release. This game has an absolutely fantastic shell for a great game. The gameplay feels wonderful, the textures and visuals are top notch, the simplistic yet addictive item/loot/stats systems all work. The random generation of worlds is passable (although still could about ten times as many prefab chunks.\n\nHOWEVER.\n\nIt's extremely light on content. I don't know if that's because they are leaving that to last, however i blew though this game in 18 minutes. And I did not rush. I did die about 20 times before I finished it, so my total playtime is a few hours. That is still absolutely horrible compared to ANY other game of this type out there. Even very cheaply made games like rouge shooter have 100 times more content than this game. It needs more levels. Bigger levels. More items, more scaling. Etc.\n\nIt's like a demo version of a game. And I am kind of scared that they are just going to tweak systems until release, instead of releasing actual game length.\n\nThe game needs to be streatched across a wider canvas, make the drops scale very slowly upwards, make the levels huge with multi areas leading to the floor down, so we can explore sprawling levels if we wish, instead of these tinny little dungeons. Right now, because this game has the core mechanics of a 10/10 indie game. I am going to recommend this game. However if the content is the same as it is now, at release. Then I'll be changing my recommendation.","May 27, 2014","true","8.6"," 156 of 173 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","156","173","0","5"

Been playing it since it was in it's Alpha stages and was free and since then this game has improved A TON. Every run is randomly generated and you never know what you're going to find or have to go up against. Every level you go gets harder and harder and if you don't have very good gear or arnt leveled up alot, then you're not going to last very long (Especially on the trip back.) The replayability of this game is great too. It hasnt gotten old and I have yet to beat it. (The trip back is extremely hard if you don't have alot of HP pots, Good wands and really good armor.) I give it a 9/10. Definitely worth my $8.\n\nPS: This game is still in beta, but the Devs seem to have some great ideas coming up like shops, more levels, classes and other things. So if you're worried about content, stop worrying. There's alot more to come and this game has a ton of potential.\n\nEDIT: (11/30/2014) The game is still being updated and is still improving drastically. With the addition of 2 hand slots and destructable boxes along with a ton of new room layouts (Namely the caves, they've been completely re-done to look 100 times better.) Everything i've said before still stands and i'd still reccomend getting this.

The game starts you with a random inventory (one weapon, one food, one magic item, and some gold) and you can talk to a few NPCs to hear about the dangerous dungeon ahead. You head inside and explore the dungeon killing enemies and collecting progressively better loot until eventually, you die. When you respawn, thinking that all hope is lost, you realize that your gold from your previous life is still with you. You also realize, going into the dungeon, that it's different each time. The Camp where the npcs live in the beginning has many shops and the dungeon is endless and randomly generated. You can collect and save your gold to buy better loot in the town or just find as much as you can before you're killed in the dungeon.

I got this in the Roguelike 2 Humble Bundle (so it was something like £4 for this and other rougelikes), but this was the game I was looking forward to. I'll quickly list some pros, cons, and then my experience.\n\nPro:\n• Really good combat system with a focus on timing (nice balance of annoying bats and poison worms, and non-annoying enemies).\n• Levelling up and getting loot works well. You sometimes get a rare piece of kit, which makes you feel like god for a few floors.\n• Very attractive game (although there  could be a little room for improvement in some of the room details), chunky pixels are officially cool. The first, second and final themes work really well. The third theme is a little pedestrian - and so dark you just can't see anything in it.\n• Music is great, very fitting but not in-your-face-y.\n\nCon:\n• Foremost: almost all of the game is just so dark. There needs to be a 'Scroll of Light', or an update making the Candle light up the world a little more. In the third 'theme' (I won't spoil it), it's so dark that you often can't see any monsters, especially as only a few pixels aren't hiding in the water.\n• Jesus christ, the poison goes on for years.\n• Very little point in not choosing to level up HP when you get the choice. I went from 8HP to 38HP (ish) in one run-through, and if you wear the armour you just find, you basically don't need to worry. If you don't, then the poison (above) will easily kill you.\n• No way to block with your shield? And also, 2handed weapons don't seem to do any more damage, to make up for not having a shield? And - equipping books as a shield feels like it should do something, but no notes anywhere make it clear what (if anything) having a book equipped does.\n• Regardless of the above things: I finished the game in my first run-through. If you can't be bothered (e.g. at the end of the fourth 'theme'), you can simply run past enemies and take negligible damage - less so than you would if you tried to fight it, especially seeing regen items are so rare.\n• And least importantly: this game is evidently unfinished. I understand it's a roguelike, but it does need a bit more content. If you could fetch the orb, run back to base, then go on another mission (assuming the orb unlocks a 'new' dungeon), that would be cool. Or challenges, modifiers, things to unlock, weapons to start with, etc., that would be awesome. I just feel like I couldn't play through it again. Maybe levelling up should unlock cool spells, or something similar? I don't feel like I need to grind or farm in the dungeon to look for some awesome and rare loot that makes me godlike. It needs something rare like that, or something that unlocks. In my opinion, that's how Risk of Rain is just infinitely replayable.\n\nTL/DR: I still would totally play it again, but it's relatively easy to finish in the first play-through. This game is already good, and I'm assuming it'll be great by the time it's out of Beta! :-)","March 20, 2015","true","1.4"," 27 of 28 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","27","28","0","0"

It's strikingly similar to Minecraft, yet different. While Minecraft focuses on exploration and diversity (biomes, items, creatures, etc.), the developers of this game only chose to focus on dungeon exploration with little creativity in respect to monsters, items, and biome.\n\nI understand content takes time to add, but this game is already in beta, lacks a solid update history, and most importantly - diversity in monster, characters, and items. Let's get real, this game has been out since 2013 and it is now 2016 - So where's the content?\n\nWhile this game may provide fun for a short while, I would stay away from this one until the developers can get their act together.\n\nConsumers work hard for their money and deserve a polished game - this one is just not there yet.","February 22","false","0.9"," 61 of 85 people (72%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","72","61","85","2","20"

You're gonna need it..." Through careful traversal of the world and observation of your enemies and the effects of your gear you became your own tutor. your victories and your failures were down to your strats, observations and reactions. This is what made games like Doom, Half Life and other 90's titles such classics and Delver brings back that style of gaming with grace and it's such a joy to see this approach to gaming still existant and appealing in this era of the industry!\n\nDelver is a dungeon crawler, first person roguelike where permadeath results in the loss of your character upon death along with your items and level. That SOUNDS punishing but with out it, the appeal of this game is simply lost and it takes the experience of being in this amazing game to really appreciate that. You do however keep any gold you find which allows you purchase items you feel may help either balance the weaknesses in your gameplay style or further boost your strengths.\n\nThe game is split in to dungeon levels which go:\n\nDungeon 1\nDungeon 2\nCaves 1\nCaves 2\nSewers 1\nSewers 2\nRuins\n\nThe objective is to make your way in to the cursed ruins and obtain an orb to then double back and actually climb your way through those levels back to the surface, all while being pursued by the undead that roam the ruins looking for their orb!\n\nEnemy types, difficulties and tactics vary through each level, constantly keeping you on your toes to see whether or not the enemy is fast, slow, hits hard or poisons or maybe they use projectile attacks. Eventually you'll come to recognise things like audio cues of monsters, the sounds of traps being detonated or particle effect remains on the floor, giving you clues as to what's gone on in the area.\n\nThe game's golden feature which makes this such an appealing experience is that everything is useful and thinking outside the box is critical to success. And the beauty of it is it's all down to you which makes the gameplay so rewarding with even the simplest of feats. for example. I noticed my run speed was still too slow for me to run over a trap and not get enough distance to get away from the blast radius it triggers but I remembered seeing enemies also trigger traps so I thought "what about items?" I took a broken wand with no charges left in it and threw it on the trap. Sure enough it detonated and I could move through it during the down time while the trap was resetting. Not only did that feel rewarding that my plan worked but I now knew that 'useless' items like empty wands still served a purpose, so I kept on to one or two as I explored.\n\nAnother example was when I was using a bow. I noticed sometimes when I missed, the arrow would bounce off a wall and I could pick it back up. When I came across the mage skeletons who are very projectile heavy and can easily be a problem, I wondered if I could bounce my arrows off the wall around a corner to fight them whilst being safe from their projectiles. I aimed at an angle and fired, sure enough the mage caught the arrow in his eye socket and he popped! Another rewarding feeling and a little more understanding of the game's mechanics!\n\nDelver is a very small budget game and when you get the hang of it, it can easily be done in under an hour which results in the game resetting after a victory screen as if you died which is a shame because it feels like all the content can be experienced in a short manner of time and I want to spend so many hours in the world of Delver! The game is still early access as I write this so here's hoping the amazing guy behind this high potential title keeps dishing out further quality content!\n\n(P.S. The projectile particle effects remind me so much of Heretic's visuals and that's just another 1000 bonus points to this title :P)","August 10, 2014","true","5.3"," 29 of 32 people (91%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","91","29","32","2","1"

I'll start off by saying that this is a game in which when you die you loose just about everything, i won't tell you what you keep because it defeats the purpose of playing it doesn't it. But this game combines a perfect sense of rogue-like/fps with modular enhancements on the website. The game although being in Early-Acess, which i can already hear the ugggh another one. Yes it is in early access but it being in early access means lots of updates and things to look forward to in the game to make you want to play it even more after each update.\n\nPros\n- It combines rogue-like/rpg style game with a nice combat experience\n- Really simple and easy to pick up even just to play around 1 life\n- Animations are pretty decent for what it is\n- In my opinion its not to hard or too easy it hits that sweet spot that most games don't\n- Varying loot is always a thing i love to see and this game has it and like skyrim you want to pick up everything\n- Modular (-meaning skins, hopefully in the future other mods)\n- It has a random loadout everytime delving into the dungeon that keeps the game refreshing\n\nThings to Improve Upon\n- Just some mechanics nothing to important like the save game feature\n- I would like to see a bigger camp in the future maybe, just with a bit more options maybe a reward/trophy house of boss another idea\n- Steam achievements would be nice so I work towards or find something to it that adds a rewarding experience\n\nCons\n- For an early access not sure it can be counted as a con but it falls short beatable in like 3 hours since i last played it :(\n- It's not really rewarding for the outside camp experience to me\n\nYes it's a good game but there arent many cons i found in my experience of playing it all the way through. I will always look forward to hack and slashing my way to the end again as the game updates. This will definately go on the list of games i follow to see what comes of it. its an easy 7.5/10 :3.

It's a good addition to your library.  It's simple enough to start playing when you have limited time or attention, but robust enough that you don't feel like you're playing an indie throwaway.  Its randomized levels provide replay value and the ability to stockpile gold between runs allows for you to splurge on a run to give yourself a head start.  Also, the developer is very active.  It's obvious Delver is a labor of love.\n\nSome tips, for new players:\n1. Your HP refills when you level up, so stockpile your food in early levels.\n2. If you inventory is getting full, leave a treasure trove of food and wands at the ladder down to the next floor.\n3. Heavier armor slows you down, but not as much as you might think.\n4. When leveling, I prioritize Health > Attack > Speed.  I've never put points into the stats that buff wands or archery.\n5.

And just when you say "This game is fun,  but a bit easy", it will brutally murder you and take all your stuff, leaving you only with coins and questions.\n\nBeing entirely randomly generated, from the size of each floor to the quality of each weapon, there is exellent replay value.

It's quite simple to pick up and understand, you can play it for 5 minutes or 5 hours and it's always fun.  If you end up dying (which will likely happen a lot for the first few tries) you restart at the camp and go through a new dungeon with randomized equipment to start but gold carries over from each life.  There are 2 shop characters in the camp outside, 1 for general equipment (armor, weapons, potions, etc) and the other for scrolls that might come in handy.  Generally use the wands when you have them and you'll last longer.  Anything ranged works best.\n\nOverall I'd give the game 9/10.  I only drop it by 1 cause it's a little repetitive over time but still quite fun even with the simple graphics which I find perfect for the game and it's style of play.  It's also not a super expensive game and as of the time I played it I didn't notice any bugs through about 6 levels of the dungeon.

Sure, I almost rage quit a couple times, but that's just video games. I like that you dont customize your character because if you did you would be way more upset with dying (which you do QUITE A BIT). No two dungeons are the same, and you face new challenges and get new rewards with every delve into the myserious ruins. Some rooms are the same each play (just the rooms with transition ladders, however), yet the game never runs out of surprises or fun.

It still needs work and I honestly think you should hold out for a release because it's been four months since the last word on development and honestly this game is barely worth $8 in it's current state. It's a pretty engaging game if dungeon crawls are your thing. It's got all the stuff that makes a dungeon crawler wonderful.\n\nI enjoyed it a lot but I have a couple gripes:\n\nFirst, this game is like all the other roguelike-likes. It has randomly generated levels and some light RPG mechanics and that's it for likenesses. I would love to have a roguelike-like that doesn't distance itself so heavily from roguelike mechanics, but what can you do.\n\nSecond, the difficulty spikes through the ceiling at the end. The game's really easy for something that bills itself as a roguelike game, up until the very end. It's really frustrating to work your way through the game for an hour or two only to hit an unbeatable ending that throws the cheapest difficulty it can at you: flooding the rooms with spawns of endgame enemies at a rate of ~1/sec(that's an honest estimation, not an exaggeration). I'm all for reasonable progression of difficulty, and this ain't it.\n\nOverall, I kinda-sorta recommend this game. It definitely needs work, but I think you'll find some enjoyment out of it in its current state. Whether that enjoyment is worth $8 is debatable. I would personally suggest you wait for more work to be done on it before buying.","January 13","true","2.2"," 21 of 26 people (81%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","81","21","26","3","0"

I heard a good review and it was on sale so I checked it out. I beat the game in 74 minutes. After learning some basic strategies, enemies became super predictable and completely unthreatening. At no point was there any fear or tension. I killed the boss without even realizing his significance. With no enemy scaling, leveling health and decking myself out in good armor made me essentially unkillable. Even barring that, the endgame whoopsie do of having to run back through the entire level refilled with monsters was a cakewalk. You could run circles around them and not get hit. On top of that, the twist ending bored me. There was no presentation to it, no aplomb, no reason to care about it.\n\nI have no reason to come back to this game. I have seemingly seen all there is to see in it. I enjoyed my time delving, but have been given no reason to ever come back to it. There is no point to this game being a roguelike, which was the entire reason I wanted to play it in the first place. Even if there is some second and third layer of fun I could come back to, it's not evident. Character progression is not saved. There is no reward for beating the game.\n\nI had fun.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/unpieced/recommended/249630/","unpieced","Qt Alix","http://steamcommunity.com/id/unpieced/","356 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThis is one of those games that don't look as fun as the playthroughs of it. I was in love with the graphics, but the charm soon wears off, within only three hours for me personally. Regaurdless, don't be completely deterred from this game by my review. You can still get some enjoyment out of it (though I would never recommend it at full price). Don't have high expectations though. After watching several playthroughs of the game and seen what I thought was a ton of fun, I was disappointed with the actual product.\n\nI've seen this being described as a "a rougebased 3d RPG game with permadeath" To put it more basic, it's a dungeon crawler at it's simplist. There's nothing complex about it. Explore the dungeon fighting enemies, leveling up, and picking up loot like weapons, food, potions, and armor. So anyone can jump into it right away. However it's not exactly easy either. In the beginning I struggled with not succumbing to foes as it's an art to get close enough to hit an enemy with your beginning weapon (a very short dagger) without getting attacked yourself every time. You have to be at just the right distance to hit them without getting hit back, and since you only start with a mere 8 HP, it can be tough for new players, but it's just something to get used to. The goal of the game is to descend down 7 floors, defeat a boss, collect an orb from him, and to work your way back up the 7 floors to leave without dying.\n\nSome people have said the game is very easy, and that they were able to beat it in a mere hour or less. I've had a hard time with it, and I'll explain why. It's typical logic that you need to be a high level the farther you advance. Althoguh other players may disagree about this with me, I've found that I've needed to grind, or else I'm just not leveled up enough the deeper into the dungeon I get. The big problem with this is that it's almost impossible to grind in Delver. After you clear the floor the first time, enemies will continue to spawn a little (for a short time), but they'll spawn less and less until they stop all together. When I backtrack, I only run into a few to zero enemies, which means I have to go back and forth on a floor over and over again to try to level up. It's a very slow process.\n\nI also have to cover the two glitches I noticed. The first thing I noticed was how very laggy such a graphically simple game was, and then I noticed more specifically, it was lagging in time with the music. I had to turn the music off because it really slowed down the game. Maybe it's just my laptop and won't happen to all computers, but I figured I would give the heads up to people. The sound effects worked just fine however, and I want to mention the nice touch it added to the gameplay. The enemies would say phrases like "I heard something" and "What was that?" that would make you aware of their presence. Now you could still be spooked by an enemy, because some enemies wouldn't make much noise, but it did cut back on the startling surprise. The second glitch only happens in the caves, which are the 3rd and 4th levels in the game. The cave walls are very uneven and blocky, over all very odd looking. It's not easily clear where you can fit through and where you can't. Quite a few times, I got a little too close to just the side of the wall when I was walking, and I immediately got stuck. I refused to start over, and so I would spend 10-15 minutes trying to get myself free. For anyone else who experiances this, first take off your helmet, and then repeatedly use a weapon (I found the dagger most helpful) to hit either above or below you while holding in the key to go backwards. It's very tedious and annoying, and there are no changes to show your progress, but all at once you'll be free. The very last time however, I got stuck for good and tried for probably a half hour to get out to no avail. There's nothing more frusterating then losing precious progress.\n\nThere are three other minor things worth mentioning. You collect gold, but you can't buy anything during that playthrough. Instead, the gold carries over when you die, and you can buy items the next round, before you enter the dungeon again. The way you leveled up bugged me. There are six different attributes, but when you level up, only three available ones show up, randomized each time. If you want to upgrade a certain skill, it often isn't there to choose. There are also different kinds of pressure plates in the game. Some hurt you, but one kind is a teleportation pad that will teleport you to a random place in the level. In all my time of playing, I have not once come across a single teleporter. I wondered if they had removed it in an update, but there are places in the level that you can not physically reach yourself.\n\nYou'll see in other reviews that this game doesn't have a lot of replayability. I didn't believe this at first, but it rings true. You'd think a game with randomly generated dungeons would have endless fun, but it actually gets old fast. I can't put my finger on as to why, but it does. Perhaps it's *too* simple, and needs something more to spice it up. It's still in it's beta state (at the time of writing this review) so I won't knock it off yet. It still has time to grow and evolve. I personally did not enjoy it a lot, but I feel like other players will get more, longer lasting fun out of it than I did because I'm very picky about dungeon crawlers. They are definately not my favorite genre, so that may have contributed to why I didn't enjoy this game more. For the record, this game isn't horrible or even bad. I just thought it was okay, and that's the only reason I'm not recommending it, but that's just my own opinion. It is surely possible to enjoy this game, so give it a try if you've had your eye on it.\n\n\n\nUseful guides:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=219609427\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=198620967  for the basic tips and inventory section\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=234835170  a more specfic, common strategy","June 28, 2014","false","8.0"," 31 of 46 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","31","46","0","0"

Even though death means you start all over, you don't have to always start completely from scratch, as you keep your collected gold and can buy powerful items from the start if you wish to do so, which is another thing real enjoyable about this game.

The combat is satisfying since enemies literally just obliterate when dying (and not to mention how bad I feel for the bats when they squeak). Some of the weapons and skills could use a description and perhaps there can be more interaction with the environment such as breakable boxes rather than unbreakable ones.

Definitely worth the $3 it cost.\n\nI wouldn't call it '3d' in more than a limited sense, it feels a lot more like Doom's 2.5d- 3d environments, sprite monsters, etc. Still, it's one save file you can't back up and one life in a randomly generated roguelike. It actually makes for a pretty cool story:\n\nI started off in a little camp with a couple of shopkeepers and the obligatory guest appearance of Old Man Exposition, who explained that there was a MacGuffin at the bottom of yonder dungeon. He also seemed troubled that people kept going in but never coming out. More on that later.\n\nSo I notice I have no gold, yet everything the shopkeepers sell costs gold. Okay, fine, we'll come sell some crap later. I head down the ramp, at which point the music changes to a far darker and more foreboding track. It was more apt than I realized, but I ignored it as I clicked on the door.\n\nTen minutes later and I'm about halfway through the first floor of the dungeon, packing my inventory with goodies to sell. You get a pretty generous inventory, and I was crammed to the gills with extra armor and weapons to unload. A quick glance at my map and I headed for the exit. Reached the door... and it's locked. The key is the MacGuffin. ♥♥♥♥.\n\nI do a quick Google search and lo and behold, there is no selling of items to shops- any gear other than the best stuff you've got is essentially dead weight. I tossed half my inventory on the spot and continued downwards, making it three levels before getting vaporized in a headlong hasted charge on a Beholder. Thus ended Game One.\n\nA couple presses of the Return key later and I find myself back in the camp. My inventory looks a little different- a different starting wand, a gold potion instead of a red one (the potions randomize their effects every game and you have to find out which is which by drinking them- and one just happens to be poison; the game really does hate you). And now I find out why there's shopkeepers: My gold carries over between runs, so previous me can give current me a head start with some gear and a stat point or two. As I got ready and drank my starter potion to find out what it was (arcane shield this time), I remembered the old man's words:\n\n"There's a lot of people going in, but nobody ever comes out."\n\nOver the next two hours I went in several times, and never came back out. Death happens a lot in this game- and usually right when you start to get cocky. I began learning to glance at my health bar every few seconds, more if I was in combat. Keeping myself in top shape was a priority- every level had its own special combination of ranged and melee mobs, and more often than not you'd find yourself beset by something with a sword that you'd have to kill while dodging fire from other things trying to vaporize you. Corners became my best friend- either because I'd lead the melee mob around them and out of the ranged mob's line of fire, or just as a place to sit down and cry now and then.\n\nSince it actually has a win condition, I can say I felt my pulse quicken and nerves get twitchier as I got towards the end. I'll try not to spoil much, but the game doesn't really get hard until AFTER you get the MacGuffin: now you have to get out. Oh, and did I mention that picking up the MacGuffin awakens the undead horde that's apparently buried under every square foot of this dungeon?\n\nFor the last fifteen minutes I was continually mumbling "oh ♥♥♥♥" under my breath as I dodged through the dungeon towards the exit with the MacGuffin, hoping I'd invested enough speed while leveling up to outpace the horde of undead nipping at my heels (I hadn't, one type of undead in particular is fast, flies, and will bite your face off if ignored). Having to turn to kill the speedy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ I almost instantly found myself swallowed by the undead wave advancing behind me, forcing me to burn my two most powerful wands to blow a hole in their ranks and escape. It's at this step that preparation becomes critical: I'd carefully and methodically laid a cache of gear for myself at the lower entrance to every floor; a wand, a health item, and some protective potions awaited me in the short breath I had while the skeletons closed in from the darker parts of the level. Dumped the empty wands, got some regeneration going, and off it was again to try and make it through Skeletor's Funhouse without joining the ranks of my would-be murderers.\n\nBy the time I got up the first floor again I was feeling good- I had a feeling that I'd be pretty worn down by this point, so I'd left an exceptionally generous cache on this floor. With no reason to hold back, I lined up every wand I had left and burned a path to the exit. Even then, so many mobs were in my way that I used up every wand and was still just outside the final room leading to the exit. The only mob in the way is one of the first-floor goons that happened to spawn, but my arrows were used up on the way down and my wands on the way up, leaving me with my trusty but oh-so-weak shortsword. I'd decided that I'd finesse my melee combat this playthrough, and as such had put all of my stat points into speed, magic, and health- I relied on careful maneuvering to win melee, a tactic you can afford on the way down.\n\nThis was not the way down. This was the way up, and I had enough undead closing in on me to make Left 4 Dead blush. I have 60+ hp and am regenerating, but while I brutally stab the mob in front of me to death my health bar is getting gnawed to nothing. I was in the single digits when my victim finally keeled over and died, leaving me to burst unopposed through the chokepoint, leave my undead pursuers behind, and have the most ♥♥♥♥♥♥ic door-opening ever as I got to the exit, barely alive but victorious.\n\nSo yeah, it's a fun game.

The pixel art, engine, and polish on this game are all very well done, and the beginning of the game left a pretty good taste in my mouth (which may be more than some people say for my game, Barony).

I have played little more than an hour of this game so far, but I can already sum up everything I have to say about Delver in one word: Potential.\nDelver is a fresh, unique take on the rogue-like games that have been pouring in recently from many indie developers from all over the world. It takes on many thematic rogue-like elements: It's challenging, randomly generated, and as fun as a bag full of rabid chipmunks dumped into an elementary school.\nI'm not saying this game is without its issues, but it's still in its early access phase, and must be taken with a grain of salt. Considering this fact, Delver is chocked full of endless potential. Its first-person perspective and highly pixelated environment and graphics allow this game far more room to breathe then one would expect at first glance. Even in its early phases, the amount of different consumable items and pieces of unique equipment are quite impressive, and the level-up system that resets after every miserable failure allows a very immersive RPG-like quality to the game. You're able to play differently every single run. Want to focus on high armor and melee combat? Go right ahead! Feel like going for a more mobile, long-range bow combatant? Be my guest! Or maybe you just want to pump all of your points into magic and blow the CRAP out of every enemy in sight with one of the many different elemental weapons in the game. Why wouldn't you?!\nIt is this amount of flexibility within a game that is comprised of so little options as of right now that makes me positive that there's no where to go but up from here for Delver. So many environments yet to be created; so many monsters yet rendered in that simplistic-yet-beautiful art style; many more items, potions, and pieces of armor yet to be looted off of bandit corpses or found in the dank corner of a cave! Heck, there is even a large part of the Delver community that claims this game has everything it needs to move on to an online co-op mode! Who knows?\nAll I can say is, that even after only an hour of gameplay, I can already close my eyes and imagine what can be done with a game this inventive, this creative, this simple, and this ambitious! If you haven't taken a peek at Delver yet, I suggest very highly, for the love of yourself AND your rabies-free elementary schoolers that you do. This game is nothing but raw potential and ingenuity, and I KNOW you don't want to miss out on it! That being said:\nThis is the Captain, Signing Out.","June 27, 2014","true","6.7"," 19 of 27 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","19","27","0","0"

The game is still in early access but I think it has potential. Unfortunately, it is very short ; you finish the dungeon in about 1 hour. The bestiary, weapons and the list of items are not very comprehensive. Fortunately, there are mods that add more diversity to the game. The soundtrack is very good and the retro style is great and there are texture pack if you want. The game has a level editor too.\n\nFinally, I would say that this game is not too worth it if you expect to spend long hours. But this game has potential, continues to be updates by the developer and for 7€ is cheap.","August 11, 2014","true","9.7"," 14 of 18 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","14","18","0","0"

I'm a pretty big NetHack and Speelunky fan and thought it was a bit too rough around the edges. After about 3 hours and a few levels down everything clicked. The item management and simple level up system really do have a sense of drama that feels more "roguelike" than I was expecting. I'm four hours into the game now and pretty pleased with it.\n\nThe game could use more items and item interaction, but in the state its in I can recommend it.","March 27, 2015","true","4.3"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","91","10","11","3","0"

And it provides that eerie feeling I remember from exploring the caves in the Minecraft.\n\nThe combat is simple, yet engaging. There is a variety of melee,  ranged and magical weapons available and balancing quick, strong and ranged attacks is the key to survival.\n\nThe graphics of this game are really appealing. While pixelated, they perfectly fit together to create a consistent "minecrawl" experience. Special mention goes to the utterly hilarious, 80-90s anime styled facial expressions the human enemies make when hit. Music is also likable and moody.\n\nWhat I didn’t really enjoy is the character leveling system.  While it is traditionally experience based, on every level the player is given 3 choices on what to upgrade. The problem is that there are more than three stats and thus sometimes there is no option to improve the desired characteristic and the  progress gets a bit random. Furthermore, there is no description regarding what a particular stat does. While most of them are self-explanatory,  a seasoned RPG gamer in me desires at least a basic defining of the difference between the Speed and Agility. Not much of a problem though – characters don’t usually live long enough to regret.\n\nOn the other hand, the game goes to the great lengths to make itself as user-friendly as the dungeon crawler can be. Traps are always clearly visible, and one cannot die of hunger, food restores the hit points instead.\n\nThe greatest problem with this game, at least for me, is the fact that it gets boring after a few runs. Nonetheless, it is perfect for the short evening sessions. Furthermore, when I decide to play a rogue it means something, since I’m usually too tired of starting over again and again in the real life to follow the same pattern in games. Still, Delver seems to be the right choice to spend a few nights with sword in your main and a glass of whisky in off hand. Yeah, I too used to play an ambidextrous character in the good, old DnD days.\n\nWersja polska\n\nDelver jest uroczym, małym dungeon crawlerem. Nie wprowadza do gatunku nic nowego, ale za to jest prosty, solidny i stylowy. I powoduje to samo osobliwe uczucie co długi spacer po jaskiniach w Minecrafcie.\n\nSystem walki jest prosty, ale wciągający. Gra daje do użytku spory wybór broni białej, dystansowej oraz zaklęć i znalezienie między nimi balansu jest kluczem do przetrwania.\n\nGrafika, mimo pikseli na pół ekranu, robi świetne wrażenie. Kolory są jaskrawe i dobrane tak, że idealnie pasują do tego „minecrawla”. Gra dostaje ode mnie dodatkowe punkty za miny które robią niektórzy przeciwnicy kiedy oberwą – przypominające anime z lat 80-90, potrafią naprawdę rozbawić.  Muzyka też od razu wpada w ucho i świetnie buduje nastrój.\n\nGra podpada za to sysyemem levelowania postaci. Tradycyjnie, opiera się on na expach zdobywanych na wrogu, a przy każdym levelu dostajemy do wyboru 3 staty które możemy „podbić”. Problem polega na tym że cech opisujących postać jest więcej, więc czasem nie dostajemy opcji ulepszenie tego co akurat by się przydało i sprawia że rozwój postaci przebiega nieco losowo. Dodatkowo, cechy nie są w żaden sposób opisane. Niby nie problem domyślić się od czego jest atak a od czego wytrzymałość, ale zatwardziały RPGowiec we mnie domaga się jednak wytłumaczenia różnicy między szybkością a zręcznością. Inna sprawa że nie jest to jakiś straszny problem – bohater i tak na ogół nie żyje na tyle długo żeby żałować dokonanych wyborów.\n\nZ drugiej strony Delver stara się jak może, by być przyjaznym graczowi. Pułapki zawsze są widoczne z daleka, a jedzenie odnawia HPki – nie można tu umrzeć z głodu.\n\nNajwiększy problem, przynajmniej dla mnie, to fakt że gra nudzi się dość szybko. Na krótkie sesje jest jednak idealna.  Co więcej, jeżeli polecam jakiegoś rogulca, musi coś w tym być, na ogół brakuje mi cierpliwości by zaczynać grę od początku po tym jak zginę. Podsumowując: Delver nadaje się idealnie do spędzenia kilku nocy z mieczem w jednej, a szklaneczką whisky w drugiej ręce. A co? Też grałem „oburęcznymi” postaciami w starych, dobrych, DnDkowych czasach.","October 24, 2014","true","3.8"," 17 of 24 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","17","24","0","0"

Put the contents in a pan buttered with "Dungeons of Dagorath" and into the oven pre-heated at 16-bit graphics and what do you know? You get THIS delicous nostalgic and exciting gem called "Delver".\n\nI just LOVE retro games, even though I didn't exist in the 80's or even the 90's. And you don't see tweens who would rather play Centipede than Call of Duty enough these days. (Maybe only where I live.) Anyways, the simplistic fun of those games just tugs at my heartstring. Everything from Coleco-vision to the Nintendo 64 I love. (And I don't think E.T. for the Atari 2600 is that bad either.) Well, I shouldn't say EVERY GAME or EVERY SYSTEM. (shudders at the thought of the Philips CD-i) But, I bet you get the picture. I was looking in the Google Play store on my tablet, searching "What other users installed" for Minecraft Pocket Edition. I scrolled WAY down until my eyes caught the glimpse of a simple 8-bit figure wearing a green shirt and holding a stick. I decided to check it out. Now what I DON'T like is a classic game ripoff. But I can't find a game in the back of my head that is almost exactly the same as the game Delver. So, I decided to buy it, hoping my money didn't go to waste. The description of the game is definatly true to its word, and I enjoyed it. Sure, there were a couple bugs in the game, and the controls were kind of awkward, I really love the graphics, the concept and, overall, the entire game. A while after that, I got Steam. When I discovered Delver was also on Steam, I couldn't be more excited. The controls were MUCH better than the version I had on my tablet. I just couldn't wait for the next updates.\n\nWell, that's my story how I found Delver, but then, there are also reasons I LOVE to play Delver.\n\nI've read some of the negative reviews on Steam, some of them complain that there is little story to this game. I could care less about a story than those guys. I would rather just play the game and explore a dangerous dungeon in which I would probably die a horrible death in order to get a useless item because "what the heck," than sit through endless cutscenes or do a lot of reading. The leveling up system is both very simplistic, but very effective and game-changing at the same time. The music is AWESOME! I could listen to the game's tracks all day. Getting to the Orb, the music is somewhat calm but suspensful and adventurous at the same time. When you go back to the surface, though, the music immediatly switches to all out frightening and suspensful, raising your stress meter. The abundant variety of weapons, armor, wands and the ability to hold something on your left hand is remarkable and you can't help but to be very stingy about the items you have in your inventory. You never know what the potions would do in each game, and which ones to drink or not. But as long as you know which potion is which in the earliest floors, The relevently small inventory space show that there is not a lot to spare and you need to be very conservative, in which I like. The easier reach to the Orb will make you feel that this game is to easy and you become cocky. But once you get the Orb, you realize that Delver's adventure is not yet over. You still need to escape to the surface. That's when all heck breaks lose. Enemies start to respawn, not to metion those annoying skeleton mages whose magic cooldown seems like a half a second. The difficulty gets much harder than ever before, and you have a very long way to go before you get to the top. The entire thrill and the adventure of the game captures my heart.\n\nThere are not many things for me to wish anymore about this game. Although, a few things doesn't mean anything at all, despite how amazing I believe this game is. Every once in a blue moon, the rest of the dungeon becomes impossible to progress and continue, which is very dissapointing the moment you discover it. On your journey to the Yithidian Orb, I noticed that enemies don't respawn. I would like the developers to add respawning to the first half of the game to make it a little harder, but not too hard though. When you get to the boss, I would like the boss fight to be nessecary to get the Orb. Plus, the boss fight is insignificant and easy. All you need wolf down an arcane and iron skin potion and you practically won the fight. I've also noticed a pattern that some of the rooms are exactly the same in other runs, and that more variety of rooms and maps should be added. Bigger and more floors would be nice, too. Other than that, I have no other complaints.\n\nI can't wait when Delver is going to be off Beta stage. I hope more people will come and play this wonderful game. Delver team, don't stop on improving the game. Please know that this game has HUGE potential and that there are fans, eager to play the game.\n\nWell, that's all I have to say.

It felt reminiscent of Daggerfall's dungeons or early dungeon crawling games of the 90s except with modern controls and pacing. This isn't a turn based roguelike, which is hilarious refreshing in what is one of my favourite genres now bloated with similar games trying to cater to people who only care about what I said above  (memes indie 16-bit roguelikevmetrovai- blah blah blah etc etc).\n\nThe aesthetics are crisp and colorful and some weapons feel weighty and it's very satisfying knocking out monsters or pesky mages into blood pudding. Also traps in the dungeons effect the bad dudes and I spent more than I'd like to admit trailing bandits into a spike pit.\n\nWhen you slap people's nuts a little too hard but not enough to put them down, they'll run off and try and flank/sneak up on you, which is cool.\n\nI put all my stats into defence and attack and wore big platemail armor.

One thing that I need to point out is just how beautiful this game is. The shape of the land isn't made of cubes like what you'll find in Minecraft, but it's all shaped to really make a dungeon, cave, or sewer scene come to life. The only thing that is cubey are the textures on the landscape.\n\nThe combat is simple but it isn't boring. You can choose to use a dagger, sword, longsword, club, bow, or one of the many magic wands that do different things. Like a true RPG, as you play you'll level up, you can power up stats (health, speed, etc..), and you will also find higher level armor, weapons, and enemies.\n\nThis is the perfect game for anyone looking for a rogue-like RPG dungeon crawler.\nDelver is worth the CDN$8.79 price.

There are definitely a lot of good things going on with this game, and it has the potential to scale into something truly massive and amazing over time. I haven't tried the custom mod tools yet, though I'm hoping they provide options to greatly increase the depth of content available.\n\nAfter finally playing through it in its current state, I feel like I missed something - or the game is missing something - because it took me all of 1.6 hours to learn the game and complete it (even the run back) and the lack of a meaningful ending left it feeling like a hollow victory.\n\nI'd really love to talk with the developer and community together sometime to explore the current state of the game, and determine ways in which Delver could be made more amazing and worthwhile for everyone to buy and play. I was hoping for something that scales more like Diablo, 20+ floors and constantly rotating out gear for better stuff throughout the game, multiple classes with variations, well-defined boss enemies, or just to have truly everything randomized and have every experience be a new adventure. Right now the potions and dungeon layout are the only things which change, the variety of loot is rather static, and I come in exactly the same every time.\n\n","February 24, 2014","true","5.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

They have NOT played it enough. I mean the guys have not even played 5 hours. So yes this game has not been updated since 9/20/2015, but if you take a honest look at what they have here its a near complete game. The only update it may need are a couple of bug fixes to things not even game breaking. I mean its not like cube world where there is nothing and might be abandoned. Cube world is boring and abandoned. This game is fun and might be abandoned. This game still has new things to throw at me and I have played 42 hours so far and thinking I've seen everything but then I made a new play through and boom I've seen a dungeon layout that I've never seen before. I even saw some treasure rooms and I'm like “Since when did delver have treasure rooms?” Put this game on your wish list and buy it when its on sale. This game is worth it.\n\nNow time to my actual review\n\nThis game is a throwback to how games used to be. Before story was added. Before you needed to know enough statistics you might as well get a fricken degree in the stuff. I thinking of YOU pokemon, I love you but my gosh your competitive play is just full of maths. Literally you wake up at a camp and need talk to some guys and walk into a door and boom your in the game. Your goal? Get to the end of the dungeon, grab the orb and get back to the start. Sounds easy right? Hah! Nope! As soon as you grab the orb, the quiet peacefull dungeon run you had on the way down, which I must say isn't very hard but just engaging enough to keep playing but at the same time punishes your mistakes, is now a absolute hell hole where you just want to survive the trek up. I make sounds of terror that I have never made before on my way up. If your an angry person, this game may not be for you just for this part. My gosh I love it. As soon as you grab the orb you see why this game is called rouge like.\n\nI rate this game 10/10 yes I really do, I don't care if its abandoned or not this is a good game.\nIf you don't want to buy it now put it on your wish list and remember it exists because you have no excuse to not buy this game when its on sale.

Despite some changes that were for the better, the game still hasn't managed to get better in terms of gameplay. The game still feels like a bare bones action dungeon crawler RPG with rogue-like elements thrown in. Though it is very nice that you now have more use for your weapons than just killing enemies (for example, breaking down a door with your mace or breaking a crate in order to search for loot), that skill jars now cost more and that there is more variation with the music, the game still has not advanced enough for me to say that the game is going somewhere. In fact, I think the game actually took some steps back, especially with its new leveling system. The new leveling system works like this: each time you level up, you are allowed to put one point into one of three randomly chosen stats. This is a problem because it doesn't give the player a choice on what kind of build they actually want to have, which defeats the purpose of being able to put stat points into whichever stats you want in the first place. Now, once again, one might bring up the skill jars, but I should not have to grind money, die a couple of times, and then buy all these jars just to get the build I want to have, especially in a dull game like this. Speaking of dull, the game is still a dull hack and slasher RPG with enemies who are not very competent at catching up with you. Combat is still virtually the same, scroll wheels are still not an option, the game still lacks custimization features, etc. All in all, the game may have added some neat things, but it isn't enough to save the game. I would still not recommend picking this game up, at least for now, that is.\n\nORIGINAL POST: Now that the October Patch is out and now that I've played some more of it, I will give my current thoughts on Delver. The good news is that the developer has revamped the RPG system. The bad news is that I still don't see it being a good game any time soon. My reasons? Lets start with the gameplay.\n\nThe gameplay of Delver may have been expanded upon when it comes to the RPG system, but the gameplay still pretty much sucks ♥♥♥. This time, the game has a shop and gold, and it saves your gold count when you die so that you can use that gold at the shop before entering the dungeon, which sounds nice, but can be used to break the game. How? By saving a ♥♥♥♥ ton of money (lets say about a little over a thousand gold) through multiple playthroughs and using that money to buy jars of skill, a type of item that sells for 20 gold and levels you up upon use, you can easilly kill the difficulty. Some may argue to not use them, seeing as they are optional, but they are in the game, and I feel that they shouldn't be that easy to get, seeing as this game is supossed to be a difficult action rogue-like RPG. In terms of combat, I think it's actually clunkier than the last time I played it, especially when it comes to the hit detection. There were moments in the game where I was hitting enemies, but the hit didn't register for any good particular reason. This was especially common with magic attacks. Speaking of magic, for some reasons, magic weapons seem to be quite overpowered, killing a lot of enemies in one hit. The game also has moments of being unbalanced, as I've had moments on the first floor where I got killed in one hit. The developer still hasn't added the ability to use the scroll wheel, which is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, considering how many other First-Person RPGs make use of the scroll wheel to change weapons and items. The game also still likes to spawn very powerful equipment in early stages, though not as often as it did when I last played it, so that's a plus. In the end, however, the bad still outweighs the good, and Delver still feels like a generic Action-RPG with nothing going for it.\n\nPresentation wise, the game has made drastic changes with its visuals, and although I'm not too fond of these new visuals, they are ♥♥♥♥ tons better than the graphics that Delver used to have (seriously, those graphics were an eye sore). Music wise, Delver still has that god awful dungeon music, although the update added a new tune that is more pleasant to the ears to fit the shop camp that is outside the dungeon. An improvement in these areas, but they could still be better.\n\nAnd now, the performance. I don't know about anyone elses experience, but I found that the game is glitchier then when I last played it. Yeah, not a good thing at all. I had one moment in the game where I found a bow that was floating midair, and I couldn't take it for some reason. I even have the image to prove it. The game also loves to close on its own, as the game closed on me while I was in the dungeon. Also, the game is still unoptimized as ♥♥♥♥.\n\nDespite its improvements, the game is still rather ♥♥♥♥♥♥, and I still think that people should avoid this game at this point in time.","October 26, 2013","false","5.6"," 20 of 37 people (54%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","54","20","37","0","0"

And I have to say it's really really fun, even at such an early point in development. It was incredibly tense when I was fighting my way through the enemies in an attempt to reach the surface, using what small resources I had left after getting to the bottom of the dungeon.\nAnd the gameplay is just what I want from this kind of Roguelike, you have to learn everything and aren't spoonfed information, you'll have no idea what a Potion does until you drink it, which is great, you can be on very low health and be in the situation of "If I drink this potion will it heal me, or kill me".\nLearning how attacks interact with each other is fun as well, I used a potion on a Pressure Plate and it exploded, which led me into learning that hitting a potion on the floor turns it into a bomb, very useful considering how far you can throw items. Or that if your Magic Attack hits an Enemies Magic Attack, it will explode both and deal AoE damage. The only thing I never actually figured out was what the Agility stat did.\nThe graphics, which some would call "Lazy", fit the style and genre of the game perfectly because in a Roguelike you don't want to be overloaded with details you want everything to be fairly simple, but good looking, which is what this game achieves. While the graphics aren't realistic, they present a great atmosphere for the game and really help with immersion.\nThe Music is also good, it just quitely sits in the background and blends well with the ambient sounds, not drowning out anything important such as the movement or chatter of enemies.\n\nThings I would like to see in the future of this game are:\n- More varied qualities to accessories, weapons and armour. Like qualities that affect gameplay in a more meaniingful way than just stat changes. Depending how it would influence how the game plays.\n- Perhaps a way to make potions, using ingredients that you don't know what they do until you use them.\n- Perhaps a way of recharging wands, as I tended to end up carrying 6 wands around and throwing them away once one ran out. That would mean making wands a bit rarer though.\n- Some ways to specialise as a character, maybe a class system that have different starting stats and items?\n- And maybe... mod support if possible? When the game is finished of course.\n\nOverall though, even lacking some of the things I would like, this game is incredibly fun and I will probably continue to play it for a while, especially as more updates come.","March 20, 2015","true","4.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I have played a little over an hour or so, and I can safely say that I'm glad I bought this game! It will bring back memories to the people that have played Eye of the Beholder, Wizardry and other first person dungeon crawlers. Personally, it reminds me a little bit about Heretic, but that's maybe because of the "crunchy pixels".\nDon't get me wrong - I LOVE the graphics! These days there are alot of indie games that use pixel art graphics, but few have done it as good as this game's artist. I have seen the previous art for the game. It was cool, but now this current pixel art is awesome!\nI'm at level 7 of the dungeon on my first go and what I can say is that it really gets tough after the first few levels.\nBeing an early access game, Delver lacks some cool features that will be awesome if implemented, but that doesn't have to stop you getting it. Updates will bring you new stuff, so don't hesitate.\n\nOne sentence opinion: Awesome game!

I think this was money well spent for the hour or so of enjoyment I got out of the game. Even buying it at full price, it would have paid for itself.\n\nThe combat is pretty basic but it works well for the slow paced combat. The visuals are very reminiscent of Minecraft along with all the controls. The inventory system works well for allowing you to collect loot along your trip down the dungeon and the randomized potions give a little risk to using them each time you restart, which is frustrating but in a good way.\n\nAs for faults, the level/stat system is a little broken as you only need to put points into health for the first five levels and defense the rest to become relatively hard to kill. Ranged combat versus flying enemies, which is when it's needed, is a fools game unless you're using a lightning wand (almost hit scan), as projectiles have travel time and flying enemies juke around way too much to predict their movements. I just found myself running up under them and stabbing upward for a sure hit.\n\nFinally, while I died the first time down the dungeon due to trying to figure out the system, I beat the game on the second try. I received a slash screen of text and then the game treated me like I had died. I'm pretty much not going down a third time until there are further updates, but as I said at the start, I got my money's worth already and I recommend a purchase, especially if it's on sale again.\n\nTL;DR - It's an enjoyable game but has it's issues.

A combination of the music, the art, the very simple UI, and carefully timed, if simple, combat hit me right in the nostalgia.\n\nCurrently it is in beta, and there is much content I have yet to explore, but there is only one shortcoming I see so far.

Then upon realizing it was a first person rogue-like game and not the typical side scrolling one, I had to get it.\n\nThe game looks and play beautifully, I changed the key bindings a little more to my tastes but it probably won't bother most on its default settings. On the games website you can buy a HD Sphax PureBD pack (You might recognize the name from the popular Minecraft Texture pack) for $4.90 (2.90€).  The game should be able to run on any computer than can use Steam, due to the simplistic graphics and the slider in the menu.\n\nAs far as the Rogue aspect of the game, it does it a little differently than say, Rogue Leacy. In that game, you only get the gold from each run to spend as you have to spend it all to enter the castle. But in Delver, you keep all of your gold from each run, but lose any equipment that you got. But once you buy something, you always have it, which is nice. You level up in the dungeon and have a series of classic RPG stats that you can increase, but Health should always be your number 1 priority when leveling as it was the only one that had a major difference to difficulty/gameplay. I got lucky on my longest run and found a warhammer with long reach and high damage. The wands you find will be very useful and they are the only way to get passed something that can happen in the game. Speed is probably the least useful stat in the game especially when matched against Health. I'd like to see a little more depth in the stats.\n\nI really didn't notice any bugs that stopped my progress in the game and I could honestly see this game, in its current phase of development, packaged as a full game, I would certainly buy it again. 10/10 and good on the Devs.","January 1, 2014","true","2.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

What?! Arrmageddon is near! Human sacrafice! Cats and dogs living together! Mass hysteria!\n\nIn all seriousness, Delver is a fun dungeon crawling rougue game. The dungeons are randomly generated each time you play making the replayability value high. If you die, you start all over, new dungeons and a new character, but you keep the gold that you find during your last quest(s) so you can purchase weapons, armor, potions, and spells to aid your new character. If I can compare this game to another, Delver reminds me of Ultima Underworld.\n\nIf you like rougue-type games, this is a must-buy!","August 19, 2014","true","15.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

A fresh take on the rogue-like genre, being in first person. Started out as a post on tigsource, updating almost every day. Now on steam early-access, with sparse updates.\n\nPros:\n•Of all the rogue-likes I've played, this one is probably the most achievable whilst still being difficult.\n•Variety of weapons and other helpful items that you can dual wield, with an alright variety of monsters and terrain.\n•A nice atmosphere, without a simple story to discover through notes on the ground.\n•A hack 'n' slash, but very well done in first person mode.\n•Simple, but very replayable.\n\nCons:\n•Horrible, horrible, textures, read below for info on how to get past that.\n•Somewhat disappointing boss, which can be good for those who aren't up to the challenge. Just don't get hit, which is pretty easy.\n•Once you kill the boss, you have to work your way back up the 8 floors you just traveled, which can be somewhat boring.\n\n8/10, but if you want to enjoy it, get the official texture pack that has the original textures from the game when it was on tigsource, which are far better than this crunchy-pixel crap. The texture pack is updated with every update, and has optional "mods" that slightly improve generation.","January 4, 2015","true","10.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I don't regret buying this game whatsoever, and the fact that it's early access leaves me excited and wanting more. When I think of a really good indie game, this is literally the first game that comes to mind now. If you enjoy any sort of dungeon crawler, you will love this game immediately.

Currently you can buy items from it using gold you obtain from enemies. At the moment, there is an item called "Skill in a Jar" that levels you up and is fairly cheap. If you get enough gold, you can level yourself up an absurd amount of times and become so overpowered that the game is no fun. However, as long as you avoid the shop, you should have a lot of fun.","November 27, 2013","true","1.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I've come to realize that I love rogue-likes with a simple design.  The systems don't have to be complex to make the game good, there is depth in how you decide to build your character and how you play.  I just really enjoy playing games like this and Spelunky where it is all about exploration and how you adjust to your environments.  This game just kind of boils down what I love about Spelunky and dungeon crawlers into one delicious gaming soup of goodness.

It's rather basic at the moment, being early access, but for eight dollars, the amount of content and effort that the game has is really impressive, and it feels very focused in its design. I can see the reason people compare it to Ultima Underworld, since much of the game's gameplay and style are clearly very inspired by it - the first one in particular, I mean. While the combat focus is very fun and the graphical style is really appealing, I actually consider the level design and generation to be the highlight here: I don't know whether it's due to working with a 3D space or whether it's simply the sheer amount of rooms and halls and things that the team have made, but in the handful of runs I've played so far, they've all felt similar, but all memorably unique thanks to how everything is built. It's a roguelike capable of creating really cool vistas, structures and views, while also making those distinct in gameplay terms as well (the dungeon is inhabited and has lots of humans and recent structures, the caves are very jagged with lots of nooks, the sewers are a mixture of open yet linear due to multiple heights, etc), and that's something to be applauded.","December 6, 2015","true","7.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It brings a true feeling of dungeon crawling. Do not be fooled by the pixelated graphics, the game looks stunning. The combination of sprites across the areas make for gorgeous scenery. The enemy sprites are easy to identify and well made. The soundtrack gives a nice feel of adventure. The music remains noted in its glory, but does no distract you from gameplay. The items available are plentiful and well made. The combat is simple enough to adapt to quickly, but still poses some danger when performing it. The game relies heavily on exploration. Notes found in the beginning town give basic instructions to gameplay and an extremely brief lore description that strangely leaves you wanting more, despite being shorter than a paragraph. Not in a long time have I played a game like this, capable of delievering a real feeling of adventure, as well as giving satisfying emotions when discovering new loot.

The 16-bit enemies and environment add a classic feeling to the experience almost as though the game was once in a fourth directional dungeon crawler like "Link to The Past". The randomized floors just add a bit more of anticipation to each floor. each enemy is unique in its own while still keeping a theme throughout the game. overall it is just an enjoyable experience and i always look forward to each gameplay and that is why i recommend this game to any interested.

The game itself is a dungeon rouge-like, but is a first person game. One could say that Delver resembles Minecraft in quite a few ways, and I don't disagree. But, it's far from another Mincraft clone. The premise of the game is simple, the difficulty is not. As of this writing, the dungeon consists of seven levels/floors, each randomly generated. One must make it to the bottom, then return topside with the treasure, with various enemies being thrown at you along the way. However, the game does become monotonous at times, just to let you know. Again, it may sound like a cake-walk to some, but it really is the opposite. And although I'm used to multitudes of horror films, I jump every once and a while as a turn a corner.

It was somewhat interesting, but rather shallow and not very difficult. The player goes down a few floors of a dungeon and then picks up an orb that's guarded by a rather unintimidating boss (I had no idea I had killed him). After you grab the orb, you make your way back to the entrance, which you can basically just rush using a hammer. Bow and arrows are extremely buggy, bouncing all over the place and phasing in and out of reality. While it's an interesting set of ideas, it's extremely slim on content and I feel like I saw the majority of it in two hours, as layouts didn't really seem to change much between my three attempts at getting the orb. I don't think I've ever beat a rougelike in three tries before. I think my opinion on the game would change if they vastly expanded on it, but it looks like it's been in this sort of shape for a while according to the forums.","April 10, 2015","false","1.9"," 36 of 72 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","36","72","0","6"

Delver has it. It's deceptively simple; three equipment selections with apparently-linear upgrading; you only choose whether to equip heavier armor at a loss of speed. Amulets and rings? Straightforward. Weapons? Same deal, though they can be enchanted for bonus elemental damage. All in all it seems like the sort of game you can fully-understand in 30 minutes or less.\n\nAnd then, on your second or third play(or fourth or fifth), you get far enough. And you realize there's a *purpose* behind what you're doing. Me, I thought you just got to wander, fight things, find gear, and satisfy that itch to hoard, but there's more! And if you thought it was hard going deeper and deeper.... just wait for the trek back up. But that's all I'll say, as I don't want to spoil anything.\n\nDelver is already well-worth the $7.99 it's currently selling for. The visuals are simple and remind me of Minecraft(despite not actually adhering to the same visual format at all), the sprite style is deceptively innocent, colors are vibrant and the lighting is very complimentary to the atmosphere. If you're like me, you'll find yourself creeping, ears sharp. What was that noise? Where did it come from, exactly? What made it??\n\nLike I said, it's worth the small price tag, and that's when you know an Early Access game deserves to be Early Access. This isn't a case of "well, it's probably gonna turn into something great given time!" at all. Delver is great, and if you want to pick it up now and get your money's worth early-on, then you'll already have it as it continues to grow bigger and better.

Take whatever you expected from a first-person hardcore roguelike, throw in graphics that are extremely difficult to appreciate on larger screens (2K and higher) and obfuscate everything with a fiddly RPG system that seems to be taken out of games like Bloodwych or Eye of the Beholder but without any lore or explanation along the ride.\n\nAnother "coulda been good" until the "money dried up" cliché.","October 5, 2015","false","0.5"," 10 of 21 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","10","21","0","0"

The thing is, it has a serious lack of content. I would only reccomend this game on sale beceause spending 8 euro's on just two hours of gametime is not worth it in my opinion (a friend of mine completed the game in 0.9 hours without rushing it).\n\nThe graphix style is amazing. I am a fan of game design in general and this has a serieus amount of potential. The main problem with the game is, as mentioned, the lack of content. As you enter the first dungeon, 'Dungeon 01' will appear on your screen. This gave me the idea there are at least 11 dungeons. Wrong. There is only 1. One single dungeon with only nine floors.\n\nIf the devs would add at least 10 more dungeons of different styles, I would change my opinion. For now, do not buy this game unless you are curious about the design and need an hour to kill.\n\n3/10, potential but propably dead devs.","October 7, 2015","false","2.1"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

I can't recommend this game for over $5 mainly because of its lack of content.  Level-up's are decently-timed, but stat increases often mean nothing (dumping points into Health = always winning).  The game needs to be much longer, and stat increases need to have a much larger impact on the game and its enemies.  You often find yourself randomly finding a nice strong sword within the first few levels and watching the game become extremely easy thereafter.","June 17, 2015","false","3.6"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

It's a very straightforward and fluid experience. The combat is fast, smooth and fun. The loot is plentiful and interesting.

Strong monsters are deadly accurate with attacks and are intelligent. Casters will avoid melee and attempt to kite you. Melee enemies will attempt to flank you. Your skills will be tested and it honestly feels like a match of Quake 3 at times.

It suffers from being a bit weak in scope, but the gameplay is tight. The ending is unbearably annoying, and only has one real playstyle you can do to beat it. I can only suggest the game for $2 or less.\n\nIf you've ever played a "real" rogue-like, like Nethack (or other ASCIIs) you'll be very disappointed. The game is incredibly limited, the "RPG" element is ultrabasic, with only 2-3 stats actually being useful. There is no character magic, and the game scales pretty linearly. I actually got more out of building up in the first or second dungeons, because while deeper levels bring harder enemies, the rewards are worse.\n\nThe author put in official mod support, though there is no Steam Workshop. I did not try any of that.\n\nNote on other's reviews: Only the first and second dungeons are "procedurally generated" in the normal sense. The others are randomized, but not completely random.

From the flickering of a torch to the pixilated blood splattered against the wall after a heated battle.  As a  36 year old gamer , this game takes me back to the golden era of the great RPG's , an era unfortunatly that has been long forgotten.

I enjoyed the hours of playing in Delver. The best part for me was the environment. It’s what I fell in love with and sadly the only part I fell in love with. Since it’s still under development, I have high hopes for Delver. Respawning when you die with just the starting items and the low reward for getting further into the dungeon kills half of the fun for me. The challenging aspect of Delver was perfect. It did not give you a easy run in any aspect so you really had to work for that extra exp or extra gold from the enemies inside the dungeon.

I bought the game on sale and I do not regret my purchase. No onto the review.\n\nThis game, while being described as an action roguelike, is not a roguelike, but a rogue-like-like. It has some roguelike elements but it's missing some of the soul and core mechanics that roguelikes are supposed to have. That doesn't mean it's a bad game, but you should consider this before buying.\n\nThe basic concept of the game is simple: Delve into the dungeon, make it to the bottom, grab the treasure and escape alive. There are enemies and traps along the way to stop you of course, and the twist of needing to escape with your life adds more difficulty and stress to an otherwise easy game. If you've played a lot of rogue-like-likes before you shouldn't find it too hard to make it to the bottom and beat the boss, but making it back should prove a lot harder.\n\nBesides the dungeon, there is also a camp area. The camp area lets you spend your collected gold after you die to start off a run with an item, or items. These items should not be ignored and can give you a very helpful early game advantage. This is a good touch, although I wish more was done with it and the NPCs there. But remeber: The game is still in dev.\n\nOverall I'd say Delver is a potentially deep and interesting rogue-like-like with cool ideas, and is worth sticking with for the features planned in the future. The developer has plans to add a lot more depth in items, magic, enemies, character classes and even an overworld with NPCs.","January 6, 2014","true","3.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Making your own dungeons gets a little boring after a while since it is 2D. Weapons are limited as is inventory, so some inventory management is needed during gameplay. Shop at camp needs improvement as far as buying and selling items (NPCs are nothing more than area-specific menus). Graphics have been improved a bit, but applying Sphax's pack adds higher resolution textures to the game (though it will remind you more of Minecraft as it does share some of the same textures). Overall, a good game but after a few runs it gets boring fast. Pick it up if it is on sale and you are bored.\n\nGraphics: 7/10\nSound: 7/10\nGameplay: 8/10\nReplay Value: 5/10","December 22, 2013","true","2.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

And I have concluded the game is very good mainly due to its simplicitic combat and leveling system and I feel the simple economics of risk and reward is what keeps me coming back :). However the game does have few issues, such as a lack of a save function. I didn't think this was going to be much of a problem but as the dungeons are very long, I found myself reluctingly sacrificing my progress to take care of my responsibilities in the real world, which is obviously quite frustrating. The only other con to the game is I found the pressure plate traps to be too powerful- but I guess thats personal preference.

Minecraft style 3-D dynamically generated roguelike. There is a good selection of weapons, armor, and monsters, and every game is different.  Some interesting mechanics, and the gameplay is solid.  I like that this game doesn't try to do too much, it knows what it wants to do and it executes perfectly.  Graphics are functional and the art style fits the game well.

It has nothing to do with the game being in early access. The general design choices are horrible. In a good roguelike you can just start playing, clear the levels and have fun.\n\n"Randomized levels - never the same game twice" should actually say:\n\n"Randomized levels - almost never get past the first few levels, because we randomly swapped out your starting healing potion for an instant death potion, and we randomly replaced the low level monsters with monsters that have undodgeable ranged attacks that 1 hit kill you."\n\nBesides the bad use of randomization the entire combat system is "Hold down left mouse button, let go when neer enermy".\nEnemy ranged attacks are completely undodgeable because arrows and magic attacks fly faster then bullets. Even worse If you hit, or the enemy hits you is done entirely behind behind the scenes with random rolls based on your stats.\n\nThere are no choices in classes or races or any way to make your character special. You start with a dagger, a wand with 6 charges, and two completely random potions. You cant buy anything from the shops and you have to go right into the dungeon, and you cant come out until you clear it. You also cant sell anything and there are poison monsters on the first level that will drop your HP down to 1 if one of your two random potions was not an anti-poison potion.\n\nIn short, the game is bad because whether you win or lose is entirely dependent on luck, and not player skill.","April 8, 2014","false","0.6"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"

However, combat is unnecessarily difficult (no cursor, no knowledge of enemy hitbox). Most attacks that "should" hit end up missing, which very well may be a game mechanic.

Full keybinds are tough to figure out without a controls page in the options.

The game allows little room for building your character as you progress, and you are left at the game's mercy when it comes to gear. As you progress deeper into the games dungeon, your play style will rely almost solely on what weapons and armor you find and your luck with the random level generator.\n\nStill, the game is a real-time roguelike experience, and much like classic roguelikes, you will often find yourself backpedaling into doorways while trying to kite varied and numerous enemies. It's easy to catch yourself reserving all of your ranged attacks (wands rely on finite charges and bows rely on a rare stock of arrows) for dire circumstances, while searching constantly for a better melee weapon. Armor can be hit or miss, and is often a trade-off between movement speed and protection (both of which are very effective).\n\nFrom death to death, your gold will carry over. The only opportunity to buy items and spells is at the beginning of each run.

Sure, it has a great combat system, loads of items, and heck, even a great boss fight! However, this game consists of many flaws that ruin the gameplay.\n1. No Jump Buttons\n2. Bats that have the glitchiest movement patterns in any game.\n3. Crazy damage after picking up the Orb, I had full platemail and 60 health, but monsters were still dealing like 6-8 damage! Not the melee, I was fine with that, but the mages were just shooting spell after spell after spell, you couldn't even say "I'm dead" before you're dead.\n\nThis is supposed to be a rogue game, but only problem. UNFAIR CHALLENGE, you want something fair? Go play Crypt of the Necrodancer, and avoid this abysmal failure for "challenge".\n\nP.S: This is Early Access, so it will have bugs, but this is way TOO many.","July 22, 2015","false","2.8"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","2"

It wont stick to one style. Sometimes going for the Doom esk Paper Mario style and other times just pooping out huge blue crystals in old polygon style textures.\n-Gold carrying over playthroughs is the only real reason to play this over again which gives very lackluster items.

It isn't a roguelike which they try to market it as (disgusting and misleading marketing there). It's more of a first person RPG game, but one where you don't select class, one where you don't feel unique at all. The maps aren't random enough, they feel the same, enemies are way 2-dimensional. When it comes to enemies, the graphics of wolfenstein 3d are way better than paper thin enemies in this game.\n\nSome mechanics remind me of Amulets & Armor, which I much rather recommend to try out than this game.

You descend 6 levels, have to pick up an orb, and re-climb them all to get out. When you pick up that orb, you have to deal with infinitely re-spawning enemies throughout the 6 levels, and all the care and patience you took in dealing with them before flies out the window. You leveled only health and made sure I had the best weapons, armor, and healing items you could have before taking the orb. It does not matter. You are swarmed with flying skulls that you cannot outrun and must fight. As you do so, Skeleton mages bombard you with magic from beyond the game's very tiny draw distance, and you die. In a game about resource managemeant and dungeon delving, rushing things leads to death, and the game forces you to do so.\nI do not recommend this game, and doubt it will be fixed.","December 2, 2014","false","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

The areas are generated randomly, and each level you have to build up your character choosing between three random stats (exemple : you have to choose between health, speed and agility).\nThis is exactly what I was expecting about the game. This is currently the 0.7, so it's likely the game will get deeper. Just take the game for the atmosphere (the game is really REALLY beautiful if you love the old school graphics), the gameplay (potions on the ground explode when you hit them, the traps can be activated with beer mugs, just so you know), and the difficulty (even first fights are easy, the game will kill you at any mistake you will do).","December 30, 2014","true","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The combat isn't anything to write home about, but certainly keeps things entertaining as  you journey through randomly generated dungeon mazes.

If you are a dungeon like person I recommend you buy this. DONT BE FOOLED BY THE PIXLE GRAPHICS! Even in beta stage it seems like basically a finished game to me. The dungeon layout of the maps is almost different everytime I play it. It has a variety of choosing your skills every time you level up.(Strengh, dexterity,defense etc.) THis game is not easy to beat! It feels like the pixle version of dark souls in my opinion! The battlesystem of this game is very basic yet fun. This is a type of game that you will not (in my opinion) see every day as it is cut down to the basics.

I've spent quite a bit more time on this game than Steam says, on both my Mac and PC and it runs perfectly on both. Which is saying a lot when most games can not run more than 20fps on low graphics settings on my Macbook Pro. You can hardly tell that this game is still in alpha as I have not come across any bugs or issues. The only issue I have with this game is the fact that when I die I lose all of my stuff and any of my upgrades and have to start from the beginning. I understand that this is a feature of the game, but I would really love it if the developers made a game mode for players like me who do not really enjoy perma-death games and would rather have a fun dungeon crawler where I can save my progress. I would still recommend this game to anyone looking for a fun little first person dungeon crawler.","January 8, 2015","true","0.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Is that a skeleton mage? Oh crap, I have to get across this pulley, please don't be a mag- Oh good, it's a warrior. I'll just activate the pulley and shoot at him with my wand. Steady, Aim, Fire!"\nAt that point, my character, level 11 with 30/35 HP remaining falls over, dead from the spell he just shot. The spell was an Ice Blast, a blue slow moving ball that was capable of doing 13-30 damage. Unfortunately, the spell was slower than the pulley I was riding to cross a gaping chasm that the game generated with its unique random dungeon generator. Basically, I spit against the wind and it smacked me in the face.\nI had collected the orb guarded by a skeleton king and escaped the familiar halls that I had once traveled. Any enemies spared from my golden fire mace greeted me with open fangs and drawn swords alongside the army of skeletons so intent on retrieving what I had taken. I was so close, only for me to fall victim to own spell.\nAt this point, many would be furious. Sure, it's a light rouge-RPG and death is to be expected, but the fact that a spell from your own wand killed you would be enough for most to say the game is horrible and broken.\n"You shouldn't die from your own attack, that's common sense." One would imagine.\nBut in this case, it isn't. As I descended through the dungeon I would occasionally find these weird eye demons that would hurl themselves at me, shooting fireballs that would make quick work of any would-be adventurer without the proper gear and lack of decent footwork. Once in a while, these demons would be going so fast, their demise wouldn't be by my hand, it would be by their own as they would smashed into their conjured attack. I would laugh, grab any loot dropped and move on. I ignored the fact that an enemy could be hurt by their own spell. If an enemy could slay themselves, why would it be any different for me? Why should I be exempted from this rule?\nSo I had to learn the hard way by adding my corpse to the body count of the dungeon. All that progress was now lost. The past hour, gone because of a mistake I should’ve recognized.\n9/10\n","January 9, 2015","true","3.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

THE GAME IS SUBJECT TO CHANGE IN THE FUTURE.--\n\nNow, I shall get all of the potential negatives out of the way first. Yes, the game is light on content. With only a few enemy types and one dungeon, skilled players may find themselves quickly consuming all the game has to offer. That, and some occasional bugs that very rarely appear but can be annoying sometimes.\n\nWith that all said, this game is brilliant value for money. £5.59 for a game as addictive as this is a steal, and in my opinion the dev could get away with charging a little more. The pixel art aesthetic is pulled off expertly, as so many other indie dungeon crawlers are from a top down perspective or 2D, it's refreshing to play a FPDC (first person dungeon crawler). The potion system in the game gives a tense atmosphere when you are at low health, having you gamble with fate as you could consume a health potion, or get a poison debuff alongside many other potion effects. Combat is very simple, but this works in the games favour as it makes all combat encounters very quick, which is essential as it makes runs shorter going hand in hand with the permadeath mechanic.\n\nAll in all, for the stage it's at now and the price tag it has, this is a great game, and with more content on the way, I highly recommend you buy it now.\n","October 18, 2014","true","2.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's like playing a classic roguelike, the only difference being it's realtime and combat factors in your skill. Combat plays very similarly to Skyrim, and once you understand how to move and chain your attacks I think it's a very solid system.\n\nIn terms of loot and magic, it's good. Once you get past the first three floors you will start finding more interesting pieces of equipment.\n\nGraphics are simple but they have a lot of work behind them. Art and lighting are very nice.

The design of the rooms is very good, though the game needs more variety, still. The only outside area is the starting point, unfortunately. Going underground, there are the dungeons. Then there are cavey caves. Then there are sewers. Then there is lava...you'll have to play for more details. There are bottomless pits, pulleys and levers, keys and locked doors, doors that you have to bash down, secret doors, and trap-plate traps (teleporter traps are kinda annoying).\n\nMONSTERS:\nThe monsters seem to fall into a few categories, which are perfect for the gameplay setup. There are fast dodging monsters (bats, flying skulls), typical meaty melee fighters (thugs/bandits/giant spiders), jumping melee fighters (they jump at you when you get close, hard to time attacks), and magical ranged fighters. Perhaps there should be some physical ranged monsters or magical melee ones? There probably will be later. The monster difficulty balances well with player development and the combat shines.\n\nGAMEPLAY:\nGetting onto gameplay, most everyone else has already mentioned it, the combat is very decent and straightforward; melee weapons are more dangerous to use because you might be hit (and starting out HP is very scarce). Thankfully they don't break over time like other games. Ranged weapons are bows and arrows and wands that have limited ammo. Though missed arrows can be picked up, wands never recharge. As it is a roguelike, don't expect ammunition to be too plentiful, especially for the late game. Potions are random but scrolls are not. Potion effects take about 2-3 uses to learn what they are (which I think is dumb because the player can remember them...and after playing a few times having to re-remember just gets annoying [Note to the maker: can we have it be just one potion use == in-game player learns it?]).\n\nPLAYER DEVELOPMENT:\nFor character development, as far as I can tell, in the late game, increasing your attack or magic seems worthless. If you are good at predicting monster movements, even if your attack is low, you can take as many hits as you want without getting hit. Near the end of the game, no matter how good you are, once you start getting swarmed by mage-skeletons and flying skulls, you're gonna get hit a lot, so my advice is put most of your points into speed, health, and defense. If you ever get swarmed well...RUN!\n\nMY MAIN THOUGHTS:\n1) Magic is a stat that seems mostly useless, I can't imagine relying on wands near the end game when there are a lot of monsters but probably not nearly enough dropped wands, nor inventory space to hold them. Same with arrows. This is a minor balance concern that can be directly adjusted, but what I'd really rather see is a more traditional MP and learned spell system, also wands that recharge for those who are not magically-inclined.\n2) I 100% wish the game wasn't just a roguelike and was more developed as an RPG. The music, graphics, and engine are so awesome, I don't want my game to end just because...I won. I want more. I would pay a full $60 to play just a Diablo clone with this engine, graphics, musical, and dungeon layout feel.\n3) So, I was looking at the development log and there's an awesome overhaul coming to the editor. Until it comes, the current map editor is essentially unusable and the assets needed to mod the game aren't readily available so it's not really even close to being as moddable as I'd hoped. My main reason for buying this game is cause I heard it was uber-moddable. I hope as it develops the assets are more open. Modding is what opens small games like this to the masses and makes them become legendary.\n4) I am in love with this game. It is very charming.\n\nPros:\n- Fast, easy to learn, first-person roguelike\n- Good music and graphics schemes\n- Fluid gameplay, sensible difficulty\nCons:\n- Needs more content\n- Without modding, little replay value","January 23, 2015","true","4.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You descend 6 levels, have to pick up an orb, and re-climb them all to get out. When you pick up that orb, you have to deal with infinitely re-spawning enemies throughout the 6 levels, and all the care and patience you took in dealing with them before flies out the window. You leveled only health and made sure I had the best weapons, armor, and healing items you could have before taking the orb. It does not matter. You are swarmed with flying skulls that you cannot outrun and must fight. As you do so, Skeleton mages bombard you with magic from beyond the game's very tiny draw distance, and you die. In a game about resource managemeant and dungeon delving, rushing things leads to death, and the game forces you to do so.\nI do not recommend this game, and doubt it will be fixed.","December 2, 2014","false","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

In it's current state as a roguish minecraftian, doom wanna be it is great, but as everyone else is saying; it's short and there is not alot of content. Delver is the kinda game for an old schooler like me who luvs art. In it's presentation there is alot to award it for in the visuals department. The music is good too. Yet there is alot missing to making it shine and become a trully remarkable game.\n\nThe addition of more levels25+  and larger ones at that. Increase the encounter enemy roster list(put some frign orcs or goblins and trolls in later levels) and include more secrets and activation items. Offer the plaeyers random merchants in the levels and saving or rescuing npc's.\nThe attacks with melee weapons need to change....more speedy slashes, stabs, and bashes. Tooooooo sssslllloooowwww right now.\nRefill crystals randomly placed for recharging wands or refill gems that can be used to recharge.\ntreasure chests or loot bags that contain treasure, traps, or monsters. (BAG OF BATS!!)\ndual wielding or shields for opposing hand.\nSlimes that crawl flat to the floor\nblade traps that swing out from walls or floor\nspike traps or pit traps that drop  players to doom or next floor.\nDoors that shock or attack(slam into players)..."vile doors" indicated by two small cracks in upper part that act as the doors eyes.\nCrafting(nothing grand)just simple crafting that enables players to build pots, empowered weapons and equipmen.\n\nI do like the suttle changes that have occurred within th elast six month...such as breakable crates, caverns changes, monster sounds, addition of pillars, etc.\n\nOverall I will recommend this roguish game on the basic grounds of a low price tag, btu I recommend the devs putting more content in the bag so to speak like I suggested then they'll have a sleeper hit many a gamers can't deny has a great appeal and charm.\n\nNice jpob devs, but please offer us more.","August 10, 2014","true","10.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Its been in production for three years and seems like it has a lot to go to make it interesting for more than a couple runthroughs. Random Dungeon Crawling Rogue-Like Game. Its missing something big and its a combination of the mechanics and lack of really any substance that wont let me enjoy it as much as I feel I could.\n\nPros: Completely random dungeon that works well. RPG Elements. Roguelike, so you never know what you're getting or if you have any chance to succeed. Money Carries over after you die.\n\nCons: Unrefined interface, no story, visuals are hard on eyes trying to focus between like the 16 bit characters and semi 3D environment, been in development for a long time. No real drive to play through more than a few times.\n\nOverall, i'm not sure what can be added to make it more interesting. The Dev is looking for feedback, but the biggest thing would be to fix the cons. Not sure you you do that with the short playtimes. Why are you there, what are you doing, what is driving you, who are these people, what is the reward, what do I do with all this broken and useless stuff you accumulate, are some good questions to start answering.\n\n-Comiccom\n\nwww.thecomic-community.com","March 22, 2015","false","4.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This isn't as much a review as it is my thoughts on what the developers should change, as this game is still in development and has frequent updates (which is awesome. frequent updates are awesome.)\n\nI love the art, although it's a little low res for me. Doom, the game this game's 2D-sprite-in-a-3D-world style is based off of, has higher resolution sprites and textures than this. I understand it's going the retro pixel art route, but it's honestly just kind of lazy to have characters this low resolution. Also, the blood is a little rediculous to me. Everything about this game screams "E for Everyone" then you go ahead and have these really stupid looking blood puddle decals that are left wherever you kill an enemy. I'm not saying this game isn't fit for kids, but it just looks odd and out of place. Either go a mature route and make the characters and art more realistic or take the blood out.\n\nThe combat is kind of wonky. You hold down Left Click to charge up your attack, and the longer you hold it down the more damage it does. So you can either stab an enemy a bunch of times or give them a couple big, strong slashes. I understand what they're trying to go for, they're trying to make the combat more intuitive, but it doesn't work, mainly because you slow down when you charge your attack. So If you're trying to charge your attack you end up walking painfully slow towards your opponent, and I can understand it's for balancing purposes, but it honestly is just annoying and slows down combat.\n\nAnd probably the most annoying part about the game so far to me is hit detection. Since the characters are 2D sprites instead of 3D models, it can be really hard to tell if you're close enough to them to attack, and often times sword fights just turn into me slashing into the air not close enough to hit them, then moving closer to hit them and getting hit. It's especially annoying with enemies that don't actually attack you, they just touch you and you get hurt, because you're trying to get close enough to hit them but instead of hitting them you get too close and get hurt.\n\nI don't really like the music much, but I'm sure a lot of other people like it so I won't tell you to change it or anything, so I just turn the music off. But when you do that, you pretty much hear the torch noise on infinite repeat. It's understandable, because the game takes place in a dungeon lit by torches, but it's so, so incredibly annoying. Either turn the torch noise down, add different ambient noises, or make better music. Any one of those options would be awesome. Besides that, though, the sound effects are awesome.\n\nAlthough it has a couple minor problems, it's still a really fun game, and I recommend it. The magic in this game is really awesome, the feeling you get casting spells in this game is really unique, and the AI isn't bad. The level design is solid, but this game could definitely use some more rooms, I run into the same rooms fairly often. Bottom line is, it's a fun game that has potential to be a great rouge-like.","September 14, 2014","true","3.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

What more could you possibly ask for? You have your expected gold currency with a shop at the start for extra loot after you got your ♥♥♥ handed to you last game - maybe it's just me; you buy it and tell me!\n\nEither way, it's randomly generated, entertaining, and simple enough for even the most basic and recreational gamers you can identify. I mean, giant white text that says "YUM" pops up when you eat something. How ♥♥♥♥ing great is that?\n\nNot to mention that everytime you play, the map is regenerated, so you can just play over and over and lose your ♥♥♥♥ in this gut wrenchingly, childbirthingly, universally cathartic experience that has manifested itself within these breathtaking 32-bit pixels that move jovially at thirty frames per second to my tiny, childish hearts content.\n\nSeriously, it's so good, I made up words for this review.

It's an FPS roguelike. Others exist, like Paranautical Activity, but I would call that more of an FPS of Binding of Issac, while Delver is more of an FPS version of Nethack. I love Nethack, and have consequently played far too much of it. This solid FPS roguelike will actually fill that same itch in a fresh new way.\n\nThe graphics may be offputting, being that they belong more in the Doom era of gaming than they do today, but it is definitely excuted well. And I also do believe that it fits the style of roguelike very well, while allowing the devs to focus on other core gameplay features. And that's where this game really shines. It's built solidly. It may not do a whole ton of things. But the things that it does, it does fantastically.\n\nI believe that if this game were to become as popular as the Dungeons of Dredmor, it could bring in a whole new legion of roguelike fans, as DoD did before it. If procedural generation and first person cameras are what you like, give this a try.","August 19, 2014","true","1.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A hit on one of the side panels will force it to pop off and give the player a free shot at the other side; a hit forcing the sail off becalms the ship for a turn.To add to the pirate flavor, each player also has an eye patch. Wearing these will slightly affect depth perception and add a marginal bit of sport to the shooting.This game retailed for the somewhat impressive sum of $16 back in 1962. With its huge plastic ships (close to a foot long), giant vinyl play mat, and the eye patches, it may well stand as one of the more overproduced games of the early 1960s.","January 8, 2014","true","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Reach bottom of dungeon; 2. Grab shiny orb of arbitrary unexplained power; 3. GTFO while being pursued by respawning enemies). However, Delver is a much shorter and more straightforward game, and is a real-time roguelike rather than a turn-based one. But despite, or perhaps because of, its short length (7 floors, easily completable in an hour or two) it is incredibly fun. It has the right amount of RNG; enough to keep things fresh with new layouts and items, but not so much that you can ever really get wrecked by random factors beyond your control. Every run feels winnable; every death feels like it could have been avoided if you had just played better. Plus it has a level editor now, and is still under active development, so there's lots of potential for more things in the future.","April 13, 2015","true","15.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Attacking, either with magic, a melee weapon or a bow (when you find one) is simple but satisfying with the casual nature of the game.\n\nLoot is plentiful and  takes after the genre of roguelikes because items must be used to figure out their effects. The simple hotbar system popular these days lets you see what your useful items are but provides challenge at later levels because potions and scrolls don't stack, leaving you with the choice to equip the scroll of resist magic you might need or the extra healing potion so you don't die.\n\nEasy to get into, and hard to pull yourself away from, Delver is a diamond in the rough and offers fun in spades for casual dungeon crusaders.\n","March 28, 2015","true","7.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is one of my favorite games in my Steam library. There are only 8 floors (I think) but you can get so many different items. Example: Daggers, shortswords, swords, maces, longhammers, wands, leather armor, chainmail armor, steel plate armor, shield, lantern/candle. There are different variations of those. You could get a worn iron shortsword that does crap damage or you could get an excellent gilded engraved longhammer that's a one hit kill weapon. The items look really cool too. Think of it as a rogue-like, improved and pixelated Skyrim.

So, I set out and invested many hours exploring that place, combatting all manner of terrors in pursuit of a goal that quickly slipped from my mind and escaped beyond the shadows my meager light could not uncover. It's been many years since that time, and I grow weary to make another attempt on that place. But, now I hear rumor of another ruin, filled with treasures and fiendish traps, as well as maddened explorers who have become trapped in that place.

I see great potential in it! I dig the graphics and really feel this game has huge potential IF the developers  take the time to go the extra mile and give this game more depth.  As it stands now, I have no need to ever re-open this game.  The randomization gives some replay value but after you have seen all there is to see... why continue playing?  This game needs new rare-rooms monsters items\n\nI would also love to see something carry over from your previous life.  A mode to let you keep your stats after each death would be cool! Of course the game would get very easy over time as you get stacked up, but if it was never ending (Or super long) with much harder dungeons and monsters and more epic gear to collect it would be a great way to get you ready for those levels.\n\nAs it stands now though- I paid 4 bucks- (On sale) and I feel satisfied with what I paid and played.  If this game was more detail rich with deaper levels of randomization and variety, Id pay 10-15 and play for hours and hours.

I've had a ton of fun with it so far, and I'd recommend it to just about anyone. Right now it's pretty small, but I have high hopes for it when the full game is released.\n\nThe combat is very reminiscent of Minecraft, especially the swords and bows, though somewhat more complex. Elemental magic wands are an interesting option, though they're all basically the same. Enemies don't seem to have resistances or weaknesses, and there are no additional effects like the fire wand making enemies catch fire. Still, this is obviously an area the developers plan to expand on in the future, so I'm excited to see what they might add to the combat system.\n\nThe visuals are really great. There's a satisfying feeling in smashing an enemy backwards and watching him burst into a shower of red pixels, and the various enemies and environments all look fantastic. I was pleasantly surprised by the variety in the different dungeons you trek through. Cave levels are uneven and winding; a sewer I found myself in seemed extremely linear at first, but turned out to have tons of little alcoves and branching paths. Enemies all attack in similar ways (charging forward with melee weapons or shooting magic), but at this point in development it's nice to have some various enemy looks.\n\nHonestly, this is a great game by itself. It just needs more... stuff. More content. The levels are pretty linear overall, and the end goal is fairly simple. Some other objectives could be fun... you could happen upon a corpse, with a clue that a great treasure lies hidden nearby. Find it, and you might be rewarded with some powerful armor, or a legendary magic wand. Special named weapons and armor would be so fun to collect, it would keep you coming back into the dungeons for more. I'd also love to see bigger levels, with multiple parts.\n\nAs of right now, this is a great base for a game. Once they add more content, supporting the already great gameplay with some additional items and places, this could become a favorite.","June 26, 2014","true","3.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You descend 6 levels, have to pick up an orb, and re-climb them all to get out. When you pick up that orb, you have to deal with infinitely re-spawning enemies throughout the 6 levels, and all the care and patience you took in dealing with them before flies out the window. You leveled only health and made sure I had the best weapons, armor, and healing items you could have before taking the orb. It does not matter. You are swarmed with flying skulls that you cannot outrun and must fight. As you do so, Skeleton mages bombard you with magic from beyond the game's very tiny draw distance, and you die. In a game about resource managemeant and dungeon delving, rushing things leads to death, and the game forces you to do so.\nI do not recommend this game, and doubt it will be fixed.","December 2, 2014","false","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

The design of the rooms is very good, though the game needs more variety, still. The only outside area is the starting point, unfortunately. Going underground, there are the dungeons. Then there are cavey caves. Then there are sewers. Then there is lava...you'll have to play for more details. There are bottomless pits, pulleys and levers, keys and locked doors, doors that you have to bash down, secret doors, and trap-plate traps (teleporter traps are kinda annoying).\n\nMONSTERS:\nThe monsters seem to fall into a few categories, which are perfect for the gameplay setup. There are fast dodging monsters (bats, flying skulls), typical meaty melee fighters (thugs/bandits/giant spiders), jumping melee fighters (they jump at you when you get close, hard to time attacks), and magical ranged fighters. Perhaps there should be some physical ranged monsters or magical melee ones? There probably will be later. The monster difficulty balances well with player development and the combat shines.\n\nGAMEPLAY:\nGetting onto gameplay, most everyone else has already mentioned it, the combat is very decent and straightforward; melee weapons are more dangerous to use because you might be hit (and starting out HP is very scarce). Thankfully they don't break over time like other games. Ranged weapons are bows and arrows and wands that have limited ammo. Though missed arrows can be picked up, wands never recharge. As it is a roguelike, don't expect ammunition to be too plentiful, especially for the late game. Potions are random but scrolls are not. Potion effects take about 2-3 uses to learn what they are (which I think is dumb because the player can remember them...and after playing a few times having to re-remember just gets annoying [Note to the maker: can we have it be just one potion use == in-game player learns it?]).\n\nPLAYER DEVELOPMENT:\nFor character development, as far as I can tell, in the late game, increasing your attack or magic seems worthless. If you are good at predicting monster movements, even if your attack is low, you can take as many hits as you want without getting hit. Near the end of the game, no matter how good you are, once you start getting swarmed by mage-skeletons and flying skulls, you're gonna get hit a lot, so my advice is put most of your points into speed, health, and defense. If you ever get swarmed well...RUN!\n\nMY MAIN THOUGHTS:\n1) Magic is a stat that seems mostly useless, I can't imagine relying on wands near the end game when there are a lot of monsters but probably not nearly enough dropped wands, nor inventory space to hold them. Same with arrows. This is a minor balance concern that can be directly adjusted, but what I'd really rather see is a more traditional MP and learned spell system, also wands that recharge for those who are not magically-inclined.\n2) I 100% wish the game wasn't just a roguelike and was more developed as an RPG. The music, graphics, and engine are so awesome, I don't want my game to end just because...I won. I want more. I would pay a full $60 to play just a Diablo clone with this engine, graphics, musical, and dungeon layout feel.\n3) So, I was looking at the development log and there's an awesome overhaul coming to the editor. Until it comes, the current map editor is essentially unusable and the assets needed to mod the game aren't readily available so it's not really even close to being as moddable as I'd hoped. My main reason for buying this game is cause I heard it was uber-moddable. I hope as it develops the assets are more open. Modding is what opens small games like this to the masses and makes them become legendary.\n4) I am in love with this game. It is very charming.\n\nPros:\n- Fast, easy to learn, first-person roguelike\n- Good music and graphics schemes\n- Fluid gameplay, sensible difficulty\nCons:\n- Needs more content\n- Without modding, little replay value","January 23, 2015","true","4.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The best part is even if you get bored of it now, in a month or two the game will have changed so much that its almost a new game all by its self.\nHave fun!","February 15, 2014","true","12.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Sure the gameplay was simplistic, but that was to be expected. So a few years later I was kinda suprised that when I found this game was on Steam, as I handn't heard anything about it for a long time. So I bought it, and was amazed with what the game had become. The textures had been changed from 8 to 16 bits, and are really well designed. I'm also loving the tons of new enemies and weapons, as well as the possobility of shops in the overworld now. Admittedly the game is still pretty hard the further you go, so I have yet to have enough gold to test these shops, but it doesn't take anything away from the gameplay. On the note of difficulty, I'm also not sure of how many more dungeons they've added (There was only one in alpha, but that's definetly changed). There are a few issues here and there, (Throwing a fire wand into the water broke the sounds for me) but this game is still in early acess, so that's kinda to be expected.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ContraZombie4/recommended/249630/","ContraZombie4","ContraZombie4","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ContraZombie4/","23 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nDelver is a fantastic game of procedural dungeon crawling, satisfiying real time combat, and exploration. Delver contains smooth RPG-like combat, where by charging your attack makes it more likely to hit your target (guarenteeing a hit when fully charged); a mysterious setting of an anchient tower holding one of the greatest treasures known; and oogles of replay value.\n\nEven though the game is currently in Early Access Beta, it feels well polished, and expertly crafted. Every update adds in more generation to every level in the game, and there are very few if any bugs to be found. The game has a very fair-unfair bipolar, in the early levels, the enemies are relatively easy to dispatch, but if they land a hit, it can take a sizable amount of health away; and towards the end, your going to run out of health a LOT.Delver is a relatively short game; you trek through 10 levels per playthrough of ever increasing difficulty, fight and defeat (as far as I am aware) a single boss, and make an excruciatingly hard, and harrowing journey back up to the surface from whence you came.\n\nThe final level is the MOST unfair and difficult level in the game, and is probably the one and only constant level throughout your journey, as it appears unchanged through each playthrough. It introduces several enemy types not seen before on any level, and ALL of them hit really, really hard. I have never successfully managed to beat the final boss, and have only made it to him twice.\n\nAll in all, it is very challenging, and you will die a LOT, but it never feels like you couldn't stop it from happening. Delver is an incredibly fun, semi-addicting, dungeon crawl with danger lurking around every corner, and an unfair boss level.","August 16, 2015","true","6.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The new areas are frickin creepy. The AI now shoots at you from accross the area which was totally unexpected.  The loot drops are more balanced.  The enemies get more difficult as you progress.

Yet, it's a roguelike that is very easy to learn. It perhaps sacrifices some management depth to instead put more bang into the actual action parts, with interesting charge attacks that require you to time your movement to land your blows. Then there are some bugs, some rare instant unexplainable deaths, alt-tab fullscreen issues. After a certain point, enemies start appearing everywhere and even in front of you, in a way that feels... a bit cheap. But - it's not finished.\n\nIt's rather short, and I like that. Hopefully with time, the shortness of it will be compensated with variety each playthrough. I've only played it 3 times, beaten it once (failed to beat it on my second playthrough due to instant unexplainable death), and all the times felt... very similar, but not identical. Not much reason for me to play it again at this point once I've beaten it right now.\n\nDelicious graphics. I've always loved low res pixel art because it gets my brain working to fill in the gaps and to create detail where there is none and makes at least me actually immerse myself far more than in "HD" games.\n\nAnyway - it's fun as it is, and I'm looking forward to future updates.","January 5, 2014","true","3.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This puppy's more a dog for fans of Ultima Underworld, for those familiar with the game, than someone looking for a first-person, cartoony Diablo. Which *was* the developer's goal and they need to be commended for their efforts: the game, for what it is, is in my opinion a good but (right now at least) somewhat limited game, and one that's still in development besides. See if you like any of the free rougelike games out there- if not Rouge itself. See if you like games with very little plot to speak of (Doom did have a plot; Super Mario Bros. 3 as well). Read up on Delver and games like it just a bit. And thenm when you're ready, take the plunge: $8 is really quite a deal for a charming little pick-me-up game like this (relatively easy deaths means this game is "just one more try" obsession-ready, so bear this in mind too).

Its graphics are very sharp and appealing. When you die, you have to start the game over again. Combat is interesting, but, at some times, extremely repetitive. The potions give random effects determined at the starting generation of a new game. Enemies are cool and have slightly varied ways of combat. You can level up and use points to upgrade certain skills, and weapons vary a fair amount.\n\nShould I buy it?\nYes. It's a great game, and new content is confirmed to come, but the game get's boring after five or so hours of total gameplay. You can easily mod the game with new weapons, armor, dungeon rooms, enemies, meshes, items - pretty much everything! The community is very small, and I hope it grows more soon.\n\nRating\nI'll give Delver an 8/10.\n\nIt's great for short, 45 minute bursts of gameplay, but any longer can often get boring. A few mods are being developed, one of which is a desert crypt dungeon mod which has an early version you can play. I really hope the developer, pardon me forgetting his name, adds more content soon, seeing as the game, once you beat it, gets boring after a while.","November 17, 2015","true","35.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Not a big fan of perma death and then having to re-do everything but hoping on full release there can be an option to play without that or some way in the game later to retain stuff. I have a feeling the games not meant to be played without perma death though. I see you keep your gold upon dying, so each time it would get easier to fight as you could just buy some better items at the start but that would make it more repetative and for someone who is a big RPG fan I hate the thought of losing all my progress and having to do it again - that been said. It's a game I would recommend at the cheap price.

The games has a lot of potential, and if the dev continues  with the game, I think he is going to make something really cool.\n\nPros:\nNice music\nA lot to explore\nMap is randomized, you don't have to walk through the same thing over and over again if you die\nNice textures\nA lot of different textured mobs you meet along the way\nAlways something new to explore\n--------------------------------------------\nCons:\nThere are basicly 2 types of weapons.

The core mechanics of a "game" exist but it's not fleshed out or given enough attention to be memorable or worth the investment of a 30 minute or more run. The randomness is great at first but you see the same entities many times over with no payoff. There is purposeful stage overlap and retracing to gameplay which isn't a problem, but I wish it was more engaging than "just run". The game world is supposed to be alive around you but it feels frankly as if it never lived at all. If the developers add more content (better starting hub, etc) or find a way to make the current content better(more carry over from each run) maybe it'd be more enjoyable.","November 6, 2015","false","6.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There are a variety of weapons and items to find and use, with potions' effects changing for each playthrough. Though its replayability is not as great as I expected, Delver stays fresh and fun for many, many hours. Its random dungeon generation does provide for a unique experience for each individual delve (heh) into the deep. Overall, this is a very solid game. Heck, this thing is still in Beta.\n\nI can say with absolute certainty that I thoroughly enjoy Delver, and I cannot wait to see what the final product will look like.\n\n9.5/10","June 28, 2014","true","9.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

When I first started playing the game I thought of it as tedious and unoriginal. Boy was I wrong, it only seems like alot of other games untill you get further in the dungeons. I had my heart skip a beat at every corner in the sewers. The way that a spider from across the map can echo deep into another part of the cave is spinetingleing. And since once your charecter dies you have to start over you can become legitamently scared for your pixelated life. A few problems I have had though are that the hardest enemy in the game can be bats. They take a lot more hits then they should be able to and have drivin me insane in the deeper levels. This game is glorious and would benefit greatly from Co-Op Multiplayer. But even as a single player game this is a must buy.","June 28, 2014","true","0.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Of course I have only played 2 hours, but I suspect plenty more hours of fun coming out of this game. And they enemies are so unique throughout the game, at first it just seems like the enemies are a Mage, Warrior, and some Noble of some sort, but the enemies get WAY more developed throughout the gaming experience. You'll find it really easy to love this game, and the leveling system is great, you cant just MAX out health right away, you have to upgrade other things too, beacuse it doesent always give you health in the 3 choices you have.....

It sits comfortably halfway between Daggerfall and Doom.  Gameplay is still fairly rudamentary but it's shaped up significantly from the old alpha project.  Combat feels more fair and the itemization is rather generous if you take the time to check each nook.  The music gets a bit repetative, but it's still well done (particularly in the escape).  Hopefully more room blocks will be added to the dungeon layouts, however.  In my limited playtime so far, I encounted the same piece of sewer layout linked to itself four times in a row.  Some further stylization of the dungeon would be nice as well, to help differentiate it from all the other blocky games that have filled the market in recent years.  We'll see what future updates have in store for it, but as it is it's still well worth a look for fans of the genre.","December 2, 2013","true","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I love the graphical style and the music. It's a simple game that has great potential and I hope that it will be continued to be expanded by its author. As it is, it's relatively short. I finished it on my third try. The first time I didn't know what I was doing and died quickly. The second time I was more careful and made it to the end, but didn't realize I was near the end, and so I died again. The third time I was prepared, and beat the game. The gold / buying stuff is handled in an interesting way; the gold you collect can only be used to buy things in the NEXT game you play. So while you don't keep levels, items, etc after you die, you do gain an advantage the next time. There are a few annoying things, which will hopefully get fixed in later versions. Some are glitches, like enemies getting stuck in walls. Others are interface things; I found switching between weapons in the middle of combat didn't always work as well as I'd like. However I'd say that Delver is worth buying ... I probably won't play it again until it's next update, but I'm looking forward to doing so.","December 6, 2013","true","4.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There's no reason to have shop keepers at camp because you buy anything in the beginning nor can you really sell anything.

Having to budget health for gauranteed damage from traps in a roguelike is like trying to pay your mortgage payment with dryer lint. You just don't have the ability to do that. However, I will be willing to play the game some more if I discover that was a very uncommon situation; IE, up until the point I encounter that problem again. If you enjoy roguelikes and you really liked the Might & Magic 1st person adventure games, you'll enjoy Delver.\n\nUpdate (Spoiler Warning): It is possible to deal with most traps without stepping on them even if they are between you and the path you need to go down, but there are still areas and configurations where they will always hit you, even if you try to disable them.

Love it, most of the other enemies drop coins or potions or minor weapons and armour. But these guys seem to carry a large mace around with them! lol\n\nThe envronments are well crafted and quite large. The new maps make the trek more of a challenge as they tend to loop around and take you to cliffs and dead ends sometimes as they are not always straight forward to getting you around the maps.  Also  the maps are randomly generated with a pemadeath element so your never going to have the same playthrough twice as even if you get the same map the items and enemies have also changed and moved around.\n\nThe weapons are a standard mish-mash or the usual sort, dagger, sword, hammers, maces and axes, aswell as a few wands. Leveling up is random, your given a choice of 3 skills out of about 6 or so to level up so your not nessasarily able to just level one skill at a time.\n\nIve played through multiple times and had a blast everytime, 10/10 for this one excited to see the changes as they happen\n\n\n","June 25, 2014","true","14.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Combat is smooth and complete, level design is intriguing, loot is exciting and scarce, randomness of potions is a beautiful mess and overall, this game is pure amazement. Keeping it simple all the while making it more fun. Skills are gained, weapons and armor have stats and enchantments, precious rings and amulets keep you on a search and nomming a slice of bread or cheese once in a while keeps you wanting more. Enemies are interesting to fight as dodging and timing of hits play a key role in the combat system, and not to mention the limiting factors of bow ammunition and wand charges. This is a great game that has undergone a lot of hard work by some very good people, and I'm sure this game is going no where but to victory and improvements on gameplay and story.

The art style is beautiful, the combat is fun, and the Roguelike elements are pure and well implemented. At the time of this writing, Delver is an Early Access title.

I think it would be nice for there to be more variety in the environments and enemies as you decend through each level of the dungeon.\n\nAs a lifelong fan of Roguelikes, I can safely say that Delver is a great example of the genre.

I have a feeling the games not meant to be played without perma death though. I see you keep your gold upon dying, so each time it would get easier to fight as you could just buy some better items at the start but that would make it more repetative and for someone who is a big RPG fan I hate the thought of losing all my progress and having to do it again - that been said. It's a game I would recommend at the cheap price.

Attacking, either with magic, a melee weapon or a bow (when you find one) is simple but satisfying with the casual nature of the game.\n\nLoot is plentiful and  takes after the genre of roguelikes because items must be used to figure out their effects. The simple hotbar system popular these days lets you see what your useful items are but provides challenge at later levels because potions and scrolls don't stack, leaving you with the choice to equip the scroll of resist magic you might need or the extra healing potion so you don't die.\n\nEasy to get into, and hard to pull yourself away from, Delver is a diamond in the rough and offers fun in spades for casual dungeon crusaders.\n","March 28, 2015","true","7.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I've spent quite a bit more time on this game than Steam says, on both my Mac and PC and it runs perfectly on both. Which is saying a lot when most games can not run more than 20fps on low graphics settings on my Macbook Pro. You can hardly tell that this game is still in alpha as I have not come across any bugs or issues. The only issue I have with this game is the fact that when I die I lose all of my stuff and any of my upgrades and have to start from the beginning. I understand that this is a feature of the game, but I would really love it if the developers made a game mode for players like me who do not really enjoy perma-death games and would rather have a fun dungeon crawler where I can save my progress.

However, I know it is still only in early access but I think there needs to be a few things added, such as a slightly larger array of weapons, Toning down the OP-ness of Enemy Magic attacks (Seriously, it will kill you almost instantly with about three hits, when melee attacks to you would usually take only about 10 hits or more) A little bit more variety of elevators and/or secrets such as Buttons to uncover a secret passage, keys to open doors, Maybe add in chests for items, SUPER (That's right, different from the normal!) Secrets, a slightly more diverse Enemy Encounters, Like, more enemies, then again, there is a good selection of enemies already but eh. I don't think maybe adding in the ability to Jump in the game would be a good idea, leave that out, it's a dungeon crawler, no one can jump while crawling. (lol)\n\nWhat this game is strongest in however is the difficulty, already mentioned how OP enemy magic attacks are, and that needs to be toned down ever so slightly. The sense of exploration is there and is great, the Music (Or ambient noises I guess) REALLY Immerse the player into the game, seriously, sometimes I even get shivers being creeped out, it gives you a sense of danger and fear, Afraid to turn a corner, there have been times I have been jump scared in this game because of the noises almost sounding like they bounce off the walls of the rooms. The inventory system is pretty good, you open the Inventory and the game does not pause, I like that, it gives the player a sense of panic, ESPECIALLY When you are trying to get out a potion of healing (You hope as the potions are randomized each time you play) which means you setting up your inventory bar is CRUCIAL in this game. A thing I would like to see but I kind of have gotten used to, is the ability to use the Mouse Wheel, as haing to use the 1-6 keys on my keyboard have more than once caused me to use a potion when I wanted to use my magic wand.\nThis game is FREAKING AWESOME, if you were ever in the times of floppy disks, and played those old dungeon crawlers, and love rouge-likes, and having to fear for your life because there is perma-death in the game, this game is your new best friend!\n\nI have a couple of videos so far on the game and making a Let's Play on the game!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5-wPdHgBWk\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COnzuENBzds","October 27, 2014","true","19.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The environment is my favorite thing about the game it reminds me a lot of dungeons from the "Legend of Zelda" series. The reason this is is because there are levers with moveing platforms and a plethera of different traps to avoid.\nPlus if you played Zelda as a kid the nostalgia is there belive me.\n\nNow for the bad, I have only been playing for about two hours so far as i've said earlier and I have seen a lot of bugs.\nThese bugs were not game changeingly bad but were pretty annoying. But before I tell you these bugs I would like to clarify that this is an early access game and is not yet fully refined, so please do not judge the game on what im about to tell you im stateing thes bugs simply to inform the developers and anyone who does not want to play an unrefined game.\n\nBugs iv'e seen while playing:\n\n1: Sometimes when getting chased by enemies They get stuck on ledges or in tight spaces this is seen most often in the caves with the bats.\n\n2: Occaisionally when I throw items out of my inventory they clip into the walls and make an obnoxious noise until i leave the floor and when i come back its still happening.\n\nThese are the only bugs that ive come across so far otherwise the gameplay is nearly flawless.","January 25, 2015","true","12.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you've got the cash and want to play a fun and intense little rougelike go for it.\n\nThat said, having very nearly beaten it on the first run(almost got back to camp with the orb) I will echo my fellow reviewers in saying that anyone with decent rougelike and/or first person shooter experience will smash on it. After I learned the hit distances for the melee and found a murdereously awesome jeweled dagger the only challange was escaping with the orb, which does just seem like an increased spawn of skeletons from the last level "chasing" you out the way you came in.\n\nNow, having said all _that_ I'm circling around to the first point.

Heartily recommended.\n\nPriority Interrupt describe Delver as having "crunchy pixels", but I'd say that adjective can be applied to the game as a whole. This is a good solid game with a lot about it to like, that you'll be happy to sink your teeth into.\nThis is one of those games with the benefit of simplicity - with familiar controls and clear, uncomplicated mechanics, it's very easy to get into with a learning curve you can get to grips with good and quickly. But it's also one of those games that's easy to learn, hard to master - as you'd expect from a permadeath roguelike, it presents a decent challenge that favours a tenacious and moderately tactical playstyle, but never feels overly unfair.

Sure the gameplay was simplistic, but that was to be expected. So a few years later I was kinda suprised that when I found this game was on Steam, as I handn't heard anything about it for a long time. So I bought it, and was amazed with what the game had become. The textures had been changed from 8 to 16 bits, and are really well designed. I'm also loving the tons of new enemies and weapons, as well as the possobility of shops in the overworld now. Admittedly the game is still pretty hard the further you go, so I have yet to have enough gold to test these shops, but it doesn't take anything away from the gameplay. On the note of difficulty, I'm also not sure of how many more dungeons they've added (There was only one in alpha, but that's definetly changed). There are a few issues here and there, (Throwing a fire wand into the water broke the sounds for me) but this game is still in early acess, so that's kinda to be expected.

Reach bottom of dungeon; 2. Grab shiny orb of arbitrary unexplained power; 3. GTFO while being pursued by respawning enemies). However, Delver is a much shorter and more straightforward game, and is a real-time roguelike rather than a turn-based one. But despite, or perhaps because of, its short length (7 floors, easily completable in an hour or two) it is incredibly fun. It has the right amount of RNG; enough to keep things fresh with new layouts and items, but not so much that you can ever really get wrecked by random factors beyond your control. Every run feels winnable; every death feels like it could have been avoided if you had just played better.

Get the orb and do your best to escape alive, because everything comes back at you threefold once you pick up the darn thing. The first-person perspective, coupled with a few small corridors and narrow walkways, really give you a mild sense of fear and excitement--you never know what's going to jump out from behind the wall (hopefully not a magic-user).\n\nThe game is pretty short. For some players, you could run through the whole thing and escape alive in only about 3 attempts. But don't let that deter you, as it is a lot of fun regardless. That being said, I would strongly suggest picking this game up when it's on sale, as there is a lot to be desired. Still, it IS Early Access...\n\nAlso, sometimes I feel like I'm being cheated.

They're 3d 16 bit, nothing fancy, but they work. It definitely adds to the retro feel.\n\nThe gameplay is the same first person dungeon exploration that harkens back to Ultima Underworld. It's balanced and challenging. There is a learning curve but you will find yourself delving deeper on each try and more importantly, wanting to try again after each death.\n\nThis is one of the few perma-death games that get it right. It isn't frustrating but also is not easy.  Don't get me wrong, one moment of stupid can cause a restart but the build to your character is balanced with the difficulty in such a way as to make you avoid mistakes and almost always understand exactly why you died when/where you did. This balance is what makes me want to keep coming back and keeps me trying to delve deeper into the dungeon and hone my skills.\n\nI've tied a lot of these rogue-like games with perma-death recently and this one definitely stands out a a diamond in the rough.","April 27, 2015","true","5.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's like playing a classic roguelike, the only difference being it's realtime and combat factors in your skill. Combat plays very similarly to Skyrim, and once you understand how to move and chain your attacks I think it's a very solid system.\n\nIn terms of loot and magic, it's good. Once you get past the first three floors you will start finding more interesting pieces of equipment.\n\nGraphics are simple but they have a lot of work behind them. Art and lighting are very nice. Sound effects are good enough for the job.\n\nThe music is better in some places than in others, but I'd say it's pretty good (especially the more atmospheric pieces down below).\n\nThe game as it is is a great bargain. It's a 100% finished game as it stands. And it's good. And it's still being updated.","November 9, 2014","true","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However, I know it is still only in early access but I think there needs to be a few things added, such as a slightly larger array of weapons, Toning down the OP-ness of Enemy Magic attacks (Seriously, it will kill you almost instantly with about three hits, when melee attacks to you would usually take only about 10 hits or more) A little bit more variety of elevators and/or secrets such as Buttons to uncover a secret passage, keys to open doors, Maybe add in chests for items, SUPER (That's right, different from the normal!) Secrets, a slightly more diverse Enemy Encounters, Like, more enemies, then again, there is a good selection of enemies already but eh. I don't think maybe adding in the ability to Jump in the game would be a good idea, leave that out, it's a dungeon crawler, no one can jump while crawling. (lol)\n\nWhat this game is strongest in however is the difficulty, already mentioned how OP enemy magic attacks are, and that needs to be toned down ever so slightly. The sense of exploration is there and is great, the Music (Or ambient noises I guess) REALLY Immerse the player into the game, seriously, sometimes I even get shivers being creeped out, it gives you a sense of danger and fear, Afraid to turn a corner, there have been times I have been jump scared in this game because of the noises almost sounding like they bounce off the walls of the rooms. The inventory system is pretty good, you open the Inventory and the game does not pause, I like that, it gives the player a sense of panic, ESPECIALLY When you are trying to get out a potion of healing (You hope as the potions are randomized each time you play) which means you setting up your inventory bar is CRUCIAL in this game. A thing I would like to see but I kind of have gotten used to, is the ability to use the Mouse Wheel, as haing to use the 1-6 keys on my keyboard have more than once caused me to use a potion when I wanted to use my magic wand.\nThis game is FREAKING AWESOME, if you were ever in the times of floppy disks, and played those old dungeon crawlers, and love rouge-likes, and having to fear for your life because there is perma-death in the game, this game is your new best friend!\n\nI have a couple of videos so far on the game and making a Let's Play on the game!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5-wPdHgBWk\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COnzuENBzds","October 27, 2014","true","19.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Its been in production for three years and seems like it has a lot to go to make it interesting for more than a couple runthroughs. Random Dungeon Crawling Rogue-Like Game. Its missing something big and its a combination of the mechanics and lack of really any substance that wont let me enjoy it as much as I feel I could.\n\nPros: Completely random dungeon that works well. RPG Elements. Roguelike, so you never know what you're getting or if you have any chance to succeed. Money Carries over after you die.\n\nCons: Unrefined interface, no story, visuals are hard on eyes trying to focus between like the 16 bit characters and semi 3D environment, been in development for a long time. No real drive to play through more than a few times.\n\nOverall, i'm not sure what can be added to make it more interesting. The Dev is looking for feedback, but the biggest thing would be to fix the cons. Not sure you you do that with the short playtimes. Why are you there, what are you doing, what is driving you, who are these people, what is the reward, what do I do with all this broken and useless stuff you accumulate, are some good questions to start answering.\n\n-Comiccom\n\nwww.thecomic-community.com","March 22, 2015","false","4.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The music is just superb.  I've played this game on and off for a long while now and it has come a long way.  It was always challenging and a little frustrating, but with the recent update it's challenging and enjoyable.  If the devs keep updating it then it's worth buying.","March 23, 2015","true","2.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I love the music and how some enemies seem to come out of  nowhere. This game is great if you like an fps/rpg/rogue-like, minimalist game and don't easily get nausiated from erratic user-mouse movement (because that's kinda my style). It's less pixelated than Home so it doesn't mess with my vision once I look away from my screen. Although when enemies get right in front of your face they get a little distorted but I'm sure that was intended by the developers and adds a nice flavor to the gameplay. Overall, super fun. One of the best early access games I've purchased regardless of the fact that I bought it on sale.\n\nThere has been a little bit of clipping through walls (throwing items directly into a wall at about a 30 degree angle and hallways that loop around) but it's in parts that I can't tell if it was intentional or not so this is not a negative comment, more so a random add-on to my review.","March 23, 2015","true","7.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I've been playing this game since it was in the alpha stages before it was even on Steam, and every time an update is released, it introduces new and exciting features to the game.\n\nOne of the strongest features though is the balance between difficulty, length, and permadeath.  The game isn't tremendously long, but it is quite challenging.  This is fantastic because when you win it feels like an accomplishment, but if you die it isn't a crippling blow as you were probably only 3-6 floors down.  Another 20 or 30 minutes and you could potentially get there again.\n\nThis game is a hidden gem of the indie developer scene and I sincerely hope it receives the recognition it deserves.","March 24, 2015","true","6.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

While the game is randomly generated, each floor has the same basic layout, depending on which level you've made it to.

Get the orb and do your best to escape alive, because everything comes back at you threefold once you pick up the darn thing. The first-person perspective, coupled with a few small corridors and narrow walkways, really give you a mild sense of fear and excitement--you never know what's going to jump out from behind the wall (hopefully not a magic-user).\n\nThe game is pretty short. For some players, you could run through the whole thing and escape alive in only about 3 attempts. But don't let that deter you, as it is a lot of fun regardless. That being said, I would strongly suggest picking this game up when it's on sale, as there is a lot to be desired. Still, it IS Early Access...\n\nAlso, sometimes I feel like I'm being cheated. I went down there with around 80 arrows, never found a bow, found the orb instead, tried to escape, made it back up to the first floor and FINALLY found a single bow to use the arrows with.

It is always frustrating to get a good item and then die because of one of those stupid bats. The best weapon I have found is a excellent iron mace or was it a excellent steel mace? It is good that the game gets updates regularly unlike some games. It is a good game and I think you should buy it while it's cheap.","April 27, 2015","true","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Do I like it?  Yes.  Would I recommend it?  Yes and no.\nI didn't get to experience the 'rogue-like' elements of this game.  On my very first play through I beat it in under 2 hours.  That is to say - I did not die once.  So there was no loss of equipment and items.\n\nTo me it's a nice past time dungeon crawler / Rogue-like.  Get in, mix it up, and get out.\n\nI recommend it if you enjoy the dungeon crawling "crunchy pixel" atmosphere.\n\nI do not recommend it if you are a hard core rogue-like fan - this game will not challenge you, at all.\n\nI won't draw up a pro/con list, but I will point out a few quick notes:\n\nIt's too dark, you can't see far ahead of you even with a decent light source.  Makes you feel boxed in.  And it does nothing at all to add to the element of surprise from the creatures attacking you.  Ultimately I ditched the light source the moment I could and picked up a shield.\n\nIt's too predictable.  Seen 'em once?  Yeah, the next dozen offer no variation.\n\nIt's easy to get into and play, and definitely easy to understand what's what.\nFast game pace if you just want to crawl around kill some baddies, and then head home for all the glory.\n\nUltimately I recommend it to the casual rogue-like fans that don't want to be overwhelmed, but still want to enjoy a\nquicky dungeon crawl.","April 5, 2015","true","1.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
