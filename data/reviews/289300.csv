If you like RTS, third-person shooter, strategy, and a challenge, this is for you. The levels are very nice and the mechanics compliment the time setting. It also has some pleasant blends including with Role Playing genre.\nHowever, the game does have its issues. For example, the objectives are obscure and I often find myself a few steps behind my computerized teammates. It still requires some work, because small issues, such as the ridiculously low health of armored heavy machine guns, or the surreptitious change in objective. Overall, I'd still recommend this game to anyone wanting a challenge or something different altogether.","April 16, 2014","true","12.6"," 58 of 66 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","58","66","0","0"

I play it since 2007 but not that 1.04.1 sh@t version the original 1.01. and i probably have at least 500 hours gameplay(it maybe 1000+ idk :D)!! Really good strategy game what u can be use like a 3rd person shooter, a lot of weapons, looting system, lot of vehicle types and it allow you to get as much vehicle as you want in the game, awesome game controlling,good graphics,nice physics,no big bugs(i dont even remember if i find bugs in it) .Back in the days it had a great community, lot of people from lot of country it was really really enjoyable!.\nI really miss those days :'(\nBack in those days i would say to you "BUY IT ASAP MOTHA♥♥♥♥AAAA!!!!!!"\nBut NOW...its different !!\nFirst of all, gamespy stop support FoW servers, so the game not even let you go in the multiplayer section.You just can use it in Lan with hamachi or tunngle or etc  After the MoW series , the FoW community became small, but you always find servers on it and you always enjoy when you play with it!\nNot just me and my friends think that FoW is way better than ANY! MoW game but a lot of old gamer who i talk with. Its maybe just because we grow up play with FoW, i dont really know but i dont even care at all.\nIf i can go back to those days to play again FoW in multi,  i would do it.

This isn't the first installation in their highly successful franchise, and for those players which are interested to see from where it all began, i suggest you purchase  Soldiers: Heroes of World War II\n\nIn this review, i will try to keep the whole overview of the game as short and simple as possible, so you yourself decide, whether this title is for your future enjoyment or not.\n\nThe first thing to actually keep in mind while looking at Faces of War is the fact that the game is rather old, and what used to be it's forte back in the day, to say the least, is now outdated - the graphics. Today, with games such as Company of Heroes 2 available on the market, this RTS looks a bit flat, but it is still nonetheless unique in many ways. One of it's bright and unmatched sides is the direct control over nearly any unit availible on the battlefield, ranging from your vulnerable yet versatile infantrymen to a mighty King Tiger tank. Direct Control, by the way, is especially thrilling when used while commanding a tank or some other land vehicle. This slightly changes the game from an RTS to a shoot'em'up action (might sound like a joke, but it's not). The in-game physics, even to this day, are awesome. Tanks explode, with turrets and armor bits flying everywhere. Structures, along with landscape, are completely destructable. This was also the case with Men of War's predecessor, which i have wrote earlier in this review. The atmosphere of the game is highly detailed and authenthic, regarless of the oudated graphics. The audio in the game is of very good quality, including both the original soundtrack and the sound files themselves. Machine guns rattle, explosions dominate the battlefield, soldiers scream in the heat of the battle, and all of this is accompanied by a decent amount of good generic soundtracks.\n\nThe game has three campaigns, German, Allied and Soviet one, which are all split up into three mini-campaigns. Battles range from small firefights and even covert, commando operations to massive battles (an especially good example of a mission with a massive battle is  the last German mission which involves a huge armoured full scale assault on an allied occupied town )\n\nAnother part of the game which made FoW unique is it's multiplayer. Unfortunately, since Gamespy has been shut down, playing this game on-line is now next to impossible... And as far as i have heard, even before GS ceased to provide it's services, practically nobody played this game on-line lately, prefering rather to play Assault Squad 2\n\nI recommend this game for it's sheer quality. Out of the downsides, i can outline only the oudated graphics, the lack of multiplayer(if your really want to play, you can hook up with some other guys and play a local game on Hamachi) and perhaps  my own subjective feeling of the game not possesing that *hollywood* image to it which is very often found in games these days. FoW is a good game which you play instead watching, and will bring you both a good challange and a fun time.","August 3, 2014","true","41.1"," 36 of 37 people (97%) found this review helpful","97","36","37","0","0"

The sequel, which improved and corrected a lot, and taken into account previous pluses and minuses. All the same, the first part of the series was the beginner’s exercise for the Best Way company. Yes, it was a breakthrough, the game set the tone. Faces of War  continuing success and proves that it was not accidental.\nFor those, who have not played in "Soldiers: Heroes WWII",  I’ll say, that is a symbiosis of tactical RTS, wargame, third-person shooter and RPG. Although it is not certain that this definition accommodates the entire game. It has a lot of things more. You can steal a car, as in GTA, the only difference is that it is likely to be a tank or MLRS. There is also a reverse mode of construction. Normally, it is activated after the hijacking MLRS.\nThere are three campaigns in the game: Germany, Allied troops and the Soviet. Each campaign has 5-6 maps, but it's such maps, bro, where are you (for three hours or more) attacking, retreating, stealing boats, tanks, occupying machine gun nests (not those, which makes machinegun eggs), picking on bellies  to the confrontation line, blowing up bridges, destroying whole villages and, hell, much much more. Plus, every campaign now has a tutorial that allows you to understand the basics of combat and game rules. Tutorial corresponds to the selected side and shows you all its advantages.\nCompared to "Soldiers: Heroes WWII", you start fighting with the allied forces from whom you can, if necessary, recomplete yours depleted squad. And these guys not just walking near your squad. Oh, no. They shoot, covering, they run away from grenades and sometimes gives the impression that deal with the tusk even without player. There are such AI in the game, that sometimes you just want to relax in chair and watch.\nA strong part of "Soldiers: Heroes WWII" was graphics. But everything is relative, right? "Faces of War" shows an unprecedented level of realism! Each exploded vehicle do not leave to the world of innocently killed machines, as we often see in games. She is lying, smoking and reminding past greatness. Exploded bridge does not disappear without a trace, as might be expected, does not join his killed steel friends. Oh no, he left a disfigured skeleton of mutilated concrete pillars with pieces of armatures sticking out. I can talk very long and flowery about Faces of War’s visual part. Collapsibility of objects is almost cinematic and absolute (in the sense you can destroy everything. Just E-V-E-R-Y-T-H-I-N-G!). I remember the moment, when according to the plot i was given M4A3 Calliope, multiple launch rocket system. So, I was killed  for three times, until I calm down. Until i stopped just firing my sixty 114-mm rockets and turned the city into ruins, enjoying a wasteland created. And made a separate save to come back and perform this procedure a couple of times. And feel as the evil god of war, leaving only ashes and ruins.\n“Faces of war” is unprecedentedly realistic. And not only in graphics. Your every man in game is a full combat unit, which does not want to die, and differs from other units. Snipers, infantry and heavily armed commandos have different behaviors. The tank can not be driven and simultaneously shoot from all the guns, immersing into it just one soldier. Typically for such amusements we need about four, each of which has its own role.\nListen friend, if you like the games about war, shooters, strategy, RPG, tactics, tactical strategy, just the games, to destroy, to blow up, to ride on a tank, to throw grenades and run away from grenades, hiding in the trenches, loot corpses, to shoot attacking, shoot retreating, shoot sitting, lying and on the run - play!

Allies, German and Russian. So i guess there are 40+ more hours to go and i will want to play them all.\n\nThis game is a perfect fix for my Silent Storm -type of game craving - without the bugs and crashes.  It's not turn based but since you can issue orders and pause the game at will then it does the trick. And i just dont ever get tired of the awesome vehicles - and toys that can be used to wreck the aforementioned. Nothing beats the feeling when a well positioned Tiger tank is souring everyones day and generally being an ♥♥♥ and then a 'volunteer' soldier takes a mad dash that would make Forest Gump proud to reach a defilade and toss that AT grenade on the back grill.\n\nTruly awesome example of a game in it's genre. Cons? not much - perhaps the fact that you are constantly scavenging the enviroment and bodies of ammo and precious grenades/AT-grenades/Bazooka ammo is a con as it can sometimes be a bit too much (Allies 'Omaha Beach mission' i am looking at you - who assaults a beach while carrying 0-1 grenades and just a few clips of ammo?).\n\nHandling artillery and mortars can sometimes be a pain. I also dont quite get it when a vehicle or turret is so damaged that you can't really use it. But that is offset pretty well by how awesome it is to man a AT-gun or a FLAK gun and start tearing up the place. 88mm guns are very scary to go against.\n\nGame difficulty is just right. Keep on outflanking when possible and going from cover to cover and you will get through missions well. Run around like rambo and you go down quickly.","March 11, 2015","true","40.8"," 23 of 25 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","23","25","0","0"

If you enjoy WW2 real time strategies or other war RTS games, you will like this one.  There are three campaigns and each one has about 8 missions.  The missions are challenging, fun, and can often take a few hours to complete.  It took me over 40 hours to complete the game.  It could probably be beaten quicker.  However, I like to take my time.  I also got killed quite a few times and had to reload.  Of course I saved often throughout missions.\nOne of the other things I liked was that although the game was challenging, it wasn't so hard that I would get stuck on missions.  There were a few missions that seemed impossible but I somehow got through them.  The game pace is good.\nIf you are new to these games, play through the tutorials at least twice.  There are some things such as calling an ally.  I got about halfway through and forgot how to do that.  Calling an ally is helpful and I wish I would have done it sooner.  Also, some vehicles might not move, even though they are not damaged.  Check the gas.  The tutorial explains how to fill up a tank or other vehicle.  Trust me, having vehicles, especially armored ones, makes life much easier.\nThe bottom line for me is that if you like RTS games, get this one.  I picked it up in a bundle with Men of War and had never heard of it prior to playing.  I'm glad I did.  Honestly, I would gladly pay the $4.99 for this game.","June 2, 2015","true","43.6"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","12","13","0","0"

I thought the gameplay was just like the Men of War games, and I enjoyed it, being a bit challenging at times, like most Men of War games are. The controls, however, are a bit different than the traditional Men of War type, where now you must click different tabs for different unit commands, instead of having just one tab for all, which is a bit meticulous. This is my only complaint. I would recommend to anyone looking for a good RTS that has a few challenges.

Finally after 3 long years, I complete it. Finally start first mission, kinda pumped. Entire team dies, only one left. Go Rambo. Kill like 50 Krauts with 1 anti tank grenade because the frag grenades are kinda pointless. Win mission by blowing up 3 vehicles and sniping little Nazi b!tches like it actually is 1945.

Gameplay is awesome missions are set up at impossible odds forcing you to adapt and use tactics you wouldnt think of in any other RTS, you have to use enemies weapons to beat almost every mission and with only 4-6 of your own troops given; it is astonishingly hard. Pros to this game are all of the gameplay mechanics! Sound is great, units are balanced, Towns and cities are pretty well done. Cons: AI somtimes makes stupid decisions and run blindly at enemies and get slaughtered, you can technically counter this by putting them in return fire mode but it is a real hassal.

Other times.... i spent 3 hours crawling around a trainstation, picking off constantly respawning enemies, only to die because for some reason, AI snipers can shoot further than you can.\n\nWould i recommend this game? only if you want to know what spending any amount of money on something clearly not worth it is.","November 5, 2014","false","12.5"," 7 of 60 people (12%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","12","7","60","2","7"

The game is unique in that instead of finding yourself in control of a large mass of troops and armor as you would in games like Company of Heroes you usually end up with one or two squads of infantry ranging from 4-8  troops at the beginning of missions. This focus on a smaller scale makes realistic additions such as scavanging enemy corpses for ammo or searching boxes feel okay and not too heavy of a burden. Each soldier has his own inventory, allowing him to store ammo, repair kits, or even other weapons if necessary. Additions like these help to increase immersion into the game and keep you on your toes, having to think more than about what to kill next.\n\nThe physics engine of this game is neat, if you miss and hit the ground with a tank or artillery piece a crater will appear, and you can tear down most buildings and scenery by shooting and/or driving over it (I especially enjoy driving over sandbags and seeing each individual one fall and get out of place.) Helmets fly off the heads of soldiers as bullets wizz by, and everything has a sort of heafty feel of realism. The graphics aren't too shabby either for being almost nine years old now, similar to or better than Company of Heroes in most aspects.\n\nWhen it comes to the bad there are a few gripes, but not major compliants. There are times when you run out of ammo (or even fuel if in a vehicle) and you are left thinking there might be a bug for a while because you aren't shooting/moving without any indicator large indicator. The AI can be dumb at times, for instance if your troops are out of ammo they will stand around and let the enemy shoot them without taking new cover or running around to find new ammo. At some points you end up being left with large numbers of troops/vehicles and you may feel overwhelmed as the game is more suited to controlling small groups. The voice acting is subpar for the Germans/Russians as in both cases they usually speak with crisp American accents (I suppose this is more acceptable than a poorly done accent, but it feels out of place none the less.) Finally, each of the three campaigns include the same tutorial, which is unskipable even if you have completed it before.\n\nIn the end you should buy this game if you like either strategy or the WWII setting, it's simply fun.","July 19, 2015","true","6.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The only thing I dislike about this game is fog of war, where you can’t see anything unless one of your units is in the area.  Over all, FOW is like MOW with German, America/British, and Russian campaigns that takes you through different story boards. Just make sure you try to hit the tanks on the side to kill them.","July 21, 2015","true","24.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A total of 24 missions.\nYou control soldiers with a limited inventory, the soldiers can take items and weapons from the dead or boxes in the field and can ride vehicles. You can take direct control of soldiers and vehicles and convert this in some kind of TPS. This will be particularly fun in the case of tanks and snipers.\n\nThe number of soldiers for your mission is limited so don't count with limitless reinforcements as in other games.\n\nAn excellent game at a very low price, buy it if you like MoW.\nI strongly reccomend you to play Men of War 1 before this, you can find Faces of War too frustrating if you dont have previous experience en MoW.","November 4, 2014","true","85.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
