I’m talking about games that kept the same spirit as Wolfenstein 3D, like the Doom series, Duke Nukem 3D, Half-Life, the Quake series, and Unreal. If you lived through this time, you know what I’m talking about. These games are representative of a peak in shooters in that their challenge, length, and fun depended on gameplay alone—no cutscenes that pad the game time, no predictable plot elements, and no exploitative glitches that most new school gamers use in games today. Controls were fluid and customizable, combat was fast and furious, and the games were almost exclusively for PC. It took skill to play and if you were killed, you had only yourself to blame. This was when multiplayer was on the rise, before mods and cheating took hold to as great an extent as it does now, and before cheap tactics like quick-scoping were often the deciding factor in encounters.\n\nAliens vs. Predator Classic 2000, as it’s currently known, in some ways represents one of the last examples of this FPS golden age. It was released in 1999 in the wake of the game-changing Quake (1996) and Half-Life (1998). Its main selling point, of course, is that you can play as each of the three different species, the Marine, Predator, and Alien. There are three different campaigns for each, and beating each on successively harder difficulties unlocks up to five bonus levels for each, which also bestow additional equipment to the predator and marine. Additionally, if you complete certain challenges, you can also unlock new options that may classify as “cheats” in single player. You won’t really see much of a storyline progression between levels because there isn’t really a story. As with most developers of old school shooters, Rebellion focused on gameplay more than anything and the result is excellent.\n\nBeing a game now available on Steam, you’re probably thinking about multiplayer, and yes, that is one of the best reasons for this game’s existence. In fact, it seems almost designed as a tournament fighter, given the vast differences between species. If you were to never play the story missions at all, you would still have endless amounts of fun. Of course, I’m referring more to this game in its prime (early 2000’s) rather than now, because as you might expect, not many people still play this game. But when you find a game, you will see that the multiplayer is still very good and holds up today, even if it’s under-populated.\n\nThe perfect word to describe this game is balanced. Each species has its own advantages and disadvantages such that you never really feel like one is significantly over- or under-powered. The alien is the fastest, can jump the farthest, and walk on walls, but it’s the weakest physically and only has close-range weapons. The marine is slow and relatively weak, but can resupply through medpacks and armor and has access to the motion tracker and the game’s strongest weapons. The predator is the physically toughest, has strong weapons and cloaking device, but is kind of clunky with its limited energy, limited speargun ammo, and species-specific vision modes.\n\nNow for the gameplay. This game is fast, incredibly fast. Like other old-school shooters, you have to react quickly and precisely or you’ll end up dead. Start spamming your weapons and you’ll just leave yourself open to attack and die. This game can feel relentless but never unfair. As stated above, it’s the product of a more refined and merciless age, before button-mashing, quick-scoping, and button-combinations became as prevalent as they are now. Like the alien itself, this game goes back to the roots of what makes a great shooter by stripping away all the hand-holding.\n\nNeed I say more? If you’re a product of the nineties, then you were probably into either the Aliens or Predator series at one point or another. Even if you’re not, this is a great game solely for the gameplay value. And for $4.99 you can’t really go wrong. In my opinion it’s the best AvP game ever released (better than AVP2 and 2010). And honestly, I don’t have any gripes or complaints about it, which is pretty rare for me.\n\nFor those of you interested in the more technical aspects, the Steam version is the 2000 update by Rebellion that allows for saving (yes, the original did not allow saves) and has two new weapons, the Skeeter missile launcher and the dual-wielding pistols, both for the marine. You can get graphical updates through what’s called the Redux mod, which you can get at moddb.com. You can also pick up extra multiplayer maps and other refinements for this game there as well. Happy hunting.","December 30, 2013","true","385.6"," 152 of 158 people (96%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","96","152","158","0","14"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MandatoryAlcatraz/recommended/3730/","MandatoryAlcatraz","MandatoryAlcatraz","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MandatoryAlcatraz/","254 products in account","Aliens versus Predator Classic 2000 is an example of how to do First-Person-Shooters right. The fast gameplay requires more skill and focus than most modern First-Person-Shooters. Instead of trying to level up your character to get OP weapons, most weapons have a legitimate purpose, and most of them don't feel too overpowered (except Disc, Pred Pistol, Skeeter, and Sadar. Not to forget Mines). Instead of grinding to get perks to power yourself up, Aliens versus Predator requires skill from the start.\n\nAliens versus Predator Classic 2000 allows the player to take control of three species, Aliens, Predators, or the human Marines. Each have their advantages and disadvantages.\n\nThe Alien is a melee only species, a hurtful disadvantage, but is patched up by the speed and wallcrawling ability that the Aliens have. Aliens also can smell the scents of other beings, allowing it to see its victims in the dark. The Alien regains health by headbiting Predators and Humans, you can do this on both the living and the dead. Obviously headbiting live beings is harder than dead ones, but gains back more health.\n\nThe Predator is a mix of Melee and ranged weapons. The majority of his weapons, Medicomp, and cloak are powered by 'Field Charge'. This will slowly recharge if you are not using anything that uses charge, or you can find field-charge items around the map which will automatically give you full energy. The only weapons that don't use energy are the Wristblades, and Disc (Unless you use the recall ability, this will use a small amount of energy), as well as the Speargun. But this uses ammo, which only replenishes upon death. The Predator can heal using his Medicomp, this will use a large amount of energy, but puts you back to full health everytime (TIP: The Medicomp's secondary fire can extinguish you if you're on fire). In some of the bonus levels the Predator gains a new gadget, the grappling hook, which can pull him to higher heights. The Predator also has three vision modes, which can help him spot enemies. The first vision mode can help spot humans, the second aliens, and the third other Predators and field-charges (Of course you also have the default normal vision).\n\nThe Marine is a ranged only species. The marine uses weapons like the pulse rifle, smartgun, minigun, etc. The Marine replenishes health with medkits, found about through-out levels. The marine can use armor, which can protect against Alien acid and absorbs small amounts of damage. In some of the bonus levels the Marines get a jetpack! In multiplayer Marines can select a specialist sub-class, this will allow them to pick from any of the weapons in the game (unless game host restricted it), and you will always spawn with the selected weapon, but you can only use that weapon (and the pistol).\n\nEach species can unlock bonus missions after you complete the main game, (you will unlock more if you beat it on a higher difficulty) these levels are the levels from other species singleplayer, for example: You can unlock a backwards version of the Predator's first level as Marine if you beat the Marine SP on Director's cut [Hard].\n\nNot to forget, you can unlock cheat options in the game by completing certain objectives through-out the levels. These can be things like slow-mo whenever you are near enemies. Or unlimited speargun ammo and more spears per shot as Predator.\n\nThe Multiplayer is where this game shines most. Fast gameplay and the different play-styles of each species make for very fun and memorable experience. This is one of the fastest games ever, you will die, fast, and a lot. It is extremely well balanced, and I almost never feel like a player is winning because of the species they are playing as. But, unfortunately, this game has a small player base, so at times you may not be able to find a game. Because of this the community doesn't play competitively [most of the time], anymore. Servers will also usually have a small amount of players. 8-player games are kinda rare, but when they happen, it's a lot of fun!\n\nAliens versus Predator Classic 2000 is easily one of the best games ever made.\n\n"I admire its purity."\n\n-MandatoryAlcatraz","October 28, 2014","true","419.9"," 120 of 125 people (96%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","96","120","125","6","1"

AvP combines three unique playstyles in three full length campaigns.\nThe missions will take you to different locations in the AvP universe, some of them taken from the films, some brand new. The general pacing and atmosphere is somewhat unique as enemy attacks and appearances are for the large part unscripted, and can change between playthroughs, which causes a sense of suspense as each play is a bit different. The level design is solid, item pickups are strategically placed so careful resoruce management is vital for survival. The combat is usually resolved at a break-neck speed, this combined with the dark design of the levels and a meager health supply can cause panic and a genuine sense of fear.\n\nMultiplayer is crazy fun, albeit somewhat unbalanced. While the campaigns are tailored to each race specifically the multiplayer just sort of mashes the three races together giving them some balance problems. Some weapons are too effective and essentially overpowered while some are useless completely. Fortunately weapons can be removed during the game setup eliminating some issues. Despite these objections, multiplayer is excellent in some aspects like, for example, some maps featuring destructible lighting as a tactical aid, wave style co-op mode and some interesting alternative play styles.\n\nThe marine campaign and gameplay should be familiar to all FPS players, marines are the weakest and slowest of the trio but they make up for it with bristling firepower. Marine campaign is the most atmospheric and genuinely frightening of the three, walking around dark instalations, fending off waves of drones and facehuggers evading predators and generally surviving by the skin of your teeth.\nPredator campaign puts you in the shoes of a cold blooded space hunter, using a combination of melee weapons and high tech gadgets and devices to hunt your prey. Predators are the most beefy of the three able to shrug off alien claws and marine gunfire alike, however stealth and careful planning are paramount to a successful hunt. Predator campaign revolves around the hunt, from humans to exotic forms of the xenomorph.\nThe alien is a terrifying killing machine. It can climb walls, cover 30 meters in a single pounce, smell its prey and destroy it with a combination of razor sharp claws, barbed tail or a powerful inner jaw.

This game isnt the best thing youll ever buy, but even by todays standards this is a really fun and good game, much better then aliens: colonial  Marines (total let down btw, never buy that game unless you have a lot of extra cash or are rich :/) Sure this game has its ups and downs, and it has ♥♥♥♥♥♥ graphics by the standards of today, but its still a kickass game which can be really fun if you join a MP(multyplayer) match. This game dosnt really have the best story line of all time either, as there is one person talking the whole game for all the missions (or two/three, i didnt pay attention to see if the dude on the monitors change ever, though i think its possible theres a diffrent guy on the monitor for the alien campain...). One thing this game does really well is set up atmisphere, especially for the marines who will offten be ♥♥♥♥♥♥ there pants on the campain (and sometimes even multyplayer) though rebellion seems to be able to do this in most its games anyway.

Once the single player is completed, each species can unlock five bonus missions that enrich the single player experience by allowing that species to play on a level associated with one of the other two.\n\nOn top of that, most of the single player missions (and bonus levels) have "side missions" that unlock single player cheat modes upon completion. These cheat modes allow you to alter your single player experience in various ways, such as setting your enemies on fire, turning the level upside down exc'.\n\nThe cheat modes and bonus missions add a great deal of replayability to the game.\n\nMultiplayer wise, the game has a bunch of fun gaming options varying from the good old Deathmatch and Species Deathmatch to a Coop mode and even unique game types such as tag games and Last Man Standing.\n\nThe multiplayer community for this game is still alive, but remains small and casual, which is a huge achievement in my opinion considering this game is 14 years old and managed to change 3 client softwares in that time.\n\nMost of the veteran players in this game know one another, and are generally open to newcomers, so the best way to get a game going is to join a community group and get to know some of the regulars.\n\nDue to the small amount of players, the scene is no longer competitive. However, the game does provide a high skill ceiling for those who seek a good challenge.\n\nSome of the weapons in this game are frowned upon by the community, such as the Predator Disc and Pistol, as well as the Marine Grenade Launcher and Skeeter Launcher, but they are also easy to disable when hosting games.\n\nTo sum up, this game is definitely worth your 5$ (or less, if it is on sale), even if you are not an Alien/Predator fan. You will get your money's worth and more on the single player content alone.","December 21, 2010","true","239.5"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","13","14","0","0"

I'll make no bones about it, it hasn't aged well.  At all.  I mean it really feels like it's from 2000.  I played it when it first came out back in the day and loved it then.  I still love it now.  The campaign is where the aging is most noticable.  Instead of clear objectives given to you by actual NPCs and an over-arching story line, this is very much a series of "levels" where you have to "get to the finish", and objectives are, at best, given to you via some bloke on a wall-monitor (more typically just some text at the top of the screen).  For £3.00 though, multiplayer is where this game really shines.  Many different game modes provide lots of variation and the three-class system has been thoroughly explored.  While more hectic than AVP2, with a pace reminiscent of the original Unreal Tournament, there are moments of unbelievable atmoshpere which just come out of the woodwork.  For example ending up back to back with another marine at the bottom of a cave, neither of you speaks the other's language, yet you both play the most cooperative tactics you can dig out, because if you don't, you're ♥♥♥♥ing dead.  Or stalking another player as the alien, spotting them from across the map and closing in using cover, waiting 'til they're distracted by someone else and then "boom!" headbite.  It's a lot of fun and if you don't believe me, the price is low enough to not break the bank in finding out for yourself.","February 8, 2014","true","14.5"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","14","16","0","4"

I was a fan of the Alien and Predator movies so this really liked the idea of an Alien vs. Predator game. The game itself is composed out of 3 campaigns for each species - humans, predators and aliens. Personally I would choose the colonial marines campaign as the best one. It is the longest one out of the three. Also it has that claustrophobic tensions and fear of what is going to happen when your motion sensor picks up something hurdling itself towards you while you look around looking for the spot where it will burst out of.  So while being the closest to the traditional FPS style it still is unique. The other 2 campaigns are excellent as well and play out totally differently. Predators have their gadgets and claw weapons. Aliens can walk on walls and claw/bite their way through everyone. Noteworthy for the alien campaign is that you get to go through the whole cycle - you start as an egg, hatch as a facehugger and continue until you are a full-grown alien. To this day I dare say there is not an Alien and/or Predator game better than this one (when it comes to single-player). The multiplayer was cool as well although nowadays not many people play it and the newer Alien/Predator titles have better MP in general. Overall a fantastic game worth recommending to anyone who like the genre or movies or just simply horror games.","December 28, 2014","true","0.1"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","100","9","9","5","0"

I personally enjoy the Marine missions the most, due to the terrifying atmosphere and fast, tight, and frantic First-Person-Shooter gameplay. This game doesn't rely on simple  jumpscares to be a scary game... it has real atmosphere. The Aliens are so smart and every time I hear one of their famous screeches... (nearby or far from me) I frantically spin around and search all over. (And believe me... when you turn around and unsuspectingly find an Alien behind you... it's a real treat. You'll fire your pulse rifle with such intensity... This game just really draws you in. If you (Like I was at first) are nervous about the game being too scary, just know that it still is a brilliant blend between an Action Packed First-Person-Shooter that even a real scaredy-cat like me can  enjoy this game thoroughly.\n\nThe other campaigns are... you guessed it, GREAT.\n\nThe Alien missions are all centered on some stealth and puzzle solving, and you will move at near BLINDING speeds, taking out anything that stands between you and the end of the level. I love being able to attack in a variety of ways, including lashing out your tail or slashing at your enemies with a swift scratch from your claws. The multiplayer with Aliens only is incredible. It gets really competitive as you dash toward your enemies... instincts set to kill. It feels awesome to overpower every marine (Or Predator for that matter) with the Xenomorph class.\n\nThe third campaign, focused on the Predator is very focused on stealth (Turning invisible, sneaking up behind enemies, etc.) You have many ways to attack your enemies. This campaign is pretty great, you will feel very overpowered as you hack through your enemies. There are many fun to use gadgets to take out your enemies, and you can zoom in and snipe or just go all out close combat with your opponents. This class is really awesome to play with during multiplayer, always silent but deadly as the Predator class.\n\nThis game really nails it's atmosphere, despite the somewhat dated graphics (Hey, it's from 1999-2000!) The sound is excellent and the dramatic music comes at just the right time to keep the game tense. This game was great for it's time... and still remains a classic that any fan of Aliens (Or any newcomers to the franchise) MUST pick up. At a very affordable price point of $4.99 this game offers so much, including Campaigns, Multiplayer, Survival Mode, and hours and hours of pure ALIEN FUN! I enthusiastically recommend this game.\n\nNow...

To compare the two mentioned briefly, even though "AvP 2" has better plot and employs some innovative solutions, "AvP Classic" has the speed, dynamism and style I was missing while delving into the sequel. Despite being seemingly raw or minimalistic for nowadays standards [2016], The Classic has that "something" that makes it quite a unique and fairly addictive game.\n\nTo me, Aliens versus Predator is a revolutionary title. I am far from being a computer games historian or even an experienced gamer, yet this one - I guess - brough to First Person Shooter genre what Starcraft brough to Real Time Strategy. Before Starcraft, most strategy games used to employ symmetrical armies that differed only in peripheral details. Starcraft proved that harmony could be maintained in spite of apparent void of clear balance. The same with Aliens versus Predator. The three available races: the humans, the aliens, the predators - provide distinct experience of gameplay and fantastically different world-views.\n\nTo mention the multiplayer aspect of the game: depending on the skill of a player and understanding of merits and flaws of the chosen side, the species seem to be able to cope in combat with each other - and even if there are some slight disproportions of chances in straight face to face encounter, the wide range of rules customization comes in handy to align this at the host level: beginning from allowed/disallowed section, up to the number of points granted for defeating certain specimen. The exoticism of predators and aliens make them perfect for dedicated king-of-the-hill type of match, yet we also may set a typical deathmatch or war of the races teamplay. The computer-driven aliens versus cooperative marines/predators is choosable as well.\n\nThe graphics in Aliens versus Predator Classic may look far from movie-like quality, but if a gamer is able to get over it, the game is available at pretty reasonable price, and the system requirements of it are easily achievable for modern machines.\n\nTo me, the title is a legend. One thing only bothers me subtly: why was it named "Classic 2000" instead of just "Classic"? How many Classics are there, really?","March 29","true","136.4"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","8"

And if you overlook the old grafic then you have a old gem right here :) but if you hate old grafic, then you will hate this game even though I would say it isn't that bad considered how old it is and the grafic isn't hurting your eyes which some old games tend to do XD\n\nAnd before reading more of this review, I haven't played the campaign all the way through so there might be some bits which I can't cover for you :)\n\nAliens versus predator classic 2000 is a game which takes place in the aliens versus predator franchies, the mix of the best where in the middle humans(the marines) stands between aliens and the predators.\nIn singleplayer you can choose to play one of either of these races - the alien who tries to kill and stop the invading humans - The predator who is trying to find his spaceship and hunting down the aliens and humans -  the marine who is trying to stop these species rampage on humans.\n\nLets take the cons first\n- The grafic is old, yes noone can deny that. Will it hurt your eyes? no, but for many it would without any doubt be a turnoff.\n- The singleplayer game can be unfair, sometimes it doesn't really tell you directly what to do(especially in a few maps being the alien) therefore you sometime end up being frustrating and using a lot of time, but so far only a few maps.\n- This is both a con and a pro depended on which type of player you are, when you play a map, you can't save, so if you die, you have to redo the whole map.\n- Again this can be a con and a pro, the difficulty especially on director's cut, is hard, you can really sometimes die in a instant.\n- con and pro again: The game is really fast! If you look in the comment you will see comments about this game having a fast movement. you can as a marines run as fast backwards, from side to side as forward. This can confuse a lot of people but it create a really intense multiplayergame play XD\n- The texture of the maps, the walls, the floor and so on is quite repetitive, there isn't that many details of the texture in the maps themselves.\n\nThen there are the pros :)\n- This game is really true to the franchies with still some few "artistic freedoms" like in coop multiplayer as marines, they have created some "red aliens" which are much stronger than the normal black ones. So this is really for everyone who is a big sucker for aliens vs predator franchies:)\n- Even though it is old, the game engine for me has absolutely made no trouble for me.\n- Then there is the atmosphere. Even though I have played some of the later installments, I would say that they really didn't caught the horror/dark atmosphere which this franchies are, they seemed too "bright", too light. And I must say, it gives me the creeps being marines and walking around in the dark with your little bipping radar when suddenly there is movement on the screen moving closer towards you and the intens bipping :P\n- The multiplayer playing part is very very interesting, if you can find someone to play with. I would say it is very balanced and that none of the races really is stronger than the others because of the different weapons, different strategies and choices of play.\n- I also love that especially if you are playing the alien or predator, then you do in fact have different way of solving the map. You can go rampage and kill everything(which is damn hard on director's cut mode) or you can be stealthy, choose your prey wisely, and for the predator and marine save the ammo.\n- If you play all three of the singleplayer modes you will notice that some maps have parts you have played before as being another species, which gives a good feeling that the three singleplays do really take part in the same place.\n- Also I must praise the creators development of the aliens movements, it is really fluent, sometimes so fluent that you have no ♥♥♥♥ clue if you are crawling on the ceiling, the wall or the floor XD\n- As a first person shooting game I must say that it is really good with good variaties of weapons for both marines and the predator and strategies of the alien. Yeah the unrealistic high speed movement is something speciel for this game and which might turn people off, but I would just say that it is just a matter of time to accustom :)\n- And you can play as a predator XD for me thats a big pro XD\n\n\nSo yeah the conclusing is that if you love aliens vs predator franchies and you don't mind old grafic then you have a gem right here, not perfect but a good gem anyway :) but I would still say that if you have never really being in contact with the franchies both videogames, movies and comics, then you don't need some preknowledge to play this game :)","December 14, 2015","true","2.2"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","6","7","0","5"

The game's map design seems bland at times in terms of details but the game relies so much on lighting and ambient sounds that often you don't even notice the blocky design. All three species are well represented: The Marine is a weakling facing overwhelming odds, the Predator a seasoned (but slow) veteran capable of one-hit killing Xenomorphs with his wristblades, and the Xenomorph (Alien) opens up routes beyond the reaches of humans & predators. The game's incredible speed may disorient at first but it really fits and makes the game more intense. One thing I particularly liked is how in those Marine & Predator maps where you face aliens you can never rely on being absolutely safe; waste too much time doing nothing and more aliens will spawn to come and get you. The game has its drawbacks such as its often confusing map layouts, especially in some of the Alien campaign maps, and the lack of a relevant story, but these are rather minor issues. Beaware; the game is harder on normal than the vast majority of games are on hard, and it's only made harder by the limited number of saves (four on normal) you get per level.","November 2, 2014","true","5.2"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","67","10","15","3","0"

It was a game that broke the standard FPS mold and gave us a unique and innovative experience.\n\nThe basic game is broken up into three unique campaigns, played from the different viewpoints of a Marine, a Xenomorph and a Predator. Each one with it's own unique perspective and abilities. The Marine plays much like your standard survival shooter. You walk down big empty corridors with your heart jumping out of your chest every time the motion sensor beeps. The Predator is like a beefed up marine with better weapons and the different vision modes we all remember from the movies. The alien gameplay however is where the game really shines. All of the sudden there is no up and down. No left and right. Everything is open when the maps become a myriad of ventilation shafts and shortcuts allowing you to sneak up on your unsuspecting prey. Nothing is linear when you can climb on the ceiling.\n\nA great game, even by today's standards.","November 3, 2012","true","146.8"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mothbanquet/recommended/3730/","mothbanquet","Mothbanquet","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mothbanquet/","390 products in account","Like any good horror movie, you might be tempted to look, point and subsequently laugh at Aliens versus Predator Classic 2000 whilst guffawing "get a load of those rubbish special effects, who'd be scared of that?". Well, if you do that, you are an ignorant fool. Notwithstanding this game introduced us to the first accurate representation of the Aliens genre, that being an experience that focused more on isolation, tension and near-blind encounters conducted at blinding speed, it was a step forward for games in general.\n\nHarken back to the year 2000, if you can. If you're 14 or under, this whole paragraph is probably pointless. Polygonal shooters are ugly and cartoonish, with true dynamic lighting rare. You've obviously (and rightfully) seen underage screenings of both the Aliens and Predator movies and you excitedly boot up a demo disc containing a sliver of gameplay from the much-anticipated Aliens versus Predator Classic 2000 (back then it was just called Aliens versus Predator).\n\nYou begin in a pitch-dark APC, the same one seen in the seminal 1986 movie, and instantly you feel a giddy sense of anticipation. You clutch the USCM's weapon of choice, an M41A Pulse Rifle. You scream to yourself, or aloud if feeling bold or just have no consideration for those in the next room, "I am the ULTIMATE badass!". It's dark outside the APC but you don't care. You stride out, eager to pump your enemy full of white lead (not a euphemism) and then it begins. Your motion sensor bleeps. You grin at the sound - it's just like in the movie!\n\nThen an alien shows up and you die.\n\nNow, bear in mind at this point realism in games was restricted to Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six - which your childish mind was not prepared for in 1998 and the disc was subsequently left to reside somewhere under the bed - and you can understand the terror this Aliens versus Predator Classic 2000 (Aliens versus Predator back then) demo generated. Aliens and Predators, unless played on the Training difficulty, are fast and deadly. Light is scarcer and arguably more valuable than ammo. Your armour may stop a few bullets but against razor-sharp claws and shoulder cannons? Might as well wear Kleenex, mate.\n\nThe single-player campaign features six missions in three distinct flavours. The marine, despite having access to meaty weapons and a sharp haircut, is undoubtedly the most vulnerable of the three. Your xenomorph enemies move swiftly and often you've only got a couple of seconds to react - usually to a telltale hiss, scratch or bite to the head - before you become their food. Add to this the facehuggers, whose surprise one-hit kills have induced fear-comas in the stoutest gents, and you can see the developer's statement of intent. In this game, humans are the prey.\n\nAs a Predator, you have access to deliciously effective weapons and equipment. Injured? No sweat. Just whip out your pointy healy-sticks and one agonised scream later, you're ready to go. Naturally, your human opponents are just flimsy, sweaty meatbags in the face of your cloaking-device enhanced magnificence. Properly ambushed, you can exploded them with your shoulder cannon, impale them with your spear gun or give them a good old Carl Weathers-style send off with your wrist blades. Xenomorphs prove a slightly tougher challenge but with your enhanced vision modes (which, like the Mass Effect 3 ending, come in red, green and blue flavours), superior endurance and aforementioned healy-sticks, your chances are a sight better than as a marine. Facehuggers are still cheap, insta-killing little ♥♥♥♥♥, though.\n\nThe true beauty of the game, however comes in the shape of the late H.R Giger's chillingly graceful alien killing machines. Or rather, taking control of one. My personal favourite game mode and a real change to the pace of the campaign, the Alien can dismember humans with the flick of a wrist, walk on any surface and providing it's sitting in darkness, can become near-invisible to enemies. While this is disorienting at first, there's a true pleasure in carving up everyone you come across before they can so much as react, or stalking that particularly annoying marine from the ceiling before dropping on him unawares.\n\nBeing from the year 2000 (the flashback to that year ended a few paragraphs ago), the game does look its age. Polygons are smooth but the textures are a little muddy, but the Steam version runs well on Windows 7 and at resolutions we'd never thought possible 14 years ago. There are even an additional 5 or 6 missions for each character to be unlocked after finishing the game on each difficulty. The sounds are all accurate and pertaining to their franchises, though for atmospheric purposes I'd recommend turning the music off altogether for the marine missions.\n\nThe only truly inexcusable issue relates to the truly awful in-game cinematics. While the original release had a modestly-budgeted yet competently acted cut-scenes of a marine who was black yelling at you (or about you, in the case of the ETs), at some point they re-released the game with vids of fully costumed men who are white, with possibly the worst American accents this side of Gerard Butler. Yes, they look prettier but...well, just don't exit to desktop the first time you hear 'Lissen up Prahvat".\n\nIn summary, for anyone who knew and loved this game back in the days before bloom lighting and other graphical terms I can't be bothered to Google, pick it up and see for yourself how easy and forgiving modern games are. For everyone else, just pick it up and receive a masterclass in how an Aliens game should be done, i.e. with darkness, quick deaths and loud, piercing yelps of fear and shock.","June 20, 2014","true","1.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

THIS GAME IS BEAUTIFUL. Seriously, grab this game over the other version of avp. Because I actually ENJOYED THE MULTIPLAYER WITH THIS GAME. Forget what I said about 'the mp doesn't feel strategic' because that's obviously ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.\n\nThe thing I love about this game is that it sets the tone of a survival horror type game quite well. It's not scary like amnesia but scary in the sense that you're out of ammo, low on health trying to get around the aliens in the level. The level design is colorful but still manages to be dark and creepy. There are a few different aliens in the game but when you meet the Praetorians or the Predaliens, you'll be running or fighting for your life. The Alien Queen level has probably been the most fun/scary part of the game.\n\nI haven't finished the Alien campaign but I managed to beat Marine and Predator campaigns on the hardest difficulties. The predator campaign throws you up against endless amounts of aliens while leaving you with limited power and ammo. Aliens will mostly best Predators in a melee and if you want to one shot them you need to charge your plasma bolt which takes a lot of power. Gameplay is fast, fun, and adds a small element of horror combined with an excellent level design. The only other game I've played that had this kind of level design was F.E.A.R. which wasn't too different. There are upgrades, ammo, armor, etc. and in order to get special upgrades was to search or explore the level.\n\nAs for multiplayer, I kind of ♥♥♥♥♥ about it time to time. The Marines from what I've seen are probably the best, since you can corner camp and gun down countless adversaries with your minigun. It's not fun, just watching two marines sit in a corner and kill you instantly. Not only that, when you're cloaked as a predator they can still see you (if they're veteran) and Aliens don't seem to have too many advantages, sure they have speed, but it means nothing against a guy with perfect aim. The only way I've been able to beat these marines was to use the disc (considered op) and the spear gun (I prefer the spear gun because you have one disc). There's not much element of stealth or strategy in the game, imo, just twitch shooting and melee is quite strange.\n\nIf you want to pick up a well designed game with a somewhat decent multiplayer, then sure! Go ahead.","July 17, 2014","true","25.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","2"

So there's that. If you're looking for a fast-paced, classic and inexpensive game to have a taste of what it was like back in 1999, this is for you.\n\nPros:\n-Many levels over three campaigns, short, straight forward but tough\n-Unadulterated challenge\n-Multiplayer can still hold up with friends, play it over GOG and/or Steam's network\n\nCons:\n-Frustrating xeno AI and movement\n-I found a game breaking bug (save related)\n-Weak if any story\n\nYou'll end up blasting through each mission but thankfully they're numerous and challenging to beat even on the Medium difficulty setting, and you might get irritatedat how the xenos apparently fly around rather than lunge towards you. Still, you can die pretty quickly as any species and so can they, so make your shots count. Thankfully, the game is somewhat generous when it comes to giving you items, with each playthrough being inherently different as spawns and numbers change each time.\n\nI've to say that even for 1999's standard, it wasn't the best looking game, so it hasn't aged particularily well, but it's not the worst either. The music is great as is expected for any game in this franchise, and multiplayer seems optimized well enough. It's actually one of the better games in the Aliens and/or Predator series simply because it's unadulterated and simple fun. The three campaigns seem to be cleverly set up from annoying, to hard to satisfying (as the predator), so I'd suggest playing it in that order.","March 30","true","14.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197996760307/recommended/3730/","76561197996760307","Dennis Stamp","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197996760307/","106 products in account","Aliens versus Predator Classic 2000 is one of my all-time favorite first person shooters. It does tremendous justice to the source material upon which it is based and is one of the finest examples of an excellent game based around movie licenses.\n\nThe alien, predator, and marne campaigns all play very differently from one another. The strengths and weaknesses peculiar to each species really make the online multiplayer experience something special, although predators and marines do move absurdly fast during deathmatches. It seems like the developer was trying to balance movement between the species, but doing this by artificially speeding up marines and predators to move as quickly as aliens just seems wrong. Movement speeds are normal in skirmish matches, which I prefer to deathmatches.\n\nAlthough AVP's online netcode is peer-to-peer based, it is easily the best impementation of P2P netcode I have ever experienced. In fact, it consistently outperforms dedicated servers for other games - even when I play AVP with players from across the world while stationed in mainland China (which has some of the worst internet anywhere).\n\nThere is still an online community for this game, and the regular players tend to be very down to earth and friendly. Unfortunately, you may encounter the odd cheater from time to time, but the Steam port allows you to set up private games with your friends. It would have been better if players were given tools to kick and ban cheaters from their games by way of vote, but considering how well native netcode was incorporated into a game this old, it's hard to complain about that (or the lack of native voicechat.)\n\nAs great as the online experience is, it's hard for me to say enough positive things about the single player campaigns. While there is a very minimal sense of plot, you do feel like you have purpose to your actions and that all the carnage the unfolds does so for good reason.\n\nThe atmosphere and tension in the game are incredible. When ambushed by aliens, you can easily die a sudden death. Aliens pose a very real threat to the player and do not strike exclusively during scripted sequences (like in the game's sequels). What that means is that you'll need to be on your toes at all times while playing this game. Its hard but fair, and that's the way I like it. AVP has treated me to some of the most startling moments I've ever experienced, and it's nice knowing that I can experience those kinds of moments again and again despite how much time I've spent enjoying the game.\n\nIf you're going to play the alien campaign, be aware that the very first stage is probably the most difficult one you'll encounter. That's because is so easy to be nearly burned to death from the moment you encounter the first human carrying a molotov cocktail, and there are many of them throughout the stage. Not only are you very likely to be slowly incinerated by their concoctions if they are thrown anywhere in your general vacinity, but also if you kill a human who happens to be carrying one.\n\nAs an alien, it's also very easy to get mowed down by stage 1's automated machine gun turrents unless you can find a way to sneak around them. A viable - but also very challenging - alternative to overcoming those obstacles is to crawl on ceilings and dart past the turrents at a 60 degree angle.\n\nIt took me many, many replays before I was finally able to develop a good sense of how to overcome stage 1's cocktail-wielding humans and automated machine gun turrents. Had I known that you can enable unlimited saves by saving a command line in the game's launch options, I could have saved myself a lot of frustrating but strangely fun chalenge while trying to beat the first alien stage.\n\nWhile doing business abroad, I was able to play AVP perfectly with full settings on a friggin' netbook. Not even the original Doom or Heretic can run on that kind of hardware without occasional slowdown when launched with Zandronum or zDoom.\n\nIn conclusion, AVP Classic 2000 is one of the very best puchases I have ever made, even though I owned the retail version of the game prior to buying the Steam port for convenient online multiplayer access. Get this game now, even if there is no discount at the time you are reading this review. The game is worth it, and then some. I tip my hat to Rebellion software for this great game.\n\nMY RATING FOR AVP CLASSIC 2000 (ACROSS VARIOUS KEY FACTORS):\n\nGraphics: 7.5 / 10. They were pretty good at the time of the game's release, and there are moments when the game's visuals still inspire awe, like the waterfall at the end of the predator's first stage.\n\nSound: 10 / 10.\n\nSingle-player content: 10 / 10.\n\nOnline experience: 9.5 / 10. The native matchmaking system that was incorporated into the 'Classic 2000' port of the game is very good, and the game's netcode is - in my experience - unparalleled. Even though the netcode is P2P-based, it consistently outperformes many dedicated servers supporting other games. The main reason why the game doesn't get a perfect score in this category is because the absence of dedicated servers means that sometimes you have to wait a while until someone joins an online game that you host for lack of being able to find an online match to connect to. Other than incorporating native voice chat and giving players a voting system for banning cheaters / jerks / etc., there isn't much more that I could ask for from the game's excellent multiplayer component.\n\nPlot: 6 / 10. This is the game's weakest link. There really isn't much of a plot to the game, but there are videos that play on monitors as you progress through the single-player modes. You can ignore the videos if you like, but Rebellion deserves credit for incorporating these clips into the game without slowing it down for those who want to focus on action. To be fair, the game intended to showcase atmosphere over plot and really did a fine job in that regard. (It's like the original Quake, albeit with scripted FMV playback that gives purpose to new challenges you experience.)\n\nGameplay: 10 / 10. Incredible! Play the game and experience the terror, the suspense, and the frantic action for yourself!\n\nOverall: 88 / 100","May 24","true","60.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

You get to play 3 campaign modes: The Alien, the predator and a colonial marine. This game is a lot more fun than Aliens: Colonial marines in my opinion. The campaign mode is quite hard and will need a lot of practice before finally completing the game!\nThere are no check points in the levels and that means if you die you have to restart all over again.\n\nApart from the campaign mode there is also a skirmish gamemode in which you can fight off hordes of aliens playing as either a Colonial marine or a predator in iconic maps such as Hadley's hope and the derelict ship!\n\nUnlike Aliens vs predator 3 there are no brightness issues with this game and when you do come across a dark corridor or room you have an unlimited amount of flares as well as night vision.\nThere are a couple of bugs such as the water spazzing out but considering this game game out in 2000 ( when i was born ) the graphics are good for the time and you wont be disappointed ( hopefully! )\n\nThere is also a multiplayer mode but unfortunately there are very few servers up and running but when there is a match with a good lot of people it is very fun and intense. In the game you can find a good variety of weapons including the iconic Pulse rifle, Smart gun and flamethrower as well as duel wield pistols and rocket launchers!\n\nBeing a big fan of the Alien and Predator franchises i enjoyed this game and rate it a 7.5 out of 10!

The three campaigns (marine, alien and predator) all have distinct playstyles and feels resulting for some interesting gameplay. The alien allows you to speed around and stealthily slice up your foes while the predator puts you in the position of a enormous tech-wielding badass, both of which are fun in their own way. Marine meanwhile plays almost like a horror game, the tense atmosphere and dark surroudings being peppered with aliens popping up out of every nook and cranny imaginable to terrifying effect. All three are highly enjoyable to run through, and may even be worth coming back to and going through again later on.","September 11, 2014","true","11.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Multiplayer Co-Op felt like a COD zombies match but with aliens jumping from the walls and falling from the sky and they crawl freakin everywhere they'll jump out of ducts of the walls just awesome have not tried the Predator yet cant wait though its a shame theres no dedicated servers though and mic support would be awesome but atlest you can type wich is fine but its a bit hard when you're surrounded and abot to die to type for help but its still a cool game its really good for only 5$ cant wait to try my 360 controller on it! EDIT:just played as predator turns out im pretty dam good at it he has lots of weapons and can turn "partially" invisble too much movement can give you away he has different types of vision my favoite is thermal because it allows certian weapons to lock on targets his spear gun is awesome it can basicley kill anyone with one head shot i mean like basicley everyone his wrist blade is "okay" you have to charge it up with the secondary fire button for an instant kill and its best to do it from behind he also has a a medic kit which he can use to heal "himself" but it drains almost all of your energy bar which is also needed for his pistol and shoulder cannon he has this throwing razor disc thing that can slice through anyone ive even got 3 kills with it with one throw it went through one marine and two aliens fighting it was pretty funny you only get one but you can look for it after you throw it and pick it back up honestley the predator is probabley my favorite but the marine weapons are awesome though so its a tie between those 2.","January 24, 2014","true","15.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This game marks the end of an age just prior to the new millenium console wars between Nintendo, Sony, and Microsoft.

Unfortunately times have changed, and more and more I find myself longing, and even romanticizing the memories of the new Title that caught my eye. Speaking of titles, AvP Classic is an excellent choice that tells you what you're getting. Aliens vs Predators (and yes, marines). But arguably most important, the game is a classic. Thanks to a re-release in 2000, and new age platforms such as Steam, we're able to relive these adventures on today's top of the line machines.

Multiplayer Co-Op felt like a COD zombies match but with aliens jumping from the walls and falling from the sky and they crawl freakin everywhere they'll jump out of ducts of the walls just awesome have not tried the Predator yet cant wait though its a shame theres no dedicated servers though and mic support would be awesome but atlest you can type wich is fine but its a bit hard when you're surrounded and abot to die to type for help but its still a cool game its really good for only 5$ cant wait to try my 360 controller on it! EDIT:just played as predator turns out im pretty dam good at it he has lots of weapons and can turn "partially" invisble too much movement can give you away he has different types of vision my favoite is thermal because it allows certian weapons to lock on targets his spear gun is awesome it can basicley kill anyone with one head shot i mean like basicley everyone his wrist blade is "okay" you have to charge it up with the secondary fire button for an instant kill and its best to do it from behind he also has a a medic kit which he can use to heal "himself" but it drains almost all of your energy bar which is also needed for his pistol and shoulder cannon he has this throwing razor disc thing that can slice through anyone ive even got 3 kills with it with one throw it went through one marine and two aliens fighting it was pretty funny you only get one but you can look for it after you throw it and pick it back up honestley the predator is probabley my favorite but the marine weapons are awesome though so its a tie between those 2.","January 24, 2014","true","15.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

We have moved on in terms of 3D rendered environments and I found the AvP 2000 world hard to interact with and become immersed in.\n\nHowever, there is still a charm to replaying this title but it won't last and you will find yourself losing interest rapidly.","April 28, 2015","false","0.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This game is 14 years old and the graphics are dated (for me i don't care for graphics at all) and the gameplay never gets tiring.  There is 3 stories not including multiplayer, theres aliens, colonial mariens, and the predator (my personal favorite).  I havn't beat any of them because there pretty chalaging.  The multiplayer is AMAZING theres a couple different gamemodes to play.  I can't list all but my favorite is alien tag.  The host starts off as and alien and the rest are either marines or predators and who ever kills the alien gets to be one and so on.  For this game being 14 years old its amazing.  Violence 10/10 graphics 8.5/10(for its age) Gameplay 10/10 controlls 9/10 game its self 10/10.  Got 5 bucks and don't now what to buy?

However when I found out it wasn't I was kinda bummed out along with the fact that the Skirmish game mode is basically survival and you can't be a Xeno, but in the ennd it's still fun running through Hadley's hope doging jumping aliens as you slowly get your guts ripped out.\n\nNow the story mode I found is ok. I personally love seeing friendly NPC's get slaughtered but so far I have not seen a single friendly other then technically on the screens. In turn this might be a good thing seeing how some of the pathfinding for some things such as the aliens is not great at times (for instance when I was playing a skrimish match at least 6 aliens where on the floor above me but only one of the managed to actually get down to me which evetually gave me a new hole which more aliens could useas a hole for golf).\n\nAll in all great original FPS game but the multiplayer option is there no one is ever on sadly so in my opinion unless you are a fan and like old FPS games I wouldn't not suggest this game.","March 19","true","2.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It's cool, that it is on stem. It is mix of games types, for example Marine campaign is a horror game, where every noticed movement is makieng you to start being scared. I didn't played campiagn much, so i'll update this review with my feelings about campaign later.\n\nMulti in this game is alive, it's easy to find servers. Sometimes there aro no servers, but when you'll create one someone will definetly join soon. Multiplayer is hard. Some new players are easy to kill by experienced ones, but sometimes new player can be a hard opponent, killing really good players. I was such a player. I was really surprised when i was invited to join a tournament and even more surprised when i won it. But that wasn't easy. This game is really fast and you need to have good reflex. Ping may disturb a bit, but you don't need some cool internet to have chances. I have ~100 ping it's not too much toplay comfortable. Somehow this game has even elements of strategy. It's good to plan your movements, but you are not alway able to do it. Every character can be hard or easy to kill, all you need is just how to play with a specific character. For example i had 1 vs 1 with a player. I played as predator and he played as alien.  Score was something aroun 1200:150 for him. So the thing in multi is: skill, training and bit of a luck. Sometimes you can kill hard opponets, and sometimes die with easy ones. In multi you have few game types. Causual deatmatch all vs all, spieces deatmatch, where players that are playing with the same spiece should cooperate to destroy others, cooperative, where marines and predators are fighting together against aliens and some more. Every one will find something for yourself. This game contains a lot of fun, espacialy when you are playing with friends.

It's cool, that it is on stem. It is mix of games types, for example Marine campaign is a horror game, where every noticed movement is makieng you to start being scared. I didn't played campiagn much, so i'll update this review with my feelings about campaign later.\n\nMulti in this game is alive, it's easy to find servers. Sometimes there aro no servers, but when you'll create one someone will definetly join soon. Multiplayer is hard. Some new players are easy to kill by experienced ones, but sometimes new player can be a hard opponent, killing really good players. I was such a player. I was really surprised when i was invited to join a tournament and even more surprised when i won it. But that wasn't easy. This game is really fast and you need to have good reflex. Ping may disturb a bit, but you don't need some cool internet to have chances. I have ~100 ping it's not too much toplay comfortable. Somehow this game has even elements of strategy. It's good to plan your movements, but you are not alway able to do it. Every character can be hard or easy to kill, all you need is just how to play with a specific character. For example i had 1 vs 1 with a player. I played as predator and he played as alien.  Score was something aroun 1200:150 for him. So the thing in multi is: skill, training and bit of a luck. Sometimes you can kill hard opponets, and sometimes die with easy ones. In multi you have few game types. Causual deatmatch all vs all, spieces deatmatch, where players that are playing with the same spiece should cooperate to destroy others, cooperative, where marines and predators are fighting together against aliens and some more. Every one will find something for yourself. This game contains a lot of fun, espacialy when you are playing with friends. I really recommend this game, it's worth to buy.","January 16, 2015","true","41.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Unless you played this game in the past, or just want to spend 5 bucks out of curiousity, I wouldn't recommend it. Older games can be very hit and miss with people, especally if its their first time playing one that they haven't played before. Im not saying this a bad game by any means, but the faster than hell ice skating gameplay combined with the late 90's type of graphics with the extremely cheesy voice acting, and the recycled enviroments kind of turned me off. It just got dull extremely fast. (Im not against older titles, i did play system shock 2 not to long ago for the first time and loved it, and the original unreal tournament has been one of my favorite games of all time since it came out. oh and half life 1 of course)  Also, Alien and Aliens are my 2 favorite movies of all time, but even that didn't help me to enjoy this. Again thats just my opinion, but if you don't mind spendin 5 bucks im sure it wont kill your bank account, I for one just didn't enjoy it, So with that all said i cant recommend a game that i personally did not enjoy.","March 1, 2015","false","0.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The game allows you to play through 3 campaigns; The Marine, Alien, and Predator, all varying with different gameplay styles. The Marine focuses on survival horror and suspense, but surprisingly works well with its fast-paced action. The Alien campaign focuses on over-powered action, climbing through vents, and a little mix of stealth. Overall, this is probably my least favorite campaign, due to how confusing wall climbing is. Lastly, we have the Predator campaign, which is amazing. With all the cool weapons at your disposal, this campaign is re-playable and has a perfect, challenging mix of stealth. Overall, Aliens versus Predator Classic 2000 is worth your money.","December 12, 2013","true","2.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The Alien and Predator campaigns are really fun, both give you the feeling of being both hunter and hunted while playing completely different. The Colonial Marine campaign is my favorite though because it is effectively scary; watch Alien and Aliens and then play this in the dark! The story, unfortunately, is mostly inferred, but it's there if you look hard enough. I definitely recommend this game if you're a fan of the Alien and Predator franchises and don't mind dated graphics; I doubly recommend the Marine campaign if you're looking for a scary game.","January 11, 2015","true","0.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I really do. I love the movies (well, the first ones anyhow), and I got this for free from selling cards, so maybe I shouldn't complain, but I feel like it was a waste even then. Lemme talk it through:\n\nThere are three characters to play. Yeah, so far that's the only cool part of this for me. There's the Alien, the Predator, and the human Soldier.\n\nThe soldier was the easiest to play. He was the only one that didn't have a bunch of weird and confusing controls and HUD. Not necessarily that he didn't have any work put into him. Actually I think it's good they left him so simple, otherwise he would be just as confusing and/or difficult to play as the others. He's just the basic soldier-y character, and was fun to play for a few minutes.\n\nThe Alien is the one you want to immediately jump to playing, naturally. What cooler character to be than an all-powerful alien crawling on ceilings and ripping apart humans. Except he can't. The crawling is hard because of his super-weird, eye-throbbing x-ray but not-x-ray vision. AND, no matter how hard I try, as soon as I'm seen by humans, they start shooting, and I have five seconds to panic, try to fight, and then die. I don't get it. He's more annoying to play than anything.\n\nThe Predator. I really, really thought I was going to enjoy being a super-strong, armored alien. But... he's really, really confusing, and hard to play. Now, there's the expected problems, because of the game being a tiny bit older. Jumping can be tricky, and turning and discriminating a black alien from a low-res brown wall can be a pain, but manageable. But then add a weird hieroglyphic power system, a slew of different weird weapons, and did I mention the power system?, all together makes for a mess of a hard-to-play extra-terrestrial.\n\nSo yeah, there's the problems with it being a bit old. But it's not that, it's the weird gameplay mechanics, poor design choices, and over-use of things that older games have obvious problems with anyways that really makes this a hard game to enjoy. I think they put more time into making it about three characters than making each character a good one. If it had JUST been the Alien to play, and they put all the effort on the one rather than three different characters, it would've been way better. I actually do kind of like it, but there's just poor choices here.\n\n6/10, 'cause I wanna like it, but still, not Recommended","December 3, 2014","false","0.6"," 4 of 25 people (16%) found this review helpful","16","4","25","0","0"

The first time I ever upgraded a computer, it was to play this game. There’s a lot of nostalgia that goes along with this game for me. There isn’t much to the game itself, a straight forward shooter for the most part. The levels tend to be somewhat bland, and undecorated (tunnel after tunnel). There are a lot of fun weapons, and abilities throughout the game, as well as “exploit” unlocks after you finish the game under certain conditions. Really, the only reason to buy this is if you played it during original release, or are a massive fan of the genre.","January 8, 2014","false","8.3"," 4 of 29 people (14%) found this review helpful","14","4","29","0","0"

It's a reenvisioned version of the first AVP game with an enhanced engine and intuitive combat. The xenomorph and predator designs are beautiful despite the aged graphics.\n\nTHE GOOD:\nThe game does a stellar job of showing off the ferocity of the iconic xenomorphs. However, they don't seem as threateningly intelligent as those in the movies. Most of the time, they simply rush at you heedlessly and are little more than average cannon fodder for those weilding a pulse rifle. Combat controls are responsive and easy to handle, and a wide range of weaponry and attacks are available to each class.\n\nTHE BAD:\nThe bad part is the story, which truly killed it. Although the level design is good, the storyline in itself is horrendous. In fact, I didn't even know what the story was for any of the campaigns. All I know is that some fat guy on the televisions was telling me where to go and what to do, which was basically kill this, kill that, get here and complete the level. Another demoralizng part is the fact that each campaign starts and ends with a beautifully detailed CGI cutscene, but then immediatey transitions into the hideous textures of the actual game. The lack of direction as to what you should do forces players to save constantly, as you will inevitably see many cheap deaths in each campaign. Not even the extra levels beyond the main campaign are very good, as they have little to no dialogue and just give you an extra gun or a jetpack to shoot more xenomorphs. As no one ever plays the multiplayer, I can't say anything for that, and every time I try to play the other game modes, it doesn't load, which is odd considering that I have a very good computer. The part that annoyed me the most, however, was the terrible musical score, which was just annoying and nonsensical.\n\nVERDICT:\nIf you're a fan of the xenomorphs or the predators, then you may enjoy this game. But if you like story, prepare for frustration, because this game has none. Graphics are hideous in comparison to other games made in this era and the enemy AI are simply stupid and kill you in cheap ways. Overall, you aren't missing anything by not playing this game.","February 15, 2014","false","18.3"," 5 of 32 people (16%) found this review helpful","16","5","32","0","2"

There are 3 campaigns starring drastically different characters. You can play as a Marine, Predator, or Alien. Each has their own playstyle  and weaponry.\n\nThe game is from 2000, so the graphics are quite dated. People, enemies and environments all look very blocky. Thankfully, the devs have increased the resolution for the rerelease, so everything appears a bit sharper than I imagine it did in the original. Still, the graphics are rough and that's something you will have to deal with if you want to enjoy this game.\n\nEach species has a unique control style, and luckily in this update gamepad support was added. That's my preferred method, although I found the aiming to be quite difficult, and probably much easier to handle with a mouse. There are some areas with generally frustrating platforming which you will have to navigate. You are also just thrown into the campaign without a tutorial, so prepare to learn the controls yourself through trial and error. Most games these days at least let you know quickly how to get around the controls, so this game shows its age in that way.\n\nThe sound and general atmosphere is pretty well done. There is voice acting, and as a marine you will get your orders from the recording of a live actor. There are some general scary moments, especially playing as a marine in the dark while Xenomorphs are hunting you.\n\nOverall, while I feel this may have been an enjoyable game in its time, that time has passed. Many of the FPS and 3D games from that era feel dated, and it really shows here. From the controls, to the graphics, to the general gameplay, the genre has improved leaps and bounds since 2000. While there's some enjoyment to be had for big time Alien fans or those that played this in the past and are feeling nostalgic, I'd recommend most people to stay away.\n\nGrade: C-","June 30, 2014","false","1.0"," 8 of 43 people (19%) found this review helpful","19","8","43","0","12"

For example, in the Marine campain you're thinking 'were am I going", the Alien is "wow, slow down. Hay, where is the exit?" and the Predator, well that is a "slow down a little, but hey, at least I know where I'm going...sort of." However, these dont ruin the game but can actually enhance it. With the Alien it was actually kinda fun to dun around at insain speeds and look for an often tiny exit in a big room, and it could be on the wall, floor or celing. Sure, its a massive pain when you run around for ages getting nowehere, but thats why we have walkthroughs. Full honsest I needed a walkthrough for this game more than any other, but hey, it doesn't take away much of the game. It's really fun to forget whether you are on the roof or the floor, and this is the only game to give me that experience.\nDespite all the laughts I've had with this game, it is actually still scary, especially for its time. I still have to turn away when I'm killed by a facehugger, and don't get me started on the music, it is tense and amazing. Sure, maybe there was a bug here or there but it was still enjoyable (and tha was likely my com♥♥♥♥r, not the game anyway). Truley a fantastic game, despite it's age.","January 6, 2015","true","9.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/polina_lis/recommended/3730/","polina_lis","Google Chrome","http://steamcommunity.com/id/polina_lis/","51 products in account","Aliens versus Predator Classic 2000 is an example of how to do First-Person-Shooters right. The fast gameplay requires more skill and focus than most modern First-Person-Shooters. Instead of trying to level up your character to get OP weapons, most weapons have a legitimate purpose, and most of them don't feel too overpowered (except Disc, Pred Pistol, Skeeter, and Sadar. Not to forget Mines). Instead of grinding to get perks to power yourself up, Aliens versus Predator requires skill from the start.\n\nAliens versus Predator Classic 2000 [Which I will be calling 'AvP' through out the rest of this review] allows the player to take control of three species, Aliens, Predators, or the human Marines. Each have their advantages and disadvantages.\n\nThe Alien is a melee only species, a hurtful disadvantage, but is patched up by the speed and wallcrawling ability that the Aliens have. Aliens also can smell the scents of other beings, allowing it to see its victims in the dark. The Alien regains health by headbiting Predators and Humans, you can do this on both the living and the dead. Obviously headbiting live beings is harder than dead ones, but gains back more health.\n\nThe Predator is a mix of Melee and ranged weapons, the majority of his weapons, Medicomp, and cloak are powered by 'Field Charge'. This will auto-recharge if you are not using anything that uses charge, or you can find field-charge items around the map which will give you full energy. The only weapons that don't use energy are the Wristblades, and Disc (Unless you use the recall ability, that will use a small amount of energy), as well as the Speargun. But this uses ammo, which only replenishes upon death. The Predator can heal using his Medicomp, this will use a large amount of energy, but puts you back to full health everytime (TIP: Secondary fire of Medicomp will put out fires). In some of the bonus levels the Predator gains a new gadget, the grappling hook, which can pull him to higher heights. The Predator also has three vision modes, which can help him spot enemies. The first vision mode can help spot humans, the second aliens, and the third other Predators and field-charges (Of course you have the default normal vision).\n\nThe Marine is a ranged only species, guns guns and more guns. The Marine replenishes health with medkits, found about through-out levels. Armor, which can protect against Alien acid and absorbs small amounts of damage. The Marine has a Motion Tracker, if anything moves, a small dot and a beep sound will appear on it. But it isn't always reliable, if ANYTHING moves it will beep. In some of the bonus levels the Marines get a jetpack, allowing them to fly to spaaaaace! In multiplayer Marines can select a specialist sub-class, this will allow them to pick from any of the weapons in the game (unless game host restricted it), and you will always spawn with the selected weapon, but you can only use that weapon (and the pistol).\n\nEach species can unlock bonus missions after you complete the main game, (you will unlock more if you beat it on a higher difficulty) these levels are the levels from other species singleplayer, for example: You can unlock a backwards version of the Predator's first level as Marine if you beat the Marine SP on Director's cut [Hard]. Pretty cool!\n\nNot to forget, you can unlock cheat options in the game by completing certain objectives through-out the levels. These can be things like slow-mo whenever you are near enemies. Or unlimited speargun ammo and more spears per shot as Predator.\n\nThe music will change depending on what species you are playing as, Predator will recall images of the jungle, Marines have a very militaristic beat, while Aliens have a slow and creepy tone. The music really sets the tone well, but I wouldn't find myself listening to it outside the game.\n\nThe Multiplayer is where this game shines most. Fast gameplay and the different play-styles of each species make for very fun and memorable experience. This is one of the fastest games ever, you will die, fast, and a lot. It is extremly well balanced, and I almost never feel like a player is winning because of the species they are playing as. But, unfortunatly, this game has a small player base, so at times you may not be able to find a game. Because of this the community doesn't play competitively (most of the time), anymore. Servers will also usually have a small amount of players, 8-player games are kinda rare, but when they happen, it is sooooo fun!\n\nAliens versus Predator Classic 2000 is easily one of the fastest games, and one of the best, ever made.\n\nYou would be doing yourself a disservice by not playing this game!\n\nWhy are you still reading this review, go buy it and play it?!","January 7, 2015","true","0.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Always need to be moving.\n\nI've played this game on the colonial marines campaign, and by god it takes me back to the days of Alien Trilogy for the PSX, very dark environments, eerie soundtrack, dead atmosphere and I have no shame in saying I slowly edge my way around corners like a scared mouse about to run out of his hole. The xenomorphs are by god the scariest and brain frying enemies I've ever faced in a game, the sheer speed and appearance (I'm aware the graphics are dated by hey ho), and the sounds they make as they lunge at you can only take me back to the Alien and Aliens film, specifically the second one when the marines get ambushed.\n\nThe game cooks up the perfect flavour, the smart gun, the pulse rifle are instantly given a place in my heart, and the little things like acid spray from aliens and elevators moving up and down that make the motion tracker plip are just downright evil and fantastic. The motion tracker is one of those things you don't want to have but you need it, the eerie plip makes your trigger finger stiff and ready to shoot, then you find that it was just an elevator going up and down, but what was making it do that?\n\nTo anyone who loved the Alien franchise, definitely give the colonial marines campaign a go, it's by far one of the scariest you'll ever play, the deathmatches are so fun, who knew the predator was so hard to kill...","January 18, 2015","true","1.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Aliens...Predators...Colonial Marines, oh my.\n\nThe Good:  Albeit an old, "Classic" game, it's got good, solid controls.  The storyline is decently thought out for the 3 types of campaigns (one for each race), although sadly, they're a bit on the short side.  Where this game shines, though, is the multiplayer.  Aliens are quick and fragile (although they can heal themselves), but are primarily melee fighters.  Predators are big, hulking brutes (that go invisible...actually more of a drawback, though) with a few big guns.  Colonial Marines...they're...well...Humans...but man do they have a LOT of guns.\n\nThe Bad:  The campaigns are short, as previously mentioned.  Graphics, if that matters to you, are...well, dated.  And the Aliens' vision...what, at the time, was called Fishbowl Vision, can be...disconcerting (120 view, versus the normal 90 view).  And finally, and sadly, although multiplayer is where the game shines, it's sorely lacking in maps...and since it's such an old game, there's little to no chance of any fan-made content for it.\n\nThe Ugly:  The user interface is...weird.  Although you can use a mouse to look around...there is no actual mouse use on the menues.  That's really it...and even then, that's more of a personal inconvenience instead of a really bad feature.\n\nOverall...I think this game rates a 4.5 out of 5.  A great game, a great multiplayer experience.","December 7, 2013","true","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Why? Because it has something to offer that not a single game that not even the sequels got right. Three distinctive characters to play as with different play styles that are done particularly well in their own aspects. Levels that are short yet sweet like a mission from Metal Slug and not feeling bloated like Skyrim where most of the content is crap.\n\nLet's start off with the marine campaign. You play as a Colonial Marine who wakes up from a bad dream and finds out Xenomorphs are loose aboard the research station on LV-426. The story is you do menial tasks to get rid of those pesky xenos. But the story isn't the attraction to this game anyway. The game mechanics are the attraction. Each level was designed with speed running and fast paced game action in mind. Your character moves very fast (all three of them do). Your weapon arsenal is powerful for the Marine and Predator. The combat is sudden because enemies are procedurally generated in different positions throughout levels and infinitely to encourage you to keep going and not bringing the game to a halt. This means you'll never find this game to be a slog in it's pacing. There's no story sequences that bring the game to halt whatsoever. The means of telling the story is completely optional for you to listen to. While playing as the marine you'll realize you can't manually reload your weapons. This actually doesn't hinder the game as one would think it would. As your weapons contain so much firepower and reload time is so quick it will be after an engagement. Not during. If it is during one you can use your agility to avoid attacks. Still keeping the pacing up. The levels themselves are open to exploration. But the drawback to them is they can be very maze like sometimes. An obvious flaw to a good game.\n\nBut the sequences themselves are so cool you'll keep wanting to play. In Episode III in the marine campaign, I found myself encountering regular Xenomorphs and face huggers. The face huggers themselves are quite the surprise. I was torching 4 Xenos that cornered me in a hall with my flamethrower. All of them popping like water balloons filled with acid as it rains all over the steel corridors. But I see I have one more enemy near me on my radar. I toss a flare and the hall lights up. And out a facehugger pounces around the corner and cling to my face! The neat thing about this was it wasn't scripted at all. Scenarios like these provide replay value beyond the speed running to play. Something that the sequels sorely missed.\n\nThe predator himself plays like a pseudo stealth action game character at speed running with powerful weapons and a focus on melee attacks too. The first levels you'll find yourself uppercutting marines with your claws while cloaked as they dim wittily walk around in dark areas filled with more than just Xenos and bunny hopping around corridors and over cliffs. Against Xenos you'll find yourself popping off their body limbs with your claws, accurately predicting their movements do you pin them against walls with your spear gun, or just blasting them away your shoulder cannon in a super cool vision mode just like the movies!\n\nThing is about killing the Xenos as either Marine or   Predator. You have to be somewhat tactical about killing them. They'll still spray acid fluids about after death. As a marine it will chew away your armor and health like you wouldn't believe. It'll kill you as fast as you can kill them when you get cornered and blast them away with your minigun. Killing Xenos with your claws as a predator has to be quick and efficient. You charge up, let them come to you, and let it loose and step away.\n\nPlaying as the Xenomorph reduces you to melee attacks and being able to climb anything. Simple as it is. It really works. The FOV is bigger so you can see well. Sticking to walls and wall jumping is easy as hit the CTRL button when landing. Holding it if you want to stay on that surface. You can move just as easy when holding it too! You are reduced to claws, biting enemy heads which does a lot of damage and gives you health, and a tail charge attack. You must use stealth and hit and run tactics to take out enemies. You'll be crawling on ceilings, leaping fifty feet, and delivering a timed tail attack to stab right through some jarhead's skull. It's the weakest of the three. But still manages to be good fun.\n\nDespite all this. This game has a serious flaw that needs to be brought up. The level design is highly unintuitive. It will be very maze like for first time players and very hard to spot important mission progressions in the dark environments. Some parts of the levels are copy pasted too much. You'll see the same room and halls like five times. But thankfully the linearity keeps from being like Doom 2's crap levels yet still providing opportunities for exploration.\n\nBut despite that flaw. Once you get the levels down you'll get fast paced action with dynamic events and seriously immersive characters to play as. This game is easily a 4/5 game back then and now. Still worth playing even if you aren't a Alien (or Predator) fan. Becuse you won't experience anything in its entirety again or as good.","December 1, 2013","true","13.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Of course, a highly advanced alien race does more damage and more kills than a marine with a gun that still shoots metal projectiles.\nAnd in a world where everyone knows, you're there somewhere, and has nightvision or movement radar, obviously isn't that surprised or scared to be charged by an alien. You just have to teach them, that high-tech equipment and almost infinite healthpoint or infite torches to enlighten the entire room (and the room of the player with it), is not enough against cunning, patience and speed.\n\nThe Predators do have the most easy game, but are still slow when it comes to changing or reloading weapons, they have to hit when they shoot. Just know what the other races can do and this game may still be balanced.\n\nThe singleplayer lacks in "good" tasks, in my opinion. You always have to fight your way through some enemies, which can either kill with one shot (aliens need some tactics!) or not at all (predators are true tanks, aim well and own everything!). The alien campaign is the most fun one, because of this somewhat new feeling of being melee only in a world of ranged weapons.\n\nThis game belonged to our top 5 LAN games some years ago and we played many hours scaring our friends with a suddenly dropped alien at the place where your partner was 2 seconds ago.

Aliens...Predators...Colonial Marines, oh my.\n\nThe Good:  Albeit an old, "Classic" game, it's got good, solid controls.  The storyline is decently thought out for the 3 types of campaigns (one for each race), although sadly, they're a bit on the short side.  Where this game shines, though, is the multiplayer.  Aliens are quick and fragile (although they can heal themselves), but are primarily melee fighters.  Predators are big, hulking brutes (that go invisible...actually more of a drawback, though) with a few big guns.  Colonial Marines...they're...well...Humans...but man do they have a LOT of guns.\n\nThe Bad:  The campaigns are short, as previously mentioned.  Graphics, if that matters to you, are...well, dated.  And the Aliens' vision...what, at the time, was called Fishbowl Vision, can be...disconcerting (120 view, versus the normal 90 view).  And finally, and sadly, although multiplayer is where the game shines, it's sorely lacking in maps...and since it's such an old game, there's little to no chance of any fan-made content for it.\n\nThe Ugly:  The user interface is...weird.  Although you can use a mouse to look around...there is no actual mouse use on the menues.  That's really it...and even then, that's more of a personal inconvenience instead of a really bad feature.\n\nOverall...I think this game rates a 4.5 out of 5.  A great game, a great multiplayer experience.","December 7, 2013","true","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ye_Poopsock/recommended/3730/","Ye_Poopsock","Ye Poopsock","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ye_Poopsock/","333 products in account","This is a good game despite it's age. Why? Because it has something to offer that not a single game that not even the sequels got right. Three distinctive characters to play as with different play styles that are done particularly well in their own aspects. Levels that are short yet sweet like a mission from Metal Slug and not feeling bloated like Skyrim where most of the content is crap.\n\nLet's start off with the marine campaign. You play as a Colonial Marine who wakes up from a bad dream and finds out Xenomorphs are loose aboard the research station on LV-426. The story is you do menial tasks to get rid of those pesky xenos. But the story isn't the attraction to this game anyway. The game mechanics are the attraction. Each level was designed with speed running and fast paced game action in mind. Your character moves very fast (all three of them do). Your weapon arsenal is powerful for the Marine and Predator. The combat is sudden because enemies are procedurally generated in different positions throughout levels and infinitely to encourage you to keep going and not bringing the game to a halt. This means you'll never find this game to be a slog in it's pacing. There's no story sequences that bring the game to halt whatsoever. The means of telling the story is completely optional for you to listen to. While playing as the marine you'll realize you can't manually reload your weapons. This actually doesn't hinder the game as one would think it would. As your weapons contain so much firepower and reload time is so quick it will be after an engagement. Not during. If it is during one you can use your agility to avoid attacks. Still keeping the pacing up. The levels themselves are open to exploration. But the drawback to them is they can be very maze like sometimes. An obvious flaw to a good game.\n\nBut the sequences themselves are so cool you'll keep wanting to play. In Episode III in the marine campaign, I found myself encountering regular Xenomorphs and face huggers. The face huggers themselves are quite the surprise. I was torching 4 Xenos that cornered me in a hall with my flamethrower. All of them popping like water balloons filled with acid as it rains all over the steel corridors. But I see I have one more enemy near me on my radar. I toss a flare and the hall lights up. And out a facehugger pounces around the corner and cling to my face! The neat thing about this was it wasn't scripted at all. Scenarios like these provide replay value beyond the speed running to play. Something that the sequels sorely missed.\n\nThe predator himself plays like a pseudo stealth action game character at speed running with powerful weapons and a focus on melee attacks too. The first levels you'll find yourself uppercutting marines with your claws while cloaked as they dim wittily walk around in dark areas filled with more than just Xenos and bunny hopping around corridors and over cliffs. Against Xenos you'll find yourself popping off their body limbs with your claws, accurately predicting their movements do you pin them against walls with your spear gun, or just blasting them away your shoulder cannon in a super cool vision mode just like the movies!\n\nThing is about killing the Xenos as either Marine or   Predator. You have to be somewhat tactical about killing them. They'll still spray acid fluids about after death. As a marine it will chew away your armor and health like you wouldn't believe. It'll kill you as fast as you can kill them when you get cornered and blast them away with your minigun. Killing Xenos with your claws as a predator has to be quick and efficient. You charge up, let them come to you, and let it loose and step away.\n\nPlaying as the Xenomorph reduces you to melee attacks and being able to climb anything. Simple as it is. It really works. The FOV is bigger so you can see well. Sticking to walls and wall jumping is easy as hit the CTRL button when landing. Holding it if you want to stay on that surface. You can move just as easy when holding it too! You are reduced to claws, biting enemy heads which does a lot of damage and gives you health, and a tail charge attack. You must use stealth and hit and run tactics to take out enemies. You'll be crawling on ceilings, leaping fifty feet, and delivering a timed tail attack to stab right through some jarhead's skull. It's the weakest of the three. But still manages to be good fun.\n\nDespite all this. This game has a serious flaw that needs to be brought up. The level design is highly unintuitive. It will be very maze like for first time players and very hard to spot important mission progressions in the dark environments. Some parts of the levels are copy pasted too much. You'll see the same room and halls like five times. But thankfully the linearity keeps from being like Doom 2's crap levels yet still providing opportunities for exploration.\n\nBut despite that flaw. Once you get the levels down you'll get fast paced action with dynamic events and seriously immersive characters to play as. This game is easily a 4/5 game back then and now. Still worth playing even if you aren't a Alien (or Predator) fan. Becuse you won't experience anything in its entirety again or as good.","December 1, 2013","true","13.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The Alien gameplay was fast and savage, with a fragile player who had to use stealth and speed to tack down vastly superior targets.  The Predator was a superpowered murder god of technology.  The Marine was a slow, underpowered, well armed, tasty treat who ran like hell.\n\nWhile it is closest to the traditional FPS, the Marine gameplay is my favorite, as each level was a struggle to survive against an enemy that came at you.  No trigger, no prespawned xenos, just a spawn point and the hunt.  That was the first revelation that actually made me pause when playing, that I wasn't in a war, or pursuing a target, but I was the one being hunted.\n\nGrab a rifle, throw a flare, and run.","January 26, 2014","true","18.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Single player is as tough as first person shooters get and multiplayer is super fast.\n\nA lot of stealth is required when you're an alien or predator in single player and as a marine it becomes more of a survival horror even though you're tooled up to the eyeballs.\n\nMultiplayer is a lot of fun. I particularly like last man standing. In this mode its marines versus one alien or predator. Every time it kills a marine they come back as the same race that killed them. They then join the original predator or alien in killing the other marines, this pattern is repeated right down to the last marine. There are several modes and maps and it's all super fast gameplay. Seriously the aliens in particular run faster than The Flash. Try playing marines only at the office, it's the best fun me and a mate had in multiplayer.\n\nBeing an old game this is not for shallow gamers who for them graphics are everything.

It connects best of both worlds, as a colonial marine for example you will both experience hectic skirmishes with hordes of xenomorphs, akin to Aliens movie and more horror-like moments of exploration, with unnerving beeps of your motion tracker breaking the silence. For those who haven't played this: it might be a nice oldschool game to taste. For those who did play AVP and enjoyed it, it's a must buy.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ye_Poopsock/recommended/3730/","Ye_Poopsock","Ye Poopsock","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ye_Poopsock/","333 products in account","This is a good game despite it's age. Why? Because it has something to offer that not a single game that not even the sequels got right. Three distinctive characters to play as with different play styles that are done particularly well in their own aspects. Levels that are short yet sweet like a mission from Metal Slug and not feeling bloated like Skyrim where most of the content is crap.\n\nLet's start off with the marine campaign. You play as a Colonial Marine who wakes up from a bad dream and finds out Xenomorphs are loose aboard the research station on LV-426. The story is you do menial tasks to get rid of those pesky xenos. But the story isn't the attraction to this game anyway. The game mechanics are the attraction. Each level was designed with speed running and fast paced game action in mind. Your character moves very fast (all three of them do). Your weapon arsenal is powerful for the Marine and Predator. The combat is sudden because enemies are procedurally generated in different positions throughout levels and infinitely to encourage you to keep going and not bringing the game to a halt. This means you'll never find this game to be a slog in it's pacing. There's no story sequences that bring the game to halt whatsoever. The means of telling the story is completely optional for you to listen to. While playing as the marine you'll realize you can't manually reload your weapons. This actually doesn't hinder the game as one would think it would. As your weapons contain so much firepower and reload time is so quick it will be after an engagement. Not during. If it is during one you can use your agility to avoid attacks. Still keeping the pacing up. The levels themselves are open to exploration. But the drawback to them is they can be very maze like sometimes. An obvious flaw to a good game.\n\nBut the sequences themselves are so cool you'll keep wanting to play. In Episode III in the marine campaign, I found myself encountering regular Xenomorphs and face huggers. The face huggers themselves are quite the surprise. I was torching 4 Xenos that cornered me in a hall with my flamethrower. All of them popping like water balloons filled with acid as it rains all over the steel corridors. But I see I have one more enemy near me on my radar. I toss a flare and the hall lights up. And out a facehugger pounces around the corner and cling to my face! The neat thing about this was it wasn't scripted at all. Scenarios like these provide replay value beyond the speed running to play. Something that the sequels sorely missed.\n\nThe predator himself plays like a pseudo stealth action game character at speed running with powerful weapons and a focus on melee attacks too. The first levels you'll find yourself uppercutting marines with your claws while cloaked as they dim wittily walk around in dark areas filled with more than just Xenos and bunny hopping around corridors and over cliffs. Against Xenos you'll find yourself popping off their body limbs with your claws, accurately predicting their movements do you pin them against walls with your spear gun, or just blasting them away your shoulder cannon in a super cool vision mode just like the movies!\n\nThing is about killing the Xenos as either Marine or   Predator. You have to be somewhat tactical about killing them. They'll still spray acid fluids about after death. As a marine it will chew away your armor and health like you wouldn't believe. It'll kill you as fast as you can kill them when you get cornered and blast them away with your minigun. Killing Xenos with your claws as a predator has to be quick and efficient. You charge up, let them come to you, and let it loose and step away.\n\nPlaying as the Xenomorph reduces you to melee attacks and being able to climb anything. Simple as it is. It really works. The FOV is bigger so you can see well. Sticking to walls and wall jumping is easy as hit the CTRL button when landing. Holding it if you want to stay on that surface. You can move just as easy when holding it too! You are reduced to claws, biting enemy heads which does a lot of damage and gives you health, and a tail charge attack. You must use stealth and hit and run tactics to take out enemies. You'll be crawling on ceilings, leaping fifty feet, and delivering a timed tail attack to stab right through some jarhead's skull. It's the weakest of the three. But still manages to be good fun.\n\nDespite all this. This game has a serious flaw that needs to be brought up. The level design is highly unintuitive. It will be very maze like for first time players and very hard to spot important mission progressions in the dark environments. Some parts of the levels are copy pasted too much. You'll see the same room and halls like five times. But thankfully the linearity keeps from being like Doom 2's crap levels yet still providing opportunities for exploration.\n\nBut despite that flaw. Once you get the levels down you'll get fast paced action with dynamic events and seriously immersive characters to play as. This game is easily a 4/5 game back then and now. Still worth playing even if you aren't a Alien (or Predator) fan. Becuse you won't experience anything in its entirety again or as good.","December 1, 2013","true","13.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is where it is at.\nThe controls are fantastic and while it's an older title it captures the feel of the races far better than the newer edition.\n\nSound effects are incredible. Listening to the motion tracker and that ping of movement will get you every time. Especially once the facehuggers come into play.\nAlien and predator sounds are straight from the films and easily recogniseable.\n\nThe only real downside is the lack of story and shortness of the missions.\nDifficulty is more-so a ramp up of damage than an increase in foes or lack of supplies.\n\nWhile there is only 5 - 6 missions per race, they are rather good and provide a challenge and good use of all the races' skills.\n\nMultiplayer is really where this game shines though.

The solid multiplayer experience is very rawly balanced between the 3 species, dumbed down by the very fast pace of movement speed and high attack damage.

Aliens...Predators...Colonial Marines, oh my.\n\nThe Good:  Albeit an old, "Classic" game, it's got good, solid controls.  The storyline is decently thought out for the 3 types of campaigns (one for each race), although sadly, they're a bit on the short side.  Where this game shines, though, is the multiplayer.  Aliens are quick and fragile (although they can heal themselves), but are primarily melee fighters.  Predators are big, hulking brutes (that go invisible...actually more of a drawback, though) with a few big guns.  Colonial Marines...they're...well...Humans...but man do they have a LOT of guns.\n\nThe Bad:  The campaigns are short, as previously mentioned.  Graphics, if that matters to you, are...well, dated.  And the Aliens' vision...what, at the time, was called Fishbowl Vision, can be...disconcerting (120 view, versus the normal 90 view).  And finally, and sadly, although multiplayer is where the game shines, it's sorely lacking in maps...and since it's such an old game, there's little to no chance of any fan-made content for it.\n\nThe Ugly:  The user interface is...weird.  Although you can use a mouse to look around...there is no actual mouse use on the menues.  That's really it...and even then, that's more of a personal inconvenience instead of a really bad feature.\n\nOverall...I think this game rates a 4.5 out of 5.  A great game, a great multiplayer experience.","December 7, 2013","true","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Aliens versus Predator might not have spearheaded the original asymmetric-type gameplay, but no other game at the time did it with quite the same verve and intensity. And what personality! Playing as either titular creatures (and the Marine campaign aside) still feels satisfactory and distinct. Attention to detail is all here, all the down to the "five finger fillet" knife from the movie. It intermingles moments of breakneck ferocity (For Alien and Predator players) with sheer terror (For Marines) without missing a beat.\n\nLike I said. It holds up. AVP Classic still scratches that itch for arcade-y action that does both of its franchises proud. It's always fun to dive in and attack one of the bonus levels on the hardest difficulty and watch the limbs fly, long after you've finished its multiple campaigns.

First of all the sound is spot on being rippped out straght from the moives! The music is not however it is still very good to listen too, especially in action parts! Graphic are not the best but come on, it came out in 1998 give it  a break (they are not that bad for the time). Gameply is very fun and unique for each race. As the Alien you must run fast, be sneaky and take out your foes. As marine you go guns blazing. I am not a fan of the predator however so sorry. The campains (even tho i have not beaten them yet) are vey fun and have a decent story to them. Only problem is that there is no objective marker so you can get lost easily. Multilayer  is also Very with many kinds of gamemode you can play (you will mostly fine DM, SDM or coop survival.)\n\nSo overal i give this game a 9.5/10 only reason not a full 10/10 is cause of the few glitches and the VERY OP predator in mutilpayer. Other than that this is a must have any AvP fan! :)","December 23, 2015","true","28.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

Finally, I love the atmosphere, especially in the first marine campaign (did i meantion you can play xenomorph, predator, and marines?????) i got a lovely couple of jumpscares. mainly due to your character walking faster than the Flash can run XDDDDD","October 4, 2015","true","1.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

Simple as that. Half-Life came out a year or so before this, and unlike many games that then followed, AVP aschews almost all pretence of a narrative. In this way it feels like a darker, scarier Doom. It is a literal run-and-gun game, and incomparible to almost anything contemporary, even to it's own sequel, which is a vastly different experience.\n\nAVP is also brutally difficult, and requires the player to have fast reflexes while also keep their wits about them as the blaze through the corridors. Kill anything that moves, and kill it quick. This makes for a tense and frenetic game, and facehuggers whipping out of no-where to one-hit-kill me always makes me jump.\n\nThis won't be everyone's cup of tea, especially if you're migrating backwards from AVP2, hoping for more of the same. But with the few tools at its disposal, playing AVP is a uniquely exhilirating experience and rewards a skillful (and lucky) player with the few minutes of well-earned rest at the end of each level before the next one begins.\n\nI recommend this if you have a few bucks to spare and you're after a fast, simple, challenging FPS.","April 17","true","2.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

Fast pace twitch arena shooter in the style of Quake of the original Doom games. The species are amazingly well balanced while retaining authenticity to their respective franchises. Each species has their unique play style and abilities. Aliens can climb any where and are very fast. It is best to strike out of the shadows. Predators has advanced weapons(very strong spear gun, and autolock shoulder canon) but their vision modes can only identify one species of the time unless using regular vision which does not support autolock. Marines can upgrade their arsenal a lot and are the closest to traditional FPS. Aliens can recuperate health by eating species they kill and Predators have a health inject but Predators cloaking, health, and shoulder canon operate on a battery supply.\n\nDefinitely get it if you're a fan of either franchise. The campaigns are all unique and fun as well but it shines in multiplayer.","May 4","true","6.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's got good controls and an almost QUAKE style of movement where you can almost outrun the aliens without any serious impact on accuracy. This is very much an early 2000's shooter, and still retains the charm of games of the era while still being appreciable for the modern times.\n\nThe problems come about when it comes to the story mode, primarily. The Marine is probably the best character with a wide array of weapons to choose from, very little platforming necessary, and with probably the minimal amount of save scumming required. The predator come second, because again, diverse weapons and limited platforming, but with the bonus of being able to cloak and use genuine stealth tactics appropriate for the early 2000s. But then comes the Alien. The xenomorph is undoubtedly one of the most unplayable characters, and this seems to be a trend among games featuring the Alien because platforming is a huge deal, which can be a problem. When you're a marine or a predator, you can find your way around because you're only limited to the floor. The alien, meanwhile, can go everywhere there's a surface, which means you'll spend a bunch of time crawling on walls and ceilings and ultimately end up lost without a walkthrough. While all the characters necessitate a walkthrough, because this did come from the age when video games hated telling the player things, it gets even worse when you can literally end up lost in the vents for a good thirty minutes going in circles at about 100 miles per hour.\n\nThe combat is pretty solid for all characters. Enemies become easily detatched from their limbs, flames and explosions are catastrophic, and when you hit some dude with lazer forged wristblades he's not gonna have a good time. The marine is exclusively ranged, the alien is exclusively melee, and the predator contains a mix of the two.\n\nThe graphics are actually pretty nice for a game made in 2000. Imagine Oblivion or Fallout 3 but with super primitive articulation. The textures can be a bit of a problem, as they never seem to mask when a wall or a floor is outright flat, making it especially hard to find a switch that just blends into the graphic.\n\nAll in all, I'd recommend checking a playthrough of the game played in Skirmish mode before actually buying it. It'd be good to get on sale to try out, as it stands on the combat alone, but if you're going to do any of the stories make sure to have a walkthrough available because one can not be faulted for getting stuck in the story.","May 18","true","0.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
