It's based on the Extended Cut version of the game, which means it has redone graphics and two extra levels when compared to the original Wii release. If you get bored of typing, you can also play the entire shooting version of the game, which works pretty differently, meaning you basically get two games for the price of one.\n\nIt must be said that the typing side of the game isn't nearly as interesting or unique as the original Typing of the Dead, boss fights don't have fun gimmicks like answering questions correctly or being forced not to make any errors, and the difficulty remains pretty low through the whole game, even on the hardest difficulty, while in the original it was adjusted depending on how well you were doing. Still heavily recommended, just try to play the original as well somehow, because it's definitely better.","November 25, 2013","true","24.0"," 288 of 313 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","288","313","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/xelios/recommended/246580/","xelios","Xelios","http://steamcommunity.com/id/xelios/","4978 products in account","In The Typing of the Dead: Overkill you play as a special agent who partners up with a potty-mouthed detective to track down the villain Papa Ceasar and save the county from a mutant outbreak.  The story unfolds over nine episodes and combines horror with potentially disturbing, over-the-top comedy.\n\nThe game is a reworked version of the first-person rail shooter The House of the Dead: Overkill - Extended Cut, in which the shooting mechanics of combat have been replaced by quickly and accurately typing words and phrases that appear on screen.  Words are randomly chosen, so they are different every time you play, and multiple difficulty levels are available to provide a challenge for typists of varying skill levels.\n\nA port of the Playstation 3 version of House of the Dead: Overkill - Extended Cut is also included so, if you type exclusively with your index fingers or simply don’t enjoy the activity, you can always take out zombies the old-fashioned way.  In this mode, you must aim and shoot traditionally and may buy and upgrade guns after each episode with the cash you were quick enough to grab.\n\nMovement and camera are on pre-determined paths so the experience feels like taking a ride through a haunted house at the fair, allowing you to focus on destroying zombies, picking up collectibles, rescuing civilians and racking up your high score.  Boss fights at the end of each episode are well-designed and two-player co-op is a lot of fun, but it is possible to frequently encounter bugs in multiplayer that require you to restart the episode, such as words not appearing properly or the game desyncing and freezing.\n\nSince the game involves dialogue littered with profanity (F bombs), plenty of gore, and touches on themes like incest and making fun of the handicapped, it’s not for the squeamish or those who may be offended by such things.  If you don’t take your entertainment too seriously and can handle the outrageous content, it’s very much worth the quick, three-to-four-hour playthrough, but no one would blame you if you couldn’t.","January 3, 2014","true","5.4"," 142 of 154 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","142","154","0","2"

Your point of view moves through the game world automatically, all you have to do is type every word that floats into view in order to kill the zombies. About capitalization, spaces, or punctuation you do not have to worry. How fast the zombies in front of you will attack is indicated by the colour surrounding the words.\nThe words that pop up are randomised, so each player's experience of the game is unique.\nThe storyline is presented cinematically with film scratches, a psychedelic "intermission" screen when data is being loaded. Each of the 9 chapters arrive with a movie trailer voiceover that perfectly captures the spirit of the cheap golden age of bad movies.\nBesides of the normal game mode there is a little arcade mode of mini-games where you can try out a survival mode with forever-spawning waves of zombies. The game also comes with the full version of the House of the Dead: Overkill, so you can play through it with mouse or controller if you want.\nThe game can also be played cooperatively.\nThe graphics are bad. The textures and models look pretty miserably when you are playing.\nThe sound and dialogues can be really annoying after a while.\nHowever, I think criticising it for being ugly is to miss the point. The game is funny with hilarious characters and overall an enjoyable game that I would recommend if you want to improve your typing ability.\n\nSounds 6/10\nGraphics 5/10\nGameplay 8/10\nAtmosphere 7/10\n\nIf you liked my review, please feel free to follow me and/or my curator group:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/id/Ov3RT4K3R/myworkshopfiles/?section=guides\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/orcollective#curation","October 2, 2014","true","20.6"," 85 of 92 people (92%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","92","85","92","5","0"

I loved the hilarious, cheesy B-movie dialogue and the nonsensical story.  And the gameplay itself was various, different, and entertaining.\n\nThe story isn’t written that seriously and the dialogue fits perfectly with intentional cheesy lines and some just plain hilarious writing.  I played through the game a total of 4 times (for achievements) and I found myself watching the cutscenes -almost- every time because they just entertained me that much.  The voice acting was pretty good overall; even when it faltered, it still fit the overall ambiance of the game anyway.\n\nThe typing mode is the selling point of the game.  It definitely provided me with a novel experience; I don’t think I have played a game with a mechanic like there is in this before. The original Typing of the Dead came out in 1999, but I had never played anything like it until now.  I enjoyed it a lot.  Playing on hard, with DLC and/or workshop content can make it a lot of fun with various hilarious things to type out as fast as you can without making a mistake.\n\nThe classic mode was also enjoyable to me.  It is an on-rails shooter, staying true to the original, light-gun arcade style.  It definitely brought on some nostalgia playing it.\n\nStaying true to the hilarious, light-hearted nature of the game it is not difficult at all.  You have unlimited continues, so even if you mess up you just keep going (and don’t even have to drop in another quarter).  There is no backtracking required too.\n\nThe graphics were not the best, but it’s mostly intentional:  there is supposed to be an old-school, drive-in, grindhouse feel to the game.  However one thing that isn't intentional and occurs on a lot of user’s systems is that random parts of the models (an arm, both arms, the head, all of the above) of the mutant-zombies will pop in and out… and this did occur in my game too.  It didn’t really bother me that much in the typing mode because I was focused on the sentences, but in the classic mode it was a little disappointing shooting at invisible, un-rendered mutant-zombie heads.  There may even be ways to fix it depending on your system, but you will have to look into that yourself.\n\nIf you are a gamer who is looking for a taste of something different and novel, or a taste of something from ghosts of arcades past, this game has an offering of both.  With the available workshop content the typing mode has limitless possibilities.  Mix all that with some hilarious scenes, and homage to cheesy, horror B-movies and you get a just simply entertaining experience.\n\nFollow my curation page to see more of my recommendations!","April 27, 2015","true","12.9"," 79 of 85 people (93%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","93","79","85","4","4"

I'd played House of the Dead in the arcades, and I liked the idea of incorporating typing into the popular rail shooter.  I played it for a while, had fun, laughed at the stupid jokes and extreme over-acting of it all, and then pretty much shelved it for awhile.\n\nA few days ago, I got my first mechanical keyboard (Corsair K65 RGB, Cherry MX Reds).  Then I remembered I owned this game, so I redownloaded it and I can honestly say that this game went from kinda fun to EXTREMELY fun.\n\nWith mechanical keys, my average score in the game is around 91%.  Definitely a different experience.  I almost wanna say you won't have any real fun in this unless 1) You love typing, and 2) You have a badass mechanical keyboard to play it.\n\nAs for the game itself, if you've ever played a rail shooter before, it's pretty standard.  Game moves on its own, zombies come at you and instead of using a light gun, you use your keyboard and type the words, terms, or sentences below the zombies.  Type it out correctly, and you kill the zombie.  Do it quick enough and you'll get a headshot.\n\nIf there are multiple zombies on screen, it'll use red arrows and a flashing border around the word to let you know you should dispatch THIS zombie first, or you'll get slapped.\n\nThe game mixes it up a lot.  Some zombies will throw stuff at you, and rather than concentrate on the word below them, you wanna shoot the single letter attached to the object flying at your face, and THEN take the zombie out.\n\nSome words, terms, and sentences are longer than others, especially if you have some of the dictionary DLCs installed.  Also, get in the habit of hitting TAB periodically, as there are various green health packs, slow-mo power ups, game music tracks, and game artwork that can be collected.\n\nThe jokes are over-the-top, the monsters are disgustingly awesome, and my typing score is getting better and better.

I had no interest in seeking any sort of challenge as this is the perfect game to play in short bursts after a long tiresome day. Each act is rather short so it won’t take you much time to complete meaning that, if you just ended a long, busy day, if you are dead tired or just want a mindless game without the need to focus a lot on Story elements or harsh gameplay mechanics, this game might be just what you need.\n\nIn Typing of the Dead you play in a Story where two characters who appear to have nothing in common must join forces to defeat a biggest problem than their own personality: Papa Caesar. Responsible (or is it…?) for the outbreak filled with Zombies from all sorts of sizes and horrible habits and for the murder (or maybe not…?) of one of character’s father death, you must play through 9 exciting Acts coming to you in a cheap Hollywood horror movie form. The acting is one of the worst you can expect, but, in a good, funny way. Same goes for the jokes that are so bad that they end up being quite funny due the excessive amount of randomness they represent.\n\nYour weapon can be two: Either your own Keyboard, where typing is key as you need to write as fast as possible to engage in combos, avoid damage and score even more points or your mouse to point and shoot. What you type, however is up to you. Whether you are playing the base or not there’s a lot to choose from when it comes to the vocabulary. There are 5 DLCs (I own 4 of them) which can focus more on a certain theme when it comes to what you type. While I found it funny it was a challenge for me since not only I found out I’m incredible slow at typing but also, English is not my native language. I feel this game can improve your typing skills but when it comes to improve your language I’m not so sure. Unless you are interested in the most random sort of things to call at someone.\n\nVisuals are decent enough. They are not modern visuals by any means but this game should not be played for its visuals either way. The sound however, felt a bit of a letdown. Every time I had to use some sort of QTE to kill a bigger enemy (in both modes) the sound/music would go lower and some narration as well other sound effects would get completely silenced for a short period of time. I don’t know if the Developers are aware of this or if they intend to solve this issue.\n\nAside of the two different modes you can play there are also 3 Mini-games: “Victim Support”, “Stayin’ Alive” and “Money Shot II”. These can be fun as something to play between longer/deep games in order to fill those dead times. Finally, there is also Collectibles in this game. You can collect from Comic Book pages to Soundtracks to play in your Jukebox, Concept Art and also 3D Models from the characters and enemies. As in mostly games, they are completely optional.

The look and story are a parody on exploitation kind of movies, with lots of vulgar and violent themes. Two agents team up to make their way through all kinds of places like buildings, sewers, a stripclub, and even a swamp. On their way to find the great evil crime lord 'Papa Caesar', they shoot (or I should say type) their way through hordes of zombies Mutants to get to their goal.\n\nThe typing elements in this game are really good, if you're familiar with the basics of blind typing then you're good to go. It's even more fun if you're a fast typer, you can challenge yourself on the hardest difficulty, and turn on the 'Hardcore'-option, to make no mistakes. After you've finished a level, you can view your typing stats. It's truly enjoyable if you like typing. You might even improve your skills a little bit.\n\nWhile this is a reboot in the series of The House of the Dead, don't expect it to be like the old games on the Dreamcast. It's got a completely new charm. The game has a decent amount of stuff to offer. It's a good port of the original game with lots of content and minigames. In every level there are collectables to get, which vary from viewable 3D-models to Audio tracks. The game also comes with the original 'The House of the Dead: Overkill', which is essentially the same game with mouse/controller option, but with weapon upgrades. It's fun to replay a level on a harder difficulty to challenge yourself, so the replayability is decent as well.\n\nTyping was never this hilarious before. With an over the top story and lots of swearing, violence and vulgarity, this game offers a fun and unique way to see how good you are at typing and to enjoy an on-rail shooter. If you like typing and zombies, then I can recommend this.","January 25, 2015","true","20.9"," 20 of 23 people (87%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","87","20","23","5","1"

Your keyboard is your weapon.\n\nThe typing of the dead is about typing fast, and firing off as many shots as you can as quickly as you can with each letter you type. This game could only appeal to those gamer's who for whatever reason, like typing as quick as they can or like practicing their typing skills.\n\nThe story mode does it's best to go as ludicrous as possible. Two of our main characters are lunatic gunmen who love their dialogue. It's entertaining, while some may find it tacky or simply corny. One of the first things I noticed in this game mode is that zombies were missing half their body at times (check screen shots). The word that you needed to type would be there, but only the zombies head or maybe arms were present. So in this regard, game-play will not be affected (only your eyes)! There are different modes in the game such as mini-games, multiplayer, and even an overkill mode. Without these different modes, I'm sure the game would get old... very fast. What bugs me to an extreme extent is the game ignores commas and spaces. I tried the easiest to the hardest difficulty and in no way does that matter for punctuation, spaces, or dashes. I would say for a typing game, you can't simply ignore punctuation if you are going to include it in the game. At the very least, include it in the difficulty.\n\nEven with some zombies missing their torso, I still like the game as it gives me a reason to practice my typing. Some gamer's may find it quickly boring, some may actually like the arcade set style Sega used in this. Graphics overall are respectable and will remind the gamer of playing at an arcade machine. Sounds are okay simply as they do not vary between gun shot sounds and zombies. The voice acting is pretty lucrative and creative though!\n\nOne complaint though, I can't change video settings... only brightness. Also, the loading times at certain screens are brutal.\n\n\nRATING : 6.9/10\n\n\nGameplay	B-	Story / Campaign	B-	Visuals / User Interface	C+	Sounds / Music	B-	Replay-ability	C	Overall 	C+\n\nUpon completing the game, I like it. I like the fact your keyboard is your weapon. I do however, have an issue with random words that won't be used. Yes, seeing vulgar words are funny, but I feel the game should strive for actually improving our typing skills through a good game. What they did for the final boss  with the chain gun allowing you to type whatever words you'd like  was a great way to end the game.\n\nScreenShots :\nA "mutant" missing their torso + extra added gimmick in game play\n\nOverkill game mode in lieu of the classic typing game mode\n\nMore clipping\n\nOne of the mini-game modes\n\nBesides shooting zombies, you'll have to regularly react and choose whether to shoot away the knife (W) or go at the zombie first","May 31, 2015","true","3.8"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","81","13","16","2","0"

I don't see it going over very well if you don't know the basics, but if you do it can be a pretty effective tool, even if it wasn't exactly designed for this purpose.\n\nI wasn't a very good typist when I started. I tested myself online after my first game session and was around 18 wpm with frequent glances at the keyboard. I've treated playing the game like lessons, set periods on a schedule. I usually play 3 chapters a weeknight, which equals about an hour to an hour and a half long sessions.  I started on the lowest difficulty and worked my way up. As I said, this game isn't exactly designed as a teaching tool. If you suck at typing, you die a lot. I was dying as much as a dozen times a stage early on. You'll pretty much have to ignore scoring at this point and just focus on progressing.\n\nIt's worth noting that I had a pretty bad handicap early on: I didn't know you could pick up items with tab. I assumed the pickups were only for playing the game the traditional way. They give you a single hint about this early on, but it completely went over my head and didn't give it much more thought. On the plus side, this gave me some pretty raw data for seeing my skills progress, as my score and deaths weren't being affected by collectibles and health.\n\nAs I said, I died a lot in the beginning, but by the time I was a few hours in I didn’t have to look at the keyboard anymore. I really started to notice an improvement with my speed when I began the first stage on the hardest difficulty, after completing the easier two. The parts of that stage's boss that had been giving me trouble suddenly weren’t so bad. I think I died once on that attempt, which was far and away a new record. I eventually stalled out toward the end of that play through and decided to scale it back to the medium difficulty for a while. Now I'm trying the hardcore mode on easy to force me to work on accuracy. Seems to be working so far.\n\nIt's been three weeks since I started this, 17 hours of play according to steam. I tested myself again at the end of this last session and got 39 WPM (followed by a fist pump). With these results, I don't see myself stopping this routine for a while. Sure beats those mundane online lessons I looked at a while back.\n\nNow, as for the game itself.  It’s pretty fun. You can play the game traditional rail shooter style with the mouse, but I only did a single level so I don’t have a lot of experience on that part. 3 Hours is about one playthrough, and that’s a fair time for something like this. The higher difficulties and Hardcore mode will give you more to do afterward. They’ve also been releasing DLC libraries to expand the pool of words the game will throw at you. They help keep things varied, but I wouldn’t pay more than a dollar or so for them. There are some mini games, but they aren’t anything overly special.\n\nI should also probably mention that this isn’t the highest quality port. It’s nothing really bad, but you may run into some glitchy parts. Specifically, everyone apparently has some sound issues during the “hammertime” kill on the Rage mutants, and one of them always clips into the ground when he runs toward you. I also have had one of the bosses glitch out and stun himself on occasion. Less bothersome, the gallery takes forever to load, to the point you might think it’s stuck.  Besides these and the “invincible zombie” glitch I ran into once, that’s pretty much the worst of it, so nothing to write the purchase off over.\n\nAnd now for game content.  It’s really, really vulgar. The violent was a given, but I would have been completely blown away by the ridiculous amount of language if I hadn’t read about it before hand. It’s extremely obvious the game is grindhouse and exploitation parody, but that doesn’t stop the obscenities from grating your ears. This game had the Guinness record for the videogame with the most uses of the f-word for a year. Mafia 2 now has that record, but at least that game doesn’t cram the words into a 3 hour period. To answer another question no one seems to tackle, you won’t be typing a lot of obscenities yourself. I’ve typed “Oh ♥♥♥♥!”, ” damned” and “damnation”(offensiveness debatable), “♥♥♥♥♥♥♥”, and “♥♥♥♥♥”, I think. So it’s like 1 in 700 or so. If you want to type vulgarities for some reason look into the “Filth” DLC. As for sexuality and nudity, I’ve seen worse. A couple of characters are strippers, but there’s no nudity in the traditional sense (as for that last boss though… *shutter*).\n\nSo, if you want to improve your typing or just kill zombies through the least likely of manners, and you think you can handle the obscene content, give the game a go, I’m glad I did. It sure helped to make typing all this out easier.\n","January 18, 2015","true","24.0"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","10","11","0","0"

It really tests your typing skills while delivering a hilarious story. This is one of the most entertaining games I've played in a long time. It's a short game, broken down into chapters, each chapter with a B horror movie spoof cut scene. The characters are ridiculous and completely over-the-top. It's almost deliberately awful, full of profanity, sexual innuendo, gore, and crazy love affairs. Isaac Washington swears nearly every other word, sometimes multiple words in a row, and while some may be turned off by this, it's one of the comedic highlights of the story and is actually relevant to the relationship building between Washington and Agent G. There are some great quotable lines, but nothing appropriate to display (in case kids are reading).\n\nThe gameplay is very simple. Words pop up. You type. There are three difficulty settings. They are introducing new dictionaries as DLC to expand the words that you need to type. Each level has collectibles. A co-op mode is included, but I haven't tried that yet.\n\nYou can also play the game with shooting instead of typing, though I found this a little difficult to do with a mouse. The typing mode is more fun anyways. There's a variety of mini-games. They are okay, but I only played each once.\n\nObviously the graphics are dated since this was a Dreamcast game. I think it still looks fine. The soundtrack is good and fits the game well.\n\nIf you're looking for a game you can play in 20 minute increments when you need to pass some time, this is a great choice.

I can't really recommend that portion of the game though.

It features two game modes - one, where you should type words in order to shoot your enemies' brains out, and the classic one, where you shoot zombies with your mouse cursor, using a wide range of upgradable weapons. Both modes support co-op, but sadly achievements don't unlock while playing in co-op. There are also several mini-games there as well.\nWhat really makes this game an epic experience is the trash/exploitation/grindhouse atmosphere style of cinematics in between missions. The whole game is presented in a form of 70s-80s low-budget zombie exploitation flick with characters, jokes and dialogues typical to such setting. I completely laughed my ♥♥♥ off several times during the playthrough.\nI cannot recommend this game to just anyone but if you happen to like and enjoy the abovementioned stuff, this is definitely the game to get your hands on. I recommend getting it when this title goes on sale or has some discount.","September 24, 2014","true","20.2"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

The humour is the same, incredibly satire and tongue-in-cheek, making jokes at itself and the situation, that situation being typing to kill zombies.\n\nSo, let's talk about the game itself, as a typing game. It's pretty good.\n\nThe strongest parts of the games are the "progression" through levels, killing zombies, picking up powerups, and unlocking unlockable all using rapidly typed words on screen. The difficult has different modes, and as someone who has tested with 120+wpm, I found the extreme difficulty to be the perfect level for what I was expecting.\n\nThe weakest part of the gameplay, for me, was the bossfights. They were interesting, and had cool ideas for blending bossfight mechanics with what you need to type, when you type it and why you type it, but the bossfights, on the highest difficulty, were incredibly easy. I played it a few months after release, so it may have been changed or updated, but I found myself kind of bored by the teamfights in an otherwise challenging and enjoyable experience.\n\nBut, don't let that dissuade you. The game is superfun and absolutely worth picking up. Also, I'd imagine it's incredibly good if you want to learn to type.","February 20, 2015","true","49.1"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","80","8","10","3","0"

Well not everyone is a huge fan of educational games. But this game puts a video game cliche on it and makes it about killing zombies! You love killing zombies don't you?\n\nEven if you're not a huge fan of a zombie game this one can certainly improve your speed AND accuracy as a typer, trust me, nothing gets your fingers typing faster if a zombie is running towards you.\n\nAs one of my friends said "If you can type fast, you'll love this game"\n\n+T-the story?\nWhy, why did I care for the story? This game is basically a mod of House of The Dead but instead you use your keyboard to kill the zombies. But for some reason, I really enjoyed the characters and how they reacted with eachother.\n\n+Not a fan of the typing aspect? No problem!\nI only tried for the first level of this because I only really bought this game for the typing, but if you don't enjoy the typing aspect you can always try out the PS3 port of House of The Dead where it becomes an on-rails shooter instead.\n\nCONS\n\n-Short, Like. Really short.\nSo this game has a total average playtime of 4 hours with 7 hours if you're a completionist. That's not that great, while I did enjoy the short and sweet storyline, that doesn't mean I don't want more action. Even so, you can team up with a friend for multiplayer or try out the minigames.\n\n-Somewhat, easy.\nSo I suck at Video Games and according to my friend, I even suck at typing. but even at the normal difficulty I was able to plow through zombie with easy. I guess that's why hardcore mode exists. (Seriously though, hardcore mode 2hard4me.)\n\n-Broken mechanics?\nAs I was playing I started to notice quite a few bugs. for one theres a lot of the sound effects and dialogue being cut for no reason, it wasn't even in the middle of a cutscene. Also I noticed while typing to kill you didn't actually need to press the space key when it was two words, I looked over it and still pressed space but that does feel a bit cheap.\n\nFinal Notes and Score\n\n-This is probably one of the best typing games out there so if you're looking to improve and have some fun, I suggest purchasing this.\n\n-I haven't tried it, but the DLC looks interesting aswell, making you type like Shakespeare should up the difficulty right?\n\n-If you find this game great, I suggest looking into the older Typing of The Dead series, there really good and even harder.\n\n-Before you go, I leave you with  this masterpiece\n\nFinal Score: 9\n\nSPOILERS AHEAD\n\n-I found the last boss great, I wish they had more gimmicks like that in more of the boss fights\n\n-Why did Varla need to die ;_;\n\n-Clements a Mother-lover","July 6, 2014","true","4.1"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

No? Well now you have the chance!\n\nTyp­ing of the Dead: Overkill is about to make you improve your typ­ing skills with­out any fuss or wor­ries! Hordes of undead come at you with words high­lighted under­neath them, which you must then type as quickly as pos­si­ble in order to kill them. Each let­ter you type cor­re­sponds to a sin­gle gun­shot, but unfor­tu­nately there are no head­shot here, so you will have to type the whole word or words in order to kill the zombies!\n\nThe story of the game does not really have any­thing to offer, how­ever the funny and obscure dia­logues of the char­ac­ters as well as the con­tin­u­ous action will keep you occu­pied for a cou­ple of hours, which is how long this game is….\n\nOne might think that typ­ing and mov­ing your char­ac­ter at the same time must be dif­fi­cult, how­ever there is no need to worry. The game moves the char­ac­ters on its own, in a scripted fash­ion, there­fore allow­ing you to con­cen­trate on the mat­ter at hand! Killing them zombies!\n\nThe game is sep­a­rated into acts, each one of them con­clud­ing with a boss fight, where things do get trick­ier. Typ­ing words at the cor­rect moment is what does the trick here, plus you’ll have to avoid pro­jec­tiles which will hit you unless you type a spe­cific let­ter very fast. Not too much of a vari­ety, but it’s still fun.\n\nGraph­ics and sound resem­ble a game which has been pro­duced in the last decade (this is a Wii port after all), how­ever the nar­ra­tor does an excel­lent job of push­ing the story for­ward, while the voice overs, even though they lack in finesse, are so funny and insult­ing at times, that it is actu­ally a blast play­ing this game. The sounds from the guns do get repet­i­tive, as most of the time a hand gun is all you have at your dis­posal, and it some­times can­not even be heard as its sound is cov­ered by the voice overs, let­ting you won­der whether you are pulling the trig­ger or not.\n\nThis is not a game that will keep you occu­pied for long, and its replaya­bil­ity is ques­tion­able. The only rea­son for you to want to go back is either to improve your high score, or find all the col­lectibles which are scat­tered through­out the act.\n\nWith that being said, the Typ­ing of the Dead:Overkill is not a bad game. It is actu­ally a dif­fer­ent and fun game, and it does have its moments. Zom­bie lov­ing gamers should give it a go, as it resem­bles a cult B-movie where you can take part and expe­ri­ence some zom­bie killing which is quite dif­fer­ent from what we’re used to in the cur­rent days.\n\nRead more reviews at: http://www.blowsomesteam.com/the-typing-of-the-dead-overkill/","December 23, 2014","true","2.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

I have become a faster and more accurate typer because of this game. Not only does the game give you Typing of the Dead(based off of the Wii version of HotD:O), but it also gives you House of the Dead: Director's Cut(based off of the PS3 version). Both of the game's modes can be played in singleplayer, or in online multiplayer. There are also 3 mini-games for each of the game's modes, that can be played in singleplayer or online multiplayer. The netcode is great, and is fully playable with people who are 1,000+ kms(621.4+ miles) away.\n\nAll the DLC dictionary wordlists can be active at the same time, expanding the total wordpool and adding more variety/replayability. There are also settings for how often you want to see the DLC words being used while playing. The developers have been great with the DLC, so far there have been 3 free DLCs, along with 5 paid DLCs. The free DLCs are of the same quality as the paid DLC, so if you are interested in what the paid DLC is like, then be sure to try the DLC that is already included in your game. *As of July 2014*\n\nNOTE 1: There is no language filter for this game. So parents may not want to use this game as a teaching aid for younger children, unless you are willing to let your children hear a lot of cursing. Personally, I do not have a problem with letting children hear cursing(especially in a game full of gore and killing), but it is definitely a deciding factor for some parents. If you are one of those parents, make sure you are using Steam's Parental Controls to prevent your children from playing this game. The original Typing of the Dead is a great option for these parents(although it is not on Steam).\n\nNOTE 2: Local Multiplayer will not be implemented into the game. While theoretically possible, there is a great challenge in having a PC differentiate between 2 or more keyboards at the same time. While it is not impossible to implement, it was never part of the original plan for the game. So unless you are willing to fund this feature yourself(better get a Kickstarter going as game development is not cheap), do not continue to create topics asking for this feature on the Steam/SEGA forums. The developers are aware of the fan desire for this feature, and are looking into it for future games.","July 9, 2014","true","6.5"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

There's a story here, but you won't be paying much attention to it because your eyes will be jumping around in a constant frenzy between screen and keyboard. The graphics are okay-ish, there's a lot of swearing (thank God, because I do hate narrow-minded political correctness), and the script comes straight out one of those Grind movies from the eighties (or seventies, not sure).\n\nGameplay feels great - provided you like typing, that is. If you don't, there's no point in getting this title, is there? The words are thrown at you in a way designed to keep you on your toes, and most of them are quite funny and there are keywords/catch phrases from other games, movies and TV shows. These will bring a smile to your lips when you spot them for what they are. And there are times when it really feels like you are shooting a gun instead of typing on your keyboard.\n\nEach level (story chapter) ends with a boss fight. Bosses are creative, but you defeat them always in the same manner (you've guessed it, more typing).\n\nYou can fiddle with the options to adjust your typing response time, but I think that even the lowest setting won't help you much if you only type with two fingers. Finger dexterity is a requirement here. Or not, since story mode gives you unlimited lives.\n\nThere are some other game types besides story mode, but I haven't explored those and can't really comment on them.\n\nTo sum it all up, get this game if:\n>you really like typing;\n>you like zombies;\n>you are not easily offended by violence and/or swear words;\n>it's on sale.","September 18, 2014","true","8.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

What few run-ins I had with the game were care of friends whom I didn't see terribly often, and stock of the Dreamcast keyboard dried up before I could afford to track one down. At least we still had arcades around the same time, and I had fed plenty of quarters into many a House of the Dead cabinet up to that point.\n\nWhen House of the Dead: Overkill came along, I got a chuckle out of the idea of an over-the-top successor to the series, but it didn't really grab my attention. But add typing into the mix, giving me the chance to make up for missing the original? Sold.\n\nThe updates from House of the Dead's general goofiness to an even more ridiculous grindhouse motif, complete with the latter's ridiculous gore and doubling down on vulgarity, somehow make sense in a game whose predecessors were known for monster outbreaks for no good reason in an inexplicable location. And things are so off-the-wall already that working the typewriters into things makes just as much sense. Unfortunately, unlike the original Typing of the Dead, the use of a keyboard as a weapon isn't as integrated into Overkill's story or cutscenees. Characters still wave around the same guns they use in the regular gameplay, rather than sporting backpacks with keyboards looped in front of their bodies as per the original. A mild difference, and one that would've made many of the action-loaded cutscenes even more difficult to pull off had they stuck with it.\n\nThat aside, the game is fantastic. The vocabulary necessary to progress ramps up at a perfect pace, though it feels like it plateaus a few levels too early. Boss fights and some of the segues between sections are creative, and keep mixing things up as much as you can for what's basically Mavis Beacon Goes Through Hell. It's also nice that there are several DLC packs available with new lexicons, should you find a certain vernacular more familiar and therefore a bit easier to keep up with. The little bonuses you get for snagging collectables in each level are cute, too.\n\nIt's a bit gross in some respects, but that's part of the whole grindhouse aesthetic. If you're not into that, you're not going to be into this, but otherwise? Have a good time.","January 11","true","10.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Honestly it's dull. Nothing about it is funny or worth paying attention to.\n\nOn the otherhand, it has some new qualities not included in the original (well duh). There's 3 minigames you can play, multiplayer, and a "new" switch mode that allows you to play Typing of the Dead: Overkill as House of the Dead: Overkill. Instead of typing, you can use your mouse as the gun like an arcade railgun shooter.

It looks bad, the gameplay is bad, and the typing is quite bad. In some quick time events, there would be enormous phrases that is impossible to do even at the highest difficulty (which I play at). I cannot recommend this game in good conscious because it's such a let down.\n\nEdit: I have just finished the game so this needs another update. After a while, words and phrases are noticably repeating. I don't even understand how that could be a problem given how many combinations there could be. I have yet to see any of the words in the screenshots on the store page too. The House of the Dead version of the game is nearly impossible, heck, it IS impossible to beat. The zom-mutants move too fast for the mouse. Also you simply cannot make a combo unless you aim perfectly at the body every time. It's a broken port.\n\nAs a little cheat-"glitch"(?) for the last boss: You can just type anything to kill her. Spam letters because it doesn't actually gauge your words (not that they even tell you how to kill her anyways).  Refer to this screenshot.\n\nObligatory score: 4/10","March 16, 2014","false","4.1"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","9","15","0","0"

There are an incredible amount of graphical and audio glitches, such as music cutting out and not repeating; characters' lines cutting out mid-sentence or just not saying them altogether; preset animations clipping through the environment or through characters; etc.\n\nPlus, a lot of depth from the original game has been stripped; there are no different weapons, and bosses no longer really require skill other than typing speed. I was left feeling like I had missed a lot of interesting gameplay elements from the original game.\n\nPlus, as to be expected, playing the actual House of the Dead game rather than the Typing of the Dead version is completely worthless. It has all the depth that was stripped out of Typing of the Dead, but since it's controlled with your mouse rather than a light gun, it becomes sluggish and unfun to play.\n\nA good game in concept, especially considering the popularity of the original Typing of the Dead, but the poor optimization and lazy stripping of depth really kills what could have made this game a worthy sequel.","November 25, 2013","false","4.1"," 35 of 66 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","35","66","0","0"

The entire game has a gridnhouse, Z movie, vibe to it with a story that's intentionally stupid, chockfull of F-bombs with exagerated gore and hilariously ridiculous plot twists.\n\nThere is a good ammount of replay value as well, playing the Typing mode on the Agent(normal) difficulty already proves a challenge and gradually stepping it up to the Motherf**ker (Hard) difficulty with hardcore mode turned on is a whole other challenge altogether. I haven't tried the DLC dictionaries but they should also add a new layer of difficulty to an already challenging game.\n\nIf there are a comple of downsides. One, is that the bosses often have a very unforgiving timing to counter their attacks or that the final boss just didn't feel very well polished. Two, is that the leaderboards are often hacked, so even if you'd like to try to make it to the top-scores the hackers just ruin it for everyone.\n\nTo sum it up, like it's predecessor, it's still an unique game, I've yet to see any other games to take this aproach to on-rails shooters and it still is a very fun experience, no mention that playing enough of this game might even improve your 'motherf**king' typing skills.","January 11, 2014","true","18.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Suprisng amount of depth in threat-management.\n\nThe only *real* downside to all this is the lack of goofy dreamcasts and keyboards strapped to the player characters a-la the original typing of the dead.\n\nDefinitely get this.

Much like the original, this game is a re-working of the original release of House of the Dead: Overkill which replaces aiming cursors to deal with foes with typing strings of words to dispatch them instead. The feeling of typing often-hilarious combinations of words and phrases to lay waste to everything on screen is still a very satisfying feeling, but not-so-great typists may want to be wary that the difficulty curve isn't quite as gentle as the original Typing of the Dead. Overkill is much less a learning to type aid and definitely more for those of us that are a bit more competent with the keyboard.\n\nThis game also includes the extended cut of House of the Dead: Overkill, which can be played as an on-rails shooter with a gamepad or mouse. Though this is the way the game was originally released, it's fairly bland compared to the Typing of the Dead version, and in no way holds up to any of the previous House of the Dead games. Enemy variety is sparse, the combo-driven scoring system is a chore to manage, boss fights have almost no creativity or gimmicks worth noting, and the weapon upgrade system never really feels all that significant. It's nice that this version of the game comes included as opposed to being sold as DLC, but the overall ho-hum presentation and lack of variety really makes clicking through hordes of mutants an exercise in tedium as opposed to a fun arcadey experience.\n\nTyping of the Dead: Overkill is definitely a game worth checking out, but maybe not at full price. Trail-blazing a path of carnage through seemingly endless hordes of mutants with just your keyboard is definitely exciting, but the lack of any real variety and the ham-fisted grindhouse trappings wear thin only a few stages in and you may be done with the game long before it's done with you.","April 18, 2014","true","5.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/widgetguy/recommended/246580/","widgetguy","widgetguy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/widgetguy/","975 products in account","Typing of The Dead Overkill (TOTD) is an HD remake of House of the Dead 2 (HOTD2), an arcade “rail shooter.”  I never played the original (which came out over 15 years ago) so I can’t tell you how closely it follows the original story. I can’t imagine it’s too closely though since Typing of the Dead Overkill is filled with profanity/nudity.\n\nThe original HOTD2 was a basic rail shooter where you have no control of movement, you just point and click at any zombies that pop up on the screen. TOTD is similar, except that instead of using the mouse to point and click, a random word will pop up on the screen over an enemy's head and you need to type it into the keyboard as fast as you can (otherwise the zombie will bite you). For example, you’re moving down the hall and two zombies shamble into view from one of the doors. Above each zombie’s head is a word, such as KILL or DEATH. If you type the word in correctly, the zombie gets “shot” and dies. If the zombie runs in from far away you might have to type in a longer word, and if an enemy throws a knife at you, you might just have to hit one key to deflect it. It can get pretty hairy when half a dozen zombies crawl out and you need to pick which word to type first (kill the closest zombie first!) Each level has a boss at the end, often with some special way to kill them.\n\nStorywise, every level has a prologue and epilogue along with a bunch of wisecracks during the missions. You play one of 2 cops who are chasing a madman who released a zombie virus. On alternating levels, you play one of 2 strippers who are also chasing the same bad guy. By the way, like the arcade the game is made for 2 players, though I haven’t tried multi-player. The environments are varied and so are the enemies, but the variety is really just for visuals since you kill everyone the same way (type the word over their head).\n\nIn addition to the TOTD campaign, the original HOTD2 game is included with updated graphics. It’s basically the exact same game except you use the mouse to point and shoot enemies. Using the mouse is actually a lot harder since you actually need to aim at some smaller enemies (evil crows!) and shoot bosses in their weak spots.\n\nPros:\n+Learn to type random words fast like your life (points) depend on it!\n+An over the top story that would never fly in a movie, unless it was a Grindhouse film. Can be funny at times.\n+House of the Dead 2 included. (Point and click version of the game).\n+Scary and gruesome at times. We’re talking zombies and monsters after all.\n\nCons:\n-Kind of short, maybe 5-6 hours.\n-The point & click version can be VERY hard. You have to aim at the knives that get thrown at you or the mutant babies charging at you. I played through easy mode and couldn’t get through a level without being hit.\n\nYou might think that with all the typing you’d be a typing expert by the end of the game, but alas I still have to look at my hands when I type some of the words. This might be because you’re only typing in random words instead of complete sentences.  Overall I’m glad I bought the game (Humble Bundle BTA) and would recommend it to anyone who likes rail shooters or zombie games.\n","September 2, 2014","true","6.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I find them really repetitive and they're just the same thing over and over. However, with Typing of the Dead, there are different mechanics that I'm not used to using, like the whole keyboard for example. Even though the plot of the game is pretty thin, it doesn't take itself seriously, and it's pretty entertaining.  I like that it challenges me to type as fast as I can, and there are so many different dictionaries to download, which makes the phrases vary even more than they already do. My only real complaint about this game is that a lot of the achievements are really grindy. You have to play the same levels over and over again, which can get tedious when you marathon games like I do. I've played this game for 8 hours over the past 3 days, so I'm kind of sick of playin the same levels over and over. Even the thrill of getting another achievement has started wearing off. I'll just have to come back to it later to finish it off.\n\nBasically, it's an awesome, fun game, and it'll challenge your skills when it comes to touch-typing. It gets repetitive, but as long as you don't marathon it like I did, it should be okay. It's definitely worth buying if you want to improve your typing skills and/or if you like zombie games.\n\n","June 3, 2015","true","10.3"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Sometimes videos won't show (I'll get audio but no visual feedback), the cursor will never show in pre-game menus, the same menus won't allow me to use my keyboard. (weren't we in a typing game?)\n\nIt's aesthetic is as uninspired as it gets, and graphics are pretty bad for a 2013 game.\n\nUnfortunately, it doesn't shine as a typing game to make up for that.\nWhile it seems to be competently unforgiving of typing errors (you'll almost always get hit in return), it is plagued by questionable decisions: the games ignores all spaces, doesn't differentiate between upper and lower case, and won't make you remove typing error with backspace before letting you continue, making the gameplay a spam and pray one.\nOn top of that, the game doesn't give you intuitive feedback on threat priorities, forcing you into fail and retry for some scenes. (civilians to save, boss fights)\n\nThis brings me to another characteristic of the game: it is a railroad shooter, you'll always get the exact same experience (same dialogs and same camera movements), and I was already sick of it 2 minutes into restarting the first level.\n\nYou may consider the writing and humor of the game to be a redeeming factor, but it is hit or miss at best.\nAs you may surmise, it was a huge miss with me, getting only one genuine laugh out of me in what was otherwise an ocean of bad jokes in a generic z-movie zom... mutant plot.\n\nTL;DR: probably not worth the $20 price tag.

Somehow, this one misses the mark in two important ways.\n\n1. The cutscenes in the original TOTD weren't supposed to be funny. Overkill clearly is, but the contrast between the allegedly serious (if badly executed) House of the Dead 2 and killing them with keyboards is funnier than when the game is already trying to be funny.\n\n2. Far more crucially, in the original TOTD, the words were completely random. In Overkill, the words seem to be joing about the circumstances. Early playthroughs of the first level would give lots of words about horror movies. The boss characters  even less random. I failed against a mutated cheerleader boss. Starting the battle again, I was getting the same words, all cracks at the mutant cheerleader's weight. I personally think the massive library of phrases the original would dispense randomly was far funnier and less boring to play.\n\nThese probably sound like nitpicks, but they sapped my enjoyment of the game.

It peaked at No.2 or No.3 on my wishlist ... and so I was even more disappointed by the game's end result.\n\nOrigins\nThis game is basically the spiritual successor to The Typing of the Dead, which was a modification of the original House of the Dead such that you killed by typing words rather than shooting a laser gun. (How cool is that!)\n\nIn this case, the original source material is House of the Dead: Overkill, which received relatively positive reviews years ago, in part due to its stylistic integration of cheesy B-movie film genre and the House of the Dead game franchise.\n\nStory, characters, etc\nI don't think anyone plays any House of the Dead games for the plot or characters or anything, but still. The execution couldn't even rate as a neutral factor here, sadly.\n\nI don't think I've ever actually watched a cheesy B-movie film before, and so the style and humor was amusing ... at first. If there were ever an example of beating a dead horse, this game is full of it. Excessive cussing. Lame dialogue. Annoying characters. And voices that make your ears bleed. By the end, all the long cut scenes were a real chore to get through. The cut scenes are skippable, but I generally prefer to watch everything through the first (and in this case final) time.\n\nGame play\nAs each zombie approaches you, an associated word box will pop up onto the screen. If the zombies are close enough to strike you, the word box will flash. Pretty straightforward. To kill the zombies, you must type the shown word or phrase.\n\nMy one complaint is that there are times when there are multiple zombies approaching, and it can be difficult to figure out which word box represents the closer zombie, which can result in unnecessary hits.\n\nIf you want to switch to another word box or zombie, I think there's a button that will cancel your progress in the present word box that is faster than just backspacing and typing the other phrase, but I can't remember it off the top of my head.\n\nThere are special power-ups, health replenishment or collectibles throughout. If you see them on the screen, hit Tab and they will be automatically collected.\n\nCollectibles\nI'm not an achievements ♥♥♥♥♥, but collecting things in this game is so easy because of the linear nature of the game that there's no point NOT making the effort. But the layout to view your collectibles is so horrible. There's no grid ... you literally have to cycle through everything, one by one, and then you have to click on it to see what it actually is. Hugely inefficient.\n\nReplayability\nThe mini games are a complete waste of time. I can't see anyone enjoying them enough to play them. Only completionists would bother.\n\nThis might be more fun to play in multiplayer, but just getting through the single player campaign completely wiped me to the point where I had zero interest in playing this again.\n\nAdding theoretical value is the inclusion of the original House of the Dead: Overkill. However, I didn't play it, so I couldn't tell you whether it's any good.\n\nOverall rating: 5/10. It was fun at first, garnering maybe a 7/10 ... but a few levels in, everything is so repetitive and annoying that the game ends up being quite the unpleasant experience overall.","May 25, 2014","false","6.2"," 18 of 34 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","18","34","0","0"

I also owned and played through overkill on wii. I've played the first two typing of the dead games as well.\n\nThe original House of the Dead series had lovably bad dialog, but it was in a terribly voice acted way - not just crappily written trying to be funny 'grindhouse' sexist trash kind of plot way. In the overkill spinoffs, the constant misogyny almost overwhelms the bad puns (which I'd normally enjoy.) This game feels distinctly american while the original house of the dead games felt very 'sega', if that makes sense.\n\nBut in addition to dated graphics (we're talking about a wii game here, you know) there's a ton of issues like things popping in (and models outright being seethrough, resulting in legs and arms without the rest of the zombie) and ♥♥♥♥♥♥ continuity (a character has their glasses dramatically smacked off only to have them on their face in the next shot). It's pretty sloppy.\n\nAnyway, that being said this is the only typing to kill zombies game on steam and it scratches an itch I've had since the first typing of the dead came out. There's nothing quite like it and I'll probably play it all the way through and go back again at times. The typing part is well done, solid mechanics. Overall the game is pretty fun, if you can ignore the infantile plot and design. So, I suppose, thumbs up on this review.\n\nIt also includes the 'normal' version of the game but frankly it's in no way worth playing without a lightgun - mouse or controller just don't cut it.","June 27, 2014","true","1.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The humour is the same, incredibly satire and tongue-in-cheek, making jokes at itself and the situation, that situation being typing to kill zombies.\n\nSo, let's talk about the game itself, as a typing game. It's pretty good.\n\nThe strongest parts of the games are the "progression" through levels, killing zombies, picking up powerups, and unlocking unlockable all using rapidly typed words on screen. The difficult has different modes, and as someone who has tested with 120+wpm, I found the extreme difficulty to be the perfect level for what I was expecting.\n\nThe weakest part of the gameplay, for me, was the bossfights. They were interesting, and had cool ideas for blending bossfight mechanics with what you need to type, when you type it and why you type it, but the bossfights, on the highest difficulty, were incredibly easy. I played it a few months after release, so it may have been changed or updated, but I found myself kind of bored by the teamfights in an otherwise challenging and enjoyable experience.\n\nBut, don't let that dissuade you. The game is superfun and absolutely worth picking up.

Not only has it helped my typing skills, it's also hilarious and extremely fun. I haven't played for very much time yet, but I see a lot of replay value in it due to me being a scoremonger. There's also plenty of collectables and such throughout the levels, so that also adds replay value.\n\nOverall, I'd say buy it, though maybe wait for a sale as $20 is a bit steep for the amount of content there appears to be.

I would highly reccommend it especially since it is not just Typing of the Dead but also House of the Dead Overkill Directors Cut, and for £15.00 that is a steal! For those interested I will run down some aspects I liked and didn't like.\n\nPros\nDifficulties aren't just determined by how long the word is but uses genuinely complicated words.\nVery vulgar and offensive, some would say sometimes it goes abit far but personally I wasn't too phased by this.\nTwo Games in one!\nGrindhouse feel, from the voiceover to the levels put across as movies this is incredibly entertaining in my view.\nSteam Workshop support.\nRankings are used, not much of a selling point for some but it is always fun trying to go back and get a perfect score to achieve S ranking.\nThe Online Co-op is now fully functional! Abit of healthy competition between friends never goes a miss.\nThe game has a relatively good sense of humor in my opinion.\nCons\nThe story is all over the place and very bare bones.\nThe Typing of the Dead game just isn't the same without Lightguns/ Wii Remote/ Move Controller.\nUnlike the original Typing of the Dead, G and Washington use guns rather than keyboards (not a huge problem but abit disappointing)\nThe game doesn't care about spaces or punctatuation. (outside of the Pro variant that is only unlocked after completion)\nThe DLC dictionaries don't really stick to the difficulty you have set, it will put words way beyond a newbies skill level even on easy.\nOnly the House of the Dead Overkill is Directors Cut, for whatever reason Typing is just the base game we saw released on Wii in 2009.\nGraphics aren't much to look at.\nSometimes when skipping cutscenes there is mild freezing that will stop in a few seconds but is relatively irratating none the less.\nSo considering the numerous cons I have toward the game why am I recommending the game? Because it is fun, granted it isn't a technical masterpeice and it's graphics don't even surpass those of previous House of the Dead Games (3 onwards) but it is enjoyable to play and in the end it can even be educational. (If only to an extent due to the vulgarity!)\nI would say, if the list of cons has really put you off the game then wait until it is on a deep discount.","April 11, 2015","true","16.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You'll likely have a chuckle or two at the words and phrases you type, usually relating to the situation you're in or sometimes due to the random dictionary getting a humourous set of words in a sequence.\n\nThat said, it's nothing to go rush out for. I picked this up in a sale and I enjoy it a lot but I'd probably pass at the recommended price. I like zombie games and I like typing but I'm pretty stingy.\n\nFor an added bonus, you can also play all the chapters of the game in old-school point'n'click shooting mode too - but the charm is lost without a light gun.","March 29, 2015","true","2.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"

Terrible writing and story, makes you think that Sega took a break from working on the story from the others and decided to let a group of junior high students write it...\n\n...and I hate to say it but... I love it...\n\nNow compared to the classic House of the Dead 2, Overkill is gutter trash. However it still lives up to House of the Dead goodness. There is two ways to play, as you guessed by the title of it on the store page. Type to kill, or play it the same way the PC House of the Dead's played. The typing game mode is simple enough, you type each word that comes up on screen and move on to the next. It's the norm gamemode (that being normal house of the dead, aim, shoot, kill) that the fun lies. Both are enjoyable, but at best, you really just want to play it the way it was meant to be played. Despite that, the typing is nice when you want to take a break from aiming, it also doubles as typing practice for those who arent the fastest typers.\n\nScore: 8/10 - It's House of the Dead on the PC, nothing more, nothing less. With two ways to play, so think two games in one. Best to get it on sale, however the full price wouldnt be bad to pay either.\n\nReplay Value: High - Each stage has collectibles to obtain, and its always nice to tackle a completed stage with a different weapon. The collectibles, different difficulties, two ways to play, and small but satisfying choice of weapons. A good time killer, and it's always nice going for a higher score than your previous best.","December 17, 2013","true","22.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The stereotypes are pushed so hard, and cursing so overdone, that it's almost embarrassing to watch. I can't really comment on the visuals during the game - you'll be so busy typing that you barely notice.\n\nIf you've played the original Typing of the Dead, this is a bit of a step backwards in some ways.

The character animation (in cutscenes) and mouth/lip animations are really bad. The story, such as it is, is strange.

Absolutely awesome game. Aside of that it will test your typing skills, it has quite funny but little over the top storyline.

Albini","http://steamcommunity.com/id/wickedsushi/","238 products in account","If you want something fresh, something different from your everyday COD-copy shooter, you should check this title out.\n\nThe typing mechanics can be intense, there are a variety of levels from a carnival to a swamp, an onslaught of unluckables, various weapon upgrades, multiple difficulty levels, and so forth. The original version of the game is also included, which you can play with the mouse. While not as much fun as typing away mutants, it is fun in its own way and totally makes it worth doing a second or third run through the story.\n\nThought I would be turned off by all the over-the-top expletives others have complained about, but it never actually bothered me nor distracted me. In fact, I would say some of the narrator dialog is really well-written. Many of the words you need to type not only change depending on the level you are on, but are also either amusingly dark, subtle references ("A Rita Hayworth Poster" during a prison level), or cleaver puns.\n\nKeep in mind that this is an arcade shooter. If you can already type fast, hardcore mode won't be so hardcore, ergo won't take long to complete. I would say if you're only interested in the typing mode and beating it just once, you can see everything in about two hours. Personally, I'm planning on unlocking all the achievements and so estimating I will get a good eight to ten fun hours out of this.\n\nIt's worth paying the admission price for such a unique gaming experience.","January 11, 2014","true","6.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The stereotypes are pushed so hard, and cursing so overdone, that it's almost embarrassing to watch. I can't really comment on the visuals during the game - you'll be so busy typing that you barely notice.\n\nIf you've played the original Typing of the Dead, this is a bit of a step backwards in some ways. While it's possibly a bit more polished, the original included more variation in gameplay and several additional minigames and training exercises that are obviously missing here.

The Typing of the Dead: Overkill replaces guns with words and phrases, some of which are completely random.  Be aware that the dictionary is set to UK by default, but you can set it to US.  Otherwise, you'll be typing "honour" and "pyjamas".  Thrown items are deflected with a single letter, and if you're in the middle of a phrase when you see it, hit Backspace to abort the phrase and switch priorities.  However, my typing skills must not be that good for Normal, considering I die at least once on every level.  You can't collect health packs (or any collectibles) either, unless there's a method I'm not aware of, which makes things harder.  Be prepared, there's a twist for the final boss too.\n\nWhen you're done killing enemies with your words, you can switch over to the original House of the Dead: Overkill, where you can upgrade weapons and collect stuff by shooting at them, but be aware that reloading can open a window for your enemies to attack you.  Completing HotD: O will unlock the Director's Cut mode, which gives longer levels with more enemies that rush at you (also, have fun with the middle of Ballstic Trauma).  The Director's Cut is not available for Typing.  Also worth mentioning that Typing and House both have levels not present in the Wii version.  They both star Varla Guns and Candi Stryper.  Level 2 is Naked Terror (between Papa's Palace of Pain and Ballistic Terror), and Level 5 is The Creeping Flesh (between Carny and The Fetid Waters).\n\nThe game does have its issues.  Models do pop in and pop out.  There are sound issues where all the sound effects will stop in order for a character to speak, and during Carny, you can't hear any sounds or voices when beating a Rage mutant with a hammer.  Also, this is a grindhouse/exploitation-style game, so bear in mind this game did get the Guiness World Record for the most uses of the f-word, and there's violence galore (granted, this is a game involving shooting zom-err, mutants), so keep the kids away from this one, lest they start talking like Detective Washington.","March 19, 2014","true","11.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/antzako/recommended/246580/","antzako","Anathon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/antzako/","130 products in account","This game's a hard one to decide whether to recommend it or not and LET ME TELL YOU WHY.\nLet's start with the good things. The soundtrack's stupidly great, with some funny songs in the main menu and catchy tunes in levels. The gameplay which consists of just what the title says, is well made and it too, has some funny words and sentences. The cutscenes have their funny parts and it doesn't take itself seriously at all, which is a nice thing to see in a zomb-mutant game. And for some reason it just doesn't get old. You'd think that this simple idea of just typing would get boring after an hour, but for some reason it just doesn't.\nNow, on to the bad things about this game. This game feels unpolished, like a beta game of sorts. The most reoccurring bug I've had has to do with the audio. The soundeffects cut out, the dialogue cuts out and the soundtrack cuts out. These fortunatelly don't happen in cutscenes, but they make certain scenes seem really awful as they have no soundeffects. If you type while looking at your keyboard, the soundeffects cutting out can screw you over as you don't hear when you screw a word up.\nAlso the game is missing a thing that every game should have: a restart button. Oh yes, if you want  or need to restart you have to:quit to main menu, watch a loading screen, select the mission, watch a loading screen, skip a cutscene and watch a loading screen. Also the loading screens take way too long for a game made in 2013. The restarting progress takes roughly 40 seconds, which is unbearable if you plan on playing on hard or hardcore later, as the game isn't easy. It just gets way too frustrating playing on hard if you aren't some sort of master typer.\nOverall this game's good if you aren't planning on playing hard.\n5/10 if you're planning on playing on hard and 7/10 if you're planning on playing on normal / easy, which rounds up to 6/10 BUT ONLY BUY IT IF IT'S ON SALE","January 3, 2014","true","4.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Typing out "okey dokey doctor jones" while fending of a horde of zombies is a great feeling. However I must compare this to the previous Typing of the dead game.\n\nMuch of the uniqueness of the first game are not present here.  The boss fights are poorly suited for typing in this game.  Gone are the sentence drills or answer a question fights of the first game. The boss fights are not much different from the regular zombies of just typing the word(s) before they attack. Another problem I feel with the game is that  it is too easy. Disclaimer: only ran through once on normal mode. Throughout the game the difficulty between levels was not noticable. On the last level I was still getting words that were 5 characters long. Maybe there were some marginally longer sentences to type out but i would not say it was significant increase in difficulty. Compared to the first game, the difficulty was very noticable with some zombies having very long words to type out. Also in the first game, when you die the difficulty changes dynamically. The difficulty in this game is not dynamic compared to the first. The game also has some general buggy-ness. I had to restart once because when I finished typing out a zombies string, it disappered yet the zombie was still there rendering it impossible to me to beat him. Also the audio cut out many times when I had to face rage zombies. Probably the biggest knock I have for the game is that I came across  repeated phrases in a single level  (occured multiple times). I have never seen this happen in the previous game but there should be no reason I see the phrase Killing Twins twice in one level.  This too happened with the DLC I bought . I believe the dlc is much much smaller than i expected it to be.\n\nAs many problems the game has, it just dumb and fun. Not many other games you can type and kill zombies. Buy it when it goes on sale. Or torrent the superior previous one. I highly recommend the latter.","January 12, 2014","true","8.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Albini","http://steamcommunity.com/id/wickedsushi/","238 products in account","If you want something fresh, something different from your everyday COD-copy shooter, you should check this title out.\n\nThe typing mechanics can be intense, there are a variety of levels from a carnival to a swamp, an onslaught of unluckables, various weapon upgrades, multiple difficulty levels, and so forth. The original version of the game is also included, which you can play with the mouse. While not as much fun as typing away mutants, it is fun in its own way and totally makes it worth doing a second or third run through the story.\n\nThought I would be turned off by all the over-the-top expletives others have complained about, but it never actually bothered me nor distracted me. In fact, I would say some of the narrator dialog is really well-written. Many of the words you need to type not only change depending on the level you are on, but are also either amusingly dark, subtle references ("A Rita Hayworth Poster" during a prison level), or cleaver puns.\n\nKeep in mind that this is an arcade shooter. If you can already type fast, hardcore mode won't be so hardcore, ergo won't take long to complete. I would say if you're only interested in the typing mode and beating it just once, you can see everything in about two hours. Personally, I'm planning on unlocking all the achievements and so estimating I will get a good eight to ten fun hours out of this.\n\nIt's worth paying the admission price for such a unique gaming experience.","January 11, 2014","true","6.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Count me in. :)\n\nThis game isn't as good as the old Dreamcast one but it sure is enjoyable at small doses. You play as the 2 most out of place characters in the universe (and 2 chicks that are even more out of place) on a storyline that's good/bad enough to be the plot of some B-movie from the 70's.\n\nThe gameplay is addictive, although it gets pretty repetitive after some time, the graphics are really dated by nowdays standards, the controls are what you would expect from a title like this and the replayability is pretty high, since all the words are randomized and you can aim for a better rank/score.\n\nI don't think it's worth it's full price if you're not a fan of the franchise since it's a game that you would play only on small dosis, but expect those small dosis to be fun and franctic. But if you are a fan, buy this game now: You probably won't regret it.\n\nIf you need a score, I'll give this game a 7/10. It's not as memorable as the first one in the franchise nor it does something different than putting words to type on HOTD: Overkill, but since it comes with it as well, it counts as a good bonus for an already above average game.","November 25, 2013","true","6.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's a typing tutor by way of a Robert Rodriguez movie, relying on your mad (you hope) typing skillz to destroy a horde of "don't use the 'z' word" mutants coming at you from every angle. The game is  cheesy and hilarious and a hell of a lot of fun.\n\nI picked up the original House of the Dead Overkill PS3 port a few years ago but I didn't get past the third level because, well, mostly because I'm terrible at console shooters, even using the Move as a lightgun-substitute (which, in theory, is easier). The original House of the Dead series of games were light-gun rail shooters and while I enjoyed the story I couldn't get very far in the game due to the mechanics (or my lack of ability, depending on how you choose to look at it). Modern Dream modified the input scheme to rely on accurately-typed words, phrases, and single letters in lieu of wielding firearms to put down this undead uprising. It's not really a typing tutor in any real sense, but if you're pretty good at typing with celerity and accuracy then you will do well.\n\nThe PC release includes the original game as well, if you're terrible at typing or if you prefer FPS mechanics. The House of the Dead levels include a gun shop that allows you to spend money you earn by completing levels (and shooting stacks of cash that you see) on upgrades to your weapons and new boomsticks. While the HotD version of the game is essentially identical to the PS3/Wii version, it's much easier to aim with a mouse-and-keyboard.\n\nAs I said earlier, the story is presented with a grindhouse aesthetic, including cutscenes with film grain, gratuitous nudity, gore, and intense violence. Detective Washington and Agent G are out to stop crime lord and part-time mutant maker Papa Caesar, aided by the angry and vindictive Varla Guns and the dumb-as-a-post but sweet Candi Stryper. The dialogue is ridiculous, the characters are over-the-top, and the setting is somewhere in "Bayou County" (i.e., south Louisiana). The tale unfolds over nine chapters where the two agents or their stripper colleagues battle mutants in settings that range from a swamp to a prison to a circus. As you play, you can shoot (or hit TAB) to collect memorabilia, including pages from the Prelude to an Overkill comic, concept art, 3D models, and audio tracks from the soundtrack.\n\nOh, the soundtrack. I'm listening to it now as I type this review. It's hilarious, toe-tapping, and occasionally a bit disgusting; in other words, it is the perfect aural companion to this game. The tracks are a mix of rockabilly, funk, and metal, interspersed with game dialogue. Sadly it was never officially released by Pitstop Productions or SEGA, but it is available on Grooveshark. An intrepid soul might find a way to download it .\n\nThe game isn't without its issues. Graphically speaking, it's nothing to write home about, although you're basically looking at a 3-year-old console game, so that shouldn't really surprise anyone. It also only runs in a selection of widescreen resolutions so it may or may not run fullscreen on your monitor. Also, the aforementioned memorabilia can be tough to collect a complete set of. Apart from the items available in the standard TotD mode, there is another set of unique collectibles in the House of the Dead mode as well as yet another set in the HotD Director's Cut mode; those require some fast reflexes and/or several playthroughs to get because of the brevity of their onscreen appearances.\n\nThose minor quibbles aside, this is a great, albeit short (probably 6-8 hours to run through the story mode once) experience that is perfect for fans of typing, zombies, and/or faux-grindhouse action. It's not a game-of-the-year contender by any stretch of the imagination, but it is a lot of fun.","January 9, 2014","true","10.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Terrible writing and story, makes you think that Sega took a break from working on the story from the others and decided to let a group of junior high students write it...\n\n...and I hate to say it but... I love it...\n\nNow compared to the classic House of the Dead 2, Overkill is gutter trash. However it still lives up to House of the Dead goodness. There is two ways to play, as you guessed by the title of it on the store page. Type to kill, or play it the same way the PC House of the Dead's played. The typing game mode is simple enough, you type each word that comes up on screen and move on to the next. It's the norm gamemode (that being normal house of the dead, aim, shoot, kill) that the fun lies. Both are enjoyable, but at best, you really just want to play it the way it was meant to be played. Despite that, the typing is nice when you want to take a break from aiming, it also doubles as typing practice for those who arent the fastest typers.\n\nScore: 8/10 - It's House of the Dead on the PC, nothing more, nothing less. With two ways to play, so think two games in one. Best to get it on sale, however the full price wouldnt be bad to pay either.\n\nReplay Value: High - Each stage has collectibles to obtain, and its always nice to tackle a completed stage with a different weapon. The collectibles, different difficulties, two ways to play, and small but satisfying choice of weapons. A good time killer, and it's always nice going for a higher score than your previous best.","December 17, 2013","true","22.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I would highly reccommend it especially since it is not just Typing of the Dead but also House of the Dead Overkill Directors Cut, and for £15.00 that is a steal! For those interested I will run down some aspects I liked and didn't like.\n\nPros\nDifficulties aren't just determined by how long the word is but uses genuinely complicated words.\nVery vulgar and offensive, some would say sometimes it goes abit far but personally I wasn't too phased by this.\nTwo Games in one!\nGrindhouse feel, from the voiceover to the levels put across as movies this is incredibly entertaining in my view.\nSteam Workshop support.\nRankings are used, not much of a selling point for some but it is always fun trying to go back and get a perfect score to achieve S ranking.\nThe Online Co-op is now fully functional! Abit of healthy competition between friends never goes a miss.\nThe game has a relatively good sense of humor in my opinion.\nCons\nThe story is all over the place and very bare bones.\nThe Typing of the Dead game just isn't the same without Lightguns/ Wii Remote/ Move Controller.\nUnlike the original Typing of the Dead, G and Washington use guns rather than keyboards (not a huge problem but abit disappointing)\nThe game doesn't care about spaces or punctatuation. (outside of the Pro variant that is only unlocked after completion)\nThe DLC dictionaries don't really stick to the difficulty you have set, it will put words way beyond a newbies skill level even on easy.\nOnly the House of the Dead Overkill is Directors Cut, for whatever reason Typing is just the base game we saw released on Wii in 2009.\nGraphics aren't much to look at.\nSometimes when skipping cutscenes there is mild freezing that will stop in a few seconds but is relatively irratating none the less.\nSo considering the numerous cons I have toward the game why am I recommending the game? Because it is fun, granted it isn't a technical masterpeice and it's graphics don't even surpass those of previous House of the Dead Games (3 onwards) but it is enjoyable to play and in the end it can even be educational. (If only to an extent due to the vulgarity!)\nI would say, if the list of cons has really put you off the game then wait until it is on a deep discount.","April 11, 2015","true","16.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If you want a Zombie Type-em-up / B-Grade Horror Movie / Reboot of a 2000 Dreamcast game, then this is your only option.\n\nBut it's not a bad option at all. What it does, it does very well, while being very tongue-in-cheek about it.\n\nIf you've ever played any House of the Dead game, then you'll feel right at home. This game is ported from the remake; House of the Dead: Overkill. There's one "key" difference, in that you swap out your light gun for your keyboard. I know, right? I've always thought words were more powerful than weapons.\n\nAs you progress through a level (on the rails), you'll see various zombies ambling their way towards you, accompanied with words or even long phrases. All you gotta do it type a word/phrase at a time to kill the zombies. Easy. But, when they start to pile up on screen, getting ever closer, panic starts to settle in. You can easily be overcome.\n\nNot only that, but you could get distracted by the chuckle-worthy phrases that do pop up. I don't want to shoot a zombie that has the words FREE HUGS under it!\n\nThis game could aim for an educational purpose, helping people to touch-type, if only it wasn't for its non-family-friendly look.\n\nThe Typing of the Dead: Overkill is an overall good game with a unique mechanic. Just don't come looking here for a deep story or compelling drama. Just expect to type words at zombies for a few hours.

I can't say for certain if playing this game will help you in that respect, as it only ever made me realise how bad I was. That doesn't mean it isn't fun, however. The game's ridiculously repugnant story takes you through every cliché in the book as two buddy cops fight their way through a horde of zombies mutants in this 1970's b-movie inspired schlock. The humour probably won't please everyone, so you have to ask yourself if you can enjoy something that's "so bad it's good". The dialogue and voice acting are hammier than Resident Evil, the lip-syncing is practically non-existent, and the story is a mangled mess of tropes and homage. It's not clever or witty, just base and silly. For me, it was a fun time. I beat the "Typing" campaign in under four hours, but with mini games and the House of the Dead mode, you do have something to come back to. If you're looking for a good typing game that evokes 1970's b-movies and light gun shooters, consider picking this up.","May 26, 2014","true","3.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If this sounds up your alley, TOTDO may be worth the price for you. Just don't get your hopes up on the minigames or multiplayer keeping your interest after the main campaign.. at best, the inclusion of the original game with mouse shooting controls might be fun.

But ok, so this game is a great game where you have to gameplay options but they are actually seperate games- type words to kill mutants(The Typing of The Dead) or just click on mutants to kill mutants(The House of The Dead). The first option is very original- You write different words and word combinations and that kills the mutants, to pick up itemas you press "tab" when you see anything you can pick up! I think you can learn new words from this gameplay option and if you wasn't good at typing without looking at the keyboard this game will probobly learn you how. The other option is to play the game just like in "Resident Evil Chronicles" games- Just shoot the mutants and shoot at the collectibles to pick them up.(In the second option you can play with the controller) Better if I don't tell anything about the story, cause this is not a "The Last Of Us" quality story, no, it's the opposite. But you will laugh over how funny diologs are and how dumb all the charcters are, trust me, you will! So yeah, buy this game! BUT don't buy the DLC's because they just give you different words that you can type in first option of the game and if you actually will be tired of the original words, you can always download interesting word packs from the workshop for free!

It's a nice game to practice typing skills with, or just relax while blasting away some zombies while making your keyboard sound like a machinegun.\n\nThere are, however, downsides to this iteration of the series. There are no mid-level missions like "Kill X zombies in Y seconds" or branching paths. Also sadly missing is the breakdown of how you did compared to previous runs. Gone also are the rank per kill depending on typing speed. And compared to House of the Dead 2 (Typing of the dead), there are more cutscenes which go on for longer. Not that any of these points are downright bad things, but they're different enough that you may want to consider if this is the entry for you.\n\nInstead of per-kill ranking which will give you different scores depending on the speed of your typing, instead you're expected to get a "goregasm" running. Basically a long combo without getting hit or making mistakes.\nAlso it's now possible to do headshots in the regular mode. With each zombie to kill you may make one mistake. While it will not count as a headshot and will thus give you less points, it will still allow you to carry on your score multiplier.\nThere is a Hardcore mode you can enable though which turns the difficulty up. When enabled any mistake will not only reset your multiplier immediately, it'll also give the zombie you were shooting a whole new word, forcing you to start over. And just to further up the difficulty: While normal mode doesn't care about punctuation, spaces and caps, Hardcode requires you to not only type perfectly, but also use shift, space and various punctuation. A step up in difficulty from the original House of the Dead.\n\nThe House of the Dead series has never been a particularly well told series, relying on plenty of cheese to go through the cutscenes. This entry however seems to ditch the downright silly plotline in favour of a grindhouse style story with an ever swearing bada** cop and A mysterious secret agent, oh and of course the tough as nails chick making an appearance a few times. If you can enjoy the swearing and general parody on this kind of movie you might find yourself enjoying the plotline of the game. If not you'll be cringing often, or feeling downright bored and hitting the key to skip the cutscenes as soon as possible.\n\nAlso included is the original House Of The Dead Overkill game, though controlled with mouse instead of light gun. And this mode still has the Director's Cut mode which extends the levels considerably. This mode is sadly missing from the typing part of the game.\n\nIn all, The Typing of the Dead: Overkill is a fun distraction if you like typing games. It's not as boring as many other typing tutors. The sentences typed aren't as unintentionally hillarious as the original game. In my opinion, it's a step to the side rather than a significant step forward or backwards in the series.\nI can recommend it to those who want a bit more variety than the original Typing of the Dead, and to anyone who wants to try the series and can't find the original. However it is by no means a game you must own, merely a fun dictraction if you like to type.","November 25, 2013","true","16.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

My previous experiences with the series had consisted of me playing the first two games of the series alongside my brother with a really crappy computer years ago using a dual mouse setup. It had already been quite long but i still remembered how we spent hours upon hours shooting the hordes of undead (err, mutants) back to the grave and shouting at each other to cover our backs.\n\nUpon launching the game a wave of nostalgia came crashing down to me, as if it was a warm welcome to a home you had spent your entire childhood running around in. Absolutely nothing has changed in this release, it might have different levels and story but the gameplay is spot-on identical to what the original titles were. It's missing the dual mouse support (And actually, local multiplayer isn't even supported although you can go online with your friends.) but that's something that most likely will not annoy you since the gameplay is so, damn, perfect.\n\nThe game consists of you trying to type sentences that are placed on the top of the zombies' heads, and after completing each sentence the creature dies. It's extremely fun and fast paced, and is something someone would even go as far to call a rhythm game. On top of that, it's even educational, yes, killing zombies can be smart! If you're someone who hasn't never really gotten into fast writing, then this game is a very powerful tool to make you learn the quirks. There are even some tutorials online from the older title to help you get on it quickly.\n\nSoundtrack in ToD:O is pretty good, it's mostly your basic "bar rock" stuff that you wont remember after turning the game off, but it gets the job done. Sound assets and graphics in the title are basic to say the least, you'll be hearing the same grunts and sounds a lot, and the zombie models are re-used quite a bit. Maybe even to a level that it might start irritating you. The game also sports a bare minimal options menu, in which you only have the option to change resolution, AA, and gamma settings. It's not a visually stunning experience but a bit more variability would have always been nice.\n\nContent wise the game is extraordinary, after finishing the story/arcade mode you'll unlock the hardcore mode which makes everything harder. You can also play the original House of the Dead: Overkill in this release, in which you can use your mouse or gamepad to shoot the zombies as you would in the arcades. And last but not least, they also decided to add a crap-ton of unlockables and minigames to keep you busy. I havent had the time to test it all, but i'm pretty sure something so mechanically perfect can be nothing less than enjoyable.\n\nBut all in all, even though it does have some shortcomings in term of the technical standpoint. It's a really good title that's jam packed to the brim with content that will keep you enjoyed for a long time.","September 8, 2014","true","2.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

In the Typing of the Dead: Overkill - a typing-themed version of on-rails shooter House of the Dead: Overkill - the light-gun is replaced with a keyboard. Zombies shamble towards you with words or phrases in front of them, which you need to type out quickly and accurately before they eat you and your fumbling digits.\n\nThis isn’t the first time a House of the Dead game has been turned into a typing tutor: it’s the same premise as the Dreamcast cult classic Typing of the Dead (1999). It’s a strange mix that works well: the goofy nature of the story and “grindhouse” aesthetic combined with comedic words at inappropriate times. While Overkill by itself was an average lightgun game, this typing iteration comes across better. It’s got a funky soundtrack, multiple difficulty levels, full Steam integration, and two-player cooperative play arrives later as free DLC. Boss encounters have been especially tweaked to better utilize the new input method.\n\nAs a bonus, the game contains the full Extended Cut of the PlayStation 3 version of Overkill, playable with a mouse or controller. Extended Cut was a re-release of the original Wii version, with improved visuals, two new levels and a bunch of tiny tweaks.","September 22, 2014","true","1.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

You can play through the game with the mouse as an straight forward FPS, but it's not why this is worth buying.  Seriously.  Play it for an hour once a week.  Your typing will improve.  Guaranteed.","July 26, 2014","true","4.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

If you haven't, a quick heads up: it's an homage to old grindhouse movies, low budget explotation made in the 70's, full of sex and violence. If a dude puking his own intestines in gruesome detailed fashion, a dog getting run over by an armored truck or a doctor moving Fergie's head, revealing her brains have been eaten by zombies mutants is something you may find amusing, I suggest a watch.\n\nNow, onto the game...\nIt's a House of the Dead game, so the gameplay is simple: you shoot zombies, they die, you fight a boss with a different mechanic at the end of the level, and bam, that's it. It's an on-rails shooter. While the older games had a rather paranormal feel this one is inspired in the movie above mentioned and the films that precede it. It's a funny and gory take on the zombie mutant outbreak. The characters are stereotyped yet not cliched, the screen get a nice messy filming filter and the music in funky as hell (well, except on the bosses, it gets a bit dubsteppy for my tastes).\n\nHere's an example quote:\n\nOriginally posted by Papa Caesar:(Being suave as hell) As you well know, Isaac, I enjoy pain. It's like a good chinese dinner, you know, with the sweet and the sour. Expanding on that analogy, I will smile with delight—that's the sweet—as you scream for your ♥♥♥♥ing life—of course, that's the sour.\nThe kind of novel part is that you type instead of shoot. It was done before in The Typing of the Dead, which was a twist on the second game in the series. Everytime a zombie pops up on the screen, you have to type the corresponding word or phrase (depending on the difficulty) fast enough so you don't get killed, or type certain letter in a QTE fashion. The default dictionary used by the game uses some amusing words related to the level you're playing in, such as nasty medical terms in the hospital level and such. A nice addition is the use of the workshop for dictionaries, which can be as helpful (different language) as funny (memes, hentai phrases). There's also paid dlc for the game, including shakespeare, sci-fi and others.\n\nThe original The House of the Dead: Overkill (2009) was released for the Wii, with the extended cut coming to PS3 a few years later adding better graphics and two new levels. This version of the game is virtually the same as the enhanced PS3 version, with the added typing gameplay. In fact, you can switch from the two versions in the main menu. The game consist of 9 levels, with three difficulty settings and well as an unlockable hardcore mode. You can also play the "House" shooter version, as well as unlock the Director's Cut version which contains different routes and challenges to complete, sadly only available in the shooter version.\n\nThere's also minigames, testing your (typing) accuracy and survavility, as well as coop, although I didn't test the option (I have no friends ;-;) and have not heard good things about it, so can't recommend it just for that.\n\nI bought this game 'cause I enjoyed the original on Wii, and I'm a fan of Grindhouse/Exploitation films, not because I'm good at typing. In fact, I'm rather terrible. The game is pretty forgiving on lower difficulties, so it's definitely a good learning platform. It's so easy that if you're a pro typist (typer?), say 100+ wpm you may find it too easy. What I did missed was the tutorial level as in the original Typing of the Dead, so I would look it up if you're after learning some typing while blasting zombies mutants.\n\nIf you're looking for achievements, you can get most of them (around 25 I believe) just by playing and replaying the game (typing, house) which shouldn't take more than 8 hours. The typing game itself is around 3 hours for a perfect play.\n\nDefinitely a buy!","February 15","true","10.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Love Agent G, Isaac Washington, Varla, etc. And Clement Darlings is one of the most ♥♥♥♥ed up villains I've ever seen in a game.\n-It also has the option to use the mouse instead of a keyboard, which is another bonus.\n-Great bosses.

Before your brain even processes anything, a zombie takes my health away. It may be a glitch, but I don't know. It's really frustrating sometimes, especially if I have Goregasm.\n\nAll in all, great game.

This unusual game actually has a history: It originally debuted on Sega's Dreamcast console in 2000 and was itself a modified version of Sega's previously released light-gun arcade game, The House of the Dead 2.\nAs with most light-gun games, The Typing of the Dead is played "on rails"--that is, you can't actually move your character or choose where to go next; the game determines that. However, depending on how quickly you defeat your enemies, you may be able to rescue innocent bystanders, uncover bonus items, and choose alternate paths through a level, though you'll always finish each level by fighting a powerful boss monster. These boss monsters will actually challenge you in a few interesting ways. For instance, one will force you to figure out and type in the correct answer to a simple question, while another will come barreling at you with a giant chainsaw and will strike you if you can't type out a full sentence in time.\nThe Typing of the Dead is an unusual game that might not have amazing graphics or sound, but its gameplay is unique and extremely fun. Despite its strange, silly premise, it does have a few explicitly gory sequences--some zombies turn into sloppy messes when shot down, which is why it's an M-rated game. But if you like action-packed games or horror movies, you'll probably enjoy The Typing of the Dead...and even if you don't, you might want to give it a try.","October 29, 2013","true","45.9"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

First off it is SEEEEGGGAAAAAAAA! and you can't go wrong with that, right?\n\nStory: It is so riduculous, there were parts me and my friend could not stop laughing!!! It didn't always make sense, but who cares it was hilarious. Very vintage 70's classic cheesy theme to it. Also remember this game is not for kids lol no not at all I don't even think the game is for adults.\n\nGameplay: It is either house of the dead or typing of the dead. You need to type words correctly and fast to kill the zombies, sounds lame but it is actually fun! The other game mode is not so much and its like shooting basically only. Typing is obviously the better choice.\n\nSountrack: Amazing soundtrack every song in it is just awesome. One thing Sega knows how to do is give kickass music to their gameplay.\n\nGraphics: NOTHING! NOTHING! NOTHING! NOTHING! When you have nothing good to say just say NOTHING! (typing of the dead joke). Gotta admit it is the worst part of the game. Way too many glitches and it just felt gross. It wasn't something you would expect in 2013... maybe 2003.\n\n8/10 good game to play in fun factor, but I wouldn't show it off to everyone only people who have a very dark humor.\n\n\nNOTHING!

I like even more when you can go head to head with friends in a co-op mode to see who can type more words per minute.\n\nThe story is alright. It's a comedy in the style of an old grindhouse action film. The humor doesn't always hit it's mark and sometimes goes a bit overboard with a joke until it's been beaten into the ground. It assumes every one of it's jokes is a riot and proceeds to keep doing those same jokes ad nauseum. There are a few jokes that hit the mark but they're few and far between.\n\nThe game itself is buggy as heck. Co-op partners are prone to disconnecting from each other. And the game will occationally freeze for no reason. It has a lot that should have been ironed out and never was.\n\nOverall I enjoy the game but I'd completly understand if someone hated it. I uninstalled it after beating the story once because co-oping was extreamly tedious due to dropped connections that were caused by the game itself.\n\n","October 25, 2014","true","3.0"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

It has a corny 70s cop show style storyline and videos to match. The main characters are straight out of a Dolemite movie. It has boss fights, items/power-ups you can grab along the way, humorous words to type.\nThe thing im liking most about this is, im an extremely fast typer, but i have trouble not looking at the keyboard. I dont type the way they taught me in school with my fingers positioned onmt he right buttons and such because that never worked for me, i type slow when i do it that way. For the most part i know where the ksy are, but i still need to sneak a peek at the keyboard to type a lot correctly. I feel like if i keep playing this game it will cure that, and i will no longer have to look at the keyboard to type. You have to be fast to survive in this game, otherwise youre going to die quick.\n\nMy recommendation is, if you are an at least semi-fast typer as it is, go ahead and grab this game, it will make you even faster.\nIf you are a slow typer, just forget it, because youre never going to even get past the first level, and its going ot frustrate the hell out of you, although if your hearts in it i guess you could use htis as a tool to learn how to type fast.\n\nall in all, on a scale of 1 through 10 i would give this a 9/10.","January 12, 2014","true","3.5"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

No no, not like that. Use your words! Seriously though, type the living hell out of those creatures for a load of fun. The story is rather short, but there is a multiplayer option alongside of a leaderboard to see just how great (or pitiful) you really are compared to the rest of the world. Luckily though, the story is humorous, cheesy, and rather compelling for some reason. While it can be quite crude and rather silly, it is probably worth the laugh. The mechanics are simple, however it can be challenging given that you can type only a wee bit faster than a turtle can walk. Everybody is bound to have some sort of fun with this title! Really though, name a person who doesn't want to write a novel in order to kill a zombie, err, mutant. The graphics have improved a bit from the Wii port of House of the Dead: Overkill, which by the way is included in this purchase. The mechanics for that, however, are odd considering that you do not have a motion controller and must point and click to shoot. It's definitely a decent buy for fans of the series, and is definitely worth buying, but if you'd rather have a gun in hand and shoot your CRT television set with lasers, I would recommend playing the original few games. If you like typing your problems away, well, play this or the original Typing of the Dead on the Sega Dreamcast!

Dark humor, interesting/funny story, tons of swearing and lots of gore! Playable with keyboard or mouse.\n\nThis review will be split in 2 parts as there are 2 different ways to play:\n\nThe Typing of the Dead: Overkill.\n\nThe whole point of the game is to type the words as fast as you can, while prioritizing whatever is coming at you first ( projectiles, mutants, etc. ) It's pretty basic in that aspect but nonetheless, very fun. Also you have to keep your eyes open for bonuses and collectibles! I'm sure this game would greatly improve your typing speed if you play it alot. Mixing typing and a video game together makes it surprisingly addictive if you like those 2 things.\n\nI do type 120 words+ a minute and ''medium'' and ''hard'' difficulties are both just right for me. I can tell that there is not that much difference between the 2, but it is not as easy as I thought it would be, I didin't complete a level perfectly yet and i'm currently trying to do that. The ''easy'' mode is probably fine for almost everybody who can type without looking at a keyboard. I only played it once to test it and it was alot easier than the other modes.\n\nIn the end, the story mode took me 2 hours 30 minutes to finish, which is pretty short, but there's other stuff to do in the game anyways! Such as Mini-games, House of the Dead, Hardcore-mode... Etc.\n\n-------\n\nThe House of the Dead: Overkill.\n\nI was really surprised by this. The game actually has the whole story mode, playable with the mouse, just like the good old House of the Dead! Even the mini-games, challenges and more are playable with the mouse!\n\nYou even have a gun shop, you gain gold while playing and you can upgrade your guns ( 5 upgrades per gun with 2 levels each ) and there is 6+ weapons.\n\nI found the accuracy to be pretty harsh with the automatic guns... Guess I should have sticked to pistol, but oh well. The story is really different with a mouse, the bosses are not played the same way and if you are better at FPS games than you are at typing on a keyboard, this mode will be easier for you.\n\n-------\n\nOverall, I recommend this game, the few bugs I have found so far weres not being able to shoot 2 mutants, after I used a grenade on them in the House of the Dead, sound clips missing during slow-mos and Rage mutant finishing blows, game closing and re-opening itself after typing a word, the rest of the levels played just fine.","March 14, 2014","true","13.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Game is locked to a 16:9 aspect ratio and you can't change the resolution to another aspect ratio, so I have to play in windowed mode at a very low resolution so that nothing is cut off.\n\nGameplay is alright, but nothing special. Would have been better if there was more variety in the weapons or less predicatble boss battles. Oh, and the final boss is completely out of line with the rest of the game, really weird mechanic for defeating it. I kind of get what they were trying to do but they executed it very poorly.\n\nCharacters are annoying as hell, the dialogue makes my ears bleed. The story was written by a fourth grader for his first english class assignment, and character development is non existent. I didn't buy this game for an in depth story, but just an FYI that there is none.\n\nThe mini games are fun for a couple minutes, there is one where you fight wave by wave, which is kind of what I was hoping for to be honest.\n\nWould not recommend this game at full price of $20, no way. Maybe if it goes on sale for $5 you should pick it up. You're better off playing the original Typing of the Dead instead, maybe one day they'll bring that to Steam.","July 1, 2014","false","3.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

If you’re a fan of typing games or want to improve your typing skills, you should definitely buy this game. 8/10","April 18, 2014","true","4.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Typing of the Dead: Overkill is one bloody brilliant throwback to the kitsch Zombi-...err...mutant...films of the 70's and 80's of course it plays up almost every aspect of these films and the result is an extremely OTT hop,skip and jump through a gore filled grindhouse fest that left me laughing more or less from start to finish.\n\nThis game includes both the typing version and the bog standard *Click and shoot* original so theres certainly a good few hours of gameplay here if you want to unlock all the achievements by playing both games. The dialogue is comedy gold and the controls are precise. you rarely feel cheated while playing, though the game will often get the odd cheap shot in by putting a Mutant right on the other side of a door which, as your on a rail (Its a rail shooter) will occassionally score a cheap knock of damage.\n\nGraphically...it's a sega Zombie shoot-em-up based on an Arcade machine of the same name...it's never going to look cutting edge...but it's good enough certainly (Though it does suffer somewhat from bad to no lip synching on dialogue)\n\nPersonally, if you've already played the likes of Left4Dead2 and are looking for a new challenge or if you just have utter nostalgia for the days you could find games like Time Crisis in any arcade or fast food place This game is a perfect addition to your Steam Library, while I cant say it's the best Zombie game out there, in the case of this game I would argue that it isnt a point. This is the Cheeseburger of Zombie games...and sometimes; you just need a cheeseburger in your life.","August 26, 2015","true","6.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It was cheesy and hilarious to watch agents with dreamcasts strapped on their backs, keyboards hanging at their chests. This game, sadly, does not sport any keyboards in the couple levels that I played. Instead, the game depicts guns...\n\nSimilarly, I didn't see any god hands powerup. The ability to pound/mash keyboard buttons and "magically" get 100% accuracy (while powerup was active) was very fun. None of my friends could believe the ridiculousness of a typing game that didn't actually teach typing/grade on accuracy. Again, I didn't find any such power up in this version.\n\nRegarding the content that the game has, it's okay. I wouldn't recommend the full price for a gag game. It comes with a port of the House Of The Dead: Overkill game, if you want to play without typing.\n\nWhen playing with typing, I end up spamming the tab key in between words to make sure that I don't miss any of the collectible pick ups (poster art, sound tracks, etc), and that gets pretty tedious very fast.","June 27, 2014","false","0.8"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Equally possible, however, is the disappointment that you may find. The previous ToD I and II were truly awesome games with a thoughtful design of gameplay and at the same time focused on their educational aspect. Unfortunately much of their these are actually missing in this installment.\n\nFor starters, in this game you won't find any keyboards and Dreamcasts, which were just signatures for the previous game. Also missing were the items like molotov cocktails available for pick up, which added fun and could be life-savers. In place of these were concept arts, audio tracks, 3D models which are unlockable. Worse still, these are not collected by typing certain letters or words like you would in the previous games, but by pressing TAB key, which is rather meaningless. As these are not as noticeable as they should, this could mean that you may be better off just to press TAB key every now and then. In-game challenges (e.g. defeat 30 zombies) with rewards are also non-existent. Maintaining combos only gets your a better score instead of life bonuses. Gameplay is also straightforward without twists like answering a question as in the previous games.\n\nCompared to the previous installments, this game is rather easy at NORMAL or HARD difficulty. But the hardcore mode, which put emphasis on accuracy, could on the other hand be too hard. In this mode, if you make a mistake in the middle of a word then the phrase would change and you will have to start over again. You would also have to type spaces, which you may find quite annoying if you're used to the previous games or the non-hardcore mode. To make things worse, if you are too slow the zombies would just keep attacking you, unlike in the previous games where they would slow down after you lost a life and give you a chance to pick up momentum again. This, coupled with the fact that you have to restart when miss, could cost you two or three lives when you make a single mistake, which could be rather frustrating. In addition, I've been in times when I noticed my mistake only after a few letters, only to know that I was already locked on the new phrase(s) which contained some same letters, which could be very confusing as I was wondering where I was. Although it could have been a good idea to require spaces as in the real world, the game failed in this aspect by not having any visual cues for spaces. Therefore I am always wondering if I've typed the spaces as I am so used to the previous games, and have lost many lives either because I had to stop and think or because I remembered it wrong, which means retyping the phrase. Another problem is the difficulty to figure out which text box corresponds to the zombie closest to you. At times I have to wait until the box changes to red before I could be sure, which could be too late. If you've noticed, in the previous installments the words got harder if you were doing well and vice versa, which kept you always under pressure to improve. It is not the case in this game.\n\nThe game offers unlimited credits at the cost of half your score, which I find not as challenging as the previous games. Also, as long as you finish a level you will unlock the next, no matter what difficulty you attempted. The minigames are somewhat cosmetic and meaningless, instead of focus on a particular area (e.g. accuracy, reflexes, special keys) helping you to improve.\n\nAll in all, this game did not inherit much of the merits from the previous games and boils down to a dull and repetitive gameplay with a few nuisances. That said, I suppose the game is not that bad if you forget the previous installments.","November 12, 2014","false","37.8"," 9 of 19 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","9","19","0","0"

Prior to that game I was a “search and peck” (looked and the keyboard looking for the key to press, press it then search for the next letter in the work I wished to type) but just after a few days I found myself typing without looking down.\n\nThe original game began with step #1 like any typing game/program does and that is with the basic “A S D F” on your left hand and “J K L ;” on your right hand. The game will then show you what keys you hit with great accuracy and what keys you have trouble with. (Not everyone knows this or have even noticed the small raised line or dot on the “F” and “J” keys on the keyboards) You could only imagine my confusion as to why would any typing game never mind a sequel to the typing of the dead would overlook this very basic of basis!  At the very least the first mission on its lowest difficulty could have been used to learn the ASDF and JKL; keys before the player is expected to type “Jasper V2”\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=238769932\n\n…But what if this is not supposed to be something to help your typing skills?\nAlthough the original was hilarious due to its poor voice acting, this game not funny because of the excessive searing. Every single cut scene from this game (including the very first one) has someone saying Mother F*cker, Sh*t, F*ck and so on. You could swear it was written by a 12 year old.\n\nAt the very least the mode where you use your mouse to shoot a gun is fun, this should have been the original basis for the game since they face planted with the typing version.\n\nPS: I am proud to say I am now a very efficient typist, I am just very disappointed in how far my tutor's series has fallen.","March 15, 2014","false","1.4"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

I thought it was a cool way to teach people how to type with speed and accuracy. However, this game... It's just not fun. I might not have the credibility of those who have done full run throughs or played this game for over 7 hours, but hear me out.\n\nThe most important part of any game is the first impression of it. If the first impression is not very exciting, then this game will not be very appealing towards its audience. This game has that same problem: a very weak first impression. It tries to make a very floppy story with cliche's everywhere in its comedic-satire on the whole film industry. However, that lackluster story makes this game really hard to play.\n\nAlong with, the biggest selling point to the first Typing of the Dead was that it had fun phrases that were childish, but could make you laugh. This game does not really have those, if they are later in the game then I have not seen them being that I'm only on level 4. That lack of fun, childish phrases really siphons the whole thought about the game being about learning how to type.\n\nThis game lacks the sheer fun quality to it. Am I saying that this is a bad game? No, it's just not fun. I would not recommend buying this game. I would try to find the original (if you still can) and playing that because it is much more fun than this game.","December 1, 2014","false","1.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Rzep/recommended/246580/","Rzep","Rzep","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Rzep/","1372 products in account","Having passed the game twice now I think I can write a small review for a title that I think many will overlook.\n\nI will start off with the worst part about this game and that is it's heritage. It is a Wii game that was expanded and ported over to the PS3, which is the version that has now been ported to PC. Being originally a Wii game means that the game will not win any Best Graphics awards, but oddly enough I think this work to the games benefit. This is the only game that has captured the B-movie grindhouse feel and I think the rough graphics are a part of that. The game is also only a few hours long like any Light gun game, but the story and the way it is told is without a question better than 99% of other games in the genre.\n\nThere are two ways to play the game. The first is by typing, the other by using the mouse instead of a light gun. Typing is really good fun and gets pretty hard later into the game. Using the mouse isn't bad but it's no light gun. Since I am used to FPS games, playing with a mouse and not having control over movement was hard to get used to. Even though the game is still fun this way there were many moments of frustration when I lost a combo due to hitting nothing but air because the character moved unexpectadly. Still, it's easy to get around this. Simply be more conservative with the lead. In this mode you can buy and upgrade various weapons with money earned during a mission. A small tip, forget the slow and powerful guns, go for speed.\n\nSince the mouse mode is good but not great the main appeal is of course Typing of the Dead and in short it is amazing. It feels alot better to type and get a gunshot sound with each letter. The number of difficulty levels for this part of the game is also great since there isn't a teaching mode. There are 3 to choose from, one is unlocked after beating the game and there is an additional modifier in the form of Hardcore mode, which can be applied to any of the standard difficulties. Hardcore mode means that you have to use the space bar and punctuation matter sure, but it also means that if you make a mistake the word changes.\n\nThere are 3 mini games for both modes. They are decent but nothing too compelling. A nice touch is the number of collectibles that can be unlocked in game. There is cocept art to find, poster to unlock, 3d Models, songs and a full length comic book. There is alot of it and it's not always easy to find them all so it's good that the game is highly replayable. I would suggest that people play the game both ways with a keyboard and mouse. The story is the same, but the control methods make it a very different experiance. I should also mention that passing the game in mouse mode unlocks a Directors Cut of the game, so there's another reason to pass it once more.\n\nOverall this is a great gama that should not be missed. The story is fun, the typing mechanic fairly unique and very satysfying. So far I have put more hours into this than I do in for example a typical FPS games campaign and having passed the game twice now I know that I will be passing it at least once more with hardcore mode on throughout.\n\nEdit: Just started Directors Cut and it's faster, harder and the missions themselves also seem to have more stuff. So here is another reason to pass the game=)","December 18, 2013","true","11.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Game is 7GB download and 7GB on the hard drive.  It is larger than GTA V.  This is mostly from cut scenes.  Game does not care about punctuation or capitalization during gameplay so it is not helpful at improving typing skills.  Game also moves at a very fast pace regardles of the difficulty level you select, so it is really bad for beginners.\n\nThey were obviously going for a "B movie" feel but it feels forced.  This game feels like it used to be a simple mouse based shooter on rails but they made it a typing game at the last minute.\n","June 17, 2015","false","0.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

NOTHING in this game has changed from The House of The Dead: Overkill besides the added typing and it was done pretty lazily. There are Power Ups still in the game that you can't get, which is annoying.\n\n2. At least for me, the game doesn't work unless you go to your computer files and set it to Windows 8 Compatibility mode. Even if you do that, the game usually crashes when playing The House of The Dead: Overkill.\n\n3. This game is swear feast 2013. Like, why are there so many swears? They overuse them way too much and it gets annoying. This game had so many swears that it held a record in the Guiness Book of World Records for most profanity in a game. And this isn't even that long of a game. It's only around 5 hours long. If it had been like Mafia 2 where that game is a reasonal amount of time and has quite long DLC, then I would accept it. However, this game isn't long.\n\nI however MUST recommend this game. This game has Cheesy B-Movie Story Dialogue. The story isn't that written seriously at all. This also has to be the most fun you'll ever have while typing. If you get tired of the typing or don't like it, it luckily includes The House of The Dead: Overkill, which is still amazing, but like I said, prepare for crashing.\n\nI would recommend trying to get the original Typing of the Dead on PC, which you could probably find on ebay or amazon for a reasonable price. However, if you can't get that, then this is a must buy.","August 31, 2015","true","2.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It also has online play with a friend invite and random matching system.\n\nThe game is presented in the style of a series of B-movie trailers and offers a surprising amount of laughs. There is a plot, but it's more about the laughs than quality story telling.\n\nAs for actual gameplay, it's pretty much what you expect: words show up on the screen next to zom--er, "mutants," and you type the words to kill them. Apart from the quick single letter bonus enemies, typing words has the effect of body shots, giving you more time to finish typing a word after you start it. The game can still be difficult, however, as nerves can lead to slip ups that can give the enemies enough time to get at you, and the game does have a lot of jump-scare type events. Consecutive kills grant bonus points in both typing and rail shooter modes. You also get bonus points in typing mode by not making any mistakes during a word or phrase. There are bonuses scattered about the levels that make you have to pay attention to more than just words popping up on the screen, as they are unmarked and require a press of the tab key to obtain.\n\nThe rail shooter mode does not allow you to change the mouse sensitivity in-game, which is unfortunate as it is quite a bit slower than what I am used to. You do get used to it though. Head shots are one hit kills on most enemies and you receive bonus points for every 5 enemies you chain in such a manner. Current combo level is represented by a phrase and number of bullets in the chamber on the top left of the screen. Bonuses can be shot at and should be a priority as the camera moves soon after all enemies are defeated which can prevent you from grabbing them.\n\nThe game also features a number of multi-stage boss fights and mini-games. With all the game modes, humour, and online play for one low price, this makes quite a decent purchase.","November 28, 2013","true","8.1"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

The typing mechanism works well and is well thought out. Too bad the "storyline" and the characters are terrible.\n\nLong version - spoilers ahead:\nGameplay: Typing of the Dead has some really nifty typing mechanics that makes this game fast paced, just like an arcade shooter. You will type single letters, abbreviations, words and sentences in order to kill the mutants (see game screenshots). What I did not expect was that there is a fair element of strategy where you might surrender writing a long sentence to hit a couple of single keys as these tend to have a shorter time span before they hurt you. Some words are long and unusual forcing you to keep your eyes off the keyboard in order to see how they are spelled. The difficulties seem to be designed with progression in mind, and thus you actually become a better typer as you play!\n\nStory: The game is obviously not meant to be serious in any shape or form. Many of the words and sentences tht you write are related to the environment around you and can sometimes be quite clever, making you smile and sometimes lose your pace.\n\nUnfortunatley thats where the positive experiences end. Apart from the above, this story can best be described as trying to cross as many lines as possible, and then claiming that it's ok - because comedy. I disagree, mainly because it's not funny.\n\nThe main characters are: A white guy trying to be cool and a black guy cursing. Then there are two side-kicks who are best described as "boobs with guns" - one of them being extraordinaryly stupid. The game makes sure that we see them this way by focusing the camera on their breasts whenever possible. Of course, they don't survive. After finishing the storyline I've seen racism, sexism, incest and disabled people being bullied, and that just ain't comedy unless your idea of fun is "Ha ha, that guy is in a wheelchair".\n\nI know that the story comes from the original and they guys who created the typing-mod deserve a lot of credit for a game well done. However I just couldn't shake the bad story and found myself dreading the next cutscene and this is why I don't recommend this game. Hopefully someday there will be a brand new installment of this game where the characters and story have received some love. That game would be a 10/10 for sure.","March 22, 2014","false","5.8"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

I've always kind of enjoyed typing games, and while I don't think this game has much merit in teaching you how to type properly, it's a fun game with an interesting sense of humor.\n\nThere's not too much to talk about with the gameplay. You type as quickly as possible, using Tab to pick up secrets and power-ups. What's more interesting to discuss with this game is how it's presented: as an old, low-budget horror movie. It tries very hard to be as cheesy as possible. Sometimes the phrases you type relate to the level you're playing, which gets pretty funny in the strip club level. This game is a bit lewd at times, and the swearing is excessive... not saying that's a bad thing, but it's something you should know going in to it.\n\nTyping of the Dead: Overkill also includes House of the Dead: Overkill. The story is the same, but you play a standard rail shooter with normal controls instead of typing. I like switching between the two, just to change things up. House of the Dead is a little older, but as far as I know, this the only way to play the game on PC.\n\nIf a rail shooter or typing game sounds fun to you, then this would be a good game to pick up. There's a lot of content in this game, I don't think you'll be disappointed. Rail shooters and typing games aren't for everyone, and this game probably won't win you over to the genre (unless the movie aesthetic really appeals to you, I guess), but I've had a lot of fun with it so far, and I plan to keep playing it for a little while","September 20, 2014","true","14.1"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Additionally the designs are just as you would expect from a HoTD game if not surpassing them in a positive way with the overal graphical designs and the boss designs to boot. The gameplay itself works out well, the typing is as responsive as your keyboard is and the mouse-aim shooting version plays just as well.\n\nAlso, the addition of Steam Workshop for fan-made dictionaries was a good move, but somewhat questionable given how we're offered dictionaries we have to pay for, that can be more than easily duplicated for free in the workshop? Not like I'm complaining, I still bought them to be supportive, that and I find Shakespearean language quite, interesting.\n\nAll in all, if you want a fun typing game, a typing enhancment tutor, or an on rail zombie shooter, Typing of The Dead: Overkill is a great choice.","June 21, 2015","true","13.0"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

But yes, it is a game where you kill zombies by......TYPING on your keyboard stuff that comes on the screen. If you are familiar with the house of the dead series (ever been to some arcade game center?), this is just as fun, with grindhouse style, funny dialogues etc. On pc is almost impossible to properly have a peripheral that simulates a gun (on PS you have PS move, on wii the wiimote...), so they chose they keyboard as a shooting device. It's LOTS of fun. I have a mechanical keyboard (Razer Blackwidow latest version) and it just looks like you're machine-gun-shooting letters in the face of the enemies. If you are a fast typer you will really enjoy the challenge. If you are a slow typer, you will enjoy it too, just will die more :D\n\nAlso reading the words that come on screen is fun because they may make you laugh from time to time. Funny stuff.\n\nOn the downside, the normal 'house of the dead' which is required anyway if you want to get all achievements, is boring as hell....shooting stuff with a mouse watching the cursor is not really entertaining......\n\nOnly CONS:\n\n- they released different vocabularies (check the DLCs).....but each vocabulary is sold separately and is not very cheap. They should have released all the dictionaries in the normal release of the game, without limiting to one or two dictionnaries.\n\n- the game renders at 720p whatever resolution you choose.

After the game crashed on me at the end of a level, without saving my progress, I decided to write this negative review. Ok, here we go...\n\nGraphics\n-Sub-par graphics with crappy textures and cutscenes. For a game released in 2013, it sure looks alot like a game released in 2007.\n+Runs at a steady 60 fps (which it should).\n+Most cards can run this game smoothly.\n-The game crashed a few times with no explaination.\n\nGameplay\n+I LOVE the on-rails shooter style this game provides. It brings back the arcade nostalgia for me.\n+The core concept of the game is incredibly fresh and fun. It's a great way to brush up on your typing speed.\n+The words and phrases you will be typing are at times, hilarious. Examples include: Blue ♥♥♥♥, Cumquat Smuggler, Goat Curry, and Leper Handshake\n-The characters are annoying as hell, and so is their back and forth banter. The characters themselves are cheesy and over-the-top (which I know is the point), but it gets really annoying.\n-Bad humor EVERYWHERE. I curse like a sailor in my daily life, but Jesus Christ the language and humor was just over the top ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. It eventually got to the point where I just turned the game's master volume down and pulled up youtube in another window...thats how boring the "story" is. And YES, there are a few times I found myself chuckling, but overall, the jokes were just plain dumb and cheesy as hell.\n-The voice acting from some of the characters in the game was terrible. Especially from one of the female characters, she just sounded unnatural when she cursed (like she was trying too hard).\n+There are boss battles at the end of each level, which is a nice touch. Unfortunately some bosses are just TOO easy, but overall the bosses were unique enough to keep me interested.\n-The campaign is short. It took me 3.2 hours to beat the story mode on normal mode.\n+Varying levels of difficulty can make the game challenging as hell.\n+Zombies.\n\nStory\n-As stated before, the story is boring and uninteresting.\n+I do, however, love the television show style of storytelling. I thought that was pretty original (and cheesy in a good way).\n-Character development is lacking.\n\nConclusion\nThis game is fun, I'll give it that. The humor is over-the-top and seems unnatural at times. I feel like the game was trying too hard to be funny in an edgy way. I also think that $20 is WAYYYYYYY TOOOOOO EXPENSIVE! NEVER, and I mean NEVER pay $20 for this game. I payed $5 for it on sale and bought the DLC for an extra few dollars and I think that's a fair price. Buy this game when it's on sale.

A game I played at work. Yes, the company invested in a typing game to see if it improved our touch typing skills. Of course, it didn't, but memories of blokes walking around with Dreamcasts strapped to their backs made me want this. Firstly 0 points for the system specs listed They seem to be much higher than what's needed... "Graphics: ATI Radeon HD 6450, NVIDIA GeForce GT 220 or Intel Integrated Graphics HD 3000 ". I'm running this on an ATI Radeon 4650 with drivers from 2012. Works like a charm\n\nMy one bug-bear with the game, and I can't believe I'm typing this, is the amount of unneccesary swearing in the game. I'm not syaing it in a prudish way, but it's used so often, it just comes across as lazy and forced. I spend every cut scene not actually paying attention to the story, but thinking "I wonder when the next unneccessary F-bomb comes al.... ah, there it is." Storyline-wise, it's not a game that grips you. Unless you're a "house Of The Dead" fan, I assume.\n\nAnd so, to the gameplay. This is where it's the killer. You can either touch-type or you can't. If you can, graphics are important, and I can't possibly make a valid comment on them, as a) my card is a generation or so below the minimum and b) I can't touch type, meaning that my eyes are constantly flitting away from the screen around the keyboard.\n\nI'll probably keep returning to it, putting in an hour or so here or there.

The game is essentially useless in learning to type ACCURATELY, as you can just smash the keyboard, type without spaces, and never capitolize without penalty.\n\nIts obvious, but you should give players more options that allow them to customize how much accuracy they need; I want missed letters, spaces and capitol letters to count against the word (start over or backspace to fix).

Really…you kill zombies by typing words correctly? Although I’ve admittedly not played the House of the Dead games outside of arcades, I felt like I couldn’t pass up this opportunity when I saw it. I’ve never played the original House of the Dead: Overkill either, although it is baked-in along with this new keyboard-based game.\n\nAs far as game mechanics go, it’s pretty much exactly what it advertises – words will pop up on the screen above zombies, and your success is based upon how quickly and accurately you can key in those words. Your characters move from room to room on rails, sometimes barreling through an entire squadron of undead, other times not moving forward until you’ve essentially committed zombie genocide. This is one of the few games in which I feel the DLC is needed, as it increases the dictionary of words used with interesting themes, such as a Shakespeare pack or a sports lexicon. Some of the words and phrases are absolutely wacky, and I loved the challenge it provided for both my fingers and my mind.\n\nAs for the story – that’s where the real charm of this game is found. The entire adventure is presented as a grindhouse-style flick, and there’s a filter over the action that shows film noise and burns, which I felt really set a tone right from the start. Every cutscene is appropriately ludicrous and crass; the main characters swear and curse with incredible conviction, which is actually addressed within the dialogue itself during the few quiet moments between levels. Traveling between setpieces, the characters will occasionally make a comment on their situation, or their relationship in regards to each other. It’s an incredibly honest approach to the standard zombie apocalypse gore fest, and at one point the male protagonists recognize that they are stereotypical macho men going who have to save the strongest female protagonist. I really wasn’t expecting a type-‘em-up zombie game to have an interesting, existential view of the genre as a whole, and yet there it was.\n\nOtherwise, the game is comparatively offensive and comical as an episode of South Park. You’ll hear scat jokes as you attack a giant-headed, wheelchair-bound, Stephen-Hawking-esque zombie, for example. But, the game stays so consistent with how ham-fisted it is with being distasteful that it actually is engaging and fun throughout. Had the game attempted to be serious and grim, it would have failed miserably.\n\nI did attempt to play the original House of the Dead: Overkill which is included, but the options for controller support is very scant. There’s no option to adjust the reticle sensitivity, and as a result I felt like the crosshairs were flying all over the screen, even during slow-motion sections. It feels like the typing aspect of this game is the main attraction, which certainly isn’t a bad thing.\n\nI don’t know the next time that one of these House of the Dead typing games will be released, but I enjoyed my time with this one so much that I’ll probably grab whatever comes next as well. Recommended for anyone looking for something entirely new to the shooting genre.","December 8, 2014","true","3.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Originally came out on the Wii as House of the Dead: Overkill, that game wound up re-released on the Playstation 3 with updated graphics and extra missions that tell a bigger story. And then the Steam version is a polished port of that, though with two games for the price of one (the original House of the Dead: Overkill comes with this).\n\nDue to porting, yes, the graphics look pretty good, though one can tell it came from lower-end spectrum of graphics (though still look pretty decent). The gore factor (which the of the Dead series has been known for) is present, though could use a bit more... effect.\n\nBut obviously, this is a typing excercise where stringing together words and phrases nets you kills, and keeping mistakes to a minimum will jack-up ones score pronto.\n\nEverything else from the previous Overkill experiences are still intact... lots of F-bombs flying, lots of over-the-top Grindhouse-esque sequences, lots of (zombified) strippers (for one level only), and plenty of fun that belies the fact that this game is a prequel to everything else within the of the Dead universe.\n\nCan't go wrong with sharpening your typing skills while fending off something that wants to eat your face.","January 7, 2015","true","5.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It has a zom...mutant outbreak that you must survive. The two character dynamic is very similar to that of Pulp Fiction, so that alone, if you liked that movie, makes it worth playing. The House of the Dead section of this game is tha exact same storyline, but instead of typing you are using the mouse to shoot and you upgrade weapons to improve your score. The art style as a whole is very "B-movie" like and that alone makes the game enjoyably dumb as you enjoy cliche after cliche from the B-movie era. The way this "film" plays out is quite well done because not only are you laughing at the cliches, but to some degree you begin to care about the budding friendship of G and Washington. Also in my opinion the last boss has the greatest troll ending ever. It is a very simple title that imporves your typing as you play, and is capable of Co-op, but i myself haven't tried it. Very easy to run on almost any system realistically speaking. Replay may be there for people who want to 100% the game, or with friends to see who can type faster or as friendly competition. An interesting title just as an homage to the original and if you can get it on a good sale is worth it for the laugh. I recommend playing it all in one go cause it is kinda short unless you are going for 100% because the challenge for that is quite extensive and fun to work on in my case.","December 30, 2014","true","6.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game strays away from the tone set by the other games in the House of the Dead/Typing of the Dead series by practically being a parody of zombie action films.

In the fact that you have to type words in order to do anything. Which is nice if you want to improve you overall typing speed/accuracy. While this game seems fun (I guess), the painful story and audio absolutley ruin the game. It always feel like there is a lag. For the amount of time they give you to type some words seem ridiculous. Either you get like 8 seconds to type in 2-3 decent words i.e (intimidate and story time) or they might give you 1-2 secs to type in Ooze or Zed.

In terms of language, premise, and treatment of female characters - this game is a full 31 different flavors of wrong.  It puts the over the top grindhouse aesthetic into an Indy Jones minecart and sends it careening down the tracks at breakneck speed to burst through a wall already starting to explode with 5 tons of C4. That's how flat out wrong it is.   Consider yourself duly warned if you're unfamiliar with Overkill from the real world setting.\n\nThat said : I'm a fan of the Typing of the Dead treatments of the House of the Dead games.  I bought this largely on the strength of the first 'Typing of the Dead' experience, which was good silly zombie killing fun.  I'm a fairly accurate typist, so it was fun diversion and I was glad to see more of the same available on Steam.\n\nSo do we have zombies to kill? Check.\n\nDo we have absurd and fun things to type to kill the zombies? Check.\n\nAre there lots of them? Check. There are indeed. Several container ship's worth of zombies to kill.  All kinds of check.\n\nEntertaining boss battles?    Semi-check.  So-so. The original "Typing of the Dead''s boss fights took the absurdist typing up a few notches, giving you full sentences to type to inflict damage.  Overkill's boss battles are largely more standard zombie kill words with a fancy setpiece. So that was a little disappointing.  I will say this, though - the boss mechanic does get changed up entertainingly for the final conflict. That one I enjoyed.\n\nDo we see our protagonists running around with comedy keyboards to type on hanging from their necks?  Sadly - no, we do not.\n\nDo we have the option to use the mouse as a targeting reticule?  Well, yes. But I have fully no clue why you'd want to when the word 'Typing' is in the title...\n\nAt the end of the day, your enjoyment of Overkill will likely hinge on two things : Can you enjoy a game where typing accuracy is a game feature, and can you get past the content issues noted above?\n\nUltimately I found the game was enjoyable enough.  I rolled my eyes at more than a few things, though, and this isn't a game I'd break out for a mixed company party. I even laughed at some of it.\n\nI just wasn't always very proud of that.\n\n","November 26, 2013","true","18.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

From other reviews and footage of the game ive seen, its been perfecly fine. Plus, how the hell can you go wrong with killing zombies by typing stuff like "UNICORNS" and "Sexual Tyrannosaur"? Thats just awesome.\n\nHowever, the major issue with this game is it wont even start up. Every time I open it, im greeted to a black screen, and then it crashes. There really isnt much else i can do to get this game to start, ive re-dowloaded it twice, done all the support tips I can find, nothing works. Im not doing it on a computer that cant handle the game, infact its stonger than the recomended system requirements stated on the steam page. (not that hard to do) The only issue i havent been able to fix is having Nvidia drivers ( which i have updaded to the newest update, didnt fix the issue). However, all of my other games I own work perfectly fine with my driver, so what excuse does that give TOTD:O?\n\nTo add insult to injury, none of the Sega help desk numbers work (I didnt just try the Australia number, tested everyone. And at different times as well. Every number went directly to beeping), then again, i cant blame them, they are getting compliants everywhere about how trash Sonic Boom: Rise Of Lyric is. Thats another story to cover, but i dont feel murdering the inner child inside that loves Sonic so much.\n\nWhat happned Sega? This game has been out for over a year and you still havent fixed this issue? Youve let me down. I might as well go boot up Mario Teaches Typing instead ( as much as i wish i thought of that first, it already exists). It dosnt have zombie killing action and hilarious lines, but it actally works.\n\n\nEDIT: After at least 40 mins of trying to get the game to work, FINALLY WORKS, and its a hell load of fun. Though i still would not recomend even after all the troubble i had.\n\nEDIT EDIT: I might of changed my mind, i swear the music in this is actually freaking awesome, plus the best story ever. Just be aware, this is no complex story, its hell corny but thats whats so great. On top of that, Sega didnt just put The typing of the dead overkill in this game, you also get the house of the dead overkill as well :D Same story, but you can kill zombies with your mouse or controler instead of keyboard. Dont even attempt using controler, you will die every second, but mouse works really well. Im happy both these modes are included, gives me more achievements to hunt for.\n\nWould recomend this now. Maybe not for $30, but wait for a steam sale and give it a shot. Just be aware of some bugs with starting the game, but its pretty worth it. Plus my typing has improved a lot just in a coupple of days. So thats awesome :D","November 28, 2014","true","6.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In the fact that you have to type words in order to do anything. Which is nice if you want to improve you overall typing speed/accuracy. While this game seems fun (I guess), the painful story and audio absolutley ruin the game. It always feel like there is a lag. For the amount of time they give you to type some words seem ridiculous. Either you get like 8 seconds to type in 2-3 decent words i.e (intimidate and story time) or they might give you 1-2 secs to type in Ooze or Zed.

I loved the hell out of the original DreamCast TOTD back in the day, and in a rare move, actually bought this one around release time, at full price. In the strictest sense, it is a Typing of the Dead game: you type words and not-zombie zombies go splat. However, Overkill lacks a lot of the goofy charm that made the original so memorable and enjoyable, and it's not just that G and Isaac aren't running around with laptops strapped to their backs and keyboards floating in front of them. It's possible that part of the problem is that the joke only works once, but I think the bigger issue is that, well, it's based on House of the Dead: Overkill.\n\nThere's frankly nothing likeable whatsoever about Overkill. The dialogue is insipid and juvenile, and can only partially be avoided by skipping cutscenes. Everything about the visual design is grotesque, even by the standards of a zombie game, in a way that's off-putting rather than atmospheric. The plot is pure nonsense, and that's not entirely unexpected, that doesn't make the stupidity and/or grossness of everyone involved any less obnoxious. The '70s-inspired music that came packed in with the grindhouse aesthetic is the only real saving grace, and even at that, there are several tracks ruined by the invasion of the aforementioned dialogue, and I couldn't find a way to skip those tracks in favour of something more listenable. And since I have nothing nice to say about the portrayal and treatment of the female characters, I'll instead say, "nothing."\n\nAs I said, I came into TOTD: Overkill really wanting to like it. I figured I'd be replaying all the levels on the highest difficulty, showing off my digital dexterity, downloading new dictionaries, maybe going through it co-op, too. Instead, I hit Delete Local Content the minute the campaign reached its mercifully swift end. TOTD: Overkill was neither fun nor funny, and I can't find a single compelling reason to recommend it. Go play the original instead.","December 7, 2013","false","3.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

For those of you who have not, it's a shoot-em-up, but rather than a gun (or a mouse pointer) you type words to kill the zombie/mutants.\n\nIt's a decent game, yeah, but still, not that much engaging in terms of the typing, just, spam the words, mash the keyboard, wazoom, bang, zap, kill dem zombies. If you have played the first ToTD, it's definitely superior in terms of how much more engaging the gameplay was (e.g. those question prompts, they were gone, somewhat, at least in the levels that I have completed). So killing those bosses is just a matter of typing accurately and typing fast. I could've sworn that the level design seemed to be more linear and doesn't offer that much of a branching paths as well.\n\nBut to say that this is a bad game would be a lie, it's decent, but nowhere near as good as the first.

(only the final one was a variation from the rest of the game, and you could beat it by just hammering on all keys at once)\n\nCompared to the other Typing of the Dead game, this one seemed to be all about style instead of substance.

It seems like a nice way to teach kids words and spelling (assuming you can ignore the gore and blood involved in the process).\n\nAt its base the game consists of two gameplay modes. The first is where you type random words attached to mutant zombies in order to kill them. The second mode is more akin to the old arcade game machines where enemies appear on-screen and you aim the gun to shot (meaning you can't move, you just shot what appears when it appears). Both modes can be adjusted for its difficulty levels (longer-harder words and etc).\n\nThe story and mood of the game is set as a 1970's B-movie and while cliched (as expected) is quite entertaining. To add a little spice, you can pick various collectibles scattered throughout the different levels in the form of a comic-book, concept art, posters, audio tracks and 3d character models. Also, in case you have become bored with the choice of words present there are several dictionary-themed DLCs you can buy, ranging from movies and novellas to just plain filth.\n\nBe advised though, at first the game seemed to have bug with Steam overlay. For some reason it got resolved by itself the next day (maybe a restart after installation of game/redist was in order, but it didn't ask for one). There were also mentions of black-screen issues (I think it got fixed) on the game forum so might wanna check that beforehand.\n\nLong story short, get it. Even just as a guilty pleasure for the B-movie story if not for the unique mechanics.","September 10, 2014","true","4.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The only shooters I had really played are FPSes like Doom and Painkiller, which of course let you choose your own path through a level.\n\nI was intrigued by the concept from the first time I read about it: A shooter that allows you to literally type your foes into submission.  I wasn't totally sure what to expect and was somewhat skeptical when I first started playing, but the end result is actually a lot of fun.  The designers did a great job of adapting such shooter mechanics to the keyboard, giving each enemy you encounter a series of "kill words" that you must type correctly to defeat your opponent.  The color of the border around the word or phrase to be typed determines that enemy's level of threat.  A green border suggests that the enemy poses little threat, whereas a red border means imminent danger.\n\nFor the most part, the mechanics work very well.  As you type a word correctly, the letters fade out, and you can both hear and see gunshots striking the targeted opponent.  If you need to switch to another target, a quick tap of Backspace cancels the word you were typing completely, allowing to start typing the word of the new target.  Gratefully, you can make a mistake in typing without starting a word or phrase over again unless you turn on Hardcore mode after beating the game once.  You can also make a mistake without losing your combo point bonus.  The designers were respectful of players who may be somewhat frantic in their typing first starting out so as not to cause frustration for making mistakes, and there are three difficulty levels to make it fun for everyone.  Even the boss fights have for the most part been well adapted to this format, with series of words and phrases used to not only injure the boss, but also to do things like destroy projectiles, interrupt attacks, and dodge out of the way of an oncoming charge.  The game also gives you fun stats after each level, such as your overall accuracy, number of perfect words, and longest combo.  You're also given a letter ranking based on your overall performance; can you earn an "A" on every course?  That's what I'm working on now.\n\nOf course, some adjustments had to be made from the normal shooting format.  Weapon power-ups are not available, for example.  You don't earn cash for stronger weapons, and there are no grenades or cash pick-ups present.  This doesn't have much of an impact, however, as you'll be having too much fun typing out the crazy kill words and expressions the game throws at you.  One fault I did have is with picking up items such as Med-Kits and collectibles.  There's only a very brief tutorial in the first level to outline the use of the Tab key to nab such items, and it appears to be completely omitted from the instruction manual.  A few deaths I suffered during my initial playthrough could have been eliminated had this been made more clear.\n\nI honestly didn't have very much to complain about with this game.  My biggest complaint is with the final battle.  I won't spoil it, but for me, the rules of that battle are completely inane, and I suffered an extremely high number of deaths before winning, in part because I couldn't find a way to inflict much damage or stop oncoming attacks as I did with every other boss.  Let's just say that this battle is much more free-form than the rest of the game.  Additionally, while I found very little in the way of bugs in the game, I do occasionally have sound effects and voices drop out completely, especially when repelling the attacks of mutants who grapple with your character to try and bite you.\n\nMy only other gripe with the game is with the constant profanity.  Yes, I realize this is a game primarily designed to shock and possibly offend, and the characters cursing was not surprising.  The LEVEL of profanity, however, is something new to me; Washington and Varla Guns especially cannot say the "F" word enough throughout this game, and I found such overuse of profanity a little too gratuitous, and it also detracts from the overall narrative.  In some places, it works, such as during the ending when Washington's personality starts to rub off on Agent G.  Other times, I kept thinking that the writers could have given them SOMETHING else to say.\n\nIn other areas, however, the presentation hits the mark.  There's some excellent and clever alliteration by the narrator in the cutscenes, which are basically presented like horror movie trailers, and this gives an interesting new take on the traditional cutscene format.  The graphics are well detailed, and some of the bosses especially are truly grotesque and imaginative in their design.\n\nAs a bonus treat, the original The House of the Dead: Overkill is included with this game as well, utilizing either the mouse or a controller to aim your weapons at the mutant hordes.  You have full grenade support here and a full complement of weapon upgrades to purchase as the game progresses.  Your weapon selection is critical in some stages and can either give you a boost fighting a boss or render you completely ineffective.  I found the mouse controls to be very responsive and this version of the game to be fun, though the typist in me almost prefers that version.  This is simply a matter of taste, however, and being able to play both games in one release is a great decision by the designers and lets everyone play however they want.  One side note: The final boss was MUCH easier in this mode, and I beat it the first time without dying in this mode.\n\nSo the final verdict is that this game is a lot of fun.  If you aren't turned off by the constant profanity and enjoy horror games and shoot-em-ups, you are probably going to have a blast.  I would love to see more DLC dictionaries released to incorporate such themes as superheroes, music lyrics, or movies.  The DLC is another smart decision, letting you pick and choose themes that appeal to you for inclusion in the typing aspects of the game; you don't feel like you're purchasing content that should have been included to start with.  Overall, I can find very little wrong with this game, and I highly recommend it as a smart revision on the rail shooter format.\n\n8.5 / 10","December 22, 2013","true","11.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

From a style standpoint the game is a convincing and loving homage to grindhouse flicks and video nasties that left me laughing. Looking at the technical end, the port runs smoothly even on a mobile i3 with integrated video, and the developers have paid particular attention to the control scheme.\n\nThe Typing Of The Dead: Overkill is a prequel to the rest of Sega's lightgun horror(?) series, and it's a very well-made one at that! The series' hallmark corny writing and amazing soundtracks are there as usual, but everything is much more deliberately integrated: In something of a contrast to the rest of the series' style, the homages to classic grindhouse films and B-movies are more obvious and lavish amounts of effort have been put into making the game really seem like something one might see featured along with other modern homages to the genre like Planet Terror or Machete. As a bit of a movie fan, this is a detail I really liked!\n\nMoving on, I mentioned some ingenuity with the control scheme. Though Overkill did not get an arcade release like the rest of the series, the core gameplay is still very much in the vein of Overkill's lightgun-based precursors. This integrated logically enough with the Wii's wiimote and the PS3's sensors, but how does one adapt a game like this for a platform with no good analogue for lightgun controls? Sega opted to simply cut the gordian knot here and change the game to a typing-themed edutainment game! Don't be fooled, though; This is far more entertaining of a typing game than Mavis Beacon Teaches Typing or JumpStart Racer. You'll find yourself blowing away scads of undead abominations by typing out a variety of amusingly absurd phrases. This is a time-tested approach on Sega's part: PC versions of previous House Of The Dead games were handled in a similar manner, though it seems like the boss fights were implemented in a more varied way with past releases.\n\nFor those who would rather not fight their way to victory through stenanography, a mouse-and-keyboard based mode that foregoes the typing in favor of more lightgun-ish gameplay is still there. as of my writing this review, though, I have not been able to take that mode for a spin yet.","December 22, 2013","true","8.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
