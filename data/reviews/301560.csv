This is not a walking simulator\n- The "noir" look works, most of the time\n- Bug-free, for the most part\n\nThe Bad:\n- Lots of aliasing.\n- Low poly models, and some poor animation work here and there\n- Save system is a good idea horribly executed. You will lose some progress here and there.\n- AI is unpredictable in a bad way. Plenty of cheap deaths waiting for you\n- Fixed camera angles make for hit-and-miss\n- Predictable ending\n- Limited resources can be aggrivating if you're stuck\n- One or two lame puzzles\n- Sluggish opening act throws the pacing off a bit.\n- Unskipabble cutscenes\n\nOverall, if you're a fan of Resident Evil 1, it's hard not to recommend this game. It has a lot of great ideas, is pretty scary at times, and moves the player along at a nice pace. The price is great for the content that is here. Not a ton of replayability, but plenty of achievements for those who care. This could have been a lot better visually if there had been a decent anti-aliasing solution in place, but it doesn't really hold the game back that much.\n\nBe prepared to experience a few cheap deaths, and lose a little progress (it's only really annoying when it happens too long after a save, or after a longer cutscene). Other than that, this is an excellent peice of entertainment for fans of the genre, who want to see it with a noir bent. Dark, brooding, creepy and very fun.\n\nI don't really want to cover the story here, because that's part of the fun of playing the game. I will say I didn't find it to be the main attraction of the game; the game runs quite well on inertia -- exploring the environment, opening up new areas, solving puzzles and of course dealing with all the creepy things sprinkled about gives more than enough reason to spend time in this world. Mise en scene is high, and while I found the written material (books, letters, etc) to be written very well, the core storyline is not hugely intruiging. Your mileage may vary. Short version: You go into a house. Bad stuff happens.\n\nScore: Buy it.","March 4, 2015","true","5.5"," 144 of 154 people (94%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","94","144","154","7","0"

I peer into the streets looking for a little fun, but the sight hits me like a Mack Truck full of garbage:  Boss Activision has the city tonight.  A hundred Call of Duty hatchet men; the gunfire's so thick you'd barely be able to see the movie tie-ins pimping their wares if they didn't swarm like the bugs under a June streetlight.  Distinguished old names walk with 'em, but I shake my head in disgust.  I see the bruises and I know old man Activision already bought their souls.\n\nCrows will come to eat Activision's buffet.  But me?  I just pour myself a glass of the hard stuff.  That's when she comes through my door: all black dress and ivory skin like something out of an old movie or a graphic novel.  Looks to kill for.  The whisky burns my guts like a lit molotov and I know I'm going to play this game.  She says she's got a job for me, "survival horror just like the good old days."  I take another drink and think to myself,  good old days or bad hard times?   I ask for her name and she tells me through a sly smile, "White Night."\n\nAnother hard night in Steam Town.\n\nBefore you wretch at the prospect of another horror game on Steam, know that White Night is pretty cool.  Okay, so it's got a lot of questionable gameplay elements we knew weren't very good in 1996, a story that's handicapped by its reliance on cliche, and the old cardinal sin of scrapping the visual-interactive medium to tell a story through document collection.  Wait!  Don't leave yet!  You'll notice I still gave this one a thumbs up.  And it's not even a half-hearted "this game is inoffensive but completely mediocre, so my thumb is really dead center but I'm in a good mood today" thumbs up.\n\nWhite Night opens up with a sequence where you control a period 1930's car driving down an empty New England road in the middle of the night.  Your headlights illuminate billboards along the road with the game's credits while a mournful jazz song plays.  Something like this tells me the developers made something special and they know it.  It sets the tone for a detective horror story with a 1930's noir style with aplomb and lets you really drink in the game's visual aesthetic.\n\nBreathe in.  Exhale.  This game rules atmosphere and it doesn't let up after that strong intro.  The main character peppers his inner monologue with metaphors as colorful as the game is monochrome.  His lines are read with the steady sort of grim determination you'd expect from a noir hero.  The fixed camera angles work artistically, if not necessarily gameplay-wise, with each area having strong framing that lends to the comic-book feel.  The rooms of the mansion the game is set in couldn't do a better job of conveying an increasing feeling of decay and confinement - motifs central to the story - supported by the Depression-era setting.  And the collectible documents bring forth all the history and insanity you need to tie the package together.  It's good.  Damn good.\n\nAs a story, though, White Night has some pretty damning weaknesses.  I've already mentioned that it relies on a cliche.  I saw the obligatory twist coming before I was an hour in, less than halfway done exploring the first floor.  And the game did disappoint by doing exactly what I expected.  Seeing where the game was going so early, took a good chunk of the magic out of it for me.  Yeah, the game's tone was strong enough to sock me through the plate-glass window of my imagination, but I didn't tell it to stop!\n\nWhite Night is a ghost story and the ghosts as antagonists really lack the sort of visceral weight I want from a noir thriller.  Seeing my guy swarmed by flailing ghosts just doesn't have the impact of knowing he could end up with his skull caved in by a blunt object.  In fact, the occult elements of the story really fall flat (not unlike a skull caved in by a blunt object).  There's a lot of metaphysical B.S. involving alchemy that clashes with the very believable letters and diary entries.  A Depression-era noir thriller could definitely make good use of occult motifs, but here I think they mostly serve to disconnect the story from the gritty tone the game set up so well.\n\nEven though story and atmosphere are where it's at for a game like this, let's talk gameplay before you guys turn to hard drinking and fistfighting just to get some action in.  White Night has stolen its clothes from Resident Evil and Silent Hill, if not quite gone so far as to disembowel them and wear their skin.  I don't need to tell you guys about tank controls and fixed camera angles.  This game's got them and has all the gameplay problems associated with them.  You'll experience cheap deaths and confusion from blind angles and getting turned around between screens, make no mistake.\n\nThe game doesn't really have combat, unlike its predecessors.  Instead, your main resource is matches, which allow you to explore the dark areas of the house without mysteriously dying.  Interestingly, the matches behave a bit like real matches in that you might randomly get a dud.  Combine this with fixed save points and White Night makes safety an uncertain proposition, which is good for horror.  However, it can quickly get frustrating if you have to redo long sequences between checkpoints or go running back to refill your small supply of matches because you got a bunch of duds in a row.\n\nMatch light won't kill or even fend off the ghosts that can instantly kill you, only switching on electric lights will do the job.  Once again this can make things tense, or it can be very frustrating when you have to run a gauntlet of ghosts randomly moving around in the dark.  Yeah, the stakes have been raised, but during these sequences I died so many times trying to navigate them, that I just ended up getting irritated by the futility of it rather than horrified.  It's also worth noting that you can't run past any ghost.  Ghosts meant to block your way until you solve a puzzle will block your way until you solve a puzzle and it's not often clear which ghosts are which.\n\nSo the gameplay walks a razor's edge between tension and frustration.  That razor's edge cuts impressively when it works, but when you're juggling it among so many balls, your balls won't feel good when it misses.  And I found it to be pretty hit-or-miss.\n\nPuzzle solving is about what you'd expect from a game with White Night's roots.  There's a lot of find-odd-shaped-key-for-door puzzles, as well as some weird contraption based puzzles that have that contrived "puzzle" feel.  The former have the problem of being too straightforward and the latter tend toward the cryptic, even if there are far fewer of them.  The thing to take away from this is that it isn't a puzzle game.  It's a horror game.\n\nAlright, after all that why do I still recommend White Night?  Can I really sell it to you on the art style alone if it has so many weaknesses?  Damn skippy, I can!  But more importantly, White Night does something great.  Yeah, you'll be brought in by janky, nostalgic controls and those crisp black and white graphics (which could admittedly use better anti-aliasing), but what White Night does best is make you feel like you're an investigator using a hard nose for secrets to fight back the dark.  It does this with its atmosphere and its superlative pacing.  From staggering into a mysterious mansion, to meeting your first ghost with little fanfare, to pressing forward to the darker and more sinister sections of the mansion; from ground floor, to top floor, attic, and basement; White Night keeps getting darker and more dangerous.  It's not a great story, no.  But it's very well told.  It stood out like a muzzle flash in a pitch black room during the Activision Weekend when I picked it up.  I definitely recommend you give it a try if horror is your bag and it's on sale.  For fifteen bucks, though?  Maybe wait.","June 1, 2015","true","11.5"," 39 of 41 people (95%) found this review helpful 20 people found this review funny","95","39","41","20","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Corpekata/recommended/301560/","Corpekata","Corpekata","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Corpekata/","2463 products in account","Game seems to be going a bit under the radar so thought I'd shed some light. White Night is a horrorish adventure game with a minimalist art style, almost all in black and white. Everything in the game is pure darkness unless illuminated by a light source, and so it often creates scenes oozing with style, especially when couples with the fixes camera angles.\n\nWhile the game has some obvious survival horror roots, it is mainly an adventure game, never really involving any sort of combat. The game is set in a decrepit mansion evoking the likes of Resident Evil and Alone in the Dark, but playing out a bit more like Silent Hill. Lighting is one of the main puzzle mechanics. You need light to explore and interact with the house, so you need to manage matches so you don't run out. Spending too much time in the dark or running into one of the residents will not end well. The puzzles often involve either lighting up areas to force enemies away (they can't stand electric light) so you can progress or lighting area so you can perform an action that would be too hard in the dark. There are also some traditional "mansion owned by loonies" types of esoteric puzzles to solve, though they are probably a bit on the easy side.\n\nThe game's story is a bit bare bones. The main character is driving and swerves his car to avoid hitting a ghostly woman and from there enters the creepy mansion of the Verner family and is stuck investigating their secrets. From there there's not a ton of meat, with the vast majority of the story being fleshed out with journals to read that are dropped like every 10 feet. Some of these have some questionable translation. Even still, the game has some pretty obvious plot turns and twists that everyone will guess an hour in, which can be frustrating to watch the game treat as big deals later.\n\nWhere the game excels in is atmosphere. The enemies you face are consistently creepy and rarely get to be a chore like in a like of similar games. Some great sound design. Not reliant on jump scares, though there's a couple good ones, and the way it treats the enemies with never really being in focus is unsettling. When you take back an area of the house by turning on the lights it feels like a real accomplishment. The game does have a few cheap deaths from the fixed camera angles if you're unlucky. If you get stuck on a puzzle too it can be easy to run out of matches and really screw yourself, though I only came close to this once so I imagine it won't be an issue for many.\n\nGame lasted me 5-6 hours and should be roughly the same for most. It's not a game I'd shout from the rooftops about but it's a good little entry if you're looking for something creepy. Good first outing, will look forward to seeing what they can do with a bigger budget and maybe better translators.","March 6, 2015","true","6.1"," 31 of 33 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","31","33","0","0"

I'm familiar with the noir style of dialogue, but in White Night I found it very hard to take anything William said seriously. He would spout random, weird descriptions of things that were just downright silly and instead of being afraid I was sitting there laughing. Combine that with the running mechanic while changing camera views and you've got yourself something closer to Goat Simulator in tone.","January 19","false","2.0"," 47 of 67 people (70%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","70","47","67","5","0"

Smithfield","http://steamcommunity.com/id/smithfield/","1073 products in account","ENEarly impressions : v. 0 -FR en dessous...White Night story’s unfolds in a manor which appears to be completely cut off. Your character finds himself there without really understanding how. It’s the 30’s, times appear to be very troubled and unsure, somehow it feels like cities and civilization are collapsing in the distance. After first lines of voice-over, you can already understand how tainted you are, the fatality, the alcohol…\n\nThe atmosphere at the very beginning of the game is Noire (obviously), warm vocal jazz, deep voice of narrator speaking… Horror part comes far later and to speak the truth White Night events call to my mind a Noire mixed with supranatural plot rather than a classical survival horror.\n\nAdventure deeply reminds me of the original Resident Evil, one unique location (the manor), levels and rooms feel like a maze, previous scene wasd’s subjective control, the static camera which automatically switch point of view also does a great job. Once inside you’re locked in, you got there hoping for help but you’ll find questions and puzzle instead.\n\nLike in Amnesia, the light is your friend, stay in the dark for too long and you’ll die, out of matches, death it is. If resident evil used typewriter for saving your progress, you’ll need in this game to sleep in coach and armchair.\nYou have only one save game and you don’t get to control it.\nBeside of staying enlightened, you walk from room to room trying to find keys, useful items, or any clue that could explain what’s going on in the manor, you have one ally, the gost of a singer who used to live there.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=402259203\nMonsters are like the one in Mamas' movie, slender, silent, hidden in darker area. Most of the times it’s  “jump scare” that you’ll experience rather than gloomy and evil mood. Many (many) objects await you to understand more about the plot: newspaper excerpts, family’s member journal and macabre vintage photographs. As you progress visited rooms get debated by the ghost’s wrath.\nNote that most of the time it’s an hide’n seek gameplay since you can't kill ghost with your basic matches.\nIf you're looking for more similar stories I'd recoomend this movie (actually a set of shorts film). Among others, Charles Burns is featured http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0792986/ .\n\nTechnically: only 2 graphics option (vsync/aliasing) as well as non standard resolution (but no hotsampling allowed). The game displays a non deactivable film grain. A very strange grain actually, it cripples the purity of black and white visual.\nKeyboard can be remap (default key for sprint is U… if someone has any explanations about such choice I’m curious to know it).

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bastwood/recommended/301560/","bastwood","Bastwood","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bastwood/","689 products in account","A throwback to the roots of 3D survival horror. Channeling the 1992 Infogrames classic "Alone in the Dark", White Night shares many aspects of the original: Mostly puzzle-driven gameplay with a large, derelict mansion to explore; Crooked, static camera angles Sam Raimi himself would be proud of, and a large part of the story told via books and diary entries. Both games even feature the same Camille Saint-Saëns' composition - A nice little touch.\n\nNot being bound by 90's technology, White Night additionally handles exposition by integrating an ongoing vocal narration. Listening to the somber musings of the protagonist sink in the film noir aesthetic, a goal that is visually even more evident: Everything is presented in black & white, either illuminated by a flickering matchstick or shrouded in ever-unfolding nocturnal shadows.\n\nFinding ways to produce even the tiniest gleam of light to fight back the gloom requires careful observation and thought, since you're otherwise weaponless against the void and its spawn. When cornered, running away is the only option. To make matters even more dire, you're always burning through your stack of matches, a valuable commodity that the game carefully administers to keep up tension.\n\nWhile White Night is oozing with stylistic charm, in some ways it clings perhaps a bit too closely to twenty-year old design choices; Probably enough so to make most modern gamers squirm in discomfort. You die in one hit. You run out of matches, you're dead. The camera angles sometimes make navigation way harder, especially in high-stress situations.\n\nThe worst offender, however, is the obnoxiously bad checkpoint system. Replaying through sizable chunks of puzzles is a common occurrence, since there simply aren't enough savepoints between some scene transitions. I understand that a certain sense of stinginess in saving possibilities is required in a survival horror game, but come the hell on - Don't make me watch story scenes multiple times just because you've set up a murderous wraith around the next corner right after it.\n\nAnyhow, I was brought up on way more vicious stuff so in the end I overcame, but I can easily imagine folks of a less forgiving mental disposition towards games attempting to screw them over to just keel over and capitulate way before the slender lady sings. As the end credits rolled, I walked away from White Night feeling that here's a game that was created exactly for people like me - A fleeting validation that maybe my thirty plus years of gaming haven't been a total waste of time. Some people do still remember.\n\nNext time, also bring back the Cthulhu mythos.","March 9, 2015","true","7.2"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","12","13","0","0"

The contrast of the white and black really makes things more tense than most spooky games. I feel like these devs are really big Silent Hill fans, as they take a lot of cues from the series: the helplessness, the atmosphere, and also the technical issues.\n\nThis has a weird control issue; when you move from one camera angle to another, the direction you are pressing sends you into wherever that direction is as opposed to the direction you are going (I hope that makes sense). This is INFURIATING when I'm trying to run away from a ghost and the camera angle changes and I run right back into the ghost.\n\nHonestly, that's the only really bad thing about this game so far. I love the Depression-era setting (which no one does and I appreciate), the spooky mansion, and the use of light and darkness as a gameplay mechanic.\n\nADDENDUM (after actually beating it): the controls are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ frustrating. So. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Frustrating. It's like tank controls but without the precision.\n\nThe game's puzzles are pretty subtle throughout the game; you just have to get this thing to put in that thing to unlock that door. The last 2 chapters just go straight up Silent Hill puzzles, with matching pictograms and ♥♥♥♥. I think it's a weird progression.\n\nOverall, I'm disappointed. I could see the ending coming a mile away. There's a lot of design choices that just bug me (especially with how you play the ending, you'll see). I would compare this to Murdered: Soul Suspect, in that it's a great idea with a lot of gameplay design decisions that bring it down.

This isn't a real biggie, though, considering that there's so few controls that redoing them takes no more than ten seconds of your time, each time, once you get the hang of it.  Then there's the SAVE system...mostly excellent...hell, almost inspired (you rest in an armchair, but first have to ensure you shed enough light on said chair to do so safely!)...but every now and then, you encounter one of those godawful moments of shithouse game design where you go back literally MINUTES of gameplay, having to redo bits you've done a thousand times before, just to get up to that one fateful bit which keeps snuffing you.  An absolute ♥♥♥♥ing PET HATE of mine, I'm afraid.  But wait, it gets worse...\n\nFor me at least, the game fell into a habit of automatically RESTARTING itself straight after I exit it.

The save system is trash and the AI is sporadic as all hell, meaning sometimes you'll breeze by the scary ghosts and other times they will trap you against your objective for an insta-death. And because your character isn't immune while interacting with the environment (even for plot necessary events), this means the ghosts have a major one-up on you, meaning cheap deaths galore. I write this review out of rage having gotten trapped about halfway through the game on an especially cheap section after you access the secret wardrobe from the Narnia books, so understand why I sound a bit heated.\n\nOn a more rational note, the art style is really cool, and the black and white noir aspect is really embraced in the gameplay. The plot is good and a bit darker (no pun intended) than White Night originally lets on, and overall it would've been a great two hour, five dollar indie adventure. But for the slow, plodding and monotenous back-track-filled, lackluster save system, cheap AI ridden game that it is, I can't recommend it.","May 17, 2015","false","3.5"," 16 of 24 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","16","24","2","0"

And the reason I didn't want those messages was because I was recording footage for the video you should hopefully be able to see below.\n\nAnyway, onto the important stuff and for that matter the rather straight to the point stuff. For $15, White Night is a very good horror adventure. But before I explain why I'm going to list its downfalls, and it does have many. The game is about 5-6 hours long with practically no replayabilty, has long initial loading times and a frustrating array of adevnture-style puzzles that depend on luck to solve and that progresssion revolves around. Also, the theme of the Great Depression feels tacked on and not given enough focus to be important, the movement animations look clumsy at particular moments, and hovering over and selecting items can be very finnicky.\n\nI think it is important to be aware of all of this before you make a purchase decision, but I'll also stress that you don't dismiss White Night because you read something above that you figure will annoy you. This is because a lot of White Night's problems are irrelevant to White Night's main experience. The game is primarily an atmospheric adventure that runs on your adrenalin and nerves. It strips of you of any power, immerses you in the dark shadows and makes you feel entirely helpless. This makes the player constantly anxious and expecant and I think this state of being the game generates can be likened to the sort in the original Clock Tower. And in this state you don't really care about a lot of this game's imperfections. Well, at least I didn't; I was really too absorbed and on edge to notice or care.\n\nSo yeah, I encourage you to buy White Night. Even just to expereince it because I find that not many horror games execute tone and suspense quite as well as White Night. And if you want more of my opinion of White Night I have a full review video below.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2HjDQj-crA\n\nThanks","March 13, 2015","true","1.2"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/audeez/recommended/301560/","audeez","Audeez","http://steamcommunity.com/id/audeez/","297 products in account","Set during the tail end of the Great Depression, White Night is a stylistic thriller where the contrasts of light and dark are more than just window dressing. Playing very much like Amnesia: The Dark Descent, but with the camera and controls of the early Resident Evil games, White Night begins when you crash your car after swerving to miss a woman in the road while coming home from the bar one night. You follow the woman into a nearby mansion in search help, only to become sucked into a mystery whose secrets are as dark as the night itself.\n\nSay what you will about the Resident Evil style controls, while the've always had their flaws, White Night seems to recognize this and does a decent job of making sure that changing camera angles don't hamper movement too much. Most of the game involves your searching for keys and other items needed to progress through the mansion while reading various diaries and newspaper articles that advance the narrative along the way. The puzzles for the most part are simple enough given either a little bit of thought or a little trial and error and the mechanics of light and shadow that often accompany them never feel gimicky or too out of place. The enemies are usually just another puzzle themselves, living obstacles that can be vanquished by the light. Visually the game's high contrast style is executed perfectly, though I felt the character models were lower poly than they could have been. The anti-aliasing could have been stronger also, as the high contrast really highlights the effect.\n\nThe sound is excellent, from the music to the foley, creating a consistent mood thoughout. The voice acting as well is excellent, though the dialog and portions of the writing suffer a bit. This may just be due to English not being the developer's native language however. In addition to the narrative of the protagonist, the woman, and the mansion's owners, there also seems to be some attempt at subtext or metaphor regarding capitalism and the downfall of the American dream, but it gets lost in the mix and regardless of its Gatsby-esque  intentions, feels a little half-formed.\n\nIf you're a fan of narrative adventure games like Amnesia, Gone Home, or Among the Sleep and you're looking for something similar with lots of style and a noir setting, then I definitely recommend White Night. It has a few flaws here and there, but its nothing that detracted from my enjoyment of the game.","March 8, 2015","true","5.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

This game made me feel consistently uneasy, mainly because the lack of light in various aspects made the brain wonder rather than be underwhelmed by monsters/ghosts/enemies that could be identified.\n\nSome notes:\n\n- Even as a Black and White game, this game does require a pretty decent graphics card.\n\n- Music and sound effects are excellent but need earphones to really stand above and beyond.\n\n- The camera angle system is good usually but has severe limitations when running away / trying to dodge various apperitions, such as due to camera angle changes at certain points I'd be running far forward and then immediately backwards again, and if the camera angle changed again I would be running back towards and into the apperiton that was chasing me.\n\nOverall while not perfect, this is a very good game and well worth exploring. Surprisingly creepy and unsettling rather than jump-out-your-skin horror.\n\nNOTES:\nUpdated, there are a few frustrating bugs in the works, Crashes to Desktop and/or unable to escape apperitions.

It's an interesting setting and art style for this genre which surprisingly holds up the whole way through and doesn't feel "gimmicky" at any point while working it's mechanics into the art style in interesting ways. The game is more of an adventure title, as exploration, puzzle solving, and interaction with the environment takes precedence over the "survival" aspects as you have no inventory beyond what is on hand at the time and your stock of matches.\n\nLater in the game, the "threat" can get a bit annoying and throws off the pacing of what is otherwise a creepy methodical matchlit expedition through the lives of the Vesper family, but not so much that it ruins the experience. Some people might be put off by the manual save system, but the game tends to be relatively fair about placement, and there is usual a safe place to save before any major event that might cause you to reset.\n\nUltimately, it was a pretty enjoyable experience, and if you find yourself drawn in by the mood and style from any trailers or screenshots you might have seen, it's probably a safe bet to pick up as it maintains that more or less throughout the experience.","March 6, 2015","true","6.1"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

But unexpectedly, the other end is a mysterious man, proved to be uncomfortable with the presence of strangers in the house. Door suddenly closed down ... "\n\nI did not take a second to realize that its not supposed to be looking for something here. No way back, you will have to continue to go deeper to discover all the secrets are hidden, and above all to survive the supernatural.\n\nIn the White Night, everything is shown with two dominant color is black and white - symbolizing the light and the dark. Nobody knew what was behind the night, as if in the dark for too long, a force that will come and strangle you. The night will never end, players must constantly seek the light source to illuminate each step waterline\n\nWhite Night gameplay primarily revolves around two types of light sources: mobile and fixed. Mobile light source is the matchbox scattered in the game, lit in a certain period of time to find their way. As for sewing puzzle, White Night require players to find the fixed light source (bulb) to search for clues or banish the ghosts.\n\nSewing puzzle in the game is not too difficult but requires players to pay attention to every detail related to the light source. When you find a lamp but can not turn up, why not try to trace the beginning of the wire to the socket, right?\n\nIn addition, the main character can also find lots of letters, diary sheets or pictures patchy. We not only shed light on the relationship between the family members lived in the house, but sometimes a picture can contain a hint to help players solve puzzles.\n\n- Obsessed! -\n\nThe rotation angle of the game is fixed - like Resident Evil the first - but is actually an improvement.\n\nCameras are placed in extremely dangerous places, and repeatedly shook from side to side. The main factors camera shake made me feel cold spine, like someone was watching him so.\n\nCombine with 2 white - black mixed in White Night world seems very mysterious, very cold, it's hideous.\n\nIf the image of the game cause fear (and excitement), the sound elements are raising experience to White Night haunting tones! English latitude stagnant in my mind, the piano suddenly a bass note. Stunt! The soundtrack pent suspense, panic of players, so as to climax - such as running from the pursuit of the three ghosts - both soul and my body wants crushed.\n\n[YOU WILL DISLIKE]\n\n- Still not perfect -\n\nFrom concept to building, White Night are pretty good, but not perfect. The reason I say this because the game still exists some pity.\n\nFirstly, the use of fixed camera angles in the game is a double-edged sword. I do not deny that it has helped improve the experience of horror. But it also caused a lot inhibitors for me, especially when the ghost "chase". But then the player must quickly find its way toward the light, however when running to a different angle, it is likely you will accidentally press runs contrary to the ghost, some real bad.\n\nSecondly, the ghost of the first White Night "meeting" can I startled, but then the more I see the more of them that "lifeless ghost" so!\nIndeed, the ghosts will make players disappointed, they are programmed just to walk around certain areas and attacking players in front of them (or in very close).\n\nAlthough the game does not take the course of action, but I still wish to experience the feeling of fear of cutting heart when the ghosts constantly prowling in the dark character.\n\n[SUMMARY]\n\nWhite Night brings a true horror experience, when a player continually suppressed, causing fear and obsession, even if you close the machine to sleep. Skipping a few small defects, White Night is still a good horror game for the weak-heart-not challenge myself every night.","April 17, 2015","true","4.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The game does more than enough differently within the horror genre to stand out...the eyecatching stylised black and white art style, the noir setting, the light and shade puzzles, the actual main game mechanics of matches / electric lamps, the stealth games of cat and mouse with the ghosts, the novel system of saving involving illuminated couches, on top of all that it's hugely atmospheric....everything that it brings to the genre is high quality, some of it even feels fresh.\n\nThe real standout point however is the story. It starts out initially leaving you disorientated, with very little to go on, almost goes into a lull, then the power in the house goes down and with it the relative safety and benefits of the electric lighting, matches take on the same importance as air, ghosts are round every corner. Through the collectible snippets / photos / journals and story progression it builds to a finish that ends with an absolute thump and is about as dark as dark gets.","February 14","true","6.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The story line is really interesting as well as the art, but there were a lot of bugs.\n\nSome of the bugs I noticed:\n\n1) When you quit the game, it would automatically restart and launch again\n2) The camera would stop following you and would take multiple resets or dying before it would start following you again\n3) The camera will just freeze sometimes and you won't be able to leave a room\n4) Cut scenes and using stairs would sometimes overlap so you'd miss out on part of the cut scene\n\nThe story line is really brilliant, up until the end. The end was a little cliched and predictable. But the gathering up of the story pieces as you go was interesting. I think it would make an interesting film if they ever turned it into one.\n\nThe save process was infuriating and made it hard to get through certain aspects of the game. You could go a LONG time without saving, which meant if you died or ran out of matches, you lost 30-45 minutes of game time.\n\nA lot of aspects of the game I found impossible without a walkthrough. Just not very intuitive, I wanted to get all of the achievments but some were just too time specific for me like playing the whole game in 1 night, and beating it during a full moon. Though I followed a walkthrough it still seems like I missed picking up some diary entries etc.\n\nThe diaries and notes you get along the way are interesting but also pretty wordy and convuluded.\n\nThe music was lovely.\n\nI played this with a Steam controlled and overall it ported really well and I found made the movements easier.\n\nI think experienced gamers will find this game a little harder than they expect, but not because it's actually difficult, just that it's not as intuititve and the save process is so annoying. THere are a few levels that every walkthrough will tell you are just infuriating because it's basically so easy to die you just gotta play it over and over and it comes down to dumb luck and where the apparations spawn.\n\nStill worth the play, but I wont be replaying to get my missed achievements.","April 24","true","8.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I usually don't post reviews but felt it was neccesary for White Night.\nTo be honest there wasn't much I liked about the game, I love horror, mystery games but there was something about this that just didn't pull me in.\nWhat made this game really hard to play was it's poor saving feature. Many times too often svaes are too far in between. You're required to find certain chains that are lit up with light to sit in and save which can easily be missed.\nThe camera angles are similar to old resident Evil games and The Walking Dead game. I found it very frustrating at times since when you enter a room you have to quickly switch directions otherwise you'll be running back and forth between the same rooms. Very easy is to to loose your sense of direction due to the art style and the mechanics of the camera.\nMy two main issues with this title are the rediculous cheap deaths, and the matches. Although it isn't totally hard to find matches they don't last and often times you'll pull out a match and it wont light thus wasting it. I understand the aim for realism here but if they really wanted to be real you should be able to carry more than 12 matches. Overall I couldn't finish this game as I found it incredibly annoying.\n","October 20, 2015","false","7.9"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

The story is also interesting, I'd have loved to find out more.\n\nHowever, very ♥♥♥♥♥♥ controls and camera angle synergy, no excuse for that, especially when you have insta-kill enemies. And the pitch black art style sometimes kicks itself in the ♥♥♥, well alongside with the camera probably. There are just sections where you have no chance seeing something just by looking with your match. That's very annoying, when you want to find all the collectibles, it'too ♥♥♥♥ing nitpicky, you not seeing even with a light on is very obstructive if you're supposed to collect dozens of books and ♥♥♥♥ in just a few rooms, because those give insight to the story..\n\nIf only you could work around the crappy controls and camera synergy without hair pulling you would have a nice game, but since being able to control your character properly is essential to enjoy a game it didn't work for me.

Everything that it does from the graphics, to the voiceovers builds on that suspenseful feeling. It's a good game.\n\nVideo Review:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAozMD-CtIw&feature=youtu.be\n\nWhat is it?\n\nWhite Night is a Noir-horror adventure game. The game plays similarly to a Telltale game, where the player wanders around a place looking at things and trying to solve various puzzles. The main difference between this and a Telltale game is that White Night uses only the keyboard to play (no point and click) and there are no quick-time events (as far as I've seen. Noir and horror are not two genres that expected to see put together. After this game it seems like a no brainer, but beforehand I wouldn't have thought that the level-headed nature of Noir would mix with the superstitions of a horror game. I'm glad I was wrong.\n\nThe graphics are the first thing that will come to most peoples mind when they see this. The game is entirely black and white except for the few sources of light that you will find throughout the game. This adds significantly to the tension of the game. Most of the time, you will move around using match-light. When that goes out, there is definitely a feeling of dread. You know that there is something, somewhere that is after you. What if it's right behind you and you just don't know it yet? Beyond that, I never find myself wishing it was in color. I do sometimes dread the lack of color, because perhaps if there was a speck of color outside of my tiny match flame, then the world might not seem so sinister.\n\nThe story of the game is conveyed mostly through memoire entries and newspaper clippings. This means that the game will be reading intensive. I don't mind that so much, but I know that there are some people who play games to get away from that sort of thing.\n\nIs the game scary? It is, but it won't try to scare you by throwing things in your face. This game has so far been brilliant at building suspense. Take one moment, for instance. I was plugging in a lamp, because I felt so inclined. As I plugged it in, there was a knock on the door next to me. I knew that there would be something behind it. Beyond that, I knew that I would have to open it. The dread I felt beforehand helped to heighten the fear that I felt as I fled from the wraith (I mean, I had to open the door, I needed to know for sure).\n\nWith all this being said, this game (so far) has not proven to be terribly difficult. The puzzles have been fairly straight forward. That being said, I've only played a little over an hour of the game.\n\nPros:\n\n-An amazing suspenseful atmosphere.\n\n-A go-at-your-own-pace feel. You are limited by the number of matches you can find in the house, but there are a lot of them.\n\n-Vivid and simple graphics that help to create the games suffocating atmosphere.\n\n-So far, the story has been interesting. I want to know what happened to the people who lived in this manner, and that's a good start for a game.\n\n-Simple, non-stressful mechanics. The stress of the game is more situational then mechanics based (like quick-time events).\n\nCons:\n\n-The game can be frightening. That's not a con for everyone, but if you can't take scary games then you should think long and hard about this one.\n\n-If you play on a keyboard you will get the distinct feeling that the game was meant to be played with a controller. I'm pretty sure that that is the case. It doesn't detract much from the game, aside from putting the run button on the awkward U key.\n\nOverall, this game has an amazing atmosphere and an engaging narrative. I'll be playing a lot of this game in the future. I would definitely recommend it at the price of $15.\n\n(By the way, I don't mean to bash Telltale games at all with this review. I love their games. It's just that they are the closest genre to White Night, so it seems second nature to compare them.)","March 4, 2015","true","1.6"," 5 of 18 people (28%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","28","5","18","0","0"

The artstyle is truly something that helps stick this game out from the crowd, and is truly pleasing to the eyes when playing through it since the artstyle was the first thing that made me pay the full price to play this game. Another thing I must say is that the gameplay reminded me of Alone in the Dark and Silent Hill from how the atmosphere was and how the monsters responded though when going through the story, it felt truly like something Silent Hill would be involved with during the first 3. Overall, I would say this game is something that I feel fits the Psychological Horror genre quite well and is something I would have actually seen become a Silent Hill game from how the story went.

The artstyle is truly something that helps stick this game out from the crowd, and is truly pleasing to the eyes when playing through it since the artstyle was the first thing that made me pay the full price to play this game. Another thing I must say is that the gameplay reminded me of Alone in the Dark and Silent Hill from how the atmosphere was and how the monsters responded though when going through the story, it felt truly like something Silent Hill would be involved with during the first 3. Overall, I would say this game is something that I feel fits the Psychological Horror genre quite well and is something I would have actually seen become a Silent Hill game from how the story went. Rating : 90/100","March 24, 2015","true","7.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It plays like a cross between Resident Evil and Outlast set in the 1930's. This is another game that begs to be played at night in the dark with headphones. There's lots of puzzles to solve inside a big spooky haunted mansion and the only defence against the ghosts is light. Most of the rooms in the mansion are really dark and you need to find light switches, breakers, and power outlets to successfully brighten up the mansion and vanquish the ghostly apparations of some broad that died in the house. The story of the game isn't all that great. It's more mystical, depressing nonsense that's been done a hundred times before. The art style of the game is fantastic and mostly really unique. The game is essentially all in black and white with some very minor uses of color every now and then. The game does a good job of setting the spooky atmosphere. Like RE, it uses pre-rendered back grounds, which I liked as not many games go with that style. However, also like RE it's easy to get twisted around when the camera suddenly changes and I died a bunch of times because of it. To navigate the dark areas you get matches. They burn out quickly and you get a limited supply. This mechanic really reminded me of Outlast and the camera batteries. There was only one time when I got down to my final match, but the mechanic does ratchet up the tension as it seems like I was always running low on matches. It was always a nice relief each time I managed to turn on a light. The game is paced mostly well, but about 2/3 of the way through the game it was starting to drag on and sections just seemed like tedious trial and error. Sometimes it seemed like the luck of the draw if I was going to die or not. Ghosts would be blocking the way I needed to go or not for different attempts I made.  The ending sections picked the pace back up again, though. It took me around 7 hours to finish the game. I recommend it.","March 7, 2015","true","9.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The story is rather catchy, even though it is easy to get lost into the different diaries and letters. Issues with the game include the sometimes confusing camera angles (probably deliberate, still annoying) and the fact that the game tries to restart every time you exit (really bothering, not fixed).

If you took the game Killer 7, removed every colour from it except  yellow and allowed for full 3D movement, you would get something like this game. The use of light and darkness was great. The story was really good too. This game made me feel emotions. Happiness, frustration, relief, confusion, sadness and awe. I do have some problems with it though. The shadows/ghosts were sometimes really hard to get around, especially at one point when there's a room full of them, and I wish you were able to carry 20 matches instead of 12. Also, some of the puzzles were slightly confusing. Making me look up a guide to figure out what to do. Some matches going out right as I lit them, forcing me to light another one, was a ♥♥♥♥ move too. Those are just nitpicks though, and I think you should check it out. 8/10, will play again to get all the journal entries and paper scraps scattered throughout the game.","May 17","true","20.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
