"http://steamcommunity.com/id/anapenka/recommended/20900/","anapenka","Matie","http://steamcommunity.com/id/anapenka/","105 products in account","I got this game on a sale for 1.49 EUR and it was the best deal ever, it turned out to be amazing. It's not for everyone however, as it's quite long, you need to pay attention to the story and get used to the clunky combat - you'll either love it or give up in the first few hours.\n\nI started the game to see what it's like, struggled with the fighting, played half an hour until it suddenly crashed and I realised I didn't save the game. I didn't really like what I saw first, but I decided to give it another chance. Fortunately, the dialogues are skippable, so I could continue almost immediately and this time I read the tutorial more attentively and managed to find out how to properly kill enemies. As the story progressed, I got more and more into it and started to enjoy the game very much.\n\n\nGraphics\nEven though the game came out in 2007, it's beautiful. The environments are detailed, colourful and interesting, most places are not just visually but aesthetically pleasing. Heck, even some dark crypts and caves look exquisite here and there due to the nice colours and great lighting.\n\n\nGameplay\nWhen you start the game, you have to choose a style you want to play it in, and you still have the opportunity to change this anytime. You can have an isometric camera or OTS, so you can play point and click style, and also in third person if you want to (I chose the latter). Being inexperienced with RPGs, I played on easy. My character became pretty strong eventually (maybe too strong for this difficulty), yet there still were a few challenging parts to balance that out.\n\nAs you play, you gain XP and level up. While meditating, you can access the skill tree, which looked a bit complicated at first, but it makes perfect sense. Alchemy is pretty useful, especially for bigger fights, I haven't used any bombs though.\n\nThe gameplay is not particularly interesting on its own, the story is what makes it special. Sometimes there's a lot of running back and forth, collecting things, which gets boring after a while. I was very grateful for the few fast travel options we got.\n\nOn the other hand, there are lots of side quests to keep you busy. Some of them are of the general collect-this-and-I-reward-you tpye, and there are more important ones as well. Some side quests enrich the story a lot and have an overall impact on how you experience it, so it's definitely worth completing those.\n\n\nCombat\nIt's doubtless that this is the low point of the game. The first time I saw Geralt grabbing a sword and swinging it around above his head like an idiot, I laughed out loud, I thought it was a bug. (Later though as I applied more talents on the swords, he became a much better fighter.) To evade attacks you need to dodge by pressing one of the direction buttons twice or more times, depending on how responsive it wants to be in the current situation, I had some trouble sometimes when Geralt got cornered. To attack, you need to click on the enemy and do not click again immediately, doing so will cancel the attack. Only click again when the cursor changes, allowing you to do combos if you click in time. It definitely takes some getting used to.\n\nCollect as much information as you can on the enemies you have to face, it's important to read the Journal, especially the pages on Monsters to learn what they're immune to, where they can be found, which fighting styles are efficient against them. It helps you a great deal. The Signs are very useful and fun, too.\n\nThe controls during combat are pretty awkward sometimes, even if I had the right fighting style selected, I couldn't attack or hurt the enemies. I had to switch to another style and then back for it to decide to work again.\n\n\nStory\nAfter the low point, here comes the best part. The story in this game is incredible. It's very detailed, very deep and exciting. The dialogues are filled with humour and deep philosophical thoughts here and there.\n\nThe world is consistent, the characters are likeable and unique, after a while you find yourself caring about many of them. They all respond to your actions and choices. There's quite a number of decisions you have to make that (sometimes pretty heavily) affect the story and your relationship to certain characters. I loved the amount of freedom I had in the game, I was never forced to get in an intimate relationship with any character or play dice, etc. - it's entirely up to the player.\n\nThe way women were portrayed though - boobs, boobs and more boobs. I've seen more boobs in this game than my own. :P Jokes aside, I simply had to play very carefully when others were in the same room with me, because almost every woman you can interact with is um... underdressed. Good for Geralt I guess. ;)\n\nAs you play more and more, the story just drags you in - even if you don't like the combat or the gameplay, it's definitely worth to play this through just for the story alone.\n\n\nAnimation and voices\nThis is something I wasn't entirely pleased with. Yes, it's not a game from today, but the characters often looked very stiff, which is not a good thing when there's a lot of dialogue. Another thing which detracts from the experience is the mediocre voice acting. First I found it very awkward, but got used to it eventually and after a certain point it simply didn't bother me anymore.\n(I kept finding the same character models throughout the game though, now that did annoy me a bit.)\n\n\nMusic and atmosphere\nThe music was pretty great, fast paced and dark when needed, beautiful and calming while exploring beautiful areas. It really spiced some great moments up. Same with the atmosphere, the time of day really sets the mood of some locations, as well as the occasional rain and storms.\nI also loved the art style, there's some gorgeous artwork during storytelling parts.\n\n\nSummary:\n+ nice visuals\n+ amazing story with brilliant dialogues\n+ great music and atmosphere\n\n- combat might be hard to get used to\n- bad animations\n\n\nIt took me 46 hours to finish the adventure and it's become one of my all-time favourite games. If you can get used to the combat and want to take a break from no-brainers, I highly recommend The Witcher, it's going to be an amazing and unforgettable experience.","April 30, 2015","true","50.2"," 833 of 856 people (97%) found this review helpful 62 people found this review funny","97","833","856","62","14"

Like most middle schoolers, I wasn’t very smart and the only thing I really looked for in a game was how many bad guys I could murder. I finished the game and quickly forgot about it. Only after I was in college did I realize to the full extent the awful choices that I had made during my first playthrough of The Witcher. My crimes were beyond description. I killed street dogs and innocent travelers just to loot 2 orens worth of stuff from their corpses. I slept with women and promptly abandoned them to be murdered by angry mobs or overzealous knights. I killed a fellow witcher. I walked away from a chance to have a happy family with a woman who loved me in order to sleep with my sex buddy sorceress who I thought looked hotter. I helped commit mass genocide, murdering dozens of non-humans fighting for freedom.\n\nBy chance I happened to see The Witcher: Enhanced Edition on sale during Steam Summer Sale 2014. I took it as a sign from heaven. Lord Gaben the Redeemer was speaking to me through my computer, offering me a chance to atone for my sins of the first playthrough. Now I could do what I had not done in middle school. I would uphold justice and help the weak. I would be the hero that Vizima needed, but not the one it deserved. And I could do it with 75% off. I clicked buy and my $1.99 ascended to the heavens while the face of Lord Gaben smiled down upon me.","August 28, 2014","true","58.0"," 1,169 of 1,226 people (95%) found this review helpful 428 people found this review funny","95","169","1","428","37"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/recommended/20900/","TeamTom","TeamTom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/","2819 products in account","The Witcher is an action role playing hack and slash game developed by CD Projeckt RED and published by Atari – being released on PC in late 2007. This is the first game in the Witcher Series.\n\nThe gameplay in Witcher a split between focusing on the hack and slash, and the other on the heavy dialogue scenes. The game can be played in one of three camera angles, there are two top down angels, and one over the shoulder view – I mainly used the third person view as it suited the gameplay more than the others.  Combat in this game is something that sometimes receives criticism but I found it to be a nice change from the regular combat you see in RPGs – you have three different styles of attack, a quick, heavy and group attack – each of these attacks have three stages of attack and you have to click at the right time in order to continue your combo of attack. This does feel a little like a QTE, but for me it is disguised well enough that you don’t really notice it. The Witcher also comes equipped with two different main weapons – one sword which deals more damage to monsters, but is less effective against humans, and another weapon which is the opposite. Another major portion of the gameplay is based on alchemy, you will be spending a lot time collecting herbs in order to make an assortment of potions in order to help you progress.  This is one of the first games I have played that your actions really do have a massive impact on how the story flows and concludes. A lot of the dialogue options when conversing with other characters will also affect the story and how that character in particular interacts with the player.\n\nThis game is eight years old now, so you would expect the graphics to be a little on the dated side, however when wracking the resolution up to 4k, the game still has a current gen look to it; whilst some of the textures may be on the lower quality scale still, the open worldness of the game means that you can’t really expect mind blowing graphics at the time of its development.  The game also has some very nice looking special effects, such as water effects.\n\nOn release of Witcher, the game’s voice acting was supposedly one of the worst that has been seen, however the Enhanced Edition of the game, which everyone got who purchased the original version, greatly improves the voice acting to acceptable levels – whilst it is still not the best by today’s standards, every single character in the game is catered for and has a voice to be heard.  The game has a couple of sound tracks that are really iconic too, and the sound effects are all really on par.\n\nWitcher’s plot is one of my all-time favourites – it is very rare that a game is able to completely suck me into the story right from the word go. The game is split in to various chapters, which allows the game to create sub plots whilst also progressing the overall main story line at an acceptable pace. A lot of the quests in Witcher will bear no importance to the main story, and often are there to add an extra layer of depth to the world in which you are in. The immersion levels are sky high in this game as you will find yourself caring greatly for the characters.\n\nThis game comes with three levels of difficulties; Easy, Medium and Hard. I was playing on medium on my run through the game and was still challenged to the point where I had to replay a few parts due to death. Hard mode is seriously for the hard-core RPGers out there; you will need to take full advantage of the alchemy system in the game as most of the more advanced fights will 100% require the use of multiple potions. Your average Joe gamer will get a great amount of enjoyment and challenge from the medium settings though.\n\nWitcher is one of the longest games I have played. Having just finished the whole game with the majority of side quests, and exploring done, it has taken me eighty hours to complete. Although the replay ability in Witcher is quite high given you can change the middle part of the game and outcome quite heavily depending on how you act and play; you would seriously have to be a huge fan to want to be putting eighty hours into another play through. I am very happy with the longevity of the game; you cannot complain about a game this good having a huge amount of content available.\n\nTechnically, the game is sound. I didn’t have any problems running the game at higher resolutions, with a fairly nice selection of graphic options available to optimize your game for your computer.  The game needs to be played with a keyboard and mouse though – there are mods which you can install for controllers but the gameplay really needs a mouse to be completely effective.\n\nIn conclusion, The Witcher Enhanced Edition is easily one of the best games to ever been made and every RPG fan needs to experience it. The low regular price of £6, 99 makes this game an absolute must buy. It has been known to go as low as £1, 39…which you would have to be brain dead to not pick it up for that price. Eighty hours of stellar gameplay and amazing story line, makes The Witcher one of my top 5 games of all time.\n\nTom's Score Card\n1) Stay away\n2) Not Recommended\n3) Only recommended when on sale\n4) Recommended\n5) Highly recommended\n6) This is a must play\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

It's amazing.\n\nFirst off, don't let the first chapter fool you. It starts off really slow. Like, REALLY slow. It can turn a lot of people off. The slow-paced combat at the beginning and a few graphical hitches doesn't help it at all. In fact, it took multiple attempts to try to get into the game because of it, as I felt there were just better games for me to play.\n\nBut, once I got through that first chapter, the game picked up quickly. You encounter unique characters and environments, difficult decisions that aren't just black & white "good versus evil", a great soundtrack, an engaging storyline, and hell, even the combat begins to show a little variety.\n\nOverall, this game is just absolutely great. I recommend playing it on the Hard difficulty, as it feels like the right way to play the Witcher. You have to make use of your alchemy to make bombs, potions and oils to turn the battlefield to your favor.\n\njk fuq dis game\nno seriously\nplay this game\nplease\nplz\n","October 31, 2013","true","53.3"," 375 of 418 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","375","418","0","2"

This review was wrtten just a couple of days before the release of The Witcher 3, and without having played The Witcher 2 yet. This way I hope to be able to look at the original game in the series with fresh eyes, not with the hindsight of the other games somewhere in the back of my head. It's also important to notice that this review addresses the final release of the game, from september 2008, i.e. The "Enhanced Edition: The Director's Cut". This version represents the developers' final thoughts and ideas on the game, and it differs considerably from any other version.\n\nIn this game, the player takes the role of Geralt of Rivia, a witcher or a professional monster-slayer. There is no character-build menu, no fancy options about hair-colour or the width of your eyebrows. You are Geralt of Rivia, you are a Witcher. And to put it simple: the game is so utterly brilliant since it manages to let you believe that, almost from the start. Seldom have I felt so deeply connected to the character I was playing: after a couple of in-game hours, I started to think as Geralt, react to my surroundings as Geralt, even feel like Geralt: I was completely involved, the game got deep under my skin, I was bewitched. It's not that I played the game for hours and hours on end, or that I played through the night, no: it's more like I felt Geralt had become part of my life, not only while in-game, but also while not playing. I started to look for articles and websites to read about The Witcher and its world, and I even dreamt a couple of times about the game and its characters...\n\nThe game's greatest strengths: the world, the story, the choices\nAs is commonly known by now, the Polish developer CD Project Red started working on The Witcher – actually their first game – out of love for the books, novels and stories by the Polish writer Andrzej Sapkowski. Sapkowksi is the author of The Witcher-universe: a collection of books and stories about a fictional, fantasy-world with a profound background and a history all of its own. Sapkowski has often been called "The Polish Tolkien", and while that might be too big a compliment, I often felt like I was part of a world that could hold its own against Tolkiens incredible rich universe. And I suppose that explains why I felt so connected to the game and so deeply involved: the world of The Witcher did already exist before the game, and is completely coherent and believable by itself.\n\nIt is one thing to have an interesting world to build a game in, it's another to write and develop a story within this world that works well for a role-playing game. The story of The Witcher however succeeds brilliantly in keeping the player's interest. It is ambitious, full of twists and unexpected turns, but it stays believable right up to the end. The different characters, both Geralt and his main protagonists, are complex and multi-layered: hardly anyone in this world is just "good" or "evil": most of the time, its a mix of both, often with one or several other characteristics  added. The game does a fantastic job in introducing the player (Geralt) to this world, using an old trick: after having lost his memory, Geralt has to rediscover not only the places, the stories and the people, but he has to rediscover himself: he has to give himself a place in the dark, conflict-ridden world he lives in.\n\nThe main way to do this, is by making choices: the game's strongest point by far is the feeling you get that the decisions you make actually matter, and do influence the flow and even the outcome of the story. This is especially impressive since almost every choice, from minor to very important, is difficult and hardly clear-cut. The games offers tons of dialogues, more than 5000 lines of text to be read and/or said, but very seldom did I feel like doing the "good thing". In most cases, the situation was so dire or the possible answers so gruff, that I had a hard job to make decisions that felt "right" at all. It was more like "trying to do my best, and hoping for the best", since often decisions or roads taken early in the game, proved to have unexpected consequences (much) later on. The way in which this game manages to make me think about good and evil, about morality and consequences, is utterly and completely brilliant.\n\nThe game's problem: it tries too hard to be the best rpg in the world\nFrom whatever angle you look at it, it is obvious that The Witcher is a very, very ambitious game. The developers made no secret of it that, even back in 2007 when they were almost unknown, they wanted to make "the best rpg ever". Ambition definitely is a good thing for any developer, it can also be a trap. While CD Project Red succeeded brilliantly with everything story- and character-related, they paid dearly in some other departments. The actual gameplay, the movement and combat, form the game's biggest downfalls. As a matter of fact, lots of people have tried the game, only to leave it after running into frustration with the combat system. Combat is an exercise in rythmical feeling: by clicking at the right moment, Geralt can chain attacks together so that they become much stronger. Fast clicking is of no use whatsoever, as is blocking or parrying since the game takes care of that.\n\nMoreover, Geralt has two different swords (steel for humans and animals, silver for monsters) and three differend combat styles (strong, fast and group style) at his disposal, so choosing the right weapon and the right sword for any fight is an important issue. Combat is much more tactical than in most rpg's, and since dozens of alchemical potions, lots of special coatings for either of your swords, six magical signs and even some bombs are thrown into the equation as well, it is very easy to get overwhelmed by this avalanche of ideas. Still, when one is prepared to play the game slow, with lots of attention to the myriad of entries in the journal (on quests, people, monsters, alchemical ingredients, recipes or locations), the sense of fulfillment can be enormous. This is most of all true of the alchemy, which is a very important part of the game. It takes a time to get the hang of it, when once mastered, it proves very rewarding.\n\nFinal thoughts\nPlaying and mastering The Witcher felt like climbing a mountain: it takes time, patience and commitment, even preparation, but once everything gets going, the long way to the summit becomes a joy by itself. In the case of the first game in the series, the mountain definitely is not Mount Everest nor even Mont Blanc, and the path is littered with dangerous spots and possible downfalls, but the scenery is gorgeous nonetheless, and the journey towards the summit proved one I won't ever forget.\n\nGameplay: 25/30 (provided one takes the time to master the combat system)\nGraphics: 16/20 (the game looks brilliant for its age)\nSound: 8/10 (the music is fantastic, the voice-acting is not)\nTechnical stability: 9/10 (I got no crashes whatsoever with this final edition)\nSteam integration: 7/10 (like any older game, it comes without cards or achievements)\nGame for the money: 9/10 (it's a very long game, but it's not an open-world sandbox)\nPersonal appreciation: 10/10\n\nOverall Score: 84/100","May 15, 2015","true","80.2"," 238 of 253 people (94%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","94","238","253","10","18"

Mature and dark, with controversial topics handled mostly with care, the tale will grip you from a few hours in and not let go until the end.\n\nB) Combat that starts off horrendously, but much like with the story, gets much better after a few hours. It's still a bit janky, but it rewards patience and preparation more than twitch skill.\n\nC) A beautiful, well-realized world, with plenty of lore and stories to find if you look hard enough. Dozens of optional quests, handfuls of interesting NPCs, and items to obtain.\n\nThe Witcher seems like a much older game than it is, because it's a bit janky and feels dated, but if you can stomach the very slow first few hours, you'll open up an exciting ride through a well-realized and fantastic world.\n\nRecommended, but be warned: it is a very long game, especially if you end up doing sidequests or exploring.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrluchador/recommended/20900/","mrluchador","Chris","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrluchador/","1587 products in account","The Witcher is an RPG where you play as Geralt - an Alcoholic Sex Addict who solves crimes, mysteries and paranormal events. You're a stoic guy, who doesn't really know or speak much of their past and seems to have an supply of redhaired sidekicks to help you ou. Basically, you're a white haired David Duchovny.\n\nThere is a lot I liked about The Witcher; such as the narative and compact storyline that can branch in several different ways. The Alchemy system to craft potions and oils, which become almost essential as the game progresses. Books & Scroll which progress the lore beyond that of NPC interactions, and in some instances help you gain extra loot and information about monsters.\n\nYet, there is one aspect I just wasn't keen on at all and that (switches to silver sword strong style to fight the Trolls) was the combat system. It's an interesting idea and concept, but I just didn't get into it. There are six different fighting styles - Silver Sword and Steel Sword. Each sword has 3 different attack options - Strong, Quick & Group. You need to select the correct sword adn the correct attack option to do the optimal damage to the enemy. Silver Swords are perfect for Non-Human creatures, and Steel Sword is perfect for Human creatures. Strong style is best for large, heavy hitting enemies, while quick is best for more agile, quicker enemies. Group, naturally, is best against a large group of enemies.\nOn paper it sounds pretty intelligent, but in reality it was somewhat frustrating and uninspiring. At one point the battles were simply referred to 'Benny Hills', due to the hit and run nature of the fights.\n\nhttp://www.twitch.tv/mrluchador/c/3845320\n\nSo it's for that reason I would suggest if you were going to play through the game to put it on the easiest settings. Hopefully then you won't be too distracted by the fights within the game and can gain an understanding of the gameworld before you jump into The Witcher 2 & 3. Sadly, just I was starting to become bored of the combat, the game felt the urge to suddenly throw in Mob Waves and Gauntlet battles (something it had not done up to this point). By the time you reach the Final Chapter, you're suddenly fight more enemies than you've ever had to fight throughout the game that had came before hand.\n\nIt's the kind of game I wish I had played on release several years ago, or in retrospect loaded up with mods before I attempted to play it several years after release to fix the issues that others seemed to share.\nOverall I'm pleased I played The Witcher, as I know feel like I'll understand The Witcher 3 somewhat better (there are tiny small droplets of references to 'The Wild Hunt' lore within The Witcher), and there are some honestly good moments within the game that need to be seen first hand. It's just a shame that the combat system gets in the way.\n\nSo if you're someone who wants to get into The Witcher for Witcher 3 then this game might be for you if you slap it on easy and soak in the Game World and Lore. If you're a fan of RPGs I'm not entirely sure where I'd go with my recommendation. I guess, in the end, it's only fitting (yet sadly unable in Steam Reviews) to sit on the fence and air my neutrality on this.","March 9, 2014","true","38.8"," 134 of 150 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","134","150","0","0"

It was a great to not just play a game, but also be part of that game as well.\n\nI picked up both Witcher 1 & 2, where -some- decisions you made in the first game can transfer over ( as well as minor gear change ) ; I recommend to get a copy of both!\n\nDon't let all the features in the game "scare" you away. As to maximize the game, you use all talents/features ( Alchemy, Signs and Weapons ). During the slow impact of the first Chapter, you get a chance to work on all your options. Honestly speaking, I only used 2 weapons ( monster/human ) 2 signs ( Fire/Push ) and a handful of potions.\n\nThere are some glitches (mostly) during combat, but not game challenging. ( ex. Boxing or attacking mulitple adds with single attacks )\nThe major complaint I received about this game was people felt overwhelmed with the decision making mixed with talents. Don't let them is all I can recommend. Enjoy the overall gameplay. You don't need to worry about using everything at once and like mentioned above, the first chapter is a great tool to learn it all from.\n\nWhen you start playing this game until when you stop, you feel as if you're part of the game itself. The Witcher does have replay value so you may learn each outcome of game impacting decisions.\n\nPros :\n- Good graphics\n- Controls are easy to get a handle of\n- Amazing Storyline\n- Decision making with impacts\n\nCons :\n- Minor Glitches with combat system\n- Repetitive combats\n\nRating : 8.5/10","February 2, 2014","true","65.2"," 86 of 91 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","86","91","0","0"

The Witcher doesn't want to be easy. Played on the hardest settings, it requires you to watch for "tells" in combat to be effective. You must brew and use potions, and be properly equipped for any and all fights.\n\nIt then makes you decide how you want to shape your world. Are you going to side with the one group over the other?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/freshVeggie/recommended/20900/","freshVeggie","freshVeggie","http://steamcommunity.com/id/freshVeggie/","705 products in account","It is a very solid RPG with an extraordinary good world filled with great, unique characters who actually feel real. It is definitely the driving force for me. Loved the mature themes, struggles and politics. It's a very interesting world which I absolutely want to learn and change further. Thankfully the next two games are already waiting for me :)\n\nWhile The Witcher offers some very highs in certain parts, it sadly also has some mediocre parts which only feel that lesser compared to the great things. Combat, especially swordplay feels too passive. Thankfully the signs (magic spells) feel more direct and upon some leveling up therein are very good methods of spicing combat up. Personally ended up using only two signs, Ard and Igni, so I would have appreciated some more diversity in offensive spells but I just settled with what was offered and it still was plenty enjoyable.\n\nAnother very important aspect is alchemy. Despite what the game might tell you at the start considering it being not needed at easy difficulty, it absolutely is. Collecting herbs and other substances from carcasses was not too tedious. I still wished there was an option to map a hotkey to quick-loot.\nThe actual alchemic mixture of potions is a bit to convoluted and not very well displayed. Having the ability to disassemble herbs etc. into base alchemic ingredients would have been much better at helping better grasp potion mixing. There are only a handful of base ingredients but a lot more herbs etc.\n\nThe character leveling system is nicely split into four character stats, spells and swords. As much as I like having reign over detailed upgrade paths, I still believe splitting sword upgrades into six (!) separate groups was a bad decision. Having only two, Steel & Silver would have been better as it makes little sense having three paths for each stance (strong, fast, group) to divert scarce upgrade points into. In combat you mostly have to use each stance at various points of battle. Very often does combat start with a small group consisting of enemy types. Thus using group stance helps clear multiple enemies quickly leaving 1-2. And for those you select the appropriate other stance.\n\nIt is very clear that there are some very talented devs at CDPR which can absolutely create great RPG worlds where you quickly get invested in. Being their first game and taking the scope and various at times intricate mechanics into consideration, I can overlook reoccurring buildings, assets, dull animations and transitions. It sure would be appreciated elevating these issues in sequels though.\n\nAll in all I am glad that I listened to a friends advice and gave this fairly dated game a try. I am very positive that I wouldn't have enjoyed it as much (and forgiven its faults) after playing the much more popular sequels first.\nI can't say that it is a game for everyone and also not that it might be worth the many hours it needs to get going. Getting accustomed to its flow and mechanics takes several hours. It doesn't help that the first levels aren't really that interesting and for me at least the middle became a pain courtesy of ever repeating locations (damn you Vizima!). But for those powering through, a very, oh so very great end third is waiting. Totally made stale sections worth powering through.","June 4, 2015","true","45.9"," 59 of 62 people (95%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","95","59","62","5","1"

Graphically the game is dated, but for those that don't concern with that, the graphics is quietly acceptable. As for sound quality, the effects follow the other technical aspects and has its flaws, however I have to say that the soundtrack is great!\n\nAs for the plot, needs no comments, is by far the strongest point of the game. The way the story evolves and the aspects that compose it, beyond common cliches we see in roleplaying games, is something unique. During the storyline there are several choices to make, choices that go beyond good or bad, right or wrong, that make you think and reflect on your decisions and that impact directly in the plot, however small and insignificant they may seem. The lore is also impressive, as is the variety of well constructed characters, and the ending is surprising.\n\nGotta be honest, the game has its flaws, is notable that at the time the game was made, CD PROJEKT RED lacked the necessary resources, they weren't suitable with their aspirations. The animations aren't the best as well as the gameplay, excessive comes and goes in some scenarios and the lack of a functional inventory are unsatisfying. It's still a perfectly playable game and a unique title for those who like RPG.

First I want to mention that I beat the game in exactly 39 hours (107 days total), I did all the main story quests + many side quests I would say that I have probably done 65-70% of all the side quests.\n=======================\nStory: One of the most immersive storylines I have ever played. I usually have trouble following long storylines because english is not my native language, but I had absolutely no trouble following this one and understanding everything that the game wants me to do. This is the best part of the game, 10/10\nFreedom of choice: The game will often ask you how you want to go about doing centain things, like picking a side for example. Infact you have to make so many choices that the game would completely change if you play it a second time. The choices play a big part on the story and I will definitely do a second playthrough in the future just to see how different the game will be, 9/10\nFree roam: This is a very big downside in my opinion. Every chapter has it's own "place of operations", you are confined to only one place where you have to do your quests in order to advance to other sections. The places are big, but get boring after you walk around the same street a 70th time, 6/10\nGameplay: The fighting mechanics at the start were incredibly annoying. They were so annoying infact that I ragequit a couple times because I didn't understand the proper way of using them. Way into the game though I really saw the appeal of them. Having 10+ enemies coming after you means that you have to do a lot of fast thinking, changing combat styles and using different potions. So the fighting at first seems primitive and annoying until you get used to it, then it becomes amazing, 8/10\nGraphics: Amazing graphics for a 2007 game. The greenery especially is beautiful, 8/10\nMisc: Not being able to jump and walking off half a meter ledges is very frustrating. The game is full of invisible walls and really slows down your movement. You have to often guess where you can walk. These limitations are the worst thing about the game and the reason why it is not my GOTY of 2007, instead it will take the 2nd place in my list, 1/10\n==============================\nThat's it for the review, I recommend the game, I payed 2 euro for it on the summer sale, but would have gladly payed 10 euro if I knew how amazing it was.

If you've played the later games then watch out, the UI is completely different and the whole gameplay feels alien, but this game still has so much to recommend it. What I really love is that decisions you make in this game can ripple through all three games. Yep, Who you support in this game will change who likes you in the third game, now that's an immersive storyline! You end up playing this game for the story, which is excellent and fluid. There is no "bad" ending (or "good" ending), just the ending you chose through the story with the loss of friends and deaths that this incurs. And all this occers in such a believable world that It's no wonder the creater of the witcher books is called "the polish tolkien".\n\nSo, want a dark RPG in a deep and incredibly detailed world? Come right in! Just try not to destroy your mouse/keyboard/screen when you encounter the Kikimore queen, honestly, the only reason that encounter didn't lead me to uninstalling the game and never looking at the series again is that I wanted to know what happened next.\n\nWhen a game can do that, it's worth every cent.\n\nOh I forgot to mention  the "romance cards". Though basically softcore porn (in the enchanced edition/directors cut anyway) they are very well done and made me stop playing until I stopped laughing the first time. Basically, someone at CD Project has obviously played some Hentai games and decided that the 'list your conquests' idea fits this game universe (spoiler: read the books, it does :-) ) so you get renaissance style painings of hentai conquest cards. The developers of this series rock, and it shows in their games. Dark and gritty, wacky humour and anime references?

Bonus stuff added at the end.It's amazing for an 2007 RPG game. 8/10Baked with care in CD Projekt RED's oven for years, and still considered good to this day.\nLiterally, one of the few good RPG's that involve isometric view and click-to-kill mechanics that i enjoyed.\n(I used OTS view, though.)\n\nPROS:The best thing about the game is that the combat system is not like;\n-*click on enemy*\n-*wait for an hour for him to die*\n-*get 1shotted because you don't have enough defense skill*\n\n*Very content heavy, will provide you hours of gameplay.\n\n*The world around you is not just plastic, but it feels real, with many places to visit.\n\n*Thanks to the dynamic combat system, you really have a blast while confronting many enemies.\n\nCONS:\n*Cutscenes (NOT CINEMATICS!) are pretty buggy, and the lipsync is not on point everytime.\n\n*The optimization is not THAT good, but it's adequate. Hitman Absolution on High/Ultra settings\nruns faster than this game with Medium/High settings.

This is very good, adds a lot of tension to the decision making part.\n\n+ Game cuts off resources to make potions at the most unpredictable and the most stressful fights and believe me, this hits like a train.\n\n+ I found the fact above very satisfying, because the overall slow pace in the dialogue story progressions that are supposed to give you a "oh wow im safe now" vibe and then the game shoves in a bunch of elite enemies... I liked the challenge. This way, fights are very fast and quick decisions have to be made, like strafing and dodging, but you can be a baby and eliminate this with active pause which i haven't used.\n\n+ There is usually no handholding except of objective notifications which are vital.\n\n+ If you know the right time to use a potion, you don't finish the game with 600 of them because you actually need them to progress sometimes.\n\n+ The fluidness of game makes you appreciate most basic of resources. The feeling when finding a high quality potion base in a dead enemy, while you are stuck inbetween 2 rooms filled with elite enemies... Even though it's not real at all, the satisfaction, very real.\n\n+ You can't feel the time pass as the game draws you in. You can feel that you are actually progressing after finishing a mission, and that just sucks you in.\n\n+ Fighting multiple fast enemies that dodge and have the ability to stun/pain (wraths for example), is an absolutely edge of seat experience. Even though you are not in an arena and everyone is chanting "Kill them all!", you will eventually find yourself in life/death situations where you have to act very quickly only to survive. You must dodge and attack your way through the enemies without wasting time on potions, because if you usually get bamboozled by a large (10-20) group of enemies consider yourself 6 feet underground.\nor just master igni sign and f*ck them all up\n\n+ Speaking of f*cking, you will get a lot if you have some speech up your sleeve.\n\nHowever, there were one or two cons that dissapointed me.\n\n- Sometimes progression can get slow since game lacks a fast travel.\n\n- There is a quest bug in first quest of Chapter V. Remember to keep a save, if you start it again you may proceed. Not knowing this took my one hour.\n\n- Some other minor things that i can't bother to write.","May 3","true","46.4"," 62 of 71 people (87%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","87","62","71","12","1"

If you haven't played any of the witcher games before I seriously recommend you play this first, so you don't get thrown off by the combat system. The combat in this game is a combination of left-click qtes and right-click spells. When you attack in this game, you click once, wait for the attack animation to near completion, and then click again when prompted to keep fighting. If you click too fast, you screw up the attack and need to start over. If you do it too slow, you have to do the first attack set again dealing less damage, and possibly getting you killed.\n\nThe graphics are from 2008, and it shows. The graphics are 8 years old, so don't expect much. I recommend the rise of the white wolf mod to update some of the character models, and if you so choose, the UI.\n\nNow for the good stuff. The Witcher games are based on a series of books by Polish author Andrzej Sapkowski, so naturally the story is packed full of lore to discover. The story is pretty awesome, and end game events serve as a direct lead in to the next game. There's a main story focused on justice/revenge, and a secondary civil war-esq plot between the humans and non-humans in the kingdom.\n\nWhen you get down to it, there really isn't a game like this, and despite it's initial akwardness and age, it is a fun game overall with lots of side missions that have an effect on the next game should you import your save.","May 10","true","175.2"," 45 of 49 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","45","49","0","3"

Your monster hunter Geralt of Rivia an outcast, hero, and necessary evil in a world filled with dreaded monsters that need to be killed.  Geralt is thrust into a conflict he doesn't belong in with intrigue, backstabbing, and concealed agendas.  The game itself is just a plus to the fantastic storytelling.  One game where your choices really do have consequences so many choices on the story on how you can align with or stay autonomous like the witchers of past.  This is a mature story not meant for the young because there is nudity but in all honesty who doesn't like a little digital nudity from time to time, especially when its just makes and breaks the storytelling involved.  Now the combat system has little learning curve where you can't get it just right till you invest a little time the game. The save files on average are around 30mb so be prepared to have small quantity of your hard drive taken over by the save folder but its worth every penny if your like me and save often.  So you can go back and replay it different right away if you didn't like how it turned it.  This is a phenomenal game that has a strong following for exactly that reason.

I realize I'm late to the party, as the original Witcher came out in 2007, almost 8 years before writing this review. With that said, The Witcher doesn't feel like an out-of-date game. The graphics are still quite beautiful. What I can tell from completing The Witcher is that it had some direct effect on more modern RPGs.\n\nWitcher brings an adult-theme to gaming. Here you make your choices and face the consequences of those choices. There is no scale of right or wrong. You are the scale of right or wrong. Your past decisions and the occasional sprinkling of regret are what shape your future actions throughout the story.\n\nThe Witcher has very little hand holding for quests and objectives. It's actually required that you pay attention, follow the dialogue, and consider priorities. The story is driven by interaction, not cutscenes. It truly is a breath of fresh air for someone who wants to be immersed in another world. This requires the player to have that interest: you can't mindlessly  blunder your way to the ending.\n\nAs for the gameplay... If there is anything that should be overstated, it's that you should take your time. I spent 30+ hours in the Witcher, on the hardest difficulty, and I still feel like I don't understand many of the concepts. There are a multitude of customization options to alter your experience. This partially causes some awkwardness with the combat system, particularly with combat controls. I personally played Over-The-Shoulder(OTS) because I felt much more directly involved with the world than either isometric camera.\n\nThe hardest difficulty makes preparation necessary, which definitely adds a dimension to the combat. Knowing how to approach your enemies, researching your foe, utilizing your potions and the proper technique is half the battle. If you've developed your signs or bombs, this adds another dimension. Without that extra difficulty the combat is pretty simplistic, revolving primarily around appropriate clicking for attack combos. There is awkwardness from the controls; even during the epilogue I found myself swapping weapons or signs improperly. It caused some rather obnoxious deaths.\n\nThe inventory management is spectacular, simple, effective, easily one of the best I've had the pleasure of using. The same can be said for the crafting/alchemy panels. The journal and glossary are perfectly organized and easily accessible. They provide useful information including direction, extra lore, character knowledge, pictures, and even combat tactics. Character development (leveling up) has a plethora of options which allow for customization based on playstyle. I personally disliked that I couldn't keep Geralt well-rounded, but I can see how this adds replay value.\n\nThe plot is hunt down the bad guy and do some Witcher work on the side. Despite my intention to remain neutral in the ever growing conflict, I eventually chose a side. The side quests were my favorite aspect and where I spent the majority of my time. I had two obvious options for pursuing romances, but neither appealed to me. I must have slept with 30+ different people, which is practically its own mini-game. Speaking of mini-games, the extra hunt targets, fistfights and dice poker were entertaining.\n\nThe Witcher's world is still fresh and beautiful. The day/night cycle, weather effects, and other environment aspects are done masterfully. These effects directly change the world, for example: NPCs will remain indoors during the evenings or heavy rainstorms. I'm looking forward to the next in the series.\n\nTL;DR - I highly recommend this game, even in 2015.","May 17, 2015","true","35.5"," 35 of 38 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","35","38","2","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zephyrkain/recommended/20900/","zephyrkain","Zephyr","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zephyrkain/","30 products in account","I just got around to finally playing the first Witcher game. If you enjoy story-driven games, where you have non-generic choices and they actually have a meaningful impact on the story, this game is for you.\n\nThe Witcher offers a very morally grey world for you to explore that is rich with deep story elements. I was so impressed by the story and characters in this game, that I was even compelled to start reading the books, from which the game is derived, so that I could learn more about the lore and personalities that make up the game.\n\nWhile I do highly recommend this game, I will disclose that it does have it's share of flaws. The graphics are rather outdated, as it is an older game and, while it does have come with a rather unique and interesting character development system, the actual combat is pretty repetative and uninteresting, especially later in the game, which I have a lot respect for.\n\nIn addition to these more upfront issues, the layout of the game can also be listed as a minor issue. There are several quests that will have you running all the way to the other side of the map, just to pick up an item from an NPC, before running all the way back to the other side to drop it off...and then back to the original giver to collect your reward. In short: There is a lot of mindless running.\n\nEvery new area also comes with a number of grind quests, where you will need to kill a number of monsters and collect various parts to turn in for your reward. These quests offer nothing to the story and the rewards are usually just some extra EXP and money (which you get an abundance of through the story quests).\n\nAll-in-all, the game's main selling point is the incredible story that it tells and the multitude of ways that you can change and influence that story. I would definately recommend this game for at least one play through, if you can get past the repetative combat and long stretches of running. I would suggest, if you are playing just to experience the story, that you skip over all of the monster slayer quests, as the reward is not worth the initial investment. Another perk of playing this game, is that many of you can import your saved file into The Witcher 2 and many of your choices carry over (for example: certain groups in The Witcher 2 will be friendly or hostile to you, based on your choices in the first game...or you might have a character give you a special gift, for helping them with a problem in the first game).\n\nAs an added bonus, the developers were also very true-to-form with the books. The opening cinematic is almost a visual play-by-play of the first short-story with very little creative liberties taken for the sake of marketing or some other business model scheme.\n\n\nPros\n\nIncredible story and lore\nMorally grey choices that strike out from the generic "good vs. evil" route\nUnique character development system\nMany cross-over elements that carry into the second game\n\nCons\n\nDated graphics\nRepetative Combat\nVery spread out quest objectives, resulting in lots of running\nUnnecessary grind quests","September 7, 2015","true","54.2"," 27 of 27 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","27","27","0","0"

It's infuriating to read that people who loved the series often patronise those who did not, claiming they don't enjoy 'true' RPG's or that they don't 'understand' the grand concept of the game. Likewise, it's equally as infuriating to reader hater troll's post things such as 'this game sucks coz the combat is lame', because that simply justifies the formers comments. So, as to not dilute the worth of this review, I:\n\ndo really enjoy RPG's.\ndo really understand the difference between an RPG and a game with RPG aspects, such as the ME series.\ndo enjoy the ME series, but wish it wasn't so black and white it it's good and evil approach.\ndid give the game a full chance, as I completed the game and played it for over 50 hours.\ndo prefer substance over style.\ndo not prefer COD or games that are about quick reflexes, in other words, games that are FPS's.\ndo understand the actual story.\nalso am not a child, so wasn't overawed or possibly manipulated by the 'adult' content.\ndid not play the game in spits and bursts/suffer from a short attention span, some of my favourite games/films are steadily paced and longer in length, encouraging a narrative over action.\n\nOkay, so now those predispositions are established, my thoughts on the game are that its backdrop is intriguing, with racial, sexual and political undercurrents driving the world of Geralt. The story is interesting and the option to shape in-game decisions in a shades-of-grey approach is refreshing. Although good/bad choices work in games like KOTOR as it is ingrained the world of Star Wars, other games have adopted this approach as a lazy 'lets give off the illusion that we have a lot of choice, yet in reality we have 2' option.\n\nHowever, we must remember that this is a game, an interactive medium wherein part of our enjoyment comes from our ability to play through the protagonist's development and narrative. The gaming content of The Witcher is totally dull. The quests, much like they are in the sequal, involve killing X amount of enemies to collect Y amount of pelts, in order to recieve money. These side quests are the oldest and most tiresome in the industry and the game in inundated with them.\n\nMany of the other sidequests and indeed the main quests, are mainly aiming for you to run to one location, drop something off or deliver a message, then run back, and repeat and repeat. The constant loading times are an issue but they can be overlooked, yet  they do obviously hinder the experience if the quests mainly involve running from A to B.\n\nTalking to NPC's etc etc and ascertaining information, then getting information elsewhere is even acceptable, if the combat system was involving enough to keep the experience fresh. Now the combat system of a game is often a stick to beat you with by massive fans of RPG's or fans of The Witcher in general. If you claim 'the combat is dull', the accusation can be levelled 'oh if you want to have good combat then play an FPS you clearly don't understand RPG's' etc etc etc. Now this argument is total nonsense, of course, because your character Geralt is by default a character that uses combat. He is by title, a 'monster-slayer', and an enhanced one at that. Yet clicking your mouse over and over again is hardly a befitting reflexion of a monster-slayer and does little to portray his power to the player. Carefully timed 'clicks', yet through a real-time combat experience and not through a turn based one, gets tiresome rapidly.\n\nRecently I read a comment that noted, 'oh I don't play COD and moan that it lacks RPG elements, so don't play The Witcher and moan that is has bad combat and isn't as action packed as an FPS'. I understand this point, yet there is a total difference. COD would not throw an RPG element down your throat. It doesn't force you to use RPG elements at every turn. The Witcher does force you to use the combat system at every turn. Much of your time is spent fighting, using the combat system. Therefore the combat is a massive factor in why the game is tedious (anyone playing through the swamp in Act II can testify to how repetitive and tiring killing reappearing 'downers' is).\n\nThe 'mature' content of the game would be welcomed if it was subtle enough to be effective. Games really should target a mature player, using sophisticated and unilluted stories in order to not pander to the lowest common denominator. Yet the blasé approach in The Witcher is unconvincing and often awkward. NPC's saying '♥♥♥♥' or '♥♥♥♥' or '♥♥♥♥' does not make the game more for adults, neither do the appearance of 'sex cards' where Geralt has the option to shag a hooker in order to look at a half naked lady for 3 seconds. Yes it may be 'mature content', but that doesn't make it mature. It's juvenile frequent appearance in the game is seemingly there for shock factor as opposed to adding to the experience of the game. The developers could have demonstrated the bleakness of the world through subtler ways, which wouldn't have giving the impression that they were just trying to impress kids through swearing and sex.\n\nIn essence the game is totally dull. The story and world can be engaging, but it's hard to care after clicking over and over for 2 hours whilst running from A to B.\n\nI think the developers should be commended for creating a world that echoes the harsh realities of life, but they should reassess the gaming content. The bottom line is that the quests need to be more fun, the combat needs to be more engaging. Why create a world so sophisticated with an intriguing story yet dilute the experience through vanilla gameplay?\n\nIn conclusion, the game was not terrible, it just wasn't that fun. I find it difficult to see that anyone collecting 5 'downer' brains etc actually finds the task fun. Anyway, I hope you enjoyed this reviews, comments are very welcomed.","December 9, 2013","false","12.5"," 473 of 766 people (62%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","62","473","766","10","53"

That being said, I've never heard of the novels nor the game before I bought it. I got it at a 90% discount. I was watching the images and reviews for some time and I saw that a friend of mine had the game. After asking him if the game was worth it, I bought the game. He only said that it was very good. Nothing more. So I wasn't expecting anything extraordinary. Damn, if only I knew. Seriously, this game (and it's sequel) are the only games in the world I regret buying at a discounted price. I would have GLADLY bought them at full price (and seriously, only 10$ for this masterpiece? Finally a very good game at low price!!)\n\nGOOD\n- The storyline : Not only is it great, it's also very huge. The developpers really didn't just made a game as quickly as they could. The story is there, and you always want to know more.\n- You don't need to read the books before playing : Because yes, this game is a sequel to a novel series. You won't spoil yourself so much of the story (except the final, but there's going to be so many more questions when you'll learn what happened)\n- The bestiary : The creatures that lurks at night -- or not -- are very diversified. There's so much information you can get about them. If you stick to the story, maybe you'll encounter only half of them. And there's not only a lot of monsters, there's also a lot of fantasy humanoid creatures likes vampires, werewolves, elves, dwarves, etc.\n- Over 30 hours of gameplay : If you stick only to the story, you'll get around 35 hours of gameplay. But if you try to get everything, you have for more than 80 hours.\n- The gameplay itself : There's two gameplay mode : mouse and keyboard, and mouse. Even tho you'll probably prefer the first choice, the second one is also very good\n- The soundtrack : After playing this game, all of those beautiful music will stick in your head. Every music fits very well with the action. They are very enchanting and immersive. Plus you have all the soundtrack when you buy the game! Yay, wonderful music when I'm not playing this game!\n- You can collect sex cards : Yes, you can have sex with almost every girls in this game (including a princess... and a very sexy gingerhead witch <3)\n- The realism : Even if it's a fantasy game, there's a great realism as for the way people sees you. It reflect a lot our world by differents aspects, like racism, fear of the unknown, genocides, what's good and what's evil. There's a lot of choices to make that will make you wonder what you'll do if it was real.\n- The choices you make impact on the story : Every choices you make will have its consequences. There's always a way to rediscover the story by making differents choices from a game to another.\n- Graphics for 2007/2008 are trully amazing\n\nBAD\n- You don't really get new armors and weapons until late in the game. Dependly on the difficulty level, you don't really need a new one anyway.\n- It'll take some time to adapt to the sword-fighting gameplay\n- Some ingredients for the alchemy are very difficult to find\n\nLittle tip : Try to get Raven's armor at the last chapter. Not only is it useful, but you'll be able to load your saved file when you'll start The Witcher 2, so the choices you'ld have made will have effects on this new game too, AND you'll start with a very good armor from the start!\n\nI STRONGLY recommand this game to anyone who likes fantasy and/or RPGs. The characters are rich, lovable, the plot twists are seriously intense and sometimes, you won't even have a clue about a major spoil. Also, the difficulty levels trully makes a difference. I'm not the best gamer in the world, I usually can't finish my games because sometimes the ennemies become way too powerful/godlike, but I made it through this game in about 50 hours (trying to complete some quests on the side sometimes) and actually enjoy the game without raging against the monsters/ennemies all the time. Once you get how to beat them, you can make it.","June 5, 2014","true","55.3"," 35 of 42 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","35","42","0","0"

I'm fairly sure that despite being conditioned under vigorous training to remain as an efficiently impassive monster-slayer, no one mentioned being assaulted by 6ft of chin hair.\n\nThis has to do weird things to a person.\n\n\n\nEarly Review: This is the first game in the Witcher Series. I would recommend going for this Enhanced edition if possible and playing the games in their respective release order.\n\n- Firstly, you should expect a great opening video. Very few have made it to my list of scenes that I can not bring myself to skip, each time I start up the game.\n\n\n- The protagonist, Geralt, an emotionally-estranged Witcher, also known as the White Wolf (*shivers*...one of my favourite characters of ALL time) combines a fierce combination of strength and brutality in a character, to a promiscuous, yet apathetic personality - strangely alluring, leaving an unusual twist to the standard freedom-fighter hero, present in many other games of this genre.\n\n\n- So far, The Witcher's plot is one of my all-time RPG favourites. I find the depth of story highly immersive, and believe many who play will come to care greatly for the characters. Rarely am I hooked from the get-go.\n\nYou should expect a heavily story-driven state of play, with linear methods of questing, and a nice amount of Lore is available in game.\n\nSectioned into chapters, the game allows you to progress through the main story at a pace that I would consider to be acceptable.\nMany quests available are of no importance to the main story, though provide another welcome layer of depth. As side-quests, they can be missed, but for purposes of enjoyment I would recommend completing everything.\n\n\n- Initially, the controls, primarily directed by your mouse, feel very clunky and the interface is slow and methodical - fairly awkward in short, but you will overcome this with ease after a few hours of play. As an Action RPG featuring a hack and slash combat style, I can imagine that this received quite a bit of negative criticism, though personally I find it rather refreshing from the standard 'mashing your mouse to death' style.\n\nCertain aspects of the game require a little bit of thought - forward planning - which proves the Active-Pause to be quite useful, especially during the rougher combat situations, if you choose to play Hard Mode.\nPlaying with the medium difficulty setting, I still found myself challenged to the point that I had to replay certain scenes due to a gory death.\n\nDecision making is also a prominent feature, allowing you to tailor the actions of your protagonist, and the outcomes of your quests.\n\n\n\n- Graphically the game is outdated, but still looks good within today's standards when used on highest settings.\n\n\nHighly recommended, a must play for all fans of the RPG genre. 10/10","December 28, 2015","true","115.4"," 27 of 30 people (90%) found this review helpful 26 people found this review funny","90","27","30","26","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Soupinator/recommended/20900/","Soupinator","Soüp®: Legendary Edition","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Soupinator/","1293 products in account","Though a few years old and definitely not the best looking game in the world, The Witcher brings the fantasy world of Andrzej Sapkowski's Witcher novels into the video game world and does it in style.  When I first played this game several years ago, I was very turned off by the combat system which uses timed clicks in order to perform increasingly powerful combo attacks against enemies.  It feels a lot like a rhythm game when you first start but feels much more natural as you play more.\n\nThe Witcher uses its own game systems and rules unlike any other RPG I have played and they not only work very well, but fit the game's lore perfectly.  I like that it isn't as complex as a lot of systems such as D&D but still has plenty of depth to work with.\n\nGameplay is fun with fast-paced combat and plenty of RPG storytelling.  The content is well-balanced and the harder sections will require some thought and tactics rather than just plowing right into the fight.  Unfortunately some sections of the game will have you running around a lot with little action which can become tedious and may turn some people off.  The writing is surprisingly good with many genuinely funny lines and some (unfortunately not all) good voice actors.  Characters are interesting and have their own unique personalities.\n\nThe game's maps are well designed and leave plenty of room for exploration and side quests while you progress through the story.  It doesn't really have any of what I would consider secrets, though you will be rewarded for exploration.  One additional feature that I quite like is that the game does not let you collect or utilize alchemy ingredients from plants and monsters unless you first obtain knowledge of them from books or conversations with NPCs.  Being as your character has lost all his memory prior to the start of the game, it's a nice touch of realism.\n\nMy main gripe about this game is the same as The Witcher 2: combat control responsiveness.  Fairly often in combat you will attempt to perform a combo and Geralt will just stand there.  You click again and it kills your combo because it worked the first time and it just delayed the attack for no apparent reason.  Sometimes you will have to click multiple times for commands to register or it will target a different enemy than the one you clicked on, making Geralt move to another position to attack.\n\nThe other main problem I found is the game engine itself, the Aurora Engine.  This is the engine that Bioware has used since Neverwinter Nights though they tend to rename it with each major update.  Having played most of the games produced on it, I have never been impressed with the performance of any of them and The Witcher isn't any different.  In addition, not being able to take advantage of multi-core processors it is heavily CPU-bound on modern gaming PCs and the game's framerate can regularly drop significantly despite its 2007-era graphics.  It does still remain playable though.\n\nThe Witcher is a very mature game with plenty of (though mostly optional) sexual content.  It has been regularly criticized for its callous treatment of sex (it even gives you collectible cards for all the women you sleep with) though I find it makes sense in the context of the lore.  It has superb writing, fun gameplay and for me, it beats Dragon Age by a mile in all aspects.  I highly recommend the series to any RPG fans.","December 27, 2014","true","47.5"," 29 of 34 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","29","34","0","0"

In this dark fantasy-medieval world, you live the tale of Geralt of Rivia, a professional monster slayer, a Witcher. Geralt and his fellow witchers and companions must deal with Salamandra, an organization that is causing chaos in the Kingdom of Temeria. But, in the middle of this quest, Geralt will find a lot of people, and must take a decisions that will change the future of the adventure. And there's a conflict between The Order of the Flaming Rose and the rebels nonhumans, the Scoia'tel. Prepare to embark in a world of chaos, monsters, and witchers.\nThe game is a RPG, so you will role play the life of Geralt. Divided in 5 chapters, a prologue and epilogue, each chapter will have new maps available, including swamps, outskirts of a great city and the quarters of the great city itself. It's region-open-world, medium-sized areas connected (some rather small bu there is dungeons and buildings that you can enter). There is passage of time and real time weather, so there's rain in the game (a lot). You can upgrade Geralt with skills and new gear (there is some new weapons and armor in the game, includind swords, silver swords, axes, daggers, etc). The game's graphic are just fine. They may be 2008 graphics, but running everything on Ultra, it continues to be beautiful today. The gameplay is maybe the only BAD regard about the game. Geralt can't run so fast, which is boring some times, as you must traverse various maps sometimes (no fast travel here, guys). The combat, ah, the combat. First thing when you get in the game, is to realize that the combat is a mess, complicated and ♥♥♥♥ed up thing. But don't give up. After 1-2 hours playing, you will get the way to play, and the combat will be like something you can take to finish your adventure. (and sometimes,as for me, i found it pretty funny). You can use alchemy to brew dozens of different potions, with dozens of different effects. There is a lot of characters, side quests, and things to resolve. And there is also romance, and the infamous "sex cards". Each woman Geraly have sex in the game, you win a card despising her naked in a sexy position. No problem for men here haha. The soundtrack, ah, the soundtrack. ONE OF THE BEST EVER i've ever heard. It's amazing, the feel, the thrill, the epicness. And it's not just the soundtrack itself. The sound effects are immersive, with kids, poeple talking, everything, and with the fact the NPCs are always doing something, is probably one if not the most immersive medieval world i've ever see. All the game, while i was playing, i enjoyed a lot all the immersion,the animals, the feel, the amazing scenarios! As you're a monster slayer, there is also a LARGE variety of them,all within an immense glossary, containing also information about everything, including alchemy materials you collect like herbs you can harvest.\nApart from all the quality of the game, it shines on its glorious storyline, characters, and development of them. The story it's amazing, with a rich universe. It's development is EPIC. Chapter II investigation, gosh, with plot twists all the time. EPIC, i repeat. And also, YOU build the story. The choices you made, and it's consequences, will affect the story and change it! You make your destiny. Also, about the characters, they're charismatic and you develop friendship with them, or even romance in some cases. YOU start to LIKE the characters, a feeling you don't get anymore on actual games.\nThere is also a high level of detail and roleplay.For everything you do, there is an animation, like eating food, powering up your sword and drinking potions. And also, there is a lot of food in the game, and for each type of food a different animation plays in. There is also a HUGE variety of beer. All types, and you can get drunk. When you are talking to someone or someone is talking to you, your head will be directed to the person you are talking to. There is also fisstech, a drug you can use, and become drugged. The game is quite interactive is you can see.\nThe game is quite big, i beat it in 43 hours making all quests i could, aside from notice board quests.If you are going for 100%, there is a good 60 hours to put in the game, and the high replayability. It's a good start in The Witcher series, and if you can survive the combat, you will find one of the greatest RPG ever made.\n\n\n+High Replayability\n+Choices and consequences\n+Intriguing and Epic story\n+Epic and amazing soundtrack and sound effects\n+Big Immersion\n+Customization, lots of weapons, armors and skills\n+Realtime weather and passage of time.\n+Charismatic characters\n+Fine graphics and scenarios\n+A lot of sidequests and talk\n+Cool scenarios\n+Variety of monsters.\n+Long campaign\n+Glossary\n+Romance cards\n+Epic CGI in the start and in the end of the game.\n+Geralt is a ♥♥♥♥ing badass!\n\n\n-Dull and complicated combat\n-Gameplay and some animations\n-Sometimes it may crash without reason.\n\n\nOne of the most immersive RPGs i've ever played.

The profound success of the game resulted in what will be at least a 3 game series.\n\nGameplay Description\nTake on the role of Geralt, a professional monster hunter and expert swordsman.  Use alchemy and spells to enhance your abilities.\n\nThe combat is pretty simple.  Select the correct sword (Steel for humans, silver for monsters).  Click to a rhythm and watch Geralt destroy everything in his path.  Drink potions or apply oils to your weapons where appropriate.\n\n\nBrief Backstory on The Witcher's Original Release and the Significance of the Enhanced Edition\nThe Witcher PC game released before it's appearance on Steam.  The original version was pretty rough around the edges, but the game was still a blast to play for the excellent dark story and atmosphere.\n\nPlayers had to be willing to play through slow loading times, bugs and crashes, a cluttered inventory and other small inconveniences.  Players who were patient with this though were rewarded with a pretty great story that pays homage to the Witcher novel series. (The game takes place immediately following the end of the novels apparently).\n\nAfter finishing the game, rather than moving on, CDProjekt Red spent roughly a year and change working on the game post-release.  Their work would include:\n\nFixing Bugs\nDrastically improving loading times\nImproving Character Models\nReworking voice acting for better dialogue\nImproving the inventory system to make it less cluttered and more organized\nCreating 2 brief DLC Campaigns: "The Lesser Evil" and "Side Effects". (Added for Free)\nFor computers with colored lights, the game will change the case colors based on what's happening in game.\nAll of these changes would be included in an update for the game that would be called The Witcher: Enhanced Edition Director's Cut.\n\nThis new improved version of the game was offered as a free upgrade for existing users.  In addition to this, when The Witcher: Enhanced Edition hit Steam, CDProjekt Red very quickly began offering it at the absurdly low price of $12.99.  Their business practices have been extremely pro-consumer and they've earned a lot of credibility in the game community as a result.  They have a great trackrecord so far.\n\nI'd say CDProjekt Red is probably one of the most trustworthy and respectable game developers out there in regards to being fair and non-exploitative of The Witcher's fanbase.\n\nKeep an eye on anything they're involved with, it's bound to be quality\n\nBack to the game.\n\nPros Illustrates the novel series brilliantly.  Lots of attention to detail for the story and lore.\nFantastic atmosphere and Dark setting.\nThis game embraces the "choices matter" concept.  There's a fair amount of causality in the game.\nSimple to play.  This game is primarily driven by the story.\nAfter release of the original, the Enhanced Edition is the result of major polishing efforts by CDProjekt Red to fix bugs, improve dialogue, minigames, loading times and all aspects of the game.  Upgrades to this version were offered for free for existing users.  Big props to CDProjekt Red for this.\nCons This is the first game in the series and is pretty rough around the edges in some places.\nSometimes the occasional crash still occurs. Save frequently.\nCombat is pretty rigid considering Geralt is supposed to be a very agile character. (This game is still fun to play though and the combat is improved in The Witcher 2)\nIf you need intense gameplay and won't budge a bit on that need, this game might not be for you.  The gameplay is very minimal and it's very heavily driven by story and atmosphere.  The Witcher excels heavily in these areas though.  I've played it through 2 or 3 times so far.  It's a solid dark fantasy rpg.","May 6, 2015","true","5.9"," 23 of 26 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","23","26","2","1"

As a student, I could only play with a 100% focus + joy during holiday time which is quite short. Hence, I'll be back to this one once I finish the third series for sure.

Each of the attributes, signs, and styles are divided into five tiers with various extra skills associated with each. Because the points are assigned bronze, silver, and gold statuses, it keeps Geralt from getting too powerful in one area too quickly and forces you to make choices later in the game about specialties since silver and gold points are much rarer.\n\n+  Great music and atmosphere\nThe music is excellent, voice work is decent to average, and sound effects are great. The game is good enough to forgive the lip synching problems\n\n+  Graphic is okay for 2007 game\nBeautiful environments. combat animations are terrific and the monster designs are good. Secondary character models aren't spectacular and neither are the random animations.\n\n-  Combat controls might be hard to get used to\nNo key binding settings make the combat controls even harder.\n(at the first time I saw Geralt holding a sword and swinging it around above his head like an idiot, I giggled)\n\nVerdict\n7.5/10","July 27, 2015","true","15.6"," 23 of 26 people (88%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","88","23","26","3","0"

For instance, you may choose to ally yourself with a particular character and follow through with their desires during on particular quest, only for the game to reveal the butterfly effect your decision has had hours later during another quest. On top of this there is no black-and-white right or wrong choice, and many of your actions have both positive and negative effects on the world. The story is well paced, and events escalate believably and the final levels of the game feel like they're building to a well-earned climax. It's a credit to the writers that they have created a story with such depth that every good deed or injustice you enable resonates so strongly.\n\nThe game's weaknesses are mostly related to some bugs and odd design choices, which is a theme that does seem to run through a lot of European-developed RPGs (the Risen and Gothic series' being a more hardcore example of this). For example, the tedium of running around with almost no fast travel becomes a problem very quickly given that many quests will send you back and forth across the map talking to different people. I finished both my 2 playthroughs in about 33 hours each, much of which was spent plodding around the land. I felt a number of times that I just wanted the game to end, and it was almost always because of this backtracking. But, staying around yields its own rewards and this game is far more polished in the Enhanced Edition than any Gothic or Risen game has been.\n\nTechnically, the game shows some dated animation, and the pace is dragged down during in-engine cutscenes, but generally speaking it doesn't look terrible. The combat system isn't particularly inspired, but aside from some annoying camera issues it works.\n\nSince the Witcher series is one in which your choices in-game carry over to each sequel, I'd say it's almost essential that you start back at the first game if you're interested in the story. Whilst it doesn't start with a blank state (and the game frequently fills the player in on characters and events Geralt has interacted with in the books), the games do reference each other a fair bit.\n\nIt's not the world's greatest or most accessible RPG, but it's memorable and to-date one of the only games I've played in which the player choices feel like they're more than just a token gesture.","June 8, 2015","true","65.9"," 16 of 17 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","16","17","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/saitorr/recommended/20900/","saitorr","SaiTorr","http://steamcommunity.com/id/saitorr/","105 products in account","The Witcher: Enhanced Edition is a Story-driven Fantasy RPG based off of a popular series of books written in Poland during the 90s. You play as Geralt of Rivia, who is a monster-slayer, or better known as a Witcher. Assumed dead for Five years, Geralt returns to his fellow Witchers and their stronghold, Kaer Morhen on the same day the Witchers are attacked by a splinter group of bandits known as Salamandra. Geralt and the other Witchers descend into the stretches of the Northern Kingdom to retrieve the stolen secrets of Kaer Morhen. In Geralt's path will follow blood, destruction, and chaos. Though a little long-winded and drenched with lore that will seem daunting to newcomers of the series, The Witcher has an awesome story. Each decision you make has unprecedented consequences and outcomes. The events and characters are heavily laced with underlying moral themes about society, destiny, and consequence. Even now I'm regretting half the decisions I made during my playthrough.\n\nThe RPG mechanics of The Witcher are fairly good, though a little rusty at times. The quests are for the most part pretty interesting, there's a heavy reliance on potion crafting to give you buffs, and the skill system has a nice variety of options to build your character. The main game areas are mini-open worlds separated from chapter to chapter, so all your quest activities take place within the chapter. Everything about this RPG is as you can expect, though my only gripe would have to be about the combat. It's really clunky; consists of clicking every few seconds to build a combo and changing your sword stance based on enemy type. Can't say I hate it, though it could be a lot better.\n\nI have to say The Witcher is a little hard to get into for new players of the series, not to mention the story has a very slow initial burn, but I highly encourage any RPG fan to take a stroll through The Witcher, as it is a highly satisfying and highly intriguing adventure that will leave you reflecting on the complex decisions you made.\n\n8.5/10 - Well worth the asking price (Though this game goes on sale fairly often, get it at 2.00 and it's a steal)","March 21, 2015","true","53.9"," 17 of 19 people (89%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","89","17","19","3","0"

The activity you will spend the majority of your time doing is clicking at the right times.\n\nThe aesthetics are very typical of a "dark fantasy" setting. Expect the following: Nastiness, explicit language (even if ackwardly used), and copious application of Murphy's Law (if something can go wrong it will go wrong). The actual plot is pretty typical genre fiction (the main character is clearly a"Batman" like creation). Like most fantasy settings, their is some tinkering at the margins, but it stays mostly true to the D/D foundation.\n\nThere are some minigames that you probably won't like, as they generally are deritivate of other games or of the main gameplay of this game.\n\nThe game has a couple of gameplay systems the developers use to make you a better "roleplayer"  that make this game worthy of your purchase.\n\n1) You get a card for each time you have sex (always wth a female). The developers use a gameplay system (collection) to  encourage you to have as much sex as possible.  Witcher's are notorious for casual sex because they are infertile and cannot catch a disease. The witcher character would almost always be interested in sex, and this is well documented in the "Witcher" fiction. The developers are encouraging the players to roleplay this aspect of a Witcher's life through gameplay and that's kind of cool.\n\n2) The witchers are always supposed to be neutral between factions. The game articulates this to the player by giving you "story choices" to make. These choices effect quite a bit of the gameplay and yet they rarely reward "good" behavior. The writers try very hard to remove any "good" options from most of the choices you can make. This skews you toward neutrality (or rather selfishness), yet makes you feel that you are the one deciding to be that way. By the end of the game you will probably come to agree with your character's view that all your decisions should be made solely in the best interest of the player character.\n\n- Most games allow you to be a morally righteous night character or a scumbag. This game prods you to exist in between and that's not something that many games allow for.","May 17","true","63.6"," 17 of 19 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","17","19","0","0"

There are great guides to help with Alchemy and Skill trees. Helped me get past the initial confusion. Once you understand the combat and IMPORTANCE of potions. One of the best RPG's ive ever played. There are books on the series of games. I will not delve into those. If you want more lore than go right ahead! Graphics are good for a game made in 2007 8/10. Story is easily a 10/10. Even side quests are captivating. Some tedious, but the story and dialouge you get pushes you on to find out all the secrets and stories! Controls and mechs I give a 6/10. Just a little off putting but learnable. I have to include Cinematic Conversations. Amazing! Every convo you have is like a little movie you decide! Your choices MATTER in this game.

But in the end the experience was more frustrating than enjoyable. There are plenty of reviews talking about the setting and what's great, and there are good things in this game, but here are the things that kept bugging me.\n\n- The environments are huge, but for no reason. There is almost nothing to explore. And because everything is always at opposite ends of the map, you end up running back and forth all the time, fighting lots and lots of irritating low-level enemies on the way.\n- The fighting system seems interesting but ultimately provides little depth. It's way too clumsy to just be enjoyable in an action-rpg sense, and too inconsequential to be interesting to master. Bombs are completely unnecessary, you can upgrade weapons, but you end up getting much better weapons from quests, and magic has very little use except for two spells, and so on...\n- Fights are either stupidly hard or incredibly easy. You either kill the foes easily or you're cornered by a group that spams you with stunning/blinding/something attacks that leave you motionless for several seconds.\n- Characters always end conversations before you're fully done. Rather than allowing you to consistently explore all conversation options and then quit, they end it for you and walk away. That means you may miss an important conversation option and aimlessly wander about looking for the next trigger to continue a quest.\n- Some conversation options only appear once. For example, I tried to play dice with one of the characters. But when I got to the option I wanted to first save the game, so selected "not now", quit the conversation and saved. But after declining once, I never had another chance to start a conversation with the character again, and couldn't finish the quest as a result.\n- Conversations are sometimes random. A character may offer you a product or service in exchange for something else. If you don't happen have what they want on you, you're out of luck since this character may never make you the same offer again. I understand this is more realistic, but this simply doesn't work in a game.\n- Conversations are out of order. Things you can't possibly know yet turn up in conversation. It's confusing.\n- the map marker sometimes isn't helpful at all. For example, you may need to talk to someone, and the map marker will point the character's house. But the NPC will wander about the city rather than be at home, and they're sometimes impossible to find. That would be ok if it was to make things more realistic, and if you could maybe ask other NPC's where you can find the character. But at the same time, the map marker will always show up whether you've explored that part of the map or not. So if you're supposed to get something out of a grave, you'll know exactly where it is whether you've been there before or not. So the argument that it's for realism doesn't really apply.\n- The whole sex-card thing is just plain weird. I don't have an issue with sex in games, but the over-abundance of naked female foes and making sex a collectable ... seriously? It's a strange contrast to the otherwise mature themes of the game.\n\nAnyway, I did finish the game, and there were fun parts. Particularly the last act picked up considerably, mostly because the maps were a bit tighter and there was less back and forth. But in the end I don't think it's nearly as good as people were making it out to be. It's ambitious, but ultimately flawed.\n","August 14, 2014","false","54.5"," 152 of 268 people (57%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","57","152","268","3","1"

This is not where it begins, it begins in the books but that is not important. What is important is that you don't have to know anything about the witcher universe to appreciate and enjoy this game.\n\nNow it took me 3 years to finish this, not because it would be that lenghty! But because I've been recording this for youtube... Alongside many other games and sometimes I've just had a "break" with The Witcher for a while. I have also been playing on standalone DRM free version for a while so my hours played do not reflect the game's lenght.\nThere are grand total of 5 chapters to clear + prologue end epilogue and of course many side quests to complete. I've been doing most of the side-quests and it was my first playthrough. We have 53 videos here, each ~30-32m long so we are looking at something about 26 hours in total (I've been also cuting out backtracking/repeated fights etc etc) so I'd say you are looking at 30-40h adventure in this one for 9.99 (this game is also often on sale, so it's basicly a steal).\n\nThe game is quite old now but it still looks absolutely gorgeous, if you are able to run this on maxed out settings, you are not going to be dissapointed. The Witcher series are known for their outstanding graphics for the time they are released after all. It's like Final Fantasy series and their cutscenes, always out of this world.\n\nThe story is interesting, it starts you off as the Witcher that is brought back basicly to his "home" which is a Castle where all the Witchers are trained. Our protagonist doesn't remember anything about his past and he have been missing for a long time already. Instead of a nice relaxing day something is going to happen. Strange group of people break in and they are after the mutagens that are necesary for a human to become a Witcher. Witchers have almost superhuman abilities and can drink potions that would kill an ordinary human, of course someone would be after this "power". So you take on a Journey and you are after these people. It's going to get really complicated and you'll have to kill alot of beasts, monsters and people to get to the conclusion. You'll also have a few moments to spend with some nice ladies that you meet along the way. I've been told that there are more ending. At the end you are basicly told what happened.\n\nNow the combat system. I found this part to be weak or at least weaker than the rest of the game's mechanics. Sure there's some depth in it. You have a steel sword for humans, silver sword for mutants/monsters etc. Witch each sword The Witcher can use 3 styles for big slow monsters/people, for small fast monsters/people and for fighting a large group. If you are not sure what to use at a specific moment, you might find yourself dead pretty soon as witcher might not be able to lande a hit if you are attacking this small dude with a style that's ment for big encounters. You also have signs (is that how it's called in English?) basicly magic. There's 6 of them I believe but I found myself using mostly Igni and igni only (it shoots flames in a wide area that damages and catches your enemies on fire). So you can switch between those too. but it's rather simple as far as the actuall fight goes. you click a monster and you wait untill the sword icon (that's basicly your mouse cursor) changes so you know you can click again and The Witcher will continue his successful hits, there's nothing to it really.\n\nThan you have a chance to do some alchemy and craft potions that will help you in many situations like dark areas so you can see like a cat. Or simple things like health regen, instant healing etc. Than you have special potions that you can craft only after you kill a certain boss. Usually giving you some talent points. For each level you get talent points that you can spend to improve your skills. The skills are quite interesting. Adding more combos for your styles or more effects to your abilities (magic/signs), nothing boring like "+3 strenght" so big + for that!\nAnd you do all of this while meditating. You need a fireplace or a campfire to meditate. I feel like this is unnecesary but it also makes sense. Witcher meditates and focuses his energy to gain more power, yeah but it's just prolonging the process and it can be quite confusing at first. Nothing you can't get used to mind you!\n\nThe conclusion; If you don't own this game and you like RPGs, get this! It's a fun game that still looks great and it's cheap as potatoes. While the combat systeam and meditation mechanics might not be the best, they are nothing you can't get over and just enjoy the great, easy to follow story.","February 24, 2015","true","19.0"," 14 of 17 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","14","17","0","1"

The design of the game is fresh and exotic, it feels natural though because it's designed with the perspective of a western audience even though the game is foreign. So let's begin:\n\nAesthetics: 7.80/10\nThe Witcher introduces it's pallete quite unctuously in a way that really builds up expectation however it remains constant and bland, yet dark and truculent therefore it might bore players initially and won't pique their interest for a good portion of the game, it's not colorful by any means although it is atmospheric. The animations are nice but the game lacks a lot of vital sound effects de-effectively reducing the drama in action cutscenes. The music contributes a lot to the score, as it accompanies the game quite effectively, it's good music and catchy, although I do wish there was more melodic variety.\n\nStory/Characters: 9.50/10\nThe story and characters are by far the best feature the game has to offer, at times I felt like abandoning the game due to it's repetiveness in cliche' mechanics but the story grabbed me by the brain and held on to me like a clingy newborn pup. It piqued by intellect and engaged me to learn more about the universe and it's precocious story, the characters were friendly and interesting, especially Geralt, which I fell in love with progressively (no homo) as the story unfolded. The game touches some enticing (mature?) themes, (racial prejudice, slavery, drug abuse, politics) and respects your intelligence, never treating you like an idiot.\n\nMechanics/Gameplay: 6.20/10\nSadly, the gameplay is tedious, fun, but tedious and annoying. There is a lot of micro managing that is quite loathsome and a boring combat system. The potion creation system however is completely satisfying to use, I do like the concept of gathering rare materials to create a new spell and gathering formulas to create new ones. Some potions felt useless and annoying to make as if they were made for another game, but that's besides the point. The game also has a spell system that is insanely over-powered and that completely overshadows the silver/steel sword system. At one point in time, I never even used my swords, I just spammed igni and gg.\n\nFinal Verdict: 8.60/10\nWhat can I say? I stayed for the story and the characters with the universe grabbing me from the balls to stay. The world is engaging and alive and it really embraces the notion of intellectual players, although the gameplay might be bland, this game is a masterful craft and allows room for bigger and better things.\n\nTL;DR: Buy it for the story, leave feeling smart.","July 2, 2014","true","35.8"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","2"

Easily the most attractive feature to the game. It's one of those stories you think about a lot throughout the day, like a good book you want to just jump right back into as soon as you have the time.\n\nWealth of Content\n- The game easily has 75+ hours worth of content. Tons of interesting side quests. Side goals like Romance Cards, Poker games, or Gear Collecting. There is even an adventure editor to make your own stories or play someone else's creation.\n\nThe little things / Ambiance\n- The Witcher had so many little things that made the game an enjoyable experience. Whether it was the peaceful music that tied into the artfully crafted landscapes or the NPC dynamics (I.e: The towns people running for cover when it rained or conversing about recent things that happened in the area) you can tell the developers put in plenty of personal touch to make the game special.\n\n\nCons\nCharacter Models\n- The character models in this game are god awful. Most Npc and Key Characters have absolutely no facial expressions. It would completely take you out of the immersion. Its extremely hard to feel attached or anything of the sort when someone who is supposed to be emotional has the mightiest poker face I've ever seen.\nA lot of models would have little off things that would take away from the seriousness of the game, for example, King Foltest ( A Key Character) would have his elbows bent way too far, which made him look disturbing and unnatural, causing you to lose attention from whatever he was speaking about.\nAnother thing is that they would reuse or recycle models for npcs, even key characters. It's very strange to see someone important being used later in the game as a normal NPC filler. (I.e The Vivaldi Banker Dwarf; Its disappointing to see him walk around a battlefield as you run up expecting some reasons why he was there, only to find out He is some random NPC with 2 lines of dialogue. This happens a lot during the game)\n\nAnimations / Cutscenes\n- The animations are extremely poor. They all feel like they are in slow motion when they aren't supposed to be. Again it all feels unnatural and horrid looking. When it wasn't extremely slow action scenes it was abruptly placed concept art style narrations. These narrations would sometimes not make sense because they were placed oddly and almost make it so it would cut off NPC dialog.\n\nCombat\n- The combat in the game, which makes up a lot of the game, is a bit clunky. None of the action of the combat is fluid. You'd stop often out of place to start your next combo. It isn't as bad as some other things in the game, but not good either.\n\nFinal Verdict: 6.5/10\nPersonal Opinion:\nI would be lying if I said I didn't enjoy this game. Sadly there were many things holding this game back from being so much more. The developers could have easily put in a bit more effort to make things look less lazy to bring this game to a 8/10 or 8.5/10. I'm not sure how some of these things made it past them. Reguardless I had fun while playing it. The story was amazing and made me keep coming back for more. If you have the time and are intrested the story of the witcher, this is no doubt a fun game to play through. If not, you can read up most of the plot  here	[witcher.wikia.com] and move on to The Witcher 2.","May 29, 2015","true","51.5"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

But finally you get used to it ;o) Well, sometimes that doesn't do what exactly is supposed to as you have to choose the right sword first - depends if you fight a creature or a humanoid - and then you have to choose the style of your fight and here begin the trouble as sometimes you reach the target but finally that wasn't the good option and sometimes you had the good one but you missed every time.\nIn fact that the biggest and mostly only complaint I have against this game. Every other aspect is great nonetheless: great scenario with quite a good bunch of third parties quest, nice ambiance music, graphic very well done (mostly when we know that is a 2008 game!), the dialogue system nicely put (you have to make a choice between the different option you get as it will have some impact for the rest of the game), the alchemic system not so difficult to understand and which could help you a lot and finally you had lots of information regarding the history/explanation of the different people you will meet during the game, the monsters, the places etc.\n\nSo as you can imagine I warmly recommend this game for every gamers who like RPG, I'm sure you won't regret it!\n\n-------------------------\n\nUn des meilleurs RPG auquel j'ai joué!\n\nUn superbe jeu sur plusieurs plans malgré quelques défauts comme le système de combat qui ne répond pas aussi vite ou précisément que l'on souhaite. Mais on finit par s'y habituer :) Mais des fois cela ne fait pas exactement ce que c’est supposer faire du fait que vous devez d’abord choisir le bon type d’arme en premier – selon si vous devez vous battre contre une créature ou un humanoïde – et après vous devez choisir le style de combat et c’est là que les problèmes commencent car des fois vous arrivez à atteindre votre cible alors que ce ne sont pas les bonnes options choisies et des fois vous avez les bonnes options mais vous rater votre cible à chaque fois.\nCela dit, c’est la plus grosse récrimination que j’aurais envers ce jeu. Tous les autres aspects sont excellents : un très bon scénario avec pas mal de quêtes annexes, excellente musique d’ambiance, graphique très bien fait (surtout quand on sait que c’est un jeu de 2008!), le système de dialogue bien mis en place (vous devez faire un choix entre les options que vous avez car cela aura de l’influence sur le reste du jeu), l’alchimie pas trop compliqué à comprendre et qui pourra beaucoup vous aider et enfin vous pouvez avoir beaucoup d’information à propos de l’histoire / explication des différents protagonistes que vous allez rencontrer durant le jeu, les monstres, les régions visitées etc.\n\nDonc comme vous pouvez l’imaginer je recommande chaudement ce jeu pour tous les amateurs de RPG, je suis sûr que vous ne le regretterez pas!","April 13, 2015","true","63.7"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","12","15","0","0"

A tale of one gamer's journey into the world of The Witcher 1, a uniquely, captivating Fantasy cRPG from 2007.  What was I was doing at the time, so long ago?  Shooting Reapers dead and becoming a Warden;  that is until a friend told me about a little known game to me that I might enjoy which went something like, "So I know you like classic games, you should check this out!  Its an RPG game about a Monster Hunter named Geralt of Rivia and its awesome!"\n\nCould it be true, was it "awesome"?\n\nWell lets take a gander...\n\nI feel like I'm in a Medieval Simulator... but there are elves and magic?\nThe first Witcher game came as a bit of a surprise back in 2007 with other big-name titles coming out around the same time period.  It was released, by now, well known Polish developer group CD Projekt that thought there just wasn't enough, good grim-dark Medieval Fantasy games based on a series of novels, that first became popular in Poland, and that needed to be corrected immediately!\n\nAs many may know by now (or not), the game is based on the excellent book series by Adrezej Sapkowski in which you play as Geralt of Rivia, a monster hunter for hire, known as a "Witchers" or "Wiedźmin" - whom are basically Medieval Warrior Monks, from an alternate 1200s Scandinavian-like land, cool right? - "but what do the books have to do with the game" you ask? I'll get to that at the end, but firstly what to expect out of this review:  My honest take on the game (The Enhanced Version) and what you can expect, either as someone brand new to this series or those more accustomed to the later games.\n\nThe Basics    An engaging, mystery story-line, that'll make you want to know more about "Who is Geralt?" and the world of the Witcher\nInteresting side-quests, besides the Monster Hunting variety\nChoices that actually matter in sometimes subtle and also big ways (multiple variations on Game Ending)\nOutstanding soundtrack by Paweł Błaszczak & Adam Skorupa that absolutely FITS the stark Medieval setting perfectly (seriously "River of Life" brought a tear to my eye!) and the action music will get you in the mood for combat!\nClassic take on RPG-tropes with some familiar elements to level (Strength, Dexterity, Stamina, Intelligence) with a uniquely in-universe twist by leveling the types of Magic Witchers use and leveling combat styles (Strong, Fast, Group)\nUnique Combat / Semi-Active Combo Sword mini-game/system (best way to describe it)\nOne all encompassing menu that lets you easily switch from your items, character screen, journal, and so on\nThe coolest Alchemy mechanics I've seen in a video game (You can experiment and make potions in a way that seems semi-realistic, even making unknown ones if you mix the right ingredients!)\nSome DetractorsSaving is your Friend, DO IT!  The game does still have crashing issues (I was able to resolve this with a "4GB" patch - but you will have to search that on your own)\nThe camera during dialogue can sometimes go off-center and suddenly you'll be speaking to someone's chest (Why is Geralt staring at Dandelion's Bardly chest?)\nThe game may not get along with Steam Overlay (You may need to turn it off in your Steam settings)\nWhile there are many strengths such as the story, there are some things to consider...\nCombat can be deeply entertaining or overwhelming or potentially frustrating.  As you may have heard from word of mouth or other reviews, the combat is not to everyone's liking.  You are either going to like it or not;  imagine a game like KOTOR or Elder Scrolls where you are standing in place hitting the enemy, but now in addition you'll complete combos for increasingly more insane damage and acrobatics, by clicking your mouse when prompted;  additionally you have magic to use;  you have two types of swords for use on certain targets ; PLUS "Combat Stances" that determine your likelihood to hit whatever type of target you are facing (a "fast" or "slow/strong" opponent) - In truth, the combination of all these were overwhelming at first, but fascinating to me at the same time as there is really not much else like it in other games.  Over time I mastered the combat with practice so it can require patience.  I recommend watching videos or playing a friend's copy as there is no demo.\nThis isn't a "make your own character kind" of RPG;  you are Geralt of Rivia whom has his own history already laid out in the previous novels, but you can choose your stats and how you build him into a Medieval Monster Hunting Badass, and you can choose how to approach parts of the storyline\nWhile the story generally tells you where to go and who to speak to next;  there are other parts not so obvious and require you to really think and explore as traditional, classic RPG's tend to do;  There are some excellent guides[www.gamefaqs.com] out there though and there's certainly nothing wrong with that if you feel overwhelmed on any part of the game.\nThe graphics are based on the Bioware Aurora engine and was very nice for its day in 2007 comparatively with other big-name titles from that time - Certainly a dated look compared to games NOW, so if you absolutely must play bleeding-edge technology, this game is probably not for you.  On the other hand, if you do play older titles or often find yourself buying classic games on Steam or GOG, then this game may become that unknown gem as it did for me.\nSummary\nFor a game based on an established series of novels and comics, with its own set of characters and setting, this is one of the best book-to-video game Third Person RPG's I have ever seen.  In that way, it is definitely unique and manages to bring to life the world of the Witcher.  While the game isn't without its own set of flaws, the great story writing, pleasant music, and unique style have certainly made it a classic... as the tale goes.\n\nOther Information FAQ - Potential Spoilers\nHow is this game different from the second or third game in the series?  The combat in the first game is one of the main differences here compared to the rest of the trilogy - it is very much "classic" based and stat-driven (dexterity determining if you get hit or not for instance as you stand in place) compared to the much for "active" action-style gameplay of the other titles.  In addition, in the Witcher 1, Geralt is mainly the one narrating his journal; the Alchemy in Witcher 1 was a bit deeper and seemingly for complex, since it lets you experiment more.\n\nSo you keep mentioning these books, do I need to read those to understand the game?  No, not necessarily - the game provides enough reading into the various characters and background information.  You will however know much, much more by reading them and gain a clearer understanding of the fictional world that Geralt resides in and his relation to the characters.  The Witcher Saga is one of only a few favorite Medieval Fantasy series for me that I did not start reading until after playing the first game - its right up there with Tolkien or Game of Thrones.  I highly recommend them if you enjoy reading.  Basically it goes like this - The Witcher Saga books are like The Original Trilogy of Star Wars, while the games are the "Extended Universe" that are a continuation of the story.","May 19, 2015","true","94.4"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","3"

It’s got intrigue, it’s got monsters and it’s got my favourite ever soundtrack for a game. You also get a TON of free stuff with the game, including a PDF guide and the previously mentioned soundtrack. There is a catch though, well 2 catches: the first is that it doesn’t look very good and the second is that the combat is terrible. Both of these things have been true since the game was released in 2006.\n\nIf you are able to get through the tutorial and the first chapter of this game, which is no easy feat considering how horrendous the combat feels and how wooden some of the voice acting is – you’ll be able to get through the entire game, and you will love it. The Witcher asks an awful, awful lot from people who come to play it – but once you’ve committed for those first 3 hours, you’ll find youself caught up in the game world and the story more than anything else. There’s a real sense of momentum once things get going and this game really is best enjoyed in 5 or 6 binge sessions over the period of 2 weeks to a month – it’ll take about 30 hours to play through in total.\n\nIf you read this and think that the time commitment required to play is too much, or you don’t think the mechanics are good enough for you, then fair enough.

It was the studio's first released game. This game is The Witcher.\n\nAfter having The Witcher in my games library for a long time and seeing the strong reception its sequels have gotten, I decided not long ago to finally play it through, start to finish, as part of a greater plan to run through the entire Witcher trilogy. I'm glad I did. The Witcher is not without noticeable flaws, but is a decent game in my opinion.\n\nVery Different from Its Successors\n\nI want to note early in this review that The Witcher is powered by a very heavily modified Aurora Engine - the same engine that powered Bioware and Obsidian's Neverwinter Nights games. CD Projekt has come a long way since 2007 and the more recent REDengine is a far cry from the aging Aurora. If someone comes from the second or third game to see where the series started, they might be in for some big surprises, as the interface and combat are very different from the sequels. It may take some time to get used to!\n\nCombat, Alchemy, and Item Use\n\nCombat in The Witcher has a great deal of depth to it, but its mechanics may not appeal to everyone, so I will explore it in depth.\n\nThe Witcher's combat is fundamentally based on maintaining a mouse clicking rhythm in order to chain up attacks on a selected opponent. Each mouse click does not correspond to an individual swing but rather initiates an attack animation that may have multiple swings in it. Clicking at the right moments continues the chain and makes Geralt initiate increasingly elaborate and damaging attacks. Clicking at the wrong time or too rapidly will disrupt and reset the chain. Dodging and parrying are basically automatic. Although you can direct Geralt to spin past enemies or jump over them by double tapping a movement key, these maneuvers are generally more useful for getting into a better fighting position than actually evading an attack.\n\nThe real complexity of The Witcher's combat comes from the various systems laid on top of the basic attack chaining, including choosing the correct weapon to fight your foes, choosing the right combat stances, using magic, and using alchemy. Geralt has silver and steel swords with different purposes and three different combat styles to chose from at any time: a strong style for fighting large opponents, a fast style for agile foes, and a group style for eliminating crowds of enemies in arcs all around him. Proper use of magic permits Geralt to stun opponents, set them on fire, or immobilize them with pain. It can even let him execute spectacular and brutal instant kill attacks in combination with his swordplay.\n\nThe alchemy system is interesting and serves as one of the main reasons to loot opponents. Monsters almost never carry new weapons, but their organs can be used to make useful potions and bombs. Potions can last for several in-game hours, as do grindstones used to sharpen Geralt's swords, or oils created to temper his weapons versus specific foes. There is strong incentive to prepare heavily for combat long before entering it and to know your enemies' weaknesses in advance of fighting them. At its best, combat in The Witcher combines strategy and tactics with extremely satisfying results.\n\nEnvironments, Sound, Story, and Consequences\n\nThe Witcher is a game with beautiful environments and the modified Aurora engine actually does a good job of rendering both urban and wilderness maps. Overall the game world feels well crafted with praiseworthy attention to detail. I will note that I did see a few graphical oddities, but they ceased once I forced V-sync with my graphics card. In terms of sound, the game has some very well done music tracks that give a lot of life to the game world.\n\nAs one probably expects, the best part of The Witcher is the story and how Geralt's actions affect his world. The plot is immersive and your actions do matter. One thing I really liked was that after making a major choice and eventually seeing the consequences, you would get a cutscene with an illustration of what has transpired in the style of a storybook. During the cutscene, Geralt will narrate on the effects of that choice, giving some insight into how this has affected the world. There's a decent number of these throughout the game, usually associated with major quests, and they were one of my favorite parts of the game. I also give special praise to the design of the chapter endings, which were universally strong and usually brought a climatic resolution to the plotlines that were devevloped throughout each chapter. I also felt that Geralt's dry wit was highly amusing, much as it rubbed some of the non-player characters the wrong way.\n\nThere is also a decent sense of progression in the game as Geralt levels up, builds his identity, and relearns witcher magic. It does take time, as some of the upgrades the player can purchase on leveling up are relatively small, but it is very satisfying witnessing Geralt tear through hordes of opponents in the endgame after starting so humbly in the prologue.\n\nFlaws\n\nAlthough this is an overall positive review, The Witcher is not without noticeable flaws. Even though the environment is detailed, the placement of the world geometry on some of the maps, especially in the various swamp areas, can make traveling through them much more time consuming and annoying than it needed to be.\n\nFor many, the biggest flaw will simply be the combat system. At its worst, the combat in The Witcher devolves into a dull repetition of waiting for the attack prompts to appear over and over. If one finds the rhythm based clicking and management of sword styles unappealing or was expecting control over the individual swings, blocks, and parries, their enjoyment of The Witcher's combat will be severely limited. Furthermore, there are occasionally oddities in hit detection and movement attributable to the mechanics of the Aurora engine. I did not let these hurt my experience, but I recognized them from having previously played the Neverwinter Nights series.\n\nAnd much as I praised the story overall earlier, the game does have some pacing problems. In my opinion, this was most noticeable in the early game. The prologue is excellent as the attack on Kaer Morhen serves as a good impetus for Geralt's quests, but chapters one and two can go very slowly at times. Both of them have excellent climaxes at the chapter endings, but the gameplay in the middle can sometimes feel like it is moving at a crawl with too much repetitive traveling through the same villages and swamps. This is compounded by some quest design problems, as I feel that a number of quests were executed somewhat badly, resulting in confusion, tedium, or both. There is also some uneven dialogue and subpar voice acting that simply does not match the quality of other parts of the game.\n\nAll that said, I did not find these problems overwhelming and when the game really hit its stride, it was extremely compelling.\n\nSumma Summarum\n\nI really enjoyed The Witcher, but will also readily admit that it has its share of flaws. Provided one is forgiving of the game's rougher portions and is willing to put up with some aged mechanics, I do recommend this game.  It also sets up very nicely for import into Assassins of Kings for those interested in playing the entire trilogy from start to finish. I know I'm looking forward to continuing my game into the sequel and then into The Wild Hunt.","October 12, 2015","true","48.0"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","8","8","2","1"

There are lots of subquests, and many of them refers to history experiences, and the main protagonist isn't finally the guy, who "protects the world from evil, and reaches the kingdom. [...]".

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/aprofilehere/recommended/20900/","aprofilehere","Gunderson Mallard","http://steamcommunity.com/id/aprofilehere/","2360 products in account","In Witcher you follow around some guy named Geralt, who looks like he just hit his midlife crisis. Lucky for him, he has amnesia and doesn't remember anything. Much to everyone's disappointment though, he doesn't forget how to be extremely boring.\n\nGeralt has many redeeming qualities like being in heat all the time and nothing else. I don't know how he sleeps with enough women to populate a large village, but he does, and it's as sad as it sounds. Watching Geralt  try to seduce women is like watching your recently divorced father beg a Wal Mart greeter for a date.\n\nWhat's worse than that though? The game doesn't let you forgot your moment of shame because it drops a card in your journal to remind you of that proud moment when started collecting video game women like trophies. They might as well include a fedora and self help book with the game.\n\nAfter you take a shower to wash away all that sleaze, you can enjoy... Oh no wait, this is when the developers thought slow clicking and micromanaging how dumb your character looks would make for a great combat system. Well don't worry about that, because after all the grinding you get to spend your hard earned points on thrilling, state-of-the-art skills that mostly just increase your main damage or some other vague damage that doesn't really matter. All the different damages and micromanaging seem like a failed attempt to add some depth to battles.\n\nAnd you definitely won't forget how mature this game is: every other character uses cuss words like they don't understand how language works, but that's ok because no character seems to know how being memorable works. When the writing isn't too busy being vulgar for no reason, it also finds time to show how grown up it is by throwing around morality and politics like the clumsy kid in gym class.\n\nYou might be thinking "Wow that sounds negative, how can you be recommending this?"\nWell here is how this little trick works: Just copy and paste the second word of every sentence and that's what my actual review says!\n\nJust kidding. But seriously, I enjoyed this game despite the flaws and I was pretty swept up by it.","July 18, 2014","true","12.2"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","100","7","7","4","0"

One of my favourite RPGs from now on.\n\nI had to admit, I could only play it through for the third time I started it, yet, I feel this is just something that everyone has to try out. At first glance, it may seem a little complex and boring (because of the alchemy stuff for example), but once you get into it, you just can't stop. The choices you have to make, actually make you think about the world in the game. I can say, that I totally got familiar with my character in the game, I was able to make choices that were really mine. The story sucks you in, and after  40-50 hours of gameplay, and finishing the game, you just still want more of it. And that's the time you buy The Witcher 2. :)\n\nOh, and a good advice for newcomers to the game. Make sure you do a lot of alchemy, you'll need  it mostly in mid-game.\n\nI haven't played the second game, so I don't know how much the game got improved after this.\n\nOf course, The Witcher also has some negative aspects. Actually, it has a bunch of it, at first it may not seem like an AAA game, but believe me, it is. One of the worst aspect is the voice acting. I played it in Hungarian, which, in my opinion was  actually not that bad, but as I tried out the English version, I just couldn't stand it. Another little negative thing is, that sometimes you have to do a lot of running, between quest givers, or merchants to sell all the loot you just can't carry. One thing that troubled me about the story is, that in the beginning there's a lot of references in the game which you know nothing about, but by reading in-game books and talking to people, you can get to know a lot about The Witcher's lore.\n\nRegarding everything, as I already said above, this gem became one of my favourite RPGs of all time. Another good thing is, that you can import your saved games to The Witcher 2, however I don't know how much will it affect the second game, yet.\n\nIf you read my review to this point, then I only have one more thing to say.\n\nGo, and play this game!","July 18, 2014","true","49.2"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

I believe that holds my highest replay rate of any game I have ever played and I have been gaming since 95. As someone who is a huge RPG nut this game hits every spot we RPG people are looking for. I will now go into the reasons why the Witcher 1 is absolutely worth playing and if you want to play Witcher 2 and 3 you should NOT skip this game in the franchise.\n\nThe world. The game world has a dark feel to it, based in realism, rascism, and people being what they are so commonly capable of being. Monsters. The games are based of Novels from Polish author Andrzej Sapkowski who created a world deep in political and personal intrigue. This is one of those games you Game of Thrones fans can appreciate as well. Nothing is as it seems and never take a coin without thinking of the consequences.This game makes you think. It lets you play how you want, you can remain neutral (as Witchers are sworn to take no part in the matters of the human world similar to Grey Wardens). Their concern is monster hunting and profit from such activities. You can take sides, with benefits and downfalls. The game leaves choice to the player. That is what makes the world so amazing.\n\nThe sound and graphic design still holds strong as a game from 2007. The graphics and a majority of bugs and content were added in the enhanced edition. Which was CD Projekt red's way of saying we are sorry the initial launch was so rough and pretty bad to be honest. That is a moot point now, as the game looks great still to this day and plays quite well. The voice acting is quite good and enjoyable, although there are only a few voice actors for as many characters as there are. So expect to hear the same voice actor more than once. Geralt has one of the best voices of any bad ♥♥♥ in any game ever as far as I amconcerened.\n\nThe gameplay. In my opinion the UI and quest system is superior to Witcher 2 because it was\nbuilt for a mouse and keyboard where as Witcher 2 was sadly designed around a console UI (sigh) I expect the Witcher 3 to be the same sadly. Anyway the combat system will turn most people away from this game and one reason I enjoy it as much as I do. As a fan of the Dark Forces games from Lucas Arts such as Jedi Outcast and Jedi academy their combat was styled around the "stances" play. Where you would need a different fighting style to tackle different enemies effectively. Strong, Medium and Fast. The Witcher uses this system and I do love it. The combat comes down to chaining attacks effectively for devistating combos and executions. A lot of people think its repetative and boring and to be honest I can understand but if you enjoy the fighting style in the first place you will be\nright at home with the combat in the Witcher.\n\nThat being said, this game for the sake of having a deeper appreciation and understanding of the\ngames world play the first one. It is an excellent RPG that has aged well even if it is a little\nclunky. Your armor, weapons and some major decisions carry over into the Witcher 2 and seemingly into Witcher 3 if we are lucky. So if you are one of those Mass Effect, Dragon Age fans who love choice and consequences reoccuring in your games. The Witcher series is among the finest if not\nthe best.\n\nGive this game a shot. It is fantastic. I hope this review helps you people on the fence to give it a try.\n10/10","April 29, 2015","true","89.2"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","10","13","0","0"

I'll admit - I was one of the naysayers - I played this game a couple years back. Gave it an hour or two of my time. However I just couldn't get over the hurdle of combat. It didn't feel right, fruitlessly clicking to time your attacks. It felt clunky, disjointed. I tossed it into the backlog and thought nothing of it.\n\nI gave it a second chance recently, due to all the Witcher 3 hype, and am thoroughly glad I did. Yes, the terrible combat mechanics are still there, but they are not even nearly as bad as I thought them to be in my first attempt at playing. Behind all this lies a deep and engrossing storyline that makes you care about the characters and the areas in which you frequent.\n\nThere are many choices in the game that change the course of the story as you go. Actions have consequences - it usually ends up as the lesser of two evils. The game has an overall 'dirty' feel to it - towns aren't entirely 'happy' and cheerful. You see things like racism, foul language, and general debauchery. You can even go so far as to sleep with many different women, who are more than happy to provide you 'trading cards' showing off their, ahem, assets. Its things like this however, that greatly set it apart from other RPGs, which is certainly welcoming as a lot of other games utilize the 'cookie cutter' approach far too often. Its good to be 'bold' with your games, and I highly respect companies like CD Projekt for doing so.\n\nThe game has three difficulty settings - I recommend playing on hardest. It's really not all that hard, aside from a boss fight or two, but it makes you rely on using alchemy and potions, as well as utilizing sword stances and parries/dodging. It really brings out the best in the game and gives it a steady pace as you progress through it.\n\nAt its core, the game plays like most other action RPGs, but you do have to time your mouse clicks to chain attack combos, which has notably been this game's biggest shortcoming. Otherwise, you have your typical potions and buffs/food, alchemy ingredients, and a few weapons here and there (you only swap armor literally once). The focus is less on the loot, more on the story. However the 'less is more' approach tends to lend more weight to the new items you acquire, and gives you a better appreciation of them.\n\nYou can level up quite often, and the game has a skill tree where you can upgrade talents based on your traditional stats such as strength, dexterity, etc., as well as a few magical spells you use (you have a total of 5 spells, but they, much like the weapons I mentioned above, have more weight to them and are very useful). You can also upgrade your sword techniques from here. There are a multitude of potions you can craft, which result from collecting herbs and ingredients on your journeys. The key to fights are finding hints and literature before approaching most monsters, and preparing accordingly with potions or oils.\n\nOverall, The Witcher is a very well rounded game. Its graphics are older, but still hold up well today. It presents much of the same RPG elements but injects many other angles that make it unique and memorable. I definitely recommend this game if you have the time for it. It took me about 48 hours to beat (my time says 51, but I do not count the 2-3 hours from my original attempt a while ago). I didn't rush through it, did about 85-90% of side quests, and took my time. Enjoy it for the story, and remember that there's no wrong way to play this game. Live with your choices and press on. The story of Geralt of Rivia is an amazing one, and you won't regret it.","May 16, 2015","true","51.9"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

During my playthrough, I really enjoyed the game and when I was not playing it, I was dreaming about playing it :). It is one of the best games and best story RPGs that I have played, it is really intense, has an awesome story, lovely progression system and a great game alltogether that really makes me feel awesome. Normally, I would be sad after finishing such a game. However, it is awesome that I had the possibility to import the save games in the Witcher 2 and the adventure will continue :D.\n\nYou play the Game as Geralt of Rivia, one of the best warriors in the game world and also a witcher, belonging to a guild of monster slayers. The game takes you through beautiful medieval castles, cities and villages. The story is very intense and you have many decisions which affect the game and COMPLETELY change the main story. Some little sudden and seemingly insignificant decision somewhere in the game might have an effect in a further quest very close by, or maybe in the next chapter after 10 more hours of gameplay or maybe even towards the culmination of the story. I just loved how my decisions not only mattered but shaped the story in a completely different course to the other choices. This game is awesome. From a graphics point of view, the graphics are beautiful. I enjoyed seeing the big city of Temeria with all it's huts, medieval fortificantions, swamps, villages, beautiful fields and more. The game also runs smoothly, with no bugs. The combat is very awesome, very fun and addictive.  There are also many interesting things about it such as enhancing your weapons, preparing bombs, potions, using oils, magic.\n\nI really also loved how the game  has a discovery feeling to it. You encounter certain monsters in the wonderful world. Then you might hear a story about them or read a book about them to give you more information and tell you about some valuable ingredients for your potions that you can take from them. I really liked how nothing was random in this game, every monster species has its own purpose, own description, own location and time in which it appears, own secret book to find about them, own quest or quests involving them.\n\nAfter travelling in this game through such a fantastic fantasy filled with great characters, stories, lovely places (the city, fields and water will tell you of another gorgeous world which exists beyond our own), I feel awesome and will probably start the Witcher 2 today. Thank you, developers, 10/10, 100% recommended, one of the most beautiful games you ca play, like reading an awesome book or seeing a great, memorable movie, but here you are it's awesome hero.","August 4, 2015","true","71.4"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

The Witcher is an immensive RPG game developed by CD Projekt RED, a famous Polish game company and its legacy for enhanced role playing mechanics. The game is less known in the United States, but got highly praised reviews for one of the greatest RPG in the decade. Unlike the majority of games in the market, The Witcher has a very complex story and excellent political intrigue that will grab your attention. While most RPG games has a clear distinction on moral choices between good and evil, The Witcher puts the player on tough choices to choose and have a direct impact to the storyline (without the importance of morality in the game) as many choices are in the shades of gray. This demonstrates that moral choices is not necessary to be in RPG games. In addition, The Witcher: Enhanced Edition has a very immersive soundtrack that will immediately seek your attention. There are plenty of side quests to do and certain decisions will affect the entire game and few major choices will go directly to its sequel, The Witcher 2.\n\nIn the game, you play as Geralt of Rivia (known as the White Wolf) who seeks justice against the Salamandra who attack his camp, Kaer Morhen,  and kills one of his allies. While the Salamndra storyline is the main plot,  Geralt faced a society that is conflicted by two distinctive factions: The Order and the Scoia'tael. The Order is a specialzed human organization that cracksdown uprisings and use brute force to silence nonhuman insurgencies, but displays a change in reformation within the organization for tolerance. The other faction is the Scoia'tael, the nonhuman (dwarfs, elves, etc.) insurgent group that have the ideologies of independence and freedom for everyone, but their methods are unorthodox by putting so many members on suicide battles and radical methods to destroy human societies. Arguably, one of the best parts in The Witcher has to be the political intrigue in the main storyline.The Witcher: Enhanced Edition is a lengthy 40-60 hour game that immerses you with its beautiful soundtrack, complex choices and dialogue variety.

I wanted to savour the mature storyline and it's richly detailed world. The game has 70+ hours if you do most of the sidequesting and you're trying to get all the girls (Yes, you can have sex with many of the women in the game - but all you get is the same blurry animation and a nude or seminude card of them). Hence you often get distracted from your main goal and the main story tends to become secondary to all your conquests.  The only problem with the Witcher is that because it is so long it tends to get repetitive, a lot of fetch quests and back and forth travelling (no fast travel) and specially the same NPC models returning for different characters on the new towns and villages. Even the enhanced edition feels like it could have been more polished with a few extra models (for old ladies and beggars for example - there's only one for each kind), even the women have limited models, you have the peasant woman, the town girl, the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, the nun and of course the elves and druids but after 40 hours of gameplay you get tired of always finding the same innkeeper and women in each town. Nevertheless you will want to own this game just to watch the epic CGI opening and closing sequences and to try the rather original if not entirely satisfying combat system;  or, if you don't have the time, just try the flash parody game 'the ♥♥♥♥♥er', it basically gets the gist.","June 9, 2015","true","78.0"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

I understand that the game was based on the book series which gives it an advantage, but there are also other games that tried to do it the same way and failed. Hats off to the developers behind this masterpiece.\nscore: 99/100 (-1 because of the crashes which were annoying and I don't know why they were happening)","January 4, 2014","true","55.2"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","1"

I'm also not here to make comparisons between the games and books. This is a game review only.\nIf I could give this game a rating between thumbs up and thumbs down... say, like, a fist... I would do that, because my opinion is very mixed. But since I have more negative things to say than positive, I have to give it a thumbs down.\nI'm not out to "get" you if you enjoy this game, and what makes the world go 'round are differences in opinions. Do not take my criticisms as personal attacks on you and understand that reviews are opinions, and nothing will make me reassess mine. If you want to yell at me about my opinion and tell me how wrong I am and that I'm just some "simpleton", understand that nothing is going to change my mind, so you're only wasting your own time. This review is based on my own experiences with the game and how I reacted to it. Know that not everyone will experience a game the same way.\nWhat I liked about the game:1) In The Witcher, there are some pretty decent RPG elements. I like the leveling system, for one. I enjoy the fact that Strength, Dexterity, Endurance, and Intelligence have their own trees to pick from, and that you can also level up your weapons.\n\n2) The characters are amusing. Well, the male ones, anyway. The female ones are just sex dispensers with legs. I’ll get to that later.\n\n3) I love the alchemy. The starting potions are very “meh” but later you can craft much better ones and be practically unkillable. I also love picking up herbs to craft potions.\n\n4) The game on normal is just that: normal. Some games I’ve played on normal (especially fantasy RPGs) seem like the developers misunderstood what “normal” difficulty means.\n\n5) The brawling. It's stupid easy to do, so you can make some pretty decent cash off of it.\n\n6) I love the music. It fits a fantasy setting perfectly.\n\n7) The graphics in the Enhanced Edition are lovely and colorful, especially on the high graphics setting (Although it does seem to have a lot of stuttering and optimization issues).\n\n8) The gloomy, rainy weather.\n\nWhat I didn't like about the game:1) The dialogue is very dragging and leaves something to be desired. I'm all for story and role-playing, and I know this game was a book first, but there is a lot of talking, and much of the game's length is padded by it. What the characters sometimes say is very pretentious at times, and at other times, it tries too hard to be “edgy” by making everyone cuss all the time. I have nothing against swearing-- I swear like a sailor in real life-- but I don't do it half as much as this game did. You know that one kid in school who just learned to swear and thinks it’s the greatest thing ever? Yeah. That’s this game’s dialogue. And target audience.\n\n2) Female characters almost always have one of two purposes, or at times, both: to be rescued, or to be boned. No matter who the woman is, she will throw herself on Geralt (or whom I love to call "Greyalt") at the opportunity to screw him. I once talked to some elf girl who said she could teach me her language. “Cool!” I thought. “I want to learn elf language! That might come in handy for my character!” Next thing I know, her half-naked trading card flashes me out of nowhere and we’re screwing each other (or gelling together in the background, at least). What the hell? I wanted to learn elvish! I didn’t want to screw her! Then she wandered off and I never saw her again. Great. Pointless. Thank you for wasting my time. Many encounters I had with women were purely accidental out of my desire for completing all of the quests in the game.\n\nDespite this complaint, it is really good for a laugh seeing just how hard they were trying to up the sexiness of the game. People say the weirdest sexual things at really odd, inopportune moments, and it’s over-the-top, cheesy as all get out and hilarious. For example: "I can conjure up ♥♥♥♥♥♥s". Who says that, even if you are a sorceress?\n\n3) The combat. Yeah, you knew this was coming. This is the most common complaint about The Witcher, and it is 100% justified. It's extremely boring. Click. Wait for the cursor to turn orange. Click. Wait for it to turn orange again. Click. Again. Again. Again. It’s not that it’s hard, or complicated. It’s tedious and puts me to sleep. I have yet to try out Witcher 2, and I pray the combat is nothing like this one. One of the more tedious things about it is switching weapons for different enemies and situations, and how long it takes for him to pull out the next weapon. The game has to register that you made the change, so while you're waiting for Greyalt to pull out his other sword, you're standing there getting pummeled.\n\n4) There are no faster means of travel, and the maps are huge. This isn’t too big of a complaint, because I love massive environments. However, I still would have liked a mount of some kind to make it a little quicker.\n\n5) The quest tracking is a great feature, but sometimes it’s just plain wrong. It’ll tell you where a character might be rather than where they currently are.\n\n6) Those sub-weapons. They’re useless. Except the torch. I love the torch.\n\n7) The Signs aren’t good enough for me. Never used them, and I still completed the game just fine without them.\n\n8) Fetch quests. I eventually avoided taking contracts. I made money punching people instead. This didn't change the game's plot at all.\n\n9) Greyalt is a lousy protagonist. He’s a sarcastic ♥♥♥♥♥♥ that is always looking to start fights. I get that he’s supposed to be a “tough guy” or whatever, but he doesn’t seem to like or get along with anyone unless they open their legs for him. He talks in this really annoying Batman voice and never smiles. He's too busy brooding about which woman to be with.\n\n10) This contains semi-spoilers: Alvin (who I call "The Chipmunk"). There was no point to his existence other than to hook you up with one of two women and to pad the game with even more dialogue. You waste so much time playing around with this little runt, and nothing (interesting) ever comes of it. When the game came to its conclusion, I hadn't seen him for two chapters, and he never showed up again. It's possible that your connection with him is based on the path you chose... but should that really matter?\n\n11) Greyalt’s “amnesia” is conveniently gone when the plot calls for it.\n\n12) Drowners.\n\nBiggest Disappointment:This conclusion contains spoilers\n\nI have two: the romance elements, and Rayla.\n\nSimply put, Rayla was the only female character in the game I actually liked. However, she is never a romance option for you. Well, you can bone her once. But that doesn’t mean a thing. Because she dies immediately after. Twice. First by what’s-his-elfin’-name, and again by you, and you have no choice in this matter. The game saddles you with two possible perma-romance options: Shani (who I call "Yawni") and Triss ("Twits"). I didn’t like Yawni or Twits very much, but because I wanted to give Alvin a place to stay, I figured “here, Yawni, you take him. He’d be better off with you than Twits, who I swear is a psycho in disguise.” Yawni immediately attaches herself to you, even if you don’t want it, and begins to tell you she loves you and pretty much asks you straight up to marry her and have a little family with her. Um, holy crap? I didn’t want this. It seemed like the game refused to move forward unless you settled down with one of them. Well, I didn't like either of them. I called Yawni my "friend" and went about my business. Take that, game.","September 20, 2015","false","40.9"," 159 of 298 people (53%) found this review helpful 40 people found this review funny","53","159","298","40","45"

As you expect the The Witcher is based on a series of book written by the polish author Andrzej Sapkowski, so from the beginning the game already has a really large and well established lore to start with. The game puts you into the boots of Geralt of Rivia, a witcher that is trained since he was very young to become a badass monster slayer, but he is not doing it for free, you need to throw a couple of gold if you want your local atrocity to be dealt with. In terms of gameplay the game can be a little clunky but it's rewarding as well. Geralt is able to equip one of his two swords, more precisely the steel sword and the silver sword. The steel one is used for killing humans and the other one is for monsters. I still can't see how the silver one is not that effective against humans but I let that pass. Geralt will be able to explore a vast open world with interesting characters and I will warn you, that there is a lot of dark comedic tone in pretty much all the dialogue but somehow it manages to give The Witcher the personality it strived for. The UI is gonna be very strange at first but will get used to it and it will never break imersion when you shuffle through your inventory for potions and recipes. The music and sound is pretty good and matches the medieval fantasy air that the game brings, but the voice acting is kinda less to be desired. On the bad note The Witcher suffers from the disease called "♥♥♥♥yourquesttracking"-ilia. Is really easy to get all your quests managed when you can't find where the hell are you supposed to go or how many of "x" monster you have to kill to get "y" item so you can fetch it back to "z" NPC. Despite all those flaws The Witcher has been a really fun experience and I would recommend it only to people that enjoy a dark and mature story.\n\nP.S. I don't like to give any games that I review any grades or marks or any other kind of number so I'll say that if you find yourself atracted to game you should try it first hand, before judging it from some popular reviewer POV.\n\nGame On!","February 12","true","48.0"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

To start, I'm going to say that you should buy this game when it goes on sale for 85% for $1.49 (which it does often). For the price that you pay, you get well worth the cost back with fun.\n\nThe Witcher 1 has a nice compelling story with a good conclusion. You play as a Witcher called Geralt who lost his memory and try to track down Salamandra. There are a phlethora of both main story quests and side quests and the intermingling of those actually make the quest line very fun. It also makes the side quests (grinding ones sometimes) much less boring and some can get done while you do the main quest. As for the main story quest, you can alter it depending on who you side with at times. There will be quite a few times where you have to side with people or make key decisions. Although they don't ruin the story if you chose the "other" side, they do change some of the narrative in the future.\n\nSo onto some of the cons that make me want to rage sometimes. First of all, there is no jump option. This isn't a big deal or anything since the space bar is just atactical pause, but there are quite a few hidden walls where there clearly shouldnt be or could not be. You litearlly cannot jump off any kind of ledge at all, no matter how small. Furthermore, the combat is a bit clunky in many regards and like with the invisible walls, enemies have their own "invisible wall" region that acts like a block. My last critique of this game is their character models. They recycle the same character models for a lot of side characters and some quests characters way too much. The same old man, fat rich man, drunkard, etc keeps appearing over and over. The voice actor is even the same for those most of the time. However, the essential characters are unique and have their own unique voice actors.\n\nOverall, the Witcher 1 is a bit clunky, but is well worth the play, especially for the price of $1.49. If you want to play down the series to Witcher 3, it can only get better and therefore by starting with Witcher 1, you derive the maximum possible utility for playing the whole series.\n\nRating: 8.0/10","December 25, 2015","true","43.5"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","100","5","5","3","0"

It uses the Aurora engine, Neverwinter Nights good old engine.  What they did with the engine is kind of magic if you compare how fugly NWN is (The Engine do have its own charm although) The big fuss people have is the combat but  I find one get used to it. Nor is it just QTE, magic, potions and positioning is of importance.\n\nThe models are not the greatest and reused but the characters are not bad, the story is not bad. It is a great build up to Witcher 2 and even if some quests are "gather 10 wolf balls and bring them to me" but it kinda fit the team of being the monster hunting Witcher. And the drop rate is usually 100% so you do not have to kill 40 wolves to get 10 wolf balls. So I can live with it. I believe I almost finished all the quest and I did complain a lot. But it is more of a "Damn I want to play Witcher 2". Since I did finish the game and explored all corners of the map and gathered my wolf pelts, basilisk scales and drowner brains everywhere.\n\nIf one like RPGs with a bit of a darker tone to it  (You can simply not please every side) and can stand the combat  it is worth it. The game is a good bridge into Witcher 2 and the world is big. Many  areas are super cozy and even with this engine they manage to pull them off as appealing and vibrant. Lot of NPC just going by their day. ♥♥♥♥ the swamps although, that is a big area but in the end you get used to it. It is not the strongest game made, it got flaws but it is also a charming, strong game that can stand on its own. A first game from a small Polish studio, so it is hard to be overly judgemental on it.","January 1, 2015","true","43.4"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/LATABOM/recommended/20900/","LATABOM","LandoCalrisian","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LATABOM/","838 products in account","The fact that this is one of the better cRPGs released in the last 10 years mainly speaks to the fact that there are very few good cRPGs. The graphics are nice, and there's lots to do, but almost everything is either very uneven or downright poor.\n\nCombat, after you get used to the "rhythm game" style is very repetitive, and by mid-game poses absolutely zero challenge since certain powers are so stupidly overpowered. Enemies give diminishing XP, so there's thankfully no real reason to fight most of them since little fun is provided. Since you never really have a party to work with, all strategy is eliminated, which I think is why they added the rhythm element to try and add some sort of depth. They failed. After the first act of trying things out, combat is never really engaging or fun. Fire spells are so stupidly overpowered that by midgame, it's basically a "win" button on medium difficulty.\n\nThe story of the game is also super uneven. Feels like a handful of good ideas that were screwed up by people completely inexperienced in writing a screenplay. Dialogue is uneven and not helped by mostly below average voice acting, and lots of plot threads just kind of lurch back and forth with bad pacing. The "big twist" in the game doesn't happen until the Epilogue and is both crappy and comes too late. I honestly didn't care about the character involved and the reasoning behind it made zero logical sense. The makers have obviously tried to make choice a "shades of gray" kind of thing with both sides you can choose between basically being ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and unlikeable. The humans are racists who are killing and stealing from the elves and dwarves and putting them in ghettos, while the elves and dwarves retaliate by murdering civilian families.... and you have to pick a side that ultimately will have very little effect on the grand scheme of things. Every time you do something that seems obviously humane, they have to stick something in there to make sure there really was no "good guy" option.\n\nCertain characters that I assume come from the source books show up and play key roles. They get little to no backstory (since you already know them!), so unless you've read the books (i didn't), you will have little attachment to them even though the game treats them like they're your dear old friends. Not helped by really bored voice actors. The other characters don't get much backstory, so you won't get attached to any of them either. Dialogue is really uneven, and characters' motivations, including the main character, are all in all very poorly handled and it really seems amateurish.\n\nThe makers shoehorned lots of sex into the game, so basically if you don't explicity tell every female character that you don't want to have sex with them, you'll be shown a still picture of them naked. Most of the time, the naked still drawing doesn't look like their in-game model. I guess that's supposed to give the game a "mature" theme, but I just found it to be weird.\n\nThere's an ok quantity of loot in the form of craftable potions and buffs, but you'll probably upgrade your weapons 2-4 times and armor twice in the course of the game. Potions really aren't necessary on normal difficulty. Inventory management is just a pain in the ♥♥♥. You have space to hold about 94% of the game's different crafting materials a ta time. Why not 100%, really? Bad design. There's one item in the game you'll have to save up money for, and once you've done that, take my advice and don't bother hoarding food or treasure items. No point, really.\n\nQuest structure is the most frustrating part of this game. There's not really any fast travel. Each act takes place over 3-4 relatively small "zones". Most quests involve "go 2 zones over, get something, and then come back here before going back 2 zones over and coming back again". Most questgivers start indoors, so going 2 zones over generally means 3-4 loading screens each way plus some walking. There isn't much to do besides the main quest and a small number of side quests, so doing a few quests at the same time and multitasking your trips to different zones really isn't an option.\n\nIt took me 40 hours to play through the game, but I felt like if there was a decent fast travel system, even one that just let you teleport to the start of each zone after you've visited each once, the game probably only would have taken 25-40 hours. Literally 25-35% of game time felt like meaningless jogging between quest markers and load screens.\n\nI should also say that if you hated Dragon Age 2's running around in the city, that you spend over half of this game in one city, which is much much smaller and has much much less to do than Kirkwall did.\n\nThe game looks nice and the setting is generally good (the glaring excepting being when they shoehorn the lady of the lake/holy grail/excalibur legend into the game which really smashes immersion), and the music is quite strong.\n\nIn all, I'd still actually recommend this game IF AND ONLY IF you haven't already played:\n\nDragon Age 1 + 2\nBaldur's Gate 1 + 2\nIcewind Dale 1 + 2\nElder Scrolls 3 + 4 + 5\nThe Divinity Series\nNeverwinter Nights 2 + Modules\nArcanum\n(maybe Neverwinter Nights 1 + expansions as well)\n\nThey are all better cRPGs that are in fantasy settings, and are basically better in all gameplay and story aspects other than graphics.\n\nI'm going to play Witcher 2 next, which might end up making me appreciate Witcher 1 more (or not.)","October 15, 2014","true","44.4"," 11 of 17 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","11","17","0","0"

You can't block or parry or dodge attacks by will, it is all determined by chance, which increases as you level up the correct skills. It is a 3rd person click mini game to put it short, you draw your sword and click on an enemy to execute techniques to damage your foes. It was good  that you couldn't spam click, you had to wait and click at the right time to execute a move correctly, otherwise it will fail. One thing i admire about the combat mechanics is the fact that you have 3 different stances, one is slow but does a lot of damage, one is for swift enemies, and the other stance is used when you fight against more than 1 enemy, i loved that idea. But AGAIN, its broken, at some point i was surrounded by 10 enemies and switched to group stance, my attacks never registered for some reason and i always ended up just casting Area of effect spells.\n\nYou had the ability to cast spells in this game, which were very useful. You could cast a certain amount of spells based on your "endurance" levels. Finally a game that excludes the word mana. The spells were extremely hard to land sometimes as it is always casted in front of you.\n\nThe enemy AI of the game is completely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Sometimes they would just take it up the ♥♥♥ while you hit them with your sword, you could run in circles of tables and stuff and they will blindy follow you. When they have your back turned to you and are unaware to your presence, they would suddenly turn around when you get close enough and start attacking you. So there wasn't really advanced intelligence of enemies in this game, its very basic.\n\nOne thing i liked a lot of the game is the variety of enemies you could face. Each enemy had its weakness for example, certain enemies are immune to fire, some enemies require you to fight them in different stances, some enemies are weak to silver more than steel etc. The game required you to purchase/find books containing information about the various monsters found in the witcher world, as this information is not known from the very start. I liked this concept, it made me feel like a true monster hunter doing research and planning ahead before facing an enemy.\n\nAnother thing i really liked about the game is the Alchemy. You could find various recipes of potions that could aid you in a fight. Recipes could be bought or found randomly in the world. Ingredients could be found via plants, organs of slain monsters and potion bases which are found in alchemy shops. It was interesting to see that when you drink a potion a little animation would pop out, quite nice I liked this concept a lot. Certain potions gave you permanent benefits, which could only be crafted if a boss was slain and its rare ingredient obtained, this was very encouraging for me to hunt down and kill bosses.\n\nOne very interesting thing about the game is that you could earn experience, and gain levels and attribute points which you could distirbute in one big skill tree. Skills that could be leveled up include the 3 different fighting stances for steel as well as silver weapons, Intensity of the spells you cast and their effectiveness, the amount of health you regenerate and have at once, and also your resistances to stuns and blindness and heaps of other degrading effects.\n\nIN the game you could also find weapons and armor, but the variety in them is extremely dissapointing. I only got a new sword when i have played 75% of the game, you could buy other swords and pick up weapons from enemies but they always carry the same stuff, no 'rare' loot in the game really. Some shops had better armor and weapons but they were so expensive to buy, there is no way you could make enough money in the game to afford it, unless you spend 10 hours slaying monsters and selling their organs. You could only use swords in the game, daggers and axes were very inneffective to use as it "couldn't be used with witcher combat moves"\n\nThe plot of the game was quite enjoyable, it was my main motivation to finish this game and move on to the sequel. Characters in the game were unique, but there was no real bonding towards characters, i couldn't care less if someone i knew died in the game. The game didnt have a lot of variety in characters, there where a lot of similar looking NPC's with the same face as well as the same voice. In the game you also had to make decisions that would impact you at the end of the game, this I really enjoyed, you had the free will to choose sides or stay neutural. Pick friends and foes alike, and there were a lot of combinations of different choices you could pick as well.\n\nThe game is quite violent, there are swear words in there, lots of adult themes and of course, lots of sex and nudity as well as a bit of gambling. I found the gambling to be quite entertaining. It was called "poker dice" where each player started with 6 dice each and would roll them to get pairs, three of a kind and a full house etc. Bids are placed at the start, after the first roll and it consistet of best out of 3. Though the gambling wasn't very big in the game, you would encounter someone to play with every now and again, but not always.\n\nMap design was quite well done, but it was annoying to navigate around landscapes, as the character you were playing as could not vault over a tiny little fence. YOu would always have a map of the area you were playing in and quests would give you map markers, but not always. I found the waypoints to be a bit faulty at times as it led me to places where my objectives weren't even close to.\n\nAll and all, the game was at certain points very frustrating for me to play, as the combat mechanics faultyness caused me to die numerous times. I played the game from the hardest difficulty, I highly reccomend you play this game on the easiest difficulty otherwise you might smash your computer screen if you have a bad temper. One of my friends recommended me this game, and now i will recommend it to you, as this game has turned into a franchise and its sequel is much much better.\n\nSUMMARY:\nTHE GOOD:\n-Interesting variety of enemies that required preperation for them to be faced.\n-Complex Alchemy that was always useful in a fight.\n-Interesting story, which is the biggest thing that kept me playing.\n-Had the free will to pick your friends and enemies, the game has alternative endings.\n-Good skill tree development that had to be chosen carefully\n-Fun gambling\n-Porn\n\nTHE BAD:\n-Absolutely terrible combat mechanics that make you want to smash your screen\n-Identical npc's everywhere\n-not a lot of loot variety\n-Combat is repetitive 'click, click, click, click"\n-Annoying companions at some point.\n-Quest system a bit faulty, quest markers would sometimes lead you to the wrong places.\n\nOVERALL I give this game a solid 7/10.","February 17, 2014","true","30.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","2"

When i saw the trailer for The Witcher 3 i was blown away and straight away thought this is going to be right up my street (RPG fan), so i bought 1 & 2.\n\nFrom the start of Witcher the story is a little hazy and for some reason it doesn't grab you right away.  A bit of advise:  Stick with it!  After about 3 hours in the story begins to unfold and the gameplay really picks up.  As you play more and more the more additive is becomes.  The story is just brilliant and really draws you in.  I was really surprised how i was so into it and how i just wanted to play more and more to unfold more of the story and path i had chosen.  The path you choose is up to you, choose wisely on what you do and who you go with, it all matters in the end.\n\nIf you are looking for a good RPG, then this a great game to play and you won't be disappointed.

You could find various recipes of potions that could aid you in a fight. Recipes could be bought or found randomly in the world. Ingredients could be found via plants, organs of slain monsters and potion bases which are found in alchemy shops. It was interesting to see that when you drink a potion a little animation would pop out, quite nice I liked this concept a lot. Certain potions gave you permanent benefits, which could only be crafted if a boss was slain and its rare ingredient obtained, this was very encouraging for me to hunt down and kill bosses.\n\nOne very interesting thing about the game is that you could earn experience, and gain levels and attribute points which you could distirbute in one big skill tree. Skills that could be leveled up include the 3 different fighting stances for steel as well as silver weapons, Intensity of the spells you cast and their effectiveness, the amount of health you regenerate and have at once, and also your resistances to stuns and blindness and heaps of other degrading effects.\n\nIN the game you could also find weapons and armor, but the variety in them is extremely dissapointing. I only got a new sword when i have played 75% of the game, you could buy other swords and pick up weapons from enemies but they always carry the same stuff, no 'rare' loot in the game really. Some shops had better armor and weapons but they were so expensive to buy, there is no way you could make enough money in the game to afford it, unless you spend 10 hours slaying monsters and selling their organs. You could only use swords in the game, daggers and axes were very inneffective to use as it "couldn't be used with witcher combat moves"\n\nThe plot of the game was quite enjoyable, it was my main motivation to finish this game and move on to the sequel. Characters in the game were unique, but there was no real bonding towards characters, i couldn't care less if someone i knew died in the game. The game didnt have a lot of variety in characters, there where a lot of similar looking NPC's with the same face as well as the same voice. In the game you also had to make decisions that would impact you at the end of the game, this I really enjoyed, you had the free will to choose sides or stay neutural. Pick friends and foes alike, and there were a lot of combinations of different choices you could pick as well.\n\nThe game is quite violent, there are swear words in there, lots of adult themes and of course, lots of sex and nudity as well as a bit of gambling. I found the gambling to be quite entertaining. It was called "poker dice" where each player started with 6 dice each and would roll them to get pairs, three of a kind and a full house etc. Bids are placed at the start, after the first roll and it consistet of best out of 3. Though the gambling wasn't very big in the game, you would encounter someone to play with every now and again, but not always.\n\nMap design was quite well done, but it was annoying to navigate around landscapes, as the character you were playing as could not vault over a tiny little fence. YOu would always have a map of the area you were playing in and quests would give you map markers, but not always. I found the waypoints to be a bit faulty at times as it led me to places where my objectives weren't even close to.\n\nAll and all, the game was at certain points very frustrating for me to play, as the combat mechanics faultyness caused me to die numerous times. I played the game from the hardest difficulty, I highly reccomend you play this game on the easiest difficulty otherwise you might smash your computer screen if you have a bad temper. One of my friends recommended me this game, and now i will recommend it to you, as this game has turned into a franchise and its sequel is much much better.\n\nSUMMARY:\nTHE GOOD:\n-Interesting variety of enemies that required preperation for them to be faced.\n-Complex Alchemy that was always useful in a fight.\n-Interesting story, which is the biggest thing that kept me playing.\n-Had the free will to pick your friends and enemies, the game has alternative endings.\n-Good skill tree development that had to be chosen carefully\n-Fun gambling\n-Porn\n\nTHE BAD:\n-Absolutely terrible combat mechanics that make you want to smash your screen\n-Identical npc's everywhere\n-not a lot of loot variety\n-Combat is repetitive 'click, click, click, click"\n-Annoying companions at some point.\n-Quest system a bit faulty, quest markers would sometimes lead you to the wrong places.\n\nOVERALL I give this game a solid 7/10.","February 17, 2014","true","30.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","2"

If you are dedicated enough to pick up the game these days, you'll want a few things:\n\nFull Combat Rebalance Mod (glitchy, but not moreoso than the original game).\nThe witcher wikia for when you get stuck. Because you will, on a stupid and poorly worded quest.\nA very large amount of free time.\nAn obsessive love of consumables.\nAn insane amount of patience. I almost broke my keyboard a couple times.\nUnlike modern games, the movement and comb at systems are very unforgiving and do not hold your hand. You'll want to spend some decent time "grinding", or killing creatures over and over until you are comfortable with the gameplay. On harder difficulties, there's really no way to handle many scenarios unless you have thoroughl explored and completed each and every quest, and on that note been lucky enough to not have locked away rewards behind a poor choice or questline started too early.\n\nYou'll also need to rely heavily on consumables and an inventory strategy at all times - management and planning because a mini-game all in itself which could be a turn off for some players and a joy for others. All in all, the Witcher 1 still retains its shine and stands out boldy from the other games of its time period - this is the game where CDPR showed Bioware how to use its own engine fully, and did it better.\n\n2007 ReviewWhile other RPG's are in a race downhill to appeal to the lowest common denominator, the Witcher proudly shouts a few obscenities and then descends into a tub of bloodbaths. The dialogue may leave a little to be desired, it can be forgiven thanks to the vast and powerful storyline with twists and turns worthy of any 5 star RPG. Also, that its translated from Polish, so there's that.\n\nThe mythology of the Witcher world itself is heavily rooted in Scandinavian and specifically Polish culture and it really shines through. Brutal and murderous takes on every fantasy tropes are there in there ancient yet recognizable form, lurking, waiting to be turned into alchemical componds and pricey trophies.\n\nThe combat is frustating at points to be sure, but it can be compensated for by reading up on monsters in your codex. The game heavily relies on you exploring and learning every last detail, not to mention taking advantage of its fully fleshed out alchemy system coupled with a medium to small inventory for the amount of items in the world.\n\nHonestly, even with its faults, the Witcher is my 2007 game of the year. Sorry BioShock and Crysis, you'll need to fight over second place.","October 29, 2015","true","54.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

And once you start getting combo's into the 3's to 5's it's quite fun to watch Geralt do elaborate multiple swings and backflips.\n\n-Not fond of the easy, trashy women, every woman I come across in the game wants Geralt. None of them seem to have any morals or respect for themselves. And don't have old fashion values of courting, romance or being wooed properly.\n\n-Monster hunting side quests a bit boring and repetitive.\n-some quests have a lot of back tracking with no quick way to travel.\n-inventory is so small with no way to expand it.\n-unimportant NPC's have many replica's such as old peasant women all look the same, the merchants all are fat richly robed etc.\n-A bit too linear, can't go back to previous areas.\n-A bit disapointed at the end to obviously what Alvin has become in the future.\n-even playing on normal mode, didn't need alchemy much, mostly just used swallow, Cat, white rafford's Decoction and the occasional oil coating. Didn't bother with bombs.\n-With the signs only used Aard for knockback and Igni for Incineration, didn't find the others that useful or necessary.\n\nDespite the things I didn't like, I definitely reccomend this game, especially for those who like RPG's and a good story.

At first I tought I shouldn´t, but I´m glad I did play it. At first it seemed really strange, specially the combat, but I got used to it. It feels like an older game, as it should, but it was very enjoyable and gave me a lot of background on the witcher story. Characters are good, voice acting is Ok and it was a much better experience than I was expecting. Graphics are good for the time, but of course the characters seem a bit "dolly", although the environment looks really good. Sometimes quests feel a bit like a chore... go there, come back, go there again, come back again, etc.... games nowadays have less of these "tricks" to make it longer, since they´re huge anyway.  The story is good and I´m glad I did play it! So if you like the witcher and was wondering if you should play this.... go for it. Give it a shot!

The combat is initially a confusing and unrepsonsive mess. You cant use a controller with this game and so the combat consists of you choosing the necessary sword (steel or silver) and a combat style best suited to the situation (strong, fast or group) and quite literally having to time mouse clicks via on screen prompts.\n\nYeah, it's an odd choice.\n\nThis being said at around hour 4 I had the hang of it and actually came to love and respect it's uniqueness in it's own way.\n\nIf you can get passed this early on, along with the relatively old animations, occasional hiccup in writing and lack of multiple chracter models (seriously, there cant be anymore than about 20 in this 35+ hour game) then you will be enthralled by the music, the deep and interesting lore, the humor and the cast of fun and enticing characters.\n\nIn the end I would say I possibly enjoyesd this more than I did The Elder Scrolls V:  Skyrim.\nI know, that's a bold statement. But I think Skyrim delivered everything I expected and nothing more. The Witcher exceeded my expectations immensely. Don't do what I did and pass on this game because you think it's too old or outdated.\n\nPlay it, love it.\n\nP.S. - You can have sex with a HUGE amount of the women in the game, and each time you do you collect an old school "Nudey" trading card.\n\nJust because.\n\nOn one occasion, I beat up a young girl's father because he wouldnt let me see his daughter to fetch a friend's lute back, convinced I was going to shag her because that's what my friend did. I then proceeded to shag her brains out. She loved it.\n\n\n10/10 would throw done with daddy again...","October 13, 2015","true","38.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

It has all the Witcher lore and characters that any fan would love. The gameplay and the user interface aren't brilliant, so be prepared to deal with that. Apart from that everything else is great. It has that sort of hardcore old school RPG feel to it where the game gives you minimal guidance and leaves you to do most of the thinking to very, nowadays, extreme levels. I wouldn't recommend it as an introduction to the Witcher universe unless you're into that hardcore old school style of RPGs. I would recommend, instead, either reading one or more of the books or playing the second game.

The tutorial was just so slow and cliché that I lost interest each time.  But, seeing the good reviews of The Witcher 3, I figured I had better go back and play 1 and 2.\n\nSo, I finally played through the whole game and finished almost every quest.  It's a solid RPG once you get past the tutorial/intro.  A bit dated graphically by today's standards, but you get used to it and it's really not bad since everything is voiced and the voice acting is pretty good.  There are a few good plot twists and solid, immersive worlds.  Nice integration of ambiguous ethical choices and "adult situations", although at times both can seem a bit forced.  Still, a worthwhile experience and a good story.\n\nThe combat is OK, decent considering how old the game is and the engine that they were using.  Combat is way more fun if you level up a few magic skills so that you can do some magic combos.  Particularly, the powerful fire magic combined with "group" sword styles is really fun.\n\nThe menus and quest tracking work pretty well too.  Not perfect, but overall very good.  There are a few mods out there which rework the interface if you're looking for something a bit more modern without all the graphic flair.\n\nI definitely recommend getting a movement-speed mod for this game, which can easily be found on the Nexus site.  Otherwise you will spend a LOT of extra time just jogging from place to place with not much happening in between except a few monster battles.

A Witcher is a monster slayer... a person who sets out to purge the evil of the land. Their training as children make the efficent, powerful, and fearsome characters. They are able to use magic, heal at a rapid rate and during the process they become sterile.\n\nThis game is full of adventure, sex, action, and a compelling story. Although the voice acting could be a bit better it's quite amazing and on the level of Skyrim. You have choices that ultimately change your story. The world is a linear in a way, but open. It has different areas you can go into, with in those towns, villages, and cities you visit you can freely explore them until you move toward the next area.\n\nFor this review i give this a 10/10 It's an absolutely gorgeous fantasy style rpg game that is not only fun, story driven and interesting, there is tons of side quests and challenges that just make it more fun. They have people talking that make it more fun and it's defintely a must have for any gamer.","August 16, 2014","true","41.6"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","1"

It feels great! Few games have ever achieved this level of detail.\n\nEverything you do has an outcome, so not only this game has a high rate of re-playability, it will suprise you on your second run how things go different.\n\nAlso if you are a big pervert like me, you also will enjoy the sexual theme going in this game(infact in the book Geralt, the main hero, bangs anything that moves and is female apparently).\n\nWell written story/ies, very original and distinct from what we are used to, the only downside is the combat system, but I got used to it.\n\nOne of the best RPGs out there indeed!

It was made using the Aurora Toolkit, a module editor from one of my favorite games, Neverwinter Nights, the first game I ever bought, and the only one for many years.\n\nThe best thing about Neverwinter Nights was, of course, the editor, nay, the great community of players who made such amazing content. It was released in 2002 and people are still playing it, still making new content, much because Neverwinter Nights 2 was so disappointing. I played some incredible modules, some of them in multiplayer, using the DM client, which allowed playing like it was a paper and pen RPG, really. Why they never released another game with this feature?\n\nBut enough about Neverwinter Nights, let’s talk about The Witcher. It is everything I expected, and more. I could cope with the limitations of the engine, and the story really surprised me for its deep. Many themes were dealt in this game: politics, sex, alchemy, magic, destiny, the holy grail, mutants… I had no previous knowledge of the Witcher universe, but I fell in love with it. It’s like Game Of Thrones meets Conan meets Van Helsing. Geralt is smart and charming. The game makes you feel like your choices matter, even makes you feel guilt about them later. Except for the way you treat women, and that is a shame.\n\nThe political issue caught my attention: The Order of The Flaming Rose represents a fanatical religious and military organization that hates non-humans (that represents native peoples). The non-humans fight for freedom and equal rights. The druids represent environmentalists, helping non-humans when they can. Those in power only want to keep their power. The witchers represent a small, powerful group of people who prefer to stay neutral, but end up being used by both sides of the conflict.\n\nThe ending is great, but it could be even better if the things you said to Alvin actually affected the end result, assuming Jacques is really Alvin from the future.\n\nSo, in quick list:\n+ Great story\n+ Interesting setting\n+ Well written dialogues\n+ Balanced quests, including some puzzles\n+ Nice character system (considering the limitations of the engine)\n+ Includes an Adventure Editor\n- Some glitches and other engine limitations\n- Combat sometimes gets boring with so many spawning monsters\n- There are some holes in the narrative\n","January 2, 2015","true","100.2"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Although not being able to easily warp from one location to another is a little bit annoying, I never found it to be a major issue, and I wholeheartedly disagree with the Witcher's combat being poor; it's simple, yes, and generally pretty easy, but increasing the difficulty or brewing a few of the many potions in the game can help to spice things up.\n\nThe reason I adore this game, however, is less due to the gameplay (which I have no trouble with) but more to do with Andrzej Sapkowski's fantastic characters and world, coupled with CD PROJEKT's great writing and incredible musical score. My only complaint with the Witcher is the fact that Geralt, who gets more action than most of the game's courtesans, looks frighteningly like a lizard.","May 19","true","71.7"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","83","5","6","3","0"

In fact I've played it 6 years ago when I didn't have the game on steam so it's time to write my view on the game.\n\nGREAT GAME. If you like story driven RPGs you won't go wrong here. The atmosphere of the whole world is pictured really well. Gloomy and corrupted world full of complex characters. It's up to player to figure out true character of persons and make decisions with them. Combat may not be for everyone but I like the way how they made it. You simply click on the enemy and at the end of attack you click again to join another attack. It isn't really hard but some timing is required. You have 3 different styles (strong, fast, group) which you can change according to situation. Also you have some kind of magic (signs) which makes a combat more interesting and some alchemy. Everything is upgraded through a talent tree with higher levels.\n\nThe plot is interesting and your decisions actually matters. Graphic is pretty good for a 7 years old game. You can make it even better with some mods.\nI finished the game twice now and maybe I will play it again in the future. It took me over 50 hours to finish the game on hard difficulty with every sidequest I could find.\n\nSo I can only recommend this game for everyone who likes RPGs with STRONG STORY, nice graphics, interesting combat and other things which good RPG should have.","August 12, 2014","true","58.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The Witcher is a dark and rather mature game. You get to make game-changing decisions that let you feel as though you are a part of the game.\n\nThe first chapter is rather slow, but it gives you time to experiment around and get a feel for the combat. Some of the game mechanics were not explained properly (such as the alchemy) and it took a bit of experimenting to get some things to work. The combat is not truly combat. You click when an icon appears and let your character do the rest. That, coupled with the fact that signs were too overpowered, led to a dull gameplay experience. However, all that are minor annoyances compared to what the game is truly capable of. The developers don't hold your hand and lead you through the entire game. Instead, they give you a few basic tutorials and leave the rest to experimentation. It also helps that alchemy is not a must (unless you're on higher difficulties).\n\nAll in all, the games treats you like an adult, leaving you with choices that feel real. You must choose between several choices based on your moral code, since nothing in this game is truly black and white. You would be hard pressed to decide sometimes and what you choose really just comes down to what you feel is right. The graphics are'nt amazing, and there are quite a few technical issues, but overall, I feel that this game is worth playing.","February 8, 2014","true","4.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

On the one hand, the game is great, it has amazing dialogues, storyline, quests, lore, characters, etc. - it is obvious that PC Project did a great job. However, I highly advise to read the actual novel prior to playing this game, or many things might be totally unclear to you (the entire story of 7 books is very long though, and it is understandable that not many people have enough time to do it) or at least, try to find the Polish movie of 2000 (which is a crap though).\n\nUnfortunately, the Witcher series are not that popular as Game of Thrones in North America, which becomes a problem because majority of people know nothing of this Universe and what had happened in the world prior to this game - and there were lots of things happening. I ll try to summarize everything in one sentence - a war had happened which united the Northern Kingdoms against an army of Southerners, the war was won - at the same time, there is a huge Elven rebellion happening, and of course, Witchers, the mystique organization which had sworn to protect humans from evil, is slowly disapepearing from the public. Geralt is among the last ones to survive.\n\nOf course, devs did a good job explain everything from the start, but still the game has enormous amount of flashbacks which test your knowledge of the series, and in order to enjoy the game in full extent it is advisable to know what the heck is going on at least.\n\nOn the other hand, there is some element of uncertainty. A. Sapkowski, the original author of the series, made it clear several years ago that the story of Witcher did not end in his books yet, and if I understand it correctly - he is working on another book currently. In this way, I am just very confused whether how this game as well as Witcher 2 and 3, would fit into Universe. But this is a question which cannot be answered yet. For now, I give a strong A + to the game.\n\n9 / 10","October 27, 2015","true","277.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

My opinion doesn't differ alot from most of the positive reviews: The Witcher 1 is a game with a well-designed story which is based on the witcher-novels of Andrzej Sapkowski,  astounishing graphics (at least back in it's release-days in 2008), complexe quests and tough/impactful decisions as well as memorable characters...\n\nYet it also suffers from certain problems, mainly considering the fighting system and (from todays perspective) some lesser gameplay issues as well as "bad" graphics and a very deep lore which needs quite some time to be fully understood. This may scare you off if you're not 100% determined to finish this game.\n\nIn my opinion one should watch some gameplay videos or read the first novel before considering to play this game. This will make it easier to understand the lore and might also give you some determination to play it.

It's 2016 as I write this, and I refuse to play The Witcher 3 until I beat the previous two, and we all know that I have to play The Witcher 3... I HAVE TO! I am now 50-something hours into this beast and I'm not gonna lie to you, it is a ♥♥♥♥ing grind sometimes. Collect ten of these, bring this to there, grind money, farm herbs... It reminds me of some of the worst parts of WoW at its low points. There's also The Witcher's graphics, which, in its day, probably would have melted my face off like the ark of the covenant, but now they're pretty rough. The gameplay is equally dated and suffers from some truely bizarre implementation choices (Parapa the Rappa style combat?). It takes grit to get through it sometimes.\n\nBut despite all of that, there is a seed of greatness taking root here. Even by modern standards, the original Witcher has an incredible depth to its mechanics (flawed as they are), and a richness of character and storytelling that is woefully lacking in most games (even modern RPGs). There's no black and white moral scale here to define your actions. No need to max out your good or evil points to get this or that ability. Just choices. You make choices and you live with the consequences. That's the price of admission. Sometimes you'll make a choice, and twenty hours later that ♥♥♥♥ will come back to bite you in the ♥♥♥, and it's not because you made the wrong choice, but because there wasn't a right choice. This game's not about finding the optimal path of least resistance. It's about moral ambiguity, and the story of an active participant in history, ♥♥♥♥-ups and all. This game made me step away from my keyboard a few times to think it over before I made my choices. I agonized over them sometimes, but in the end, no matter the outcome, it always felt right.\n\nI will say this however: If you're just trying to get through this to play the next one, you don't have to. The Witcher 1 isn't a blank slate either, so no matter which one you start playing, you'll feel like you only know part of the story. And if you insist, but just can't take an 80-hour game, just play it on easy so you can get through it quick and see what happens. That's where the Witcher does its best work. The story.","January 23","true","62.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"

I love games like The Witcher.\n\nIf you are into rpgs, adventuring, doing quests, killing monsters and extracting their body parts to craft different potions, challeging gameplay, and dialogue options, then get yourself in on the Witcher action!\n\nThe aesthetics are very well done, with lots of detail in the environment. During dialogue scenes, you can enjoy dynamic characters that will move and express their emotions (quite the opposite of Morrowin'd static, unmoving faces). Your character, Geralt, can also be a playboy (if you take him down the right dialogue paths), romancing many different characters. During the sex scenes, a card (with absolutely no value except that you can look at it again by checking the person's biography) with the woman in a revealing position will cover the dream-like sequence (which seems to be very similar for every person).\n\nThe music is pretty good, and the effects of skills and powers are great - my favorite being the cateye potion, which gives you the very useful ability of nightvision.\n\nThe story is pretty good, and the game is content-heavy with lore for anyone wanting more immersion into the Witcher universe. You can switch from a third-person perspective to a more top-down style camera if that suits you better. The game takes place exclusively in the castle city of Vizima, with Geralt wandering to surrounding areas for missions (but always returning to the main hub of Vizima).\n\nThe controls are fairly easy to get used to, especially if you are familiar with rpgs in the vein of Dragon Age and Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic. You queue your skills/actions, and timing is very important - properly pressing the attack button (mouse click) will allow you to continue your atack combos. There are three different Witcher stances you can use - fast, group, and heavy. These implement a sort of rock-paper-scissors style mechanic, where quick enemies are more susceptible to fast attacks; tanky blockers are bested by heavy strikes; and weak mobs fall to your group attack quickly.\n\nThe learning curve is moderate to difficult, there is a lot to do in the Witcher world. I am currently playing on the hardest difficulty, and I recommend you do so if you want the full experience. In this mode, crafting potions to buff Geralt (ex: higher criticals, poison damage, or increased endurance/stamina) is essential - you WILL die repeatedly if you do not utilize the potion mechanic. In the lower difficulties, you can get away with ignoring this aspect of the game. The tutorial questline is very good at helping you learn every aspect of the game, from skinning monsters to crafting potions to leveling up your skills.\n\nCrafting potions is an entire game in itself - whenever you defeat an opponent, you can usually loot their bodies (and taking some crafting ingredients in the process). There are books you can read (usually by purchasing them from vendors or finding them) that will allow you to extract a wider variety of crafting components from your kills. Many of the higher-tier potions require you to use rarer ingredients (which in turn require you to find the specific book that will teach you how to extract it).\n\nEnemies will also drop their weapons, and you can pick these up if you like (although they are usually weaker than Geralt's equipment). Geralt can equip his standard Witcher silver sword (strong against mythical creatures) or his steel sword (strong against normal humans), and two other secondary weapons (I have a large axe that has a bonus against shields, and a small axe that does extra piercing damage).\n\nInventory management is very good thanks to the auto-arrange feature.\n\nGeralt's interacttion with the environment is amazing. You can talk to most NPCs, some of which will accept gifts from you in exchange for (sometimes) special items. Later, you will find dice and can play a dice version of poker (which is extremely addicting). There is an entire questline where you can challenge different-tiered opponents until you become a professional. You can trade with characters/vendors, and you can even try to romance some if given the opportunity. You can even engage in drinking contests with certain individuals - winning (sometimes) special prizes if they tap out first. There is also a fight club in the taverns.\n\nOne of my favorite things about this game is the time-delayed consequences of your actions - usually not becoming evident until much later in the game. Also, there is no concrete "karma" system (ex: renegade/paragon, or jedi/sith) for your actions - so you are encouraged to play the game and make decisions how you actually would, rather than relying on a black-and-white karma system.\n\nThere is an abundance of side missions for you to do, and this is recommended to maximize your leveling potential. The upgrade tree is very good, as you can invest points into either silver or steel sword - and specific forms within those; overall agility, spells, crafting, etc. Currently, my Geralt is so proficient in his speed ratings that I can take out most enemies with either fast or group stance (and my group attack range is massive).\n\nAdmittedly, the combat is not always as smooth as I'd like, but much of this is improved upon in The Witcher 2. If you are interested, you should definitely play this one first because your save carries over. RPG buffs MUST give this classic a try if you haven't already.\n\nHighly recommend!","July 16, 2014","true","11.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/patmurf/recommended/20900/","patmurf","AFK Hero","http://steamcommunity.com/id/patmurf/","115 products in account","Note: This reviewer played this game for the first time in 2015\n\n\n\nStory: 9/10\nThe Witcher's strongest feature. The narrative in the game holds your attention due to its morally gray character motivations as well as its well realized central protagonist. Modern RPGs are plagued with the "fetch either an angel halo for the gods or a dead baby for the demons" choice system. The Witcher's choices are very gray at first glance, and for much of the game character motives are wonderfully opaque. This leads to real thought, and at times regret, for decisions you've made.\nThe other issue RPGs have is the "build your own protagonist" system a la Skyrim. This becomes tantamount to there being NO protagonist but instead a soulless fetch quest runner who gets to witness the other ACTUAL character fulfill their motivations. Geralt is his own man, with his own mindset. There is plenty of choice in this game, but no matter your decision, its Geralt making that choice in the narrative. If you kill someone it'll be in a way Geralt would kill them, and likewise if you show mercy. Choice is not diluted and neither is character development. It proves unbelievably refreshing in a world of nameless chosen ones out to fulfill some prophecy or whatever.\n\nSound: 8/10\nYou can tell The Witcher is a freshman effort by its dev team in a lot of technical places, and the sound is no exception. the farther you get into the script, the better the voice acting (and likely, the voice actors' directing) gets, even for characters we've known since the beginning. Its a small gripe but its there. The music is wonderfully moody and neither overpowers nor fails to be noticed. I have walked away humming numerous central melodies.\n\nGraphics 7/10\nI imagine I'm being cruel here, but it is nearly impossible to review an eight year game on the first playthrough with no knowledge of the gaming technologies of today. Having said that, The Witcher realizes its imagery well enough. Environments are focused on capturing realism and largely succeed. Character models serve well enough and have a large enough pool of animations to suffice, but in the end like all older Bioware engine RPGs, you become very familiar with how exactly someones hands will move when excited, happy, indignant, or surprised. Facial expressions are non existent, which unfortunately is probably the only thing holding its story from a 10/10. I imagine for its time, The Witcher was stunning.\n\nGameplay: 6/10\nSo many people will not make it to the best this game has to offer because of this. With a hindsight view of singleplayer ARPGs, The Witcher proved difficult to get into in terms of gameplay. Its either a hack n slash with the soul of Baulder's Gate, or the exact opposite, I'm not quite sure. All evasion/parrying is dice based, like a DnD rpg. All combat is based on clicking a target and essentially playing a rhythm game by clicking again at the next part of the attack combo. Clicking too early ends everything and leaves you vulnerable to damage. Also, The Witcher's combat is heavily influenced on its characterization of Witchers. This is fine, but it means you must know three fighting stances for three different scenarios with two different swords. Each fighting stance has its own tech tree on each sword, leading to 6(!) tech trees governing your auto attacks, all with essentially the same generic talent as the others. It can be maddening.\nOther aspects that plague the Witcher are its attempts follow realism into laughable conclusions. For example, drunkenness is a big thing in this game, but you walk so slow when drunk its not functional. You can sleep this off, but you can only rest at campfires or inns. There's no fast travel (I repeat: no fast travel) meaning on more than one occasion I took ten plus minutes of gameplay to stumble out of a house, into the street, down to the slums, and into an inn to sleep off the drunkenness. Other cases of this would be quests where someone asks for six monster teeth. You cannot simply kill six monsters. You must educate Geralt in how to properly extract monster teeth. You do that by reading books or finding someone who is willing to bring it up in casual conversation. There are almost no indicators of any kind within the game as to where this information is, and every tooth, tuft of hair, berry you pick, or potion you concoct requires a source of knowledge first. Couple that with, again, NO FAST TRAVEL, and youre going to be backtracking. a lot. And married to a witcher wiki if you're a completionist.\n\nReplayability 8/10\nI am already planning to attack this game again with my new understanding of its mechanics, as well as apply my knowledge of the world come the end of it to the events that occur in the beginning. There is a plethora of choices and changes in this game, all of which tempt the player to return again.\n\nOVERALL: 9/10\nI realize only the plot scored this high, but the Witcher truly is a whole lot more than the sum of its parts. I highly suggest playing it now, as the window of its first-play-through-enjoyability is closing. Newer and shinier games with simpler, more user friendly systems will come to make hindsight playthroughs of The Witcher like mine a task too onerous to tackle. This is a real shame, as the Witcher tells a story like books do, with various motives and questionable decisions. It skirts so many videogame narrative tropes of "The Chosen One" or the "Mute Protagonist" and pulls itself above the rest because of this. Play this now, before you can't stomach it, or windows can't run it.\n\n\n\n","May 27, 2015","true","73.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

So this game atleast for me took about 45 hours give or take and you can probably do it in less. Would I reccommend the game for its story 100% but there are some issues that the game has regardless of its amazing story. First I'll start off with the positives story, setting, lore and all of that are so fasinating. The dialogue in this game can also be so golden and this game has a cast of very memorable characters. Now the downsides the combat is really basic and not really unique. The sword play is a combo system based on timing your clicks and not really special and trying to use abilities in tandem feels really clunky so combat is nothing that special. Also sometimes in certain sections of the game it just starts performing poorly, I will be running this game 60 fps maxed out and everythings fine then suddenly in certain areas and sections of the game everything goes to ♥♥♥♥. Now despite its faults this is still a fantastic game story wise and is extremely compelling, I would find time escaping me as I would play this game as oh ♥♥♥♥ suddenly its like 2 or 3 am and I need to go to bed. Also I just remembered this the crafting system in the game is really unique but only on the alchemy side when your making potions besides that I never needed to make bombs and never saw a use for them and also I just got so much grease and such from drops that I hardly ever had to make any.\n11/10 story like woah\n7/10 Overall","July 23, 2015","true","26.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I'll admit that it took me a few tries to get into this game; this was part due to its different combat system. The Witcher’s combat isn't about blindly clicking the mouse, but instead requires timing to effectively chain a number of progressively stronger attacks together (sort of a really cut down fighter’s style of combos) as well as picking the right fighting style for the situation.\nThe equippable item system in Witcher is rather basic. If you’re looking for a Diabloesce game with an exorbitant amount of different weapons and armour, you won’t find it here. Fundamentally, you’ll use 2 unique swords and a set of armour. These items have a couple of upgrades as the game progresses, but for the most part, that’s all you’ll use.\nThe real item aspect of the Witcher is with its “power ups”. You’ll spend most of your time looting corpses and objects in search of crafting components to create potions, bombs and weapon boosts.\nI thought the levelling system in the game could have been a little more interesting. Every time you level up, you get certain kinds of skill points to allocate to a skill tree. These points mostly just influence your character’s numbers (extra damage, extra resistances, extra chances to dodge) and don’t necessarily feel noticeable. You do get to chain more attacks as you level those skills, but perhaps some completely new abilities as you level to show your advancement may help?\nThe visuals were quite good, especially given the game came out in 2008. I especially liked the look of the combat as well as the visual effect on the weapons when “power up” items were applied to them. My biggest con for this game however was the repetitive character models. You will run into the same NPCs and enemies models a LOT.\nLastly, the story. The Witcher story was quite enjoyable with a rather hefty length to it. The game offers you a lot of opportunities to make decisions, but ultimately the game’s outcome will be the same. We’re offer 3 endings, based on a few key decisions, with different set dressings along the way based on other decisions. In saying that though, I did get invested in the story and had wished some of my decisions had had different outcomes in the story.\nOverall, a very enjoyable game and I’m looking forward to playing the sequel, Witcher 2. Should you so choose, your save file from Witcher 1 can be imported into Witcher 2, so that your decisions  and equipment following you, allowing it to really feel like it’s a continuation of your character.\nIt you enjoy your stored driven RPG and have the time and patients to invest into a long story, I’d recommend giving The Witcher a try.\n","August 24, 2015","true","117.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

You do get to chain more attacks as you level those skills, but perhaps some completely new abilities as you level to show your advancement may help?\nThe visuals were quite good, especially given the game came out in 2008. I especially liked the look of the combat as well as the visual effect on the weapons when “power up” items were applied to them. My biggest con for this game however was the repetitive character models. You will run into the same NPCs and enemies models a LOT.\nLastly, the story. The Witcher story was quite enjoyable with a rather hefty length to it. The game offers you a lot of opportunities to make decisions, but ultimately the game’s outcome will be the same. We’re offer 3 endings, based on a few key decisions, with different set dressings along the way based on other decisions. In saying that though, I did get invested in the story and had wished some of my decisions had had different outcomes in the story.\nOverall, a very enjoyable game and I’m looking forward to playing the sequel, Witcher 2. Should you so choose, your save file from Witcher 1 can be imported into Witcher 2, so that your decisions  and equipment following you, allowing it to really feel like it’s a continuation of your character.\nIt you enjoy your stored driven RPG and have the time and patients to invest into a long story, I’d recommend giving The Witcher a try.\n","August 24, 2015","true","117.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

On the one hand, the game is great, it has amazing dialogues, storyline, quests, lore, characters, etc. - it is obvious that PC Project did a great job. However, I highly advise to read the actual novel prior to playing this game, or many things might be totally unclear to you (the entire story of 7 books is very long though, and it is understandable that not many people have enough time to do it) or at least, try to find the Polish movie of 2000 (which is a crap though).\n\nUnfortunately, the Witcher series are not that popular as Game of Thrones in North America, which becomes a problem because majority of people know nothing of this Universe and what had happened in the world prior to this game - and there were lots of things happening. I ll try to summarize everything in one sentence - a war had happened which united the Northern Kingdoms against an army of Southerners, the war was won - at the same time, there is a huge Elven rebellion happening, and of course, Witchers, the mystique organization which had sworn to protect humans from evil, is slowly disapepearing from the public. Geralt is among the last ones to survive.\n\nOf course, devs did a good job explain everything from the start, but still the game has enormous amount of flashbacks which test your knowledge of the series, and in order to enjoy the game in full extent it is advisable to know what the heck is going on at least.\n\nOn the other hand, there is some element of uncertainty. A. Sapkowski, the original author of the series, made it clear several years ago that the story of Witcher did not end in his books yet, and if I understand it correctly - he is working on another book currently. In this way, I am just very confused whether how this game as well as Witcher 2 and 3, would fit into Universe. But this is a question which cannot be answered yet. For now, I give a strong A + to the game.\n\n9 / 10","October 27, 2015","true","277.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

My opinion doesn't differ alot from most of the positive reviews: The Witcher 1 is a game with a well-designed story which is based on the witcher-novels of Andrzej Sapkowski,  astounishing graphics (at least back in it's release-days in 2008), complexe quests and tough/impactful decisions as well as memorable characters...\n\nYet it also suffers from certain problems, mainly considering the fighting system and (from todays perspective) some lesser gameplay issues as well as "bad" graphics and a very deep lore which needs quite some time to be fully understood. This may scare you off if you're not 100% determined to finish this game.\n\nIn my opinion one should watch some gameplay videos or read the first novel before considering to play this game. This will make it easier to understand the lore and might also give you some determination to play it. All in all one could say that it's worth playing for the sale price of one dollar/euro...","January 26","true","2.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It's 2016 as I write this, and I refuse to play The Witcher 3 until I beat the previous two, and we all know that I have to play The Witcher 3... I HAVE TO! I am now 50-something hours into this beast and I'm not gonna lie to you, it is a ♥♥♥♥ing grind sometimes. Collect ten of these, bring this to there, grind money, farm herbs... It reminds me of some of the worst parts of WoW at its low points. There's also The Witcher's graphics, which, in its day, probably would have melted my face off like the ark of the covenant, but now they're pretty rough. The gameplay is equally dated and suffers from some truely bizarre implementation choices (Parapa the Rappa style combat?). It takes grit to get through it sometimes.\n\nBut despite all of that, there is a seed of greatness taking root here. Even by modern standards, the original Witcher has an incredible depth to its mechanics (flawed as they are), and a richness of character and storytelling that is woefully lacking in most games (even modern RPGs). There's no black and white moral scale here to define your actions. No need to max out your good or evil points to get this or that ability. Just choices. You make choices and you live with the consequences. That's the price of admission. Sometimes you'll make a choice, and twenty hours later that ♥♥♥♥ will come back to bite you in the ♥♥♥, and it's not because you made the wrong choice, but because there wasn't a right choice. This game's not about finding the optimal path of least resistance. It's about moral ambiguity, and the story of an active participant in history, ♥♥♥♥-ups and all. This game made me step away from my keyboard a few times to think it over before I made my choices. I agonized over them sometimes, but in the end, no matter the outcome, it always felt right.\n\nI will say this however: If you're just trying to get through this to play the next one, you don't have to. The Witcher 1 isn't a blank slate either, so no matter which one you start playing, you'll feel like you only know part of the story. And if you insist, but just can't take an 80-hour game, just play it on easy so you can get through it quick and see what happens. That's where the Witcher does its best work. The story.","January 23","true","62.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/djsoulfck/recommended/20900/","djsoulfck","DJSF - off @ twitch.tv/sinlike","http://steamcommunity.com/id/djsoulfck/","416 products in account","When it comes to action rpg/adventure games - which is easily my favorite genre - the two games I've played for the longest in my entire life were Diablo II and The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind. I love games like The Witcher.\n\nIf you are into rpgs, adventuring, doing quests, killing monsters and extracting their body parts to craft different potions, challeging gameplay, and dialogue options, then get yourself in on the Witcher action!\n\nThe aesthetics are very well done, with lots of detail in the environment. During dialogue scenes, you can enjoy dynamic characters that will move and express their emotions (quite the opposite of Morrowin'd static, unmoving faces). Your character, Geralt, can also be a playboy (if you take him down the right dialogue paths), romancing many different characters. During the sex scenes, a card (with absolutely no value except that you can look at it again by checking the person's biography) with the woman in a revealing position will cover the dream-like sequence (which seems to be very similar for every person).\n\nThe music is pretty good, and the effects of skills and powers are great - my favorite being the cateye potion, which gives you the very useful ability of nightvision.\n\nThe story is pretty good, and the game is content-heavy with lore for anyone wanting more immersion into the Witcher universe. You can switch from a third-person perspective to a more top-down style camera if that suits you better. The game takes place exclusively in the castle city of Vizima, with Geralt wandering to surrounding areas for missions (but always returning to the main hub of Vizima).\n\nThe controls are fairly easy to get used to, especially if you are familiar with rpgs in the vein of Dragon Age and Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic. You queue your skills/actions, and timing is very important - properly pressing the attack button (mouse click) will allow you to continue your atack combos. There are three different Witcher stances you can use - fast, group, and heavy. These implement a sort of rock-paper-scissors style mechanic, where quick enemies are more susceptible to fast attacks; tanky blockers are bested by heavy strikes; and weak mobs fall to your group attack quickly.\n\nThe learning curve is moderate to difficult, there is a lot to do in the Witcher world. I am currently playing on the hardest difficulty, and I recommend you do so if you want the full experience. In this mode, crafting potions to buff Geralt (ex: higher criticals, poison damage, or increased endurance/stamina) is essential - you WILL die repeatedly if you do not utilize the potion mechanic. In the lower difficulties, you can get away with ignoring this aspect of the game. The tutorial questline is very good at helping you learn every aspect of the game, from skinning monsters to crafting potions to leveling up your skills.\n\nCrafting potions is an entire game in itself - whenever you defeat an opponent, you can usually loot their bodies (and taking some crafting ingredients in the process). There are books you can read (usually by purchasing them from vendors or finding them) that will allow you to extract a wider variety of crafting components from your kills. Many of the higher-tier potions require you to use rarer ingredients (which in turn require you to find the specific book that will teach you how to extract it).\n\nEnemies will also drop their weapons, and you can pick these up if you like (although they are usually weaker than Geralt's equipment). Geralt can equip his standard Witcher silver sword (strong against mythical creatures) or his steel sword (strong against normal humans), and two other secondary weapons (I have a large axe that has a bonus against shields, and a small axe that does extra piercing damage).\n\nInventory management is very good thanks to the auto-arrange feature.\n\nGeralt's interacttion with the environment is amazing. You can talk to most NPCs, some of which will accept gifts from you in exchange for (sometimes) special items. Later, you will find dice and can play a dice version of poker (which is extremely addicting). There is an entire questline where you can challenge different-tiered opponents until you become a professional. You can trade with characters/vendors, and you can even try to romance some if given the opportunity. You can even engage in drinking contests with certain individuals - winning (sometimes) special prizes if they tap out first. There is also a fight club in the taverns.\n\nOne of my favorite things about this game is the time-delayed consequences of your actions - usually not becoming evident until much later in the game. Also, there is no concrete "karma" system (ex: renegade/paragon, or jedi/sith) for your actions - so you are encouraged to play the game and make decisions how you actually would, rather than relying on a black-and-white karma system.\n\nThere is an abundance of side missions for you to do, and this is recommended to maximize your leveling potential. The upgrade tree is very good, as you can invest points into either silver or steel sword - and specific forms within those; overall agility, spells, crafting, etc. Currently, my Geralt is so proficient in his speed ratings that I can take out most enemies with either fast or group stance (and my group attack range is massive).\n\nAdmittedly, the combat is not always as smooth as I'd like, but much of this is improved upon in The Witcher 2. If you are interested, you should definitely play this one first because your save carries over. RPG buffs MUST give this classic a try if you haven't already.\n\nHighly recommend!","July 16, 2014","true","11.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Talking with the characters is a huge part in completing the numerous main and side quests. What you say matters, as each possible line might cause something different, it can mean a mass slaughtering or a problem solved in a peaceful way. Certain characters will help you or not depending on what desicions you made in the past.\n\nIt is known that combat is a weak part of the game, but it is not as bad as people make it out to be. Sure, it is not the same as the later Witchers' but it isn't that awful. When you put the cursor over an enemy, it will turn into a sword, that's when you can attack. Clicking mid-action stops the attack. Clicking when the sword is flaming starts a chain of attacks. Depending on what type of enemy you are fighting, you will use a different sword. The steel sword is used against humans, elves, dwarfs, dogs, while the silver one is used against monsters. Three fighting styles are available, depending on if the enemy is a strong or light type, or you are fighting a group of enemies.\n\nWitchers have the ability to use signs - they provide specials powers such as telecinetic blasts, shields, making enemies your allies and more. As the game progresses you will find them all. Geralt can brew potions - large part of the game, especially if you are playing on a higher difficulity, make oil - to enhance his swords and deal more damage, and craft bombs.\n\nStory is also amazing, but considering the game is made after a book, it's not surprising. People say that the second and third game's stories are more important, though, so what do I know.\n\nAlong with the game, you get adventures, I guess they could be called free DLC. They are small main quests, not tied to the story. An adventure editor also comes with them.\n\nOverall, this is a must play for RPG fans out there and considering it goes as low as an euro during sales, it's a great deal as the game can provide over 30 hours of fun.","December 12, 2015","true","56.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","1"

The question for today's player isn't so much if the game is worth your money but rather if it's worth your time. The answer, in true Witcher fashion, isn't entirely black and white.\n\nThe game for me was, overall, enjoyable.  The combat system is unique, and regardless of it's mixed reviews, I found it to be a serviceable and even somewhat cool RPG combat system. The finishers tend to get a bit repetitive but add a nice, and gruesome, touch. Although the main story isn't incredibly epic, the decisions that you make along the way feel like they are, and have a significant impact on certain characters fates.  I particularly enjoyed the economic system in the early to mid-game, when you actually feel like you need to put in work to earn those Orens, because everyone has their hand in your coin pouch, and everything you want to accomplish has a price.  Unfortunately this fades towards the end of the game as there simply isn't anything left to buy and no one left to bribe. Graphically the game doesn't look bad, it’s got its hiccups sure, but nothing that interferes with playability.\n\nGeralt, despite being one of the ugliest human beings I've ever seen in this particular game, somehow manages to slay more women than monsters--quite an accomplishment considering aptitude for his profession.  The dude simply can't miss, and it's undeniably entertaining to see just how many naughty cards you can collect.  It also adds an interesting layer of complexity to Geralt's ongoing romance with a certain red-haired sorceress.  No matter how serious their relationship tries to become, the White Wolf simply can't stop banging other women.  Relationships are hard. Players unfamiliar with the series may find Geralt's character at first take to be bland, dull, or flat out boring.  However, once you begin to understand his complexities, his sarcastic and cynical nature, and his convictions, you'll surely come to appreciate this incredibly rich and interesting character as so many others have.\n\nThe world map by today's standards is pretty small but the game easily has 50 hours of content.  This translates into A TON of backtracking.  By the end of Chapter II I was more familiar with the streets of Vizima than my own neighborhood, which is great because the mini-map is zoomed in way too far and makes navigation a little frustrating.  I often found myself needing to open the world map just to find a house that was actually ten feet away.  NPCs carry on with their daily lives, which at first seems pretty cool, until you're searching for one for twenty minutes because he's not getting drunk at the inn for once and he's slipped off his magical RPG quest-tracking bracelet.  Because Geralt's a Witcher, monster contracts play a role in the game, unfortunately most of them are simply kill X number of Y monster and turn in their eyes/teeth/skins/whatever.  One of them even has Geralt collecting flowers...??! That's like hiring Agent 47 to assassinate a weed in your garden.\n\nThe recycling of NPC textures is somewhat distracting but doesn't ruin the experience.  Expect though, to see the same fat guy, skinny guy, and half-naked hooker models reused over and over throughout your adventure. The game also suffers painfully from a gear shortage.  I found myself using the same armor and two swords throughout most of my adventure. The difficulty on normal is average, as it should be, but does have some frustrating moments.  Too many enemy groups have to ability to stun-lock Geralt, causing him to stagger like a drunken derelict as you helplessly pound on your peripherals for way longer than any doctor recommends.\n\nMini-games are present; dice poker has you playing poker by rolling dice instead of drawing cards and is ok at first but you'll quickly get tired of it.  There are also fist fights which pit Geralt against an array of fighters of supposedly increasing difficulty, however, once you figure out the somewhat wonky fighting mechanics you'll be able to beat the crap out of even the strongest opponents with virtually no effort. Overall, the mini-games felt like they could have been left out and, much like me at a party, no one would have even noticed they weren’t there.\n\nNow, we circle back to our original question; is The Witcher worth your time in 2016?  As a fan of The Witcher 3 I certainly found it to be worth mine.  Despite it's age and other concerns, the game is still pretty darn good.  If you're completely new to the series it would seem like the obvious place to start but I would actually recommend starting with the Witcher 3 and working back to this one. Many may not agree, but the game is 50 hours long and sometimes feels like a slog. If you're not already invested in these stories and characters, and the lore of this world, playing this game first, as a contemporary player, could potentially turn you off to the entire franchise and that would be a shame.  If you're a fan of the Witcher 3, like me, and want to experience more content from this world, then there's no reason not to give this game a spin.\n\nFinal score: 7/10 RECOMMENDED.\n\nThank you for reading and good hunting","June 4","true","52.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Voice acting is horrible, animations are awful and the combat system is boring. You will spend most of your time running from 1 location to the other doing fetch quests or just aimlessly wandering around until you find a solution to a quest.\nThe issues I had with the combat is that it resembles a clicker game. After chapter 2 you will find yourself dying over and over in certain missions because they decided that you can go 1 v 10 against a room full of enemies. I wouldn't mind this if it weren't for a total stunlock when the enemies surround you, at which point death is certain.\nFor newcomers I would recommend downloading these mods to make the experience somewhat better:\n- The witcher texturen mod - improves textures for environments and objects\n- The witcher hi res character models - improves textures for characters\n- Item Stacking and Equipment Slots Mod - you will need this if you don't plan on organising your inventory every 5 minutes\n- Faster Movement Mod - this mod increases your movement speed by 25% but can be changed to even more. The game makes you run around, alot. The issue here is that the maps are pretty big and if you plan on doing sidequests you will be running all over the place and the default movement speed is lousy. If you don't want to uninstall after 1 hour pick this up.\n\nIf you came only for the story you will be satisfied, but only if you don't mind all the shortcomings. An added bonus is that you can import your choices into The Witcher 2.","June 14, 2015","true","38.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

It is a sequel to a series of fantasy novels centering around it's protagonist, Geralt of Rivia. In this game, after his apparent death in the novels. He awakes with amnesia and no recollection of his death nor the people in his life. After that he is launched on a quest of revenge as he remembers who he is.\n\nOne of the finest aspects of the Witcher is how it's quests are designed. You are never shown the consequences of your actions immediately. Instead, in later chapters of the game you see the results of your choices. This was done to prevent players simply reloading and not accepting the consequences of their actions. As a result your actions really do feel like they have weight, and it's rare to see this executed properly in a game.\n\nThere are of course negative aspects of the Witcher. Most people cite it's combat as the biggest drawback of the game. I'm inclined to agree, as I initially stopped playing just before finishing the prologue. My advice is to push on past the prologue as you start to really get into the game during it's first chapter. Eventually you will fall inlove with this game and it's timing based combat.","June 14, 2013","true","18.3"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","3"

No. This game expands the main storyline very, very well. Good job Poland, you have created something that no one will forget. One of the best RPGs ever made.\nSTORY:\nThe story, as I said before, expands the storyline from the books, and adds something more to it, the game starts with the witcher, Geralt, that looses his memory, is taken to Kael Morhen, the ancient witcher castle, which is now half destroyed and almost empty. The prologue and then the first chapters of the game may seem a little boring and slow, but after it game takes on regarding what decisions you make.\nGAMEPLAY:\nFor new players, gameplay in prologue is the main thing why the most players stop playing after 10 minutes of the game. The combat system is based on the right timing clicking, so that confuses most people. Geralt can carry up to 3 swords and 1 optional dagger, another small weapon or torch. Also witcher "spells" called signs are introduced, without it it's not witcher after all.\nIn game, players have also 2 gameplay styles, that can be changed through gameplay,\n1st is common keyboard+mouse, where you use keys for weapons and movement and mouse for attacking and actions\n2nd one is mouse and optional keyboard, this style is made only for mouse, so you move your character by clicking on the ground, but keys can be also used.\nThe game can seem very linear, always it's only kill something, deliver something, talk to someone, do something etc. but changing of environment and locations this lineaness pretty lifts.\n\nPros:\n+ The story (unexpected plot twists yay)\n+ Awesome soundtrack\n+ Characters\n+ Game stands on your decisions (no turning back, make decisions or don't play)\n+ Ummmm\n\nCons:\n- That sometimes, linear story (it will tear your hair if you have any)\n- It's easy (unlike second game, this one lets you take potions in combat, and save everywhere you want, everywhere)\n- The game holds your hand like a little child (it's easy)\n\nIt's still worth (very) playing\n8.5/10 (why? Because 8 is too less and 9 is too much)","March 8, 2014","true","37.7"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","62","8","13","0","1"

No, there's no big morality bar telling you whether what you do leads you to being Mother Theresse or Satan. There's actually an inticant way of making it work in the long run, a concequence for your action that was done way long ago(hopefully you didn't forget about it). There's no boring conversations, the combat is solid enough(hard to belive it's the Aurora engine from Neverwinter Nights 2). The whole theme features a nice slavic mythology on a pretty big level with a lot of lore and such. Definetely worth buying if one is looking for a more mature experience.","December 21, 2011","true","105.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The Witcher is quite possibly the pinnacle of Action/RPG games.\n\nThe game boasts an old-timey combat system based on stringing together specifically timed attacks into combos that works very well for this game. The types of attack combinations performed are based on specific combat styles that players must switch between based on the situations they find themselves in. Geralt, the main character, can progressively strengthen his combat capabilities by leveling up and spending talent points to lengthen his combos, increase his damage output, increase his alchemical abilities, and much more. The character development aspect of this game is very well done in that it allows players to upgrade Geralt more or less to their own specific play style based on how they wish to spend their talent points. The storyline of this game is really quite remarkable, and its nonlinearity allows players to explore the open world that they are in to their hearts' desire. The quality of the storyline is only compounded by the game's morality system, for which it has recieved much praise. Morality in the Witcher is not a cleanly-cut black-and-white morality system, and the heavy presence of moral gray-areas allow players to judge morality for themselves rather than on the game's own terms and face the consequences of the decisions they make.\n\nAll in all, the Witcher is a fantastic Action/RPG game, and everyone who is a fan of these types of games will not be dissapointed by it. It is absolutely worth buying even at full price, and is a marvellous and refreshing gaming experience for fans of the Action/RPG gaming genre.","July 9, 2014","true","46.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

This game is not about levelling your character or killing tons of creatures with one swing of your sword. It's about playing o role - a ROLE playing game.\n\nYou play as a witcher, a mutant that kills beasts. It's based on famous books series by Andrzej Sapkowski. Since you are a mutant, not every person likes you. More of that, you always have to chose how to behave, whos side to take.\n\nIt's a first game by polish studio CD Project RED, so it's not brilliant, but you immediately forget about all it's cons when you start playing because a rare game can get you suck a real roleplay experience, such dark fantasy world, where everything is corruted, dark and still people survive and see bright things.","July 8, 2014","true","15.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

My first impression was that the game had suppen frame-drops and clunky controls and did not like it at all in the beginning. However, it only took me about 2-3 hours to fall in love with this game.\n\nWhat I liked most about this game was the story. It was one of the reasons I got so addicted to the game. The clunky controls did not bother me, because the story was so interesting and unique. I also really liked the Level system. It had alot of variation, for example upgrading your magic skills, health, making your combat moves look smoother and even make Geralt do backflips!\n\nOne of the things most people hate the most is the combat. You click on the enemy and look at Geralt do some swings and wait until the sword (mouse pointer) have flames on it and then click again for a 2nd combo. I personally had no problem with this type of combat and actually enjoyed it a lot. But I understand why people dislike it, but it really depends on your style and what you like.\n\nThe biggest complains I have with this game is the clunky controls and sudden game crashes (which can be really annoying if you don't save the game often). But I've heard that the game auto-saves if you press f5, which I didn't know until after I finished the game and started on The Witcher 2.\n\nOverall, I think this a very good RPG game from an amazing franshise that I recommend for those who like dark, sexy and actionpacked RPGs, and  I therefore give this game a strong 8/10.","June 14, 2015","true","54.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

The Witcher is sadly overlooked by most mainstream gamers. RPG focus is stolen by games such as Skyrim, Fallout, and Dragon age. All of those are great games, but the Witcher is something special.  The witcher gives you many moral choices that are difficult to decide. They actually make a huge difference in the outcome of the game as well. The game gives you somewhat of a blank slate, and forces you to choose what you believe in, who you  trust, and what is right or wrong.  The Witcher has tons of nudity, so don't play this near young ones. A good playthrough will take 40 hours or so, but will allow you the ability to import your save file into the Witcher 2. It is also worth mentioning that the modding community has made many wonderful mods for this game. I was playing with some HD texture mods, and some interface re-works. These make the game a joy to play even this many years after its creation. If you are an RPG fan, you owe it to yourself to sit down and recount the tales from Geralt of Rivia.

Choices are rarely laid out in front of you and always have a significant impact later in the game.\n\nRecommendation: this game is everything that Bioware RPGs wishes they were, but the low budget and (probable)inexperience of CDProjektRed in 2007 hides the good behind multiple layers of clunk and awkward.\n\nSide Note: Assassin of Kings succeeds in virtually every area that this game fails, so it's an obvious choice over this game, but they allow you to import a save with all your choices, so I'd say The Witcher is worth suffering through to get the best experience out of the sequel, even if you hate its guts.","April 6, 2015","true","66.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

After putting it off twice now, I've finally beat this long, incredible game. I know some people will say it wasn't too long but I tried to get as much out of it as I could. Anyway, on to the review, in this game you play as Geralt of Rivia. A witcher, which is basically a human that was trained from birth to hunt monsters and remove curses. Also, as part of the process, the witcher finally earns his name sake by completeing the trial of the grasses which is a long process involving taking mutagens which (if the human survives) transforms him into a mutant which gives him faster reflexes, better vision, and all that good stuff but at the cost of infertility.\nAt the beginning you discover Geralt has lost his memory and is wounded but winds up on the steps of Khear Moren (sp?), basically the school and home for the Witchers. There he is nursed back to health by his fellow witchers and Triss Merigold, a sorcess and love interest. Just as Geralt is getting back on his feet, a group of thugs assisted by a couple powerful mages attack the castle. After a short battle, wherein you choose to help fight the monster that the mage brought with them or if you choose to go to the laboratory with Triss to stop them from stealing the Witchers secrets, you decide to split up to different corners of the world to find your groups lost secrets and to seek revenge on the group that attacked and so begins the game.\nThe game is kind of hard to explain on paper, but I'll try my best. First off, combat isn't like in most games... when fighting anything you have to click on the target and Geralt will start attacking in a predetermined manner whereas during the attack your sword icon will light up between yellow and orange then go back to gray, during this time you have to click on the target again during the yellow/orange phase to follow through with a four step combo, the longer you prolong the combo the more damage that is done ending in a finisher stage which deals the most damage. Also, depending on your target, there is a lot of prep that goes into the fight before actually fighting. You have to consider the target, is it human or monster? If its human you must use your steel weapon or sword. If its monster, you must use your witchers silver sword, something you get in the second chapter of the game (there are 4 chapters and an epilogue). Then once you determine between human or monster, you must figure out if the target is a large target or small target because large targets require a strong attack stance and small targets require a small attack stance... usually. You can quickly switch between the three stances (the third being a group stance which is pretty good during almost all fights and covers both large and small targets) by pausing the game and selecting the stance, then resuming. Most of the time its all trial and error, if you attack a small framed guy and he seems to be dodging or parrying your attacks, switch to the strong and that'll drop him. Sometimes, if you get good enough and your skills improve, you can use most any attack stance on any size target with greater result (small/singular target + strong stance with improved skills = 2 hit kill). Then there is the oils and stones and such... some stones can imbue your swords with different effects for short periods of time, just apply before battle because he actually has to apply it. Same goes for oils, but the oils do different things, like making a target bleed more, causing more pain (causes the target to attack slower/move slower), and then theres the oils for different kinds of monsters. Like necrophage oil, causes more damage to ghosts. Insectoid oil, causes more damage to insect like monsters. And theres an oil that causes the blades to do more damage to dragons and such, the list goes on and that alone is complex.\nYou also have magic that you learn by visiting stones scattered about the world. They give you powers like Aard, which is like force push from SW or just a strong burst of wind. Theres 5 total I believe but I only ever used Aard because when you level it up you can knock down multiple targets or even if you want to just quickly move through an area and theres one monster/human blocking the path you can sometimes stun the target which leaves them open for an instant melee kill. I also forgot to mention above that, just like the instant kills, fighting in general is very quick and visceral. Lots of blood flies around, wounds will appear, sometimes heads will roll but its a very satisfying part of the game. Just as with the magic and melee, as you progress through the game and level up, you gain points in the form of tokens which varies as you get higer level. These tokens are bronze, silver and gold and the skills you can buy follow the same form of scale being bronze is basic and gold is the best.\nAs you progress through the game you will encounter tons of characters, often ones you can interact with. Some will give you missions, others will just say a few set things and continue about their business. As mentioned earlier, there is decision making opportunities that present themselves several times in the game and will always effect the game later down the road. So pick your decisions wisely and don't listen to the inner dialogue or other characters when they push you to pick a side... its totally possible (and apparently the prefered choice) to play the neutral part.\nThe game can get tedious though... as one could imagine from my intro, this is the third time I've played it and actually the first time of successfully completing it. There are a few dull parts in the game, which I liken to the Song of Ice and Fire series from Martin, if you're familiar with them... when its boring its really dull but when it gets good its so damn good! Try to break up the dull parts by doing monster contracts which you can find at the local taverns, right outside on the billboard. Each chapter usually has like 6 different contracts posted and they'll always fetch decent money. But as for the story, probably one of the best games I've played and I really look forward to the next chapter in the series as the ending is left pretty open no matter what ending you get (there are 3 different kinds). I highly recommend this game just go in with an open mind and try to remember to think things through if you're stuck or try different strategies, because thats what this game is all about.","April 6, 2015","true","73.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The usage of folklore to create an archaic kind of fantasy magic and monsters is something I only remember from Darklands (an ancient RPG in medieval Germany where all folklore and hexes were equally true). Nice interconnection of event, nice ambiguity in the choices. Graphics are dated but still able to convey the story and atmosphere very well.\n\nThe bad:\nI was finishing this to get my Witcher fix for Witcher 3 and the controls are jarring and some elements of the combat like stun chains (which can happen to you without anything to do about it) can be plain frustrating. The inventory is kind of a mess. Sometimes you run around the same areas the xth time and I'd really liked a fast travel because this world has none of the emergent stories a real open world RPG has. By today's standards the world tiles are really small and you still need tons of time to traverse them.\n\nThe ambigious:\nTo some the preset of the character Geralt (the main protagonist of the novels) might feel a bit limiting but it helps to create a deeper story as the character of Geralt is defined to a large degree. Themes are mature with excessive romance to the point of self parody but also a pretty dark world where none is 100% good.\n\nConclusion:\nThis is primarily a story driven game and I only played it for that. In that sense they could have thrown out plenty of the decisions (which do not have very deep impact on the story anyway) and it would still be interesting to see the relations of fleshed out characters and a well established world.\n\nI would recommend the story, but cannot blame anyone taking shortcuts on the gameplay.\n","May 10, 2015","true","13.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It will set basis for you knowledge in the universe of The Witcher, and even though it’s a long game (for me 77 hours my first play trough), I felt it was totally worth it, and very rewarding. The game plays different than in The Witcher 2, instead on focusing on skill play, it focuses on tactics like alchemy and oil coating, etc. It may not sound good, but it is pretty fun. Plus the tactical knowledge carries over to the following games, letting you play I higher difficulties than before.\nThe length of the game was in my opinion perfect, it didn’t felt repetitive, or like being obligated to do chores. Heck, I got bored of Alien Isolation halfway through the entire game which only lasted about 15 hours. I just don’t play games for long, still, this is my second most played game of all time, I would never had tough!!!\nFor the price you get all this content, it is just a crime not to get, less than $2 for in sale sure.\nThe only thing you have to get pass to is the gameplay, if you come from The Witcher 2 like me, don’t quit in the introduction because of the combat.

The combat is terrible, the character progression is terrible, the inventory management is terrible, the game's auto save system is completely sentient and makes its own damn rules, Act III comes with a hearty helping of cpu usage issues with a nice side of micro-stutter, oh and bad voice acting combined with robotic facial animations makes Geralt being hit on and getting laid constantly extremely awkward and uncomfortable. BUT, even with all that, play this game. The stories are well written and have numerous outcomes based entirely on the way you do things. Choices are rarely laid out in front of you and always have a significant impact later in the game.\n\nRecommendation: this game is everything that Bioware RPGs wishes they were, but the low budget and (probable)inexperience of CDProjektRed in 2007 hides the good behind multiple layers of clunk and awkward.\n\nSide Note: Assassin of Kings succeeds in virtually every area that this game fails, so it's an obvious choice over this game, but they allow you to import a save with all your choices, so I'd say The Witcher is worth suffering through to get the best experience out of the sequel, even if you hate its guts.","April 6, 2015","true","66.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

After putting it off twice now, I've finally beat this long, incredible game. I know some people will say it wasn't too long but I tried to get as much out of it as I could. Anyway, on to the review, in this game you play as Geralt of Rivia. A witcher, which is basically a human that was trained from birth to hunt monsters and remove curses. Also, as part of the process, the witcher finally earns his name sake by completeing the trial of the grasses which is a long process involving taking mutagens which (if the human survives) transforms him into a mutant which gives him faster reflexes, better vision, and all that good stuff but at the cost of infertility.\nAt the beginning you discover Geralt has lost his memory and is wounded but winds up on the steps of Khear Moren (sp?), basically the school and home for the Witchers. There he is nursed back to health by his fellow witchers and Triss Merigold, a sorcess and love interest. Just as Geralt is getting back on his feet, a group of thugs assisted by a couple powerful mages attack the castle. After a short battle, wherein you choose to help fight the monster that the mage brought with them or if you choose to go to the laboratory with Triss to stop them from stealing the Witchers secrets, you decide to split up to different corners of the world to find your groups lost secrets and to seek revenge on the group that attacked and so begins the game.\nThe game is kind of hard to explain on paper, but I'll try my best. First off, combat isn't like in most games... when fighting anything you have to click on the target and Geralt will start attacking in a predetermined manner whereas during the attack your sword icon will light up between yellow and orange then go back to gray, during this time you have to click on the target again during the yellow/orange phase to follow through with a four step combo, the longer you prolong the combo the more damage that is done ending in a finisher stage which deals the most damage. Also, depending on your target, there is a lot of prep that goes into the fight before actually fighting. You have to consider the target, is it human or monster? If its human you must use your steel weapon or sword. If its monster, you must use your witchers silver sword, something you get in the second chapter of the game (there are 4 chapters and an epilogue). Then once you determine between human or monster, you must figure out if the target is a large target or small target because large targets require a strong attack stance and small targets require a small attack stance... usually. You can quickly switch between the three stances (the third being a group stance which is pretty good during almost all fights and covers both large and small targets) by pausing the game and selecting the stance, then resuming. Most of the time its all trial and error, if you attack a small framed guy and he seems to be dodging or parrying your attacks, switch to the strong and that'll drop him. Sometimes, if you get good enough and your skills improve, you can use most any attack stance on any size target with greater result (small/singular target + strong stance with improved skills = 2 hit kill). Then there is the oils and stones and such... some stones can imbue your swords with different effects for short periods of time, just apply before battle because he actually has to apply it. Same goes for oils, but the oils do different things, like making a target bleed more, causing more pain (causes the target to attack slower/move slower), and then theres the oils for different kinds of monsters. Like necrophage oil, causes more damage to ghosts. Insectoid oil, causes more damage to insect like monsters. And theres an oil that causes the blades to do more damage to dragons and such, the list goes on and that alone is complex.\nYou also have magic that you learn by visiting stones scattered about the world. They give you powers like Aard, which is like force push from SW or just a strong burst of wind. Theres 5 total I believe but I only ever used Aard because when you level it up you can knock down multiple targets or even if you want to just quickly move through an area and theres one monster/human blocking the path you can sometimes stun the target which leaves them open for an instant melee kill. I also forgot to mention above that, just like the instant kills, fighting in general is very quick and visceral. Lots of blood flies around, wounds will appear, sometimes heads will roll but its a very satisfying part of the game. Just as with the magic and melee, as you progress through the game and level up, you gain points in the form of tokens which varies as you get higer level. These tokens are bronze, silver and gold and the skills you can buy follow the same form of scale being bronze is basic and gold is the best.\nAs you progress through the game you will encounter tons of characters, often ones you can interact with. Some will give you missions, others will just say a few set things and continue about their business. As mentioned earlier, there is decision making opportunities that present themselves several times in the game and will always effect the game later down the road. So pick your decisions wisely and don't listen to the inner dialogue or other characters when they push you to pick a side... its totally possible (and apparently the prefered choice) to play the neutral part.\nThe game can get tedious though... as one could imagine from my intro, this is the third time I've played it and actually the first time of successfully completing it. There are a few dull parts in the game, which I liken to the Song of Ice and Fire series from Martin, if you're familiar with them... when its boring its really dull but when it gets good its so damn good! Try to break up the dull parts by doing monster contracts which you can find at the local taverns, right outside on the billboard. Each chapter usually has like 6 different contracts posted and they'll always fetch decent money. But as for the story, probably one of the best games I've played and I really look forward to the next chapter in the series as the ending is left pretty open no matter what ending you get (there are 3 different kinds). I highly recommend this game just go in with an open mind and try to remember to think things through if you're stuck or try different strategies, because thats what this game is all about.","April 6, 2015","true","73.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The usage of folklore to create an archaic kind of fantasy magic and monsters is something I only remember from Darklands (an ancient RPG in medieval Germany where all folklore and hexes were equally true). Nice interconnection of event, nice ambiguity in the choices. Graphics are dated but still able to convey the story and atmosphere very well.\n\nThe bad:\nI was finishing this to get my Witcher fix for Witcher 3 and the controls are jarring and some elements of the combat like stun chains (which can happen to you without anything to do about it) can be plain frustrating. The inventory is kind of a mess. Sometimes you run around the same areas the xth time and I'd really liked a fast travel because this world has none of the emergent stories a real open world RPG has. By today's standards the world tiles are really small and you still need tons of time to traverse them.\n\nThe ambigious:\nTo some the preset of the character Geralt (the main protagonist of the novels) might feel a bit limiting but it helps to create a deeper story as the character of Geralt is defined to a large degree. Themes are mature with excessive romance to the point of self parody but also a pretty dark world where none is 100% good.\n\nConclusion:\nThis is primarily a story driven game and I only played it for that. In that sense they could have thrown out plenty of the decisions (which do not have very deep impact on the story anyway) and it would still be interesting to see the relations of fleshed out characters and a well established world.\n\nI would recommend the story, but cannot blame anyone taking shortcuts on the gameplay.\n","May 10, 2015","true","13.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

My first impression was that the game had suppen frame-drops and clunky controls and did not like it at all in the beginning. However, it only took me about 2-3 hours to fall in love with this game.\n\nWhat I liked most about this game was the story. It was one of the reasons I got so addicted to the game. The clunky controls did not bother me, because the story was so interesting and unique. I also really liked the Level system. It had alot of variation, for example upgrading your magic skills, health, making your combat moves look smoother and even make Geralt do backflips!\n\nOne of the things most people hate the most is the combat. You click on the enemy and look at Geralt do some swings and wait until the sword (mouse pointer) have flames on it and then click again for a 2nd combo. I personally had no problem with this type of combat and actually enjoyed it a lot. But I understand why people dislike it, but it really depends on your style and what you like.\n\nThe biggest complains I have with this game is the clunky controls and sudden game crashes (which can be really annoying if you don't save the game often). But I've heard that the game auto-saves if you press f5, which I didn't know until after I finished the game and started on The Witcher 2.\n\nOverall, I think this a very good RPG game from an amazing franshise that I recommend for those who like dark, sexy and actionpacked RPGs, and  I therefore give this game a strong 8/10.","June 14, 2015","true","54.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

The story is extremely engrossing, and morality is handled in an organic way, there is no "good/evil points" system. The characters are all believable and interesting, and the game world feels alive with NPCs moving about. The game tells an engrossing story without dragging on for too long. My initial playthrough took around 40 hours, and I did a fair amount of side quests on my way through the game.\n\nThe parts of this game that some people might struggle with is the combat system and inventory management. Combat consists of selecting your sword (silver or steel) and combat style (heavy, fast, or group) and then clicking at the proper time to combo attacks on your enemies. I'm sure that some people will find this boring. (There are combat overhaul mods, but I did not use them, so I cannot vouch for how good/bad they are).\n\nInventory management is a chore in this game, but luckily there are not too many things that are vital to carry around. Also, quest items get their own inventory with unlimited space, and alchemical ingredients also get their own section.

After watching Angry Joe's video over the Witcher 2, I've been curious over this entire franchise for a while. Last Christmas, my parents got me several of the Witcher novels and my then girlfriend bought me one of the comics in trade. Since then I've loved the franchise, if just for the books alone.\n\nThis game however, while not as great as the books I've read thus far, is still great and show off the potential the developers have. I haven't played the other Witcher games yet but I'm excited to. While the combat, character models and English voice acting is wonky, the story, world and unique alchemy and daytime system really make this game work. Once you get into this game, you'll begin to trully roleplay as Geralt. You will fully understand why Geralt in the books is written the way he is and you as the player will sympathize with, or in my case agree with, his choices and world view.\n\nFor those wanting a unique and extremely different fantasy experience, look no further than the agressively, yet lovably, Polish Witcher.","November 26, 2015","true","51.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

So this provided the developers a strong and credible background to work with.\n\nMany RPGs have problems with World Building, this is creating a whole reality where the main lore is happening. But not this game, here you can find that the "background" lore is even more interesting than the main one. The amount of posible sequels and prequels based on that is huge. So it is very improbable that this franchise will become the next Assassins Creed (A clear example on weak World Building) or something like that.\n\nContraty to what many say, I loved the combat. You can read about its pros and cons all over the internet but I invite you to ignore all that and try it yourself for at least 3 hours.\nOf course I will do another playthrough with the Combat Rebalanced Mod soon, since it adds a layer of complexity.\n\nSpeaking of wich: PLAY THIS GAME ON HARD, NO MATTER HOW BAD YOU ARE FOR VIDEOGAMES, DO IT. Ignore the easy and medium settings. Hard is where this game shines. This gamemode forces you to utilize every element at your disposal and by that, increasing and improving the gameplay.\nYes, you will suffer killing the freaking Beast, and you will suffer at the swamp, but after that, the game becomes so easy, once you dominate the art of alchemy.\n\nAs for graphics, if you feel this game looks too old, there are mods that revamp all the textures and you can inject some DLLs to improve another graphical aspects.\n\nIf you are new to the franchise, play it on hard mode with vanilla combat and texture mods. After that I bet you will want to read the Witcher books before even starting to play the second game.\n\nBuy it no matter the price, it is worth it.","June 4","true","60.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

They changed it in the second part of the game "The Assasins of The King" but I still preffer the first part, it just gives you more open-world possibilities.\n\nThat's all from me.\nI love this game, go ♥♥♥♥ing buy it! :)\n\n9.5/10","June 25, 2014","true","76.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Боевая система оказалась на удивление оригинальной. Да и вообще вся анимация боев заслуживает исключительно лестных отзывов. Стоит заметить, что в повседневной деятельности Геральт активно использует два меча (стальной – против людей, серебряный – против чудовищ) и три боевых стиля, открывающие в сочетании с пятью магическими знаками огромный простор тактических возможностей. Все ведьмачьи атрибуты, стили и магические знаки разделены на пять витков развития, каждый из которых связан с сопряженными способностями. Три вида талантов (бронзовые, серебряные и золотые) не позволят игроку прокачать что-то одно и навсегда забыть об остальном – хочешь не хочешь, а основы выучить придется. Радует любовь разработчиков к деталям: все без исключения, даже самые ненужные персонажи, кажутся такими же живыми, как и сам Геральт, а города напоминают огромные муравейники, где постоянно что-то происходит. После первого прохождения хочется изучить "Ведьмака" еще раз, принять другие решения и посмотреть, чем все закончится на этот раз.\nИтог: увлекательный сюжет, отличная атмосфера, оригинальная боевая система, превосходная графика (на момент выхода игры) и саундтрек.","October 21, 2015","true","50.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I still can't believe that CD Projekt Red pulled all of this off with a heavily modified Aurora engine, which goes all the way back to 2002's Neverwinter Nights. Though the combat can feel strange and jittery at some points, the overall gameplay is very fun and the storyline is extremely well-crafted. An impressive selection of choices and consequences make this worth a few replays as well to take Geralt on a different path. To me, this game along with its sequel both play more like action/adventure titles with RPG elements rather than pure RPGs, but they do it extremely well.

Eventually you get used to the combat and it starts improving as you unlock new skills and weapons, the main storyline still feels pretty irrelevant but there's a huge amount of side content to keep you busy.

This game does it's story better than most recent games I have played. The characters are extremely likeable and the voice acting is pretty good for the most part.\n\nThe game itself looks very nice visually, true it isn't the best graphics but it looks extremely well done given it's age.\n\nThe combat is a bit limited, however, this doesn't make it any less fun. While you are limited to the three fighting styles there are ways to string together combos and use magic too. The game cleverly forces you to use strategy in your fights which also mixes things up a bit. If you're expecting to hack and slash your way through I suggest you play on easy. If you try that on normal or hard you'll find yourself face down in the dirt.\n\nFinding things is extremely easy as you can mark each quest or item you're trying to find on your map. A mini map in the top corner constantly points you in the right direction too.\n\nI'm pleasantly surprised so far....... and i expect to be pleasantly surprised some more as I play through this story.\n\nI definately recommend this game to everyone, the history and lore behind the game alone is so expansive, it's as if this whole other world actually exists.\n\nPick it up, give it a try, become intregued and emotionally involved in Geralts story. You wont regret it.","May 20","true","8.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

Based on the book series of the same name written by Andrzej Sapkowski, the game works to expand on the mythology of the character.\n\nThe question always rides in "is it worth playing The Witcher 1 to play The Witcher 2 or 3?" While not necessary to enjoy the later installments, it will greatly enhance your gaming experience as you will be savvy to the lore that precedes Assassins of Kings and The Wild Hunt.\n\nThe Game\nNow on to the game itself; it is long. It can be "rushed" but that does not entail a quick romp through what the game has to offer. There's preparation involved, just like a real Witcher, and using the game's multitude of mechanics is imperative to success in the game. While this can make for a frustrating experience, it also makes it doubly rewarding. The exhaustive use of oils, bombs and alchemy will serve to make you more capable in taking on the many enemies, monsters and specters you will encounter.\n\nThe game itself, for being a bit older, has held up well in terms of narrative and by extension, voice acting and the like. Graphics are notably dated, but don't detract from the overall experience, and sometimes even add to the atmosphere. The most damaging aspect of this game is its combat which can be chalked up to timed clicking. It can be very frustrating and sometimes completely unresponsive. Understandably, this may turn some players away, but it should not completely ruin the game experience. It might cause some ragequits and make you think this game is a pile of rubbish, but when you finally get past that horrendous Zeugl or Wraith or Grandma, the satisfaction is unparalleled.\n\nTo also emphasize the most drawing aspect of the game, the use of "choice" is very well executed in The Witcher. Your words and actions have real consequences and truly shape your game. This type of storytelling is seen from time to time, but not always done as well as The Witcher has managed. The ability to see the effect Geralt has on the world of the Witcher is truly worth playing the game, if only for that very reason.\n\nThe Cons\nUnfortunately, the game suffers from some poor design choices and very long and very dull sections that can hinder the narrative's momentum (and your interest). Chapters II, and by extension, III are the breaking points of the game -- if you can get past them, you'll get to the real meat of the game and it will become far more enjoyable and better paced. The Temple Quarter and Swamps also present poor environmental design which demand a lot of running around and ridiculous barricades that only serve to slow your progress. This ultimately adds unnecessary length to the game and can become fairly boring and repetitive quickly.\n\nHowever, the game's relative length is entirely up to the player. If you desire to experience all the game has to offer, you're in for a long haul, topping 60+ hours, easily. A casual playthrough, with some side quests and exploration will clock in at 30+/- hours, and I'm sure if you really rush it, you could get away with 15-20+/- hours.\n\nSummary\nThe Witcher is a fantastic narrative experience that while sometimes very lengthy, demands you immerse yourself fully in its lore and atmosphere to enjoy it completely, and once done, is a truly amazing experience. Its dated gameplay could see some players walking away, but if you can push through some of the more mundane parts and questionable design elements, the game is very rewarding.\n\nWhile it is not the best of games and not a prerequisite to playing The Witcher 2 & 3, it is wholly worth experiencing. And at its current price, you could do far worse.\n\nIMPORTANT HOT TIP FOR 500 ORENS\nSave often. It'll save your hide more than you can imagine.","February 28","true","34.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","1"

Well, actually, it started in the books, but still. A nice journey into the trilogy before "The Wild Hunt" and even, on my second playthrough, I still enjoyed it.\n\nWitcher 1 offers a detailed and interesting story with some funny dialogues, as well as marvelous maps with quite beautiful graphics for 2008. Such combination definitely provides a fascinating and involving medieval fantasy atmosphere to the players, which, I guess, is one of the main reasons people love the trilogy so much. The other, probably, is sex. Witcher 1 stands out from the other parts with special romance cards thay you get for sexual encounters... and Triss Merigold is as charming as ever.\n\nI appreciate that the developers bring dark and mature themes to the game and that they weren't concerned about political correctness. There are number of things, for which feminists would call the developers sexists. But, since I'm not a feminist, kudos for CD Projekt Red, because I prefer my games uncensored.\n\nWith that said, there are number of things, that make the gameplay less pleasant, namely:\n\n1) Frequent crashes, freezing and black screens (I played it on Windows 10)\n2) Despite the cool combos, the combat system is dull and gets boring soon. Fighting is not about the skill, as much as it is about damage stats and choosing the right stance and weapon\n3) There are too many monsters around and they respawn too often. It doesn't make the game more difficult, just artificially longer, as you need time to deal with them. You can run pass them, but still.\n4) Inventory is too small. There is a mod for that, but it doesn't provide more slots, it just allows to stack more items of the same type\n5) The game offers choices that have consequences, leading to alternative scenarios, but none of those consequences are sufficiently serious as it was in Mass Effect. Almost nothing you did has any relevant effect in Witcher 2.\n\nAlso:\n\n6) The "mature" element of this game is mostly sex, profanity and morally grey choices, which all is fine by me, but I wish the story was more sophisticated. Come to think of it, the main storyline is actually quite robust and behind those primitive fetch quests there aren't that many side quests that stand out.\n\nBut even with those faults Witcher is one of my favourite games. I had great fun playing it and with the extra content (a digital comic and fan made adventure modules) I had some more. "Witchmas" adventure is very funny! "Price of Neutrality" and "Side Effects" were nice, too. The other modules were interesting, but they have some gamebreaking bugs.\n\nThe game has plenty of mods and a game editor to create your own modules, so that's another good thing about it.\n\nMy overall rating 8/10.","March 20","true","140.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The plot twists, the all-the-same-NPCs, their realistic quotes, the books and the info you could get from them to learn more about the Witcher's world, the side quests, the witcher contracts that made me feel like a real witcher though were boring and poorly paid, ALL OF IT was completely worth and enjoyable and I do not regret playing it.

Not only is it a fully compelling story, the characters are well-developed and fleshed-out throughout. The gameplay is remiscent of Dragon Age-meets-rhythm-game, but it works incredibly well.

I suggest playing it before going at The Witcher 2 so you have an idea of whats going on, plus it will make The Witcher two more enjoyable.\n\nThe Witcher is a great RPG with anywhere from 50-80 hours of gameplay depending on how you want to take it along with choices to make that effect the story down the road and the game doesn't hold your hand. Minus chapters 2 and 3 (due to their watered down quests that seem to go on forever and the boring environments) out of 5 chapters along with a Prologue and a Epilogue the game is pretty fun and entertaining.\n\nCombat in the game turns off a lot of people right off the bat, I say give it a chance because once you get used to it you'll feel more intune to the way it works and you possibly may even enjoy it. For those who want to take on the hard difficulty, prepare to possibly rage due to a few boss fights and a few other silly encounters that are just plain unfair, unfourtunatly.\n\nThe voice acting in the game is decent but often times laughable and the animations minus some of the combat animations are just plain silly. Character models are reused frequently as well throughout the game which was just plain lazy. All in all I'd say pick this one up even if its for a quick runthrough if you are planning on playing The Witcher 2 and 3.","December 6, 2013","true","77.9"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","1"

Now today it happened again, except this time windows got corrupted and rendered my hdd useless without a reformat. So my review is only based on the 8 hours I managed to squeeze out of the game. The graphics are okay (game is rather old) The combat system is so weird. It took a couple of hours before I understood exactly how to use it.

The atmosphere resembles the dark middle ages, where poverty, war and disease has struck down on the denizens of this world.\n\nYou are Geralt of Rivia, a Witcher who is both respected and despised for his line of work. Your profession is to dispose of creatures of the dark, demons and foul creatures by means of spell, sword and alchemy.\nHowever, in the beginning of the game you are struck by amnesia and thus your past is unknown to you. This is a central plot in the game, as you will carve your own destiney in the god-forsaken universe of the Witcher. Choosing between right and wrong is difficult, if not impossible, as every decision you make will depend on your own moral code. There are no heroes, no real villains, as everyone is fighting for themselves and characters are thus "grey" - they all contain classically noble character traits and "evil" traits. Consequently, the demons you are sent to kill can appear more humane than the village priest who would rather have you kill seemingly innocent people.\n\nThe game is highly recommendable, despite its now outdated graphics. The quality of the game experience is enjoyable, and several replays is almost inevitable if you want to know what would have happened if you just had sided with the other faction.. or none at all.","April 20, 2014","true","47.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/peterhollo/recommended/20900/","peterhollo","CorvusCorax","http://steamcommunity.com/id/peterhollo/","533 products in account","A unique role-playing game that is a rarity these days. Developed by a Polish company and is based on the book with the same title written by a Polish author called Andrzej Sapkowski. You play as Geralt, a mutant hunter who is specialised in fighting and slaying monsters. At the beginning of Geralt's story he does not remember much - he's found unconscious and is taken to the witchers' hideout. The establishment, then, is attacked by a group of bandits known as the Salamander - although defending the castle is a success, the witchers are unable to stop the bandits from stealing their precious mutagens. Geralt and his fellow witchers, therefore, set out to find where the gang is hiding and of course to take back what is rightfully theirs.\n\nSome notable elements that characterises Witcher and makes it different from other RPGs:\n\n--- Controlling Geralt is very easy. The game offers you several camera perspectives, in fact, even the input device can be changed: focus can be on the mouse solely or you can use the combination of the keyboard and mouse - whichever is your preference.\n\n--- During combat timing is very important. The game being hack-and-slash requires you to hit enemies several times. This, Geralt does automatically, but following the hit of his blade you can have a follow-up click with your mouse - if your timing is perfect Geralt does make a follow-up cut which is stronger and deadlier. In addition to this the game employs 3 combat styles. Larger enemies require the strong style: Geralt carefully times each hit and while they are slower they result in a heavier slash. Faster enemies simply avoid your attacks but changing to the fast style enables you to hit them. And if your are surrounded you need to use the group style.\n\n--- Beside the styles and the timing you should be careful with the material your weapon is made of. While steel-made swords are perfect against human beings and some of the monsters you encounter there are many supernatural beings in the Witcher's world you can only wound with a silver-made sword.\n\nAnd here come those that made me like the game a lot:\n\n--- Choices: Yes, yes, this is common. You decide to help or you simply let people die. Right? No! Witcher does not indicate what will happen once a decision is made. Unlike Mass Effect, here there are no indicators and nobody tells you whether it is good or bad what you'll attempt to do. In certain cases both decisions you can make will result in the death of someone - you need to decide which is "better" or you simply need to pick A) so that in your next playthrough you can go with option B.\n\n--- Alchemy: A very important part of the game! There are severals types of plants / herbs out there you need to collect. You can then use these at fireplaces to create potions that either make you stronger or grant you an extra ability (e.g. seeing in dark places). Interestingly, all of these poison Geralt to a certain degree - your toxicity level increases and eventually you need to rest or drink another potion that neutralises the adverse effect of these drinks. The more scrolls you find the more potions are available - you can also experiment if you have the time.\n\nIt should be noted that Geralt is mainly a warrior. You have some spells called signs but they are nothing special. So, in your next playthrough you cannot have a significantly different build - you can experiment, for sure, but the value lies in Witcher's world. And this world is huge. I like how the game starts filling up your Glossary - a menu similar to the codex in the Dragon Ages series containing all kinds of entries explaining the world to the gamer. Also, while fistfighting is rather easy and boring the drinking and dice-poker mini games are excellent and make the game quite funny!\n\nI finished the game in 50+ hours and pretty much completed everything I could. I read the game's wikia pages parallelly and found that I'd missed some missions and if I remember correctly the game has at least 2 endings. So there you go: over 100 hours and this is only for 8 bucks! In addition to this, it comes in the form of a so-called Enhanced Edition that offers a lot of extras such as making-of videos and other campaigns. Plus, the game looks quite good for being released in 2007!\n\nOverall, Witcher is a unique RPG. If you are fan of the genre and finished multiple playthroughs in Dragon Age then do head for the store page as this game must be in your basket!","May 2, 2014","true","52.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerev4r/recommended/20900/","nerev4r","255 2 Golds of Penetration","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerev4r/","80 products in account","I never planned to play this game, I watched a full playthrough and planned to start with W2. However this game was on sale for $2, so I bought both this and Witcher 2. Now I'm really glad I didn't skip this game because it's amazing.\n\nNow despite what everyone says, I personally don't think the combat's that bad. At first its really awkward and surprisingly easy but as you progress it does get more difficult and it does get more complex, especially once you start unlocking witcher signs. Basically, you click on an enemy to attack, and then the cursor on-screen turns into a flaming sword, you click. It's like a rhythm, and each style of fight (strong, fast, and group) requires a different "rhythm" that you will eventually memorize. Overall controls are a bit odd, you can go either isometric or an over-the-shoulder camera, which the game refers to as OTS. OTS is by far the best way to play the game in my opinion and is easier for me, however OTS controls resemble a first person game like Skyrim, if you want to turn around you're going to have to move your mouse all the way around like you would in a first person game. You can switch between camera modes at any time and are free to use whatever you see fit for a situation, although I always use OTS and have never felt the need to switch to isometric.\n\nThe combat might be annoying and boring to some but where this game really shines is with story and character. If you haven't read the books this game introduces all of the characters very well. I believe the games take on a brand new storyline that's not in the books but I wouldn't swear to it, so if you want the "full" Witcher experience you'll have to read the books as well. The story is well executed and the characters are absolutely amazing, every side character feels unique and like an individual. Geralt (the protagonist of our story) seems a little bland compared to all of these amazing characters but given he's a witcher it makes sense. Luckily though, Geralt has personality and a sense of humor and that completely makes up for his overly monotone voice. The game also forces you to make a LOT of decisions, that impact the storyline a lot, I think this game does it better than even Mass Effect. Sometimes it pays off to do some extra digging, if you rush through a certain mission you might realize you've screwed up.\n\nGraphically the game isn't anything special. It reminds me a LOT of Guild Wars 2 although I think it's the loading screens that make me feel this way. You don't need a powerful rig to run this game, but despite its dated look the game still looks pretty.\n\nThere's also a lot to do in the game besides the main storyline. There are sidequests, and "jobs" you can find on notice boards that usually consist of killing enemies, bringing back a certain amount of their drops and giving them to the client to earn orens, which are this game's currency. Aside from this there are minigames too, such as fist fighting, dice poker, etc. These minigames are fun but you won't earn a lot of money by playing them, unless you repeatedly play something like fist fighting over and over and over which isn't really all that fun. This game doesn't hold your hand either, you can set waypoints for missions but those only appear on your map, the structure feels a lot like Morrowind except it's not as barebones. If you liked the way Morrowind played then you could play this game the exact same way, you have to use your journal and "tracking" quests (adding waypoints) is entirely optional. Oh, I should mention the sex cards. You get literal cards for banging people.\n\nOf course, the game is buggy. I noticed a weird mouse issue where my mouse would completely stop working but this seemed to be caused by using the Steam overlay. I've had a crash or two as well and Geralt likes to get stuck on things. There's also times where it looks like Geralt will go to push someone out of the way but instead he walks to the side of them and gets stuck and the only way to fix this is to either fidget into oblivion or wait for the NPC to move. These however are minor issues and don't take away from the game overall.\n\nThis game is absolutely amazing, if you can get past its debatable combat system you have yourself a very enjoyable RPG.","June 20, 2014","true","35.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Then of course a week later it was on sale.\n\nNow finally on with the game, The Witcher is a fantasy RPG based on a series of Polish novels I haven't read yet. You play as Geralt, a lady's-man-warrior-witch-bloke, and embark on an epic quest, meeting friends and foes, bandits, possessed children, fiery dogs, mad scientists, squids, gremlins, floating naked chicks and frog mages. The usual.\n\nYou level up your guy, get upgrades and make potions, as you do. The combat system is good, switching between swords and speeds. It's gritty, with gore and swearing and sex. Reminds me of Game of Thrones, for Eastern European jews or something.\n\nIt's a great medieval yarn. It just repeats the same characters over and over.

The story is dark and complex, the characters are interesting and vary widely in personality, and from start until finish you are confronted with decisions which rarely have a clear "right" choice. Does the game end if you make the wrong choice? Does it force you to restart? No, life goes on, some gain from your decision and some suffer.\n\nTo be honest, the weight of the game sometimes made me avoid it, but any time I started playing it I would quickly be drawn in. The atmosphere is excellently crafted, the environments and monsters are unique and interesting, and there's a fair deal of lore provided for both. The graphics were impressive for a game of this age, particularly the humans/faces.\n\nI've seen some people complain about the combat, but I actually enjoyed it. The timing-based combo system meant that every battle was involved, and then throw in the different stances + sword types and on top of all that the magic/signs, the combat was quite interesting and never stale.\n\nHighly recommend it to those who are tired of all the same cookie-cutter RPGs.","August 14, 2014","true","73.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This game has gathered some attention for some of the adult-themes in it, and while running around carousing is mildly amusing at first, it is the gameplay and the story that win out in the end.  After spending around 800 hours between Oblivion and Fallout 3, exploring every nook and cranny of those games, I just couldn't get into New Vegas and haven't bothered with Skyrim because they just seem like more of the same.  While I would have thought that to be a good thing, I think personally my RPG cravings were just ready to be immersed in something new.  Enter The Witcher:\n\nWhile you don't get to choose a character or class in this game, the main character has his own qualities and abilities that make it unique.  The story in this game is compelling and there is a lot of entertaining detective work to do and choices you have to make to keep the game advancing. The characters have more depth than most games, quite possibly due to this being based on a novel—a medium where if the character development is lacking,...it just plain sucks.  For example, Geralt of Rivia, the main character, has a personality that is mostly  polite, cordial, and heroic at times, but depending on who he's talking to there is a sarcastic, snarky side, as well as a naughty side.  Rarely are characters in games given this much dimension.\n\nBy today's standards, the combat system is seems antiquated, but after you get used to it, it's fine.  It does the job and makes getting contracts to slay monsters for gold a fun and worthwhile profession.  The item pickups are not plentiful, and if you want a new weapon every 10 minutes, this isn't your game.  Honestly though, I found this aspect of it kind of refreshing, the upgrades seem well deserved and its kind of nice to not have to learn to use a new toy or ability every few minutes or keep looking at weapon specs all day trying to figure out which is better,...this way you can just keep playing. The alchemy on the other hand is one of the deeper aspects of the game, and it becomes a fun hobby as the game progresses.\n\nMy biggest gripes about this game, which are few, are how I was robbed of some of the mission completions.  For example, I escort an NPC to safety,...end of mission cutscene ensues, ...story to be continued later, but then the NPC randomly gets killed instead of being safely immune from danger,...and then there is no continuation on that plot because the NPC has perished.  Maybe I'm just too picky. This game reinforces the tried and true RPG mantra: save frequently, and make multiple saves.","June 28, 2014","true","88.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The story is fairly enjoyable, but the pacing and execution leaves much to be desired. Game mechanics-wise, the Witcher is a game riddled with bugs. I only regret not recording some of them, as they were incredibly amusing. The graphics are fairly good for their time, and improved upon more in the enhanced edition of the game. The art direction is pretty solid, and the music presentation is above average. If you can find the courage to take this game on despite its glaring flaws, it's worth a play. If not, I'd recommend a summary or a Let's Play series somewhere on YouTube to watch instead. That said, I'm still going to finish this game and prepare myself for the Witcher 2, which I've heard is infinitely better. 6/10","July 11, 2014","true","44.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This game has gathered some attention for some of the adult-themes in it, and while running around carousing is mildly amusing at first, it is the gameplay and the story that win out in the end.  After spending around 800 hours between Oblivion and Fallout 3, exploring every nook and cranny of those games, I just couldn't get into New Vegas and haven't bothered with Skyrim because they just seem like more of the same.  While I would have thought that to be a good thing, I think personally my RPG cravings were just ready to be immersed in something new.  Enter The Witcher:\n\nWhile you don't get to choose a character or class in this game, the main character has his own qualities and abilities that make it unique.  The story in this game is compelling and there is a lot of entertaining detective work to do and choices you have to make to keep the game advancing. The characters have more depth than most games, quite possibly due to this being based on a novel—a medium where if the character development is lacking,...it just plain sucks.  For example, Geralt of Rivia, the main character, has a personality that is mostly  polite, cordial, and heroic at times, but depending on who he's talking to there is a sarcastic, snarky side, as well as a naughty side.  Rarely are characters in games given this much dimension.\n\nBy today's standards, the combat system is seems antiquated, but after you get used to it, it's fine.  It does the job and makes getting contracts to slay monsters for gold a fun and worthwhile profession.  The item pickups are not plentiful, and if you want a new weapon every 10 minutes, this isn't your game.  Honestly though, I found this aspect of it kind of refreshing, the upgrades seem well deserved and its kind of nice to not have to learn to use a new toy or ability every few minutes or keep looking at weapon specs all day trying to figure out which is better,...this way you can just keep playing. The alchemy on the other hand is one of the deeper aspects of the game, and it becomes a fun hobby as the game progresses.\n\nMy biggest gripes about this game, which are few, are how I was robbed of some of the mission completions.  For example, I escort an NPC to safety,...end of mission cutscene ensues, ...story to be continued later, but then the NPC randomly gets killed instead of being safely immune from danger,...and then there is no continuation on that plot because the NPC has perished.  Maybe I'm just too picky. This game reinforces the tried and true RPG mantra: save frequently, and make multiple saves.","June 28, 2014","true","88.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Later I purchased another copy on Steam, thinking I could play through it again then, but I didn't... Then I got it for free on gog.com as a bonus to another purchase, so my third copy in fact. And third time's a charm, right? Right. I started playing then, finally. Got all the way to the Chapter IV... and stopped... for nearly a year!

Aside from the imbalanced difficulty curve, I found myself barely fighting monsters apart from grinding. There's too much running errands, talking to people and running back and forth required in the story, and not nearly enough being a witcher. Although I felt the gameplay was a little stale, the biggest redeamer is the story. I really liked it!

If that turns you off I wouldn't recommend this game.\n\nThe combat is more repetitive than most games, but tolerable.\n\nThe game fails to give tutorials on how some mechanics/controls works. For instance: You hold down shift to see your mouse cursor to click on your signs. There I just saved you 5 minutes of google searching.\n\nThe dialog is really bad in the first chapter, but significantly raises in quality after that.\n\nClosing Thoughts: If you like RPG's that are character driven this is the game for you.

Although the graphics are outdated, and some npc's models recycled, the atmosphere is flawless, you can feel like you are Geralt. It has a good replay value, as there are 3 possible endings, which are determined by your choices, some of those, are made way before you see the consecuences, making you feel like an a**hole because of what you have done.\n\nTL,DR:\n\n+: 30+hrs of fun, nice graphics, immersive world and story, nice replay value\n- : combat mechanics and some npc's recycled models. character animations are, sometimes, bad","June 21, 2015","true","83.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Some unique elements that are mildly annoying, but add to realism/immersion. Morally grey decisions that cause game-lasting changes to various elements. 8.5/10\n\nGreat action RPG with some unique elements that separate it from the rest of it's genre. On the hard difficulty with the Extreme Immersion mod installed (which removes much of the HUD and other elements that make things feel more game-y), it presented a good challenge that never got too frustrating.\n\nThe combat system is a bit weird, but not bad once you get used to it. Instead of 1 click per attack, you click once and Geralt launched into a combo. Then you click again at the end of the combo to begin the next flurry. Proper timing leads to much better (and cooler looking) attacks.\n\nItems/potions that restore chunks of health instantly are rare (I know of one). Instead, everything just makes your natural health regen faster. A bit annoying at times, but it does add a bit more realism to the game.\n\nYou can't gather alchemy ingredients if you don't know they exist. Again, a bit annoying, but adds realism. If you didn't know that a dog's liver was good for making potions, why would you ever take it out, right?\n\nFinally, this is one of those RPGs that forces you to make various moral decisions (many of which will affect the later chapters in the game significantly, so choose wisely). However, unlike many games which hvae clear "good" and "bad" choices, Witcher almost always makes you choose between two equally bad options. For example (spoilers incoming), at one point you decide whether to support a village whose leaders are murderers, rapists, and child traffickers or to support the witch they are trying to lynch, who aided many of those same leaders herself. Both are clearly in the wrong, but you must decide which to kill and which to save. That decision will affect various things for the remainder of the game (my advice: save the witch).","June 23, 2014","true","72.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The story is, in my opinion, highly original, with a monster slayer trying to cope with a changing world in which man can be a greater danger than beast.

The second complaint is a very minor complaint and partially is my fault for I have a short attention span.

The CRPG elements (item hoarding, inventory management, skill upgrades, etc) are very classic in nature - which is a hate-it or love-it affair. Likewise the presentation is something players will either hate or love - being a Central European RPG the story begins in medias res, there is a ton of dialogue, and the supporting characters are mostly ordinary folk with fairly rich back stories (as opposed to typical JRPGs which start "at the beginning" of a story, include minimal dialogue, and include flashy but hollow characters).

The game provides you the story of Geralt of Rivia, the beast slayer, deep into the medieval dark fantasy, discover the Salamander plan, conflict between species. Every moments and quest plots are really polished and reasonable decisions. With strong and complex RPG elements and point-and-click combat style (Combat styles, parry, dodge, signs, and alchemy), it reminded your old school feeling and very enjoyable. As enhanced edition, most of scripts and plots are rearranged to be more outstanding. In addition, the soundtracks are really great and well-fit.\nThe clipping issue during combat which cause Garalt's animation to be delayed and some glitch of inventory and quest tracker annoy me a little.

Even on easy the game was pretty challenging in parts, but not really due to the difficulty, but due to the very clunky combat system. I felt like I was fighting Geralt's glitchy moves more than I was the monsters at times. However, the game as a whole is pretty good. It's a decently long game and there's a bunch of quests. There's a bit too much backtracking for my tastes, particularly in Chapters 2 and 4 and the quests at times can feel arbitrary (go to person A, find person B, find out person B is dead and then have to talk to A. Go find person C so they can give you xp and orens). I can really only recommend this game if you really don't wanna feel left out for some of the characters in The Witcher 2 and you want to transfer your save file over to the 2nd game a la Mass Effect style. If the game's combat really turns you off that much, I'd honestly just find a wiki summary of the story and read that, though you'd be missing out on the pretty good character interaction.\n\nTL;DR: The game is clunky and feels very dated, but the main story is really enthralling and worth the trip if you care about the lore enough.","August 15, 2014","true","28.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Some of the translation to English results in odd conversations, some sections (mainly the swamp) are a bit of a grind, the combat can be repetitive and I had the occasional crash.  There are also some upgrades, signs and potions that are much more useful than others.\n\nAt times, too, it wasn't particularly clear about why you were doing what you were doing, or which speech option would get you which result.  But that's part of what makes The Witcher rewarding to play - it doesn't always hold your hand or telegraph every step in the plot.  The story is engrossing and, translation aside, the characters are great (even though most of the 'romances' are just Geralt saying "let's bang, ok?") and you will quickly realise that you can't please everyone.  There are definitely a few tough choices to make.\n\nThe game takes a while to warm up so don't be put off by the slow start.  Also, if you're finding it difficult and dying a lot then - like me, initially - you're doing it wrong.  There are always potions, blade coatings, signs or upgrades that make beating particular enemies (and the game) much easier.  When in doubt: Swallow.\n\nWhile The Witcher lacks some of the polish (not Polish) of its AAA RPG cousins, it more than makes up for it in the depth of story and the adult RPG elements.  Highly recommended for anyone who wants to lose themselves in a game.","May 23, 2014","true","73.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Later I purchased another copy on Steam, thinking I could play through it again then, but I didn't... Then I got it for free on gog.com as a bonus to another purchase, so my third copy in fact.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dowlphin/recommended/20900/","dowlphin","Dandowlion","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dowlphin/","265 products in account","It is probably helpful for the reader if I compare The Witcher to Skyrim:\n\nWhile Skyrim 'feels' like a computer game, a role playing game, and maybe could be described as having a slight theatrical vibe, playing The Witcher feels like reading a good book. It is very character- and story-focused. Geralt of Rivia is a very down-to-earth and likeable character and the game doesn't try to glorify or overly dramatize things. Those subtleties make the game feel even more believable and realistic than the medieval setting already does.\nI was worried that because of this, the game might be overly gruesome, but it's not. It has a certain charme.\n\nI actually like that the game world is relatively limited and that you revisit places a lot, which change every now and then. It gives the whole setting more depth. I also can more easily relate to the various quests, see them as part of a whole. At times the game makes it difficult to stop, because, as I said, it's like reading a good book where you're always at some interesting point.\n\nThe combat isn't overly detailed, which makes it more fun to play around with the various combat stances and alchemical helpers and just watch and enjoy the action. I also like the very limited selection of weapons and armor. It would just be unnecessary complication. I personally don't like stuff that much, and the alchemy is still tolerable to me, because when you play on medium difficulty, you don't have to dive deep into that. A few potions here and there and it'll be fine.\n\nI like very much how the game doesn't put too much time pressure on you. Many of the temporarily active helpers are long-lasting (e.g. a blade sharpening that lasts a full day of in-game time), and the in-game time progresses slowly enough that you don't end up hurrying around before the 'wrong time of day' sets in.\n\nIt's easy for me to overlook the various small flaws of the game. They're not too immersion-breaking, and the UI has some minor complications that aren't too bothersome. (Among the things that bother me most is that in some free range areas there are artificial fences, requiring you to walk all the way around. But it's just a minor inconvenience.)\n\nThe decisions you make in various situations don't feel like dummies that pretend to have an effect, but there are (some) consequences, so you actually feel like playing a role.\nI sometimes would have wished for more flexibility in dialogues when decision-making is involved, but again: Not a big deal.\n\nThe Witcher is just so different from that 'typical game experience'. A very good translation of a book series to a computer game. Again... It's almost as if you're 'playing a novel', but totally not like an interactive novel, and also not like those modern games that linearly push you from scene to scene, but a proper, mature computer game with focus on story and character interaction. You're wandering around in a story.\n\nIn fact, what makes this game great reminds me a bit of the Half-Life series, but with less action and less linearity. At least the first game was based on the work of a real horror story author.\n\n\nSpecific things that bothered me significantly:\n- No access to storage in chapter 5 - you have to work with what you have and can't restock from your storage. Even worse, at the beginning of the chapter you are allowed access, but shortly after, you are barred from it.\n- Voice dialogues contain many instances of wrong emphasis due to the VA not knowing the context of the line.\n- Geralt keeps sheathing his weapon after a few seconds against my intention to not do that.\n- Drawing the sword (except in strong stance) makes Geralt move faster, so basically for fast travel always draw your sword. I wish there was a better way to travel quickly than this obvious workaround.\n- Fist fight is very weird. There are skills for various moves, but not enough tutorial to explain how they work, so my fist fighting ended up very simplistic. Situation-dependent combos rarely ever worked properly.\n\n- Geralt of Review","March 30, 2014","true","49.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Aside from that a very enjoyable RPG.","December 29, 2013","true","54.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This has become my new favorite adventure story that I can't stop telling my friends about, and I thinking about learning Polish just to read the books.\n\nThis is a very expansive universe with in-depth gaming mechanics that will take you a while to understand and master (look up the wiki for the game, it will help so much, but be sure to tread carefully as it is full of spoilers: http://witcher.wikia.com/wiki/Witcher_Wiki) It is not a perfected game, as there are limitations to combat and exploring, and dated graphics. Most of these inequities however, you will find ot be endearing rather than frustrating and while play the sequel, you will probably develop nostalgia. On that note, the sequel expands upon almost everything from the first, although it borrows heavily from the mechanics of the first. I'd highly reccomend beating the first before moving on. This way you can jump into #2 seamlessly and feel right at home. Additionally, the first game has tons of morally decisions to make, and tons of loot to find, some of which you can import into the second game!\n\nThis game has a very interesting medieval setting, and the coolest things about the story are the contemporary themes! You have 'terrorist' elves taking hostages in a bank holdup, there are 'special forces' units in service to the crown, everywhere you go people are making rascist remarks and commiting hate crimes, you see 'the church' showing its true evil, and overheard jokes about 'drinking and riding'.\n\nThis seem to me to be very much a game meant for dudes, for you are medieval badass that slays bandits, monsters, and women alike. It is not a sexist game, there are many women kicking ♥♥♥ here too, but it can come off that way as have the choice to conquer nearly everyone of them. The 'romance' in here isn't great, some of the 'romance cards' are kinda cute, others downright disturbing, but all in all the sequel does a much better job with romance scenes.\n\nBreakdown\n\nPros:\n-Original Medieval Fantasy story/setting\n-Great soundtrack\n-Mulit-dimensioned combat mechanics\n-Lots of exploration\n-Good loot\n-Lots of characters\n-Choices affect the story\n-High replay ability\n-Hours of gameplay, but not required!\n-Mod compatible\n-Importing save to the sequel\n-Very detailed wiki site and fan base\n\nCons:\n-Minimal control over swordplay\n-Poor combat movement\n-Invisible exploration barriers (like KOTOR)\n-Graphics do not look like the official screen shots\n-Awkward and unexpected story ending (don't worry there's a sequel now)","February 1, 2015","true","98.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The main things that annoyed me is, obviously the combat. It is boring, tedious and doesn't seem very inspired, just click, wait for the mouse cursor to change and click some more, this makes the monster contracts somewhat of a chore instead of "Oh boy! A new creature to slay!" At least for me. Probably not a complaint you'll hear often, but I found the dialogue to be at times very strange, and the characters animations while talking can sometimes be very distracting.\n\nNow for some positive things about it; The story is very well done, same with the characters. It's got a dynamic weather system if you're into that type of thing, although for me, it seemed to always rain! Made it a drag sometimes, ha. I really enjoyed the poker dice game, probably a couple hours from that alone. I'd say if you're into RPG's The Witcher is something you should at least give a chance, I know I'm glad I did.","June 30, 2015","true","39.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I came off of much better 3rd person action  games and attempted Gothic, which is horrible. I have since powered through the witcher. My advice is to read the tutorials, which I didnt the first time, and pick a style of controls that works best for you. the Story is great and the multiple aspects that are based on your decisions weave a story that is unique to your play through. The rpg aspects, like leveling and quests are well done. The level design needs some work but it doesnt destract from the game enough.\n\nThis is not a game to be missed. 8/10\n\nPS. would be higher if the controls were more action and less RPG. the point and clicky random roll the dice hit point RPG system pulls you out of being the character. it gives a disjointed puppeteer feel to the character preventing you from relating to the actions that make in the game.","November 19, 2011","true","57.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Even on easy the game was pretty challenging in parts, but not really due to the difficulty, but due to the very clunky combat system. I felt like I was fighting Geralt's glitchy moves more than I was the monsters at times. However, the game as a whole is pretty good. It's a decently long game and there's a bunch of quests. There's a bit too much backtracking for my tastes, particularly in Chapters 2 and 4 and the quests at times can feel arbitrary (go to person A, find person B, find out person B is dead and then have to talk to A. Go find person C so they can give you xp and orens). I can really only recommend this game if you really don't wanna feel left out for some of the characters in The Witcher 2 and you want to transfer your save file over to the 2nd game a la Mass Effect style. If the game's combat really turns you off that much, I'd honestly just find a wiki summary of the story and read that, though you'd be missing out on the pretty good character interaction.\n\nTL;DR: The game is clunky and feels very dated, but the main story is really enthralling and worth the trip if you care about the lore enough.","August 15, 2014","true","28.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

We all know why you're here. To play this game before witcher 2 then 3. You may be hesitating whether to buy this game because the graphics look old, and the dialogues are horrible. And you're right, they are, but once you get past those, the game is pretty fun. There are some sex scenes (which I don't mind), but they're opitional and are just pictures of nude women. The story is average, if not above average. A group of super mercenaries, witchers, gets their mutant secrets stolen by a group of bandits, so Geralt must find them and grab it back.\n\nOne complaint is that the quests makes you walk back and forth around the map. Receive a quest on the left side of the map, complete it the right side, then talk to someone at the top, go back to the left, then receive reward at the right. The majority of the quests just make you run around until you get sick of the maps.\n\nBut the major flaw in this game is the glitchy combat system. There will be times when you need to tap to attack, but Geralt acts like an idiot and just stands still. There have been times when I would want to punch my monitor out of how frustrating it was.\n\nOverall: 7/10\nAlthough the combat and dialogue sucks, the story is indeed worth playing. There is a good sense of lore where you play a medeival fantasy setting. I would recommend this game if you plan on buying the sequels just so you can get a better understanding with the characters.\n\nSome tips if you play this game: spend time to make potions. The only other way to heal is sleeping or waiting for your health to regenerate by eating food. Also, if you deciede to play the extra adventure games, "Price of Neutrality" is the only one worth playing imo.","May 13, 2015","true","35.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I didn't finish TW my first time around as I loat interest around chapter 3. I had similar geelings the second time around but I was determined to finish it this time.\n\nGood point for the game:\n\n1. Story is interesting. If you aren't big on stories,  skip this game.\n2. Level system allows for some customization. I fully upgraded igni and aard for instance.\n3. Hard is challenging without using alchemy constantly.\n4. Choices matter for the storyline.\n\nDrawbacks:\n\n1. Combat is static. 3 styles and then signs. Once you know which style and swords to use you can cut up just about any enemy.\n2. Collecting alchemy ingredients is tedious as is running out of inventory for them.\n3. Side quests are very repetitive.  Kill x of y. Must read some book first. Boring!\n4. You can't change geralt's hairstyle!!!!\n5. Not for younger gamers as there is quite a bit of sexual content. Almost unnecessarily at times. I mean, the nurses? Really?\n6. Storyline in this game is unnecessary to enjoy TW2. Characters met at the beginning are not revisited after the prologue. Looking forward to seeing them in TW3.\n7. Some failed quests always remain active in your log. Hot potato for one.\n8. Holy lag starting in Chapter 3. FPS averaged around 30 in the Trade Quarter and sometimes lower at night in the swamp.\n\nThough I have more drawbacks than good points, it can still be worth playing if you like the gameplay mechanics, which grew on me I'll admit.

I enjoy games with deep stories that actually demand your attention, but this game lost me. I had to force myself to play it and beat it. It was a tough pill for me to swallow. As many people complain about, the combat system is just down right ridiculous and annoying. The game itself is looonggg. There were so many times I thought that I finally was getting close to the last fight, just to be thrust something else to do that was going to take another half hour to an hour to do. But as much as I struggled to finish it, I'm glad I did. The story, so long as you pay attention, is totally worth it. The choices they give you and consequences make sense.

First time I have ever played a story for so long, and first time playing The Witcher. I love the graphics and detail put into the game. The story is immersive beyond imagination, and the choices you make decide do impact the end (especially who you have sex with).\n\nI only have three complaints, and one is not so much a complaint.\n\n1. For some reason, neither my friend or myself can run this game on our laptops. I get that it is remastered and probably never programmed for the different processors and all that technical stuff, but when my laptop beats the specs by at least 40% it should at least run.\n\n2. The game uses far too many cutscenes during battle. I found that if I try to search the remains of bodies I can easily glitch to a black screen when accompanied with someone. This only happened twice but still can be a pain.\n\n3. The combat system takes some time mastering but by the end of it, I can hardly use The Witcher 2's system (it is the same but slightly different in a few aspects). This is not a complaint as much as a wish for the old style over the newer, more console friendly menu and combat system. If I could play The Witcher 3 with the same keys as the original, I would have more hours on that game.","June 7, 2015","true","39.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Bioware's Aurora2007 engine contributes to that jankiness a bit as well. For anyone that's played Neverwinter Nights (the original, not the f2p mmo), it kind of feels similar to that. The combat system is odd and tends to be a little bit difficult to get used to, but it serves as only a tool to let you indulge in the weird and wonderful world of The Witcher. Like all the other entries of the series, it's filled with great characters and a story that is echelons above most RPGs.\n\nAll in all, this is a rough gem that exceeds its value by far.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/milesofbaloney/recommended/20900/","milesofbaloney","Мilo of Lombardy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/milesofbaloney/","80 products in account","I'm writing this shortly after entering Chapter V. The reason I'm doing it now, is that the game's so intense and its world so prone to change that I fear I might not be able to have a clear mind on what I went through in the first 4 chapters after what is likely going to be a groundbreaking final chapter.\n\nI think few would disagree with the following statement: You'll both love and hate this game. At times you'll find yourself half asleep with your finger passively laying on the W key, and the only enthusiasm you might have left will be barely enough to head to the main menu and quit the game. Why is that? Because like Geralt loves saying, the game's "so full of ♥♥♥♥".  Back-and-forth is going to take almost all of your gametime from amidst chapter 1 until the end of chapter 4, although it will progressively decrease from the beginning of chapter III onwards. I'd want to invest more time to let all my frustration for Chapter II and III out, but it would make the following considerations futile to the reader.\n\nAnother thing worth mentioning is the combat. It is odd, and you'll nourish a deep hatred against it, but you'll eventually end up liking it - for the most part. I think the stances, the various disarm/stun/pain bonuses and the talents related to them are really interesting. So, regardless how bad and unfamiliar the combat moves myl feel, understanding how it works actually makes it better than click-spamming like a dumbass to strike enemies without reasoning (no reference to Assassins of Kings of course!).\n\nThis pretty much sums up the game mechanics. "Wow, really? What's your rationale for recommending the game then? You basically said it's all about walking and getting over the clunky combat system." I recommend it because the story is truly fascinating and if you managed to read this boring review on its entirety you'll likely get past the hours of tedious walking and enjoy the amazing plot this game has to offer. I wish I'd played the first game before AoK, to some extent.\n\nCome back to this review and leave a comment, if you've managed to finish the Witcher without falling in love with its characters, its twists, its grey morality and the amazing narration from Geralt. Frankly, there's one thing I didn't find immersive at all: the landscapes. Because of the constant walking you'll probably start hating many of the places this game includes, one at a time.\n\nLastly, we all refrain from being over-emotional when it comes to fictional stuff, but the first Witcher really gifted me with some good memories - sort as if it was a book - hence I guess the developers really inspired themselves to Sapkowski's work.\n\n11,06,15 EDIT\n\nI've finally completed the game, and I feel I must give a few advices: don't rush it avoiding all secondary quests, unless you've picked the easy difficulty. Besides that, remember to spend some time doing alchemy: gather ingredients, read the scrolls you collect during the story. Lastly, go get the Raven's armour even if you don't give a ♥♥♥♥ about it. I'm saying this, because you'll find it really hard to beat the bosses in chapter V and the epilogue (except for a couple which can be defeated through some exploits in the stupid AI). Taking down the Zeugl was exceptionally frustrating, and I had to load a savefile from 4-5 hours back in order to gather all the necessary to take it down.\n\nIdeally, you should enter the Old Manor at level 27 or above. If you want a further challenge without going hard mode ignore this, but I fathom you might have a bit of save reloading to get along with.\n\nWhat is a bit ridiculous is that whilst the Zeugl and the Koshchey, that are neither mentioned nor relevant during the story, are somewhat hard to beat; bosses like Javed and the true arch enemy (which I won't mention for your own sake) are relatively easy to kill.","June 9, 2015","true","47.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I heard before that it was a bad game, but I wanted to see for myself.  I suspect most players get put off by the confusing game mechanics, the combat system especially.  Once you play enough, you will get the hang of the game's systems.  I was slicing up Salamandra with ease by Chapter 2.\n\nIf you get bored of the slow detective-like story, don't worry because it picks up by Chapter 3.  You can beat the game easy by not doing any side quests, which is what I did.  The game has a dark and dingy atmosphere which can feel boring, but it's supposed to tie in with the atmosphere of the series.\n\nSome of the voice acting is pretty bad, and most of the characters faces look deformed.  Alvin and Dandelion are the worst.  The animations are pretty terrible aswell, like walking and Geralt's fighting.\n\nIf you like the story of The Witcher 2 and 3, and have a lot of patience, I recommend giving The Witcher 1 a shot.  The scene with The Lady of The Lake and Eredin's spectre at the end are some of my favorite scenes in all The Witcher series.","July 11, 2015","true","31.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

As you explore the world of The Witcher, you will be slaying monsters, fighting the Salamandra scum and choosing whether to help the people (and werewolves) of Vizima.\n\n\nWhile the controls get a little getting used to. they get the job done with simple timed-clicks and spell executions. Although, selecting what weapon you use via hotkeys can be confusing and clunky in general. Clicking the weapon you want is by far the easier solution.\n\n\nAlchemy is a large element of the game as it can give tempoary buffs to Geralt during combat or by granting the ability to let you see in the dark. You can also brew oils to increase your weapons' effectiveness and you can also craft bombs. But, these buffs come at a cost. Toxicity. When your toxicity bar becomes at least half full, Geralt starts to become intoxicated. The more the bar is filled (the more potions you drink), the more intoxicated Geralt will become resulting in him being slower, potions having a negative affect or he may just die instantly. However, toxicity can be cured by: meditating or by drinking White Honey.\n\n\nQuesting in this game consists of having a few main quest branches, a few side quest branches and miscellaneous monster contracts.The structure of the quests can be confusing as let's say, the main\nobjective is to (no spoilers here, just made up) talk to Triss about the enchanted rose. You do that and this piece of text appears under this quest: "Now that Triss knows about the rose, I should come back after I go and see the Druids." That puts this particular quest on hold for now. Then you get a new objective for a different quest that says: "Find the druids and get more information about the rose." You do that and then this quest goes on hold while you go back to Triss....I think you get my point. It's downright confusing!\n\n\nThere are activities in the game such as: fist fights & poker. The fist fights are boring once you learn the right tactics (rigging I mean) but if you want to make quick money, go right ahead. However, the poker is well done in this game. The music gets you into the gambling spirit!\n\n\nOverall, I have enjoyed this game a lot.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SeanBeta90/recommended/20900/","SeanBeta90","₣⊕ֆ | King Renly Baratheon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SeanBeta90/","182 products in account","On the PC, single player RPGs are becoming increasingly rare. Titles from larger companies seem to be relegated largely to remakes or ports of console games. Some smaller companies have stepped up to fill the gap, and while it would be easy for those companies to make subpar games given their small size and the lack of competition, there are some games, such as The Witcher: Enhanced Edition, which prove that great things can come from small companies.\n\nThe main character, Geralt, is a Witcher. Witchers are mutated humans with the ability to dispatch monsters. In return for their increased combat prowess, Witchers are unable to have children. Geralt is part of a small group of Witchers who find themselves besieged by a group of sorcerers. Everyone, including Geralt, is forced to investigate and track down this group. In doing so, Geralt comes face to face with his humanity, his friends and his ideas of morality.\n\nEnough cannot be said about this story. Based off a Polish novel, it is full of detail and character. The story and dialogue is so well written that, at times, it singlehandedly pulls the player into the game. The world of The Witcher is not a bright, green happy-go-lucky wonderland either. Filled with greed, racism, and poverty, the setting portrayed here is as close as any game has ever come in mixing real world problems with fantasy creatures such as elves, druids and dwarves.\n\nTo add further depth to the story elements, the decisions the player makes throughout the game have profound effects on the story and relationships with other characters. Simple conversation choices can change how other people, or even entire races, feels about Geralt. To add further weight to those decisions, numerous flashbacks liberally scattered throughout the story explore Geralt’s reflections on events and choices players made in the past. This is a refreshing contrast to other RPGs where your decisions (especially in conversations) have little or no impact on the story at all. Multiple playthroughs to discover different plots and endings certainly add to the replay value. Since decisions at the very beginning can have a domino effect on options later in the game, a complete replay or two may be necessary to experience all the differences.\n\nOf course, being a Witcher, Geralt must solve many situations with weapons and magic. Attacking others is as simple as choosing a weapon and clicking on the enemy. As Geralt attacks, the mouse icon flashes indicating an opportunity to get in an extra attack. By chaining together multiple attacks, massive damage can be done while minimizing incoming damage. Various weapons and magic attacks, each with strategic uses in different situations, keep combat interesting and engaging. Furthermore, potions can be made to provide numerous bonuses in tougher bouts. Things can be pretty hectic in some of the larger battles, but players can pause at any time to consider options and choose the next move. Unfortunately, aiming and camera control can be a bit challenging at times. Pausing allows the player to take their time for the most part, but when one of these issues happens in the middle of a combo, it can be frustrating and lead to the occasional death.\n\nExperience points are earned through fighting and completing missions. Upon leveling, Geralt can meditate and learn new skills. Aside from buffing melee combat and magic, gathering and creation skills may also be improved. Herbs and other materials may be found all over the world and made into potions, bombs and other items to aid during combat. And while potions may improve combat abilities temporarily, they also increase toxicity, so they may not be abused.\n\nVisually, most things look good. Up close, some character models, especially Geralt, look great. Coupled with some great movement, Geralt oozes attitude. On the other hand, there are so many different NPCs that the same character graphics are recycled numerous times, potentially confusing some players. Backgrounds, towns and surroundings are generally well done and detailed; however, significant fog effects and limited drawing distances show up often in several outdoor areas. Sound is done very well, with exceptional voice work\n\nThe Witcher: Enhanced Edition is a re-release of the original, bundled with substantial additions. A physical map, bonus DVDs, soundtracks, hintbooks and a couple of extra adventure modules are included. Furthermore, for owners of the original game, many of these bonuses may be downloaded for free from the main site. During the playthrough, several minor bugs and game crashes were experienced. However, the inconveniences were minor, and a quick scan of the forums indicates that these isssues pop up on a minority of computer setups. Also, The Witcher was infamous for its load times that made the game unplayable to some. This issue has been addressed, as scene transitions load quickly.\n\nOverall, The Witcher: Enhanced Edition is an amazing game. The combat system, while quite solid, may not grab everyone. The plot, characters and ability to affect the story will. What The Witcher: Enhanced Edition lacks in technical prowess and polish, it makes up for in heart. Every RPGamer who has ever complained of superficial plot devices and the lack of true decision making abilities in video game RPGs should absolutely give this game a run through. Anyone who plays this game will remember it for many years to come, and that is one of the highest forms of praise RPGamer can bestow on a game.","June 8, 2015","true","12.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's mechanics are fun, it's characters memorable, it's presentation a bit clunky, but everything comes together in a really good game.","March 29","true","56.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I played 2 and 3 first and was very surprised first of all by how ambitious the story of this older game is, but also by how much continuity there is between all three games. If you played 2/3, you probably followed along the story just fine, but you missed more than you think if you haven't played this game. And again, the story of this game is just as ambitious as its successors, even if the game itself is pretty rough around the edges.\n\nAs far as the gameplay, the combat bears little resemblance to its sequels, while the quest format felt surprisingly similar to Witcher 3. I think Witcher 3 is the game they wished they could have made in 2007, if CDPR had the tech and resources back then. But I must be clear about one thing: "clunky" isn't even a good descriptor for this game's combat system. The combat in this game straight up sucks. It's as idiotic as it is frustrating. However in my view it is worth putting up with if you were a fan of Witcher 2/3's stories or just a fan of story-driven games in general.","July 11, 2015","true","37.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I bought it on sale about a year ago and told it would be worth my money. So I get it running and start playing the prologue. I found the controls clunky and hard to control, the combat system seemed needlessly convoluted and I died multiple times at the first boss, because I was so confused. I didn't have the patience for the game at the time. But here I am writing a positive review. I let it sit in my library for months and started to feel guilty that I spent money on a game I didn't want to play. So I decided to pick it up again and was determined to play it further and finish it whether I liked it or not, I felt that I owed the game a fair play, a game that so many obviously love and I couldn't help but feel that maybe I was missing out on something. I was right.\n\nI restarted the game and took the time to play and learn, I still find the combat a bit clunky, but I've learned to manage and succeed playing the game. I've found that The Witcher has a rich story to tell. The music is beautiful and character interactions provide a lot of depth to the world. For each new character you meet, each new beast you fight, and every note or book you find, new story elements are uncovered and added to your journal. It's clear the developers put a lot of time and heart into this game.\n\nOne of the most intriguing elements of the game that nobody fails to mention is the Alchemy system. You gather various herbs, chemicals, and liquors which are used in alchemical recipes to create useful potions. You should pay attention to what you can use for a recipe because multiple subtitute reagents can be used as many materials contain the same derivative substance.\n\nThe Witcher is far from perfect, but it has just enough depth to keep me hooked, it's an adventure I'm excited to continue and see to the end.","July 13, 2015","true","13.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

I heard before that it was a bad game, but I wanted to see for myself.  I suspect most players get put off by the confusing game mechanics, the combat system especially.  Once you play enough, you will get the hang of the game's systems.  I was slicing up Salamandra with ease by Chapter 2.\n\nIf you get bored of the slow detective-like story, don't worry because it picks up by Chapter 3.  You can beat the game easy by not doing any side quests, which is what I did.  The game has a dark and dingy atmosphere which can feel boring, but it's supposed to tie in with the atmosphere of the series.\n\nSome of the voice acting is pretty bad, and most of the characters faces look deformed.  Alvin and Dandelion are the worst.  The animations are pretty terrible aswell, like walking and Geralt's fighting.\n\nIf you like the story of The Witcher 2 and 3, and have a lot of patience, I recommend giving The Witcher 1 a shot.  The scene with The Lady of The Lake and Eredin's spectre at the end are some of my favorite scenes in all The Witcher series.","July 11, 2015","true","31.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Well written, clever and witty, with those all-important story impacting choices, character progression and build refinement, I think this is one of the most pleasant games I have played in the last year and easily the most rewarding (I played and got tired of both Bioshock Infinite and The Walking Dead Season 2, but kept coming back to this game).\n\nBeautifully done, and with a more gritty mature take on the genre, the game fits in perfectly in the world of Andrzej Sapkowski. A little word of advice - if you plan to read the series then do so first before playing the games or else MAJOR story spoilers will ensue.","September 8, 2015","true","56.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If you're a RPG newbie like me, potions, oils and stuff might be quite confusing, but it plays (in my mind) like an old-school point'n'click adventure with action bits.\n\nCombat is not great and production value could be higher (lot of models are reused constantly), but the story is quite interesting and the main character is quite complex and multidimensional.

It is unlike any other RPG I've played in a while. I love the special agent/PI character that is Geralt, it's quite unique for the genre. As is the combat style. Fights (including boss fights) can be surprisingly easy or incredibly difficult based on how much you've paid attention and done your homework. For players of other series, the game has level design and exploration along the lines of Dragon Age, with a combat style that (oddly) reminds me of the Jedi Knight games.\n\nThe game has many faults, though. Character assets are reused over and over with only a couple dozen unique characters in the game (surprisingly, though, this didn't irritate me as much as it might sound). Voice acting cutscenes are of a mediocre quality; not terrible but they've been surpassed elsewhere (like the subsequent entries in the series). Combat can be incredibly frustrating sometimes. For example, being stunned repeatedly by four wraiths to the point you cannot move or attack is maddening. It also felt that there were too many elements to the game, some of which can be (and ultimately have to be) ignored in favour of others. For example, I didn't get anywhere near maxing out my character (despite doing every quest) and never touched bombs. I also didn't feel all the signs were as useful as they could be; some easily overshadow others. Combat is generally quite easy (with a few exceptions).\n\nI very much enjoyed the claustrophobic, urban setting of the first half of the game. When it changed setting in the second half I was, at first, relieved for a change of scenery but the following areas (while containing enjoyable quests) are overly large and it feels like all you're ever doing is walking from point to point (with, surprisingly - compared to earlier areas - few enemies to worry about). The game also has a somewhat awkward, somewhat rewarding epilogue sequence, a huge twist (if you're paying attention) and a cliffhanger ending.\n\nOverall, I'd recommend it if you really want to play the entire trilogy. But if you're not that fussed, I'd probably suggest just reading up on what happens in the first game (and about its characters) and moving on to The Witcher 2 (where things improve and change drastically).","September 11, 2015","true","65.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Took about 50 hours to beat the game 100%, so not too long for a RPG. Regardless, excellent story, great graphics for when it came out and for the most part, great voice acting. (Excluding Dandelion...) Fascinating world, and lot's of fun to be had.\n\nPlus there are boobies. And monsters that let their wang hang all the way. (You know, if you're into that sort of thing.)\n\nReally dark and mature, and slightly depressing. Game does not shy away from adult content/humor. Plus there is so much sex. No really. This game is like Game of Thrones but for video games. Geralt is such a player that it's not funny. At one point you can choose to have an affair that takes up an entire chapter of the game. It's great fun.\n\nFun decision making with real consequences and some cool optional quests. Also very memorable characters... easy to know what you need to do, and the game isn't overly difficult. (That is if you don't mind spending hours and hours grinding your levels)\n\nPlus, it has a great cliff hanger leading straight into the sequel...\n\nHighly recommended. Especially since Steam sells the definitive Director's Cut for so cheap.\n\nDon't think, just buy it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jahoult/recommended/20900/","jahoult","jahoult","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jahoult/","27 products in account","The Witcher is a rough diamond.  Some of the translation to English results in odd conversations, some sections (mainly the swamp) are a bit of a grind, the combat can be repetitive and I had the occasional crash.  There are also some upgrades, signs and potions that are much more useful than others.\n\nAt times, too, it wasn't particularly clear about why you were doing what you were doing, or which speech option would get you which result.  But that's part of what makes The Witcher rewarding to play - it doesn't always hold your hand or telegraph every step in the plot.  The story is engrossing and, translation aside, the characters are great (even though most of the 'romances' are just Geralt saying "let's bang, ok?") and you will quickly realise that you can't please everyone.  There are definitely a few tough choices to make.\n\nThe game takes a while to warm up so don't be put off by the slow start.  Also, if you're finding it difficult and dying a lot then - like me, initially - you're doing it wrong.  There are always potions, blade coatings, signs or upgrades that make beating particular enemies (and the game) much easier.  When in doubt: Swallow.\n\nWhile The Witcher lacks some of the polish (not Polish) of its AAA RPG cousins, it more than makes up for it in the depth of story and the adult RPG elements.  Highly recommended for anyone who wants to lose themselves in a game.","May 23, 2014","true","73.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/peterhollo/recommended/20900/","peterhollo","CorvusCorax","http://steamcommunity.com/id/peterhollo/","533 products in account","A unique role-playing game that is a rarity these days. Developed by a Polish company and is based on the book with the same title written by a Polish author called Andrzej Sapkowski. You play as Geralt, a mutant hunter who is specialised in fighting and slaying monsters. At the beginning of Geralt's story he does not remember much - he's found unconscious and is taken to the witchers' hideout. The establishment, then, is attacked by a group of bandits known as the Salamander - although defending the castle is a success, the witchers are unable to stop the bandits from stealing their precious mutagens. Geralt and his fellow witchers, therefore, set out to find where the gang is hiding and of course to take back what is rightfully theirs.\n\nSome notable elements that characterises Witcher and makes it different from other RPGs:\n\n--- Controlling Geralt is very easy. The game offers you several camera perspectives, in fact, even the input device can be changed: focus can be on the mouse solely or you can use the combination of the keyboard and mouse - whichever is your preference.\n\n--- During combat timing is very important. The game being hack-and-slash requires you to hit enemies several times. This, Geralt does automatically, but following the hit of his blade you can have a follow-up click with your mouse - if your timing is perfect Geralt does make a follow-up cut which is stronger and deadlier. In addition to this the game employs 3 combat styles. Larger enemies require the strong style: Geralt carefully times each hit and while they are slower they result in a heavier slash. Faster enemies simply avoid your attacks but changing to the fast style enables you to hit them. And if your are surrounded you need to use the group style.\n\n--- Beside the styles and the timing you should be careful with the material your weapon is made of. While steel-made swords are perfect against human beings and some of the monsters you encounter there are many supernatural beings in the Witcher's world you can only wound with a silver-made sword.\n\nAnd here come those that made me like the game a lot:\n\n--- Choices: Yes, yes, this is common. You decide to help or you simply let people die. Right? No! Witcher does not indicate what will happen once a decision is made. Unlike Mass Effect, here there are no indicators and nobody tells you whether it is good or bad what you'll attempt to do. In certain cases both decisions you can make will result in the death of someone - you need to decide which is "better" or you simply need to pick A) so that in your next playthrough you can go with option B.\n\n--- Alchemy: A very important part of the game! There are severals types of plants / herbs out there you need to collect. You can then use these at fireplaces to create potions that either make you stronger or grant you an extra ability (e.g. seeing in dark places). Interestingly, all of these poison Geralt to a certain degree - your toxicity level increases and eventually you need to rest or drink another potion that neutralises the adverse effect of these drinks. The more scrolls you find the more potions are available - you can also experiment if you have the time.\n\nIt should be noted that Geralt is mainly a warrior. You have some spells called signs but they are nothing special. So, in your next playthrough you cannot have a significantly different build - you can experiment, for sure, but the value lies in Witcher's world. And this world is huge. I like how the game starts filling up your Glossary - a menu similar to the codex in the Dragon Ages series containing all kinds of entries explaining the world to the gamer. Also, while fistfighting is rather easy and boring the drinking and dice-poker mini games are excellent and make the game quite funny!\n\nI finished the game in 50+ hours and pretty much completed everything I could. I read the game's wikia pages parallelly and found that I'd missed some missions and if I remember correctly the game has at least 2 endings. So there you go: over 100 hours and this is only for 8 bucks! In addition to this, it comes in the form of a so-called Enhanced Edition that offers a lot of extras such as making-of videos and other campaigns. Plus, the game looks quite good for being released in 2007!\n\nOverall, Witcher is a unique RPG. If you are fan of the genre and finished multiple playthroughs in Dragon Age then do head for the store page as this game must be in your basket!","May 2, 2014","true","52.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It feels strange, it is strange, it is VERY random and has rarely anything to do with actual skill gameplay. Ok I lied. It is COMPLETELY random and the weapons only differ in their damage (effects). That's it.\n-a lot of on foot backtracking and annoying enemy encounters that can't be avoided because they sprint after you faster than Usain Bolt\n- some quests are stupidely hard ( example: escort that 1 chick from a village to another, she dies from 2 enemy dog attacks and it's IMPOSSIBLE to keep her protected the entire time because at least 1 dog always attacks her, therefore losing the mission and forcing you to restart, bringing me to my next point)\n-the save system is non existant basically, as the game only ( if ever) saves every half an houri and believe me, if you forget to save yourself 5 times in 2 minutes, backtracking half an hour in this game will basically make you so mad and annoyed that you stop playing the game, like I did after multiple times where I just can't focus saving every 2 minutes because I have other important stuff to mind about in the game already.\n-hunky npc interaction, basically there is rarely any clue if your recent dialog helped you gain any useful information for a quest, except if you start a new one\n- I have yet to find out ( if I ever start playing again) if the skilltrees are actually effecting my game in any ways, because as I said above, I feel like I skill up but gain nothing from it.\n- inventory management is purely a pain in the ♥♥♥ because you never get any hints if the stuff u have in an inventory will help u later in a quest, therefore you keep them and if you drop an item and DO need it later on, you can backtrack half an hour, which kills the entire fun in this game.\n\n\n\nConclussion: I would personally skip this game if I had a chance, but since I bought it for only 2 euros, I can't complain since this game convinced me to play the other Witcher games, which I have heard have improved a lot from the first one. I do not directly regret the Witcher 1 purchase, but would recommend skipping this one and buying the second one directly.\n","March 9, 2015","true","32.9"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

As the combat took some getting use too for me I didn't touch it again.  After a few months I'm back on it, having played further into the story it really has drawn me in. I've also got use to the combat now. The combat itself was for me the only major negative I could think of  that this game had but like I said now I have got use to it. Also some of the voice acting could have been done better. It's not an open world rpg such as Skyrim but has much more depth than that title.

The graphics still hold up, and the combat is fine as long as you know what you're getting into- a Diablo-style click on the bad guy to hit him, then hit him again if he's still alive, and if you REALLY mean business hit him a third, fourth, and (you masochist) fifth time.  If you're used to RPG's give it a go on hard- it's adds much more depth using the potions and blade oils, as well as magic signs (I'm an Aard fanatic).  I've heard the pre-Enchanced Edition was somewhat rough, with longer loading times and only about 4 non-Geralt character skins, so if you played it when it first came out it could be worth reloading and seeing what you've missed.","May 22, 2015","true","43.0"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

I didn't like it the first time I tried it because I didn't know what I was getting into. The second time however I feel in love. I will note a few things though:\n\nThe game as a whole is dull until Chapter 2\n\nThe game focuses on dialog and character development as much if not more than combat. If that turns you off I wouldn't recommend this game.\n\nThe combat is more repetitive than most games, but tolerable.\n\nThe game fails to give tutorials on how some mechanics/controls works. For instance: You hold down shift to see your mouse cursor to click on your signs. There I just saved you 5 minutes of google searching.\n\nThe dialog is really bad in the first chapter, but significantly raises in quality after that.\n\nClosing Thoughts: If you like RPG's that are character driven this is the game for you.

Although, the story is straight-forward, it has different elements that make it awesome. The combat mechanics are a bit of a letdown, but you have 3 different fighting styles and 5 powers too, so you can use a combination of that to improve your fighting experience. The alchemy and the universe - lore - are really amazing. You have a lot of detailed information about monsters, characters, missions and the world of Temeria, where the adventure of the Witcher is set. Although the graphics are outdated, and some npc's models recycled, the atmosphere is flawless, you can feel like you are Geralt.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dowlphin/recommended/20900/","dowlphin","Dandowlion","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dowlphin/","265 products in account","It is probably helpful for the reader if I compare The Witcher to Skyrim:\n\nWhile Skyrim 'feels' like a computer game, a role playing game, and maybe could be described as having a slight theatrical vibe, playing The Witcher feels like reading a good book. It is very character- and story-focused. Geralt of Rivia is a very down-to-earth and likeable character and the game doesn't try to glorify or overly dramatize things. Those subtleties make the game feel even more believable and realistic than the medieval setting already does.\nI was worried that because of this, the game might be overly gruesome, but it's not. It has a certain charme.\n\nI actually like that the game world is relatively limited and that you revisit places a lot, which change every now and then. It gives the whole setting more depth. I also can more easily relate to the various quests, see them as part of a whole. At times the game makes it difficult to stop, because, as I said, it's like reading a good book where you're always at some interesting point.\n\nThe combat isn't overly detailed, which makes it more fun to play around with the various combat stances and alchemical helpers and just watch and enjoy the action. I also like the very limited selection of weapons and armor. It would just be unnecessary complication. I personally don't like stuff that much, and the alchemy is still tolerable to me, because when you play on medium difficulty, you don't have to dive deep into that. A few potions here and there and it'll be fine.\n\nI like very much how the game doesn't put too much time pressure on you. Many of the temporarily active helpers are long-lasting (e.g. a blade sharpening that lasts a full day of in-game time), and the in-game time progresses slowly enough that you don't end up hurrying around before the 'wrong time of day' sets in.\n\nIt's easy for me to overlook the various small flaws of the game. They're not too immersion-breaking, and the UI has some minor complications that aren't too bothersome. (Among the things that bother me most is that in some free range areas there are artificial fences, requiring you to walk all the way around. But it's just a minor inconvenience.)\n\nThe decisions you make in various situations don't feel like dummies that pretend to have an effect, but there are (some) consequences, so you actually feel like playing a role.\nI sometimes would have wished for more flexibility in dialogues when decision-making is involved, but again: Not a big deal.\n\nThe Witcher is just so different from that 'typical game experience'. A very good translation of a book series to a computer game. Again... It's almost as if you're 'playing a novel', but totally not like an interactive novel, and also not like those modern games that linearly push you from scene to scene, but a proper, mature computer game with focus on story and character interaction. You're wandering around in a story.\n\nIn fact, what makes this game great reminds me a bit of the Half-Life series, but with less action and less linearity. At least the first game was based on the work of a real horror story author.\n\n\nSpecific things that bothered me significantly:\n- No access to storage in chapter 5 - you have to work with what you have and can't restock from your storage. Even worse, at the beginning of the chapter you are allowed access, but shortly after, you are barred from it.\n- Voice dialogues contain many instances of wrong emphasis due to the VA not knowing the context of the line.\n- Geralt keeps sheathing his weapon after a few seconds against my intention to not do that.\n- Drawing the sword (except in strong stance) makes Geralt move faster, so basically for fast travel always draw your sword. I wish there was a better way to travel quickly than this obvious workaround.\n- Fist fight is very weird. There are skills for various moves, but not enough tutorial to explain how they work, so my fist fighting ended up very simplistic. Situation-dependent combos rarely ever worked properly.\n\n- Geralt of Review","March 30, 2014","true","49.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Most of the time.\n\nLets start with the good. It feels like an old timey RPG, with very simplistic, but addictive gameplay models. While the combat may not be supremely engaging, it can be very difficult at times, making preparation before a battle vital to surviving. All you need to do is master the almost, but not quite quicktime attack combat. The animations become more complex, and faster while requiring more timing and clicking with each improvement, making you feel like your moves are getting better and you feel all the more better.\n\nSome potions are easy to make, some are not. Some are very helpful, some not so much. But each one can save your life in a dire situation. You can make a variety of bombs, potions, and oils/weapon enhancements. Some potions even make your character more powerful in general, giving him different abilities and ways to unlock special skills.\n\nTime to talk about the negatives.\n\nThe negatives of this game are few, but can really screw with you. My system is very up-to-date and has been updated to keep with the times. However, I have experienced several blue screens through my playtime. I found this extremely odd and angering since no other game has done such a thing to me in the past. Glitches are slightly prevelant, but shouldn't cause too much trouble, and sometimes, the combat can be, at some times, meh. Sometimes, grinding is a factor you might have to use, going through a dangerous swamp to find a single herb for a swallow.\n\nIn conclusion, this is a great game, while rough around the edges, is very well made, and has fairly good graphics considering it was made in 2008. I strongly recommend this game, and remember, don't play the other witchers without starting from the beginning. Otherwise, nothing will make much sense in the long run.","December 7, 2015","true","36.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The voice acting, character animations, and combat can be a little rough for some, but ultimately the game itself presents an excellent story and really pulls you in to assume the role of a witcher. You'll memorize what combat styles and Signs are useful for each monsters, learn the appearance and usage of herbs throughout the world, and you'll read and learn the lore of the Witcher.\n\nThe game presents choices throughout the game, some of which affect the story later. It is up to you decide whether Geralt will take sides or maintain his neutrality as a witcher.\n\nUltimately, if you intend to play the Witcher 2 or Witcher 3, I recommend you play the full trilogy for the full experience.","August 1, 2015","true","95.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Too bad Geralt get amnesia and forget all his fighting skill, magic and knowledge.\n\nThe witcher is RPG game with lot of things to do and learn,\n\nStory is so good it’s a pure sex, literally.\nEvery quest have story in it.\nYou will have to make a choice, take side, spare or kill which will impact the story later on.\n\nThere is also many interesting things to do. Play dice poker, Fist fight, Hunt monster, Help random people and collect romance cards AKA getting laid.\n\nYou want to have threesome with nurse? Orgy with vempires? Passionate love with sorcerer? This game have it all!!\n\nGraphic is quite good, for old game. The atmosphere and graphic fit the wolrd of witcher nicely.\nMusic are very good too especially boss fight.\n\nGameplay is fun. Combat? Not so much.\nWhen you attack Garelt will perform one set of sword move. When the move end cursor will change and you have to click attack again to make combo. If you click attack before or too late the move will stop. It's not that bad actually after you get used to and quite fun later in the game when you are strong but overall combat feel clunky, unresponsive and can be frustrated.\n\nGameplay is fun and addictive but you will found yourself walking around the map doing quest. Go there, do that kinda thing. No fast travel in this game too. While I find myself enjoy the world and love exploring it. Walking around across the map many times can be boring.\n\nGame mechanics take awhile to get used to. Especially alchemy and crafting.\nThere is a steel sword for fight human and silver sword to fight monster. There is 3 different fighting style for different enemies. There is potions, blade oils, bombs with different effect which you can make and use if you get ingredients. You will have to buy books or find information about each monster and herb to be able to collect it. And many other little thing.\nIt will feel annoying at first but it will be a lot of fun after you get used to it. Too bad that I start to feel fun in the last chapters of the game.\n\nThe witcher may have boring start with it gameplay and story especially if you have play other witcher games before. Give it a try for a few hour first before you decide to uninstaling it.\n\nConclusion  The Witcher overall is a very fun RPG. Rich in story and charecter. Combat might not be the best and game mechanics might be confusing but worth to play and I'm sure you won't regret it.\nIf you interesting in the witcher series from CDPR DO NOT skip this one.\n\nps: sorry for my english.","July 28, 2015","true","50.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The atmosphere resembles the dark middle ages, where poverty, war and disease has struck down on the denizens of this world.\n\nYou are Geralt of Rivia, a Witcher who is both respected and despised for his line of work. Your profession is to dispose of creatures of the dark, demons and foul creatures by means of spell, sword and alchemy.\nHowever, in the beginning of the game you are struck by amnesia and thus your past is unknown to you. This is a central plot in the game, as you will carve your own destiney in the god-forsaken universe of the Witcher. Choosing between right and wrong is difficult, if not impossible, as every decision you make will depend on your own moral code. There are no heroes, no real villains, as everyone is fighting for themselves and characters are thus "grey" - they all contain classically noble character traits and "evil" traits. Consequently, the demons you are sent to kill can appear more humane than the village priest who would rather have you kill seemingly innocent people.\n\nThe game is highly recommendable, despite its now outdated graphics. The quality of the game experience is enjoyable, and several replays is almost inevitable if you want to know what would have happened if you just had sided with the other faction.. or none at all.","April 20, 2014","true","47.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ravenize/recommended/20900/","ravenize","Ravenize > *","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ravenize/","338 products in account","Since coming out in 2007 The Witcher has aged nicely, thanks to some extra care from the devs. The combat system is a bit clunky, and the graphics are certainly not modern, but it nonetheless remains very playable. Compared to other games of that era like Oblivion or Mass Effect it's a bit below them, but a still solid game. If those are 5's this would be a 4.\n\nIt's a super interesting world and story that has a really nice hook at the beginning. Sadly, the game's pacing suffers for the first half after that. Thankfully it picks up steam in the second half before ending in a full-speed-ahead-rollercoaster-esque finale, complete with some unexpected (but welcome and thoroughly explained) plot twists. I was very happy with the way things ended and everything leading up to it.\n\nMy biggest complaint other than the pacing problems early on is really difficulty. After the game first gives you some non-linear freedom it is incredibly difficult. Frustratingly so. But somewhere around a third of the way in you unlock enough abilities that it becomes exceedingly easy, and it stays that way through the end. I wish there had been more of a gradual incline rather than this steep cliff drop off. Hopefully the sequels correct this.\n\nAnd my favorite thing about this game is just how adult it is. They really don't hold back and that's something I've been waiting for in games for a very long time. This is really the first game that aligns more with a movie's R rating, and that makes it unique. Some others have caught up recently, but for the time I'd say this was pretty revolutionary.\n\nOverall I'm glad to have sunk time into this, and I'll be installing The Witcher 2 soon.","December 17, 2014","true","51.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Some unique elements that are mildly annoying, but add to realism/immersion. Morally grey decisions that cause game-lasting changes to various elements. 8.5/10\n\nGreat action RPG with some unique elements that separate it from the rest of it's genre. On the hard difficulty with the Extreme Immersion mod installed (which removes much of the HUD and other elements that make things feel more game-y), it presented a good challenge that never got too frustrating.\n\nThe combat system is a bit weird, but not bad once you get used to it. Instead of 1 click per attack, you click once and Geralt launched into a combo. Then you click again at the end of the combo to begin the next flurry. Proper timing leads to much better (and cooler looking) attacks.\n\nItems/potions that restore chunks of health instantly are rare (I know of one). Instead, everything just makes your natural health regen faster. A bit annoying at times, but it does add a bit more realism to the game.\n\nYou can't gather alchemy ingredients if you don't know they exist. Again, a bit annoying, but adds realism. If you didn't know that a dog's liver was good for making potions, why would you ever take it out, right?\n\nFinally, this is one of those RPGs that forces you to make various moral decisions (many of which will affect the later chapters in the game significantly, so choose wisely). However, unlike many games which hvae clear "good" and "bad" choices, Witcher almost always makes you choose between two equally bad options. For example (spoilers incoming), at one point you decide whether to support a village whose leaders are murderers, rapists, and child traffickers or to support the witch they are trying to lynch, who aided many of those same leaders herself. Both are clearly in the wrong, but you must decide which to kill and which to save. That decision will affect various things for the remainder of the game (my advice: save the witch).","June 23, 2014","true","72.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I didn't finish TW my first time around as I loat interest around chapter 3.

Level system allows for some customization. I fully upgraded igni and aard for instance.\n3. Hard is challenging without using alchemy constantly.\n4. Choices matter for the storyline.\n\nDrawbacks:\n\n1. Combat is static. 3 styles and then signs. Once you know which style and swords to use you can cut up just about any enemy.\n2. Collecting alchemy ingredients is tedious as is running out of inventory for them.\n3. Side quests are very repetitive.  Kill x of y. Must read some book first. Boring!\n4. You can't change geralt's hairstyle!!!!\n5. Not for younger gamers as there is quite a bit of sexual content. Almost unnecessarily at times. I mean, the nurses? Really?\n6. Storyline in this game is unnecessary to enjoy TW2. Characters met at the beginning are not revisited after the prologue. Looking forward to seeing them in TW3.\n7. Some failed quests always remain active in your log. Hot potato for one.\n8. Holy lag starting in Chapter 3. FPS averaged around 30 in the Trade Quarter and sometimes lower at night in the swamp.\n\nThough I have more drawbacks than good points, it can still be worth playing if you like the gameplay mechanics, which grew on me I'll admit.

The story and lore of the world created in these games by itself is so immense I felt that captivated by it's story. So captivated in fact that I even started reading the books! The book series story chronologically takes place before the game series begins, and they do a fantastic job making the world created in the books come to life visually! What's even better is that you don't have to read the books to get into the game but it often gives a player whose read them a tip of the hat with settle references to the book series non-readers would miss. I highly recommend reading the book series to really get into this world of The Witcher, but enough about that! Let's get into the pro's and cons! Skip to the recaps at the bottom of each one if you don't feel like reading it all\n\nPros:\nEven though this game is almost a decade old it still holds a lot of core RPG and really compared to today's RPG still feels fresh.\nIt has a story that changes based on your decisions, which leads to my next pro\nThis series allows you to port your saves over from game to game. The decisions you make in Witcher 1 effect Witcher 2's story, and Witcher 2 carries over to Witcher 3. Not only does the decisions carry over, but the rare items I work so hard to aquire carry over too! I have began playing Witcher 2 and I was relieved to see my armor, swords, runes, potions, etc. Were all still with me! Especially since most of the awesome rare items are only available towards the end of Witcher 1, but totally worth getting so you can have them in Witcher 2.\nDifferent points of view. Using the F1, F2, F3 you can change from bird's eye view to over the shoulder view! GIving the player the choice to play by their preference.\nYou get to see boooooobs, and lots of them. Geralt (your character) gets some strange!\nThe story is fantastic. Playing as a Witcher, a master of sword, magic, and alchemy set on hunting down a real ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ sums it up BUT there is SO much content and unexpected twists.\n\nRecap of pros: Well written story, carry over decisions and items throughout the series(Mass Effect got nothing on Witcher), gettin' some strange. (Seriously, Geralt get's laid in like the first 30 mins of the game)\n\nCONS:\nWhen doing quest the NPC you need to talk to isn't always at the quest marker. So I'll be tracking it on my map, get there, and the NPC is no where to be found. That's because this game has a constant time cycle and simulates day and night. I simply have to wait (or rest to speed it up) till the certain time period for the NPC to show up again. I get it, it adds realism to the game but dammit I hate having to wait for shop keepers to show up I want to buy my items now dammit.\nThe NPCs are massivley cloned. ALOT of NPC's, other than the important ones, look just like each other. There are a handful of character designs used for townsfolk, gang members, soldiers etc. So it kind of ruins the immerse effect sometimes. I cut Projekt Red a break though, I mean, when this game was developed it's probably the best they could do with the tech we had.  Same with the voice acting too. The special NPC's are their own voice actors throughout the series, but the forementioned NPCs I feel like was 2 or 3 voice actors. All the bandits sound the same.\nCompared to todays Open world RPG this game's world is small. Super small. I'm sure at the time this game was released it was very cutting edge but now adays it's going to feel like a small sandbox to the average RPG player. Still a great world though.\nand finally, the combat system. It takes some getting used to. After I figured it out it was very simple but just clicking on an enemy Diablo style won't work. It's click, wait for the icon, click again. Though after powering up combo's it is fun to watch Geralt slash open an enemy.\n\nCons recap: Cloned NPC's, short on voice acting, unexplained missing quest NPCs (until undefined time of day), combat system is wierd compared to today's RPGs.\n\nOverall I give this one 8/10 Toast for Twenty's and am definitely looking forward to playing the rest of the sereis, including the books.\n\n\n","August 12, 2015","true","56.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It will build up to the events of Witcher II, but also to Witcher III. In fact, there's a key moment close to the end where your decisions will make a difference in the third game.\nDon't play the other two games without having a go with this one.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/milesofbaloney/recommended/20900/","milesofbaloney","Мilo of Lombardy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/milesofbaloney/","80 products in account","I'm writing this shortly after entering Chapter V. The reason I'm doing it now, is that the game's so intense and its world so prone to change that I fear I might not be able to have a clear mind on what I went through in the first 4 chapters after what is likely going to be a groundbreaking final chapter.\n\nI think few would disagree with the following statement: You'll both love and hate this game. At times you'll find yourself half asleep with your finger passively laying on the W key, and the only enthusiasm you might have left will be barely enough to head to the main menu and quit the game. Why is that? Because like Geralt loves saying, the game's "so full of ♥♥♥♥".  Back-and-forth is going to take almost all of your gametime from amidst chapter 1 until the end of chapter 4, although it will progressively decrease from the beginning of chapter III onwards. I'd want to invest more time to let all my frustration for Chapter II and III out, but it would make the following considerations futile to the reader.\n\nAnother thing worth mentioning is the combat. It is odd, and you'll nourish a deep hatred against it, but you'll eventually end up liking it - for the most part. I think the stances, the various disarm/stun/pain bonuses and the talents related to them are really interesting. So, regardless how bad and unfamiliar the combat moves myl feel, understanding how it works actually makes it better than click-spamming like a dumbass to strike enemies without reasoning (no reference to Assassins of Kings of course!).\n\nThis pretty much sums up the game mechanics. "Wow, really? What's your rationale for recommending the game then? You basically said it's all about walking and getting over the clunky combat system." I recommend it because the story is truly fascinating and if you managed to read this boring review on its entirety you'll likely get past the hours of tedious walking and enjoy the amazing plot this game has to offer. I wish I'd played the first game before AoK, to some extent.\n\nCome back to this review and leave a comment, if you've managed to finish the Witcher without falling in love with its characters, its twists, its grey morality and the amazing narration from Geralt. Frankly, there's one thing I didn't find immersive at all: the landscapes. Because of the constant walking you'll probably start hating many of the places this game includes, one at a time.\n\nLastly, we all refrain from being over-emotional when it comes to fictional stuff, but the first Witcher really gifted me with some good memories - sort as if it was a book - hence I guess the developers really inspired themselves to Sapkowski's work.\n\n11,06,15 EDIT\n\nI've finally completed the game, and I feel I must give a few advices: don't rush it avoiding all secondary quests, unless you've picked the easy difficulty. Besides that, remember to spend some time doing alchemy: gather ingredients, read the scrolls you collect during the story. Lastly, go get the Raven's armour even if you don't give a ♥♥♥♥ about it. I'm saying this, because you'll find it really hard to beat the bosses in chapter V and the epilogue (except for a couple which can be defeated through some exploits in the stupid AI). Taking down the Zeugl was exceptionally frustrating, and I had to load a savefile from 4-5 hours back in order to gather all the necessary to take it down.\n\nIdeally, you should enter the Old Manor at level 27 or above. If you want a further challenge without going hard mode ignore this, but I fathom you might have a bit of save reloading to get along with.\n\nWhat is a bit ridiculous is that whilst the Zeugl and the Koshchey, that are neither mentioned nor relevant during the story, are somewhat hard to beat; bosses like Javed and the true arch enemy (which I won't mention for your own sake) are relatively easy to kill.","June 9, 2015","true","47.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Most of the time.\n\nLets start with the good. It feels like an old timey RPG, with very simplistic, but addictive gameplay models. While the combat may not be supremely engaging, it can be very difficult at times, making preparation before a battle vital to surviving. All you need to do is master the almost, but not quite quicktime attack combat. The animations become more complex, and faster while requiring more timing and clicking with each improvement, making you feel like your moves are getting better and you feel all the more better.\n\nSome potions are easy to make, some are not. Some are very helpful, some not so much. But each one can save your life in a dire situation. You can make a variety of bombs, potions, and oils/weapon enhancements. Some potions even make your character more powerful in general, giving him different abilities and ways to unlock special skills.\n\nTime to talk about the negatives.\n\nThe negatives of this game are few, but can really screw with you. My system is very up-to-date and has been updated to keep with the times. However, I have experienced several blue screens through my playtime. I found this extremely odd and angering since no other game has done such a thing to me in the past. Glitches are slightly prevelant, but shouldn't cause too much trouble, and sometimes, the combat can be, at some times, meh. Sometimes, grinding is a factor you might have to use, going through a dangerous swamp to find a single herb for a swallow.\n\nIn conclusion, this is a great game, while rough around the edges, is very well made, and has fairly good graphics considering it was made in 2008. I strongly recommend this game, and remember, don't play the other witchers without starting from the beginning. Otherwise, nothing will make much sense in the long run.","December 7, 2015","true","36.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

As you travel along as a Geralt you face many monsters, persons, fights, magic and problems. What is great about Witcher, is the possibility to choose from options how to make the plot go on. I wish I could stop the time and start it all over, just to see what other fates I could have faced. Talent-tree keeps playing interesting and let's players choose what kind of gameplay they prefer. Some problems still bug Witcher and one of them is limited amount of character models. It's not a big problem, but might get annoying for some if the same npc-face in different clothes isn't making sense. Another thing is that Mac version is quite bad port, so the game does crash from time to time and isn't working as it should. Still the game was playable and didn't stop me from enjoying this spectacular piece of pure art. Definitely one of my all-time-favorites.","October 13, 2012","true","36.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The combat system is a bit wonky but you do get used to it after a while and it's fun to make a few mouse clicks and watch Geralt slice and dice like a maniac. I got a lot of good times out of this game. Probably the only irritating thing is how slow Geralt runs and how often quests will require you to traverse the same ground over and over.\nThe story is top notch and the choices you can make are interesting and matter quite a bit. Plus you can bring your save file over into the second game which can earn you some special armor and weapons if you've gotten them in this game. They're not the best stuff you can get in the second game, which is a bit lousy since they're given much adieu in this game to just be sold off for a pittance in the next one but I guess that's their way of balancing things.\nOverall, it's an experience that is worth having if you want to have an understanding of Geralt's backround before heading into the second and third game.","September 20, 2015","true","55.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I saw the game was on sale, and I remembered all the times I had heard people praise the Witcher 2, I thought to myself; "Maybe I should give this series a try." Upon starting the game, my first thought was: "Oh God this game looks horrible". Still, I decided to give the game a fair chance. A few moments into the tutorial portion of the game, I was told to take a sword. As the protagonist, the famed Geralt of Rivia, raised his sword, I was metaphorically speechless. I had never seen anyone, in any game, movie, or book hold a sword how Geralt did. It was the single most stupid way to hold a sword during a fight. It took tremendous courage from me not to close the game on that instant and swear to never open it again, but I persevered. I continued, and because of that, I got to enjoy, maybe one of the best tales ever told in a game.\n\nThe Witcher is one of the best games I have ever played, the story, the characters, the action, it is awesome in every way. Although the game looks a bit dated (well, it is 7 years old), it would be foolish to turn down this game for that. The mechanics of the game may seem a bit weird in the beginning, but one grows quite accustomed to them in a few hours. This game literally ate away my free time over Christmas, and I regret not a single moment of it. If you haven't played it yet, go do so now, you will not regret it.","February 22, 2015","true","36.6"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

The combat isn't terribly challenging, some of the quests fall into the RPG tropes of "fetch quests" or "go here and kill x number of y", and I even ran into a few game-crashing bugs. Some of that may be simply age -- the game was released in 2007, and I finally played it eight years later -- but it's by no means perfect.\n\nHaving said that, I really did enjoy my time with Geralt of Rivia. While some of the quests in the game are "FedEx" style trips, others are interesting investigations that are both interesting to play and get the player invested in the plot and characters. The game certainly has a story to tell, and is pushing you along that path -- but it's a good story, and one that I quite enjoyed. Sometimes I felt like the game was holding my hand a bit much, telling me where to go or what to do, but other times it let the lore and subtle clues fill in story details or render characters. And the world-builiding and story is really the best thing about this game. The titular character, in particular, is well-done. The game has introduced me to the works of Andrzej Sapkowski, and I look forward to finding out more about Geralt of Rivia in both the novels and CD Projekt RED's follow-up games.","December 21, 2015","true","76.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Let’s get straight to point: I know that most people start playing and leave the game aside after playing for a few minutes. This is mainly because of the combat system which, at first, may seem complicated and hard to get used to. We've all been there, but trust me, a few hours later into the game and you'll be enjoying both the silver/steel and rock/paper/scissors mechanic, as well as the "well-timed clicking" combat system. You'll get used to it in no time! The only complaints I have regarding the game is that it crashed about 6 o 7 times (in 44 hours, which is not that bad at all) and also that the battle against the Hellhound is the hardest one in the whole game. Yes, I know, I should have improved my Aard sign (a "spell" that fus-ro-dahs enemies) but how was I supposed to know that in the first chapter? Once you get pass this battle, you'll just get better and better and no one will stand a chance against you and your Igni sign (a fire spell), basically the best one in the whole game. In fact, I never really had any reason to use any of the spells besides Igni and Aard, even when playing on the hardest difficulty. I also never used bombs or the additional weapons that Geralt can carry. I’m not even sure what they were for, to be honest.\n\nHowever, I really like how they implemented the alchemy system, and how you really need to make use of it to survive. The fact that potions and food aren't consumed "during menus" but in real time is also a good idea that helps you immerse yourself in the game. I love that it’s often necessary to prepare yourself BEFORE battle if you don’t want to die… but the truth is that you’ll only use the same potions again and again, even though there are a bunch of different ones. Yeah, that reminds me of my eternal search for rebis, the basic ingredient for the regeneration potion (swallow). And well, the story is okay. In my opinion it is definitely not a masterpiece as many would say. I heard so many good things about it that I was already expecting a Mass Effect type of story, but it doesn't even come close to that, yet it's also good in it's own right. Maybe it's just... the way in which it’s told, I don't know. To me, most characters felt kind of bland, and I sometimes just read quickly through the dialogues. The fact that both the translation and voice acting were not the best did not help much either. However, I like how detailed the index is and the music is also worth mentioning, as it was always very fitting and unique.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed playing The Witcher and I feel that this is a great classic RPG. You can tell how much effort and dedication the developers have put in making this game. And apart from all this, the Enhanced Edition includes a ton of features like the soundtrack, a comic, wallpapers, making-of videos and keys for a non-DRM copy of the game. I say go for it and give it a try. Just put up with the first hours and you’ll be in for quite a ride. Don’t forget that some decisions, equipment and weapons carry over to the Witcher 2, so you’ll definitely should play this before starting the second if you don’t want to miss anything.

Too bad Geralt get amnesia and forget all his fighting skill, magic and knowledge.\n\nThe witcher is RPG game with lot of things to do and learn,\n\nStory is so good it’s a pure sex, literally.\nEvery quest have story in it.\nYou will have to make a choice, take side, spare or kill which will impact the story later on.\n\nThere is also many interesting things to do. Play dice poker, Fist fight, Hunt monster, Help random people and collect romance cards AKA getting laid.\n\nYou want to have threesome with nurse? Orgy with vempires? Passionate love with sorcerer? This game have it all!!\n\nGraphic is quite good, for old game. The atmosphere and graphic fit the wolrd of witcher nicely.\nMusic are very good too especially boss fight.\n\nGameplay is fun. Combat? Not so much.\nWhen you attack Garelt will perform one set of sword move. When the move end cursor will change and you have to click attack again to make combo. If you click attack before or too late the move will stop. It's not that bad actually after you get used to and quite fun later in the game when you are strong but overall combat feel clunky, unresponsive and can be frustrated.\n\nGameplay is fun and addictive but you will found yourself walking around the map doing quest. Go there, do that kinda thing. No fast travel in this game too. While I find myself enjoy the world and love exploring it. Walking around across the map many times can be boring.\n\nGame mechanics take awhile to get used to. Especially alchemy and crafting.\nThere is a steel sword for fight human and silver sword to fight monster. There is 3 different fighting style for different enemies. There is potions, blade oils, bombs with different effect which you can make and use if you get ingredients. You will have to buy books or find information about each monster and herb to be able to collect it. And many other little thing.\nIt will feel annoying at first but it will be a lot of fun after you get used to it. Too bad that I start to feel fun in the last chapters of the game.\n\nThe witcher may have boring start with it gameplay and story especially if you have play other witcher games before. Give it a try for a few hour first before you decide to uninstaling it.\n\nConclusion  The Witcher overall is a very fun RPG. Rich in story and charecter. Combat might not be the best and game mechanics might be confusing but worth to play and I'm sure you won't regret it.\nIf you interesting in the witcher series from CDPR DO NOT skip this one.\n\nps: sorry for my english.","July 28, 2015","true","50.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It took me awhile to get use to the controls since I'm used to playing with a controller. This game has a rich story, and the choices you take will affect the outcome of the story. I have only unlocked one of the multiple endings, and I'm planning on replaying the game again.  (9/10)","July 30, 2015","true","106.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/QElsa/recommended/20900/","QElsa","Q`Elz","http://steamcommunity.com/id/QElsa/","45 products in account","I'm not a big fan of RPG Games, and i never play the Witcher series either. many reviews said that the Witcher series is a good and amazing RPG games, and with the new game (The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt) been released, i think it's time for me to play the game. bought the first 2 games in Summer sale, and now i've finished the first one (The Witcher Enhanced Edition) and here's my review:\n\nFirst of all, i love the protagonist, Geralt of Rivia, a Witcher, he's one cold-tough-badass-guy, a perfect and efficient killing machine, but sometimes he can be funny too (Like when you meet random people and talk to them, and then you start an awkward conversation). Geralt is also an interesting character, from the beginning of the game, Geralt lost his memories. at first there's nothing special with Geralt, just a Legendary Monster slayer who lost his memories, but as you progress through the game, you'll understand why Geralt is an interesting character.\n\nNext is the other Characters. in every chapters you'll meet new characters, friends and enemies that you'll hate or love. For example, in early game you'll be introduced to Siegfried, a Knight, and you can choose to befriend with him (help him) or just ignore him. I chose to befriend with him and it's worthy, he's one loyal friend. Yes, you can actually choose how to interact with other characters  and it's all about Decisions. Every decisions have impacts on the story, like if you decided to spare someone, he/she will later meet you again and they actually will help you or hate you, so you have to choose wisely.\n\nFor the Story. The story is a little bit cliche, but there are so many surprises in each chapter. All chapters are unique and once you play, you'll be eager to progress to the next chapter (There are 5 chapters in the game). The main quests are interesting but many of the quests are confusing (at least for me), like after you talk to someone the red marker on the map just dissapeared and i have to search on google to find the solution. and for the Side quests, well, some side quests or Contracts are repetitive like you must collect some loots from monsters and deliver them to the quest giver. Also in each chapter there's a trophy monsters that you can hunt, it's fun to hunt them, and the reward is good (Money, You need money in early game, so completing Side Quests/contracts and hunting the trophy monsters is a good idea).\n\nFor the Gameplay. The swordfight is simple, as you just click on the enemy, wait for the cursor to turn red and click again to do a combo attack, but sometimes in a group fight, you'll need to do more than just clicking on enemies, also there are 3 types of attack styles you can use depending on the enemy. you can use Signs (Magic) to help you in a fight, like you can use Aard to stun and allows you to move and plan another attack, or my favorite the Igni, a magic that bursts fire to the enemy and incinerate them.\n\nOverall, i love the game! The story is good (and like i said, so many surprises), the characters are interesting, especially for the Protagonist Geralt, and the gameplay is simple yet challenging.\nWell, my review is not that good compared to others, but i just want to share it here :D","July 27, 2015","true","30.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Pretty fun (if monotonous) gameplay with good roleplaying and characters.  Maybe a little long and slow as 16 hours in I hadn't really done much in terms of real story.  Be ready to set aside upwards of 50 hours to complete the game with some sidequests.","July 26, 2015","true","16.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The combat system is very wonky but once you get the hang of it, it isn't so bad at all, and the story is very good.  Also the choices you make in this game carry over to 2nd game.\n\nAct I, III and IV move along quite well.  Act II, V and Epilogue seem to drag on.\n\nThe alchemy system is a bit confusing but the game tells you what you can make so it isn't too bad.  Level up Igni a lot, it is very powerful, maybe a bit too powerful.\n\nTo answer the question:  Is it worth playing this game or should I just skip to the 2nd game?  The short answer: Yes, play this game!  The long answer: if you are a roleplaying enthusit you will enjoy the many nuances the game has to offer, also Geralt's sense of humor is amazing!  The game is a long one, I clocked over 50 hours on it.","January 22, 2015","true","51.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198016948649/recommended/20900/","76561198016948649","YOSHi","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198016948649/","56 products in account","TLDR: Fantastic game; Combat is not very good but story is absolutely amazing. Graphics great for 2007, obviously lackluster for 2015. Not open world. Play on hardest difficulty, because after chapter 1 game is a cakewalk. Although not needed, (really at all) the story in this game serves to clarify references in the later games and creates a bigger sense of immersion in the game world. 8.5/10 because of combat and lack of challenge.\n\nThis is my Witcher story. I bought Witcher 3 because I wanted a new RPG to play; it was absolutely amazing. I only got through the first chapter and realized that I didn't want the experience to end so quickly so I decided to buy the first one and work my way through that and once done with that play through the second and then eventually move on to finish the third. That's how good this series is, if you're a fan of action RPG's with good stories like me, get the trilogy pack instead of this because if you can bear the combat/graphics (both of which are not THAT bad) of Witcher 1 you will definitely want to play the second and third. You will also enjoy them moreso because you have the background info of the first one.\n\nSo I loaded up Witcher 1 for the low cost of $9.99. First thing I noticed when I started playing the Witcher was the graphics, although extraordinary for 2007, after overclocking my GPU to play the third I was a little disappointed, but you can't ask for much when you backtrack to a game that came out 8 years ago!\n\nThe next thing I noticed was that this game's story is awesome. Cheesily enough, you start off with amnesia. However Geralt's lack of memory serves to push the story forward; Alongside the main conflict in the story, you are trying to find out about Geralt's past through quests and former friends. The best part about the story is that you actually can't wait to find out what happens next. This is the only rpg where I actually read the extra books and lore things you find in the game world because they serve the story so well.  Where most RPG's push for progression by enticing you with new pieces of armor or weapons down the road, the Witcher puts you in a position where you actually want to find out what happens next and you don't really care about much else. However, at times, much of the story is told just by running back and forth and talking to various npcs - there gets to be a point when you want to just go out and smash some monster face. That leads me into one of the only two fair cons to find in this game (because you can't count the graphics of this game as a real con due to its age.)\n\nMy problems with this game are the combat and the lack of challenge. The fights remind me of "Test Your Might" challenges from Mortal Kombat. You just wait until your sword turns yellow and then click, thats it. The whole combat system is click, wait a second or two, click, repeat. there's no real challenge or engagement to it. If you can't kill a monster you just reload and drink more buff potions. When I say there is no challenge to this game, I mean it. I always play games on their hardest difficulty just to feel like I really did beat the game. Even on the most difficult setting, I only had a few times where I struggled at all, and only one time I actually had any real difficulty. Chapter 1's boss fight is the only time I ever found myself struggling. Other than the boring combat and lack of challenge I don't have anything else to really gripe about. I mean the inventory system could have been better and there could have been more applications for alchemy but all in all this is a fantastic game. Sorry for the long winded review.","August 4, 2015","true","65.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
