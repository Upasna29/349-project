Some of the movement triggers feel like hitting notes from Guitar Hero; which was pretty cool. Unfortunately, there wasn't enough to put this game into the thumbs up category.\n\nIt always ruins sports games for me when it's not skill based; meaning once you figure out the moves you can get amazing scores every single time... That's not fun. Also, another killer for me is the audience; no time was spent with this obviously. In a stadium of 50,000 there are only 4 different looking audience members. Even for 2008 that's pretty bad or just lazy. The game will crash if you minimize the screen; and maybe a few other times like it did for me.\n\nThis game could actually be fun if the multiplayer/coop existed in any capacity. Someone must have been pretty high to think this was still worth $20.\n\nActual Value - $1-3ish\n\nAccidently ReviewedWas this review helpful or maybe even not helpful?

This is worse.  I was able to play three events -- high jump, swimming, and 100m dash -- winning the third.\n\nThere's no frame limiter, so it's just running at 800 fps.  Crashed (to desktop) twice the first fifteen minutes.\n\nIt isn't horrible, I'd start it up again, and at least play through every event once, but crashes kill my motivation.  The bottom line is that I'd rather uninstall it than contact tech support.","October 2, 2015","false","0.3"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","2","5","0","0"

This game sucks. The graphics are bad, the career mode is just a list of events that you must play through, but the really bad part is the controls. Note that i have played similar games but those had a much better control design, making those games fun to play. Here, there are plenty of bad choices. Some play better on a keyboard, some on a controller. If you're hardcore, you may enjoy it, but for me the controls kept me away from having a good time. I'm never touching this game again.","October 9, 2015","false","2.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","0"

I try to be the best in all event, and when i complete the goal I leave from game because I don't know what to do anymore. For me most interesting is high jump.\n","March 30","false","4.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
