"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tweevle/recommended/252150/","tweevle","Tweevle","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tweevle/","131 products in account","Grimm (a.k.a American McGee's Grimm) was originally released on GameTap in weekly episodes, and is made by several of the same people who made American McGee’s Alice and Alice: Madness Returns, principle member being American McGee, obviously, but also the writer and one of the main voice actors - more on that later. The artstyle is very stylized and a bit silly, but quite lovely, and it fits the theme very well. The gameplay is simple, but satisfying; a somewhat detailed description of which is below.\n\nThe game stars a filthy, cynical, sadistic dwarf called Grimm (hence the name), who despises the trend of prettying up fairy tales for kids, and makes it his mission to return them back to their dark origins, or at least his own spin on their dark origins. Grimm, along with every other character in the game, is voiced by Roger L. Jackson, whom you may know as the voice of Ghostface (Scream films), Mojo Jojo (the Powerpuff Girls), the Cheshire Cat (McGee's Alice), Anton Sokolov (Dishonored), etc. etc. As such, despite being only one person, the voice acting is varied and top notch, if hammy, and is one of the highlights of the game, along with the well written dialogue and dark sense of humour. The game doesn't take itself very seriously, and it's all the better for that.\n\nGrimm is made up of a series of self-contained episodes that take about half an hour to an hour to complete, each one based on a particular fairy tale, some well-known, others not so much. At the beginning and end of each episode you watch a puppet theatre narrated by Grimm, the first one being a cutesy and inoffensive version of the tale that he picks apart, the latter one being his own, nastier, gruesome take on the tale. These, as with all cutscenes, are skippable. Between these two are a series of levels or "scenes", based on the events of the tale, and it’s here where the meat of the game lies.\n\nGameplay-wise, the game is a fairly simple platformer but with a special mechanic; in every level Grimm has a circular aura around his person that can instantly change objects from their original sugary cuteness, to excessively dark and grotesque. The living creatures and people of the land (referred to as "cleaners"), valiantly try to stave off Grimm's corruption by converting objects back to their lighter selves. Their efforts are pretty much in vein, however, as Grimm can convert objects far more quickly than they do, so they function more as a nuisance than a real threat.\n\nAs Grimm converts more objects, he becomes more powerful, which is represented in-game by his "Dark-o-Meter". Gaining levels in the Dark-o-Meter gives Grimm a larger aura, allows him to jump higher and run faster, and most importantly, convert bigger objects and eventually the cleaners themselves, which renders them powerless. To progress through each level, Grimm must convert certain indicated objects to their dark equivalents, which usually requires filling up the Dark-o-Meter to a certain point. There is no fail state, and though Grimm can die through environmental hazards such as water, he respawns immediately and there is no penalty for dying, so playing through the game is a fairly straightforward and relaxed affair, though there are medals available for speedrunning levels, if you're into that sort of thing.\n\nSome episodes spice things up by introducing powerups, and some levels are more platforming-heavy than others, but other than that the gameplay is pretty much the same throughout the series. One might think this could get boring fast (and for some it might do), but in my opinion it's kept fresh by the sheer variety of objects that can be converted. Every single character, object, and piece of the environment has a light and dark variant, and each episode has its own original setting which introduces a lot of new ones. Much of the fun comes from seeing how each new cutesy object/character warps into a twisted and disgusting parody of its former self (and if you manage to collect all the "secrets" hidden in an episode's levels, you can see the episode's Gallery, which allows you to look closely at light and dark variations of every object from any angle).\n\nThere's also something viscerally satisfying about the way Grimm converts things; as your power increases you may begin to feel like a perverse demigod as the land curdles all around you, and the fact everyone is powerless to stop you and you cannot be killed just adds to that. It's fun to look back at your handiwork at the end of each level and see how almost unrecognisable the land is from its former self.\n\nAs for the negatives, the gameplay is, as said, simple, and may be too much so for some people. The game was made quickly and on a budget, and it shows - the animation is often quite stiff and there's a certain lack of polish, but fortunately the artstyle makes this not too much of an issue, and it does improve somewhat as the series goes on. While the voice acting is good, it can get rather repetitive at times, as can the music, although each episode has a different soundtrack which prevents you getting too sick of it. Camera is serviceable but a little restrictive; I would have preferred to be able to look up and around a bit more to see things, as that's the focus of the game, though in the later episodes a new wider camera option is added that helps with that. The fact that it's in episodic format results in some oddities, such as later episodes having slightly more features, and settings (e.g. screen resolution) not being transferred between episodes, so you have to re-set them each time you play a new episode. Finally, there may not be a massive amount of replayability once you've been through each episode, unless you wish to get the timed medals and/or find every secret. None of these negatives have been a major problem for me, though.\n\nSo, to sum up, if you're only looking for deep, strategic and/or very difficult gameplay, this game probably isn't for you. If you'd enjoy a more laid-back experience that you can dip in and out of, enjoy black humour, and perhaps have a passing interest in fairy tales, you could do a lot worse than Grimm.","January 8, 2014","true","10.5"," 86 of 98 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","86","98","0","1"

The gameplay and controlls are very easy to pick up. You play as Grimm, whose goal it is to make everything around him nasty and turn happy people into rotten ones. You do this by simply walking around. As you do that your stink power will grow and allow you to turn bigger and bigger objects into smelly ones and later even the people. But you have to be careful, the good people are out to clean up your mess.\n\nThe game is well animated and the voice-acting fitting. The only problem I encountered was repeatedly getting temporarily stuck on invisible objects and borders.\n\nThe creators have repeatedly stated that because they no longer have access to the game source they will not add achievements to this game. This also means that there will be no further episodes added or problems fixed (smoothing out objects edges so as to not get stuck), so don't expect anything on that front.\n\nAll in all a really fun and easy game for teenagers and adults looking for a short break.","May 20, 2015","true","4.0"," 38 of 47 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","38","47","0","0"

A smelly, cynical dwarf who's deceptively immature with his love for purile humor and fart jokes. But he's actually intelligent, using complex words and even speaking Mandarin Chinese in one particular Fairytale.\n\nYou run around some famous (and some rather obscure) fairytales, your existence itself causing the world to become corrupt and rigid, all in the name of returning the fairytales to their rightful state. There's where one gripe of mine comes in. You don't actually turn things into how they were supposed to be. In the original Little Red Riding Hood, Red Riding Hood actually eats her own mother, that never happens in this game. You rather turn them into dark parodies, which kind of ruins the entire purpose.\n\nNevertheless, turning fairytales into dark, disturbing, and metal as hell wastelands is pretty entertaining. Theres an upwards of thousand of different object transformations to keep it from being stale. It even brings variations on the darkening to keep things especially fresh (Like in King Midas when you turn everything into gold).\n\nThe animations are very primitive, you can tell this was made on a budget. And the cleaners are the most annoying things you will ever encounter. But buy this game anyway, it's loads of fun for what it's worth. I hope to see a sequel...\n\nMay all our stories end so well!

It hailed from the once cheerful and joyous kindgom of Gametappington. The Kingdom of Gametappington however was overcome with a blight, and chaos soon took over, when the original king was slain, and the kingdom was soon taken over by the evil king Metaboli. Metaboli ruled with an iron fist, and took all the fun and cheer away from the once joyous kingdom of Gametappington. And with that, Grimm was locked away, soon to be long forgotten.\n\nWell one day, a kingdom on the other side of the world, known as the kingdom of Steamtopia, ruled by our mighty lord Gaben, began amassing an army of indie titles under the recruitment orders of Sir Greenlight of Steamptopia. Grimm of the kingdom of Gametappington had escaped the clutches of the evil king Metaboli, and fled clear across the globe. Along his voyage to freedom, he worked for various traders to seek employment. But he had one goal in mind. Steamtopia. So he continued his trek to Steamtopia, seeking refuge as his endgame. And one day, he arrived at the gates. But he had to prove himsewlf worthy first. Sir Greenlight of Steamtopia saw potential in this little episodic trooper, and gave it a chance. But he let the citizens of Steamtopia decide its fate, much like all of its other soldiers of the Greenlight army. The citizens of Steamtopia liked this new Grimm. They welcomed him in with open arms. And henceforth it is with great pleasure to announce the forever citizenship of Greenlight Knight Grimm of Steamtopia!\n\nGrimm is an episodic game series, much like another Gametap original you all know as Sam & Max Season 1, which has made it's way to Steam. It's a pretty nifty little title. Simple, yet adorably gruesome if that makes any sense. Each episode, which is covered over 3 seasons, with 23 episodes in total, starts out cute and innocent enough, but ends with some sadistic retellings of beloved tales from the brothers Grimm.\n\nIt is definitely a game intended for kids. But I would not go as far as saying little kids. there is blood, and there is gore. But it is no worse than what you may see on an episode of The Simpsons Treehouse of Horror, or any regular episode of Family Guy. But parents beware, you may want to check out the game first before letting any little ones play it. That said, it can still be enjoyable for adults. It does have some decent humor even we can enjoy.\n\nThe gameplay is simple. You control a warped and twisted version of Grimm, who is fed up with how cute the fairy tale stories have become, and he wants to give them a good kick in the rear with a dark and disgusting makeover. So each episode has Grimm walking around, jumping, and stomping chaos into everything. As he corrupts more of the area, his dark-o-meter fills up, and the more bars he gets, the wider the radius of his corruption becomes. There are some characters who will be immune to the dark corruption, but as more bars get filled, even they succumb to the darkness. But before they succumb, they can erase the darkness with their own small radius, as they walk around. But they are more of a small bother than a real threat, and can be easily worked around.\n\nThere is not really much challenge in any of the levels, and each episode can be beaten in roughly 30 to 45 minutes tops, even taking your time. With 23 episodes in total, that is not too bad of a full gameplay length. But don't expect any huge leaps in gameplay with each episode. It's pretty much, walk around, corrupt, and butt stomp! That said, this game is more for the humorous story retellings than anything else.\n\nEach episode starts with a short cinematic showing the cute version of the fairytale, and ends with the newly improved dark and twisted version. You'll find retellings of such faiytales as Red Riding Hood, Cinderella, Pinnochio, Snow White, and more.\n\n\n\nAll in all, worth the $9.99","February 15, 2014","true","4.5"," 28 of 35 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","28","35","0","5"

That's really what you should take away about Grimm. Aesthetically, the game is delightful, and while the direction it goes in storytelling is... bizarre, it's not bad, but the actual gameplay - which is a mix of Katamari Damacy with some extremely basic 3D platforming - bogs it down completely into a mess of repetition and tedium. Essentially they took the basic gameplay of Katamari, completely missed what made it good, and ended up with the mess that we see here.\n\nAdmittedly, even some of the later actual Katamari games managed to miss what made Katamari Damacy fun in places, but that hardly makes this excusable. Absent the progression provided by being able to pick up steadily larger objects, the entire game is just running around, watching things turn dark and dirty in your wake, and very occasionally jumping. It's incredibly dull, and it's a shame because everything else about this has potential.\n\nThere's been cases where I've stood up rather strongly for games that lack conventional gameplay, such as the excellent The Path, but this is a very different case from that. It's not that Grimm lacks gameplay in a traditional sense, it's that it has it and it's extraordinarily repetitive and unengaging. They could have just actually cloned Katamari in it's entirety and this would have been pretty damn great, but instead we ended up with this half-baked mess of a game. If there was any doubt, not recommended.\n\nAlso, while it's not a factor in this review, seriously guys - don't nag someone about the fact that they're playing the free episode when they own some of the paid ones. I have the entire series from a bundle and it's slightly annoying to get little nags in something that I spent money on and own.","May 22, 2015","false","0.5"," 46 of 68 people (68%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","68","46","68","0","4"

I was introduced to McGee, as a game maker, back in 2001 with American McGee's Alice, which took a dark retelling of the Lewis Carol story, Alice in Wonderland. The official sequel of the game was released just a few years ago, and can be found here on steam.\n\nBack to what we were originally talking about--- THIS game. Grimm takes that same little twist that you expect with anything made by McGee, but does it in a humorous, yet demented way. He takes the popular childrens tales, and tells them the way they were originally told in, with nothing sugar coated or laced with wool. Let this also be known, that the game features hangings, as well as various other scenes that are not meant for small children, and while the game's graphics could be aesthetically pleasing towards said audience, the game is best suited towards teenagers and adults.\n\nIn this game, you play as Grimm, a cranky storyteller, who dislikes the fact that fairy tales have lost their cautionary warnings and dark overtones and means to retell each story the way they were originally told in. He/You do this by spreading filth and darkness throughout each scene and butt stomping everything until nothing is sugar coated. Each episode (there are 30 in total) takes roughly 30 minutes of gameplay, can be played in any order, and currently the first episode is free to play.\n\nVisuals and Sounds\n\nThe graphics in this game could be considered “cutesy” and childlike but I find them aesthetically pleasing and while they lean on the side of childlike, have that little twist that only American McGee could do. Moreso, I found it pleasing to watch the overall changes within the scenes and areas after you  managed to create enough filth and darkness to “butt stomp away”.\n\nThere are some minor issues with clipping in certain areas, but given the price tag for each episode, are a relatively small and minor detail.\n\nThe voice acting in this game, especially with the character of Grimm are very well done and fit into the worldstates that each story is told in. The point of this game is a narrative gameplay, and each narration is unique with its own sense of humor.\n\nAs I said above in the last section, the game may look like it's targeted towards small children, but its mature tones make the game better suited towards teenagers and adults.\n\nThe Gameplay\n\nThe gameplay is rather simple, easy to learn, but unfortunately gets repetitive. Keep in mind that this game isn't really about the gameplay itself, it's about the narration and the changing of the tones of each story. There are some stories where you will need to occasionally jump onto platforms and avoid things like water and lava, but that is more about timing your jumps from each platform/from platform to land.\n\nUnfortunately, the repetitive gameplay is a real shame for this game because it has decent potential to be better than some of the newer, shinier, 3d platforming titles. Add this to the fact that the game has no way to save your progress, and you get a slightly disappointed feeling... or at least I did.\n\nThe Recommendation\n\nI recommend this game to anyone who enjoys games with fun little dark twists, who enjoy American McGee games, and who like the idea of short playtime episodes. The first episode is free, and the rest of the episodes occasionally get thrown into bundles, but are cheap as standalone options on steam. While there were some things about the gameplay for me, this should in no way detract people from managing to have a fun playthrough of the game. I also recommend playing the first episode if you are still unsure and don't want to spend $3.99 per “season” of the DLCs.","August 21, 2015","true","8.5"," 25 of 34 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","25","34","0","2"

It's different. I think that's the best way to put it, it's just different and that difference makes it refreshing. I'm not saying it's the game to end all games but it's something that's worth a look at if you enjoy dark, morbid humor. The art style presented in this game works for what it's trying to do. Something about the bright, oddly shaped characters is actually really appealing and, personally, I never get tired of seeing what kind of macabre stuff things turn into. A cute little deer running around? Nope, now it's cut in half and flailing around helplessly - it's really freakin' creepy and yet still brought a smile to my face. Each story (which there are 23 of) has 5 to 6 scenes to play out and there are a couple of collectibles hidden around the areas: collecting all 10 for a story unlocks the art gallery. You can also get a medal for turning everything dark 100% but beyond that there's not much to do. The game mechanic of going around and turning everything into a dark version of itself can and probably will get tedious to some, there are no enemies to fight and very little threat to Grimm besides water/lava and the Cleaners that come around to clean up your darkness, which aren't so much a threat as they are an annoyance but you can stun them for a couple of seconds. It does have some movement flaws and glitches where I found myself stuck on a tree and unable to jump or running in to an invisible wall after doing a Buttstomp and I have to say Grimm repeats his lines way too much, but besides that it's a pretty sturdy game. Certainly not going to be for everyone and you can probably feel like you're getting a better deal for it if it goes on sale, but if you're interested in seeing your favorite childrens' story turn in to a horrific nightmare  then I think American McGee and Spicy Horse did a fantastic job in delivering.","January 7, 2014","true","8.2"," 20 of 29 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","20","29","0","0"

In this game, you play as Grimm, a gross little imp-like man who wants to turn all Fairy Tales back to their gruesome originals. To do this, you simply walk through each scene, dirtying up everything around you. Your main weapon is "butt-stomping", which dirties up larger areas than simply walking. There are also special power ups such as "Flaming Pee" and "Sausage Stomp", just to name two.\n\n\nLong Review:\n\nStory - There are over 20 different episodes in the game. Each one depicts a different Fairy Tale. Most you'll recognise, but there are a few obscure ones that you may or may not have heard of. Each episode starts off by showing the "light" version of the Fairy Tale, where Grimm points out all of its flaws. After you've finished dirtying up everything, the "dark" version plays.\n\nGraphics - The graphics are cartoony and several assets (random people, princesses, and such) are reused from one story to another. The best part about the graphics are how they change from "cutesy" to "grimm".\n\nMusic/Sounds - The sound fx are pretty good in this game and the music (especially the music that plays when the game is on pause) is very catchy. I've actually caught myself humming it when out doing shopping.\n\nLength - Each episode lasts over an hour, if you watch both the light and dark cinematics. They can be skipped by pressing the SPACE button however. If you skip them, and play quickly through the episode, then each one will last roughly 30-40 minutes.\n\nReplayability - There are lots of "secrets" (coins) which can be found in each episode as well as the potiential to earn gold stars for turning everything in each scene dark, so there is a bit of replayability in this game if you don't manage to do everything the first time through.\n\nOverall, if you're the type of person who enjoys immature humour (fart jokes) and cartoony depictions of violence, and you like games which don't really take themselves very seriously, you would probably enjoy this game. It does have a few problems with camera angles which are quite annoying in places, so you may want to wait until the game goes on sale to get it.","November 22, 2014","true","13.9"," 14 of 18 people (78%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","78","14","18","2","0"

Grimm takes the boring and safe modern versions of the Grimm Brothers tales and other wimpified stories and turns them into episodic set pieces for the player to play through, turning them back into the dark, dismal and macabre moral stories they were originally intended to be. Despite many technical limitations and drawbacks, Grimm has keen writing and a fairly unique gameplay style and with great source material and in good old fashioned Spicy Horse Games' style, turns it into something wacky and fun.\n\nHighlights\nGrimm is worth noticing because of its unique gameplay style, strangeness and storytelling. When reduced to simpler terms it's probably best described as a 3D platformer with a collect/complete mechanism similar to that of the Katamari titles, but with a stronger focus on storytelling and writing, and boy does the writing shine. With source material like Grimm it's hard to go wrong, but as this game tries to show, due to modern safety, mass appeal and 'Disneyfication', we often do. Using exuberant writing and matching it with the macabre mix of childish wonder in the characters and an equally childish mucky & disgusting art style in the set pieces, it really brings the Grimm tales and other story pieces to life while still holding enough fun gameplay value to catch the attention of anyone who might not familiar with the stories and tales.\n\nMistakes & Annoyances\nAt nearly 8 years old at the time of review, and built in Unreal Engine 3, Grimm is still very enjoyable and due to the catoonish style the graphics haven't aged as poorly as you'd expect. Yet it does still feel like dated artefacts in low budget set pieces. But I think this is a more personal thing and if you like the simplified art style of other Spicy Horse games then you'll have no big issue with the graphics or art style.\n\nThe small design flaws and technological failures however are abundant, especially in the earlier episodes, and range across the board from minor things like lack of controller support on the launcher, strange limited resolution options, no launcher resulting in manually having to set the resolution and other settings again and again for each of the 23 episodes, to more obstacle causing problems like crashing every time you Alt-Tab out of the game, gameplay freezing, launch errors and plenty more.\n\nMany of these problems are bluntly addressed in the Discussion threads as unfixable due to the source code having been lost along with many other company artefacts due to a lightning strike and power loss, and as always the Community has found and posted many relevant fixes and useful information, but it's still reason for pause when considering a purchase if you're on the fence.\n\nRecommendations\nPriced at just $9.99/8.99€ for the Complete Pack at the time of review, and STILL unavailable in the UK due to problems with Steam Store integration, it's best to try Episode 1 - A Boy Learns What Fear Is which is available directly from the store page for free (and includes access to the trading cards without imbursement). The first episode is pretty representational of the 22 others, and if you enjoy the gameplay, story or writing enough to try out the other episodes then the Complete Pack is the most sensible option. All episodes can be played for free, but since the Episodes and Seasons are both overpriced when compared to the Complete Pack this option doesn't make much sense, though for those on a budget it's worth noting that the latter seasons are far better and Season Two is probably the best of the three.\n\nDue, presumably, to the limitations of the Steam Store, this title never goes on sale on Steam, but has been included in bundles for as little as $1 for the Complete Pack, so looking around for a better deal may well be a better option, but even at $10 and even with the technical problems and other issues, this is still a strong recommendation for anyone with a grammatical fondness or anyone looking for something a bit out of the norm.\n\n* The First episode is available for free and includes trading card drops. It's a great way to test whether you'll enjoy this title\n* Grimm has been made available on Windows phones via GestureWorks https://gameplay.gestureworks.com/virtual_controllers/9791-grimm\n* Collecting all the secrets gives reason to play through another few times and reveals the light and dark versions of several gameplay elements in a gallery\n* There are a number of interesting, detailed and blunt replies to various questions from the developers in the forums including those from American himself\n","April 8","true","6.0"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

It's also dark, and some people of a certain religious or moral persuasion really won't like it. There's a reason for the darkness and moral ambiguity, though, which I'll expand on later.\n\nYou play a character named Grimm, whose mission is to restore the 21st century versions of fairy tales to their original medieval purpose. This involves removing as much pink and shiny “niceness” as possible, and replacing it with darkness and corruption.

On the one hand, given the current moral panic over the effects of computer games, I can understand. But on the other hand, isn't it just that censorship that the game seeks to address?\n\nAnyway, it's an enjoyable game, and very thought provoking.\n\nI apologise for this next section. It started as a review, but became an essay. I'm concerned that some people who have written about this game don't understand the history or purpose behind it.\n\nThe stories we now know as “fairy tales” were largely based on folk tales current in 16th and 17th century Europe. The stories, however, are in many cases much older. They captured people's imagination, and were passed down orally from generation to generation, because they performed a valuable teaching function. They warned people of the dangers out there. They were not originally intended for children, and many of them explore extremely violent, sexual and disturbing themes.\n\nFor instance, the oldest known version of “Sleeping Beauty” is “Sole, Luna, e Talia” recorded by Giambattista Basile, published in 1634. In this story, the handsome prince does not kiss Beauty to wake her. Instead, he rapes her while she's unconscious, and then departs, apparently without a thought. Leaving her still comatose, but now also pregnant with twins.\n\nIn the original version of “Red Riding Hood”, there's no granny, no cottage, and no huntsman. There's just a little girl, alone in the forest, and a wolf. And it kills her, and eats her. She doesn't get rescued, there's no happy ending, she's dead.\n\n19th century writers such as the Brothers Grimm and Hans Christian Andersen recounted many of these stories. But, in keeping with the moral code of their time, completely removed the sexual references, and greatly toned down the violence. Even so, this sanitisation was nowhere near enough for 20th century moralists. Disney is an easy target here, but Disney are far from alone in further Bowdlerising the stories to the point where they're fluffy, happy, and completely inoffensive. The problem is that the modern versions of these stories are also totally meaningless, and devoid of any of the original teaching. “And they all lived happily ever after” is a modern lie. It's not true now, and in 1600 no-one would have been stupid enough to say it.\n\nThat's what American McGee is getting at here – these stories were originally extremely nasty, but deliberately so.

You play as the evil dwarf named Grimm, and his mission is to change cute and happy fairy tales into dark and twisted stories. The gameplay is very simple, running, jumping and occasionally butt stomping. The goal is to turn everything around you into a dark wasteland in order to progress with altering tales such as Little Red Riding Hood, A Christmas Carol, Pinnochio, Cinderella, Jack and the Banstalk, and many other tales. Each episode opens up with a cutscene to showcase the stories Light Theater with it's cute and cuddly characters, after completing each mission of an episode, you'll be able to watch the Dark Theater mode to see Grimm's version of the tale. Some episodes include power ups such as high jump, super butt stomp, flaming pee, and others. Each episode has a collection of Secret Tokens, collecting them al will unlock the Gallery and view both the light and dark versions of props and sets of each episode, too bad it doesn't show the character models. The only issue I had with this game is being stuck inbetween obsticales which can be annoying, there's only been a few times I had to leave the chapter and come back to it and not get stuck. The first episode if free to play to give people an idea on how the game is like, while the other episodes cost about 1 dollar each, as there are 23 Episodes total. This is more of a different game than most of Mcgee's titles, as this relies more on the artstyle and whitty dialouge with Grimm and the fairy tale creatures. It's also amazing that Roger L. Jackson voices every frikkin character in this game, even in the Mulan episode where he speaks in chinese gibbirish. The last event in the last episode, Snow White, is an epic and fitting end to the series. So if your in the mood for some more mature versions of classic fairy tales with it's simple gameplay, hilarous writting, and interesting art style, this game is worth a play for one of those slow days when you have nothing better to do. May all our stories end so well. Until next time.","February 21, 2014","true","61.6"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

Just terrible.  First and foremost, American McGee's Grimm is not a game.  Rather it's poorly executed animated cartoon with limited interactivity.  There's so much potential but incomplete bits and pieces of this that I don't even know where to begin.  It's not an action adventure game.  There's hardly any action aside from literally spreading grime with your ♥♥♥♥ around the game world and the occasional stomp.  The gameplay mechanics as noted above are very straightforward so it's easy to pick up for a younger audience.\n\nI could get into the more technical nuances of the execution of the game but the little gameplay offered makes those remarks a minor issue.\n\nFurthermore, the content and nature of the game may unsuitable for young children who'd be the folk who'd find the gameplay fun.  The story telling and cinematics however are well done technically but there's no substance to it.  I don't really care for what it is being told. The story telling doesn't necessarily grab you and leave you wanting to see and hear more.  There's no spur.  However that remark is highly subjective as others may find the stories amusing.  Which is surprising as I have and do love many works from the Grimm Brothers.\n\nAesthetically?  It's great.  It's pleasing to the eye.\n\nIt's a stretch to call American McGee's Grimm a game.  If you're a fan of the Grimm's Fairy Tales lore and want to experience them in the McGee aesthetic then give it a try, Episode One is available free.  Otherwise, save your time I did the buttstomping for you.","June 12, 2014","false","0.5"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

You start fouling smaller objects first and then move on to bigger things as your vileness increases, like a Katamari of filth and Jhonen Vasquez. The game is split into 23 small episodes (maybe 30 minutes each) which all have separate settings files which they randomly ignore so you have to tweak stuff like resolution and audio many times. Tech-wise it's like a bad port (even though it seems to be originally a PC title) and the gameplay isn't very deep. The stories and events are funny enough if you like peeing on people and having skulls and corpses pop up from everywhere. If I'd paid full price for this I'd probably be annoyed but if you can get it cheap (from a certain bundle for example) it's just about okay. This is a just-barely-recommendation and only because I like the cartoony style and depravity.\n\nPost-completion edit: Having played the rest of the episodes I'm changing this to a "don't buy". It's okay as a freebie but after you've played about 5 of the episodes you've had your fun, the later episodes are just wearing the same joke super-thin with repetitive rehashed levels and bad platforming where you get glitched and have to start all over.

There came a point, though, where I realized I was trying too hard--even forcing myself--to identify any good qualities in the game, so I gave up.\n\nPros:\n-Familiar McGee-style dark twist on storytelling\n-Intuitive gameplay\n-Serialized with a free first chapter so you only pay for what you want\n\nCons:\n-Abysmal soundtrack and voice acting\n-Gratuitous bathroom humor\n-No achievements to incentivize replaying levels for better scores\n-Being constantly told what to do\n-Storytelling gimmick backfires\n\nIt's hard to tell who the target audience is. If it was meant for adults to remind them that Disney-style fairy tales are inaccurate and cloying, then they spent too much time dumbing-down the gameplay for pre-school-aged players. Not only is there no need for the game to pause every few seconds to cut-scene and point out the next objective, there's something quite patronizing about GRIMM constantly breaking the 4th wall to bark commands at the player with his raspy voice. ALL. THE. TIME.\n\nYes, I know where to perform a butt-stomp! Be quiet and let me drive!\n\nSadly, that raspy voice is the best voice acting available. Every other voice is poorly selected and poorly recorded. It's hard to say which is worse, though, the grating voices or the monotonous, background music. After ten minutes, you might be inclined to turn off all sound to attempt to salvage an enjoyable moment.\n\nWhat most interested me in this title was the promise that we would be able to return watered-down, happily-ever-afters to their dark, twisted roots. What we got was a device to spread a lot of flatulence and to transform cutesy, pop-up style art into a different shade of cutesy, pop-up style art. Seriously, the changes you make in the game are almost as adorable as the bunnies, flowers, and rainbows left behind.\n\nBut that's okay, right, because at the end of each chapter, Grimm's there to give us a synopsis of what we changed and how it improved the story. I think that was the plan, but it lacks any moral or big reveal and exists only for Grimm to eke out a final fart joke.\n\nDisappointing.","November 30, 2015","false","0.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Every week, a new episode of this game would come out. Now, all 23 episodes are on steam in one big bundle.\n\nYou play as Grimm, a person who's clearly never been in a shower, who despises fairy tales. So he goes around to random fairy tales to make them darker and nastier. The gameplay mainly stays consistent through all the episodes. There's some platforming, which is usually pretty easy. The main focus of the game is to turn everything into dark stuff, by simply walking up to it. It's simple, and will get repetitive playing all of it. I played the first episode and already I could feel the repetition setting in. At least the gameplay is pretty fun, though.\n\nA few issues I have with this game is that it's pretty ugly. I don't really complain about graphics, but jesus, Unreal Engine 3 hasn't looked this bad in a while. It's an older game, but still, it looks like an Unreal Engine 1 game, and that isn't really a good thing. The game runs pretty well on my bad rig, however. The controls are really simple and easy to use, but I was not a fan of the camera angle. I know it's supposed to show you more of the area, but it was confusing for me and I got a nice dose of motion sickness after finishing the first episode because of motion blur ♥♥♥♥.\n\nNow, should you buy Grimm? Yes, but if you don't like repetition, then don't. The gameplay is fun, but you can get sick of it. There's a lot of content, with 23 episodes clocking in at 30-60 minutes each, depending on how you play. You could do the bare minimum and just do your objectives, or you could darken every little thing and find the secrets. There's a lot for a cheap price, but don't expect this game to be as good as previous American McGee games (like Alice, Scrapland).\n\nFinal rating is: Why not It's not half bad/6.8\n","February 8, 2014","true","0.7"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Grimm gathers a bunch of our favorite old school fairy tales and drags them through the blood and bile to turn them into something vile and disgusting. You play the role of "Grimm" a small dark-looking man who's sole purpose is to make things as terrible as possible. The entire point of this game is to run around and corrupt things with your devious aura and make things in the story go from cute to creepy. I often find that his hat is the most interesting part of this character and I cannot for the life of me figure out why he's not wearing a shirt.\n\nWhen I was playing the first episode, it was not all that bad. The story was kind of interesting and the gameplay was simple if not completely shallow. But every episode after that I felt a growing sense of "okay let's just get this over with" and just toughed it out.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/epeternally/recommended/252150/","epeternally","Princess","http://steamcommunity.com/id/epeternally/","2703 products in account","The basic gameplay loop isn't engaging. That's really what you should take away about Grimm. Aesthetically, the game is delightful, and while the direction it goes in storytelling is... bizarre, it's not bad, but the actual gameplay - which is a mix of Katamari Damacy with some extremely basic 3D platforming - bogs it down completely into a mess of repetition and tedium. Essentially they took the basic gameplay of Katamari, completely missed what made it good, and ended up with the mess that we see here.\n\nAdmittedly, even some of the later actual Katamari games managed to miss what made Katamari Damacy fun in places, but that hardly makes this excusable. Absent the progression provided by being able to pick up steadily larger objects, the entire game is just running around, watching things turn dark and dirty in your wake, and very occasionally jumping. It's incredibly dull, and it's a shame because everything else about this has potential.\n\nThere's been cases where I've stood up rather strongly for games that lack conventional gameplay, such as the excellent The Path, but this is a very different case from that. It's not that Grimm lacks gameplay in a traditional sense, it's that it has it and it's extraordinarily repetitive and unengaging. They could have just actually cloned Katamari in it's entirety and this would have been pretty damn great, but instead we ended up with this half-baked mess of a game. If there was any doubt, not recommended.\n\nAlso, while it's not a factor in this review, seriously guys - don't nag someone about the fact that they're playing the free episode when they own some of the paid ones. I have the entire series from a bundle and it's slightly annoying to get little nags in something that I spent money on and own.","December 19, 2014","false","1.9"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tawnylawns/recommended/252150/","tawnylawns","Tawny Lawns 💗","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tawnylawns/","1729 products in account","Episode 1. "A Boy Learns What Fear Is" of American McGee's Grimm was free so I decided to give it a go on both PC and laptop.\n\nTL;DR – Cute, basic/easy game with mildly entertaining characters and stories. Will bore the average adult gamer. Is good for mindless “butt-stomping”.\n\nGrowing up I came across a series of books by Japanese author, Misao Kiryu (桐生操) titled roughly along the lines of The Horrible Truth Behind Grimms' Fairy Tales. I think they're officially known by the Japanese title Honto wa osoroshii Gurimu dowa (本當は恐ろしいグリム童話) or Dreadful in Truth.  As there are probably only Japanese and Korean versions available (unfortunate 'cos they're a great read), chances are they’re unfamiliar titles but this is what sprang to mind when I ran this game. They're three volumes filled with the re-telling of famous Grimms' Fairy Tales with a very sinister twist. In Kiryu's books, Snow White is r*ped by King Dad (incest), her knight in shining armour asks to buy Snow White's sleeping body thinking it is a corpse (necrophilia), Cinderella goes right to home base the night she meets Prince Charming at the ball (fornication), Sleeping Beauty was also r*ped/"pricked finger on spindle" and the guy she ends up with either likes transvestites or is a closeted gay(?) because he'll only bed her in men's attire and Rapunzel locked in her tower was a pr*stitute, Dame Gothel(the witch), her pimp. I could go on, it was three volumes after all but instead I'll leave you with some articles in English to quench any morbid curiosity.\n\nThere's quite a bit of truth in the pages of Kiryu's series as many of the delightful stories we heard growing up were originally made to scare all into fear and wariness against the outside world. Brutality, sexual content, wicked villainy and death were all too common. There are plenty of materials on the "actual" fairy tales. For some interesting reading that may ruin the stories you have come to love, Emily Temple's article[flavorwire.com] (2012 piece) is a beginner's paradise.\nGrimm isn’t as hardcore but is basically a watered-down version.\n\nGrimm contains playful animation and cheeky puns with a somewhat stimulating story along with an abundance of cinematics between plays. It’s like an interactive storybook where the controls remind me of a beginner’s version of Super Mario 64. The graphics run smoothly on my low grade HP laptop but with it being such a colourful and detailed game, it obviously looks better displayed on a bigger monitor. I’m sure it could keep a toddler pretty happy for a few minutes, which is saying a lot. The first time I was bored and downloaded the game on my BF’s PC, skipped all the stories, just concentrating on progression. Then I started getting stuck in places where I’d have to jiggle my way out until at one point after a few scenes I couldn’t do it anymore and was completely stuck. I had to force close the game and left it at that.\n\nWhen I came back to it a second time I used my laptop, which is a feeble thing that cannot run high performance games but luckily did fine with Grimm. You can control Grimm using a keyboard/mouse or both and it’s spectacularly easy to familiarise yourself with. If you’re used to FPS games, using a mouse will add fluidity but if you’re easily nauseous as I am, stick to the keyboard and it’ll be buckets more pleasant. :)\n\nTip 1: The game is ambiguous with instructions when “butt-stomping” at designated points in the Grimm world. When you play, you’re filling up the Dark-O-Meter at the top of the screen to the indicated goal first. Then, and only then can you butt-stomp under the butt-stomp arrow. It appears before you need it so when I didn’t comprehend this at the start I was stomping like mad under the arrow trying to figure out how to progress. :P\n\nOn my laptop I decided to go through the whole thing and listen to the story properly. It was surprisingly thought-provoking. Grimm the dwarf doesn’t like naïve, happy things and thinks children should know the truth about “the dark side of the moon” instead. Yet he’s a likeable character with a quirky, macabre sense of humour that seems misanthropic on the outside and philanthropic on the inside.\n\nOnce you finish watching the initial introduction (you can skip all the cinematics though I advise against it as it is half the fun) you have the choice between the Light Theatre and Dark Theatre. 6 scenes await you, each averaging 3 minutes. The faster you finish each scene, the better. You/Grimm are in a delightful little kingdom where everyone is dancing, joyful and ecstatic to clean stuff. You must walk, jump and best of all, “butt-stomp” on everything and anything and turn the scenery dreary, the people menacing, and practically just everything apocalyptic. There’s more to the actual story in each episode. In episode 1 Grimm wants the player to discover the meaning of fear in both an overtly depressing light (Light Theatre) and a positively realistic manner (Dark Theatre). Which is actually a refreshingly enlightened point of view for both adults and children alike.\n\nTip 2: It proves helpful not to skip the shorter clips between games that show you what you should do next or you may get lost. Also, use butt-stomping like crazy to save time.\n\nSo now I’m thinking, it isn’t that bad and could be pretty educational. But then come words like fondle and butt-stomping on top of things can kill dogs you’ve brought to the dark side into a splatter of red meat flying all over the darn screen while gleeful villagers awaiting execution are turned into hanging corpses. At this point it’s confusing to tell if Grimm was made for a target audience of children, adults or kidults. The attention to detail is imaginative enough and I kept a watch out for how different objects in the game “turned” albeit usually not being one to dwell on surrounding graphics/illustration. But I have a niece and nephew, ages 3 and 4 and I wouldn’t let them play this. It might be good, simple fun for adults who think dark things are cute.\n\nWhen all is said and done, it’s still an entertaining game and well made apart from a few glitches/bugs. It is mainly concerned with the controls such as the accuracy of the hovering butt-stomp arrows failing the player, at times making it difficult to find the right spot to place your final butt-stomp. This causes the player to re-start a scene completely to get past the bug. It froze once but I can’t be sure it was the game’s fault or my lack of a proficient processor. As mentioned, crevices or cracks I’d get stuck in were tiresome. I had to give up on this game and pick it up again three times (PC/laptop) because of various problems.\n\nNo part of it was even close to so awful that I disliked it but the bugs got to me substantially and to vote up a game I’m uninterested in buying feels deceptive to me so here I am writing both good and bad and then telling you not to bother. If you’re interested in trying the demo, go for it. Relatively, it’s a cheap game and great quality for the price. I just can’t figure out the objective for adults playing this game. It lacks an addictive quality and has some mildly educational merits that would rarely interest a grown up. It’s darkly sweet but it’d be like buying an ornamental ceramic bunny for my dressing table and just looking at it from time to time. I actually feel pretty satisfied after reading Wikipedia’s episode list for Grimm[en.wikipedia.org] and feel like I’ve had my fill of light, gothic, storytelling.\n\nEdit: format","February 28, 2015","false","2.7"," 9 of 19 people (47%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","47","9","19","0","0"

I had a lot of fun playing it and really enjoyed the morbid humor. Unfortunately, I didn't get to get the rest of the episodes.\n\nI had actually wondered a few months back if Steam would ever pick this up, and I'm happy to see that they have. It's not a serious game, if you're looking towards Alice. The humor is sick and twisted, and the gameplay is fairly simple, but fun. Think of Invader Zim when it comes to the humor.\n\nIf you want something that is easy to pick up and play, but still has a story, you should pick this up. I would suggest getting the complete edition, due to it having all 23 episodes, instead of just picking up the episodes separate.","January 8, 2014","true","2.7"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

You run around trying to make progressively bigger things dirty by touching them, while stopping some very slow cleaners from cleaning up the mess you made. Or in other words: You use the mouse or WASD to move from object to object, now and then you aim and jump for some extra powers, and there's a tiny bit of awkward platforming occasionally for "variety" (during which you get instantly revived from the same spot if you fall). As an idea that sort of gameplay doesn't sound terrible, but it isn't well executed and it ends up being boring and repetitive. It provides no challenge whatsoever, no difficulty progression, no need for any strategy, no need for reflexes or good timing... basically no need for anything more than you staying at your keyboard and/or mouse and running around. I have nothing against casual or arcade-y games, but there has to be *something* captivating about them, and it seems to be missing from here. There are leaderboards trying to entice you to get through a level faster and some hidden coins you can find to improve your score (usually behind big blocky things that confuse the camera and may make you temporarily stuck) but neither feel very tempting, and they are also not rewarded with anything besides bragging rights.\n\nI suppose I can appreciate the art style (even though I didn't really love it) and I suppose there is an attempt here to do something interesting with the storytelling. The concept of turning the original Grimm stories on their head through the gameplay (which has some narrated bits in between and tries to closely follow the changes that you inflict) is not bad.  But I can't really say I personally found the altered stories themselves particulary enjoyable or even funny. There's some dark humor in the cinematics, but the stink and pee jokes aren't my cup of tea and gimmicky trees full of hanging children aren't all that entertaining as far as I'm concerned. Ymmv.\n\nThat aside, there are some technical issues that bothered me. The settings (including your chosen resolution) get reset from episode to episode. There are two annoying small cutscenes every time you reach an inbetween "checkpoint" of sorts, and they get old really fast. Yes, you can hit space to skip all cinematics but you have to do that more or less 5-6 times in every single "level" in every one of the 5-6 stages of every episode. The repetitve quips and looping music get old just as fast, and the sound design generally has some issues.\n\nI tried some of the follow-up episodes to see if anything is done differently, but it doesn't look like it. So play the free episode before buying. If you enjoy that one, then you'll enjoy the rest too.","August 1, 2015","false","3.1"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

I like the style of Spicy Horse but recommending this game would be too bias.\nNaturally, if you plan on buying the episodes try the EP1 first.\n\nSimply put, episode 1, while great ideas and style, is VERY tedious and repetitive.\n\nBasically you run around with main character, leaving trail of grimm stuff around him.\nWhen you run around small area, eventually you will be allowed to "butt stomp"certain things.\nLike tree turned into "evil and grimm tree". Fountain of water turned to lavapit.\nThere are people/animals who will turn your evil areas into "happy" areas again, making you run around the area more than few times. While this is great as idea, it will just turn into tedious as there are no real difficulty other than "oh guess I have to run back there few times over and over"\n\nThe game does not tell you this at first, there is just simple prompt "make it stinky/foul etc" and arrow to object.\nFor first times it might be confusing what to do, but you get hang of it. It does only seem to have 2 things you can do (or 3 if you count the 'natin while standing).\n\n\n\nPros:\n-Story is KINDA original, spicy horse styled.\n-Voice acting seems solid in EP1\n-Cheap(?) and has content if you end up getting all episodes.\n-If you like "gamey" games this will work for you (read cons #3 tho)\n-Graphics, while low-poly, seem really fun and "fairy tale" styled. Fitting perfectly for the game.\n-..which makes the game work on lot of computers\n-FREE\n\nCons:\n-No real difficulty?\n-Essentially story/walking simulator with grindy aspects..\n-Feels VERY mobile-gamey (grindy, low polyed, simple controls (like 2 buttons) running around same area just to make the game feel longer).\nYes I know the game has been released before surge of iPhone games but the mentality still stays.\n-Disappointing that this is where spicy horse went after awesome Alice games :(\n\n\nTL;DR: While seemingly good story, try EP1 before buying.

The audio is the main issue I had with this game. The sound was very dull and quite muffled. I could hardly hear what the main character was saying during the cut scenes, and the game play sound was so low that I had to raise the volume of my speakers up so high that I thought that it was going to blow them out.\n\nThe next issue I had was with the game play. I found the game too easy to do. All I had to do was basically "Butt Stomp" my way through the level every few steps and I was guaranteed that I would complete each level/section. There was not really anything interesting about the levels that stood out to me.\n\nOverall I would rate this game as being an interesting concept, and that is about it.\n\n","June 7, 2015","false","1.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

You hear a "nice" fairy tale and well.....Grimm doesn't like "nice".  This game is hard to describe, but if you have a warped sense of humor like I do and like this easier kind of action game, you will probably like Grimm.  You can play the episodes over, trying to get a better time and find all the "secrets".  Also, you want to try to make everything "dark"...you will see what I mean.  Play the free episode, which is better then a demo to see if you like the game.  Grimm tales were originally not exactly sunshine....not as dark as these stories promise to be, but not happily ever after and a slap on the wrist either.  Try it like is said and see.

He enjoyed it and I enjoyed watching him play it.  In fact I had to butt in and play a few times myself because it looked so fun.  We finished episode 1 and we both wanted to play more so I immediately purchased the full first season.  There is some repitition as far as gameplay is concerned but the entertainment of being able to take a "disneyfied" version of a story and see what you can do to twist it into a darker and more gritty tale outweighs the repetitive nature of the gameplay. I am planning on purchasing the second and third seasons as well (just need to wait til I have the extra scratch).  It's worth it for less than $12.  The only real gripe I have is that you have to set the resolution for each episode individualy instead of all at once.  Each time I launched an episode for the first time it was set to the default 1024x768 which is terrible.","January 24, 2014","true","39.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Plenty of episodes to keep you entertained for hours and each episode is just the right length of gameplay. Now some may say that a downside to this game is its very simplistic gameplay and with this it is a very easy game to play.. BUT unlike many simplistic game mechanics this actually works extramely well here as it means you are free to enjoy and take in all the changes happening including the very funny dialogue that comes along with this from the stories inhabitants. Each episode/story is entertaining in their own way, the writing for the stories is just wonderful with each one being as excellently written as the next. At the time of this review I am still less than 8 episodes in and there are 23 in all to go.\n\nThe episodes only have Grimm as their link and as such can be played in any order you like essentially though I would gues most people would still go through them in the order they are numbered, even if only to save you forgetting which ones you have played through so far.\n\nDespite its cartoony childrens storybook look, some of the content and dialogue is definitely not for very young ears tho in saying that many of the jokes would go way above many childens heads.\n\nOnly real cons for me is that each episode is like a seperately run program/game.. so as such it doesn't remember your chosen resolution should you change it from the default, which i do as i run it in 1080p. This means quickly changing resolutions before each episode.. but this only takes a minute and not a reason to miss out on this game in my eyes.\n\nI highly recommend this game. Its obviously repetative gameplay should not put you off playing it as you would definitely be missing out on many laughs as well as hours of entertainment.","August 13, 2014","true","7.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

A game based around the Grimm fairy tales? I'm game, sign me up please. Haha, if only it were any good... There are 23 episodes which essentially boil down to 23 times the game does the same thing, over and over again. Plot: Take a fairy tale (not necessarily from the Grimm fairy tales too! ). Add tons of gore and violence. Make the language fouler. Make all the colors dark and bland. Poof, there's every single episode in the game. Or well, maybe not. I only played through 18 of them before I just got entirely sick of wasting time on this. Part of that is that when I tried to play episode 19, it crashed! Multiple times! So presumably it just flat-out doesn't work. I didn't even try any of them beyond that, which I shold probably be glad for.\nSo I've talked about how the premise was wasted with a lack of creativity beyond what a 12-year old would come up with. What about the gameplay? Well, each episode is 6 to 9 "levels" where you spend your time "darkening" the environment. This involves basically just... running around. Levels are either painfully easy and inevitably repetitive, or filled with the bad kind of 3D platforming I thought we agreed to get rid of 10-15 years ago.Walking on really thin platforms is a common theme. Some of the environments can get mildly creative but a lot of them feel like repeated scenes more often than not.\nIt just boils down to not being a very interesting game, with occasional bad level design. Maybe one day there will be a good game based around the Grimm fairy tails but this is not that game, what a shame.","April 25, 2014","false","15.1"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

Upon finding out that it's a McGee game, i thought that i ought to wait and see if anything new comes along to show more information about the game. i'd originally thought that, although it does follow McGee's usual pattern for disturbingly dark games, it wouldn't be that good, and i didn't like the art syle of the game, yet upon playing the game, i've noticed how the style suits the game's overall feeling well.\nJudging by the fact that the game is basically about making fables and stories darker and more interesting than their "Happily Ever After" originals, and as these kinds of stories are based towards younger readers, ( - I suppose? - ) the chunky, and crazy style of Grimm reflect well on these ideas.\nThe voice acting seems funny, and the music, although to some annoying, i found catchy, and shall probably have stuck in my head all night, (Thank you Grimm...)\nI recomend at least playing the first episode, and this is officially going on the top of my Wishlist!\nOverall: 7/10\nLoved it, but glitches occasionally,( althought the glitches are generally funn, such as suddenly getting stuck in the branches of a tree somehow, and running around trying to get out, so suddenly find that's at the stomp-zone of that level,) and i'm sure that i'll grow to love the art-style in time.

All of the cautionary tales and dark elements are a delight and make them entertaining. When I saw the trailer for the game, I agreed and was excited to try it. The premise was appealing.\n\nHowever, the delivery is where it falls short. I do not consider it a spoiler to say that when I thought of turning the ridiculously happy town dark and in my opinion, very cool looking, I was not expecting the method to be so vulgar. As the little dwarf imp creature, you go about peeing, farting, and butt stomping things to turn them dark/creepy/ etc. Definitely leaning heavily on the "return to gross." The goal is to end the stage by converting the entire village.\n\nFrom what I saw, and I played only episode 1, you did not get to change elements of the story to make them return to their original dark state. There is story, but it is told to you and is not interactable. Forgive the term, but you are quite literally ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ all over the fairytales, in an effort to win.\n\nNow that the misguided delusions are out of the way, what else can I say about this game? Well, if you were not expecting the same things I was, then perhaps you can enjoy the game. If vulgarity is not off putting to you and you want a little platforming and small puzzle solving all involving a slight Grimm atmosphere, then you might very well enjoy the game.\nIf nothing else, the art style looks really great.","November 2, 2014","false","0.2"," 4 of 11 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","4","11","0","0"

Revert fairy tales into their original darkness and get rid of the bloody "happily ever afters" that seem to infect every single one.\nHowever, as the game goes on, I did not find anything clever about the writing or the humor. To be perfectly honest, it reminded me of the cracks the kids in my class would make when I was twelve. And the fact that the creators programmed Grimm to take a ♥♥♥♥ when you leave him standing still was, frankly, unnecessarily disgusting.\nHowever, if fart jokes are your thing, go on ahead and waste your money on this.","January 12, 2014","false","0.9"," 4 of 11 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","4","11","0","0"

Well, surprisngly, the game does stink and is quite dirty, but that's only b/c that's what the game is about. You play as Grimm, a stinky and evil little man whose goal is to turn everything around him to utter darkness and give off the worst odor imaginable. I'm pretty sure it's based off of the Grimm Fairy Tales, not too sure about this. Only looked up a little bit of information the night before.\n\nIt is an episodic based game. In total there's, IIRC, 23 episodes... Each with about 4-6 levels. The first episode is free on Steam, but you can buy the episodes in bundles of seasons; Season 1, 2, & 3. They are fairly cheap, which just makes them worth it if you have the extra money.\n\nIt's not what you'd expect from a game, but the execution of everthing this game has to offer to me was just awesome and enjoyable.

I enjoy them so much I save them for those times, for I know they will be guaranteed fun/relaxation.I was of a disposition to liking this game in the first place simply because I read many of them from an anthology of Grimm Fairy Tales... thus I put off reviewing the game due to the aforementioned bias.\n\nGo ahead, give it a try, the first one is free... It is definitely worth picking the others up when they go on sale... this from the guy that bought them all via a bundle... simply that satisfied with this gem.","January 12, 2015","true","8.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a goofy, fun little game that you just can't take too seriously; the subject matter is dark if you think too hard on it, so just roll with the silly and don't take it too seriously.\n\nGameplay is easy and uncomplicated.  It actually reminds me a little of Katamari Damacy, not in terms of plot (they couldn't be more different in that regard), but in terms of progression.  As in Katamari, you have to start small and work your way up to being able to handle bigger things, and this has the same progressive dynamic.\n\nAll in all, it's a simple game that doesn't take much thought, and I found it excellent.  It took me about 40 minutes to go through episode one at a very leisurely pace, and it can be completed far more quickly than that.  I would say that the cost for additional episodes is fully reasonable.\n\nJust leave your maturity at the door when you start it up. :)","February 22, 2015","true","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There is hanging, people getting blasted to bits, getting burned on a pyre and more.\n\nThe episodes are standalone stories with each of a playtime of around 30 minutes. The gameplay and controlls are very easy to pick up. You play as Grimm, whose goal it is to make everything around him nasty and turn happy people into rotten ones. You do this by simply walking around. As you do that your stink power will grow and allow you to turn bigger and bigger objects into smelly ones and later even the people. But you have to be careful, the good people are out to clean up your mess.\n\nThe game is well animated and the voice-acting fitting. The only problem I encountered was repeatedly getting temporarily stuck on invisible objects and borders.\n\nThe creators have repeatedly stated that because they no longer have access to the game source they will not add achievements to this game. This also means that there will be no further episodes added or problems fixed (smoothing out objects edges so as to not get stuck), so don't expect anything on that front.\n\nAll in all a really fun and easy game for teenagers and adults looking for a short break.","June 8, 2015","true","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's one of those oddball games that somehow leave an impression on me, but leave me with little to comment. Keep in mind, though, that I've only played the first episode (because it's free, so kudos on you Grimm).\n\nIn Grimm you play as Grimm, a nasty little bugger who stinks up the place and pees every half or quarter second without activity (during cutscenes as well, yes). He hates the goodie good and happy endings of fairytales, and thus has made it his plight to stink up the entire library provided by the game. In the first episode, he teaches a boy to fear because the original story didn't (and I have to admit, I'm on Grimm's side on this particular story, because it originally had no element of fear in it). Grimm does his thing (through you), and badabing badaboom, the story is grotesque and violent and disgusting.\n\nI'll say this, the game has an interesting concept, and I can see why people would be drawn to it. There's a clear goal, there's a clear indication of progression, and the controls are easy to learn and master. Now, I'm not going to act like I know how the rest of the game will be like, considering I've only played the one episode. However, from what I played, I felt I had a pretty good idea of how the rest of the game would be.\n\nSee, around Grimm is a permanent circle of filth, so to stink ♥♥♥♥ up, you run around and perform bum-bashes here and there for greater effect, and that's it (I will admit, it's kind of funny to finally see a game based entirely on the concept of AoE). Sometimes you'll be faced with a platforming section, but the more you have to jump with Grimm, the more you'll realize how awkwardly heavy his jumps are (though considering how heavy he looks, I guess it's... okay?). Additionally, after performing a bum-bash you have a slight moment of "recovery", where you can't input anything and have it registered, and (as I stated earlier) Grimm will start peeing every half or quarter second, meaning you'll be listening to him wetting the ground and seeing yellow dots a lot (if you don't live in constant forward motion, that is). On top of that, the lead-in and lead-out cutscenes last for a long long time (probably like 5 minutes each or something, though when you go in with the mindset that you're about to play a game, it's a little distressing when your hands are on the keyboard, ready to strike into a so far visually pleasing game). It's all nitpicking, I suppose, so take it with a grain of salt for now.\n\nJust looking at the overall look of the game and the concept (and toilet humour), you'd think this would be suitable for children, and I would tell you no. There's blood and gore, Grimm can bum-bash depressed children to death (and watch them explode into a cloud of evaporating blood and chunks of flesh), people are getting hanged and beaten around, so really it's like the GTA of bright and colorful games. But with more death. On the other hand, the contrasts can be really fun to discover, and often inventive, and the voice acting isn't absolutely horrible pigshit, so there's not much to complain about in there (except Grimm's spastic bladder).\n\nSo my final verdict is... It's okay. Yeah, I mean, I wouldn't be spending several nights trying to beat each episode the same way I do an insignificant sidequest in Skyrim from 5pm until 4am, for instance. That being said, I can't really say you should avoid it like the plague. Honestly, Grimm is a kind of game you have to try for yourself, and thankfully the first episode is there to give you a taste. I can't say if you'll like the soups the chef puts in front of you, you'll just have to discover that for yourself. If you don't like it, you don't lose anything. So if you have an interest, go try it out.","October 15, 2015","true","2.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

That it's very fun and simply awesome... Or how about how much it stinks and everything about it is so dirty. Well, surprisngly, the game does stink and is quite dirty, but that's only b/c that's what the game is about. You play as Grimm, a stinky and evil little man whose goal is to turn everything around him to utter darkness and give off the worst odor imaginable. I'm pretty sure it's based off of the Grimm Fairy Tales, not too sure about this. Only looked up a little bit of information the night before.\n\nIt is an episodic based game. In total there's, IIRC, 23 episodes... Each with about 4-6 levels. The first episode is free on Steam, but you can buy the episodes in bundles of seasons; Season 1, 2, & 3. They are fairly cheap, which just makes them worth it if you have the extra money.\n\nIt's not what you'd expect from a game, but the execution of everthing this game has to offer to me was just awesome and enjoyable.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/therealm/recommended/252150/","therealm","R34LM","http://steamcommunity.com/id/therealm/","110 products in account","I found this game to be very enjoyable.\n\nThe basic premise is that you play as a disgutsing littly dude named Grimm who wishes to take away all the neat and tidy and childish out of commonly known fairy tales and replace them with filth, gore and dark undertones.\n\nThe game itself was released in an episodic fashion when it was brand new, coming out every week, but now all three seasons are here.\n\nEach episode and gameplay plays out the same. You begin with Grimm telling you the cutesy version of the fairy tale in the episode (ranging from Father Death, Frog Prince and Snow White as a series finale). When that story is finished, you enter each scene as Grimm and begin spreading filth. Grimm has an aura/radius of darkness that turns the light hearted terrain and objects into darkness. Starting off, you can only convert buckets and flowers, but as you convert more you gain more points towards your darkness level (shown at the top of the screen). Higher levels of darkness means a wider aura, faster speed, higher jumping, and, most importantly, the ability to convert larger objects. During the conversion, fairy tale characters and creatures will attempt to clean up the mess, but they don't prove to be much of an issue.\nThe usual goal in each scene is getting to a certain level of darkness and then "butt-stomping' (jump twice) the plot point to proceed. Once all scenes have been converted, the story is then retold in its raw and dark way and the episode is over.\n\nThe art style fits the theme of the game, with really childish creatures that turn into ugly monstrosities. It's just enjoyable to see what one fairy tale object will convert to, such as a regular tree turning into a tree filled with hanging corpses.\n\nThe humor within this game ranges from fart jokes to satire to black humor, all of which makes the game much mor enjoyable. Grimm himself is an enjoyable narrator and character. Fun fact: the voice actor for Grimm voices EVERY character in the game, which shows off the guy's incredible voice talent.\n\nThe one downside is that once you play one episode you basically have played them all. The gameplay is the same through each episode, though some introduce other gameplay elements.\n\nTo defend that point, however, the game is built around the narration of the story and the curiosity of how each story (and every object in it) will look after Grimm has converted it. So, even though the gameplay is the same, it is a different story to muck up. The choices in fairy tales are great, too.\n\nIf you don't mind the repetitive gameplay, definitely give this game a go. Sometimes it is good to pass 30 minutes of time by playing an episode, and you got three series of episodes to play, which will keep you occupied.","January 17","true","22.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
