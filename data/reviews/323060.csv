The fact that there is a HARD mode beyond the standard NORMAL mode is comparable to saying that the sixth circle of hell isn't so bad because technically there's something worse.\n\nThe fatal flaw in Tharsis is the total lack of balance between potential player success to the imminent damage they are tasked with combating. The ship gains random damage, but the randomness of the damage doesn't seem to have any control limits, so it will quickly overwhelm your ability to fix it.\n\nGameplay:\nThere are 4 player pawns, each with their own unique ability to fix the ship by rolling dice. The number of dice per pawn will be reduced every round through one method or another. In the dozen or so rounds I survived over five games, all my pawns maintained all their dice perhaps twice. PERHAPS twice. Every other round, I lost one die here, two dice there, three dice because a pawn died, you get the idea.\n\nNow, these dice CAN be recovered by eating food or with some dice trickery. You get SOME food at the beginning of the game, but you'll eat it immediately after Round 1. After that, you have to spend precious, precious dice rolls creating food or (here's the fun part) eating your fallen crewmembers. Don't worry, they start you off with a corpse in the medbay, so the table's already set. Yay, Space Cannibalism!\n\nBetween each round you are given a Catch-22 choice. Something along the lines of "Option A) Get dice back, but the ship takes damage; OR Option B) Fix the ship, but the crew loses health." Usually, there is one choice that is slightly less bad, but in virtually every circumstance I thought to myself "I want to do nothing. Nothing would be better than either of these choices. Can I please do nothing?" The game would then cackle maniacally and whisper "Noooooooooooo." (Note: this happened in my head, not reality.)\n\nSO FAR SO GOOD!!\n\nHowever, here's where the game breaks. I don't mean "Awww, it's hard, and me liek eazy gaems." I mean IT IS SHATTERED UNTO DESTRUCTION AND LISTING ENDLESSLY THROUGH THE BLACK VOID OF SPACE.\n\nThe fatal flaw (...get it? Because you'll die!):\nYour ship takes new damage every round. Every. Freaking. Round. However, before long the damage your ship receives becomes mathematically unfixable. I mean it. In every game played so far, even if I Qui-gon Jinned 50% of my rolls, it's a slim chance I would have survived. Of course you can't do that, so you're completely at the mercy of fate. Evil, jerky, space fate.\n\nFor those thinking "Suck it up, pansy, it's a tough game!" I'd like to say two things.\n\n1. Don't call people pansies. That's rude.\n\n2. In my last playthrough before writing this, after round 4 my ship had two damaged rooms remaining, with 10 and 11 damage respectively. During the mid-round, I had the choice of A) Killing two of my three remaining characters to give the ship 2 health and keep the last character's two dice OR B) Kill that guy instead to give the ship 4 health, feed his fresh corpse to the other two, and use their combined 9 dice to give it the ol' space college try. I chose the latter option. Then, In Round 5 my ship received 3 newly damaged rooms with a total of 76 damage (30/26/20). SEVENTY-SIX. For those keeping track, that's a grand total of 97 damage spread between five rooms that I have to fix with 9 dice. YOU CAN'T EVEN DO THAT. And yes, for those wondering, I prioritize the repairs in terms of severity.\n\nUltimately, Tharsis can be fixed, and it needs to be. Until it is, it's merely a way to experience the wild and frantic desperation of a gushing knife wound without actually being stabbed.\n\nHow I'd describe it: Yahtzee + FTL + sandpaper to the brain\nOverall score: 3 out of 5\nReason: Concept is beautiful but the math doesn't math, and it really, really, really needs to math.\n\nQuick Update 1/24/16: Raised by one star. Still an evil, evil game, but some folks like that kind of thing.\n\n\nTOP REVIEW EDIT, Jan 30: Thanks for all the comments, folks! Well, most of them, at least. ;)\n\nThe tips and suggestions many have made are excellent strategic advice, and I've implemented some of those already with varying levels of success. (I'd already used some before the review, particularly prioritizing repairs based on current health/dice/damage, but that made it boring as hell.)\n\nThe intent of the review is to inform and state my opinion so others have a point of reference. It's certainly not to tell everyone to make the same choice or have the same thoughts as I do. This is why I'm THRILLED that it encouraged some folks to BUY THE GAME!! May the fates guide your dice. Well... technically they already do, but... you know what I mean.","January 16","false","8.6"," 1,329 of 1,490 people (89%) found this review helpful 656 people found this review funny","89","329","1","656","55"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/spaaaaaaace/recommended/323060/","spaaaaaaace","=]DI[= Dirty Harry","http://steamcommunity.com/id/spaaaaaaace/","301 products in account","The vast majority of this game revolves around the following:\n- 1 or more events ("bad things") occur each turn.\n- All of these events involve a module of your ship becoming damaged in some way, with a consequence for leaving the module unrepaired and a certain amount of repair points required to repair it.\n- Each of your crew memebrs gets a number of dice.\n- You move one or more crew members to the damaged module.\n- The crew members roll their dice.\n- If the result is higher than the number of repair points then you successfully repaired the module. If not, you suffer the    consqeuences of leaving it unrepaired.\n\nIf you have a crew member with some dice left over, you can engage in some of the other "gameplay" on offer, such as:\n- Moving your character to the food module, then rolling their dice and trying to get 3 of the same number in order to get food.\n- Moving your character to the communication module, rolling their dice and trying to roll  >5 in order to reduce that characters "stress level".\n- Moving your character to the medbay, rolling their dice, trying to roll >5 to heal your character.\n\nDo you see where this is going? The entire game is the one single mechanic. Move a person to a module. Roll their dice. Either go "Yay. I did it." or "Dang. I failed." entirely at the mercy of RNG.\n\nAs a result of this, it feels to me more like I am watching the game play itself, with me just along to look at it (not helped by the fact that the game is not very pretty.)\n\nI did not find this game very entertaining. I don't like being so heavily at the mercy of RNG. Maybe this could be  forgiven a little if there was more variety in terms of the events that happen and the actual gameplay involved, but there is so little content.

Not only does God play dice, the dice are loaded."\nChairman Sheng-ji Yang\n"Looking God in the Eye"\n\nTharsis is a Faster Than Light (FTL)-like board/card/dice game mix in which you guide a group of 4 survivors of a meteoroid disaster on their spaceship trip to Mars. Whether you will manage or not will be determined by your knowledge of the game, your skill and your luck.\n\nIf you have been wondering why the hell did I put that quote from Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri in the beginning of the review, it is because it's just that - the dice are indeed loaded. The throws you make in this game are purely cosmetic and only give an impression of you actually influencing the game somehow. If the RNG decided that you will get a score of 15 with 4 dices, that is exactly what is going to happen, and you will constantly see dices taking weird bumps or even flat-out turning over to show a different number.\n\nSo what kind of game this is then? I would dare to say it is more of a board game than anything else. You draw a set of cards at the beginning of each turn that represent disaster events of various magnitudes and you need to deal with them smartly and carefully. This also means, that even if you do all the correct choices, you can still lose a mission through no fault of your own, because the dice rolls and the almighty RNGesus may totally screw you over.\n\nSo, as usual, let's take a look at the good and the bad.\n\nTHE GOOD:\n1. Beautiful, comic-style artwork.\n2. A very pleasant ship to look at and even fool around with it for a bit by opening hatches, using consoles, and so on.\n3. Great music that totally fits the space theme. I love it, and I will be playing and enjoying it long after I am done with the game.\n4. Voice acting that even if not really required by this type of game, is still a very welcome addition.\n5. You always get that adrenaline rush when you roll the dice, even if you know that eventually the outcome is picked by an RNG-machine.\n6. Thinking before making a move is crucial in this game. Smart decisions actually tip the scales in your favor, and can totally improve the situation you are in.\n7. The game is winnable regardless if you're employing special tactics or not, which is nice for the people who just want to roll some dice and still have a favorable outcome.\n8. A good amount of unlockable crew members to further the replayability of the game. There is no bad crewman in this game, albeit some special skills are more useful than others.\n9. A single run takes between 15-30 minutes, which is great for a low-priced (9,89€ 34% off now) casual game, that you can totally sink some time into as a welcome break between all those AAA titles.\n10. Good replayability.\n11. Very engaging gameplay for a board/card/dice game mixture.\n12. Great pricing at launch - you have time till 18.01 to grab it at 34% off, which is a way bigger chunk off the main purchase price than many other developers tend to allow for at launch.\n13. You can reroll, hold on to, and use dices based on your crewmember special skill and the board setup. This can save you... or not. I still find it as a positive in this game though.\n14. I would also like to add a 14th good thing now - I don't know if you noticed, but on the main menu there is a greyed out button names "missions" - so I guess there will be even more content coming our way, which is always a great thing to look forward to.\n15. A few days after launch, I am happy to add a 15th good thing about the game - the developers really worked a lot to push a number of updates to address a plethora of issues various gamers had (like game not starting, black screens after logo, DX9 compatibility, etc.). I absolutely love it when the developers show that they actually care about their game and are willing to work for hours and hours on end to meet the demands of their paying customers. Well done, people. My hat is off to you. You could have easily taken a week off after launch, drank beer (or whatever their alcoholic beverage of choice is) and just checked your accounts to see the money rolling in, but you didn't. That's the way to do it.\nAN IMPORTANT ONE:\n16. People, after so many hours in the game, I can tell you one thing. The game is very easy to win once you unlock some additional crewmembers and let it teach you how to do it.\n\nAnd now, the BAD:\n\n1. It is a luck game, which means that you can lose it through no fault of your own. If you like games that you have better control of, this one is not for you.\n2. This game can be frustrating as hell, turning a good run into a terrible one in just a single week. If you have a short fuse and get easily irritated, or have anger issues, this game is not for you. All I can say is that the sooner you accept this game for what it is - a casual dice-rolling FTL, the better for you, your health and the longevity of your PC/Laptop.\n3. The dice are loaded - the whole dice rolling thing is to give you the illusion of you doing something or having some control. Now if you could like, kick the table, or bump it or something, in order to change the outcome of the roll, that's at least some control, but we don't have it here.\n4. The story is very predictable - I knew what will happen in the ending halfway through the game when I saw the transmission from Mars - I am not going to spoil it for you, though.\n5. The fact that you have very little control over the hand that is dealt to you - meaning research projects, disaster events, inbetween week choices, etc. - means that you will most of the time have to make terrible decisions which you don't even know whether they would be positive or not until you see the next turn. That is profoundly frustrating and may put a number of people off the game. You make a perfect choice for the situation just to see it ruined 5 seconds later. Not fun.\n6. As a consequence from 1-5, the game is hard as hell. It may take you a crazy amount of retries to even get past week 5, let alone winning the game due to its serious learning curve and heavy RNG focus.\n- To clarify: What I meant by a learning curve is for example you really need to learn which crew member to play from first to last in a mission depending on all factors. Sometimes it's good to go first with the captain, sometimes it's not. Also knowing when to use a research project or not, when to fix or not, when to sacrifice or not is also part of the learning curve. This game is way, way, waaaay deeper than it looks. It's not all dice rolls and completing events. Some low-risk events are sometimes better off left alone so that nothig worse spawns in that module, for example.\n7. And this is purely subjective - I have a feeling that, more often than not, you are being dealt at least 3 or more unfavorable hands during your journey. Having 3 events worth 5 total ship damage of difficulty 20 or more on week 2, and one of those with a 1, 3 and 5 injury dice is a total ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t unless you aced the first week with flying colors. In my opinion, the game does a rather poor job at scaling the events, but then again, you can totally luck out and have a breeze with your run, so I guess it evens out.\n\nSo, the conclusion:\n\nI am very pleased to wholeheartedly recommend this game to the gamers out there who like a good mix of a casual board/card/dice game. I would also love to give props to the developers for allowing us to purchase it at bargain price at launch, and not wait for the next steam sale.This game is the perfect on-and-off experience inbetween gaming sessions, or to just pass the time by "gambling" your way through it. However, if you dislike one or more of the "bad" sides of the game, I would totally stay away from it, as you will most likely get frustrated or disappointed by it easily.\n\nP.S. This game is way more than dice, people. Let it teach you and stop hating on it solely because of the dice rolls :)","January 12","true","22.2"," 186 of 240 people (78%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","78","186","240","17","37"

Some more games in, you start to grasp the underlying concepts and math behind the game and start getting closer and closer. Then you have one lucky run and breeze through the game with little to no diffculties.\n\nAnd now I'm at that point and are mostly bored. It doesn't feel like me winning was too much of actual skill involved, but mostly just getting lucky picks with the dicerolls, the events, their order and the side projects. And I have no doubt that I will simply lose the next couple games again, even if I play just the same.\n\nAnd that isn't even considering the fact that I would just play the exact same game again. Maybe switch out one of the crewmen, but that's all you're apparently able to do. The 'Missions - Coming soon' button hints there might be more added later, but as of now, the game only offers you simple 20min sessions (usually shorter, because death).\n\n\nIn total, a good concept, lovely crude RNG, but a complete lack of replayability and/or deeper learning.\nAnd that for 10€?

But there's a way... Most of the time. It might sometimes be a long shot, but hey, it's a flight to Mars.\n\nSo, For example, you have this fire in the greenhouse, 29 damage to fix. Also, you get injuries when rolling a 4, a 5 and a 6.\nAnd it does 2 dmg to your ship hull every turn. And your ship has only 2 hull HP's right now.\nWell, it looks grim to say the least.\nAnd of course, this isn't the only event going on. So, what to do ? Well, you could rush all your crew to the greenhouse and most surely kill them all trying to get those 29 points with rolls.\nBut no, you have to think laterally.\n\nSo, there's this other event in the maintenance. This one looks better : only 10 dmg to fix, and maybe void effect when rolling a 2. (void makes your dice disappear, rending them unusable for anything)\nNow we can see the starting point for a solution to our problem in the greenhouse.\n\nLet's send our mechanic there and roll some dice. With a bit of luck, he will avoid rolling too much 2s. Ok : a 1, a 5, and two 4. Those two four are interresting : in this room, we can use dice of equal value to increase the ship's hull HP. The first two equal dices giving 2 armor, a third one adding one more armor point.\nOk, so now the fire in the greenhouse won't destroy the ship. Not on this turn at least.\nOur mechanic isnt done yet. Let's use our 5 to reduce the damage in the maintenance room, and the 1 on research.\n\nNow it's turn for the Captain to work. Let's make him join the Mechanic in maintenance. He ate some food at the end of last turn, so he can throw five dices. Ok : a 2, a 3, two 5, a 6.\nA 2 : void. But we had one assist point, so it doesn't take effect. No more assist points though, so we gonna need to build up some more later if we want to throw dice in the greenhouse without risking too much injuries.\nWith a 4 we could've finish what the mechanic started with his dices and and add a third dice to the hull HP, but no luck.\nBut with the 5 we can finish to repair whatever was broken in here, so that's that.\nNow the only place to use the remaining dices is the research bar, let's do it : with the 1 from the mechanic and the 2, 3 and 6 from the captain, it's almost full, and we already have 4 points to spend on research bonus. Wich is good, because with two more points, we could unlock a sweet 28 damage repair bonus for one room.\n\nNow the solution is clear : Build some more assist points to avoid injuries in the greenhouse, completing the research bar to get the bonus. The place to do that is the Laboratory. Let's send our Specialist there.\n\nShe only has two dice to roll, meh, but there's no event going on in the Lab, so we can rolll the dices safely.\nNow it's all down to luck.\nShe might get a 4 and a 5, allowing us to complete the research bar right now on this turn. We could then send our fourth crewmate in greenhouse, use the bonus, and try getting 1 more point with dice rolls to finish the repairs; but with injuries on 4, 5 and 6, it could be very dangerous for him.\nOr she might get a 1 and a 6. The 6 can be used to get 3 more assist points, but the 1 would be useless.\nOr she might get two 5. With that we could still get the assist points we need, and the other 5 would be directed to research, to be completed next turn.\n\nSo that's it. Of course, you might be overwhelmed by terrible events all over the ship on this next turn. Or it could go well with only minor events, giving the time you need to fix the greenhouse and maybe even grow some food for the turn after that ...\n\nLuck is important in this game. Be Lucky, be clever, and you might just make it ... for better or worse.\n\nPS: im french, and trying to improve my english. I hope my text was ok for you to read. And thanks for doing it :)\n\n","January 18","true","5.2"," 84 of 98 people (86%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","86","84","98","4","3"

At this moment I ve had a few plays.. ending in the death of all my crew.. the ship destroyed and scattered to the emptiness of space...\nBUT!!!\nIts a fun game.\nMany reviews so far say.. Brutally Hard.. Bad Game.. Devs dont care.. blah blah..\nHARDLY...  This game is truly the closest I ve seen a blast to the past in the form of random.. fate controlled by not only your actions.. but the roll of the die...  It even includes ways you can get a 're roll' and an ' assist ' ( Think old school ADandD saving throw to keep it simple.. or a boon from your sadistic DM )\nI can think of a few games from back in the ' day ' that were much harder, geared to destroy the player and dice were the instruments of the evil games work.. but they were fun. I wont list a bunch of things that most of you have probably never heard of.. nor can even find these days...\nSO THE BREAKDOWN:\nThe game is not out to kill you. Fate is fate. You can have a great thing going.. and lose it all.. or you can survive.. chance.\nUnlike so many games these days, there is no ' strategy '. You have to look at the problems, look at what you have available in the form of your crew, and make your best decisions. Totally winnable. It just wont be easy, and it cant be done with a 'pattern' of behavior.\nBut if your doing things right, you can change fate.. via the 'save' in the form of 'assist'.\nNormally I say here.. why play? This time I ll say why not.. THEN why..\nWHY TO NOT PLAY:\nIf you simply must be able to win a game all the time.\nIf you cannot tolerate old school fate vs figuring out how a strategy works.. ( real life doesnt offer set place strategy either btw )\nIf you have to be able to reload a save when you dont like something.\nIf you never liked old school pen and paper, dice rolls and a sadistic chance chart.. definently stay away.\nWHY TO PLAY:\nIf when you do win, it makes you actually feel like you pulled one over.\nIf you remember old school.\nIf you like the feeling you used to get when life hung in the dice..\nIf you like making tough decisions that may kill a crew mate but allow others to live.\nIf you dont mind a bit of frustration, and sheer angst ( again, my feeling was like losing ol' Peter the Paladin many many moons ago )\noh... and yeah.. cannabalism is an option if it gets really bad... One falls so that others may live and all that...\n\nBTW.. the first time you play... I d say you have a 99.9% chance of total death of crew.. but dont even worry about it.. that first one should be nothing more than "What the heck am I doing???

And to be fair, it's not because it's hard because there is nothing really hard about the concept of the game.  You control a group of astronauts aboard a spacecraft heading toward mars, when suddenly everything goes wrong it's up to you and your crew to band together and survive until you reach mars.\n\nThe game revolves around taking your crew around to certain parts of the ship where there are issues and try to fix them.  To fix them you must get a certain number of points by rolling dice in order to fix the calamity.

Do you use all your dice to go toward the problem, or do you use a couple in going into reaserch to help you later?  This is where the game takes a sour note unfortunately, it gets bogged down with too many things going on and essentially it sets you up for failure in the first couple of turns.  The game is randomly generated, meaning the events that occur and the stats that the crew starts with are different each time, but it doesn't seem to matter since the minute the game starts you are put into an almost game over state during the first turn.  Here is an example of one of the very short games I played and how it went.\n\nTURN ONE\n\n-Two problems: One in operations costing 15 points to fix and causes -1 health to all crew. The other in Maintenance costing 12 points to fix, causes one damage to the ship at the end of the turn. Also rolling a two or four in maintenance causes the crewman to suffer injuries.\n\n-Send a my engineer down to fix Maintenance. He has only two dice. First roll is two fours, my guy takes double damage an dies because he only started with two health.  (I chalked this up to bad luck and didn't get discouraged)\n\n- After using all of my crew I manage to fix the problem in Maintenance, the issue in operations didn't get fixed this turn. The turn ends, one health is taken away from my crew killing my doctor in the process because she started with only one health. (kind of annoyed, but once again chalked it to bad luck).\n\nTURN TWO\n\n-There are THREE problems this time: one in the Greenhouse which costs 25 points to fix and causes two damage to the ship at the end of the turn.  Another in Medical, this one cost THIRTY (completely unrealistic number considering how many dice your given between crewmates which is somewhwere between 2 and 3 at the start of the game) points to fix and would do THREE damage to the ship at the end of the turn. The last one in operations which costs Twenty points to fix and does two damage to the ship at the end of the turn.\n\n-naturally my crew of two managed to only scrounge up something like twelve points and then the turn ended and the ship was destroyed.\n\n\nNow copy and paste that experience about six more times and that was my experience with the game.  It's not challenging, it's just unfair. The odds it stacks againgst you at times are so overwhelming that you can never hope to overcome it.  And because of that it just makes the experience of the game infuriating and lacking of any fun to play.  The concept is really interesting, which is why I decided to pick it up, but the execution of it leaves a lot to be desired in terms of gameplay. Unless you are really into getting frustrated and losing repeatedly in about 5 minutes, I would steer away from this game.","January 16","false","0.7"," 125 of 182 people (69%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","69","125","182","8","9"

I underestimated the level of imbalance people discribed. When people say this game is imbalanced. What they mean to say is odds are only slightly better of winning then the Powerball.\n\nFirst off. The Status of your crew entirely random when you begin a game. Sometimes they're all at max health. I lost the game durring the first week. Or 1 turn. Looking at it I didn't have a chance to begin with. First turn 4 different modules broken, with 20 something each to fix them all with a 2 damage tick fo the ship. Meaning I had to roll roll a 100 with just 4 dice.\n\nWhy just four dice? Every single crewmate started with only one die each. Some also started with 1 HP.\n\nThis is not a game of tactics like it described itself as. The devolper said that "Only 30% of the players have ever beaten the game." When he says that he doesn't mean 70% chance of losing a game. No he means out of all the people ho play likely mutiple times only 30% of them ever seen a victory ending.\n\nIt sucks too. If the RNG and balance was a little better this would be a decent indie game.\n\nAlso do not get fooled by the difficulty setting. Normal and Hard modes are both impossible. Click Hard if you wanna be absolutely certain to lose.","January 16","false","11.0"," 80 of 111 people (72%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","72","80","111","5","0"

You can get into rather unfair positions, and luck is a factor, but like most games involving luck managing your risk is really the crucial mechanism of the game. Sometimes you do everything right and the dice burn you, and occasionally you get a milk run where everything goes smoothly, but most of the games are, I think, well-placed on a tight line where survival depends on how well you weigh the odds.\n\nAdditionally, one thing I really enjoy about this game is that you can stagger to the finish even after a major disaster, especially a late problem, and salvage partial mission success out of a busted run. A lot of games like this, if you take an early hit (like losing a crewmember) you might as well start over, but in Tharsis some mechanisms like cannibalism let you limp to the end of your run. That is a lot of fun.\n\nOn the negative side, the interface is a little primitive and slow-witted, and the gameplay variety is lacking at the moment. Hopefully the promised extra missions will improve this last point.","January 15","true","17.2"," 52 of 67 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","52","67","0","0"

It has been very stable for me, and I note the developer is active on the forums.\n\nA playthrough is typically short (my win percentage at present is below 10%) and it's easy to get back into on resume. If I see a playthrough is likely lost in the first few turns I just start a new game. A full game can take from 30 -90 minutes, depending on how much pondering you are doing. As a result Tharsis is at present my go to game if I only have 15-30 minutes to play something.\n\nThe cannabalism aspect is rather dark but adds a unique element. Yet another reason not to sign up for Mars One, if you had any thoughts of doing so!\n\nIt's also rather unique which is nice to see in an era of so many clones and sequels.\n\nI see a lot of complaints about the randomness of the game. I find that in many strategy games one can find a handful (or even 1) techniques/strats to beat the game, and once I've discovered those, thereafter I tend to stick to those strats, as do my gamer friends (for example forest farming in Civ 3). This game destroys that and as a result adds a large element of challenge and suspense as there are usually surprises every turn.\n\nIf you have a short fuse or expect to win every game you own on every playthrough, you will not like this game.\n\nIf you are into strategy games that like to throw you curve balls, keep you on your toes, and don't have a problem abandoning a lost cause by restarting, you will like this game.","January 14","true","34.5"," 62 of 85 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","62","85","0","8"

Because it is on fire."\n\nIf you like reviews with fact-based statistical content, READ THIS REVIEW (well the bit at the top).\n\nUPDATE: I'm moving this to the top of my review because I feel it's important. There is something in common with a lot of the most popular negative reviews about this game, and that is the theme that this is not a strategy game because you are completely at the mercy of the RNG and bad game design.\n\nWell, my Tharsis record is now at 30 wins, 0 losses, and only 3 crew deaths, at least 2 of which were preventable because I done goofed. Let that sink in. I have a 30 game winstreak. The odds of that happening if you can only win half of the time are 0.5^30. That is, 1 in 1,073,741,824 (1 in a billion. "So you're saying there's a chance?"). All of this done on livestream and nobody watching the livestream to see how I play has disputed my win streak.\n\nYou read that correctly, that is 1 in a billion chance (or 1x10^9), at the minimum levels of game balance e.g. 50/50. Now if the other reviews were correct, and your chances were actually much lower than 50/50, then the chances of my getting a 30 win streak are quite literally, astronomical (pun intended), about the same chance I've got, of building a bottle rocket, and getting it to land on Tharsis, in real life.\n\nOn top of that, I've been playing on Hard. My win streak of 30 games includes 5 games on Hard difficulty- so even Hard difficulty is balanced to be winnable. Back when my win streak was at 20, a very great statistician on the forums called codexus calculated with 99% confidence that my chances of winning a game were greater than 80%, including my misplays, and worked out that the chances 97%+ of winning any game would be a 50/50 bet- this based on a win streak of 20.\n\nI'll quote his summary here, based on 20 wins in a row:\n99.9999046% sure it's winnable more than 50% of the time (yup that's the actual number)\n99% sure it's winnable more than 79.4% of the time\n90% sure it's winnable more than 89.1% of the time\n80% sure it's winnable more than 92.2% of the time\n50% sure it's winnable more than 96.6% of the time.\n\nYou have to face facts, this game is either perfectly balanced to be winnable, or I should be the richest lottery winner on Earth, from all of the lottery tickets I should be buying.\n\nI'm just going to leave my review here, I think that's all I really need to say now. You can read the original review below, if you want to torture yourself, because it's pretty long and lame compared to what I just said:\n\n\n\nYay it's time for one of my poorly written, lazy reviews that I don't spend any time on. *wall of text follows* actually it's mostly just stuff I copy and pasted that I already wrote in the forum, edited up a bit to look even messier.\n\nDifficulty: 10/10\nThreads on this game "Yadda yadda this game is too easy/hard/imba" - No it's fine. Cannabalism could be a little less stressful, I mean, that's good eating.\nThat aside, my third win I had a ship damaging event that I wasn't able to spare anyone to fix for half of the run, and we still got to Mars in great shape.\nThe balance seems okay to me so far, I've had some tight spots and close calls but nothing I haven't been able to beat so far.\n\nDamage control (affecting the dice rolls):\nThe order in which you tackle events and the ways you use the rolls you get affect the final outcomes a lot.\nThere is a resource called Assists which gives you a lot of control when used well.\nThe research projects give you a lot of control over the results too. Say you roll more poorly then you expected, but you saved up some good research "just in case", you throw those low numbers in and purchase that research project.\n\nInterface: 10/10\nThe game has a nice interface too, I haven't had any complaints, and never felt like "Oh you know what would good, if this did THIS, or we had a THING over there, doing THAT".  It's great.\nTheres a few nice touches you don't necessarily notice at first and all of the information you need is generally presented visually otherwise right there when you need it, without having to click on anything else.\nAnother example, I liked that when you click on ship info you can see which modules already have dice slotted in, and in the same vein, when you move somebody to a location, you have the option to go back, if you change your mind or saw something you didn't expect.\n\nSound: 6/10\nThe music track is okay, I'd say around average, which doesn't mean bad, because you expect decent tracks from games.\nThe sound is okay too, I laugh whenever my guys do a side project that hurts them and then *LOUD CLUNK* they shake their heads.\nThe voice actor for the cutscenes is really good.\n\nReplayability: 6?+(more when Missions come out)/10\nThere's a few character unlocks you can use to mix up your team setup.\nYou get 1 after 1 win, another 3 after performing some common actions, which will take around 4-8 or less wins to unlock, and one more.\nRough estimate in wins: 1 win to get Pilot, 3 wins to get Technician, 6 wins to get Psychologist, 8 wins to get Commander, 40 wins to get Cannibal (10 if you eat everyone else on the ship, maybe)\nMissions/Challenges are planned but not released yet, so I can't comment on those.\n\nOverall: 8/10 because math is mean.\n\n\nBuy recommendation:\nIf you're into this sort of game(watch some videos first!), and are prepared to weather out the difficulty curve,\nthen Yes, try to get a discount price (it's on 34% release discount).\n\n\nEntering deep TL;DR territory:\nEven some of the people leaving negative reviews have admittedly enjoyed the game itself, just not the rigid difficulty or something else.\nI'd say the game is fun whether you win or lose. There's always hard mode and different crew setups if you want to add/reduce challenge. Devs may add an easy mode, which would probably be like normal but negate the harshness of bad luck or allow a few mistakes here and there.\nThat might influence reviews, along with the Mission mode which will add to replayability.\n\nSome people say that the game is 95% RNG because they didn't win in XX games, but I've won all 3 rounds (base crew, no special crew, no deaths) that I played so far.\nIf that's RNG then that must be good RNG helping me win.\n\n\n\nSTOP READING! ITS OVER. GO HOME.\n\n\n\nAn example of how one event in the game goes:\n\nI have an event on my current turn that would wreck me if I didn't plan ahead. This event deals 3 health damage for every 1 that you roll on a D6. You roll up to 5 dice and crew have maximum 6 health, so as you can see, it's on the deadly side.\n\nHowever, on the previous turn, I moved a crew member to the Lab to gain 3(max) Assists. Each assist will negate 1 negative roll, which means each assist will negate 3 health loss, which is hugely beneficial. It's always a good idea to have a lot of Assists, and although it was lucky I had them right when this event occured, there was nothing to stop me diverting to the Lab first before going to the hazardous area if I didn't have them. This is the deadliest event I encountered so far- so I think it's fine,\n\nI just had to think of a way to deal with it, and there's at least two ways: The Lab, which is always available, and Research, which isn't, but could include for example a project that instantly repairs a module, or a project that blocks all injury damage for an entire turn. For that matter, I have a research project that can instantly repair the deadly module, and enough research, so I do have two options to deal with it already.\n\n\n10 of 10 (100%) Jive monkeys found this review.. ooh look, bananas (too long)\nSEAMOOSE INFLATABLE CABBAGE","January 13","true","135.4"," 83 of 127 people (65%) found this review helpful 27 people found this review funny","65","83","127","27","4"

But that said, it's not that hard (on normal difficulty) and since the games are short, you can just try again and have better luck on your next attempt.\n\nI enjoyed the mood of the game, and the production value is surprisingly good for a game like that. Overall this game is a very nice surprise!\n\nEDIT:\nAfter playing some more, I'd say on normal difficulty pretty much every game is winnable and with correct strategy you should get 90% or better win rate. Hard mode is a bit harder but you can still get a good win rate. This game is beautifully balanced and forces you to think.

You will lose a lot and most of that time will not be your fault at all, just unforgiving Dice Gods who love to see you squirm. With that said, I like this game. Basically, you're the captain of a ship called the Iktomi which is on a mission to Mars. Disaster strikes and cripples your ships food stores leaving your group in a very dire situation in which it must find ways to generate new food while surviving the unforgiving hell that is space.  You will have to resort to cannibalism at points. You will manage the groups food and health while also trying to repair damage caused by unending meteoroid strikes. However, you do have ways to control what is otherwise just a random number generator simulator... For example, assists which can stop crewmen from being injured or using your dice to repair the ship, heal the crew based on someone's class. You have to survive 10 whole weeks, which doesn't sound that long but so far the furthest I've gotten is about 5 weeks in and even then, only 2 people of my original 4 made it that far. Personally, I can't wait to see what other missions they add in.\nPros:\n-Addicting gameplay\n-It's like an interactive board game\n-Who doesn't like ripping fingernails off in anger?\n-Well-drawn and voice acted cutscenes in between turns that add a little cinematic quality to the nightmare\n-It's a really good looking game. I love how when you zoom up to a module you can really just sit there and inspect it.         Take all those details in!\n-Cannibalism!\n-Lots of managing resources is going on despite the restrictions by a RNG.\n-Plenty of events that make you wonder if space really is a place Mankind should go, you know, because of all the brutal  unending death that seems prevalent throughout.\n\nCons:\n-I don't like ripping fingernails off in anger.\n-This game is really hard and sometimes it feels unfair. I'd just prefer to roll the dice myself.\n-Can they make an easy mode?\n-The tutorial leaves much to the player to figure it out themselves.\n-RNG is lame but an almost necessary evil.\n-It's not an actual boardgame that can be bought.\n\nIn summary, this game is good and pretty cheap for some quality entertainment.

Most of the negative reviews would have you believe that everything boils down to luck, that even if you play perfectly you will still get screwed by RNG - and this is simply incorrect. This game is about managing dice rolls. The rolls themselves may be random, but the gameplay is brilliant in that it offers a ton of ways to play around randomness. You need to strategize and figure out how to make your chances better. The game's rules and mechanics are deceptively simple - you can pick it up and instantly think that you've learned all that there is - but being able to see all your options requires experience. During my playtime, I gradually learned how to play more efficiently and cleverly, how to cleverly manage some of the frequently-overlooked mechanics (like using/generating assists or refreshing research options at the right time), when to take risks and when to play safe... Now with 20+ hours under my belt, I can consistently beat the game. In short: The game is not that hard. It's easy to learn, and hard to master; but mastering it is very rewarding.\n\nIf you are not up to the challenge of mastering it, don't buy this game. If you like strategic thinking and risk management, give it a shot. Just know that you will lose many games in your first few hours - but if you learn from your mistakes (and don't blame RNG when you take an unwise risk and it doesn't pay out) you will get better and start winning consistently.","January 18","true","36.3"," 31 of 40 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","31","40","0","0"

One game will end two turns in because of the ounslaught of unwinnable events and another will go easy on more for about five or six before doing the same thing -- all independent of how strategic I played.  That's a problem, and no I'm not expecting to have a victory handed to me.  What I am missing is a sense that I am progressing.

I enjoy dice games, which inherently have a chance element to them, such as Roll Through the Ages or Kingsburg.  I watched the YouTube previews of Tharsis before release, and I was very excited to try it out.  When I saw the initial negative reviews claiming Tharsis was too luck-based, I thought to myself, “Ha!  They just don’t know how to play and aren’t skillful enough!”\n\nI was wrong.\n\nTharsis is the very first game I can think of that feels too luck-based to me.  It feels completely random and you may as well just flip a coin to see if you win or lose.  I did hear YouTubers who were playing the preview mention how either they would win with a full crew or die completely – it’s because Tharsis swings in extreme directions, given how much random chance is at play and how little you can mitigate the problems.\n\nSo ultimately, a thumbs down from me.  I was expecting to like Tharsis, but it turns out I was wrong.\n","January 13","false","1.7"," 51 of 79 people (65%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","65","51","79","2","1"

If you are like me and enjoy (if that word is even applicable) the RNG in games like blood bowl, then you will absolutely adore this game because the only way to reliably win in Tharsis isn't to rely on luck but to make your own luck by minimising risk. Due to the obvious nature of dice games, there is no certain way to avoid defeat as you could simply get a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ roll.\n\nIncorporating story into a game with such a random nature can be quite difficult and sometimes completely useless but thankfully, choice provisions implemented story in a brilliant. Instead of viewing each story part in order from start to finish, you are viewing the first few cut scenes over and over until you finally survive one week longer than ever before and unlock a new part of the story which feels very much like unlocking a new ending to The Binding of Isaac. The feeling of mystery you get each time you unlock that next cut scene is almost worth the price of admission alone. On top of that, the themes in this game are great! Modern Sci-Fi with dark decision making and survival themes like cannibalism and character stress. It's a bit of a mix between The Martian and Darkest Dungeon with a healthy amount of gnawing on your crew mates arm thrown in for good measure. Because of the way that is conveyed, Tharsis isn't so much a story of success that you happen to fail repeatedly at, but a story of failure that one day, through your progression as a player, might actually complete.\n\nIf you are a fan of strategy games or even science fiction as a genre, then this is a must buy.

I really do. Its cruel, random, completely unforgiving and sometimes it makes me want to scream my lungs out in frustration. But I really like it. Why? Well first off I like the setting, it sends you to the most dangerous and inhospitable place known to man. You're not supposed to be there and the game makes damn sure you know that. There is no help coming, no way to stay alive, all you can do is try and soldier on. Its all hopeless.\n\nSecondly, I like the progression of the game. Even a totally failed game where two crewmen were eaten, one got blasted in to space and the last one used the last oxygen screaming in terror as the ship fell apart around her, makes you inch ever closer to unlocking new crew. And belive me, some of those crew really makes a huge difference.\n\nThirdly, there IS strategy amongst all the random death by sewage in the water tank. Learning how to use your dice takes time and you have to stick with it, but ones you understand the system almost no roll is useless. You can always put a die there, regain some dice here, get some assists or work towards that expensive research project that next turn could allow you to fix a module for free and then that guy could go harvest food and that guy could get his health back and.. So and and so on.\n\nSo yes, the game is cruel, random and you will fail. And fail. And fail again. I have 37 games played. Out of those 37 games I've won 7. Out of those 7 I have managed to get the entire crew to their destination 2 times.

The game will seem ridiculously hard and you'll write a pissy review, wondering why there's a hard mode when normal mode is already impossible.\n\nExcept it's not. I've won two of my last three games after 6 hours of play, and I'll be ready for hard mode soon.\n\nThis game requires you to consider ALL your options each turn—not just the flashing red rooms, but those nifty machines in the undamaged rooms that reliably give you die, or health, or assists or sanity and generally keep your crew healthy enough to consistently deal with the damage.\n\nJust keeping stress down has a huge effect, as you'll start to get GOOD side ops that make the next turn easier instead of harder. And don't be afraid to just let some rooms burn, especially in the late game when there's less ROI on fixing them. The mechanic alone can pretty easily add 2 or 3 hull points per turn if you send him to the engine room, while also building up research points.\n\nIt's a brilliant little game with many paths to success, provided you have the patience to learn.","January 20","true","6.2"," 14 of 20 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","14","20","0","0"

This is that sort of game.  Investing dice in outcomes, and bad investments = doom.\n\nThis is a logic puzzle game.  There are 10 turns, and you have 4 crew.  Each turn, the crew will have 1 to 5 dice to roll - and that number is dependent on your choices in the previous turn.  The trick is to utilize the special abilities of the crew in conjunction with the special dice slots in each chamber of the ship to maximize the number of dice you get each turn.  The events that happen aren't the same every time, but the number of events that occurs each turn is a set pattern.  Two things break, another two, then three, then two, etc.  If you make wrong choices about spending dice to fix a broken system or using them to generate more dice for next turn, you will lose every time in turn 3.  As soon as you learn to survive that, you're on your way to winning a game.\n\nThere is some randomness, but even terrible roll results can be put to good alternate use.  You just have to learn what your options are.  Since so much of this is intentionally a mystery when you first pick it up, it might look like a wicked hard game that hates you and is impossible.  However, once you figure out the things to NOT do, you can get a 50% win rate pretty easily.  If you really understand it, you can be one of those people with an 80%+ success rate.\n\nThe fun of the game is climbing that difficulty cliff.  Progressing from "this is impossible" to "this might be doable" to "I see what I should have done instead".  Just remember... more dice next turn, even if you have to let the ship burn a little.  As problem solvers, we're conditioned to "fix everything" but this is a puzzle of limited resources and risk mitigation.  If you follow your "gamer instincts" you're gonna lose.  Also, don't ignore the research pool.  Some of those are miracle cures when all hope is lost otherwise.\n\nInvest your dice wisely and you'll be fine.\n\n","January 27","true","1.3"," 14 of 20 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","14","20","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/AkiAkki/recommended/323060/","AkiAkki","Aki","http://steamcommunity.com/id/AkiAkki/","38 products in account","Honestly I want to love this game. It has great aesthetics, a great UI, good concepts to work with. It's unique. And from the looks of it this seems like the first time that Choice Provisions has done a game like this.\n\nThe story is decently done, though it is essentially predictable the moment you reach the halfway point. The music is nicely done, but it doesn't fit the tone the graphics and narrative are trying to set.\n\nUnfortunately, the core mechanics, as a person who has been playing and GMing many Tabletop RPGs for almost a decade, I can't help but feel these mechanics are unbalanced and poorly designed. I've let some of my other friends who play tabletop games with me play, and here's a lot of the points we've discussed.\n\nYou're guaranteed to have an event that penalizes you for having high rolled dice. This completely contradicts the notion the rest of the game is setting ("you need these high rolls to succeed") and furthermore punishes the player for being lucky. It's just a bad game design from the start. Alex Neuse (creator of Choice Provisions, formerly Gaijin Games) told me that this was primarily to "create tension and deperation," but the fact remains that there are other ways to do this without contradicting your own game mechanic design.\n\nAlmost all of the game is out of the players hand, and into a RNG. There is little the player can do that isn't determined by RNG. Actually, only character selection is free from some influence of RNG. Your avaliable research projects are RNG, to get the one you want you have to spend points to let the RNG replace the ones you were given. The event system is made up of "a complex system that takes into account the status of players and the ship," also known as RNG. The dice throws are physics based, but the initial throw vectors for said dice throw are made from, you guessed it, RNG. Now, normally this would be irrelevant and even a positive if the system was balanced well. If the system was balanced well.\n\nThe RNG system is in desperate need of balance. Now, Alex Neuse told me that there was a wish to keep the rules of the game simple. I'm not going to spend forever lecturing this single topic, so I'll just make my point clear with this: There's a reason why popular Tabletop RPGs like Dungeons and Dragons, Vampire: The Masquerade, Call of Cthulhu, and others have rulebooks that number in the hundreds of pages. It's not because they want simple rules, they want fair and balanced rules. Tharsis had the advantage here; they have a drastically reduced scope, they could be short and fair. But because they wanted the simplest rules, the game is full of small inconveniences, the most prominent being assists being automatically used when the result was acceptable. Beyond that, there are multiple times where players are given situations that have a less than 1 percent chance of success without research project (which they didn't have anyway). Why would that kind of probability be on NORMAL difficulty?\n\nThe current balancing systems are woefully subject to RNG. THIS is the biggest problem I have with the current balancing system, and why it seems to fail so badly, why the game falls flat on its face without any error on part of the user. This is due to any of the cases like, getting immunity to a penalty during the end of the week choice and not having any large portion of the new events using RNG, wasting research points on shuffling the randomly given project until you get the one you want (and find out that you can't get the points for it), having an event where rolling a high number takes off 3 health and not having the ability to get the project that gives immunity to said penalties (injuries need 6 points anyway so it's essentially unattainable anyway), having to shuffle your resources so much that getting assists or other perks become impossible to do without destroying the ship, being given nothing but choices that will enevitably lead to game over the next week. All of these things I have described are things that can't be blamed on the player, because they are almost completely determined by an RNG system that is independant of the player. And that's the biggest crux of the issue, the "fallbacks" that keep the game from being frustrating and completly unfair aren't guranteed to have any meaningful use because they aren't guranteed to work when they need to. When you balance an RNG, you have to do it in a way that is independant of RNG to prevent it from being useless. When a mechanics controls the system that is supposed to govern said mechanic, it will most likely break, as it does in Tharsis.\n\nWhen I play Tharsis, I don't feel releived when I "win," nor do I feel disappointed when I "lose." Because everything is so out of control of the player, there's little for them to do; it's not difficult because so much of it is simply not of their own doing. What strategy and risk/reward assessment there could have been is simply blind hope. I can't assess risks that havent hapenned yet, so how can I even assess what reward could come of it? I am stuck hoping I made the right decision, but at the end of the day, I can't know until it happens. And that frustrates me, because a strategy game is one where I am supposed to be able to understand to some degree the consequences of my actions. When I finally won, I felt frustrated because it wasn't my skill that let me win, it was the system that controls the majority of the game throwing me just the right combination of elements that led to me winning. And that makes me boil inside. I can't win by my skill, I have to hope that the game well let me win.\n\nSo perhaps the worst problem of them all is that Tharsis failed to give me any form of CaTharsis.","January 13","false","4.7"," 32 of 54 people (59%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","59","32","54","3","0"

For example, use the low dices on research, re-roll research, double 1s or 2s on ship reapair/food, 1 for 2 extra dices for next turn in life support, etc. Rolling low doesn't mean bad all the time. It is all about how to use it as you advantage.\n\nRandomness (luck) is a fun element in most of the games. Do you want an ARPG with no luck element? do you want a card game every one get same cards? I guess most people say NO to this.\n\nI think the developers did a good job on this game, using dice based (luck) on a game, but you can usually get around it (skills/knowledge) to make progress.\n\nLast but not least, I do recomment this game, if you want some challenges. The learning curve is not bad, just some youtube videos or play a few games will get you on the rail.\n\nEdited: some typo, a bit more info","January 27","true","22.3"," 14 of 21 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","14","21","0","0"

I mean holy ♥♥♥♥ is this game brutal.\n\nIt's essentially just a dice game, there's nothing about it that couldn't be done on tabletop.\n\nYou're on a ship that is falling apart (significantly)faster than you can repair it and you have to juggle your crew members and limited dice pool in order to fix up the ship as well as replenish the dice so that you can still act in later turns.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/UVMwBBBmnYU\n\nIf I had a main complaint about this game, it is that it feels like playing a board game the first time around. There is a lot of text thrown at you right away and everything just feels super overwhelming. Even with the fact that it is a videogame making it more automated I still felt very  confused the first run and the tutorial was more of a basic crash course (no pun intended). But, much like a board game, after playing it once or twice you just kind of get the hang of it.\n\nAnother thing to note is that (as far as I know of, during time of writing) the entire game is based around one scenario right now. They feed you bits of story as you survive each day but once you've seen that day's story there's no point to watching it again. Different storylines would definitely help a little in replayability (there's gonna be a lot since it's gonna take a lot of plays to beat anyway), hell maybe improve the side-projects system to maybe branch the story out a little?\n\nGraphics: The game supports 1527p and during the 7 or so missions played I didn't notice any major frame drops.\nLooks-wise it is pretty decent, nothing amazing but it does the job well.\n\nSound: The sound effects are pretty good, parts of the game are quite quiet and ambient which is alright considering it's a space game but sometimes when you're fixing things up there's a faster track that runs which kind of feels out of place to me but that's just me.\n\nGameplay: It's a dice game. The basic idea is events occur all over your ship and you have to juggle your crew members to go fix them. All crew members have their own dice pool which goes down by 1 every time you use them. These dice can be replenished via food, science, ship functions, or crew member abilities all of which require you to invest the much needed dice. When you are unable to complete these events you will suffer the displayed consequence at the end of each turn until you do complete them, these consequences will either damage your rather fragile hull or directly hurt your crew members. There are other mechanics such as certain numbers being randomly selected as critical failure rolls where if you roll said number you will activate an effect such as the dice being locked to that result, the character suffering an injury, or the dice just being pulled straight into a void.\n\nThere are a couple more mechanics to utilize but at the end of the day, even with amazing management, this is a dice game. RNG will still play quite a major role, you can mitigate some of the luck reliance in early game but later the events occur in such large numbers and require such large total dice rolls that relying on luck may be your only option.\n\nOverall: Would recommend this game for anybody who enjoys dice games or resource management games... if they are also a bit self loathing. This game is insanely brutal and the fact that you aren't entirely in control makes it even worse, I feel less stressed playing Dark Souls and I am fairly bad at fighting games.","January 15","true","2.2"," 16 of 25 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","16","25","0","0"

I want to stress the word RANDOM. That means you will lose and lose a lot because the game randomly decided to make you lose. The same as when you roll dice in real life and they land however they land. Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose.\n\nIf you do not like to lose, then do not buy this game. Your crew will die, your ship will explode, and you will lose the game because of a completely random bad roll of the dice and it will happen often.\n\nOk, if you are still interested, then the game does have other elements to it besides random dice rolls. You can use research cards with special abilities that help. Each module on the ship has a special ability that can be activated, and there are random events that occur in between turns that have choices that can help and hinder you. Your crew also have a different special ability each.\n\nThere is a easy and quick tutorial, gameplay is pretty straight forward and does not vary much throughout the game. You will get random events that you need to roll dice to resolve. These events themselves can be many different random things, but besides the random hazards, they all are resolved the same way by rolling dice. Hazards can be putting your dice in "stasis", "voiding" your dice, and causing injury to your crew if you roll the number associated with the hazard.\n\nThe dice themselves represent your crew members "energy". They can eat food or use abilites or cards to get more dice.  With no dice (energy) the crew will not be able to fix the ship. The ship itself has a health bar as well and when it takes too much damage from events not being fixed it will fall apart and its game over. Another mechanic that comes into play is crew stress levels. The higher the stress, the crazier the crew member gets and possibly worse consequences will follow if they do not destress.\n\n\n\nI tried to cover as much as possible. Overall I find the game to be interesting and fun. It does get somewhat repetitive after playing it for a bit, but I am still having fun playing a round or two every once in a while after over 10 hours so far I have put in. I am also excited to see what the developers will offer for DLC.\n\nIts fun and I would recommend the game to anyone who loves to play dice. I also like the space theme too so that helps some. Good game for the price in my opinion. Good Luck!!","January 19","true","13.1"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","0"

I never encountered any bugs or glitches, and that is something I really appriciate. It feels well made in a technical sense. At no point does it feel like they overreached, and I think that is laudable. I think indy devs commonly make the mistake of trying to do too many things and then they run out of funds inevitably and you end up with something half baked. This is fully baked. Enough said about that.\n\nI'm not sure what I would categorize this game as, but it's not a rogue like. Initially I was looking for something similar to FTL in some way, but this is not a game like Faster Than Light in any way. In some ways it's a better game. It has a better presentation. By that I mean high quality visuals used to make great art direction shine. That combined with the music, and the way they present their story leads to an atmosphere that is thick, heavy, brooding, tense. I believe my little characters are in a desperate situation. I really appriciate that they were going for a sense of realism in their presentation even if the premise of the game is somewhat fantastical. I think it works very well.\n\nIt's a good game for short stints. Half an hour here, ten minutes there, perhaps the most atmospheric one armed bandit ever made. That's kind of how I see the game play, as sort of a Rogue Gambler.  Or a terrifying game of dice. Survival Jahtzee? Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose, and that is partly luck, though I wouldn't get back to it if skill wasn't also a factor.\n\nMy only critizism is the placement of the toturial video button. It is terrible. I must have clicked that button a hundred times by now, just because it is placed where one would expect a "NEXT" or "CONTINUE" button to be. It's so prominent and clicking it is a muscle memory thing for me. This has never happened to me in any other game. Please, for the love of all that is holy, move that button to the left, or top of the screen.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrshifty/recommended/323060/","mrshifty","Matt","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrshifty/","381 products in account","Tharsis is a digital board game; there are no mechanics here that could not easily be recreated in cardboard. In table-top terms, Tharsis is a cooperative, dice-drafting, worker placement game with player elimination. Like all cooperative games it can be soloed by having one player play all roles, and Tharsis the videogame does not provide any other option, though it's easy to imagine multiplayer coop being possible. Dice-drafting worker placement is experiencing a surge in table-top gaming recently: Marco Polo and Grand Austria Hotel are popular new games that use this mechanic.\n\nTharsis's unique mechanics are 1) it is cooperative and 2) you do worker placement (by choosing a module to deploy your character in), and then draft your dice within that module. Cooperative worker placement has been done before with, for example, Robinson Crusoe.  And module-based worker placement is being done in, say, Tiny Epic Western, which is currently being Kickstarted. But combining those mechanics with dice drafting provides a pretty unique boardgaming experience. Events and research opportunities are randomized, as are the dice obviously, which provides plenty of replayability.  The game is challenging to win, but would be boring if it wasn't.\n\nI'm thoroughly enjoying my time with the game. It's got macabre humor, solid mechanics, good presentation, replayability, and a sizable challenge. I recommend it for fans of thematic Ameritrash board games, but even more for Euro-game nerds who like a dose of randomness in their strategy.","January 12","true","2.1"," 24 of 42 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","24","42","0","0"

A high difficulty combined with a punitive RNG system just makes the game way, way too hard to be enjoyed. Often, your dice pool is incredibly low after your second turn and you end up with ridiculous situations where you just want to give up.\n\nFor example, you must repair a module with a total of 27 points. That wouldn't be so bad, but said module also has stasis on 1 dices, void on 6s and injury on 5. So you constantly lose your best rolls, get stuck with unhelpful dices you can't re-roll and if you're very unlucky, you'll roll a bunch of 5s that will kill your crew mates. I don't want to imagine what hard mode is like, really. This isn't an isolated occurence, it keeps happening over and over when you reach Turn 3.\n\nWhile the game is simple enough in term of mechanics and the visuals, as well as the cutscene help setting the tone, this game will need a lot of fine tuning before it can shine properly.","January 12","false","0.8"," 33 of 60 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","33","60","0","0"

I played the game several times before I beat it and then I started to beat it pretty consistently and the only time I really fail now are when I do something really stupid, take a gamble, or on the rare occasion the game just puts all odds against me.

If you luv these games you will like Tharsis.\n\nMaking a real choice in dice games is the tricky thing to build into RNG (Random Number Generator) systems. I mean, if you roll a 6 and a 3 why would you ever choose the 3?  If there is never a reason, (no, reason is the wrong word, strategy is better) to choose a 3 then there is no real choice at all, just you sorting through numbers being spat at you by the RNG. One way this could be addressed in Tharsis is in the 'assist' system.  You are given a limited number of these things called 'assists' that stop bad things happening to you - Great - but the system applies these assists no matter if you want it to or not.  It does it strictly by the book of logic in a way that often does not help, it is wasteful of this limited resource, and removes an element of choice.  'Do I want my assists to  save my guy from suffering damage while on this space walk to fix the oxygen leak, or do I need to save those assists for the fire that just brorke out in med bay?' Right there is a choice, and choice is the hardest thing to include in a RNG game.\nOther then this minor grump I think this game is a little gem. Takes maybe twenty minutes to play a mission, and you will have completed the mission to Mars successfully after maybe ten run throughs.  Now I know the game I win maybe 1:4 of the time. It has characters to unlock and cool multiple endings.  Recomended. Two shooting stars (thumbs) up... oh wait, one of those shooting stars was my lander modual burning up :(","January 16","true","17.8"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

They are all based on the same "issue": The game is very hard, the game is impossible, RNG hates the universe and specially me, etc etc etc...\n\nNow that's not a reason to say a game is bad. There's a plethora of excellent games in history which were tough as heck, yet they still were brilliant. I wouldn't qualify Tharsis as Brilliant, but certainly it is very, very ,very good for what it is, and a very solid value for the money.\n\nSo what is it?. Tharsis is actually a board game, and should be approached as such. It requires you to think hard about managing your resources, requires you to plan for future needs vs current problems, it requires a solid risk assessment. It requires all that and yes, even then now and then RNG will screw you up even while you took all the correct measures. But that doesn't detract from the game, it adds up to it in more than a way.\n\nTharsis is not a long game to play. A single run won't last for more than 30-45 minutes so if RNG screws you up you don't lose anything, just hit "new game" and go at it again. And quite honestly for each time I've been screwed by bad RNG (and it happens) I can name another where RNG saved my ♥♥♥♥ in extremely grin scenarios where survival seemed almost impossible. RNG gives and RNG Takes. It just happens that most players are used to games mouthfeeding them, and also have a short memory, they only remember when things went sour, they don't recall the times they were insanely lucky.\n\nTharsis offers relatively short games (a succesful run might take 30-45 minutes only) with huge replayability thanks to the variety of events that you'll be facing, to the RNG nature of the rolls, and to the fact that there are several unlockable crew members which allow for a variety of tactics and different approaches to the game.\n\nDon't expect to win in your first run. Nor in your second. Nor in your third. In fact don't expect to win at all until you become familiar with the events, the crew skills, the ship modules and what they offer, and you can choose between crew compositions. Once you're at that point you'll be ready to win...as long as you play well. A bad choice will make you lose. And a good choice might still lose you the game (RNG!), but more times than not if you're good at assessing your chances and options, RNG won't matter...too much.\n\nSo as long as you accept that sometimes things will go wrong even while you did great choices....Is it fun? Hell yes. Is it addictive? Oh boy it is. Is it challenging?. Extremely and it's even more fun because of it. Is it replayable? Heck yes.\n\nIs it a worthy buy?. If you like board games, risk and resource management, and are ready to accept the RNG nature of it, it's a must buy.\n\nBut if you want a game you win by default every time you hit "play", a game where following the same steps will mean victory no matter what, or a game that guarantees that if you play well you'll win all the time, then better look for something else because no, Tharsis is not like that.\n\nBut as I said...for what it is, is a very very very good game.","January 20","true","57.1"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

Basically, it uses a dice placement mechanic where dice rolls are used to mitigate against impending disaster and if you are lucky improve your situation by gathering more food, improving the ship or gaining you assists (which help prevent bad things happening).  If you are familiar with co-op or solitaire board games such as Ghost Stories or Robinson Crusoe then this game will appeal.  When you first start playing, the game is brutal but it rewards intelligent and continued  play.  The luck of the dice do play a part in this game but the various different options available, which astronaut you use to solve a dilemma, and intelligent dice placement mean that in most games you can survive until you are at least close to making a landing.  That being said there is the odd frustration when you play well only to be thwarted in the last round when the dice gods kill your astronauts just before landing.

I just wish I could see more of the story to tell you about. The idea here is that you're a crew of astronauts on their way to mars, your ship is hit by some space junk and all hell breaks lose. Not bad so far.\n\nYou know enter into a resource/ event planning game mode, where your roll dice to solve issues like the food room being on fire, or the engine room being broke. If you don't fix one of these events something bad happens to your crew. Be it losing hit points, sanity, dice, or the ship taking a hit. If you ship complete breaks you lose and if all your crew dies you lose.\n\nNow with that out of the way let's look at what I liked and didn't like about this game.\n\nPros:\nFor the first couple rounds I had fun in this game. I know it was a hard RNG based game, that would require some planning to get through. My first 10 or so games went pretty bad with me only getting as far as turn 3. Soon though I start to understand how to manage the events and my resources better and i got as far as turn 6. Even though i was losing every game I played I had a plan. I was sure that the 4-5 other lock characters that you can unlock in the game would increase my chance to win. I was ok, i get it. The Devs added a way for people who can't figure out this game really fast a way to grind through objectives to unlock more characters, thus meaning a better chance to win. Neat!\n\nCons:\nHere's the thing though that's not what those characters are. They do not simply become part of your crew as i thought, but instead replace someone on your crew. This means you are always locked at having only 4 characters. This topped with the now 20+ loses i have had in the game with little progress has really turned my opinion of the game around.I felt completely helpless to the point of not enjoying this game anymore. I could understand if the mode i was playing on was hard or something, but i was on normal. On normal and getting to the point of wondering if this game is worth the frustration. So i looked through the discussion page to see what others are planning and talking about. I got a few ideas from people but nothing different from what i had already figured out on my own. The one thing that really struck out to me though was the conversation the Devs were having there. Which pretty much went like this, "there is nothing wrong with the game, we want it to be frustratingly hard, and we do not have any plans to change that.". While I respect a Dev for sticking to their vision of their work, I can't find the ability to complete this game. Making it a must return for me and not play again. In fact I will most likely avoid this Devs in the future cause i now know what kind of games they like to make and they aren't for me. I am not the target audience. I am by no means a casual gamer but when my fun time becomes more stressful than my job or relations in the real world, then it is to much.\n\nIn the end, if you like extreme (and i can't state that enough extreme) challenges get this game. It looks like a lot of fun from all the videos i watched and my first playthrough was fun, but it claws at you over time. If you're a braver person than me this is the game for you otherwise I would skip this and get something else.","January 14","false","1.7"," 27 of 51 people (53%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","53","27","51","0","0"

While some people think they aren´t very different, I think the game changes on hard level.\nOn normal you can control everything, if your skill is refined and the risk of losing a game due to very bad luck is small. Mostly you made some bad decisions, if that happens.\nOn hard level this can happen without making a mistake und you will often have to take risks in the best way to get the best chances of survival. Luck gets a little bit more important here.\nCharacters could be better balanced, because some are clearly better than others, so chosing your party influences difficulty, too.\nMy conlusion is: Tharsis is a little gem, a very intelligent game, where subtle tactics and understanding of risks against odds makes the winner. Everyone who thinks, that the dice controls the game, hasn´t understood the mechanics of the game.\nAnd as a little game for in between it has a lot of replayability.\nGreat game 10/10\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTharsis ist ein Würfelspiel, dem es gelingt, dass der Spieler auf raffinierte Art und Weise die Chancen zu seinen Gunsten beeinflussen kann.

So wird auch das Glück hier etwas bedeutsamer.\nLediglich die Charaktere könnten etwas besser gestaltet sein, denn die sind doch etwas verschieden stark, so dass auch die Auswahl dieser den Schwierigkeitsgrad beeinflusst.\nTharsis ist ein unglaublich intelligentes Spiel, wer meint, dass hier allein die Würfel über dein Schicksal entscheiden, hat keine Ahnung.\nUnd als Spiel für zwischendurch hat es zudem einen hohen Wiederspielwert - für mich wird es ein richtiges Juwel bleiben.","May 24","true","195.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I came here looking for a co-op board game like pandemic or Ghost Stories, games which it is impossible to win every time even if you finess everything, if you happen to pull the wrong card or roll the wrong dice you are out.\n\nIf you treat it like one of those games, maybe invite a mate around and discuss which is the least awful thing to do first over a beer, then you will have a good time.\n\nIf you wanted a pussle which you can learn to beat every time then you will hate this game, but please dont leave a negative review because the game is great.\n\n9/10","January 18","true","5.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Its almost like you have zero chance. The crew starts off in bad shape and you have no time to just help them out while repairing all ten new modules every turn. SImple fix, increase the time to mars, and give us a turn or two without taking damage randomly inbetween. I understand the history you are trying to immitate, but even those stranded at sea had a breather at the beginning and a few times throughout. Also who the hell in Nasa would just set a course straight into an area known for micro meteors. Even if it happened, why wouldnt the crew steer the ship a few degrees in either direction to get out of the micro meteors path?

It is very difficult at first, but once you figure out what to do its not as hard as people say. It is very satisfying actually. My first playthrough was hard as hell but my second was a cakewalk (on normal, I am now ready for hard).\n\nSome tips to get you started:\n- you can still use dice that are in stasis! Maybe I was just being dumb but I didn't realise this on my first couple of attempts.\n- some events are fine to just leave. For example if you get a -1 Food event but currently have no food its fine to just leave it and concentrate of fixing the other problems. Same goes for events that just disable the systems in a room that you weren't going to use anyway. The rooms will become available again once you fix the event.\n- the +1 dice by commander and +1 health by doctor are very powerful! It's all about getting the turn order right to maximise the benefit of these abilities.\n- know your probabilities and have a plan. Before you deploy anyone to a room take note of how much dice and health everyone else has. Just assume everyone all will roll a 3 and calculate that you will be able to fix a room with more than 50% chance.\n- assists are actually important. Deploy to rooms with injury and void first if you have assists, stasis is just an annoyance but wont hurt you as much as the other things.\n- stress is important as it determines the choices you get between turns. Do use the -stress room if someone is on high stress (and you have no urgent rooms to fix) and do use the -stress to all crewmembers research options, they are one of the best.\n- don't be afraid to put dice in research and use any research options that are useful straight away, such as repair room (lifesaver), -stress, +dice, +food. Don't keep saving your research points for later. Don't be afraid to use a research point to shuffle research options when 2 out of the 3 options are crap or not useful in your current state of ship/health/food. When you use research it always takes away dice starting from the smallest number, so it is a good way to put those 1s and 2s to good use!\n- try to never waste dice. So you have some dice (such as 1s and 2s) that you can't put anywhere useful and you can't reroll. Use some research options that are good for next turns such as +food, +assist etc to free up room in the research bar and then put your unused dice there.\n- use the power of maths to figure out best dice allocation!\n\nThat is all.

It is a dice based game, so you will see some "unfair" situations, just like you will see some incredibly beneficial rolls. There is a fair amount of balancing done, and you have to work to understand the systems at play.\n\nThe tutorial does a good job of going over the basic systems and how to play the game, but there are deeper levels of strategy necessary to win, and it will take several tries or watching someone else play to be able to beat it for most.\n\nIn terms of content, the story is sadly a bit short, though there is a promise of more "missions" coming soon. Unlockable characters are present as well, so there is a fair amount of replay.\n\nThe art style is nice, if a bit basic and and the ship is not too busy. There are lots of nice little details, and I especially enjoy seeing my astronauts floating around a damaged module frantically trying to repair it as I work with a different astronaut.\n\nTLDR: Hard, but fair. Lots of RNG. Not a lot of story, but decent replay value and the potential for expansion. Graphics/art are adequate, but not bad either.

These are very brutal & random games that you have to go into expecting a majority of time you are going to fail. A majority of the time you will perish even when you may think you are doing well, but sometime that's just the luck of the die. It really bums be out to see a lot of these negative reviews, while it's regrettable some people are not enjoying that game I can't help but feel like most of them didn't really understand at all what it was before they purchased and what to compair it to polished/extremely balanced video games they are used to playing instead of chaotic random table top games it is designed to emulate. I for one think Tharsis is an incredible achievement in bridging the game between the two and I can't wait to see more of what Choice Previsions will put out. I highly recommend if you like the randomness of dice or difficult games!

But like all great games that are difficult, you learn the most from failure. And boy, you will fail a lot! Luckily, Choice Provisions has made the journey so enjoyable that even when you make the wrong call and the game ends, you can't wait to get back in and try a new tactic you figured out during your last run.\n\nIt's been compared to a board game because of the dice and UI, but for me the best comparison is a roguelike game that focuses on survival rather than fighting. As in a roguelike, the path to success hinges more on discovering what kinds of problems to ignore or brush past for the time being, and what kinds of measures you can take to last as long as possible during future problems\n\nThe dice can be very unkind, so it's a good thing they look and sound excellent! It is legitimately fun to throw the dice, even when you're sweating bullets because you're about to make a life or death throw. Additionally, the soundtrack is the perfect ambient compliment for this game. I found it stuck in my head so much that I bought the album it's taken from immediately.\n\nIf you love challenges, puzzles, overcoming odds stacked against you, and space cannibalism, this is absolutely the game for you!\n\nMaybe I should have mentioned the cannibalism earlier.","January 28","true","4.7"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Games that require you to stop and think about HOW you're going to proceed.\n\nLuck is CERTAINLY involved here, but there are ways to mitigate the bad rolls and events you don't want to see happen. the challenge is trying to figure out those stratagies and last longer (or get a higher score then your borther and friends are likely to ever reach and be a ♥♥♥♥ about it) then in your pervious run. I think a lot of people will be turned off by the difficulty due to the dice mechanic, but when you think about it, games like FTL or Out There can fall into the same "impossible run" situations. You just don't feel as in control of your fate in this game because the crap shoot is pulled to the forefront instead of hidden behind lines of code\n\nIn terms of atomsphere, the creators really nailed a good mix of hopefullness/fear on the crewmember animations as well as giving the game a tense feeling, mitigated by an upbeat and slightly energetic soundtrack that's stuck in my head. for me at least it gives a sense of "you can make it just a bit farther, just don't give up".","January 28","true","6.0"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

You take care of the ship as dangers / hazards lurk in every "corner", such as meteoride strikes that might shred your ship into pieces. The game is all about keeping both, your ship and crew UP AND RUNNING.\nKeep repairing the ship and keep the crew members fed, by any means necessary.\n..Yes, the game actually allows you to resort to cannibalism if you run out of food.\nHow do you do this all exactly?\n\nBy throwing a dice.\nYes, you control everything that your crew members do by throwing dices, so the gameplay is very much dependant on your luck. Although there is actual strategy and other elements to it as well.. You need to make wise decisions, you can't just throw dice and hope for the best, well you can and you will but that alone won't be enough.\n\nBefore I get into Pros and Cons I want to address something everyone else has already addressed, but I just felt like giving my piece about it too..\nThe game is ridiculously difficult, and I'm not even talking "Dark Souls" difficult..\nDark Souls games are somewhat fair, while this game REALLY isn't.\nIt's not about me sucking at videogames or me not liking a little challenge, but from the very start of this game I had the feeling that "I have no chance".\nI understand that they're trying to go for a really dark and grim setting but the game is simply unfair, to the point where you are actually unable to enjoy the game to its full extent.\nFor example, every new "event" comes in a weekly basis, in game I mean..\nAnd there has never been a single time where nothing too bad actually happened.\nEvery event I get hit by Meteoride strikes, food gets poisoned, ships heating doesn't work,\nthere's a leak here and another one there.. ALL OF THIS AT THE SAME TIME!\nNow, you're able to do other stuff around the ship, freely..\nHarvest some food, recover some health, reduce stress etc.\nBut you NEVER get the opportunity to do any of these things because your ship is falling into million pieces and your crew members are munching on each other.\n\nI love the setting and I love the challenge but this game needs to give the player a break, a chance. Give some hope, give us some light so that we can see in the darkness.\nBut this is just, literally hopeless.\nApologies for ranting that long but I just had to get that out there.\n\nPROS :- Some decision making\n- Voice acting is well done\n- Atmospheric and relaxing soundtrack\n- Interesting mechanics and aesthetics\n- Crew members all have different roles that they can put into good use around the ship\n- Replay value pretty high because events always happen differently and there's plenty of unlockables\n\nNEUTRAL :- Dark and grim setting\n- Very dependant on luck\n- No satisfaction from surviving through a week, only relief\n\nCONS :- You can't do anything without throwing dices\n- Game is way too challenging and punishing in my opinion\n- Injuries happen way too often and most of the time prove to be fatal\n- Characters themselves have no voices or personalities for that matter\n- I might be a bit nitpicky right now but as the characters die their bodies just disappear\n\nTo end this review,\nI think this game is too challenging and unfair right now to be of any enjoyment worth 10 dollars.\nBut I have hope that the developers will make some changes,\nand if you see potential in this game, you might want to give this game a chance,\nbut don't say I didn't warn you. Oh and, if you're someone that cannot fathom losing,\nwhat are you even doing here? Get out.\n\nI RATE : 6.45 / 10.00","January 20","false","5.9"," 32 of 61 people (52%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","52","32","61","0","2"

It's more that the systems and solutions available to players are not all immediately obvious. Mashable's review said it best when they complained that "the game doesn't do a great job of preparing new players for the trials to come", and I agree wholeheartedly with that.\n\nYou can let a problem go unaddressed one round, damaging your ship by 1 damage, because you've set your engineer up in the maintenance room and his rolls bumped the ship's health up by 3. You can improve the sustainability of your crew by having one in the cockpit room to remove movement damage when you have crew in less-than-ideal positions for some challenging problems. Being aware of your assist count going into a challenge, and prioritizing problems with damage or void modifiers for your assist usage can mean the difference between life and death.\n\nUltimately, this game does a great job of creating a very rigid, parseable system to play in and an even better job of making you feel like every decision counts, because they do. I'm reminded of games like Darkest Dungeon when I play, and for me, that's a really good thing.\n\nI know this level of punishment isn't for some people, and there is absolutely nothing wrong with that!

It has surprising layer of depth, even when the game might suggest you need to fix all highlighted problems first, it's not always the smartest choice. The game offers mechanics like 'assists' to prevent damage or other penalties on bad dice roles, which really prove to be life savers. Yes, it's a very difficult game and yes RNG totally has the potential of screwing you over in only one turn, but it does seem like there are ways of lowering risks to such an extent that it's possible to beat the game. I don't think every single game you start can be won, but that might simply be me not seeing the optimal solution. As said, sometimes getting a bonus by rolling (high) dice in a different section of the space station is essentially the only way of solving the events that threaten a destruction of the space station.\n\nAgain, it's a hard game and you'll fail a lot. But I'd imagine that fits the theme quite well anyway.\n\nI kind of hope to see more content and it seems they have 'missions' planned, for there is a button in the game that still reads 'coming soon'. Not sure what we can expect, but I kind of hope to see a few more 'scenarios' that include 10 more turns with a different goal and different struggle. All things considered, the game is a little bit lightweight on content IMHO, despite being extremely replayable. It's priced accordingly, but I think they probably should keep it 10 bucks to increase overall value.\n\nI'm also going to wish for;\n-more stations (because while it certainly looks very good and works fine, we only really get 'one level' with randomised events)\n-variety in missions / goals (which may come with the 'missions', which aren't in the game yet). Mind you; the random events in the game have a good variety and are quite perfect.\n-more astronauts to choose from, the roster with everyone unlocked is a bit lightweight for a game like this with a total of 9 or so.\n-add a mode or function where instead of getting one turn closer to Mars, you'll add an additional turn in which you fix up the ship, before going to the next 'harzardous turn'. It's an amazingly tense game, but not fixing problems in the last turn will make it nigh impossible to solve all problems in the next. Ie. the snow balling effect is kind of harsh, which is probably the reason why people complain about this game being too difficult. Obviously, adding such a 'delay' turn will lower the final score. But it might ease the problem of 3 events destroying a fairly healthy space station in a single turn. Of course, the whole danger if part of the fun, so I wouldn't want to see them lowering the difficulty. Just give us a tad more options influencing the RNG.\n-(or alternatively/additionally) add the option of SWITCHING/POWERING OFF modules temporarily, so they in fact won't do damage to the ship that turn, but of course still have an impact on the game. For example, switching off the medbay means it won't function in healing crew, but might give you like one turn longer to prevent a -2 health for everyone penalty which would make you lose the game.\n\nI'm hoping the developer continues adding cool stuff to the game. It's formula deserves an even greater, more in depth experience. And so far, I can totally recommend the game. It's a lot of fun. It's tense and it requires to make the most of what happens. It's a great risk management game. It's a good strategy game. It features canibalism. It's original, despite being essentially a boardgame. It's the best boardgame on PC I've played ever, which says a lot. Totally recommended! 8/10","January 15","true","1.8"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","8","14","0","0"

There are a handful of resources to manage in this game: the ship, morale, food, and indirectly the positioning of crew members. The most important resource, and perhaps unfairly way too important, is food. Every other resource is most efficiently gained with excess food by spending excess dice on the locations and this isn't communicated too well. Eat immediately and generate food on your first few turns, even if you have to leave a crisis, and the rest of the game is easy as you'll be able to keep every crew member above 3 dice.\n\nThe game is not impossible and I tentatively recommend it for presenting themeatically brutal choices. Replayability is also a large concern, as it appears weak with a dominating strategy. The balance can be made more dynamic, perhaps easing up when necessary, and increasing if not. My first win actually had all crew members survive with 0 stress, full bellys, and even a fully repaired ship.\n\nThe risk management is mostly fine, the only thing that screams unfair RNG is rolling injury hazards. The rest of the game is difficult resource management, with food perhaps trumping the rest a bit too highly.","January 15","true","2.2"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","8","14","0","0"

Luck plays a huge part in this game, as in any dice game, but there are enough strategy elements in the game, to offset at least some of the bad luck you will inevitably encounter. Just like a good roguelike game, don't expect to win this game until you have invested some time into the game to learn the game mechanics and the sparse strategy elements available to you. There is less strategy than most roguelikes, and more luck, but as you play the game and your score increases, the level of satisfaction that you get in achieving those higher levels of mission success are much sweeter than your average dice game.\n\nMy only quibble with this game is that I think adding RPG elements to the game would have improved the game's stragetic element and put it closer to the roguelike genre which is how I would classify this game overall. For example, solving an issue could gain an XP point which could be used to improve a stat, or add to the card selection or buy some food--something along those lines. This would add extra value to winning an encounter and offer a reward for sucess that the game is lacking at the current moment. Even if you win an encounter, many times there are simply no rewards for success which I think does detract somewhat from the games overall playability.\n\nIf you like roguelike games, you will like this game. The idea is the same, along with the level of frustration and since of sccomplishment. It is a hard game, by design, but also addictive and frustrating fun.","January 17","true","6.1"," 9 of 16 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","9","16","0","0"

It is -really- difficult, though, even on the normal difficulty.  I almost think it's needlessly difficult.  The game would be hard enough without such huge penalties for rolling void, stasis, and damage dice.  If you get unlucky and run across a room that needs a high number to repair and also end up with 2 different dice that will void and another that will damage (which happens a lot), that means you are pretty much toast.  There's a 50% chance on every roll that you'll either lose the die completely or injure yourself.  I think the losing one die per turn no matter what is a bit harsh as well.  I understand the mechanic and how it ties into food, but without cannibalism I don't see how you stand a chance.  And even then... well, you really don't.\n\nAdjust the frequency of the stasis, void, and damage dice and I think it'd improve things a lot.  I don't see why -every- encounter needs to have those come into play.  It's a fun enough game and concept that it would retain its replay value beyond beating it... don't be afraid to let people win once in a while.  Still, for the price it's fun enough and it's pretty rewarding when you make it through a round with no damage.

As a gamer who enjoys the following fairly common game categories: difficult, turn-based, tactical/strategic, rogue-like, Tharsis hits all those notes. Unlike a lot of games, every turn involves a LOT of choices, and the ramifications of those choices goes much farther (as each successive turn is dependent on the previous turns -- what disasters you resolved, how much resource/dice/health your characters have, etc). Any review that complains about a lack of decision in your actions is probably not taking into consideration everything that you could (and probably should) consider when doing your turn.\n\nThe difficulty is, I think, overstated. My success rate in this game (~65% on 25 Normal games) is much higher than FTL for instance. That's more than fair. There's a learning curve, and there's some luck, but it's NOT impossible.\n\nI think some of the negative feedback on the game actually comes from its unappealing mechanic of cannibalism. If the game was instead dealing with 4 robots on a mission, where the robots had the option to become a little more "unstable" by destroying one robot and distributing its chips to the remaining ones (effectively masking the cannibalism feature but keeping its game mechanic), I think that would be a lot more palatable for players (and I would probably do it more often myself).\n\nI would encourage folks to form their own opinions of the game, and not be too influenced by the mixed reviews (including mine). The biggest recommendation that a player can give to a game is their time, and I'm stilling enjoying this game 20+ hours in.\n\nAs an aside, I plan to post a few playthroughs on my channel:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/acodachannel\n\n","April 20","true","43.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Here's how it went.\n\nPlaythrough one: There's a story! Must be just the tutorial. I really dig the visuals in this game, and damn is it hard as hell just like I've heard. Still, it's a dice game built as a cooperative board game of sorts...these are never easy. Wow, I lasted three weeks! Let's try another round.\n\nPlaythrough two: Oh, the story is presented every time? Interesting. Haven't done the new Missions yet, will try them next. This time I think I get it more. You need to plan ahead who is going to be in what module. You have to make sure you're actively trying to use those research projects, always gathering assists because Void and Injury will mess with your day. Think about the functions of each module too, and the bonuses you could get, but keep that Food up or you get no dice.\n\nPlaythrough three: I get it now. I've got the rhythm. I am having a good time playing this game, I do wish some mechanics weren't QUITE so punishing, but this is very reminiscent of a traditional board game played cooperatively against a board game AI. It's tough, but there's a sort of slogging method to it that eventually you sort of fall into...or you never fall into. It's a game for a specific type of gamer.\n\nLuckily, that type of gamer is me. I am looking forwards to the updates to Tharsis, and I will recommend it to anyone who really enjoys traditional game mechanics (yahtzee, poker, both present here), a difficult yet understandable design, and some pretty smooth visuals.

I do not recommend it for everyone, especially the Darkest Dungeon / FTL / X-COM crowd.  You will not find as much here as you might be looking for.\n\nTharsis is a "risk-management" game in the same vain as X-COM and like listed above.  You have a crew of four people on a space-ship, and each turn are tasked to fix a random assortment of events that pop up.  Each event requires a certain total dice roll to fix.  The task is to fix these events, or at least enough so that your crew   / ship does not die / explode.\n\nThere are more details like food, stress, and other factors, but over all this is a game of dice.  Each crew member has a different amount of dice to use per turn, and the choices that come from this become interesting.  This is the heart of the game.  Do you send your captain with 5 dice to attempt to fix an event that  will damage the ship next turn? Do you send him instead to the medical bay, hoping to heal him enough for the future?  Do you risk sending a low health person into a room where they take damage because the event will kill everyone else?\n\nI find the core concept very enjoyable.  But I need to stress for the Darkest Dungeon / FTL / X-COM crowd: This is a much shorter and simpler game.  A typical game might take about 10-20 minutes.  There are a couple of unlocks, but not else.  Once you get the formula and how to win, there is not that much game left.  Games like FTL have so many variables and unlocks that you could play for 100 hours (as many have).  Tharsis can be tapped out in about 10 or so.  Personally I like this simple, repeatable format, but it is worth being said.\n\nThis is not your next 1000 hour addiction.  But it could be something to boot up every once and while, make a run at Mars for ten minutes, and try again later.","February 4","true","16.8"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

It's been demonstrated that the randomness of this game can be overcome by good decision making and this has also been my experience. If you enjoy a random element in games, this game is great. If you're the type of person that gets angry at missing a 95% shot 1 in 20 times - you probably won't like Tharsis.\n\n2. The game currently is about the $ 1/hr threshold. I beat the game multiple times and it was an interesting experience each time. The developers are also adding new missions (for free) to round out the content.

What I like so much about this game is the amount of critical thinking you have to do and decision making to survive, Its very strategic and I believe the game is very balanced in that regards despite what other say about how insane some scenarios can be.\n\nIt took a little over an hour but it went by so fast and I will be definitely playing more rounds after this. It has great replayability.\n\nThe game is refreshing in its style.. Of course alot of it is RNG and i had a bit of luck on my side but I never felt like it was impossible to make it one more week with the correct strategy.\n\nI really hope the developers expand to this series and ill be more than happy to support this game.\n\nfor the price of this game the value you get is beyond worth it.

Let's get started.\n\nFirstly, the game system is great, simple but strategically deep (do not let anyone tell you otherwise). The randomness of the events do keep you on your toes, but preparing research items, saving food and fixing the ship ahead of time is possible, and I would say necessary.\n\nSecondly, the randomness and difficulty are two of the things that make this game good. They are not detrimental to this game. Take into account that this very same game with a 1 in 3 or 5 win ratio, would have almost no replayability value. Unlockable crew members are nice to try out, only got two of them so far and they do change the way you play, but trying to beat the odds are what make me want to play again and again... and again. I just finished my 14th game in less than 6 and a half hours. Take into account that I took my time to think every move the first three or four games, and I went AFK with the game open a couple of times.\n\nHaving said that, I found no reason to call the difficulty "punishing" as many others have (even in positive reviews). I confess that I love rogue-likes and other types of very difficult games, and am not pushed away by any number of defeats if the game is actually winnable at some point, but 2 wins in 14 games, and the second one with all 4 crew members on Mars, not having succumbed to cannibalism, tells me this game is not that hard if you get your mind into it and learn all of the possibilities in front of you.\n\n"Mission accomplished"... What a rush.\n\n---EDIT---\n\nForgot to leave one tip: Keep stress low, it's important.","January 17","true","15.4"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

The fact that surviving the end of one turn can come down to just one dice roll makes this game difficult but extremely enjoyable. It is not easy, you will lose many times. The thing that keeps me coming back is that each game poses a different set of challenges each time.\n\nAnother good thing is that the look of the game is beautiful, the developers really put in the time for a lot of detail and animation that you may not see in similar games. I would never think that I could appreciate an animation of how dice roll in a game, but it's satisfying to see every time.\n\nThe mechanics of the game are very appealing, and having unique ship areas and character abilities adds great depth to the game. It takes some time to get used to what exactly each mechanic is, but they are straightforward after one or two playthroughs.\n\nTHE NOT SO GOOD:\nI wouldn't say any part of this game is bad, but there are improvements to be made.\n\nThe game is HARD. I beat it on easy difficulty, probably because of luck honestly, and I can't even imagine beating it on the harder difficulty. One reason (as pointed out by other users) is that your ship can sustain an insane amount of damage on one turn, effectively killing all of the crew or destroying your ship. It could be balanced somewhat better, but that being said it isn't broken.\n\nThe length of the game now is pretty short, it would be really cool to see future updates with longer scenarios, new ships, etc. It is possible to unlock new crew with different abilities, and it says on the menu that missions are coming in future updates. That being said, each playthrough can be unique, but you are limited to being on the same ship every time.\n\nPersonally, I'm not interested in the story cutscenes. They don't pique my interest all that much, but they do add some to the overall atmosphere of the game.\n\nPRICE:\nAll in all, great game with great potential. I think it's worth the $15 base price, but definitely worth a try for the sale price.\n\nTL;DR\n8/10 - Would cannibalize my dead crew again.","January 16","true","7.5"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

It's about risk management. Many players do not seem to understand this. Yes, dice rolls are random, and can screw you over, but the game is about using the most out of every thing you're given.\n\nEssentially, you and you fellow crew of space travellers are stranded on a doomed ship after a cluster of meteorites struck it. Your goal, is to survive 10 turns, while all hell breaks lose. During these turns, you use your crew to repair various sections of the ship. Not fixing these areas often has catastrophic consequences. The worst cases being that your ship either explodes, or your crew dies. To fix these areas, you roll a group of dice, whose collectice value represents the amount of repairs a crew member can make at once. If you pass a randomized thresh hold, you fix the section, and no penalties will inhibit you. If you fail, you'll need another crew member to come in and complete the needed repairs.\n\nThis sounds all nice and easy, except that their are a multitude of resources and factors that can slow you down. Hunger being the primary one. Your characters carry a maximum of 5 dice at once. After completing an action, their total number of dice reduces by 1. This introduces a sort of fatigue system, where your crew gets worse and worse. However, if you feed them, they'll immediatly recover 3 maximum dice. The problem is that food is scarce, and fairly difficult to procure in large amounts. with 4 crew members, it can be difficult to get everyone working effectively.\n\nAs you could imagine, the luck of the draw can come into play here, as practically everything is related to dice rolls. However, there is a mechanic in the game called research. Effectively, at any point when you roll dice, you can choose to sleight them into a research tray. At any given time you'll be given 3 "cards" which you can spend research on to unlock for a once use consumable. For example, if you have a 1, 3, and a 5, you could sleight each into research, and allow you to unlock a card with a maximum cost of up to 3. Each of these cards helps you do various things. By preemptively stocking research, you can prepare for the storm thats coming later on down the road.\n\nAgain, the game is about budgeting your dice accordingly. There may be scenarios where its better to leave parts of the ship damaged, while you work on resting and getting food for you crew. The challenge however, is in finding the best solution to a run. Tharsis is almost like a puzzle in that regard. Indeed at times, it may be impossible to win, but you shouldn't let that stop you, as thats how dice games work in general. Its what makes it special. I just finished a run where I got so many 1's and 2's, and high count repair rooms that my head was spinning. However, I managed to scrape by through the action of killing and eating one of my squad mates, a liberal use of research cards, and pumping everything I had into repairing the hull with nothing but super glue, duck tape, and spit. It can be hard to get that decisive win, but when you make it its extremely rewarding.","January 16","true","13.1"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

While initially it seems like everything comes down to chance there is actually a lot of strategy involved.\n\nBasically you have 4 characters, they each have up to 6 health and they can each have up to 5 dice to roll per turn (they also have a stress meter which I assume you never want to hit full but I haven't seen what happens when it does as I've been pretty successful at managing that). You want to keep this number as close to 5 as possible as the more dice you have the more successful you will be at handling the random events that pop up (each event has a negative effect from merely preventing the rooms ability from being used, to damaging the ship, to reducing dice pools, to reducing character health). Usually you will get 2-3 new events per week.\n\nEach event can have up to 3 numbers on the dice that if you roll them will have a negative effect. There are three possible effects, Injury (1 damage every time the dice shows that number, this can also be the same number I've had 3 injuries if I rolled a 6 for example), Stasis (the dice is locked and cannot be rerolled, I've never seen this with a numerical value higher than 3 presumably because nobody would be rerolling higher rolls anyway, this never has duplicates), and Void (if your dice has the void number it is removed from play).\n\nDice can be used for a number of things, your crewmembers ability, the rooms ability, repairing the damage (every event has a repair number which is reduced toward zero as you use dice to fix it), or research (basically accumulating dice to buy a special ability).\n\nThere are two resources you can acquire, Assists (prevents a bad dice effect from occurring), and Food (gives +3 to the dice pool of whoever you use it on).\n\nYou have to juggle all of these variables and the random elements in order to get your crew (or at least one of them) down to Mars in 10 weeks. It is definitely doable although sometimes the negative effects accumulate too quickly for you to succeed.","January 17","true","4.9"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Then this is the game for you. I would compare this game to Elder Sign (a game I love), except that Tharsis has more choices with more signficance to make. Similar to Elder Sign, each character rolls dice and then allocates the dice to fend off certain doom. After each character goes, then the game takes it's turn and terrible things happen to you. Also similar to Elder Sign, characters move from location to location, each location having an effect on how you can use your dice and what positive results you will get for defeating it.  This game is not totally luck based. There are a lot of choices to make with your rolls or you can press your luck and re-roll. I am loving this game and would buy a physical version if they made one. So, if you like punishing board games like Ghost Stories, Space Hulk: Death Angel, Elder Signs or Defenders of the Realm then you will like Tharsis.","January 17","true","2.1"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Rather, it is a game that you play merely to consistently make the best choices with the tactical scenarios and dilemmas presented to you. Every action comes with a cost, and the game is about carefully weighing the net outcomes of every action, the roll of the dice, and some tactical gambles you make on your own volition.\n\nPlayers can use several mechanics to augment their attempts to save the Tharsis.\n\n1. The first is research. The research pool allows you to put dice in it in order to get special abilities, effectively allowing you to "save" dice to get special abilities in anticipation of a rainy day. These special abilities can be reshuffled at the cost of one die, or when used, the individual slot refreshes.\n\n2. Every one of the ship's modules have a special ability, ranging from repairing the ship and replenishing food and dice if you roll enough of the same die, to one off bonuses that can help you get out of a sticky situation, such as removing stress from one team member, healing to full health, or maximising squad assists to negate environmental traps (void, injury or stasis that applies to specific die results).\n\n3. Crew members have special abilities that can be handy at the right moment, such as moving throughout the ship without taking damage, replenishing assists, reducing stress, adding die and a few more.\n\n4. At the end of every phase the crew's stress levels are calculated, and low stress crew provide sensible "tactical" packages that will affect your next turn.\n\nEvery bonus comes with a drawback however. Healing a squad mate to full may mean using a valuable dice that rolled a 5 to heal him instead of contributing towards reducing damage that's destroying the entire ship. Getting more food may mean sacrificing ship integrity. Replenishing assists may mean sacrificing a crew member as that lethal gas leak remains unfixed, so that another crew member gets the chance to safely fix the re-entry vehicle.\n\nExpect a lot of mission failures, some of them right at the beginning of the game. However, also expect many brilliant saves. Expect the making of hard choices and solving difficult dilemmas, as you drive the crew to reach planetfall at all costs, up to the point of cannibalising the dead, or euthanising the weak or dying for food.\n\nTharsis is a game of mathematical dilemmas and tactical options that come with a cost as you struggle to survive, like playing a chess game with the board itself always changing and in a way that stacks the odds against you, where you must use all your ingenuity to merely consistently make the best decisions with the scenarios presented to you. Recommended if you like unforgiving but winnable quick games that you play mostly for the difficulty.","January 18","true","28.1"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

The fact that surviving the end of one turn can come down to just one dice roll makes this game difficult but extremely enjoyable. It is not easy, you will lose many times. The thing that keeps me coming back is that each game poses a different set of challenges each time.\n\nAnother good thing is that the look of the game is beautiful, the developers really put in the time for a lot of detail and animation that you may not see in similar games. I would never think that I could appreciate an animation of how dice roll in a game, but it's satisfying to see every time.\n\nThe mechanics of the game are very appealing, and having unique ship areas and character abilities adds great depth to the game. It takes some time to get used to what exactly each mechanic is, but they are straightforward after one or two playthroughs.\n\nTHE NOT SO GOOD:\nI wouldn't say any part of this game is bad, but there are improvements to be made.\n\nThe game is HARD. I beat it on easy difficulty, probably because of luck honestly, and I can't even imagine beating it on the harder difficulty. One reason (as pointed out by other users) is that your ship can sustain an insane amount of damage on one turn, effectively killing all of the crew or destroying your ship. It could be balanced somewhat better, but that being said it isn't broken.\n\nThe length of the game now is pretty short, it would be really cool to see future updates with longer scenarios, new ships, etc. It is possible to unlock new crew with different abilities, and it says on the menu that missions are coming in future updates. That being said, each playthrough can be unique, but you are limited to being on the same ship every time.\n\nPersonally, I'm not interested in the story cutscenes. They don't pique my interest all that much, but they do add some to the overall atmosphere of the game.\n\nPRICE:\nAll in all, great game with great potential. I think it's worth the $15 base price, but definitely worth a try for the sale price.\n\nTL;DR\n8/10 - Would cannibalize my dead crew again.","January 16","true","7.5"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

It's about risk management. Many players do not seem to understand this. Yes, dice rolls are random, and can screw you over, but the game is about using the most out of every thing you're given.\n\nEssentially, you and you fellow crew of space travellers are stranded on a doomed ship after a cluster of meteorites struck it. Your goal, is to survive 10 turns, while all hell breaks lose. During these turns, you use your crew to repair various sections of the ship. Not fixing these areas often has catastrophic consequences. The worst cases being that your ship either explodes, or your crew dies. To fix these areas, you roll a group of dice, whose collectice value represents the amount of repairs a crew member can make at once. If you pass a randomized thresh hold, you fix the section, and no penalties will inhibit you. If you fail, you'll need another crew member to come in and complete the needed repairs.\n\nThis sounds all nice and easy, except that their are a multitude of resources and factors that can slow you down. Hunger being the primary one. Your characters carry a maximum of 5 dice at once. After completing an action, their total number of dice reduces by 1. This introduces a sort of fatigue system, where your crew gets worse and worse. However, if you feed them, they'll immediatly recover 3 maximum dice. The problem is that food is scarce, and fairly difficult to procure in large amounts. with 4 crew members, it can be difficult to get everyone working effectively.\n\nAs you could imagine, the luck of the draw can come into play here, as practically everything is related to dice rolls. However, there is a mechanic in the game called research. Effectively, at any point when you roll dice, you can choose to sleight them into a research tray. At any given time you'll be given 3 "cards" which you can spend research on to unlock for a once use consumable. For example, if you have a 1, 3, and a 5, you could sleight each into research, and allow you to unlock a card with a maximum cost of up to 3. Each of these cards helps you do various things. By preemptively stocking research, you can prepare for the storm thats coming later on down the road.\n\nAgain, the game is about budgeting your dice accordingly. There may be scenarios where its better to leave parts of the ship damaged, while you work on resting and getting food for you crew. The challenge however, is in finding the best solution to a run. Tharsis is almost like a puzzle in that regard. Indeed at times, it may be impossible to win, but you shouldn't let that stop you, as thats how dice games work in general. Its what makes it special. I just finished a run where I got so many 1's and 2's, and high count repair rooms that my head was spinning. However, I managed to scrape by through the action of killing and eating one of my squad mates, a liberal use of research cards, and pumping everything I had into repairing the hull with nothing but super glue, duck tape, and spit. It can be hard to get that decisive win, but when you make it its extremely rewarding.","January 16","true","13.1"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

I've played for about a day now, and I've been able to win about two out of 15 or so games. It's honestly pretty frustrating at times, and mastering it seems to be about weighing various risks and rewards for what you can control, of which there is precious little. Aside from the risk management, there's a fair amount of luck, and often, it seems, you just get unlucky with the dice.\n\nIn truth, I can't really judge a game based purely on its style of play, and Tharsis seems to be a pretty decent entry in the dice-based genre, and so I give it a thumbs up overall for that reason. But it does get a little stale after a dozen playthroughs, since the back story, cut scenes and ship design are all the same every time. The focus is really the dice-based decision-making, with the ship and storyline just being secondary backdrops for the gameplay. I think this game could be more with some added variation of the game world.","January 31","true","19.3"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Let's get started.\n\nFirstly, the game system is great, simple but strategically deep (do not let anyone tell you otherwise). The randomness of the events do keep you on your toes, but preparing research items, saving food and fixing the ship ahead of time is possible, and I would say necessary.\n\nSecondly, the randomness and difficulty are two of the things that make this game good. They are not detrimental to this game. Take into account that this very same game with a 1 in 3 or 5 win ratio, would have almost no replayability value. Unlockable crew members are nice to try out, only got two of them so far and they do change the way you play, but trying to beat the odds are what make me want to play again and again... and again. I just finished my 14th game in less than 6 and a half hours. Take into account that I took my time to think every move the first three or four games, and I went AFK with the game open a couple of times.\n\nHaving said that, I found no reason to call the difficulty "punishing" as many others have (even in positive reviews). I confess that I love rogue-likes and other types of very difficult games, and am not pushed away by any number of defeats if the game is actually winnable at some point, but 2 wins in 14 games, and the second one with all 4 crew members on Mars, not having succumbed to cannibalism, tells me this game is not that hard if you get your mind into it and learn all of the possibilities in front of you.\n\n"Mission accomplished"... What a rush.\n\n---EDIT---\n\nForgot to leave one tip: Keep stress low, it's important.","January 17","true","15.4"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

The game is based around making decisions, calculated risk-taking, and developing contingency/backup plans around the various dice roll outcomes that can happen - those are the skills that the game encourages you to develop. If you choose to play this game, yes, there will be times when you get unfavorable dice rolls, but there will also be times when the dice fall your way too. Based on my playtime, the dice rolls seem random, not weighted to make things more easy or difficult for you (although I have yet to try Hard mode).\n\nRegarding other aspects of the game such as presentation, graphics, sound - these are all solid, although ultimately unremarkable.\n\nIf I had to compare this game to another, I'd say it feels somewhat similar to FTL.

If you do, what makes this game better than others with the same mechanics is the attention to detail graphically, and the art style of the cut scenes is wonderfully paired with the voice acting (notice that the narrator changes if your captain dies). The whole story is very well paired with the mechanics.

It's not designed well in terms of replayability .. one play-through might take maybe 2 hours .. and yes, it's a brutal game so you have to have a few tries to get a winning play-through.\n\nBut once you have done it .. you're kinda done with the game.  Yes, you can unlock other characters, so you might get another play or two out of it .. but it's a bit of a "once you beat it delete it" title\n\nSo for me the only consideration is the price tag versus the amount of time/fun.\n\nI think it's a good game otherwise, so giving it a positive score .. now you should weigh up whether the $15 is worth 2 hours or so worth of enjoyment.  (I think so .. but I just think of how much I'd spend if I went to the movies or something)","January 18","true","2.9"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

If you get it for something less than 8 Euros (or regional equivalent), then  I'd call it a 10/10 for value/money.\n\nLong Version - If you dont like tabletop mechanics, mainly resource management and dice management, this game isn't for you. If you do, what makes this game better than others with the same mechanics is the attention to detail graphically, and the art style of the cut scenes is wonderfully paired with the voice acting (notice that the narrator changes if your captain dies). The whole story is very well paired with the mechanics. All in all, its a game to get in any sort of sale, and maybe even without one, if you like board games, or theme of space horror.\n\nEDIT: I was shocked at how many negative reviews there are. Most of them seem to be about how unbalanced the game is. And its true, as any game with randomly generated obstacles, it will sometimes hit you exactly where your team is weak. Still, I'd suggest that you dont blame the game for your lack of knowledge about dice odds.

These opinions are my own.\nAfter 30 games played, I won 0.  Thankfully games are short and won't make you feel like you've wasted a chunk of your life.  Instead you study what happened and consider alternatives for the next game.  True, it's very Random Number Generator (RNG) heavy because the entire gameplay revolves around dice rolls and the random events that occur.  There are strategies to "help" you win the game, but since I've won 0 so far, I couldn't say if my strategies are solid.\n\nOne must consider that, although the game may put us in impossible situations, not all games are impossible: they just look like it.  Sometimes the best option isn't the one staring us in the face.  Maybe instead of using that die to repair the module, you can put it in your science as you have a card to repair more than the die value is worth?  (Ie: Roll a 1, but you have a card that repairs 3 for the cost of 1 science.  Your roll of 1 can be that science, and repair 3 in the end)  Perhaps taking one for the team is also the best option.  Consider that the less crew you have, the greater benefit from cannibalism.\n\nDevise a strategy, see if it pans out.  What matters most at the end of the day is that even after losing 30 times in a row with absolutely 0 wins, I still found the game enjoyable!  I fear the replay value after I win, though.  Definitely a fun experience for those that don't frustrate easily and want to offer themselves a challenge.","January 15","true","10.2"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

The first few runs are about learning the ropes, but once you figure out how to minimize risk and which choices are the best to make, winning becomes much more plausible. Even after winning quite a few times, I still feel like there's good replayability. I'm unlocking the characters and soon moving onto hard mode.\n\nWhat I love most about this game is the tension felt on the characters' faces, the tension of the dice rolls, of waiting to see what problems pop up next. When those tensions release, the feeling is hard to match in many other games. The aesthetic of this game adds so much to this.\n\nI'm also a person who doesn't have a ton of extended periods of time to game, Tharsis is great because a full run can be completed in about a half hour. You can also Save & Quit midway through a run.\n\nTo anyone who complains this game is too hard or too random, there's currently a guy who is on a 28-0 winning streak, beginning with his very first game (DragonDave17).","January 25","true","23.2"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","1"

On my first ever playthrough I made it to mars with 3 surviving crew members out of 4. EDIT: Technically all 4 crew members were alive on the last turn but one of my crew members needed to fix the module she was in, in order for the ship to survive while the other 3 made it to the module that was going to launch. This made the game even more engaging for me:END EDIT: The people who are complaining about the balance of the game...it's a game of chance. That's what dice rolls are. It's how you use those dice. Do you re-roll? Should you hold some? Or put some in research? There is much strategy and prioritizing involved. This takes skill but not a tremendous amount. I mean that as in, it's very accessible for anyone unsure about the format. One bit of advice, don't hastily put dice in areas until the very end of the turn or when you're completely sure of what to do. Example I had to get I believe 14 and I had enough dice to get 14 and put two dice in research. One of those die was a 1. I had thrown the 1 in therefore wasting a dice that could otherwise have gone into research. Not terrible, but things like that can decide the game. Putting an extra or wrong dice somewhere, or putting one somewhere and changing your mind can be frustrating but no more than throwing a crumpled paper into a trash bin and missing. Negative reviews say a lot about a game as well. I recommend reading some if you're still unsure after reading the positive ones. They may shed more light. You would perhaps see that many are just annoyed by losing or the no win situations, which actually are winnable if you've thought ahead and prepared and such. This is an amazing game, just not for everyone obviously. I highly recommend this to any video game lover but especially those who enjoy strategy. I'm a huge fan of RTS games like Rise of Nations, AoE, and AoM. I also  enjoy turned based games such as Civ V, and I like board games, my favorite being Axis and Allies Spring 1942 Second Edition. I just include that to maybe give an idea of what other games I like that perhaps are reasons I like this game so much. If you're a fan of board games, especially war ones like A&A where dice rolls mean everything but are random, you'll like this. Especially because there is so much you can do with your dice.

I was however disappointed and off-put from trying the game out personally when I saw such mixed reviews, particularly concerning RNG and how some people claim the game was just flat out impossible and/or unenjoyable.  This is particularly true when I met such a seemingly impossible run in my first game and immediately lost on the third week.\n\nFortunately I persisted with another game (followed by many more) and was pleasently surprised that my previous worries were largely unfounded.   I beat the game after a couple more failed attempts and even started streaking (on normal mode).  I still lose sometimes, sure, but with most losses I find myself reflecting on my potential lapses in judgement and alternate solutions rather than cursing failures - something I find very enjoyable.\n\nThat said, there are admittingly some situations I think are flat out impossible (that first game I had 4 systems with 15-30 damage giving -1 or -2 health to all crew on the third week, rolling straight voids with my most fed crew members).  Luckily I don't run into them often (especially since I try not to let problems stack up any more) but even when I do get horrible RNG it's usually funnier than anything else (especially when you consider the chances of it happening are).  Still, be prepared to lose some games!  It's like FTL and X-com I/I in that way where the real risk of absolute failure, especially when it can feel controlled and prevented, really pulls a person in to keep playing.\n\nSummary:\nTactical and strategic game\nElements of RNG require adaptation\nSome games you WILL lose (or can seem that way anyway)\nGreat music/art\n\nLastly the game is fairly short in terms of an actual storyline currently (expect 2 hours tops if you beat it in one run) but more missions and an endless mode are in the works.  As long as you enjoy what I've outlined above though, the game never really feels over and instead has plenty of replayability (think boi/ftl but without the need to collect items).  This is a game I will likely be playing for a long time.\n\nPS: One complaint I'll add is that I wouldn't mind having my win % on normal mode separated from my win % on hard mode.  It's vanity, but I'm really quite vain <3","January 27","true","11.7"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

I think Tharsis is sorta getting a bad rap here due to the 'randomish' factor people complain about.  I believe most of that is due to not quite understanding the strategy of the game enough.  Its about risk and resource management; your die, your food, your health and your ship hit points.  Tharsis crew placement and die generation is key to winning.   If you do these things poorly you will lose most missions.\n\nSending your crew to certain comparments to utilize their special ability isn't always the smartest play.  A best helpful tip, IMO, is on turn one generate as much food or die as possible.  So long as you have one health per crew and 1 ship hit point after turn one you should be set for the rest of the game, in most cases.\n","February 1","true","23.1"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

You will be given no-win situations, which is fine, but when a majority of games end because there was nothing to be done about it, it kinda makes me feel like the only reason to keep playing is to hope you get lucky next time. Unlike a lot of very difficult games, Tharsis probably won't get much easier over time for most people because almost none of your failures are your fault. Saying it is difficult is not quite correct, it is either impossible or it isn't.

I will admit, it is very difficult, and luck plays a big role in the outcome.  Good planning and strategy will only carry you so far.  It is not impossible though.  I lost my first game on turn 4 because I didn't really know what I was doing, won my second game, and lost my third game because of one exceedingly unlucky roll in which I got three fours to come up out of my five dice, killing my captain, stopping him fixing a damage to crew which killed a second person, followed by all of my between round choices involving damaging crew members, which killed a third person.\n\nWasn't anything I could have done about it without precognition, was pure bad luck that I lost.  But it was fun.  It was a big thrill to roll the dice and know that so much was riding on it.  And the loss was quick.  This isn't one of those games that strings you along for 20-30 minutes making you think you can limp along when you really can't.  When you lose, you lose, and you start the next try.\n\nDespite all I said about luck, stragety is very important in the game, and can add a big boost to your chances.  Proper use of crew's abilities, especially the captain's it seems, will allow you to help mitigate a large amount of the luck that occurs.  So sure, in the end, it is a roll of the dice if you win or not, but you can do a lot to set up how many dice you have, and what else you can do in addition to just rolling the dice.\n\nYou'll lose, a lot, quickly, and sometimes despite the most flawless of planning and execution, but the games are quick and fun, and the knowledge that so much rides on your roll makes it very exciting.","January 22","true","1.6"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","5","9","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Adelas/recommended/323060/","Adelas","Governor","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Adelas/","105 products in account","Hey guys,\n\nAfter playing this game for solid 4 hours straight, I believe I've got a pretty good grasp on what the game is about! So here we go:\n\n---- Pros ----\n\n- Excellent graphics, it really is an artistically satisfying game that really excels in the module screens and dice effects, including spraying blood all over your 'board' when you eat your crew mates. In addition to this, it runs really well, not getting too much lag or anything on a MacBook, so happy with that :)\n- Moderate learning curve, and when I say 'moderate' I mean you'll spend the first 30 minutes working out what the hell you have to with all these dice, and all these abilities, and then it'll all generally make sense. And from there, your fate is in the hands of the RNG gods.\n- Diverse, you'll always be thinking "What the hell is "OAM Failure" ? and then finding out that the most vital part of your ship is on fire. Or the fire containment systems aren't working...because they're on fire. It makes for an entertaining game that always seems to surprise you with words and disasters, and then adds insult to injury by blocking 4,5,6 rolls on a 30 repair.\n\n--- Cons ---\n\n- Difficulty, this game is incredibly difficult. Out of 30+ games I've played in 4 hours, I have yet to get past Turn 8. It is not for the faint hearted, or those who dislike being in tough situations. You WILL choose to eat your crew mates at some point, and you will smash your desk and yell "Why?!" but if you can handle the severity of the RNG God's wrath, you'll do fine.\n- Dependance on RNG, as I mentioned above, it is 99% dependant on what you roll. You can have the most skilled crew with full dice, but roll all 1's on a 1 Injury roll and lose one of them. Or receive 3 25+ repair problems in one go. It's 70% RNG, 30% strategy, and even then your strategy is dependant on what the RNG throws at you.\n- Repetitive, the game becomes repetitive quickly, and you seem to find yourself repairing the same module that you repaired 2 minutes ago, and then suddenly everything is on fire. I've quit many games turns before I would've lost due to the ability to see I'm going to lose. The game becomes predictable in everything but the dice rolls, and how hard it's going to make you rage.\n- Price, at the price I bought it, AUD$9-ish, it's worth it. I enjoyed my time learning the game, and enjoyed my time screaming at it in agony, but in its current state, it is not worth more than that due to the inevitable repetition that comes with a game based so heavily on RNG.\n\nConclusion:\n\nOverall, I would recommend this game due to the fact that it is literally less than a week old, and in its current state, it is a great game, if not annoying at times. I don't know what the devs are like, but watching their videos that they've released, they seem quite into the game, and I believe that they will listen to the community and really make the game a space strategy, not space monopoly.\n\nCheers for reading, peace!","January 12","true","7.6"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

If anything this game left me frustrated and unsatisfied. At least in other bruitally hard games you can make the right choices or use skill to overcome the dificulty but in this no matter if you make all the right choices the game will crush you so hard.

Similar to cooperative board games such as Arkham Horror, you'll face overwhelming odds that require smart allocation of your limited resources. Four crew members, each with their own unique ability, are chosen from a pool of astronauts and each one represents your actions within the ship. It is up to you to decide how to best utilize them and, thanks to the very random nature of the game, the tactics and strategy behind a successful run are going to change every game from one to the next.\n\nHard mode requires nearly optimal play with a hand-picked crew but even the normal game is no walk in the park. Tharsis is a game that successfully walks that very thin line where the balance is just on this side of favoring the player. Making mistakes more often than not means entering a downward spiral where mission success is impossible. Don't worry though, runs are relatively short so many attempts can be made within a single play session.\n\nEven once you develop a strategy for consistently getting to Mars, Tharsis continues to provide a challenge through random crew selection, hard mode, and missions (which are one-off challenges presenting the player with unique scenarios). Then again many players break before even reaching this point as more than half the people who played have never made it to Mars. Some have even gone so far as to call the devs liars about the balance of the game and claims that it can be consistently beaten without relying on luck. The game's balance has been proven by the community though, many of them able to beat the game at will.\n\nSo to say Tharsis provides a challenge is a bit of an understatement, but at least it's a fair challenge. The question is if it's the right kind of challenge for you. It's not the type of challenge you can headshot your way out of, and it's not something you can cheese by exploiting an imbalance. It's just you and the dice. You know what your average roll is going to be, the question is if you can get the most value out of high rolls while finding a use for the low rolls.","February 29","true","14.4"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

If this argument was valid than games like Nuclear Throne, VVVVVV, N and Spelunky should have very poor ratings.\n\nThe next assumption is, that it takes luck to win the game. Currently a streamer has a winning streak of 17 games and he’s still going. That would be impossible if luck the primary mechanic of the game.\n\nAnd finally - Tharsis is not “Brutally hard” at all. It is quite possible to win 4 out of 5 games on normal level. It does require thinking, planning and an understanding of probabilities. But this is exactly what a rogue-like dice game should be about.\n\nThe mechanics of the game are quite diverse. You’re controlling a crew of four astronauts. Each of them has up to 6 health points and up to 5 dice. Your ship has up to 8 health points and 7 modules where crew and negative events can be located. Your mission is to bring the ship and at least one member alive on Mars.\n\nThe dice in this game are your action points. Once you deploy a crew-member into a module, you roll his dice and decide how to spend them. The dice are spent to remove the negative events that threaten your ship, to enable special features of each ship, to enable special abilities of your crew-member, or deposited into research bar that enables special actions.\n\nAs an added complication, each turn begins with a choice between two or three options. These will give you more dice but reduce health, repair the ship but increase stress levels of your crew, in various combinations. If your crew has high levels of stress then the choices will get worse. So you should manage that as well.\n\nThe whole game now revolves around managing your resources and prioritizing the threats. Although it seems like you’re quickly overwhelmed with problems, if you make reasonable choices, you will likely land on Mars.\n\nIf this sounds like something you like, then don’t worry about negative reviews and get the game. There’s enough videos around to get a good feel for the game-play and you can always get a refund.","January 17","true","24.3"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

This is undoubtedly due to the RNG and feeling that the game is too difficult as a result.\n\nIn actuality, I think it is not so much that Tharsis is difficult, but rather than it has an initially steep learning curve and the tutorial doesn't explain everything clearly. In the beginning, I really disliked this game and felt it was too random. However, I stuck with it for some reason (probably because I was curious what was going to happen when they got to Mars), and now I have a much greater appreciation for the game. I ended up beating it on my 8th attempt and now have a solid understanding of the mechanics. There is actually a surprising amount of depth between balancing repairs, using modules, and investing in research. The order you deploy your astronauts also makes a HUGE difference. Tharsis really rewards planning ahead and making the most of every die. It's all about making sacrifices and thinking on the spot. There is definitely a pretty substantial RNG component but once you have a good grasp of how to utilize all the systems in the game you'll realize you actually have a lot of control. At the moment I get to around week 8 on average each game.\n\nTLDR: Tharsis is a great game if you give it a chance and take the time to understand how to play. The RNG keeps you on your toes and provides a unique experience each playthrough. Although sometimes the RNG can feel cheap, Tharsis does a good job of providing players with many options to work with and get around bad RNG. Overall I'm impressed with what the developers achieved regarding how much control players are given despite so much being randomized.","January 15","true","11.3"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

Nothing less than that and has a charisma of its own.\nIt is "solitaire" mode in the sense that, unlike most board games, you play it single player.\n\nWhat Tharsis is not is a normal streamlined computer game. It shows you all the calculations, events and results instead of just relying on options and have underlying mechanics to deal with the stuff for you.\n\nNope. You will be making choices while moving your pawns, rolling dice and suffer a lot while seeing the whole plan gone awry because of the random events happening during a hazzardous space trip to Mars. Yes. Pure board game events drawn from a deck or similar.\n\nSo, with 4 pawns representing crew members the player will have to play a crisis management type of game with the absolute certainty that is impossible to solve everything - yes, this is the motto of the game as I see it "You shall not be able to solve everything everytime and someone will have to sacrificed...".\n\nThis might seem harsh to many players but all in all is a great basis for a good anti-hero type of game.\n\nThe graphics and music and sounds are pleasant enough and I can totally see the graphics being illustrations as part of a true to form board game, that's how cool they are.\n\nGiven the price it is being sold and the replayability factor this is a solid buy if you happen to like board games, especially the ones with a original type of rules where winning is important but the choices made all the way to winning is definitely what makes winning more interesting.\n\nRule #1 of Tharsis - You will not be able to beat the events everytime everywhere.\n\nRule #2 of Tharsis - Everytime something different will happen. There are no winning formulas.\n\nRule #3 of Tharsis - FTL has no place here. FTL is not a board game.\n\nTotally recommended.\n\nWould spend more money on great computer board games that show this type of originality.\n","January 13","true","7.2"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

The dice may be pure RNG, but the mechanics have good work arounds for it to make the game a true risk/resource management game. Each crew has a unique ability, each room has a unique ability and research can trigger unique bonuses and events, meaning that despite the dice gods smiting you, its still possible to make bad rolls work for you.\n\nSomething about this game is truly addicting to play (though I dont imagine watching it on youtube would be to enthralling). You will fail, and fail alot. It took me about twenty attempts to finally make it to Mars. The negatives are that the game is hard, even on normal its truly unforgiving. Sometimes you're best just isn't good enough and everyone dies horribly. So if that sounds like something that would frustrate the heck out of you rather than challenge you to try again then it might be best to wait for this game on sale.\n\nThe Pro's: The graphics sure arn't revolutionary but they are actually a good fit for this game. The panicked, flighty looks on your commander when she's on low health, the relaxed semi-stoned look your mechanic has when he's low stress and  is well fed, or the nerotic teeth chattering of your technician after she's eaten too much long pork.\nThe game itself is fun A.F. I've burst into fist pumping fits when my mechanic put out a massive electrical fire single handedly by himself and cringed when the bloody dice remind me that all the energy that crewman has is because they ate their friend. I dont remember their names, they are just skills to me, they die to often. They are mechanic, pilot, doctor to me and a precious source of food when they expire, I just can't bear to learn their names, except for Yuri the Russian pilot who I assume is so loaded on Vodka he goes every where EVA, because why the hell not.\n\nIn conclusion: 9/10 a great time waster with a better ending than Mass Effect 3.","January 15","true","1.8"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","7","13","0","0"

And I'm here to tell you why. The story is you and your crew on a space mission to Mars, when things go wrong...horribly wrong.\n\nYou're in control of four crew members, each with unique special abilities. Each crew member rolls dice to try and meet a total objective cost for a broken module, so you can keep flying. The mission takes 10 weeks, (10 rounds) and your crew will face a bevy of challenges from lack of oxygen to malfunctioning water supply for the food garden.\n\nThere have been many dissenting reviews of Tharsis by the Steam community. People are often enraged at the fact that the game has a lot of luck, and it's too difficult and random because of that. Unfortunately for them, they do not have the strategy skill set or the patience to enjoy the game.\n\nThis game is essentially a cooperative board game in video game form. There are a few underlying strategies that will carry your crew to victory. The key is finding them. And the journey to find them is a rewarding, albeit sometimes frustrating one.\n\nI lost my first 8 games of Tharsis. Then I won my next two. Not randomly, but by the strategy I had discovered. I happen to be a veteran strategy board game player, so I probably found the strategy quicker than some. But when you fail 8 times, and you finally figure it out and make it to Mars, beaten and bruised, the taste of victory is oh so sweet.\n\nIf you like strategy games, this is an excellent one, rich with theme that will have you clinging to  your chair wondering if your crew will survive the onslaught of perils.

I am incredulous at how the game throws cascading, unsolvable, hull damage events at you. It's like being expected to survive a plane disaster where three engines fall off, part of a wing falls off and part of the tail falls off. It's so laughable! You take health damage moving through damaged sections of the space shuttle, which is a huge stumbling block.\n\nIn retrospect, I think that I only made it as far as I did in my second play through because of a couple of lucky 6's ( combined with a lot of thought and planning ).\n\nFine balance tweaks would make this a great game but as it stands, I can't recommend this game and obtained a refund ( I'm on the fence about the refund because I had *so* much fun and honestly want to keep playing it! ).\n\nWhat I'd like to see:\n\n- Tone down the sheer number of ridonkulous hull damage events.\n\n- Make assists more useful ( instead of being automatic negations, allow the player to actually choose which rolls to assist with ).

Here's why: Negative reviews tell a lot more about the game than positive ones, and the negative reviews here tols me this game could be good.\n\nSee, there's this new kind of gamer, bred by the industry's 'no kid left behind' policy that, no matter what they do, even if they randomly click around, they will win in a single player game. That's not a credo upheld by board games. This sort of game aims to give you a challenge, even if you are good at it. When that sort of a player meets this sort of a game, there is frustration. To me, 'challenging' is a good quality, so I gave it a look.\n\nSo, knowing nothing about the game, I lost 8 straight, then won, with 1 crew with 1 health surviving, then with full crew with full health or thereabout on 10th game, all within the first hour of play. Yes, normal mode is fairly simple when you know what you are doing. The odds to win is lower on hard more, of course, and it took 20 odd games to beat it. So this is like a game of minesweeper, you play to the best of your ability and even then, you only win some of the time. That's far better in my books than a game you win all the time, get bored, and throw away.\n\nThe aggrevating thing is that people who know nothing about balancing a game whine about broken balance all the time. This is no different. What is a letdown for me is that there is not enough content yet, but the 'missions' thing seem to be a promise that there is more to come.

Here is my main issue...it is too hard right off of the jump.  Within 2 turns I lost a crew member.  On the second turn I received two problems that were both needing over 20 points to fix.  Then, because I couldn't get them both fixed (with pretty good dice rolls as well), I lost a crewmember.  Then it gave me more to fix and without being able to get any food, my crew had fewer dice to roll.  I wasn't necessarily expecting to get to the end on the first try, but by turn 5, everyone was dead.  It seems as though you have to have a bunch of luck at the beginning to get anywhere near where you need to be by the middle of the game.  Let me emphasize this, the game should be challenging, but this was way too challenging from the start.  You essentially start the game with a crippled ship and a bunch of crew that are at half-health.  Then you have to get food, heal, destress, fix the modules, and fix the ship, all with a bunch of injured and half-crazy crewmembers.\n\nThat being said, the concept is great and the mechanics work very well.  There just should be a little more help at the start and smaller problems to allow you to get moving without feeling like you are struggling from turn one.  My suggestion would be to make the problems escalate the further you get in the game, or at least make a difficulty setting so that those who want to struggle from the start can, or those who want to be eased in can start with easy challenges.  When you go in to a module on turn 4 and three of the six options for dice rolls are injury, it kind of defeats the fun of the game.","January 12","false","0.7"," 10 of 19 people (53%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","53","10","19","0","0"

Or comparing it to FTL or calling it "rougeliek" or any of the other instances of appalling idiocy and ignorance. Rolling dice is not difficult. In fact, a monkey or a child could do it. Because that's all this game is. Beneath the intriguing premise and great presentation, this is yet another lolrandom RNG simulator that's impossible, or highly unlikely, to get to the end of. As much as I wanted to like it, two and a half hours of wasting my time on relentlessly being crapped on by bad luck is quite enough. And in this game, "bad luck" is essentially not getting perfect dice rolls for 20 minutes straight.\n\nPerhaps the developers wanted to make this game "replayable." In that case, I submit they don't quite understand what that means. The game's story is exactly the same each time. As interesting and well done as the cutscenes are, they repeat every single time you play the game. Seeing them three or four times was, again, quite enough for me, let alone the ten attempts I suffered through. And it's not like there's any depth to what minimal amount of strategy there is. All you really do is pray to the RNG gods that a) you get a good starting board (if you don't, just Alt F4 and restart because there's no point in continuing. The game will absolutely give you no opportunity to recover), and b) that you get a not horrible draw of disaster cards and between-round events for the ~8 rounds it takes to finish a match, or "get to Mars." That's all this unfortunate miscarriage of a game is: infuriating BULL ♥♥♥♥ randomness presumably aimed at deranged masochists, with very little thought put into intelligent design or playability.\n\nSince I've gone over two hours, and since I still hold some baseless hope that the game will eventually be fixed into playability, I'm not going to refund it. Not that I would review a game I've refunded on principle, or vice versa.\n\nEdit: After two more hours of desperately trying to salvage this purchase, and 9 more matches, every single one ending in a completely lopsided loss through unfavourable RNG completely regardless of what strategies I used, I think I'm calling it a night.

I think partly because I enjoy boardgames and this plays very much like a solo board game. Graphically it is nothing that special, it looks pretty static, I only learned later on by chance that some parts of the scenery are animated if you click on them. The game play is hard, deliberately so. At first you might be thinking isn't there an easier mode, but part of the enjoyment comes from the fact you will learn strategies that get you a little further each time.\n\nOkay luck plays a big part as well, it is dice based after all, sometimes even you best strategy will fail because of a bad roll, or some damage occurs that you just aren't ready to deal with, but that's part of the fun/frustration as well. Your strategies just help stack the odds in your favour, but sometimes the fates just aren't with you. I've only had the game crash on me once, but I didn't lose any progress, and they are still patching the game at the moment.\n\nWhen you do beat the game there is a real sense of achievement.

The dead astronaut is in fact the one who gets ejected into space in the beginning of Tharsis.\nAt the end of Laserlife, the alien understand the hardship and the sacrifices the humans endured, and since Tharsis also feature a metaphysical alien at the end (with one ending ending with the sentence "The anomaly... It knew".), then it means that they are a single entity.\nSo now, it would mean that they tried to make the humans survive no matter what, because that's what humans would do isn't it? Putting them in an infinite loop of suffering, but with the hope of surviving at the end.\nBut since endless suffering isn't something human they chose to destroy the anomaly at the true end, sacrificing themselves but putting an end at that loop.\n(Reminder: Laserlife and Tharsis are game about symbolism whereas Bit trip runner was about Minimalism)\n\nTL; DR: Not so hardcore, just bear it until you get good, need more content and the story should be less hidden.","January 24","true","8.0"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

You will have to think, hard. It took me seventeen plays to win this game once. I've now won three times out of thirty, including once on hard mode. You will lose, a lot.\n\nThis is a game that - if your strategy is very, very good - you will lose the vast majority of the time. That seems to frustrate a lot of the reviewers, but for me the satisfaction comes from the fact that if you make errors you will lose 100% of the time. A win is a serious achievement, and feels great. I'd recommend it for anyone who enjoys turn-based or resource management games, the mental challenge is the single best thing about this game.\n\nThe gameplay is based around six-sided dice which bounce merrily around your ship as they determine whether your crewman will succeed in fixing the spaceship with some duct tape or be turned into next week's hotdogs (it's theoretically possible to complete the game without eating your friends). This feels incongruous at first but you quickly get sucked into obsessively calculating odds and weighing up payoffs in a way that you might not if the odds were presented as simple percentages. It's a mechanic that keeps gameplay interesting and extremely tense; the feeling of relief when you get your last guy onto the lander in the final turn is a thing of beauty.\n\nThe game is unnecessarily slick and attractive given its genre, with each module very nicely rendered, but that makes it immersive, and keeps you interested in a plot which is barely touched and characters which are not developed beyond a face and a name.\n\nSpeaking of which, the ending is clever and disturbing in the way it rewards a second playthrough, but the whole "meta" thing is a bit too fashionable at the moment (it's everywhere): the plot needed to be better executed throughout to get away with that ending, as it is you can't help but think about a game writer in awe of his or her own cleverness. The whole game evokes a deep, deep melancholy and sense of hopelessness, and is probably not good for my mental health, but it's impressive whenever a piece of art is able to affect your mood in that way.\n\nIf only the scope was a bit grander, or if the characters were developed more, this might have been my favourite Steam game. The ship is claustrophobic, and the game ends when you get off it (or more often when you die): this clashes disappointingly with the epic nature of the plot (first contact with a mysterious entity). I'd love to see a sequel or addition where continued survival on Mars becomes the objective. I'm a little surprised that it didn't come with that in the first iteration, given that The Martian was obviously an influence (in the tutorial you control the ship's botanist, who is promptly redshirted).\n\nI'm off to get a beer out of the pantry.

Most of the games only take around 10-15 minutes based on how lucky you are, and so, with me at least, it's always a case of "just one more game". Tharsis definitely deserves more recognition for what it is.","January 20","true","30.1"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

It's RNG. Accept it. One bad roll can destroy you; that's the risk. But when you gamble on a long shot and win, it feels so rewarding. Couple that with the strategy of chosing where to deploy your people, when to activate their abilities, managing the ship's modules, and deciding what rolls to reasolve problems with and which to bank for new abilities, this simple RNG becomes quite a fun challenge where the right choices can hold off disaster just long enough to turn everything around---of course the next bad roll may doom you anyway, but it's still fun! Games are quick,too. Maybe 30 to 40 minutes to beat it, with several unlockable characters to keep you coming back. And apaprently new missions are in the works. I watched several youtubers play the game before decding to buy it, and when I found myself talking to the screen, telling the player he should've rolled another character's dice or chose a diffenent ability, it became clear I just needed to try it for myself (I grabbed it with the intro discount, so it was $10, which feels reasonable to a new release of this style). The story is blagh, but that doesn't affect the gameplay. Bottomline, if you enjoy tabletop dice games like Zombie Dice and accept the fact that chance is a factor, this is a fun little time-killer.","January 20","true","14.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

There are dice in this game. They are very important - that is - bad results can topple the best strategies. If that makes your blood boil don't get this game.\n\nIf your dislike of dice is more nuanced  then they are probably ok here. People who are on the fence about dice usually don't like them when they are a fail or succeed mechanism (like D&D), but like them when they give options (like Yahtzee). While there are better and worse rolls here, most rolls can be played in a number of different and (to me) interesting ways.\n\nSo - if you make it past the Dice check you will fall into one of the following three cases:\n\nCase 1) I have played cooperative board games and like them (Pandemic, Ghost Story, Forbidden Island, Flash Point - there are dozens of these).\n\nYou will almost certainly love this. It solidly in that genre, yet with clean original mechanics. It plays fast with a wide variety of situations, and has a lot of skill. For the players that feel it is too hard - it might be, but these games want to be a real accomplishment when you beat them otherwise they tend to be used up once you understand them. There will be games that you can't win - but many of the best solitaire games are that way - and you just try to get the best record you can. (I would be curious what a really good win % is, knowing that can often mitigate the immediate reaction the game is too hard)\n\nCase 2) I have played cooperative board games and don't like them.\n\nThere is still a small chance that you will like this. If you don't like them because you don't like other people arguing with you about the best strategy, and dealing with tons of fiddly bits - you might like this because the computer handles the fiddly bits and doesn't argue with you. If that doesn't describe you then this game will hold no interest for you.\n\nCase 3) Cooperative board game, whAaa?\n\nIf you haven't played a cooperative board game it is hard to predict whether or not you will like this. It is very much a computer board game, this could easily be turned into a non virtual game. It is turned based, has a lot of luck and a lot of skill, and it plays fast. It is probably different than any game you have played before. A brief description of the genre: Bad stuff happens every turn. You deploy your team every turn to put out fires and prevent future disasters as best you can. In this game survive 10 turns in the ♥♥♥♥ storm that is released upon you and you win.","January 20","true","9.2"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Halfway through a meteroid shower critically damages the ship, destroying all your storages and killing two of your crew. Now you have to survive for ten weeks (= turns) until you reach your destination, constantly busy repairing old and new damage, trying to improve your food stock and ship health, and keeping as many as possible alive.\n\nCool? It's a game based on rolling dies, with random events each turn, where all you can do is to manage and deploy your crew to improve your odds as good as possible. You do that by keeping the number of dies available to each crew member as high as possible (requiring food), by keeping them from getting injured and their stress levels low, by fixing up the hull - and by having as many asissts (protection against unfortunate die values) available as possible. Unfortunately all that requires die which you also need to constantly repair the damage poping up all around the ship. And then there's the research tab that allows you to store up to six die and invest them later to repair a module, add asissts or improve health/stress.\n\nManaging this - crew, their abilities, deploying them in the right order and to the most sensible modules, keeping them effective and healthy, and using your dies as efficient as possible - that's the challenge of this game. Yes, it's heavily randomized, and even the best tactics can't save you from disaster if Lady Luck doesn't smile on you, but trying is fun too. As it's only ten turns (each taking about a minute or so) long, you can try often, using different crew compositions (you unlock new crew members by meeting certain challenges) and tactics.\n\nIt's a short, challenging but fun time waster. If you can cope with the randomness, and the above sounds good for you, then give it a try: you'll probably be very positively surprised.","January 19","true","56.1"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

It’s a game about changing them."\n\nEverytime I've failed, I felt like there was something I could have done to change the result, like ignore one broken module completely and instead pump dice into getting food, health, repairs and research to keep the "team" running at best capability. One module can't be damaged twice and that creates the neat effect of balancing what needs fixing, what doesn't and which characters you can avoid repairing with to better prepare for future turns.\n\nTharsis requires understanding your priorities on the most explosive, radiating, malfunctioning ship humanity ever built as well as a healthy dose of planning and managing risks versus the rewards, for some that's going to be boring, or frustating.

Your basic goal is to survive 10 turns of disasters, panic and dice till your team makes it to Mars. However there is a very strange twist to the story as the two of the six crewmembers die in a massive micro-meteor strike. The story only gets stranger the closer you get to mars, giving it that very eerie feel, something which only grows stronger with the ending.\n\nThough the game has a significant element of luck in the dice, it is the epitome of requiring lateral thinking to fixing problems that one faces as well as absolute micromanagement of resources. It is difficult. it is harsh. But it is rewarding. So very rewarding when you plan things right and you can tank through the damage to your ship to land all four crew on mars.\n\nThe art style is a great blend of the old classics such as 2001: A Space Odyssey and the Black Hole, while still making it look all so functional like the more recent Martian movie. It's fun to look at, the music is entrancing and it's the small details from the dice that turn into bloodied messes if your crew have eaten human flesh to the description of the events and systems that just pulls it all together.\n\nIt's small playtime of 20-30 minutes of each run give it a very FTL feel, while the procedural generated nature means you really cannot predict what might happen next turn or if the dice go south. It's interesting, it's fascinating and unique.

I don't think there's anything more that anyone could reasonably expect from Tharsis, ergo it comes with my strong recommendation to anyone who is intrigued by the disaster in space premise, and who is happy to embrace the dice-based approach to keeping the Iktomi spacecraft - and it's crew - intact.\n\nRegarding the infamous difficulty, my play record is 45 attempts, with 10 successful arrivals at Mars. Additionally, I would say that 5-10 of my failures were due to obvious errors on my part, and so overall I don't personally believe my win rate to be unfair or unacceptable... especially when you take into account that the basic scenario of the game would hardly be a simple one to overcome were it to ever happen in real life. There IS a lot of random chance, of course - such is the way when dice are involved - but at the same time there are generally multiple options available to the player at any one time, with many of them allowing him or her to take something from even low numbered rolls... even simply utilising an otherwise useless dice to shake up the reseach choices can reveal an option which, when subsequently taken, helps to get the player on top of their situation.\n\nI've seen others compare Tharsis to FTL, given that they both offer an uncompromising challenge in a cosmic setting. Having played FTL myself, and failing to complete it even once, I can say that title triggered a lot more irritation than Tharsis ever did... for me, the fact that the final battle in FTL is one where the big boss comes back several times, even though it's more than tough enough to just make it that far in the first place and beat one iteration of the last enemy, perfectly encompasses how unfair - and occasionally rage-inducing - that game can feel. To my mind, FTL leaves the player fewer options for making the best of bad luck, and with the absence of dice - i.e. random chance - feels a lot more deliberately, and downright spitefully, difficult for difficulty's sake... as a consequence, it alienated me in a manner that Tharsis never did.\n\nAll that said, I've not tried Tharsis on the hard difficulty setting, and don't have any intention of doing so... normal mode is more than enough of a challenge for me!\n\nI'm not going to claim that I think the game is perfect, however... I do personally believe that some crew members (e.g. the doctor and the mechanic) are a lot more useful than others (although this would quite possibly be the case in the aftermath of any real-life space accident en route to Mars), but then it could also be argued that getting the less helpful astronauts to their destination simply represents another gameplay vector for those who wish to replay the title in order to chase achievements. Plus, for all that I've generally stuck up for the challenge that Tharsis offers, nevertheless even I sometimes feel that the game has it in for the player on some attempts, for instance when it throws several modules with 2-3 damage - and 2-3 injury and/or void dice - at you on consecutive turns, which can be practically impossible to survive even with the most serendipitous of dice rolls. Also, the ending of the game is somewhat 'out there', and perhaps a little unsatisfying overall, although I admit that I liked the playful nod to its entertainment medium (if I've interpreted things correctly, that is).","January 13","true","23.3"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","3","6","2","0"

Judging from the (surprising) number of negative reviews, a lot of people put this game in that category - I don't.\n\nA lot of the reviews make out like it's a case of "roll a 3d6; rolled less than 16? you lose", but it's nearly never like that, and on the rare occasions that it is, it's probably because you made a mistake earlier on.\n\nThis game isn't roulette - it's poker. The draw is random, and occasionally you get a hand so bad that the odds are stacked too heavily against you, but how you play it is really what determines the outcome. (For what it's worth, I have about a 1 in 3 win rate, but some players get significantly higher.)\n\nOnce I'd played the game for a while I thought about leaving a positive review, but wasn't entirely convinced about the value given the cost, which is high for such a simple game. The thing is though, I found this game surprisingly compelling, and keep going back for another go. Now that I'm about ten hours in and likely to pick up a lot more (unless I get seriously sucked into Rise of the Tomb Raider) I've reassessed: it's a definite thumbs-up for any gamer who pays attention to the probabilities in risk-management games and enjoys things like Darkest Dungeon, Nethack, or XCOM, where you don't expect to win every game.","January 28","true","10.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

You have to repair parts of the ship each round to prevent it from blowing up.  But you need to do that with dice, which you might get at the end of each round if you got food and sacrificed something else.  Of course moving from one part of the ship to another may also cause you to get injured and die, and lets not forget that the dice themselves may end up killing you.  No, it kicks the fun out of you, take away 2 or 3 ways to die and give me a shot at finishing the game before unlocking the 'hero' crew that you get for playing over and over and over again.

I've watched streams and played enough to where I have a good feel of how the game works, and it's a lot about balancing risks.  Every turn you ponder for a few minutes, thinking of who to send where, and who can do what.\n\nA typical turn might look like this:\nAlright, I have three things to fix this turn, and two of them will blow up the ship.  My mechanic's at one of them, a broken hatch.  He needs to roll 19 with five dice to fix it, which is doable but tricky.  He'll probably need help.  My doctor's in a room with another event, but he only has two health, and there's a chance of injury here.  If he tries to fix it alone he might die.  I could leave it alone--lose one health on my doctor, run him to the more ship critical SPDA damage in med bay.  If I get lucky I could use the medbay to patch up my doctor as well.  That leaves the captain and pilot with three dice each.  I'll the captain to medbay first, use my accumulated research to give him another die, and send the pilot to help the mechanic.\n\nOnce you have a plan, you begin execution, rolling the dice, adapting the plan to what happens.  Sometimes the dice fall in your favor--the mechanic might get lucky and fix the hatch all by himself--that frees up my pilot to help with the medbay.  Maybe he rolls poorly--I cycle the dice into research, shuffling and hoping for ship hull fixes or a quick repair.  If it doesn't work maybe I use his skill to give me just one more hull point to survive until the next turn.\n\nIf you're into games that require this sort of planning, execution, adaptation, combined with desperation and unflinching difficulty, then this game is for you.  The game will try to blow up your ship and kill your crew at every turn, but through careful planning and estimation of risks, you can overcome those odds, guide your crew through a very narrow path and eventually, survive.  And immediately after succeeding, all you'll want to do is try again.\n\n--\n\nA note on randomness--I've read a lot of reviews about how much luck is involved in the game.  It is true that if you always roll exactly what you need, you'll win, and the game is easy.  Most of the game is not around this however--it's about managing the situation so that it's likely you get what you need, and figuring out how to scramble in the cases you don't.","January 21","true","20.5"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

I think partly because I enjoy boardgames and this plays very much like a solo board game. Graphically it is nothing that special, it looks pretty static, I only learned later on by chance that some parts of the scenery are animated if you click on them. The game play is hard, deliberately so. At first you might be thinking isn't there an easier mode, but part of the enjoyment comes from the fact you will learn strategies that get you a little further each time.\n\nOkay luck plays a big part as well, it is dice based after all, sometimes even you best strategy will fail because of a bad roll, or some damage occurs that you just aren't ready to deal with, but that's part of the fun/frustration as well. Your strategies just help stack the odds in your favour, but sometimes the fates just aren't with you. I've only had the game crash on me once, but I didn't lose any progress, and they are still patching the game at the moment.\n\nWhen you do beat the game there is a real sense of achievement. I'm not sure how much replay value is there once you do manage to get to Mars, so far I've completed it once. This game certainly isn't going to appeal to everyone, but it's clear a lot of thought went into the design and it really captures the themes they were aiming for.

The only two problems I really have are:\n-The lack of contents, but with the price it actually is I won't list it as a negative thing.\n-The ending (spoiler alert: it makes sense, but I think they hid the actually meaning way too deep inside the story to be easily understood).\nIf you don't want to be spoiled, don't read further.\nExplanation about the story:\nSo Tharsis is set in the same universe as Laserlife, a game about a dead astronaut found floating in space by an extremely advanced alien lifeform who doesn't completely exist as a physical being. The dead astronaut is in fact the one who gets ejected into space in the beginning of Tharsis.\nAt the end of Laserlife, the alien understand the hardship and the sacrifices the humans endured, and since Tharsis also feature a metaphysical alien at the end (with one ending ending with the sentence "The anomaly... It knew".), then it means that they are a single entity.\nSo now, it would mean that they tried to make the humans survive no matter what, because that's what humans would do isn't it? Putting them in an infinite loop of suffering, but with the hope of surviving at the end.\nBut since endless suffering isn't something human they chose to destroy the anomaly at the true end, sacrificing themselves but putting an end at that loop.\n(Reminder: Laserlife and Tharsis are game about symbolism whereas Bit trip runner was about Minimalism)\n\nTL; DR: Not so hardcore, just bear it until you get good, need more content and the story should be less hidden.","January 24","true","8.0"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

The crew must scramble each turn to repair rooms and counteract ship damage and other negative events. Each room can provide different bonuses, from food production to ship repair and health increases. Each crew member has a class that determines their special ability, health, stress level (higher stress makes for worse decision choices), and dice supply (replenished with food). Dice are rolled in each repair event, used to simply repair the calamity, activate the crew member’s class ability or room module ability, or undertake research projects for instant benefits. Each repair mission can have hazards that will cause crew damage, locked dice, or lost dice if specific numbers are rolled; hazards can be automatically countered with assists. Tharsis excels in crisis prioritization: there are never enough crew to do everything, and placing the right combination of crew in the right rooms in the right order produces intriguing strategy.

The story only gets stranger the closer you get to mars, giving it that very eerie feel, something which only grows stronger with the ending.\n\nThough the game has a significant element of luck in the dice, it is the epitome of requiring lateral thinking to fixing problems that one faces as well as absolute micromanagement of resources. It is difficult. it is harsh. But it is rewarding. So very rewarding when you plan things right and you can tank through the damage to your ship to land all four crew on mars.\n\nThe art style is a great blend of the old classics such as 2001: A Space Odyssey and the Black Hole, while still making it look all so functional like the more recent Martian movie. It's fun to look at, the music is entrancing and it's the small details from the dice that turn into bloodied messes if your crew have eaten human flesh to the description of the events and systems that just pulls it all together.\n\nIt's small playtime of 20-30 minutes of each run give it a very FTL feel, while the procedural generated nature means you really cannot predict what might happen next turn or if the dice go south. It's interesting, it's fascinating and unique. I highly recommend this game to anyone that loves board games, space and the desperate panic that comes with trying to survive.","January 21","true","9.6"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

I don't think there's anything more that anyone could reasonably expect from Tharsis, ergo it comes with my strong recommendation to anyone who is intrigued by the disaster in space premise, and who is happy to embrace the dice-based approach to keeping the Iktomi spacecraft - and it's crew - intact.\n\nRegarding the infamous difficulty, my play record is 45 attempts, with 10 successful arrivals at Mars. Additionally, I would say that 5-10 of my failures were due to obvious errors on my part, and so overall I don't personally believe my win rate to be unfair or unacceptable... especially when you take into account that the basic scenario of the game would hardly be a simple one to overcome were it to ever happen in real life. There IS a lot of random chance, of course - such is the way when dice are involved - but at the same time there are generally multiple options available to the player at any one time, with many of them allowing him or her to take something from even low numbered rolls... even simply utilising an otherwise useless dice to shake up the reseach choices can reveal an option which, when subsequently taken, helps to get the player on top of their situation.\n\nI've seen others compare Tharsis to FTL, given that they both offer an uncompromising challenge in a cosmic setting. Having played FTL myself, and failing to complete it even once, I can say that title triggered a lot more irritation than Tharsis ever did... for me, the fact that the final battle in FTL is one where the big boss comes back several times, even though it's more than tough enough to just make it that far in the first place and beat one iteration of the last enemy, perfectly encompasses how unfair - and occasionally rage-inducing - that game can feel. To my mind, FTL leaves the player fewer options for making the best of bad luck, and with the absence of dice - i.e. random chance - feels a lot more deliberately, and downright spitefully, difficult for difficulty's sake... as a consequence, it alienated me in a manner that Tharsis never did.\n\nAll that said, I've not tried Tharsis on the hard difficulty setting, and don't have any intention of doing so... normal mode is more than enough of a challenge for me!\n\nI'm not going to claim that I think the game is perfect, however... I do personally believe that some crew members (e.g. the doctor and the mechanic) are a lot more useful than others (although this would quite possibly be the case in the aftermath of any real-life space accident en route to Mars), but then it could also be argued that getting the less helpful astronauts to their destination simply represents another gameplay vector for those who wish to replay the title in order to chase achievements. Plus, for all that I've generally stuck up for the challenge that Tharsis offers, nevertheless even I sometimes feel that the game has it in for the player on some attempts, for instance when it throws several modules with 2-3 damage - and 2-3 injury and/or void dice - at you on consecutive turns, which can be practically impossible to survive even with the most serendipitous of dice rolls. Also, the ending of the game is somewhat 'out there', and perhaps a little unsatisfying overall, although I admit that I liked the playful nod to its entertainment medium (if I've interpreted things correctly, that is).","January 13","true","23.3"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","3","6","2","0"

I've watched streams and played enough to where I have a good feel of how the game works, and it's a lot about balancing risks.  Every turn you ponder for a few minutes, thinking of who to send where, and who can do what.\n\nA typical turn might look like this:\nAlright, I have three things to fix this turn, and two of them will blow up the ship.  My mechanic's at one of them, a broken hatch.  He needs to roll 19 with five dice to fix it, which is doable but tricky.  He'll probably need help.  My doctor's in a room with another event, but he only has two health, and there's a chance of injury here.  If he tries to fix it alone he might die.  I could leave it alone--lose one health on my doctor, run him to the more ship critical SPDA damage in med bay.  If I get lucky I could use the medbay to patch up my doctor as well.  That leaves the captain and pilot with three dice each.  I'll the captain to medbay first, use my accumulated research to give him another die, and send the pilot to help the mechanic.\n\nOnce you have a plan, you begin execution, rolling the dice, adapting the plan to what happens.  Sometimes the dice fall in your favor--the mechanic might get lucky and fix the hatch all by himself--that frees up my pilot to help with the medbay.  Maybe he rolls poorly--I cycle the dice into research, shuffling and hoping for ship hull fixes or a quick repair.  If it doesn't work maybe I use his skill to give me just one more hull point to survive until the next turn.\n\nIf you're into games that require this sort of planning, execution, adaptation, combined with desperation and unflinching difficulty, then this game is for you.  The game will try to blow up your ship and kill your crew at every turn, but through careful planning and estimation of risks, you can overcome those odds, guide your crew through a very narrow path and eventually, survive.  And immediately after succeeding, all you'll want to do is try again.\n\n--\n\nA note on randomness--I've read a lot of reviews about how much luck is involved in the game.  It is true that if you always roll exactly what you need, you'll win, and the game is easy.  Most of the game is not around this however--it's about managing the situation so that it's likely you get what you need, and figuring out how to scramble in the cases you don't.","January 21","true","20.5"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

With the aid of six-sided dice, you manage a crew's abilities, health, and stress, and your spaceship's hull strength, aboard an eerily catastrophic mission in space, and attempt to survive 10 rounds.\n\nThe game suffers from pacing issues and a lack of content. Tharsis attempts to overwhelm the player and is unforgiving in its challenge, just using a brute-force approach to try to bash the player into submission before 10 rounds. While a "mission" mode is promised in the main menu as 'coming soon', the whole of the game is just those ten rounds, encouraging you to replay it to unlock additional characters to use.\n\nIt is, however, quite nicely done with a 3D spaceship and crew, and an amazing amount of detail in the spaceship components. Comic-book style cutscenes of still images and a moving camera pad out the graphical niceness, along with full voice-acting. It's also very simple and easy to understand from a player's perspective, despite the difficulty and depth of choices.\n\nA solid game, though not without its faults. However, a more experienced gamer in tabletop gaming may quickly become  bored with Tharsis' simplicity and reliance on brutality over more elegant dilemmas and strategy. I have no qualms about recommending Tharsis - but I'd also point that Elder Signs: Omen is a much more complex game with more content that is very similar to Tharsis, and as of this writing, $10 on Steam compared to Tharsis' $15.","January 17","true","4.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

You will cry. You will argue. You will become the black hole made of butthurt. Than, you will win and prevail.\n\nActually, there are things that could be made better about the game, and setting aside the balance (if the game is hard on purpose, its not a balance problem, but of attitude) -- things like crew deaths (whice are death sentence except if they happen in last 2 rounds) -- could be made more enjoyable, more appealing for storytelling. I mean, developers definitely try to do that by compensating you with cannibalism perks and stuff, but in 23 games played I have yet to see the situation when it helps enough to survive. Maybe there should be different compensation, i don't know.\nStories like 'and than my guy goes in the room and rolls 3 double injuries, but I found the way to make his charred remains into anti-stress gym equipment' are more funnier than '... and of course i lost the run'.\n\nIn other things, the game is pretty smart, you need to pay attention. For example, you roll 1+2, dices get stasis, you can't reroll and you could waste them making only 3 repairs OR you could use the science and make them into 7-repair spell. Also, you have to plan ahead and split '=' dices in food and repair rooms between guys.\n\nAnyway, buy this only if you are not scared to lose much.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Delphaeus/recommended/323060/","Delphaeus","TOG | Delphaeus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Delphaeus/","381 products in account","TLDR: Very difficult survival management game using dice rolls to determine success/failure. Good game once you get the hang of it, but don't expect to win many games. (so far i've played 9 games and haven't won one yet - record is 3 weeks from mars)\n\nLong version:\nSo you're on a space ship going to mars, and suddenly your ship is falling apart. You have 4 crew members onboard and your ship has an overall "hull strength". Each module of the ship has an ability you can use, and each crew member has an ability you can use. Each round, 2-3 modules on your ship breaks and you need to either repair them or suffer the consequences. At the end of each round you are given a choice between 2-3 options which usually is getting something good and accepting something bad.\n\nSo, what are you managing?\n1. You need to harvest food to keep your crew fed (each time you use a crew member, he loses one dice. One food regains 3 dice)\n2. You need to repair ship modules to keep using their abilities and to prevent their side effects (ie: a broken module can cause damage to hull strength or affect crew health)\n3. You need to increase crew health when possible\n4. You need to decrease crew stress when possible\n5. You need to increase hull strength when possible\n\nThere is only a few downsides to this game at the moment. First is that it isn't well explained in some areas. For example, when you see 3 empty boxes with equal signs between them, it means you need to put up to 3 dice with the same number in the boxes. The boxes will fill up left to right, and the diamonds below the boxes indicate how many of the reward you will recieve for filling that box in.\n\nSecond, I find the "Normal" mode to be very difficult. I'd love an "easy mode" while learning the game, where your crew starts off being fully fed (5 dice) and you get only 2 damage events per "round"\n\n","January 16","true","4.1"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

I will try hard mode now and see if its any different.\n\nHonestly, you just have to be good at math and understand the order in which to do things and what's worth more to you. Obviously there is a component of luck, because yes the starting conditions are random and the sections that get damaged are random too, but its not like I had to restart 5 times to get a good setup, I had a winning setup on my first try.\n\nAs for the game, great graphics, beautiful sounds, really nice gameplay, polished, definitely a finished product.

Tharsis blends an interesting boardgame aesthetic with the tough decision-making and resource-management of the best in turn-based strategy sims. At first it seems as if the dice completely control the experience, but as you spend more time with the game it becomes apparent that the real strategy comes from learning *when* to move, *who* to move, *where* to move and what to repair when you get there, always taking into account that low dice rolls may throw a wrench into your plans. The secret is to plan your turns in such a way that you minimize the severity of low dice rolls, and celebrate the moments when the dice are kind. It's really a one-in-a-kind experience.\n\nAnd that's not to mention the temptation of making use of *all* the possible meals on board as the mission progresses... once you see the possibility of eking one more week of survival by making costly sacrifices, it becomes very difficult to stop...\n\nHighly recommended.","January 12","true","9.9"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

I don't think there's anything more that anyone could reasonably expect from Tharsis, ergo it comes with my strong recommendation to anyone who is intrigued by the disaster in space premise, and who is happy to embrace the dice-based approach to keeping the Iktomi spacecraft - and it's crew - intact.\n\nRegarding the infamous difficulty, my play record is 45 attempts, with 10 successful arrivals at Mars. Additionally, I would say that 5-10 of my failures were due to obvious errors on my part, and so overall I don't personally believe my win rate to be unfair or unacceptable... especially when you take into account that the basic scenario of the game would hardly be a simple one to overcome were it to ever happen in real life. There IS a lot of random chance, of course - such is the way when dice are involved - but at the same time there are generally multiple options available to the player at any one time, with many of them allowing him or her to take something from even low numbered rolls... even simply utilising an otherwise useless dice to shake up the reseach choices can reveal an option which, when subsequently taken, helps to get the player on top of their situation.\n\nI've seen others compare Tharsis to FTL, given that they both offer an uncompromising challenge in a cosmic setting. Having played FTL myself, and failing to complete it even once, I can say that title triggered a lot more irritation than Tharsis ever did... for me, the fact that the final battle in FTL is one where the big boss comes back several times, even though it's more than tough enough to just make it that far in the first place and beat one iteration of the last enemy, perfectly encompasses how unfair - and occasionally rage-inducing - that game can feel. To my mind, FTL leaves the player fewer options for making the best of bad luck, and with the absence of dice - i.e. random chance - feels a lot more deliberately, and downright spitefully, difficult for difficulty's sake... as a consequence, it alienated me in a manner that Tharsis never did.\n\nAll that said, I've not tried Tharsis on the hard difficulty setting, and don't have any intention of doing so... normal mode is more than enough of a challenge for me!\n\nI'm not going to claim that I think the game is perfect, however... I do personally believe that some crew members (e.g. the doctor and the mechanic) are a lot more useful than others (although this would quite possibly be the case in the aftermath of any real-life space accident en route to Mars), but then it could also be argued that getting the less helpful astronauts to their destination simply represents another gameplay vector for those who wish to replay the title in order to chase achievements. Plus, for all that I've generally stuck up for the challenge that Tharsis offers, nevertheless even I sometimes feel that the game has it in for the player on some attempts, for instance when it throws several modules with 2-3 damage - and 2-3 injury and/or void dice - at you on consecutive turns, which can be practically impossible to survive even with the most serendipitous of dice rolls. Also, the ending of the game is somewhat 'out there', and perhaps a little unsatisfying overall, although I admit that I liked the playful nod to its entertainment medium (if I've interpreted things correctly, that is).","January 13","true","23.3"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","3","6","2","0"

Thats the short version of this review. Anything thats dice manipulation is too minimal while the game has no problem throwing impossible odds at you. You are at the mercy of the unchecked RNG to complete a run.\n\nYour 4 Astronauts are aboard the Iktomi, a Space Ship consisting of 7 stations. Each stations has a benefit to either your Astronauts or the Iktomi itself if a Astronaut uses a dice that rolled a 5-6, Doubles/Triples or Free depending on which station you are. If you activate their benefits you can receive 1-2 FOOD, restore sanity to 1 crew, fully restore 1 crew health, repair your ship, etc.\nEvery Week(Turn) new Events(Problems) will pop up, up to 2-3, that will require your Crew to FIX it, if not they will either Damage your ship or your Crew or disable that station functionality at the end of every Week until you fix it. Taking an Astronaut to the event with their available dice at that moment (max 5d6 per Astronauts), reduce to 0 or if you cant reduce it to 0, as much as you can and then take another Astronaut and repeat till it hits 0.\nExample: Event #25 pops up, Take X Crew there with 2d6(2 dices of 6 sides), your results will be around 2-12... so after that astronaut finishes you will need to bring more crew members there to help until you can reduce 25 to 0. Every Astronaut can re-roll Once, except for a Astronaut which ability adds an extra re-roll.\nEverytime you use an Astronaut for an Event or for a Station, they permantly lose 1 die from their pool, this can be refill with FOOD(3d6) icons and the Oxygen Station(2d6) up to a MAX of 5d6.\n\nWhile rolling to REPAIR that #X on the Events, each Event will have some "BAD" results which for every die that lands on a specific number, that Astronaut will suffer a penalty. INJURY: For each die landing on # lose 1 health, VOID: landing on a # you lose that die for that roll and STATIC: lands on a # you cant reroll that die. Assist is a resource thats used AUTOMATICALLY everytime you get hit with a penalty even if you didnt want to....\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=599845225\n\n\nRed Blocks on Events determines the damage on your ship at the end of every turn.\nThat picture pretty sums up the problem with this game, unchecked balance and RNG.\nEach crew member has a passive ability but when the game assaults the ship with 3 Events like shown, 32, 26 and 19, theres no passive in the world that can save you. Especially when you start rolling low and there NOTHING to manipulate the results.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=599907750\n\nAnyone that has played somekind of dice game, knows that d6 can be a wild number and without any way to manipulate results, other than reroll ONCE, knows thats bad game mechanic a reason why new boardgames dont use a dice to move mechanic. Its entirely possible to have a doomed crew on Week 2 which Ive had countless times. The game has 0 mercy, and this is on normal, on assaulting the ship with 3 events of high improbability with major INJURIES to boot.\n\nWorst of all, again, no way to manipulate the dice, either roll high or doubles or dont get any benefit from any station or crew's ability to use, except for the Oxygen Room. which most of this are just minor.\nThe only thing this reminds me off is Yatzhee!! Roll... roll again did you get it? Great.... you didnt then GTFO!\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=599716714\nWhy even choose?\n\nWith so many inspiration out there and boardgames that move outside of this wild RNG, with a RNG Event system that can kill your crew from the get go with no input from you, no dice manipulation mechanics with a game that plays like Craps (Casino) and Yahtzee!!. Its really hard to recommend.\n\nGranted, you will have fun with its aesthetics, music and Yahtzee!! Style of gameplay... and thats what I would say. Throwing X number of dice 2 times and see if you are doomed can be as addicting as Yahtzee!! and just as intriguing.","January 13","false","7.0"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","4","8","0","1"

Actually, "greatly" doesn't state how many times you're going to die in this game.  After a while of playing, you can see, several plays ahead, that you're not going to make it.  For instance, repairing a module that states that if you roll a 2, 3, or 4, your character is going to become injured and eventually killed.  But it has to be repaired, right?  Yeah... good luck with that.  The game is borderline unplayable, as after about two hours of gameplay, you realize there's just no way to win.  The difficulty increase is so random, you can play five rounds or just two before the game goes from "well, that wasn't so bad" to "why am I even trying?"  There are more than a few logic bugs in this game, but fun if you know you're not going to win... ever.  There is great randomness and anyone who says this game "takes skill" is full of it.  Each week will last about 10-15 minutes.  Sure, the game makes you feel like your choices are swaying the game, but the game itself has already determined whether or not you'll even proceed to the next week.  This could be a great game if the developers had a better grasp on logic.  They could add onto the weeks to slowly become more difficult.  The way it is now, it just slams you from "Driving Miss Daisy" to "Kill Bill" in the first two rounds.  After playing for a while, I'm not surprised the price has gone down.

Good game once you get the hang of it, but don't expect to win many games. (so far i've played 9 games and haven't won one yet - record is 3 weeks from mars)\n\nLong version:\nSo you're on a space ship going to mars, and suddenly your ship is falling apart. You have 4 crew members onboard and your ship has an overall "hull strength". Each module of the ship has an ability you can use, and each crew member has an ability you can use. Each round, 2-3 modules on your ship breaks and you need to either repair them or suffer the consequences. At the end of each round you are given a choice between 2-3 options which usually is getting something good and accepting something bad.\n\nSo, what are you managing?\n1. You need to harvest food to keep your crew fed (each time you use a crew member, he loses one dice. One food regains 3 dice)\n2. You need to repair ship modules to keep using their abilities and to prevent their side effects (ie: a broken module can cause damage to hull strength or affect crew health)\n3. You need to increase crew health when possible\n4. You need to decrease crew stress when possible\n5. You need to increase hull strength when possible\n\nThere is only a few downsides to this game at the moment. First is that it isn't well explained in some areas. For example, when you see 3 empty boxes with equal signs between them, it means you need to put up to 3 dice with the same number in the boxes. The boxes will fill up left to right, and the diamonds below the boxes indicate how many of the reward you will recieve for filling that box in.\n\nSecond, I find the "Normal" mode to be very difficult. I'd love an "easy mode" while learning the game, where your crew starts off being fully fed (5 dice) and you get only 2 damage events per "round"\n\n","January 16","true","4.1"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

These hazards consist of dice you cannot reroll (Stasis).  Dice that hurt you if you match he posted number (Injury).  And even dice that vanish from the playing field (Void).  This adds to the amount of strategy you have to consider in the game because not only do you have to get rid of these events (they stack up!), you have to manage in what order, and with which crew member you will tackle them with!\n\nThis game is addictive, frustrating, and is always pushing me to get better at it.

It's unforgiving as all hell and really makes you think about the decisions you need to make for the crew in order to try and survive. I still have yet to beat it but I keep getting closer and closer. I have no doubt that I'll make it pretty soon.\n\nIf you're looking for a challenge, I recommend picking it up.\n\n--------------------\n\nAfter playing the game for about 3 hours I've finally managd to beat it with 3 crew members still alive. I did have to cannibalize one of the crew but still, I made it.\n\nI really liked the game and the challenge in managing all of the events. The story is intriguing but I wish there was more of it. Each game can start to feel a bit stale when the same events keep happening from game to game since in the beginning you tend to restart pretty often.\n\nI know missions aren’t in yet which will likely help but I’m not feeling a strong compulsion to play again just yet. With varying events and more content in general I'm sure this will change. I'll definitely try and unlock the rest of the characters at some point because it will help mix things up a bit.\n\nThat said, I still definitely recommend picking it up if you're a fan of board games.

Judging from the (surprising) number of negative reviews, a lot of people put this game in that category - I don't.\n\nA lot of the reviews make out like it's a case of "roll a 3d6; rolled less than 16? you lose", but it's nearly never like that, and on the rare occasions that it is, it's probably because you made a mistake earlier on.\n\nThis game isn't roulette - it's poker. The draw is random, and occasionally you get a hand so bad that the odds are stacked too heavily against you, but how you play it is really what determines the outcome. (For what it's worth, I have about a 1 in 3 win rate, but some players get significantly higher.)\n\nOnce I'd played the game for a while I thought about leaving a positive review, but wasn't entirely convinced about the value given the cost, which is high for such a simple game. The thing is though, I found this game surprisingly compelling, and keep going back for another go. Now that I'm about ten hours in and likely to pick up a lot more (unless I get seriously sucked into Rise of the Tomb Raider) I've reassessed: it's a definite thumbs-up for any gamer who pays attention to the probabilities in risk-management games and enjoys things like Darkest Dungeon, Nethack, or XCOM, where you don't expect to win every game.","January 28","true","10.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

To elaborate, events will happen in the story regardless of how well you do in a level.\n<spoiler>At an earlier point, my food stores were near full, but the story cutscene still said that we are low on supplies. Then at another point, one of my crew members was just killed, but the cutscene tells me that the crew is trying to reassure me that I'm being paranoid about being a poor leader (maybe I just understood it that way). <end spoiler>\nPerhaps if my actions affected the story more than simply advancing it, then I would recommend this game.\nThen there is the story itself, which ends in a very anti-climactic way.\n<spoiler>This wouldn't be so bad, but you literally see the end coming two cutscenes before the actual ending <end spoilers>.\nStill, I had fun playing the game, and if it made any difference to play it multiple times storywise, I would totally still be playing it. But I was able to finish the game after 3 tries (each attempt lasting around 20 to thirty minutes), and the achievements and extra characters are not really that enticing.\nSo in the end, this game will kick your ♥♥♥, and kick it hard. But the pay off is so small, all that pain and frustration really isn't worth it.","January 16","false","5.2"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

Because in 99 out of a hundred games, you will want to do just that as the RNG, halfway through though frequently much sooner, tells you in no uncertain terms that you no longer have any chance at all of winning. What masochist would keep playing under such circumstances?\n\nObviously the single incentive to keep spending time with this evil little slot machine is the hope that drives any gambler: "Maybe this time!" That's it.\n\nFair enough. But when the main draw of a game is the endless drudgery of trying and failing again and again, at least make it quick and easy to abort and start over instead of forcing us to quit because the escape key doesn't respond except at the end of a round.

You're entirely at the whims of RNG.\nThe initial story is quite interesting and suggests there is atleast some mystery to be solved.\nAnd I did read there are multiple endings to reach - though I don't know the extent of that.\nOn top of that there are plans for future content to be added overtime.\n\nAll of that is good.\nHowever if you have to go through a dozen failed runs. Not because you made a mistake.\nBut because the game just outright decided to mess you up with random events and poor dicerolls?\n\nIt starts off when your characters get their dice given to them. This alone can really mess you up.\nHaving the wrong character with low dice? Forget that first turn.\nThen comes number two, which is the random events. Sometimes you get events that you can essentially ignore because their "damage" is inconsequential (a SYSFAIL on a system you wouldn't use for example).\nOther times you simply get a chain of damage ship, damage crew and lose dice events one after another.\nMaking losing out on any one of them immediately a lost run.\n\nEven if you get past that, then you have the hazard dice. Getting "stasis" dice is probably your best bet, though can lock you down for solving the challenge. Getting two or even three "injury" dice and a single bad roll can outright kill a character. Getting a few void dice can simply make it so you can not resolve an event meaning it stick around and next turn you get two or three MORE events on top.\n\nThe "assist" function seems to work from left to right as the hazard dice are displayed. So say you have one assist, and both a stasis AND an injury dice (in that order). Then the stasis gets assisted and your character will get hit.\nYou can't even plan around it and put the assists on hazards of your choosing.\n\nIf you like RNG? Then this is for you, because if there is one thing Tharsis excels at its putting RNG into its RNG to RNG its RNG.\nI hope you're a follower of RNGeesus, cause you're going to need it with Tharsis.","January 16","false","2.7"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

It felt very different after I gave it some time and thought about it. I realized I didn't need to repair the modules. One module which was very risky to repair and took a single "Ship" each turn, I left. I just let it sit through 6 turns and found other ways to make up for that lost Ship. I was far more strategic this round and managed to get to the end and only lost a single crew member and did not resort to cannibalism. I also made extensive use of the research feature.

I most often just stock up on "Assists" so i have can use her first and more effectively because she can still use all her dice afer the potential horrible first dice throw.\n\nAlso, I try to use my "Captain" character last and also in a compartment with somebody else. Her special ability is that you can use one 5+ result of your dice throw to replenish 1 die to all in the compartment. So i use her last, she throws her dice, uses 1 or 2 to finish fixing the room, and then the last to replenish dice to all the crew.\n\nSure you can also get screwed over hard by the dice, this is a dice game after all and the variance on the D6 is large enough to drive you mad.\n\nBut i still enjoy it because i really looooove dice, i like the statistcs aspect, the "i have 4 dice, the average on 4 dice is 14, i should be able to repair this 12-repair section with this chracter and her one Reroll..." thoughts.

It is an incomplete product that shows promise of a great game, but does not yet deliver. I will update my review if this changes.\n\nTharsis is a dice game, which brings a certain kind of randomness into the game play. Now many games provide dice mitigation and manipulation to stabilize the game play, Tharsis doesn't. Instead it opts for a more poker-like approach where a single roll is not really relevant, your overall strategy is (i.e. you might loose some battles, but you still strife to win the war).\n\nThis would be fine, as long as the challenges were generated in a controlled manner. Unfortunately they are not. The game has no issue with generating "unbeatable" challenges for you, my personally most hated are "sniper" -- 3 orange dice of the same value, meaning it will one-shot pretty much anyone attempting the challenge and "black hole" -- high number with a 4,5,6 void dice.\n\nApart from this, game UI needs some small tweaks and the game overall needs more content for its price (but that is apparently coming).\n\nI do believe that if some of the game mechanics were tweaked and made more transparent, the game would become a great casual time-waster of mine, but right now, I will go back to my board game collection instead.","January 18","false","8.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It's hard, but it's only as hard as you make it.  You've really got to think and consider every move, and maybe you'll get lucky.\n\nI've played through three times, and I've already finished once.  The dice are part of it, but using the dice is the biggest deal.  Don't neglect research, assists = life, and see if you can free up a crewmember to get some food.  Consider the chances, and realize that the odds are neither in your favor nor against you, they just are.  Don't expect to roll all sixes, but if you're smart, every dice will be useful.\n\nThe beauty of this game is the fact that it makes you think about what you're going to do and have a plan.  And then have another three plans behind that, if the first one fails.  If you play like that, you've got a better chance.  Everything is a resource, a trade-off.  If you've got four dice, statistics would say that you've got an even chance of fixing 14 repair.  If it's above that number, expect to have two crew work it.  Beef up the ship if you can't make the full fix, and get it next turn.  Use the resources you have to cover those you don't.\n\nThis is a thinking game, and one that will still tell you no, even if you come up with the best plan.  But, if you take your time, consider, question, and try, you'll make it happen.  I think it's an excellent game, and one that I will go back and play again, and die many times in the process.","January 16","true","8.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It is an incomplete product that shows promise of a great game, but does not yet deliver. I will update my review if this changes.\n\nTharsis is a dice game, which brings a certain kind of randomness into the game play. Now many games provide dice mitigation and manipulation to stabilize the game play, Tharsis doesn't. Instead it opts for a more poker-like approach where a single roll is not really relevant, your overall strategy is (i.e. you might loose some battles, but you still strife to win the war).\n\nThis would be fine, as long as the challenges were generated in a controlled manner. Unfortunately they are not. The game has no issue with generating "unbeatable" challenges for you, my personally most hated are "sniper" -- 3 orange dice of the same value, meaning it will one-shot pretty much anyone attempting the challenge and "black hole" -- high number with a 4,5,6 void dice.\n\nApart from this, game UI needs some small tweaks and the game overall needs more content for its price (but that is apparently coming).\n\nI do believe that if some of the game mechanics were tweaked and made more transparent, the game would become a great casual time-waster of mine, but right now, I will go back to my board game collection instead.","January 18","false","8.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Most rouge likes are random and frustrating because it seems like wether you put 10 seconds or 10 minutes into a decsion it doesn't matter; Tharsis rewards players for thinking out all decsions, you can play it safe or take a risk and the game changes drasticlly depending on how safe you wanna play it. Each time I play it is a new hell of dying crew and a ship that is falling apart, making it so each new game I don't just have the same strategy over and over again. The music amazing and sets a theme for the game, and this the only game where I actually feel remorse over letting my crew die or cannabilizing their corpses, the crew's animations change as more bad things happen around them, and actually seeing them start to lose it really connects you to the crew. All in all it is a game the lets new players have fun diying, and allows good players to be good and feel good about mastering the game.

I found it to be a very interesting game, because of how the dice rolls are used in the ship's systems. Sadly, I find that the outcome of the game almost ENTIRELY depends on the rolls that you get. There is a certain amount of strategy in regards to what you can let roll over to the next turn, who will need to take a few damage/lose dice, and which systems to use. Some rolls would perfectly fix a module in one attempt. Others would instantly kill that crew member. This is nothing short of infuriating when you consider how difficult the game is.\n\nRNG aside, I enjoyed the design of the game's systems, the overall aestehtic, and the way the game keeps the common story of a mission to Mars fresh.\n\nThe game also has a great artstyle and an amazing soundtrack.\n\nIf you can enjoy the game even though the dice will attempt to ruin you at every moment, you should play it.","January 12","true","1.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The game makes you feel like all of your decisions are important and impactful, and you usually have multiple options available to you at any point.  Strategic planning and risk management feel important, and there are enough ways to mitigate RNG that it doesn't feel too random.\n- Each run takes about an hour, so it's great to play casually.  You can have a satisfying game in a short time.  You feel accomplished when you've beaten everything the game throws at you.\n- Great art direction.  The ship feels both retro and vaguely plausible near-future tech at the same time.  The music is pretty good and reminds me of Radiohead in places.  There's a real sense of desperation in the storytelling and tone of the game.\n- Could be fun to play with friends?  I could definitely see having a laugh at tabletop night with this.\n\nCons:\n- Only one main scenario/objective in the game currently.  The core gameplay is very fun and well designed, but the amount of variety might be too limited for some players.  The abilities on some crew aren't super exciting to use from a decision-making standpoint.\n- The conclusion to the story is open-ended and some players may dislike this.\n- The level of challenge is very high.  Even playing optimally, you might not win every time.  I feel like this adds an enjoyable amount of tension to the game, but players that dislike a good challenge or hate losing will disagree.\n\nI think the value equation of this game is good.  You're probably playing for at least 10 hours to unlock the majority of the crew, and the game costs about the same as other survival-based board games I've purchased.\n\nPeople are complaining about RNG, but YOU control where your crew deploy, what level of risk you assume, and where you invest your dice.  Think about the odds before you do something.  The game gives you many tools to manage risk and plan strategically, but you need to use those tools.\n\nThe level of luck in this game is similar to Poker.  There is some luck involved, but it's mostly a skill-based game, and it is possible to win consistently using the same strategies.

My main complaint is that even after 10 games each playthrough still feels too similar. Nothing different enough happens to change your playstyle. So I feel as though I'm left trying the same things over and over again hoping that the dice eventually roll more favorably. Since you can't really 'bank' enough alternative options you're often left at the mercy of random chance. I love what the game is trying to do with the dice but it needs a bit more tweaking to give the player a little more agency in how things playout.\n\nThere are some unlockable crew memebrs that might mix things up a bit but I haven't gotten anywhere near unlocking them. So another 4-6 hours of playing might give me the chance to play with those characters.\n\nIt's a well made game so I still give it a positive review, but I have mixed feelings, so read more reviews to see if it's really the kind of game that would bring you fun.","January 17","true","6.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

You could "risk manage" the best you can, and then... four 20s, all of which do 2 damage to your ship, plus whatever niggles (Usually system failures) you've left behind. Shame, because it's pretty... But whats under the hood was put together seemingly without sufficient consideration for how everything *interacts*. A good example would be how rarely you actually get to *use* your research and abilities, because... Well, that crisis is going to keep going until you get rid of it, and more crises are on the way, and at least one of the crises, during a run, is nigh guaranteed to only be solvable *if* you can not only get all your crew to where it is, but also if they roll high, and high rolls aren't considered a bad thing, and -\n\nAnd, and, and, and... Or more accurately "But, but, but, but-" is pretty much the story. You would have gotten past week three this run, if 2s hadn't been a void...

But the doctor rolled nothing higher than a 3 this turn...\n\nThat's 90% of Tharsis runthroughs in a nutshell. You can generally see you're going to lose early, but that, in turn, leads to restarts after only a minute or two of play, and...

The premise is highy inviting, especially for those of us who are board gamers first. When playing a single player game, a person should have more control over the outcome of their session. From the very start of every run, you are completely at the whim of the random event engine. If you half your ship suffers from food blight, then you'll possibly be able to seal your crew into the engine room and coast until you hit Mars; otherwise, you're eventually going to come to a point where a winning scenario is mathematically impossible. And it's not because of anything you did, it's just the random nature of the game.\n\nIf this were the Kobayashi Maru, this review would be different but that's not what this is being billed as. Here's my suggestion; go onto your roof and balance a board out over the edge. weight down the end on the roof with approximately 30 medium-sized sleeping cats. Now go out onto the edge of the board and play yahtzee. Maybe enough of the cats will stay napping on the board that you won't fall off or maybe they'll bugger off tipping you into the abyss. Either way, it wasn't anything you did which kept those cats either staying put or scattering like an exploding hornet nest, so you can't be mad at it. However, you can be disappointed.\n\nIf this scenario sounds like an interesting way to spend an afternoon, then by all means, buy this game. If this scenario sounds like madness, maybe you should think twice about buying this game.","January 18","false","12.6"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","38","3","8","2","0"

Hey, guys.\n\nIf you have any doubts about this game because of the raging fearmongers who tell you it's impossible and that its RNG is broken, bla bla bla...\n\nPlease, look at my profile. Look at my Achievz for this game:\n\nGot to Mars\nMost of Crew Intact (Captain went down with the ship)\nDidn't Eat Anyone\nIN 3.2 HOURS\n\nLet me explain exactly what's going on here.\n\nTharsis has a VERY steep learning curve at the beginning. You're scrambling to put out 800 fires at once, and you only have enough energy to put out... 2 of them. The game forces you to squash immediate threats to your survival while you scramble to create even the slightest semblance of long-term stability. It also forces you to be verrrrry meticulous about the placement of crew, the use of modules (different locations aboard the ship), and the distribution of dice.\n\nAs the developers explained in one of their videos, you shouldn't be fooled by the apparent arbitrary nature of the dice... No, you don't get to choose what numbers come up, but you DO get to choose how to apply them, and that makes ALL the difference in the world. If you're using the right character in the right ship module, or choosing the right research option, what may look like a handful of lousy rolls can easily be turned around into game-changing effects that're even more powerful than straight rolling against the target numbers of various emergency tasks that you have to deal with. Examples:\n\n* If you're in the Maintenance Bay, a pair of snake eyes can counter crippling damage elsewhere on the ship while someone else is whittling away at those repairs.\n\n*If you're in the Laboratory, you can reset the ship's Assist which blocks hazardous dice rolls, protecting the rest of your crew from lethal injuries while they work elsewhere on the ship.\n\nYES, YOU WILL FAIL! MULTIPLE TIMES! Don't be discouraged. I think my first 3 playthroughs lasted a combined total of about 15 minutes... When you still don't know what you're doing, getting smoked takes minimal effort and it happens in the blink of an eye. It may be 5 games, 10 games, before your experience starts to feel more like progress and less like surprise buttsekz, but the good news is that those first few rounds will probably fly by too quickly for you to dwell on them. And slowly, steadily, you'll get further and further along on your voyage.\n\nAll of your crew members have unique abilities, and there are different ways to play with each of them, and other unique crew that unlock after various achievements... and then the sheer randomness of the game itself, as well as a higher difficulty, all add up to a fair amount of replayability for the truly masochistic. Apparently they also have additional "Missions" of an undisclosed nature coming down the pipe as well, so there'll be more places to fly to in the future. For now, getting to Mars is scary enough on its own.\n\nIf you don't own Tharsis yet, I'd offer the same caveat as some other folks have..... This game is not for everyone. On a scale of 1 to Completely-Dank, you probably need to be at least a 7 to be successful here. If you went to one of those schools where everyone got a gold star just for showing up, you probably won't have the temperament that's required for a mission to Mars.\n\nIf you already own the game and don't like what it's doing to your self-esteem, my advice would be to really experiment with your crew and with the various modules aboard the ship, as well as research options, rather than just trying to grind away at one emergency after the next. You'll get a better feel of what you're truly capable of, and you'll see a lot more depth to the game than if you just keep throwing bodies at each new problem as it arises. With luck and practice, you'll probably even survive.\n\nMy only complaint right now is with how short the game is... If and when you do figure it out, 10 turns go by really quickly. I'm hoping that the higher difficulty and the upcoming missions stretch that out a bit.\n\n8/10\n\nUPDATE: The Stress mechanic adds a lot to the game's replayability, and takes most of the sting out of losing when ♥♥♥♥ hits the fan by adding a dash of humor. Your crew start to make hilariously incredibad life choices once they go over the edge, complete with colorful commentary.","January 19","true","11.0"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

Sure, you can just give up early before you roll and do that, but while you are in the process of rolling, you're stuck and forced to watch the same old "Oh, you blew up again!  Look at it go.. in a slow moving fashion while all you can do is furiously hit the space bar to skip this and restart."  I often found myself just quitting out of the game, and now I'm just deleting it from my library.\n\nYeah, I'm salty from playing it for 3 hours straight, all with different techniques that didn't work, but it's no longer fun anymore.  I get it, luck based, yes, I get it.  I understand it, but when there's nothing you can do even when you're doing your best, I just give up.  This game isn't for me, but who knows, it might be for you.  Definitely not me though.","April 1","false","4.5"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","2"

Bad execution.\nIf this were a real board game, it would be broken.\n\nWatch the designers' videos. It's interesting that the lead designer goes on ad nauseum about his design inspirations, because he succeeded in ship design, and failed horribly in character design. I find it painful to watch the character animations. (Also, the music is absolute torture.)\nIn the systems designer's video, he references King of Tokyo and Craps (of all things) as justification for the use of actual dice in this simulated board game. Great, dude; so why didn't you bother to study more appropriate game models when working out your mechanics? Games such as Elder SIgn, Alea Iacta Est, Yspahan, Arkham Horror, or Pandemic?\n\nHere's the thing with a game like this: There has to be some inkling of hope for success. It is definitely important to keep this kind of game challenging, but this game in particular suffers from balance issues (which is a shame - read on).\nIn bg design, we have an ongoing debate about the win:loss ratio of this kind of game, and its effect on replayability. On average, the consensus among designers is that the players should win one in five to ten plays in order to avoid frustration and want to ever again take the box off the shelf.\nThis game sets you up to fail regardless of any concern for your experience beyond the mere process of playing. It's not challenging; it's rigged.\n\nI've played ten times now, and from the very first turn of every game, I  never  had any hope that I would succeed. I'll probably sit down one more night and play through another ten times, just to get a better idea of the trends, but here's where I think the design is fundamentally flawed: Initial setup and escalation curve.\nThe odds are too steep coming out of the gate, and there are never adequate opportunities to prepare for the next challenge(s). I understand the need to keep the pressure on the player, so I don't lament the lack of opportunity to get ahead or on top of the progression, but the most consistent experience I have at the beginning of every round of Tharsis is that there's no point to try to continue the game. It is obviously hopeless at every turn. This is a critical failure in the area of balancing.\n\nDesigners, you have to let the players have some hope! In all but one of my playthroughs, I looked at the (obviously random and arbitrary) dice allocations at the start of game, and felt there was no point to even beginning the game. Did you even playtest this thing, or did you just write some automated script to crunch the numbers? You clearly put a lot of thought into the process, but failed to adequately consider the experience. (A common failing among bg designers.)\n\nUltimately, I think the  concept  of Tharsis is delightful, and the  process  of Tharsis is fun - I really enjoy the dice allocation mechanic, the hard decisions, and the thematic challenges.\nBut the game is broken in setup and balance: FIx that, and Tharss would be an excellent game.","January 17","false","19.6"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

There's the initial aesthetic of playing a challenging game with a learning curve that takes some getting used to. It reminded me a little bit of Dark Souls in that respect. But unlike Dark Souls, there's no chance for improvement. In fact, it is only chance that dictates how well you will do in this game. I played maybe 10 games and while that might not seem like much, it was enough to tell me that I would not enjoy the game. There was no light at the end of the tunnel. Apparently, the game acts like somewhat of a god that will pity you at some point and allow you to win easily, but there is little payoff, at least for now. The Missions option that isn't finished yet could breathe some life into the game, but I doubt it.

But it needs a lot of balancing before it gets there. Randomised dice rolls that you have to prioritise and manage make for a very interesting game and very fun. The character perks add a decent amount of customisation to the game as well. Story is engaging, and the visuals are pretty good for a relativley simple setup.\n\nHowever, the random 'encounters' if you will, realy need to be tweaked. Having 3 events that remove 2 health each and require 20+ points to address is an instant restart. Or else watch your crewmen die in 1, maybe 2 turns.\n\nThis game is fun enough to play, just dont expect any real progression until it has been balanced a lot more.\nAlso- cut scenes are not skipable with the mouse.

Each event has a repair rating (I've seen as low as 7, but most are in the teens, some in the 20's) and if not repaired by the end of the turn each event will damage the ship or crew.\n\nWhile an event is active, there may be effects on certain die rolls. Stasis freezes a die so it can't be rerolled, Injury does a point to the crew member and Void destroys the dice so they can't be used. For instance, if Stasis (1) and Injury (3) are listed, then any ones can't be rerolled and every three that is rolled causes a point of damage to the crew.\n\nYou stop the event by sending crew to the module, rolling their dice and spending them. If you put enough points into the repair to match it's rating then the event is repaired. Repairs carry over, so even partial repairs can help.\n\nAlso, each module has an ability that can be activated by using on or more dice (growing food, healing, reducing stress, etc).\n\nIt all sounds very cool. Sounds like there's lots of potential, but implementation is awful.\n\nYou have a limited number of "Assists". Assists allow you to ignore Stasis, Injury and Void results. Here's the thing though, they are AUTOMATICALLY used. No decision making involved.  Even if you're fine with a die (or dice) locked by Stasis the Assist(s) get used.  Instead of giving you a limited resource you can use at the best moment, you get a limited resource that's automatically used - so much for tactical decision making.\n\nThe totals needed for repairs are over the top compared to the total number of dice you can expect to roll.\nThe fifth turn (halfway point) added three events that required 64 repair (26,24,14) and would do 7 damage (2,2,3) to the ship which had 2 hull left. I still had 2 events going on - a 13 that caused -1 food, and a 12 that was -1 die to all crew.\n\nSurviving that situation isn't so much a matter of skill as luck.\n\n\ncanaithlydian's summary in their review was so spot on I'm just going to copy it here.\n\n"This game would be tense, exciting, and FUN when the damage was just out of reach, where keeping the ship "ok" felt like an accomplishment and seeing what new events came on you made for another exciting round. As it is now, the damage pours on you like a 4 year old pouring syrup on pancakes. The balance, therefore, is immature. HA!\n\nThe developers are really onto something, but they aren't finished. In my view, the balancing has to be tweaked, or this thing becomes a great idea that did not materialize."\n\nI'm a little less convinced that some simple balancing will make it "great" and not just "good" or "ok". It would  still be somewhat bland with the focus being much more about the highest totals rolled and very little focus on pairs/triples.\n","January 16","false","2.4"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

There were some very good and some very bad choices made in the development of this game, and most of them seem to have been conscious design decisions. So far I'm enjoying it, but I cannot recommend it overall. If you saw a youtuber or streamer play this and then actively chose to come to this page, you're probably already in the target audience. If you've played the board game Red November, this is kind of single-player that, except full of despair.\n\nI'm going to start with the intentional reasons you may not enjoy this, because they are dealbreakers if these are not your thing. If they are your thing, consider these to be pros.\n\n-Tharsis is not necessarily a fair game. You will lose early and often, and a few of these losses will be entirely out of your control. My very first game was a loss on the first turn because of some bad dice rolls. That particular situation hasn't come up again, but it is always a possibility.\n\n-Tharsis is /NOT/ a fair game, and it is not forgiving of mistakes. Most turns are a struggle to survive, and any given turn can negate all of your progress. Certain events can hurt your crew members if you roll a certain number. You will roll that number three times in one go and oneshot your doctor. Between each turn you get a choice between various "side projects" for the crew, which usually have a positive effect and a negative effect. There is very little more frustrating then struggling to keep your ship's health ahead of the incoming damage, only to have both options have a negative effect of losing two ship health in return for positive effects that are not useful in the moment.\n\n-To be absolutely clear, Tharsis is not a fair or straightforward game. The basic mechanic for success relies on dice, and plays out much like a euro-style worker placement boardgame. There are certain actions called research projects that can help you overcome insurmountable events, but you only have access to a random group of three at any given time, assuming you have the available dice to use them. There is skill in leveraging your odds and order of actions, but ultimately you are just rigging the game as best as you can and then hoping for the best.\n\n-There is more depth and strategy than will be apparent on your first couple playthroughs, but the game is not going to give you any hints to that. The ingame tutorial, and the video tutorial, are insufficient as to letting you know what the hell you're supposed to do.\n\nThings you might like about Tharsis:\n\n-Game mechanics perfectly convey the atmosphere. You are controlling a crew in a near hopeless situation, and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ does every new event make you feel that. I'd almost rather label this as a playable parable, rather than a game. You aren't maintaining your ship through a rough patch, you're fighting to pull your crew out of the jaws of hell.\n\n-Every turn past the first feels like a victory. This comes with the territory of unforgiving games, but when your decisions pay off and you come out ahead it's immensely satisfying.\n\n-The strategy is there, even if the game doesn't tell really you that. Once you pick up the mechanics you can plan your actions to make the most of what you have, as long as your willing to let those plans change as disaster strikes every turn.\n\nThere are a few genuine design issues that could use fixing.\n\n-Once a die is assigned for repairs, research, a module action, or a crew ability,  you can't undo it. From a game perspective it's irritating because this is a strategy game, not an action game, and I would prefer to have a "Confirm" option after all my actions are assigned. As it stands, your actions autoconfirm, and then you need to confirm that you're sticking with the actions you can't change anyways at the end of each crew member's deployment. Storywise, it feels a little weird since in-game each turn takes place over the course of a week. A few times I've dragged a 6 to the research bar when I mean to drag a 5, leaving me unable to effectively repair the event that's about to destroy the ship. In game terms, my captain fixed a snack instead of putting out the fire in the greenhouse.\n\n-Sometimes you will know full well there's nothing you can do to salvage your game. A crew member will die, or your last critical roll with fail, and you know that within a turn or two it's game over regardless of further action. When that happens, you'll need to wait for all the events to resolve, then wait for a cutscene to load so that you can skip it, then wait through the side project phase, and wait for all the new events of the next turn to be determined, and then you pull up the options and quit to menu to start a new game. Low iteration cycles are important for difficult games to be just difficult, and not frustrating, so an option to start a new game directly at any point would be a great quality of life change.\n\n-About those cutscenes. Yes, they are skippable, but they happen between every turn, and they are static. It takes a couple seconds before you can skip them, and you will be skipping at least the first few after a game or two. Their static nature also pulls a little bit of the "despair" factor out of it. If you make a bad decision on turn two and fail to fix the "Minus One Health To All Crew" event, and your doctor fails to heal your one-health specialist, whose dice were critical to fixing the engine fire and could not be spared to spend the turn in the med bay, then in the next cutscene the captain will still be pleasantly surprised at how well the crew is pulling together and how there might still be a chance for everyone to survive.\n\nThat's Tharsis. It's by no means unwinnable, but you'll need everything you've got to pry victory from the jaws of defeat, and sometimes everything you've got isn't enough.","January 22","false","5.8"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","25","1","4","0","1"

In fact Tharsis is fun to play, for the first hour or two. However it leaves you with a feeling of frustration and contempt, after about 7 or 8 playthroughs. I dont mind the RNG and the randomness that comes from it at times, but I would like that randomness to play into the players favor once in awhile. For instance mabye not have everything break the very next turn after the player just repaired that section. Mabye provide ship up keep for sectors, allowing for the players to be proactive not always struggling. All in all, Tharsis has potential for a great game, however without some changes for alot of gamers who dont have the time to study stradegy on youtube vids and on the forums, how bout just making it easier for the common gamer. I know, the fanboys out there hate when people ask for it to be easier, I just think it would appeal to a much broader audiance. In closing if you want to be challanged to the point of frustration and anger, then by all means Tharsis is for you. When I bought the game I thought people complaining just had short attiention spans, and could'nt be bothered to figure it out. However, now I realize how true the  reviews were and hope other make smart choices. As of right now if I had to rate Tharsis on a scale of  1-10, it would come in at a 3.5 unfortunetly, or at least till the devs start listening to all the gamers and not just the fanboys and make the nessisary changes to make Tharsis the 7.5 or better game I feel it could be one day.\n\n\nP.S I don't do reviews hardly at all, I mabye have done three ever in 8 years.

If you're remotely sane, however, stay away.  The game has some cool flavor, vaguely reminscent of The Martian, but the gameplay fails to live up to that expectation.  There's no more strategy than can be employed in craps or yahtzee.  The game designers presumably said "Hey, roguelikes are popular.  Those are those games where the random number generator kills you over and over again, right?"  It's possible that there's some hidden depth to this that I haven't found, but it seems unlikely.

Tharsis, unfortunately, is as shoddy as the spaceship the unfortunate crew has to repair. Graphics, for example, is nothing to write home about - but judging from the framerate, it strained my GPU like Witcher 2 in high details would. Stability is something you could expect from an early beta. Subtitles in cutscenes between the missions are out of sync with the narrator's speech.

I origianally had my doubts due to the number of negative reviews of the game and their statements are valid to a certain extent. The game is heavily lucked based but you already knew that by the description of the game. It's a dice based game. You expect luck to be a huge factor. However, those luck issues can generally be negated by strategizing when and where to properly re-roll and the like. I won on my first try and therefore, I am led to doubt these people that say they haven't been able to win over more than 10 tries. While that my be true and I just got extremely lucky i have no clue.\n\nAll this aside. I highly recomend this game for those who enjoy games based on luck mixed with strategy (I.E. Risk, FTL). The music is great. The concept is great. The only downside is that the game is extremely short. That may change in future updates with missions and all but at the moment the game is already great.","January 18","true","2.2"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

Yes, you could go into it with a strategy.  Sure, you could play this over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over again and never beat it.  But you know what, even when you're doing really well, the ship's doing well, your crew is healthy, and you're doing the best you've ever done and suddenly your crew just says "Screw it, let's roll just 1's".. it makes me just give up wanting to even try playing this game anymore.  Yeah, there's luck in this game that you need to continue on, but after you get beated down so many times it's hard to even want to bother anymore.\n\nI'd say the worst part about this game is that you KNOW you've lost, there's nothing you can do after you rolled the dice and failed miserably, but there's no way to just his Esc and start over again right away while you are in one of the compartments of the space station.  You have to sit there and wait for the whole process of the ship being ripped up before you can reboot it.  Sure, you can just give up early before you roll and do that, but while you are in the process of rolling, you're stuck and forced to watch the same old "Oh, you blew up again!  Look at it go.. in a slow moving fashion while all you can do is furiously hit the space bar to skip this and restart."  I often found myself just quitting out of the game, and now I'm just deleting it from my library.\n\nYeah, I'm salty from playing it for 3 hours straight, all with different techniques that didn't work, but it's no longer fun anymore.  I get it, luck based, yes, I get it.  I understand it, but when there's nothing you can do even when you're doing your best, I just give up.

It can be an ideal small-game to play on the train or when you're a bit tired and don't feel like playing something larger. The music rules.\n\n--\n\nI am a board gamer (dice count) and this is the first video game that really gives me the kind of joy that I get from my board games.\n\nThis game nails dice rolling and that press-your-luck gameplay.\n\nThis game is procedural, it's not rogue-like as others have suggested. Rogue-likes (using the common definition) offer a variety of gameplay by altering traits during each play.\n\nWhere Dungeon of the Endless provides different technology upgrades and FTL provides different story moments; Tharsis provides random damage to random ship modules. The way it's executed certainly works. If you have to feed 23 die pips into repair and you're rolling 5 dice with an expected value of 17.5 with 2 re-rolls available it feels very possible. But, when a die with a roll of 3, 4, or 6 instantly disappears; it's time for a new tactic.\n\nI enjoy unlocking more crew members, that gave me something to strive for.\n\nThis game is very good. If they find a way to vary the playthroughs a bit more than "sometimes a lot of really hard to beat damage will occur" and "sometimes not so hard damage occurs" then it could be great.\n\nAt least for table gaming enthusiasts who don't mind fighting a losing battle; this should be on your list.","January 13","true","3.7"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Every run has the same exact story, in the same exact order, at the same exact times. Expect to skip many of the cutscenes once you watch them the first time.\n\nIt's a very simple game: roll dice and hope to not get RNG'ed to death. But each character has a specific ability that you can use, and each module has another specific ability that you can use. Yes, you may get RNG'ed to death, BUT you still have to use each character to the best of their abilities, and synchronizing abilities with the order you use the characters adds a bit of strategy to the game.\n\nThis game is reminiscent of gambling in how you play it, so in my opinion replayability is pretty high. No, you don't have anywhere near a good chance at beating the game, but an entire game can take about 15-20 minutes depending on how long you spend making decisions and how far you get. It's a great time killer if you need a short diversion, and if you need to there is a sort of save feature so that you can quit out and continue later.\n\nI would recommend this game to people that enjoy board games or if you need a short game to play between activities. Personally, I really like this game and hope that the developers release more content for it, especially story-wise. This game is NOT for strictly-strategy oriented gamers or people looking for a story, as there is a greater emphasis on the RNG aspect of the game rather than the strategy and the story can be summed up in a few sentences. Also, there are no actual upgrades either in a run or with unlocks, but there are some unlockable characters that you can use in place of the original four. I'm not absolutely sure about this last bit, but I think that the voice actor also changes depending on which characters you choose, though the story doesn't change.\n\nIf the developers add in more story this game could definitely turn into one of my favorite games because I like the gameplay and how quickly the runs end (mostly in a flaming ball of failure, but hey that's how my FTL runs work too).\n\nA few extra issues I have with the game:\n-The skip cutscene button is space instead of the mouse button or any key, which is slightly annoying in a game which only uses the mouse other than skipping cutscenes\n-No option to turn off the hints, and they return every run\n-The unlock requirements are a bit ridiculous, as I have beaten the game and it will probably take me another hour or more of gameplay to unlock even one more character\n-No option to undo any dice allocations (Chess rules: move is not set until you take your hand off the mouse button)\n-What the heck does stress do?

It has everything that I normally enjoy with a simple turn based game and I could totaly see myself making a board game variant to play around a table at home with friends(it has a simalar feel to games like pandemic) as this is essentially a board game.  The problem is that your ability to win or lose is essentially random, there is almost nothing you can do to prevent your death if its coming.  The reason for this is the game is random, and by random I mean everything(with one important exception) is random and therefore there is nothing that you can do to get on a firm ground.  Take FTL for example of how this is done right.  Nearly everything you encounter in that game has a counter be it diplomacy, having the right crew member, or just jumping away.  Sure you can get in a hopeless situation, but often it is of your own making.  In Tharsis you can be on top of the world one turn before only to end the next watching the ship fall apart due to situations you had no way to counter.  There is no "risk reward" mechanic that FTL and Pandemic give you, there is only the hard random rolls of the computer in deciding if you are going to be allowed to advance or not.  Its sad because it feels like this game is almost there but is missing a component to allow you some agency in the game, but alas it falls short by inches (just like nearly everyone playing this game will in reaching mars).","January 21","false","4.9"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

(it's not called easy mode because there are only two modes..  hard and harder).\n\nIf Steam would upgrade the YES/NO approve choice and allow me to select no for competitive, fun, challenging sport of a game, but yes for fancy graphics of rolling dice, I would have given it a yes for fancy rolling graphics, and a NO for story line, because you are not going to see the end of the story, unless you consider any explosion the end..  you'll see plenty of those, so just try not to hurt the poor asteroids.\n\n\nSPOILER:\nAfter browsing thru steam for a game that was actually worth buying..  I noticed a "sister game" by the same devs..  ** I didn't buy it because I noticed immediately it was by the same devs **\n\n[WARNING] HERE COMES THE REAL SPOILER...  the end of one of the videos describing "Laserlife" on steam has the dev speaking in the background by saying "you cannot discover the answers to the questions by playing the one game alone" and the overlayed photo of the "THARSIS" ship is quickly faded in and out..  see the video if you care to know the question.","January 21","false","1.8"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

Im mainly glad this was a gift so i didnt lose out on it. The thing about this game is that i figured it was just a steep learning curve, I anticipated a difficult experience, but i expected a fair one! Im no master of strategy but i have a decent grasp on turn based strategy, ive played them all my life and love them because they rely heavily on the capability of the player, this game however, does not. This game is a crap shoot if ive ever seen one. Imagine hat you're playing dungeons and dragons, and you attempt to intimidate an orc to hand over his goods being the chaotic evil troll you are, you roll a one and instead he asks you for your things, he lands an instant 20. after a few rolls your DM takes out a 12 sided die instead of a D20, he says that you are only able to role a 12 of out 20 and he isnt adjusting accordingly. soon enough all you have is your boxers and a twig you found on the ground and the orc walks out with all of your ♥♥♥♥, thats this game except you can eat your friends and its in space.","February 14","false","4.7"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

My ship fell apart shortly after the tutorial (due to some impossible demands like throwing 22 in a room with 4 5 6 void), but after that I was able to beat the game on my second or third attempt. The journey to Mars seems too short for the money and to be honest I was expecting to get to the next part of the game once I got there, but apparently all you can do after that is play again and again to unlock more characters.\nThe game has a cool concept and even perhaps potential if it was early access, but as it is sold as a finished product unfortunately I would not recommend it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/AegisKay/recommended/323060/","AegisKay","Aegis Kay","http://steamcommunity.com/id/AegisKay/","224 products in account","Its a good looking, easy to learn survival game with a strong theme. But that's all it has. You can be 5 days in, no situations, good food supply, high health, low stress and a well maintained ship. Day 6 starts with 3 situations, more damage potential than your ship has hit points and events which require 6 research points to prevent your crew dying on basic rolls.\n\nThis wouldn't be too bad, but there is a lot of this before you unlock any additional characters. So you grind and grind to unlock things that let you grind more. There is no real sense of accomplishment in this process either. Most turns you either got there because you had dice to spare or you lucked out. In other roguelikes, particularly the similar space themed FTL, it gives you an unlock for even getting half way through a campaign. Not here. You have to stick with the grind, learning very little about situation management along the way aside from tips that are not hard to work out yourself.\n\nThe worst part are the events. They're almost totally random. This would be ok if you maybe had a maximum of 2 events per turn. Usually you get 2-3, and require dice rolls totalling around 50 to complete them all. If you beat half that total, expect 30 on the next turn and so on. The feedback loop means that if you make a mistake, any mistake at all, its game over. If you do well, chances are its not going to matter. The research system seems to be the mitigating factor, athough you often require banking 4-6 specific dice in order to use these power-ups. Imagine playing a game like Left 4 Dead without the AI director. Just endless hordes of zombies to bash you until you die, and if you do get a MedKit, why not throw in a tank into the mix? My point is if the events were less random, and just showed a glimmer of hope for completing a day, the system would be less frustrating. Instead once the game decides to shut you down it just does it, no matter how well you've done up until that point.\n\nThere are more strategies available for beating the game when you have more characters available as synergy is clearly part of how to use the crew effectively. Using the Captain or Medic to provide small boosts to the team work well if the team is grouped together. Over the course of the game this can lose effectiveness as these crew work better when the group is at full size. But this is the part of the game that holds most weight in the strategy elements of the game.\n\nThe dice rolling aspect is a nice feature. Out of a potential 30 points, crew members can score an average of 17-18 points when fully functional. Penalties on these dice are strong. One prevents you re-rolling the dice, another removes the dice entirely and the third deals damage to your character. These penalties can vary in frequency and strength. One may remove a dice on any of three numbers. One can deal 3/6 damage to a crew member on a given number on a single dice roll. These can only be mitigated by preparation, and that preparation means you must sacrifice rolls earlier in the game. It adds a lot of frustration to the game, especially since the easiest difficulty still requires these large costs for single use effects.\n\nMany players have proven the game is beatable, and beatable by method. This shows that despite the randomness of the game there is a layer of depth and strategy in there. It just requires a good grind to get there and that just isn't fun. With each playthrough I don't look forward to getting a little bit further every time, because that isn't how the game works. It isn't designed to be fair, its designed to make you feel hopeless and it works.\n\nWill I play the game more? Yes I will. Is it beatable? Yes it is. Is this for everyone? No, its not. That said, a small amount of tweaking could make the decisions in the game more meaningful, more rewarding and/or less punishing when you do well. It doesn't need much, but the bit that is wrong is just holding the game back from a recommendation. Its not completely unfinished (though not all of the content is in the game yet) but it needs some attention, especially in the events department. Going from winning to game lost in a turn is not fun, needlessly sadistic and far too common. But if you like that kind of thing then this is your game. Otherwise, stick to FTL.\n\n* Post Review Edit * After beating the game on Normal I realise just how important it is to get a lucky break just to start the level on good terms. Some runs are just fubar from the start while others can help well with the first few days. Having the right event in the right room can carry you through the game, and its about forcing these events to remain open. However, getting these events in the first place is luck of the draw, but the longer you get through the campaign, the more likely it becomes. It didn't feel like an achievement to beat this one. I also had to use the synergies of the other characters to beat it. The Doctor and Mechanic just can't cut it, especially with their abilities being so weak. In all my review isn't really affected by the end game. It just reinforces the point the game needs attention.","January 22","false","8.7"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

The game is good while it lasts, but I'd pick it up on sale.\n\nThose who complain about it being RNG based - welcome to the genre. Playing smart *does* result in more wins than losses. You just have to strategize correctly. Took me a few YASDs, but I'm a veteran of hard-core roguelikes. 'Die and learn' is the order of the day. After a few failures, I figured out the best way to play the odds to capitalize on favorable odds, and minimize the bad rolls as much as possible.\n\nDoes it give you a giant middle-finger despite perfect play sometimes? Yep. It's part of dice games. It happens.

I personally find the devs could have implemented another thin layer of temporary bonuses when the player succeeds in repairing a room\nFirst, in order to mitigate the fact that fixing a dangerous equipment failure can perfectly give an even worst failure the very next turn, which sometimes entirely defeats the purpose and puts you in an insoluble dire situation.\nSecond, to add more meaning into the strategic management of resources vs the different bonuses each room provides. As of now for the latter it's more often than not a case of up for grabs because there was an equipment failure here and you had a lucky spare die lying there. Not always though, you still have to know when to capitalize on selected room bonus which will make the difference, even when there's no incident there.\nTransitional events (in between each weeks) could use some tweaking too, because even when your entire crew is at zero/very low stress you may still get a bad roll which will put an end to your smile.\n\nAnyways, don't let that repel you from experiencing what great mechanics and artistic designs this game has to offer, because in the end reaching your objective is really not the most interesting part of the game, which is being challenged by impossible odds aboard a collapsing skiff in the middle of the void.\n","January 12","true","8.9"," 3 of 10 people (30%) found this review helpful","30","3","10","0","0"

I really like the art, mood music and hard science that appears to be behind a lot of your decisions.  The game really does force you to understand the interplay between ship, health, current and future disasters, stress, and available resources.\n\nWhere it falls down is that that randomness almost always trumps any amount of strategic planning, careful dice hoarding or good choices.  I have played a number of times, altered my approach, and almost always come upon a turn where the number of 'points' I need to survive was just not mathematically possible even if I always rolled sixes.  Even if I had known when the disasters were going to occur and where, I still could not have prevented them.  I think the framework for fun is in place, but the odds are just so harsh and arbitrary.\n\nPerhaps this harsh reality is truly reflective of actual conditions in space.  But, if I'm playing a game I would like to feel that I can have some amount of influence, and that I'm going to eventually get closer to winning.  Unfortunately with Tharsis I feel like I'm at a Space Craps Table.  With Cannibalism.","February 1","false","20.9"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","0"

While the game is mainly bug free (2 crashes, closed straight to desktop), it seems to lack content. Might have been influenced to make this purchase after watching 'The Martian'.\n\nDon't get the 'challenge' part either, it's not that hard. With a bit of luck and a few re-rolls you can finish the game in under 30 mins.\n\nReview\nTL;DR: Game is lacks 'fun' right now (12/01/16).\n\nGameplay:\n- Fun... for maybe 20 mins. Starts going downhill fast from there.\n- Game is like a dice rolling simulator, given the correct conditions there is no real way to mess up. You just roll until your starting conditions are right and head straight to victory. Replay would be the same thing over and over, 1 run is maybe 20 mins long. No real incentive to repeat unless you really like rolling dice.\n- Couldn't care less for the crew members, if one or more die, go back to menu screen and re-roll. Playthrough isn't actually long enough for you to care about the crew or to stop you from starting over.\n\nContent / Features:\nThis is where the game falls short:\n\n- Cannablism is never really needed, it feels like its there for lulz. If you ever needed to cannablize a crew member your ship is doomed already.\n- Ship never changes structure, stays the same.\n- Scenarios, whatever they are, are TBA.\n- Story is soso, just says to rinse and repeat. Tried to create mystery but wasn't engaging. Not going to hang around to find out what supernatural forces are behind the cube.\n\nConclusion:\nCannot recommend this game in its current state and price, which is unfortunate since I had this on my wishlist since it was announced. While the graphics are slightly better than other micromanagement games like FTL and Endless Dungeon, Tharsis seems to offer far less value for money at this point. Lacks content would could have made it engaging and fails to provide an incentive to replay. Would have been more accurate to describe its current condition as 'Space dice rolling game. With some turn based mechanics. And a dash of cannibalism for good measure.'\n\nMight have expected something like this from an Early Access game, not a finished product. Hope developers find a way to improve on this in the future.","January 12","false","2.1"," 11 of 29 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","11","29","0","4"

It's as simple as that. What a waste. It's not fair in the least, and that's before it sets you behind the eight ball. There is no skill only blind luck. There are no employable strategies. It's you versus as bag of heavily weighted dice.\n\nThe game only seeks to do one thing and that's punish the player. Yes. I know you're looking at my stats, and saying "He only played it for fourteen minutes!"\n\nWell, there's a reason for that, because fourteen minutes was all I need to know what the game is about. It's that shallow. You send people to modules to fix catastrophic events, constant, catastrophic events.\n\nThe problem with the game is that the only events are those that can punish you. They might make it seem like there are positives to certain things, but they always undercut it with a negative, and an all negative game model doesn't work.\n\nI paid the realm of $9.89 dollars, and it was 34% off, and it wasn't worth that discounted price. It's the same punishing game over and over again, no variation. If you're looking for a disaster sim that basically puts mere mortals up against being smacked by God in the face.

I started off hating it SOOOOO much and was within a keypress of uninstalling and getting a refund, but luckily due to the shortness of a game (its saving grace) I stuck with it and it's started to grow on me.\n\nSo here are two reviews, the first is my original I HATE THIS GAME review, and then the second is my I DON'T HATE THIS GAME (HOWEVER IT COULD BE IMPROVED) review...\n\nI HATE THIS GAME REVIEW 1\n-------------------------------\nJust because this game is punishingly hard does not make it "old school" and also therefore does not automatically make it "good". This game is punishing but not in a good way. You are on a knife edge of survivability on every turn, and all it takes is a bad RANDOM dice roll, or a bad RANDOM deal of the research cards, or a bad RANDOM series of turn disasters and you are stuck in a situation where the only option is to quit and restart and there is no way the game mechanics can get you out of the situation, and that's just BAD design in my book, and to be honest I cannot see what the developers could do to resolve the issue. All this talk of "fate" is being a game apologist, this game is not balanced correctly. It is stacked to make you lose, but the kicker is that on the rare occasions you do win there is no sense of accomplishment as YOU haven't won, you just got lucky. Untimately you have as much control over your survival in this game as if the game was flipping 4 coins and you win if all 4 are heads, its just that the game takes longer and wraps it in pretty graphics, but untimately your influence on the ultimate outcome is just as minimal.\n\nI DON'T HATE THIS GAME (HOWEVER IT COULD BE IMPROVED) REVIEW 2\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nYou know what, most of the things I said above still apply but one major factor changed, how I approached the game. View the game like a card game of solitare, most of the time you are going to lose and a lot of the time that is due to how the cards were dealt, don't dwell on it, just swear, and restart the game and try again. This game should be viewed as a pleasant little 15 minute time waster, and nothing more, don't look for hidden greatness 'cos it isn't there, what you see if what you get. The more games I played, the more I started to get familiar with the mechanics (yes I don't need to try and stop that event as I can take the two damage this turn, and instead I can use the time I would have wasted to generate food that will give me +3 dice, and also regenerate another crew member's dice in another module so that next turn I am fully equipped to tackle it, and cycle some research cards, I might get some nasty random cards next turn, or I might not, I'll play it by ear), and realised that whilst the game is still 60% random, the other 40% strategy you have gives you just enough wiggle room to potentially tip things in your favour. You can still get totally obliterated by a set of unlucky dice rolls and random events, I've has crew members die from 4 health in one die roll in 3 different game (if you lose a crew member then just restart, no point in going on, don't make yourself suffer unduly) but the times that you do influence events it does give you a good feeling.\n\nThe narration is very well acted, but it become old and very repetative after just a couple of playthroughs, it would be nice to have multiple little 10 segment stories that changed completely every time you  won a game. In addition it might be helpful for people that would otherwise hate the game to have a set of "strike" cards that you could use to totally cancel an event, and you could set how many of these cards you got (maybe 1-3) at the start of the game, so you could play enough to understand all the mechanics of the game at your own pace, and slowly wean yourself off by reducing the number of strike cards you got deal until you were finally in a better mental position to have the full punishing Tharsis experience. Finally they need to sort out how they generate the random events as I don't believe they are properly balanced, far too often you can get events with 26+ costs that also include 3 dice of injury or void even on normal difficulty and it's nearly impossible to survive multiple occurances like that, there is a difference between being hard and being unfair.","January 20","false","22.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game's pretty damn cool though alright? The soundtrack is excellent, as is the atmosphere, and I find myself really enjoying the solitaire board game style gameplay. It hasn't worn out its welcome for me; any defeat just feels like a learning experience. I've never felt shorthanded by the game's design or RNG when I lose.  For the record, my win percentage is currently hovering around 11%, ostensibly because I've been toying around with playing on Hard with random crew, combined with lots and lots of losses as I was just learning the game's intricasies.  Because there's so much open-endedness as to what you prioritise in your efforts to make it to Mars, I don't think any defeat can be blamed solely on RNG. When you get the hang of it, the game is actually surprisingly well-balanced. Defeat is more due to poor planning and lack of foresight than raw RNG, and it's a shame so many people have dismissed this game as one that just tries to be as hard as it can just for the sake of difficulty.\n\nAnd there's something to be said about watching bloody dice roll around in low gravity at 60fps.","March 19","true","29.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

To the first, not really. I've managed a 20-25% win rate without too much effort. For the second, well, yeah. It's supposed to be that way. That's how randomness works. Sometimes you're going to be in impossible situations (as in real life), which perfectly fits the tone of the game, but on the whole it's about improving your efficiency and not what may happen with one poor roll. I won't ask you to take it on faith, but I do assert it is an integral feature of the gameplay and story.\nOh yes, the story. Outside the wonderful gameplay there is a quite interesting story. Music is also great along with overall design, with more features on they way.

If  you lack patience, forethought, or basic math skills then skip this one. 5/10 just barely recommend.\n\nTharsis is a gamblers game at heart.   All you can do is know (or guess at) the odds and play them in your favour as best you can.  I strongly reccomend that you watch two "let's play" before diving into this one, idealy one win and one horrible loss.  My tutorial playthough, which saw my entire crew dead then ship destroyed on the 4th turn, would have resulted in a refund request had I not researched and adjusted my expectations.  I see a lot of "It's like FTL", and I don't know if I agree entirely.  FTL can go terribly wrong sometimes but I feel you usually have a fighting chance far more often than in Tharsis.  FTL has more variety in positive things/traits/weapons/crew overall and lasts much longer in terms of events and time with which to correct/soften mistakes and bad luck.  Tharsis leaves little room for error and bad luck so recovery is rarely an option and you can't get new crew like in FTL. In my 20 or so plays I've had 3 wins and they were all steamrolls.  I would expect. looking back and going forward, that there is 1% area of middle ground between certain death and steamroll win.  Also, to be honest, unless the hard mode reveals a more extensive ending, the ending is pointless and doesn't answer the only question that arose during the cutscenes.  I mean, I know this isn't a grand narrative space opera but ALIENS?!?!?! as an ending is just lazy.  It felt empty and unrewarding, not in the sense that it was a shallow story, but that there was nothing resolved and nothing to validate or veil the fact that, over all your plays, you've basically just played a solo game of Yahtzee with no limit to the number of re-rolls or flipped a coin until you got tails 10 times in a row.  As a hardcore board gamer through and through, I will take real life dice rolls over mouse clicks any day, and this barely makes the cut as a video game. I don't think the price is too steep as it stands but I would prefer this as a $30 physical board game than as a video game.  My most frustrating issue is that the dice often don't even roll. I won't pretend to understand the rolling system but if it's physics based rather than RNG, then I hope they add some substantial spin on rolling.  When I roll 5 dice, get  1-1-1-2-4 and reroll all only to get 1-1-1-1-4 because they all stayed close together and kept eachother from rolling, it's a little too much to pass over as bad luck.\n\n**Edited**\nThis was originally an identically negative review.  I have found that once you have about 15 games under your belt and have a good grasp of the mechanics, the game eases into being a little friendlier.  It's all about the dice.  Nothing matters more than dice, everything (except a crew members life... most times...) is expendable when it comes to getting more dice, and getting to week 10 with a "+# ship" is a real game winner. Just drop everone in the flight control and dedicate all dice to research to end up with that 1 extra point that saves you.","January 20","true","6.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I do really like the ideas behind the game, and can now recommend it for folks who really want to stick out the learning curve. I have won only twice in all the hours I have played (14 hours at the time of this update), but now that I understand more how to play I have fun just trying to figure out how to go about taking on a round. It is also more fun now that I have more crewmen to choose from, not because any are particularly better than the others, but because it changes things up a bit.\n\nI appreciate the dev's comment to this review, and think that a better tutorial or a "learn to play mode" would really help improve the experience for a wider range of users.\n\nOne word of advice for new players: you might want to try to use the specialist to buy food in the early game and to get assists in mid to late game instead of having her work on events. Before I used her for this purpose she was more a liability than a help. After I started using her this way she became one of my core crew members.\n\nThanks to everybody who commented here. It helped me stick it out instead of abandoning the game.\n\n=============================\nI really, really, really want to like this game. The mechanics are awesome. The theme is awesome. Even the faces on the crew are awesome. But SOMETHING needs to be tweaked to balance the game. When three hits occur in the same turn with over 20 points required that each do 2 points of damage to the crew or ship, the game is out of balance. I don't want to win every time I play, but I don't want to feel that I never had a chance, either.\n\nEdit: This game would be tense, exciting, and FUN when the damage was just out of reach, where keeping the ship "ok" felt like an accomplishment and seeing what new events came on you made for another exciting round. As it is now, the damage pours on you like a 4 year old pouring syrup on pancakes. The balance, therefore, is immature. HA!\n\nThe developers are really onto something, but they aren't finished. In my view, the balancing has to be tweaked, or this thing becomes a great idea that did not materialize.","January 14","true","26.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","11"

To the first, not really. I've managed a 20-25% win rate without too much effort. For the second, well, yeah. It's supposed to be that way. That's how randomness works. Sometimes you're going to be in impossible situations (as in real life), which perfectly fits the tone of the game, but on the whole it's about improving your efficiency and not what may happen with one poor roll. I won't ask you to take it on faith, but I do assert it is an integral feature of the gameplay and story.\nOh yes, the story. Outside the wonderful gameplay there is a quite interesting story. Music is also great along with overall design, with more features on they way. I very much recommend this game!\n\nEdit: I noticed that some of the popular negative reviews have an hour of gameplay or less... So take that into account. Just beat hard mode again, so it's by no means as ridiculous as some claim.","January 17","true","20.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's extremely hard at first but, once you learn what you're doing its a LOT of fun.

I think this helps give it some extra replayability that it was missing before. In my opinion, it's well worth the $15.\n\nThe game was very fun, I enjoy games that require you to plan out multiple scenarios, sometimes risking it to survive, and sometimes losing it all.\n\nThe gameplay was pretty good, but I think the difficulty needs to be re-worked. I beat the game on the second try on easy, and then on my second try on hard. The game right now relies on an appropriate amount of RNG, so I think increasing the RNG to increase the difficulty would be a bad idea, so if there was a little more micro-managing to do or something, I think it would be better.\n\nHowever, I think that despite the lack of depth, it is a good game. It may or may not be worth the $15 to you, as of now, I would say it is.","January 12","true","10.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","2"
