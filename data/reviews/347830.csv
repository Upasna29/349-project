Put a couple of minutes aside. Pay full attention to me, because this isn't just a review. I'm going to pour my heart into this because I feel that's what this game deserves. This isn't just something you can score.\n\nAt first, this game's story is exactly like your standard anime, but it very quickly becomes something far greater. In my 32 hour campaign, there wasn't a single second in which I wasn't enjoying the absolute hell out of everything the game had to offer me. The adorable characters, the amazing story, the graphics of all of the spells...there wasn't a single second where I wasn't entertained.\n\nIt got to the point where once I reached the end of the game, I wasn't crying just because of the way the story ended, but also because of the very fact that the game is over now. Sure I knew I could do a new game plus, but something about finishing the game was just so heart wrenching. I can't even remember the last time I shed a tear, and I am a rather stoic man, so it symbolizes a lot that this amazingly emotional game managed to make me cry in different ways at the same time.\n\nSomehow, the repetitive combat isn't a bad thing. The spell effects of each and every spell are entertaining and beautiful enough to keep you interested in seeing them forever. Getting experience and skill points is fun no matter what, to the point where even the slightly-mandatory grinding is even fun. That's saying so much.\n\nPerhaps the most touching, is that it's a fully realized PC port. A game built with a JRPG engine has full mouse and keyboard support. Sure it seems like it would be standard for PC ports to have such things, but seeing a lack of mouse control in recent PC ports like DMC: Special Edition, it's hard not to feel grateful that the developers worked so hard to make mouse and keyboard work everywhere in this game. The amount of love they must have for this game must rival mine. And it does not surprise me, because it's extremely easy to fall in love with this game. You will have to practice the keyboard controls a bit (it took me a little bit to find out that Page Up and Page Down helps you aim your spells in combat, and Page Up re-centers your camera when exploring dungeons) but it won't take long, and the game's turn-based nature is very conducive with this control scheme, ensuring you have as much time as you need to figure out how, and where, to aim your spells. Give it a while, and you won't notice any difference in speed from casting a spell at the right position using a keyboard or a controller.\n\nAnd to top it all off; my girlfriend gifted me this game and all of its dlc's. Even if it wasn't such an amazing game, it would be worth appreciating simply because she got it for me. But it turned out to be my personal game of the year. Deandra, I love you, and I can't thank you enough for giving me this art, and I can't thank Compile Heart and Idea Factory enough for creating it.","August 15, 2015","true","37.1"," 800 of 975 people (82%) found this review helpful 94 people found this review funny","82","800","975","94","29"

If you haven't, read on.\n\nA) Fairy Fencer F is goofy, totally nonsense JRPG from Compile Heart, with the least (most?) likeable main character ever. However, because of its cute supporting characters, entertaining (if somewhat grindy) battle system, hilarious (sometimes hilariously bad) dialogue, and genuinely interesting story premise, I had a really difficult time putting it down last night.\n\nSo you're Fang, an extremely lazy kid who by total happenstance becomes a Fencer, charged with collecting the Furies (magical weapons fallen to Earth) to unseal the goddess. Sounds simple, right? Well... not really. You also have the option to unseal her opponent, the Vile God (but who would do that, right?!) So the game doesn't seem to mind giving the player options in this regard, and it seems to be set up for multiple endings.\n\nTo  keep it short and sweet, if you're a fan of well made JRPGs, cute things and mixed humour, there is no reason in the world you shouldn't like this. The port runs extremely well (*cough* Arkham Knight *cough*), so go ahead, pick it up and give it a try. The worst thing that could happen is you don't like it and refund it. BUT WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?!\n\n\nB) Get it. More of the same moe awesomeness and cheesy humour, with a male main character (more character variety in general.) Almost identical battle system. A little less refined, but it works well. You'll love it.","August 5, 2015","true","27.1"," 199 of 225 people (88%) found this review helpful 27 people found this review funny","88","199","225","27","10"

The two deities didn’t fight directly, but created a large number of special weapons imbued with their godly energy, each containing the life force of a fairy for others to use. Eventually, these powers sealed each other and the power vanished from the world. Going into modern times, warriors that wield the powers (Furies) are known as "Fencers."\nFairy Fencer F places you in the role of Fang reluctant hero that is more interested in his next meal, becomes a Fencer—warrior chosen by The Goddess to become companions to fairies, who are magical beings who can transform into a variety of weapons called "Furies" and warriors that wield them are "Fencers".\nFury weapons are said to be incredibly powerful, so Fencers constantly scramble to acquire them. By a strange coincidence, fang finds himself rescuing a young woman named Tiara, who is also a Fencer as well. This fateful encounter between two Fencers has dire consequences, and Fang soon finds himself involved in the ongoing conflict between the Goddess and Vile God.\n\nGameplay and important elementsUnlike most JRPGs, you don't equip any new weapons in Fairy Fencer F. Since each Fencer is bound to one fairy partner, you instead upgrade your fairy to increase its capabilities and powers which is unique. (Unless you have the DLC weapons then equipping weapons will affect stats)\n\nThe combat system is close to Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth 1 and 2. So hyperdimension fans you can feel at ease getting this game as you should be familiar with it.\n\nThe dialogue and voice acting are both well done, and the soundtrack is really nice as the soundtracks blends perfectly with the action going on in your screen.\nAs for the combat the characters special attacks have flashy animations. It is like watching a really cool anime. For example, Fate franchise.\n\nTo sum it up Fairy Fencer F is a enjoyable way to spend 45-50 hours for 1 play through, and would definitely recommend it to, JRPG fans, Anime lovers or those who want to try somethwing new.\n\nOfficial website links http://www.compileheart.com/fairyfencer_f/        -japanese website\nhttp://nisamerica.com/games/fairyfencerf/#/top  -english website","August 4, 2015","true","433.5"," 192 of 257 people (75%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","75","192","257","5","12"

Older video cards can disable shadows and effects to gain an fps boost (also found in the .ini).\n\nPerformance aside the game is quite fun to play!

He isn't afraid to tell people off and doesn't opt into heroic deeds mindlessly.\n+Combat: There is a wide variety of spells and skills, and the combo system is great.\n+Art: The character portraits are varied, distinct, and well constructed.\n+UI: It might not be the most minimal UI, but it is well thought out, looks nice, and has a lot of options for easy navigation (excluding page up/page down requirement.)\n+Sound: Satisfying navigation sounds...and...come on, that music though.\n+Dynamic: There are ways to change the difficulty, types of mobs, and rewards you encounter.\n+Progression: Every levelup really feels like it makes you better, and there are so many things you can upgrade and level.\n+Convenience: You can skip animations and dialogue with ease!\n+Save Slots: Thankfully, as is standard, there are plenty to use.\n+Settings: Plenty to mess around with.\n+Tutorial: While at first a bit obtrusive in the "Try walking to walk!" sense, it is actually very comprehensive, and you will have zero holes in your knowledge of how to play. This also makes the game EXTREMELY kid friendly.\n\nCons I wish to state these are minor, except the last two.\n-Story: Relatively generic, but it does have its good points.\n-Dialogue: Tropes and lack of inspiration abounds. However, I like the references, and I think some of it is meant to be in the spirit of parody.\n-Camera: It sort of moves on its own...slowly, and you can move it yourself...slowly.\n-Performance: This is a VERY minor con, but there are ocassional slowdowns when loading an area, and expect to potentially wait a bit if you tab out of the game.\n-Strategy: Or the lack thereof. Unfortunately resistances, normal attacks, and weaknesses are not differentiated enough to make you REALLY hurt if you don't plan, and often party positioning is of very little significance.\n-Fodder: The regular mobs quickly become walking goodies and experience that pose little threat. As you progress, most of the bosses will also enter this category.\n\nNeutral+/- While the level design in terms of art can be fairly varied, unfortunately, many assets or whole levels are recycled. So I'm a bit mixed on this one.\n+/- Fanservice: While almost always tame (excluding harley...) it does exist.\n\n======================================\nIntroduction\nWelcome to Fairy Fencer F...yep, that's a name! In Fairy Fencer F, the big bad and the big good fought a long battle ages ago and both were sealed as a result. In this world, the divine weapons they fought with/used to seal each other are called Furies, and are essentially inhabited by/an alternate form of Fairies. Those who wield the Furies and collect the Fairies to attempt to unseal the Goddess or Vile God are called Fencers.You play a Fencer called Fang, who likes Food.\n\nGameplay\nIn Fairy Fencer F, scenes and towns act like menus in a visual novel, while the overworld map is a literal map with interest points you can visit. Upon entering one of these areas, you can move freely. In battle, each character can move within a certain circumferance each turn, and you can select skills/magic from an easily accessible menu, or just hit enter to attack it normally. You can also use the menu for special abilities and to select items.\n\nWhile the story is, broadly speaking, cliche, I like a lot of its finer points. An easy example is that while black force and white force waged war and both fell, it is up to you to do the work to unseal them, you get to choose who, and you get a share of the power from extracting the weapons sealing them. Likewise, the game allows a lot of variety in dungeons through "World Shaping," a feature that lets you alter the properties of the dungeons such as exp/item rewards, the mobs themselves, or outright give yourself certain buff/debuffs.\n\nCombat is relatively fun, and the combo system makes it unexpectedly engaging. The downside to combat, however, is the almost complete lack of strategy required. You'll probably always win no matter what you do.\n\nGraphics\nSo the graphics are a mixed bag. They're good...in a way. The art can have a lot of variety, and this includes the level design art, but the levels themselves can be outright rehashes if not just using rehashed assets. I think the UI is overall nicely done, but some of the elements could be a bit sharper or have a bit less/more going on. The character art is pretty great, actually, but...you won't see much animation. This is pretty much the common trend. "Nice enough...but."\n\nI think that even with all of its faults considered, the graphics really are entirely fine, its just that in comparison to modern games it could use a facelift/seems dated. An easy example would be how much this game would benefit from better/higher res textures in the dungeons. Are they horrible? No, they look decent, just not good, and the quality itself is lacking...blurry/etc.\n\nAudio\nThe audio in Fairy Fencer F has far fewer counterpoints than everything else. The music can be quite nice, as background ambience or high-octane bloodpumpers, but you're going to get a bit tired of hearing some things repeatedly. I find, unlike many games, that the menu sound hits the sweet spot between pleasant and assertive.\n\nWhile I quickly switched from English to Japanese, I didn't find the voice acting to be especially bad in the English, but the voices themselves kind of took away from the experience for me. On the other hand, the Japanese voice acting was better than expected. The voices suit the characters, the timing, and the emotions seemed synced to where they should be in delivery.\n\nOverall the sound is good when you notice it, unobtrusive when you don't. I did have ONE issue with it: there is a very jarring popping sound that randomly occurs.\n\nConclusion\nThis is a fairly solid JRPG, great for a dive into a new world, and good for fans of the genre, but not for those who really want to be challenged. If you like easy or story-based games, or even just having a little fun while unlocking/collecting things, this is a good choice. Great as a genre introduction or for young kids.\n\nI will repeat: If you want to be challenged (Dark Souls, SMT, Mother, Valkyria Chronicles, etc.) you should definitely look elsewhere. Otherwise...I think it is worth the full price.\n\n======================================\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group","October 10, 2015","true","47.0"," 54 of 66 people (82%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","82","54","66","3","16"

I'll edit the review if I see the need to as I playthrough the game.\nThis is going to be very simple pros and cons to get straight to the point, and make some comaprisons with Hyperdimension Neptunia, since that's what a lot of the people buying into this are expecting.\n\nCharacters Fang, Eryn and Tiara are fantastic comedy-centered characters. However, these are the only characters that will give you the same feel as Neptunia. Not only that, but every other playable character is almost completely insignificnt. (Minus a betrayal or two.) The voice acting is fantastic; both Japanese, and English. The art and character sprites are much better than in Neptunia.\n\nDungeons The dungeons aren't copy pastes of eachother. That's right, did going through the same exact landscape OVER, AND OVER in Neptunia get on your nerves? You don't have you worry about it for this. Some of the dungeons are far more expancsive as well. Regardless, however, many still aren't the most visually appealing.\n\nCombat Almost a copy-paste of Neptunia's system. There are some differences, such as the tension gauge, which is used to Fairize (Essentially the characters transformation, like that CPU forms in Neptunia.). You do not equip weapons, because each weapon is bound to the character it is equips on. Instead you power up your character with WP you gan through battle.\n\nGrinding The grinding in Fairy Fencer F is much worse than Neptunia. Although the game does not pose very much difficulty, you'll still be killing the same enemies OVER AND OVER to amass WP, to power up your weapons. WP is earned maybe 2-3 per battle, and is used to dictate your weapons Physical attack Power, to its Range, special attacks, normal combo attacks and even the amount of hits it gets in a combo. It also gets to the point where a single power up can cost 1000 WP. So get ready for the grind train when you go to play this.\n\nStory It's pretty generic for jRPG games. Sealed dieties that split their power in the past. Hero finds a "fragment" of the power and continues on a journey to unseal the "goddess", while the badguys try to unseal the "demon lord". You'll basically fight one badguy at a time sent by the enemy organization until you reach the end of the game. All threee ending are lackluster. Once again, it's Idea Factory, and Compile Heart's characters that make the game.\n\nOptimization They overlayed the buttons for default keyboard use; which they didn't do for Re;Birth's steam release. This makes it much easier to get used to the mapping. There's always full controller support as well if you're still having trouble. There's much more mouse support than Neptunia. YOU CAN MOVE AROUND WITH THE MOUSE. REVOLUTIONARY. I haven't had too many FPS issues, as I did with Re;Birth (Mainly Sister Generation) but, I'm newer to computer gaming, so I don't have much experience with FPS issues in the first place. Most of the DLC comes with the product. Of course, these are originally free DLC in the first place, but at least you don't need to go download them one by one like I had to do on the playstation store. It looks like they'll release the paid DLC in the future as well.\n\ntl;dr It's definetly a different experience than Neptunia, but you'll see the similarities. The grinding made me want to break the game disk; but now that I baught the game on steam I'll experience it all over again.\nHowever, it is most definetly worth the money.","August 4, 2015","true","39.4"," 66 of 92 people (72%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","72","66","92","4","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/RiRiGao/recommended/347830/","RiRiGao","ℜitz","http://steamcommunity.com/id/RiRiGao/","292 products in account","Its good, a traditional JRPG with a few gimmicks such as a heavy visual novel approach (Tears to Tiara 3, Hyperdimension for example) and  extremely flashy encounters that you'de normally see on consoles.  Some of the best parts of this game, despite the combat being simplistic is how pretty it looks.  All of the spells, and abilities have their own little cutscene and  all actions happen snappily and quickly. The audio is good, the English dub is liveable but the Japanese dub is better (especially if you understand things that don't translate well).\n\nThe story is anime influenced and is more on the silly/moe side of that.  It is a fun story, nothing too serious and  slightly cliche at points.  The story is self aware of just how cliche it can feel, and sometimes makes fun of itself.  There is a deeper undertone but I doubt it'll matter.  Now get the boy his damn /FOOD/!  It is more cohesive then most straight up Visual Novels, but there isn't much choice as it only has 3 possible endings without much deviation in your activities.\n\nAs a PC port, it works perfectly.  And really that is the #1 criteria for any game that exists. The game only has resolution settings, including borderless mode.  That is pretty much all there is for PC related enhancements, everything looks crisper and cleaner then the console version so I can't really find anything to complain about this.   Its a fast game, the FPS feels smooth, the action is smooth.\n\nOverall it is a fun game to play, especially at its current price of $15.  Its a competent port, and is pretty to look at.  Its a bit easy, so you won't enjoy this game if you want a challenge.  Nor will you want this game if you're looking for a deep engaging story that will make your brain think on all cylinders.  But if you want something light hearted and easy to digest then this games story will pass for you.

Most people that catch me playing it think it looks really cool, and you get that feeling while playing it too. The dialogue is often funny and the characters will even surprise you, but it's still as a whole a kind've hollow experience.\n\nIt's easy to become overpowered, the monsters and environments aren't very diverse, the story is pretty generic with no real revelations or challenges, and sometimes the characters seem bored and flippant about everything that going around, not to mention the bad guys aren't very interesting or intimidating. Depth is certainly not the games forte, but I didn't end up minding it too much.\n\nIt's actually kind of nice to have nothing invested sometimes, the characters almost seem aware that they're in a silly JRPG and the developers put in plenty of missables/grinding/extras for people hoping for more of a challenge. There's so much fun small stuff packed in, like all 39 of the furies you can collect having something to say about current events, or buffing/debuffing areas to grind more efficiently. Lots of cool ideas with the battle system, even though it mostly doesn't matter since you can blow away anything in the main game after level 40. Even though the characters aren't going to have any complex problems or feelings, they are all colorful and enjoyable, I ended up liking everyone and having a hard time choosing my party.\n\nIf you really dig playing RPGs and don't mind a bit of repetivieness and grasping plot points, it's a really fun game.

You can skip reading this and pick it up as you will fit right into Fairy Fencer F.\n\nFairy Fencer F ditches the futuristic feel of the Hyperdimension games and returns to the more traditional scene. Countryside with shopkeeps and all kinds of taverns. It feels very Atelier-esque. Basically, Hyperdimension Neptunia, but set in the scenery of Atelier Rorona/Atelier Totori.\n\nYou play as Fang, a male main character and meet Nep-Nep in red hair and wings Eryn, a fairy that inhabits a weapon. Together you must find 100 other fairies to revive the Goddess and stop the Vile God from destroying the world\n\n...you know, standard JRPG stuff.\n\n\nWhile I joke about Fairy Fencer F being Hyperdimension Neptunia in a different setting, FFF actually does a good job in separating itself from HN. Sure there are Nep references here and there (Pudding!) but on the whole, FFF really does feel like it's own universe.\n\nIf anything, the game sort of feels too short. It's about half of Hyperdimension Neptunia. Half the party members, half the dungeons, half the items and half the length to beat a playthrough.\n\nOne thing FFF beats Neptunia over though, is a fully fleshed out combo system for attacks. While Special Attacks are rather limited (Each Character has around ~5 of these) the standard attacks can be combo'd with an insane amount of styles. Your weapon will automatically shift from a sword, to a gun, to a scythe or arrow depending on how you set up your chain attacks. Also, the EXE gauge returns in the form of "Fairize". Build up the gauge and Fairize to do double the damage.\n\nAnother thing that FFF does uniquely, is the Fairies themselves. I really liked this. You can assign any fairy you have to any of your party members, and each Fairy has different stats to boost the character with. Equip a Fairy that gives you bonus Fire damage to a member who specializes in Fire attacks to do insane damage.\n\nI wish there were more fairies though -- the game says you have to find 100 fairies to revive the goddess, yet I believe there are only around ~45 fairies you can actually obtain. They all range from badass dragons and monsters to cutesy fox girls and buff tough-talking dudes. They each have their own charm (they are all fully voiced too!) and I just loved collecting all of these different kinds of fairies.\n\nI would have liked to of had an option to take fairies from defeated foes.

Exactly! What's not to like?\nThat's why I easily can recommend this game for everybody. You can stop reading here and go play a game. Want to know more? keep reading\n\nThe game has fairy simple and straightforward story, the battle between good and evil, it's not particularly interesting but passable. Characters are not bad, even though some of them have seelie habits.\n\nBut most importantly a game is fun to play. How fun? In sprite of being very combat heavy it doesn't feel like it, mostly because dungeons aren't big and manageable in one sit.\n\nEnough puns, let's get serious.\nOnto combat itself. All characters have skills (unique to character), magic, physical attacks of different weapons styles and one special skill which can be used in fairisied form. All of those have range, hit count and power. String of attacks until you are hit by enemy is a combo of course and you'll get that tingly feeling all over after launching a good one, also you can trigger avalanche attacks and do aerial combos. All this makes combat varied and fun.\n\nThere is a slight balance issue, though. A game is supposed to be played at least twice, first time around it feels like you are underleveled most of the time, the second time that you are too powerful already. It could have been easily avoided by having normal and hard modes, imo. On the bright side, it being as it is, makes all playthroughs after the first one really fast.\n\nAnd not so good part: some of those ingame challenges and some achievements are mean, unfair and unnecessary time consuming.","September 17, 2015","true","106.7"," 59 of 88 people (67%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","67","59","88","15","0"

Everything I write in this review applies equally to the PC & PS3 versions.\n\nThe Story & CharactersAs with every "long" review of mine, I always ignore writing down the entire story & will just give my thoughts right away.\nBeing a massive follower of Hyperdimension Neptunia, I was hoping for the same goofyness from Neptunia to transfer into Fairy Fencer F. And while part of it did, this story is pretty much anything but goofy. It has its moments, yes, but they're rather far inbetween.\nAnyway, the story itself? I really enjoyed it, believe me. However, I felt like certain aspects of it felt very underdeveloped or just straight up ignored. The game throws in things that seem important to do & give you a lot of pressure for doing it wrong only for the first time. After that first time, the game pretty much doesn't care what you do. And that's what irks me.\nThe most underwhelming part about the story are definitely the characters. I'm sorry, no matter what the story did with the characters, 8 times out of 10 I just ended up not really caring much. The characters in this game feel very stereotypical, predictable & boring. The villains & their boss battles suffer greatly from this. Consistently throughout the game, it constantly tries to shove into your face that these villain characters are villains and you should try to do whatever it takes to defeat them. Then you defeat them and the game goes like "ok lol xd lets go now", failing to give a lot of importance to the characters.\nIt does try to develop the "good guy" characters as well and I particularly enjoy what they did with Tiara, Fang & Eryn, but it does a poor job with Tiara and an exceptionally poor job on everyone else. The "good guy" characters, while faithful to Fang, always seem too predictable and almost never do anything other than the occassional "WE GOT YOUR BACK XD"\nSo yeah, I liked the story, but the characters could've definitely used some work. A great step backwards from the Hyperdimension Neptunia series.\n\nThe GameplayBut as with every game, the story can be underdeveloped, sure, but as long as the gameplay is fun - I can look past the story. I'm happy to report, being a very active Neptunia player, that Fairy Fencer F was an insanely fun game to play. Admittedly, it was a bit of a rocky start. Getting used to the Weapon Boost mechanic was definitely the most difficult part of this game for me specifically, but once I got used to it - I practically never stopped using it and kept constantly checking it. Other than that, the battle system is great. It's fun to use the characters in battle & grinding doesn't always p*ss me off. I mentioned that the boss battles have little impact in the story character-wise, that doesn't mean that the battles themselves weren't fun to play. And they were! The boss battles in this game for me were an enjoyable time!\nNow, lemme do some explaining. First - Weapon Boost. After every battle, apart from the Prologue, you get Weapon Boost Points, or WP for short. This WP allows you to use the points you gathered in the "Weapon Boost" menu to make your character's stats better, such as increasing their Physical or Magical Attack, etc. WP can also be used to learn new skills and new Overworld abilities, which I found great. The WP system is implemented very well and the distribution of it will require just a bit of grinding, but it's almost always a rather painless task, especially with Shukeeso's Tower.\nWhile playing through the story, or rather - the first half of the story, you will get what are known as Fairies. These Fairies can be equipped on your characters, providing them with increased stats & certain benefits, such as elemental resistance or passive abilities such as Paralysis Null. Fairies are implemented pretty well into the core gameplay & I'd even consider it a very important part of the game, in a way. There's no reason for you to not use Fairies, unless, you know, you want to make this game harder for yourself, which I won't stop you.\nBasically, the gameplay is fun & every gameplay mechanic is implemented very well.\nBut the gameplay has many flaws, kinda like the story.\nThe biggest problem to me was that the game was way too easy. This is saying a lot from a guy who absolutely hates grinding & I avoided doing quests & grinding pretty much throughout the entire game. And I rarely had a hard time playing. It was only at one point in the game when I actually had a difficult time beating a certain boss and it was nearing end-game against 3 Eryn copies. It was, to be quite frank, the only "difficult" boss battle in the entire game to me.\nThe next major flaw (to me) is the overworld common enemy AI. It's predictable. And sometimes very broken, getting stuck right in front of you. This has happened to me on more than one occassion, when an overworld enemy was right in front of me and would never move, no matter what I did, forcing me to fight just so I could proceed. I hate random encounters and was kinda hoping that I'd be able to avoid most of them, and I was, but every now and then - the broken AI can cheat on you a bit.\nOne more flaw is what I mentioned was a seemingly important part about the game - Godly Revival. It's completely pointless and does not affect the game story-wise. The only thing I found Godly Revival useful for was giving the Fairies I collect some extra perks in battle, so I can have an even easier time fighting in an already easy game.\nThe last thing I'll mention about the gameplay are the boss battle flaws. This is one thing that I absolutely hated about the game, and it's when the game interrupts the battle mid-battle to show you a cutscene and then restart the battle, restoring the boss to full HP, while you have wasted your SP & took some HP damage. This consistently happens throughout the game and it's very very annoying.\nThat's pretty much it for the gameplay. It's great, it's fun, but definitely could be more difficult and has its other flaws.\n\nThe SoundFirstly - the English dub. Yes, I played this game for about 10 hours with the English dub. What do I think? It's...not bad, actually. I rather like the English dub. The voice actors actually do a good job at representing the characters as they are & the acting itself is kinda good. I'm impressed. Obviously though, as I'm an absolute purist, I played the second half of the game in Japanese, which was aesthetically better, given how the game came from Japan to begin with.\nThe soundtrack? Guys, it's good. Compile Heart has never really made any songs that "stuck" with me, apart from Dimension Tripper, Miracle*Portable Mission & Vert's theme, all from Hyperdimension Neptunia, but Fairy Fencer F has a slur of powerful & enjoyable songs that I like listening to even outside the game. A fantastic example is the game's opening song - Resonance World. It's incredible and shows off a similar quality of songs throughout the game. Definitely an upgrade over Hyperdimension Neptunia, great job, Compile Heart!\n\nOverallI enjoyed the story to an extent, but the characters were quite predictable & boring. The gameplay was fun, and while it did have its issues, I found everything else too good to really care about the issues. Both the English & Japanese dubs were great & the game's soundtrack was exceptionally good.\nOverall, yes, I enjoyed myself thoroughly in Fairy Fencer F and I'm looking forward to my New Game+ runthroughs.\nI don't recommend it for full price, however, get it on a discount.\n\n7/10","December 6, 2015","true","36.7"," 23 of 26 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","23","26","2","2"

It’s also a console port, and as such, it has some peculiarities.\n\nFairy Fencer F is basically a turn-based RPG with beautiful anime-styled art. When you’re not dungeon-crawling, you have a view of static maps and Visual Novel styled conversations with other characters. When you are dungeon crawling you get those same anime characters in 3D view. You only see the party leader until you enter a battle, and you can only choose so many of your friends to battle with you.\nBattles are turn based, but not static. You can move freely around a predesigned circular area of reach (and sometimes enemies will be outside this area), which gives you a sense of freedom despite the limitation, something move-by-places or only-x-steps type of turn based games don’t give you.\n\nThe sound and voices are very nice and very fitting to the whole anime/fantasy theme, and I’m particularly fond of the song used when you use “fairize”; it reminds me lots of the songs in Persona 3 and 4. By the way, did I mention you can choose between English and Japanese voices? Because you totally can. It had my heart right then and there.\n\nNow, I’ll try to explain this as best I can. Basically you play as Fang, a Fencer, that is: a person who can wield Furies, which are weapons that contain fairies that add powers to the weapon/wielder. Your job is to go out and search for more furies - each one you get will grant you a new fairy. You can add these to your own weapon as “resonance” to make it stronger and give you some extra stats. The fairies you’re currently using gain experience along with you and level up. Fairies are also ranked - the rank is used to remove the seals (swords) on the Goddess/God. While the story tells you to remove the Goddesses’ seals, after the tutorial you can choose to remove the Vile God’s seals as well, which is a neat touch! Each seal removed successfully adds different boosts/stats to the fairy used to remove it, which in turn adds it to you if it’s the one you’re using as resonance. Fairies that aren’t currently being used in your weapons can be stabbed as their fury forms on the world map in order to provide various boosts, buffs and debuffs in the nearby dungeons (for instance, earn more exp, or gold, or drop rate… ). Since you can stab more than one fury into the ground, you can get quite a few boosts while on a single dungeon.\n\nYou have combos for physical attacks which you can customize, and you can at a fly switch between three different ones while attacking by simply pressing one key instead of another, all comfortably close by. Because you have so many ways to affect stats and boosts, the system ends up being quite flexible and enjoyable to play with.\nIt’s a very interesting concept and I feel like I don’t do it justice explaining it thus briefly.\n\nSaving is done through specific spots while inside a dungeon, or at any time within the world/city maps. While in the city you get to speak with a lot of characters and take up quests that can give you some prizes and can also be repeated (indefinitely, as it seems). The quests are fairly typical, but quick to get done, and go along with what rank you are. You can also craft some items to help on your journey. There is some romance in this game.\n\nBecause this was a console port, the controls at first can be a bit awkward (for instance, you can’t use esc to exit menus, you must use backspace; you can use the mouse too, but it’s really more of a hassle than using only the keyboard); however, once I grew used to them they were actually very sensibly placed and quite comfortable to use. I ended up using just the keyboard all the time.\n\nI do wish the game was free-roaming rather than turn based, and the fights do get a tad repetitive after a while, making the fighting aspect of the game feel a tad like a grind. However, the story is nice and full of funny moments and the characters are cute and extremely likeable, all of them with their own personalities, doubts and insecurities.\n\nThe game really makes you want to collect all the fairies and remove the seals to see what will happen, keeping you hooked with the story. It also offers a New Game Plus + mode upon completion, which I always love but haven’t yet reached. Fairy Fencer F is a delightfully long game (with 30+ hours if you’re playing through just the main storyline, and over a 100 if you’re going for completion), but from what I’ve seen so far I’m confident in recommending this game to everyone who is into JRPGs.","August 22, 2015","true","13.1"," 27 of 34 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","27","34","0","3"

This is likely due to it being more CPU intensive to begin with, but even then I am seeing no hiccups with my i5-4460 and my HD5750, running Windows 10 Pro x64 - in other words, the game runs smoothly at 60fps (which is the default lock as per the .ini file, but may be unlockable).\nThere are no in-game graphics options to speak of besides resolution and a fullscreen/windowed/borderless toggle, but then you'll hardly need more, seeing the game's artstyle and heavy reliance on animated 2D backgrounds and sprites. Further graphics settings may be available in the .ini file again, and AA can be forced via your graphics vendor's control panel regardless.\nSettings for controls, sound and so on are all there, including manual button remapping for your gamepad (which should help with getting non-standard Xinput pads to work), and Voice, Movie, Effects and BGM volumes have separate sliders, as they should have.\n\nFrom a gameplay standpoint, the game is close to Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth, which it supposedly shares the engine with. If you've played Neptunia, you'll find it easy to get into the systems, though even after an hour of playtime, there are differences and additions in Fairy Fencer F.\n\nThose differences include the Tension meter that raises/lowers your stats in combat and allows you to transform at a certain point (whereas Neptunia gave you more free reign with transformations), "boosting" weapon stats, learning new skills and what not through using them to earn and assign points, attaching Fairies to your characters for added perks, switching weapon styles to increase certain parameters like crit chance, speed and the likes, and Character Challenges which reward you with stat increases for various gameplay milestones.\nThese challenges also encourage cycling through your party members, as some of them demand a character to be the party leader or do things only the leader is able to. It is a nifty system I'm looking forward to explore more in-depth, as it should keep things fresh (if a little grindy in the higher ranks, I expect).\nOverall, the gameplay system at least feels more complex in terms of customization and late-game options than Neptunia (though take my judgement with a grain of salt - I'm not that far in yet).\n\nThe story and characters up to now seem like a good combination. The character dynamic between the protagonist and his fairy partner are funny and lighthearted, which reminds of Neptunia, but appears far more grounded and less preposterous than Nep did. If Gamindustri felt too wacky and over the top to you, Fairy Fencer F might deliver a more enjoyable experience.\nThe basic plot is very simple in theory: Collect all the Fury weapons and revive the Goddess, explore dungeons, talk to people in towns (again, more grounded than in Neptunia, though very similar in execution), and fill your protagonist's stomach.\n\nThe art design and music are straight-up gorgeous, as would be expected from the team behind them (which includes Nobuo Uematsu as composer and Yoshitaka Amano on the art, two big creatives that made Final Fantasy so good in its glory days). Fairy Fencer F offers some top-notch, high quality art in the typical J-RPG/Anime style.\n\nOverall, I am pleased with my purchase, and will continue playing it.","August 4, 2015","true","7.1"," 44 of 64 people (69%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","69","44","64","2","0"

AND, most importantly :\nBattles are EXTREMELY easy.\nI'm not talking about it being not challenging enough if you know what you're doing, no, you can literally kill everything in this game with one or two basic attacks. Including bosses, and you always act first. This is even more annoying when the game tells you via cutscenes that the upcoming boss is supposed to be super powerful and all, and then you almost one-shot them on the first turn, at which point the fight is interrupted by another cutscene that shows your characters inexplicably getting the crap beaten out of them. Followed by some Cutscene Power To The Max they throw you back into the fight and you now proplerly one-shot the boss. It's really stupid and happens many times throughout the story.\n\nEnemies do so little damage that it's virtually impossible to lose. I was surprised to see that there was no achievement for getting a game over. which I was only able to get after stacking various damage increasing effects on a dungeon (quadruple damage - for your party and enemies alike) and randomly missing my first attack against a boss.\n\nAnd if it wasn't clear by now, there is no difficulty slider or anything. At. All.\n\nThe dungeon design is acceptable, but eventually reaches the pinnacle of laziness when they send you back in time halfway through the "story" and make you go though all the previous dungeons again, with the same enemies and the exact same bosses.\n\n\n\nFairy Fencer F is one of those generic low budget JRPGs that usually get scores around the 55-65% mark.\nIf you've really already burned yourself out on every other JRPG out there, you could probably grab this. but if you're playing your games for the story or the battles you're going to be disappointed.\n","September 11, 2015","false","38.6"," 178 of 298 people (60%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","60","178","298","12","11"

I don't hate this game, I'm just very disappointed in my experience with it. If anything, I want to like this game more than I actually do. With that said, onto the review.\n\nTL;DR version: A pretty bland game with bland characters, a bland story and bland combat. It's not worth nearly 30€ for this. If you plan to get it, get it while it's at least 50% off.\n\nI came into this game from Idea Factory's Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth 1 and 2, expecting it to be a somewhat more serious but still a lighthearted JRPG. For the most part, I got that. However, as I dug deeper into the game, there were so many different things that got to me that didn't really make my experience any more enjoyable.\n\nMy first problem is with the characters. They're not all that interesting, good character development happens mostly for 3 characters only (out of a possible 14) and I found none of the characters to be anything special. For example, Fang is a selfish guy who just wants to live his life the way he wants but eventually has to mature up to be a hero-type, Tiara is a noble-like character who seems to have a fetish for being verbally degenerated (I'm not kidding, she seems to get these moments of euphoria every time she's called the b-word), Pippin is a walking talking cat pillow that's supposed to resemble something of a veteran noble or something... Then there's Harley... I'll let you guess what she's all about with the help of this link. In short, none of the characters have anything that makes them especially interesting (other than a few small quirks), which makes them kind of bland in my eyes.\n\nWithout spoiling the game, the plot doesn't really hold water for me either. The objective is stated at the very start of the game: "Collect furies, revive the Goddess, you win". Pretty much towards the end of the game the objective stays the same, until some small changes happen here or there. The story itself isn't so bad that it's hateable, but when you're finished with the game you'll be left with several plot holes that you don't really get an answer to. In addition, not many moments really stuck with me as I progressed through the game. I guess the word that describes the plot is bland. In addition, there are some plot related things that left me with more questions than answers. Those would fall under spoilers, however, so I won't talk about them.\n\nHow about character levelling and combat? Well, coming from the HDN games, they're definitely different. The game uses a system called "Weapon Boost" to make your character better. Through combat you gain WP, which you will use to level up character stats as well as to learn skills, magic, abilities and new combo techniques. It's a rather simple system, but it might require the player to grind a bit to unlock some of the stuff he or she wants but overall, I like it. The combat still seems to come short of being interesting though. Comparing it to the HDN combat system, I feel it's easier to navigate menus and harder to make silly mistakes like cancelling your own turn because you accidentally pressed the cancel button twice when trying to leave the item menu. That's definitely improved, but at the same time the fighting itself is made slightly more boring than in the HDN games. Bosses and enemies no longer seem to heal themselves or their allies, which gives you less of a reason to prioritize different targets or strategize using more hard-hitting skills. Just gather enough adrenaline, put on your serious face, activate Fairize and whack the crap out of the boss and hope he doesn't deactivate your Fairize before you kill him. In the end, the experience left me with a rather bland taste in my mouth.\n\nYou might be noticing a pattern in my review. I keep using the word "bland" a lot, but that's about all I can say about this game. It's bland. Really bland. Coming in from HDN, I expected funny, quirky characters; I got boring, uninspired people I didn't much care for. I expected an enjoyable plot: I was left with more questions than answers. I expected a bland combat system to be remastered into something better; I got the same one with a few differences here and there. I want to like this game, but having experienced all of this just makes it very hard for me to call it a sufficiently enjoyable experience. Toward the end I just wanted the game to be over so I can move on to other games that I've wanted to play for a while now. Now that I've finished the game once already, I'll do just that. I'm definitely coming back to this later to play NewGame+ and hopefully get a different ending. And when that time comes, I hope I'll see the game in a new light and I might be able to rewrite this review and be more positive about the game itself.\n\nBut until that day, I'll stand by these words and say the game is, at the very least, not worth full price. If you have to get it, get it while it's on sale for at least 50%.","August 12, 2015","false","32.7"," 52 of 83 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","52","83","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zorder/recommended/347830/","zorder","Zorder","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zorder/","2003 products in account","Fairy Fencer F is a nice little mixture of visual novel and RPG style game mechanics and combat. You play as Fang, a guy who ends up acquiring a Fury without realising the responsabilities that come with it. Furies are swords left on the planet long ago after a battle between the Vile God and the Goddess, and each of them has a fairy inside. The fairy inside your Fury, Eryn, explains to you that the Fury is only able to use to those who are destined to fulfill the wish of its fairy. She then explains to you that she wishes you find 100 Furies in order to awake the Goddess. This is where your journey begins.\n\nGameplay overview:\nWe could say that the gameplay of this game is divided into two very different genres. For me, the real meat of the game is the combat, which despite being somewhat repetitive, allows for a lot of different approaches due to the variety of abilities that you can use. Combat is turn based, and in each turn you move your character freely inside a circle and must get within range of the enemy in order to attack. If you get close to this outer circle you can attempt to escape the battle. You’ll be able to to switch between Fencers on the fly, once you have more on your party, but doing so while in combat will end your turn. As you acquire more Furies, you’ll also gain access to more fairies which you can use to increase your stats and get hold of more abilities. Not only that, but acquiring more Furies allow you to start working your way to free the Goddess, or the Vile God if you prefer, and will also enhance your fairy abilities.\n\nThe other part of the game plays pretty much like a kinetic visual novel, in which the player has no actual impact on the conversations and outcomes. That said, I find the dialogue to be rather amusing, if somewhat uninspired. If you’re looking for a deep story, great plot and memorable characters you probably won’t find that here. Still, I find the dialogue rather funny with the ocasional joke here and there, and most of the characters behave like teenagers which gives the game a less serious tone. Also, most of the main story dialogue is fully voice acted, while optional conversations are not.\n\nYou’ll be spending a lot of your time revisiting Zelwinds the main city in the game. Here you can go to different places and talk with random people. You’re also able to buy and sell items, get side missions (kill & fetch quests) and acquire information about the whereabouts of the next Fury. Still, the city feels somewhat lifeless since everything happens through a menu screen. There is no depth to the places and to the different people you find there, they are pretty much there just for the sake of being there, and this made me care less about the actual game world.\n\nThere is also a world map where you can go to various different locations, such as dungeons. There you’ll battle enemies and find varied items. Inside dungeons you can move freely and see enemies wandering, and if you manage to get in close and attack them you’ll trigger an ambush and the battle will start, thus allowing to attack first. Of course, if the enemy gets the drop on you, you’ll be the one getting ambushed. This is probably where I spent most of my time, grinding in dungeons to level up my characters and fairies, doing side quests, collecting items and selling them so that I could afford potions, etc. If you’re not too fond of grinding, you might have a hard time later on with some enemies.\n\nPros:Good looking anime style visuals\nTons of customization and unlockables\nGreat soundtrack - featuring pieces from different musical genres\nFun turn-based combat - with tons of different abilities\nCons:Repetitive dungeons\nLifeless locations & bland NPCs\nFinal verdict:\nIf you’re looking for a memorable story and unique characters you might want to steer away from this, unless you’re a hardcore fan of the Neptunia games and the likes of Idea Factory. The story might be interesting for some people until a certain point, and most of the character reactions are rather predictable. Still, if you’re looking for a solid RPG experience with a very robust turn-based combat system this might be something right up your alley. There are tons of unlockables for you to track down, and if you’re into completing side quests there are always some for you to do. Thus, revisiting old dungeons will always yield some kind of reward.\n\nOverall, I’m enjoying my time with Fairy Fencer F, despite its flaws. If you’re unsure it is worth the full price, grab it on sale. Chances are, if you’ve read this far, you’ll most likely enjoy it.","May 1","true","7.3"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","15","18","0","0"

The Xbox3460 controller can be chosen as the input device in the configuration.\n\nAs far as the game itself goes, I like the following things:\nYou can skip spell/attack animations at the touch of a button.\nBattle system is quick and fast.

Gain WP to learn skills that are prerequisites for better skills.\nWhat I don't like:\nCharacters usually have one modified portrait at most to represent their speech, and the game tries rather comically to make it seem like they're doing things, such as pushing an ally aside by having one picture shove another.\n\nThis is obviously a fairly low budget game. A lot of art assets are re-used, like entire dungeons.\n\nThe story is just the typical JRPG thing. A reluctant hero saves the world to restore the goddess of light so she can defeat the dark Vile God. It would have been nice if the joking scenario Harley claimed was actually the real story instead of this.\n\nThe combo editing system makes little sense. When I go to the menu, I can't change anything even after learning a variety of skills for a character. Either this is a bug or the developers decided to introduce the system too early in the story (eg. it's something advanced I can't actually make use of yet).","August 5, 2015","true","5.7"," 22 of 32 people (69%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","69","22","32","2","2"

You play as a reluctant hero trying to unite the powers of ancient fairy fueled weapons to save the world or at least score some free food along the way.  The combat is an absolute blast with lots of characters to build, weapons to customize and power ups to manage.  The action is fast paced and satisfying, although a bit easy at times and gets repetitive.  The presentation is the "budget" part unfortunately.  The story is told with 2D cartoony cut scenes, with fantastic voice work and some genuinely funny dialog.  However you never really get to explore the towns, country side or world you are trying to save, just the dungeons.  This lack of interaction results in a fantasy world that lacks any weight to it.  I lost interest about half way thru the experience once I grew tired of the combat and party management strong suites of the game.\n\nIf you love JRPG's, especially the combat and character development, then you will enjoy Fairy Fencer.  However the lack of interaction with the story and the out of dungeon world will be a turn off to those looking for a more polished and complete RPG experience.","May 15","true","15.7"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bunnysoldier/recommended/347830/","bunnysoldier","Tattletale","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bunnysoldier/","419 products in account","I'm going to preface this review by stating that it has spoilers for some intricate game mechanics as well as light "plot" spoilers. If you're against spoiling at all, you'll more likely not want to read this, otherwise read-on. There's plenty to talk about.\n\nI think the best way to describe my dissappointment with this game is to talk about all of my gripes with it, starting with grinding. First of all, I'm the type of person who doesn't mind grinding in games, heck I might even say I enjoy it and don't find any trouble in throwing countless hours doing the same repetitive actions when I want to. My troubles are with how the game handles it - poorly.\n\nFor starters, it makes no sense to invest anything in magic. The game has this system named "Shaping Effect", which allows you to change how the dungeon is going to be played. They have lots of effects, and some are really beneficial, like raising EXP gotten, or WP (points gained in battle to upgrade characters' skills and spells), but they all come with negative effects (unless you have an S rank Shaping Effect). These EXP and WP modifiers come with negative effects like raising SP consumption to twice as much, making you take twice as much damage or just straight up Silencing and Sealing you so you cannot make use of spells or skills - since you're going to be grinding a good deal, it makes such Shaping Effects relatively useful. Couple that with how slow it is to select spells in the menus and how many commands you'd have to input, grinding becomes considerably more efficient with just regular attacks. You can literally set up the game to "autobattle" and just pressing X to end encounters within seconds if you're building your characters with Silence and Seal in mind, which trivializes pretty much everything. If you plan on grinding for the DLC areas, you're going to be spending a lot of time battling the same monsters just to get to the DLC and then battle the same monsters reskinned in the DLC area, just considerably more difficult, which feels very lazy and isn't really worth your time or money (wasn't worth mine at the least).\n\nAnd even then, this game is pretty easy even without exploiting any clearly unbalanced mechanics, and it's not really a problem in itself, especially if you're not a very big fan of grinding, Fang (the main character) is just straight up broken, all other character are exchangeable among themselves. That is... until the game 'forces' you to grind ~10+ levels to get to Lv. 40 at a specific point in the story just to get a missable party member - which doesn't even make any sense - as the game does not explain why you have to be Lv. 40 to even get him (mind you, they didn't even reference it in the game, you'd have to look this up online), which is just very frustrating. What's the point of making a game easy if you're just going to force players to grind to attain their coveted 100% completion? Sure thing, you can just wait and unlock him on New Game Plus, but hey, that's a party member, why would I have to wait him to join me if I can just make him join me now?\n\nSpeaking of skills being useless, the game gives you access to a whole load of buffs / debuffs early on for fairly cheap WP and that made me think the game would be pretty awesome, with lots of choices in playstyle and whatnot. Sure, buffs are useful if you want to make use of them, but they're completely unnecessary - now debuffs are pretty much worthless. They'll work on regular mobs, which could be pretty good since they last for quite long, but more often than not do not work on bosses - the kind of encounters you'd actually want to debuff and buff yourself for - which is a major flaw. I mean, what'd be the point of using them in random battles if they're just going to end very quickly and waste your SP that could potentially be used for healing?\n\nThe game also has a wide varity of items in it, and they're mostly pretty nice but since you can just ignore all the SP restoring ones and you'll likely be overlevelled for most of it (enemies will barely be able to touch you) you'll likely not have any use for them (Aside from: Return Wings, the 'escape dungeon' item; Dimensional Clocks, the 'respawn all enemies item'). And when it comes to collectible items, quests can be really annoying. Some of them require you to steal from countless, specific monsters to get an arbritary number of non-droppable (or low rate drop) items, whose only way to acquire otherwise is to hope for them in RNG chests (which you really should not, as stealing is a lot quicker). Not to mention the highest-chance Steal skill has been bugged since the game first released on consoles and was never fixed, which just adds to frustration. Keep in mind the rewards for these quests are often not worth it.\n\nThe story is fairly cliché, although I don't mind it much. I just feel they could have invested and fleshed out more the secondary characters, especially Ethel and Pippin. There just isn't much to connect to, so you end up not caring much about most of them. The story also feels a bit lazy, and will often make you revisit areas due to it. You'll go 'back in time' and they'll be slightly different, having some new monsters and reskins here and there, but it's pretty much the same. It also adds insult to injury that a lot of dungeon layouts might as well be the exact same. I don't mind if you're trying to save costs and reuse some of the graphics, but you know something's wrong when your Final Dungeon is a carbon-copy of another place you've already been to.\n\nAs a conclusion, this isn't the worst JRPG I've played but it's sure as hell dissappointing - I really wanted to like it.\nIt has a lot of things going on for it, like pretty anime graphics and a great soundtrack (which by itself was amazing, but along the game gets oversaturated by repetition), but that alone isn't enough to offset the numerous poor game design choices they've made all throughout it. The game developers really dropped the ball on this. At the end I wasn't enjoying myself and just had to rush it to put the game to a close. I'll also likely not be touching New Game Plus, as I see no point in skimming through the game to see the missable content I've already screwed myself from getting my hands on. This game does not compel you to replay it through.\n\nSuch disappointing game. I wish I could refund it.","December 23, 2015","false","50.6"," 20 of 31 people (65%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","65","20","31","3","0"

So going into Fairy Fencer F, I was expecting a game with a half-arsed story, terrible game mechanics and a million anime girls. Needless to say, I was pleasantly surprised to find out that the Male-to-Female character ratio is, rather than 100% female, closer to 1-1. There is almost an equal number. So the game delivers in providing a diversity of characters. tl;dr FFF character design > HDN\n\nFairy Fencer F is rich with dialogue, dialogue which comes in all forms. So far in fact, that as you collect 'furies' throughout the game and the corresponding fairies to each fury that are displayed in your inventory, each will have something to say on every topic in the game, it's endless fun to sit and browse through your fairies and learn each fairy's individual thoughts and point of view. The comedic value of the game is significant, I was provided with a significant portion of laughter. There are feels, and the soundtrack matches the artwork and tone of the game almost spot on.\n\nA significant flaw in FFF is the difficulty level, this game is far too easy, it doesn't take a lot of skill to play, which is fine for the most part with JRPGs since they are mostly story-driven (You only have to look at final fantasy to see that). However, it wouldn't hurt to throw in an actual challenge once in a while.\n\nAll in all the game was pretty good, I grew attached to some of the characters, I was pleasantly surprised by FFF, I was going into this game expecting to be utterly disappointed by a subpar game, drenched in 'waifus'. HOWEVER, as was made clear in my review, this game was far from that.\n\nGameplay - 7.5/10\nCharacter design / development - 8/10\nStory - 8/10\nSoundtrack - 9/10\nArtwork - 9.5/10\n\nRoom for improvement, but a fantastic game!","August 26, 2015","true","43.6"," 14 of 21 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","14","21","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/juicysupport/recommended/347830/","juicysupport","Yuki","http://steamcommunity.com/id/juicysupport/","500 products in account","Gameplay:Fairy Fencer F is just like HyperDimension Neptunia a jRPG. It takes alot of inspiration from Neptunia if it goes to the character design and graphic design, also the most gameplay mechanics reminds on it. Never the less it also has some own ideas like "world shaping ( which lets you give some advantages / disadvantages to dungeons, like an increased exp rate ). But overall the actual compat stays pretty basic. Some nice ideas here and there but nothing, that you could call completely "new". Badly it also lacks in explaining those new gameplay mechanics. Which results in that you either find it out by accident how things work OR you do not get it at all. As I said before a basic combat system that lacks in good explanation for newcomers.\n\nStory:Let's get over to the story part. In comparison to Neptunia this game does not has a humor interms of "references". The humor of this game stays more like, "making fun of other characters". And the story-line is way more serious than in Neptunia. ... Some of you might noticed that I compare it alot to Neptunia at this part, well yeah. It takes alot of it inspiration and art from Neptunia so I need to compare those 2 games. But to get back to the topic. I'd really love to recommend the game to you and say something like "decent combat and an amazing and fun story", but this game does not make it so easy for me... Basically, the story of the game has a pretty obvious plot hole.\nWhile the campaign you are going to travel back in time to prevent one of your allies to die. You see her with a spear through her body. But she still is able to talk. Basically, you are nothing else doing than travelling back in time to stretch the playing time, even though there is no need to travel back in time. YOU have a special item which can basically heal ANY wound. Why don't they use it to heal her? No, they do not use it. Just streatch the game by about 50% and make it repetetive and boring.\n\nConclusion:Oh boy, the longer my review gets, the more negative i get, even though I do not mean it that way. It is an ok game. The combat is fun because of its new gameplay mechanics, the humor and the story plot extend it nicely. But there is still this little concern with the plot hole. Basically if you can overlook this little plot hole and you want a basic jRPG with a good humor and still serious story then I can recommend it to you. Otherwise better skip it...\n\nRating: 7/10","September 3, 2015","true","55.8"," 15 of 23 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","15","23","0","6"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ponxha/recommended/347830/","ponxha","Ponxha","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ponxha/","2027 products in account","TL;DR: Mixed feelings about this game. Enjoyable characters and some mechanics make it interesting and worthwhile but a lot of other aspects are flawed.\n\nStory:\nFairly generic, guy finds sword, has to save the world (revive the goddess, greater good) while fighting evil organization that wants to reshape the world to its needs (revive the evil god, for personal gains). The plot twists aren't great but still manage to keep the story going.\n\nA first playthrough without grinding too much should take you around 20-25 hours, which is fairly decent.\n\nThe story/interactions are displayed in a visual novel form, same as Neptunia games, so it involves a lot of reading.\nThankfully the characters are quite fun, starting with the lazy anti-hero main character, making the dialogues entertaining (and there's a lot of it).\n\nThe main goal during the story is to acquire Furies to free the goddess. Each Fury gives you some additional main stats and bonuses (power, xp, protection, regen...). A bit later they also get world-shaping modifiers which allow you to alter dungeons (new and old). Those changes vary from bonus attack/defense to increased rewards or ennemies change, but almost every modifier also has a penalty: a +10% physical attack bonus will have a -10% magical attack penalty for instance.\n\nCombat system:\nIf you're familiar with Neptunia combat system it's quite similar: Basic attacks/Skills/Magic, plus a Fairize mode (a tension gauge fills during battle and then lets you transform in a more powerful version of yourself and gives you access to 1-2 utlimate attack) and an additional skill for each character.\n\nThe basic attacks use a combo system, the more you advance in the game the more consecutive attacks you'll do. It's a very important aspect especially early on. You can chose to create fancy combo with aerial attacks or just chain your most powerful ones, it won't change much, which is sad.\n\nWhile it seems good on paper you probably won't use everything in battle. The game is quite easy and with Fury world-shaping you'll adjust your playstyle to a more efficient way.\n\nEquipment:\nYour weapon is your main Fury, and you can't change it, only upgrade it using WP rewarded by defeating enemies, which leaves you with only 2 slots of equipment: armor and ring. It's not much, and when you consider the stat increases they provide it's even less.\n\nUpgrading your weapon will give your more stats, combo, Fairize power, range, and skills. So it'll cost you a lot of WP to fully upgrade all your characters.\n\nArmor and ring represent about 10-15% of your total stats, maybe more at the beginning but it kinda kills the need to upgrade often or to get the best armor which will give you 10% more than the previous best on the 10% total stats of your character... so maybe hours of farming for a 1% stat increase, great.\n\nYou are also able to "equip" a secondary Fury, giving you bonus stats and some other ability boosts. Those equipped Furies will level up , unlocking more boosts and increasing your stats even more.\n\nThe other way to improve your characters stats is to complete challenges. Each one has a wide variety of challenges: control for X minutes, kill X enemies, attack X times... It's nice until you realize it's impossible to complete unless you spend hundred of hours grinding. So by playing normally you'll have a few bonus stats on the characters you use most, but nowhere near their full potential.\n\nAnd if you bought the DLC increasing the maximum level to 999, well there's no new gear, only what you get by leveling up.\n\nSidequests/occupations:\nThe basic sidequests system is ranked quests: in the town bar you'll be able to pick basic kill/fetch quests depending on your rank. After completing a certain number of quests at your current rank you'll have access to a unique quest to increase your rank, two of those quests can take up to a few hours to complete while the others take a few minutes. But at least it's totally optional, I can't think of any worthwhile reward except an achievement for achievement Rank S  and 1 rank B quest in NG+ for a Fury\n\nThe game being based on Furies, you'll find some quests telling you where to find some Furies (16 of them) in previously visited dungeons. Those quests have 2 bad aspects: the "previously visited dungeons" aspect, and the fact that they appear for a limited time, some right after you enter a dungeon but before finishing it (easy to miss if you don't leave a dungeon right from the start), and some right after finishing a dungeon (hard to miss). If you miss one, you'll have to get it in the next playthrough, and managing to do all 16 in the same playthrough rewards you with a bonus character.\n\nThere's also a bonus dungeon, a tower which gains 1 floor for each of your Fury involved in world-shaping, up to 40 floors. The tower rewards you with a total of 5 Furies, and some items.\n\nIn the Shop you'll have access to the Synthesis system, which is basically crafting. You'll need it for your Fury collection and quest rank but other than that it's not particularly useful, armors and items in the shop are enough and except early in the game you'll never lack money to buy your items instead of using the synthesis system.\n\n\nNG+:\nSince the game has 3 endings (more like 3 variations on the last 5 dialogues), you can load your clear data from the previous playthrough to start again keeping your levels/gear/furies/quest rank.\n\nThere's absolutely 0 difficulty in NG+, enemies are still the same level as before and the story is the same (except for the endings). So it's really to do stuff you missed and what you didn't have access to before: bonus characters, Furies (1 Fury is only in NG+, 1 Fury is obtained in 2 playthrough, and any of the 16 sidequests), the tower (you need all Furies for the last floor, so NG+ is mandatory for that)\n\nSo it's mostly for completionists.\n\nDLCs:\nIt's either good or bad depending on your point of view: they're totally optional (and fairly useless).\n\nThe "Surpass your limits" DLC will give you eveything content related: 3 more maps (copies of already existing maps with high level enemies), max lvl of 999, and 40 more floors in the tower (high level fights). Since there's no new gear/items/furies it's really only if you want more fights, and mostly more grind. It'll help you with the main game though: faster leveling (the first lvl100 map can be done before being 100), access to some high elemental stones (useful for the quest rank) and consumable items.\n\nThe Additional Fairy Pack gives you 8 more Furies with very good stats equivalent to the best S rank Furies. But they can't be used for world-shaping.  Still pretty good, and a bit OP.\n\nThe 4 other DLCs are armors and cosmetic items, not particularly useful. Armors/rings are not particularly powerful compared to what you can obtain in the game, you'll just have a lot of defense making you invulnerable early in the game. But considering my previous point on gear, it's not really worth it on the long term.\n\nI probably forgot some other points  but it's already quite lenghty so:\n\nConclusion:\nI enjoyed my first playthrough, mostly thanks to the characters. The game has some good ideas and potential with the Furies, world-shaping, synthesis, linked combos, attack types... but it falls short in everything: moving every Fury one by one when you use world-shaping in dungeons, fairly useless synthesis, low incentive to create good combos (stack powerful attacks). And if you want to see/do everything the game has to offer, it's quite grindy.\n\nSo basically I'd recommend it as long as you don't plan on going too deeply into it. For around $8 on sale it's worth the entertaining 20h you'll get out of it.\n\n6.5/10","January 11","true","42.4"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","7","8","0","0"

A lot of them are simply unfair towards the player by having tons of hp and dealing more than enough damage to corner you in a heal-or-die combat style which sooner or later leads to the death of your party. You can simply overcome the difficulty of these combats by leveling just one or two levels but bosses still stay tanky, they just deal less damage. What differs bossfights from each other is the amount of HP each boss has.The last dungeon of the game literally made me spam just two buttons because even if bosses dealt ridiculously low amount of damage, they were too tanky and it took way too much time for each one to kill it. It was really dissapointing way to finish a gameplay i really enjoyed.\n-Questing system is boring and feels useless\n-Dungeons might be considered as empty\n\nSummaryDespite of the flaws i mentioned, Fairy Fencer F is a great game. I really enjoyed these 20 hours i put into finishing it and i would love to spend more time with it. I am not dissapointed with it yet i feel like it could be slightly better. I totally recommend this game for everyone who enjoyed any of Hyperdimension Neptunias, because it is pretty much the same game, just a lot better.\n\n8/10","August 17, 2015","true","26.1"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","11","16","0","0"

You breathe a sigh of relief\nas you close your eyes on the couch, with the\nerratic weather outside  shifting from rainy to\nsunny, as if in sync with Summer-Rain's own\nname and temperament. You glance over to your\nphone and thumb through, seeing Mrs. Novocaine's\nmessage from the time of Melody's Escape.\n\nWondering why she wanted to talk suddenly, you\nopen and see a long message about how so much\nhas changed for her and she wishes to try to\nreconnect with you, and that she might have made\na terrible mistake. You turn off your phone's screen,\ndisgusted. Booting up your computer, something\ngreets you on the store page with petticoats,anime\nand swords.\n\nFAIRY FENCER F.\n\nRaising an eyebrow, you click 'buy'. Minutes later,\nyou're in a land of sword-and-sorcery with a vague\nhint of technology, and as you progress through the\nsurprisingly riveting and engaging story, guides and\nwalkthroughs describe how Fairy Fencer F has links\nto the Hyperdimension Neptunia games.\n\nThe story, in all its bright technicolor anime glory,\nis more than serviceable, with a healthy selection of\nwaifus who serve as weapon upgrades (!), so much\nso that you find yourself lost in the semi-open world\nas well. You explore the world as the selfish slacker\nFang, 'duped' to become a Fencer, a warrior using\nwaifu-weapons, such as his Fairy-weapon-waifu Eryn.\n\nAlong the way, you meet the stunning, highbrow,\ngothic-lolita Tiara, another Fencer who is manipulative,\ncunning and a closet sadomasochist, together with the\nbuxom Harley and the mysterious, mecha-commanding\nGaldo. The quest is a simple one where the story takes\nunexpected turns- the Fairies need to be collected and\ntheir power harnessed to reawake a Goddess chained\nafter an apocalyptic battle, but things might be more\nthan they seem.\n\nYou fall asleep as you pull out the sixth Fairy sword\nfrom the Goddess's body in the underground vault,\nbefore waking up to what you realize is your head\non two soft thighs and the strong scent of\nstrawberries.\n\n"...Summer... I can explain..." You stir, before seeing\nSummer-Rain's perfume bottle on the table in front\nof you. You stop dead in your sentence, knowing\nthat she doesn't make it a point to show off things\nlike Tiara or Ms. Novoc-\n\n"Morning." The soft voice says while you turn in her\nlap, the burnished afterscent of cigarrettes being\nmasked by the strawberry perfume. Your face turns\ninto one of intense indignation. "Novocaine."\n\n"Starboy. I... We need to talk."\n\n"YOU need to talk, but not me." You are about to\nleap out, but at that instant, Summer-Rain walks in\nthe living room, busy with a box of cake and a tub\nof ice cream to celebrate the end of the term. Your\nblood runs cold, and Mrs. Novocaine looks livid.\n\nSummer-Rain stares at the both of you, having\ndropped everything. "...Starboy....?!" Summer-Rain\nbegins, her lip shaking and her eyes filling with tears.\n\n"Summer...! I was playing Fairy Fencer F, and- and-\nI can explain!" Mrs. Novocaine looks at the both of\nyou before she grabs your arm, snuggling up to you\nand giving Summer-Rain a ♥♥♥♥♥y look. "Yes...! DO\nexplain, hun!" Your blood turns to block ice when\nyou hear the pet name that Ms. Novocaine used to\ncall you.\n\n"You have ten seconds to explain yourself!"\nSummer-Rain demands, shaking. You realize the\nsituation is delicate, especially after all that has\ntranspired these last few days. Novocaine wanting\nyou back. Summer-Rain by your side. The universe\nis still turning somehow, despite these two living\nGoddesses vying for power over you and your\nheart. Your two Fairies.\n\n"I was playing Fairy Fencer F and fell asleep from\nthe exhaustion of the exams when I woke up to\nfind my head in Ms.- I mean Mrs. - Novocaine's\nlap, and I was about to tell her to get out when\nyou came in!" You blubber, as Summer-Rain burns\nholes through you with her death stare.\n\n"No hun! Didn't you enjoy our little reunion after\nall this time...?! Didn't you like playing with-"\n\nSummer-Rain screamed then, and screamed all\nkinds of profanities that you never thought she,\nor any other woman would even utter. All this\nvitriol and bile she had was built up over the\nyears, and now she was letting Mrs. Novocaine\nreally have it. Mrs. Novocaine fell silent and\nwhen it was finally over, she left without a word,\nclicking the door shut behind her, leaving both\nyou and Summer-Rain looking at each other in\nstunned silence.\n\n"I thought you'd never believe me..." You say,\nbreaking the silence after finally meeting her\neyes. Both of you are close to crying, realizing\nhow much you truly love one another.\n\n"I'm not her, Starboy." She says, reminding\nyou of how Ms. Novocaine always gave you\ntrouble when it came to faith. "Ice cream's\nmelting. Gimme some help-" You ignore\nSummer-Rain's deadpan way of trying to gloss\nover the situation and rush to give her a hug.\n\n"I love you, Summer." You whisper. She hugs\nyou back tighter, not wanting to let go.\n\n"I know, Starboy. I know."\n\nFAIRY FENCER F.\n\n\n","February 1","true","7.0"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","67","10","15","7","1"

Its one of many modern Jrpgs that focuses more on style than substance. The two minute long video on the store page is testament to this. Its not a game for everybody, but those who like this sort of thing will probably enjoy Fairy Fencer F.\n\nHere's a pro/con list of some things I noticed while playing the game.\n\nPro:\n-The battle system can be very flashy and exciting\n-There is lots in the way of equipment, items to keep you scouring the game\n-The female characters are pretty hot (Yes its a video game but the characters adequetly represent the image of beauty by which they were designed)\n\nCon:\n-The dialogue is terrible. Its just bad. I suppose you might enjoy it if you're a diehard anime fan or teenager. But as someone who prefers dialgue that is both well-written and engaging I found this to be unbearable.\n-The main character is on-par with the most annoying characters in Jrpg history (right up there with Squall and Tidus)\n-There is little in the way of exploration or engaging interaction with the world. You pick an area, go into a dungeon, deal with random cutscenes filled with nonsequitor dialogue then head back to the hub screen. There are no towns, no npcs living in the world, no depth or quirkiness to establish the world as anything more than the 2D backdrop for all the fluff and nonsense this game calls a story.\n\nI'd keep playing this game if I had nothing else to play ONLY because the combat can be mildly enjoyable in short bursts. It is ABSOLUTELY not worth the retail price. Even at 70% off (8.99) I'm hesitant to recomment a purchase. I'd say get this ONLY if you're a wild fan of the waifu anime girls, 14 years old, and struggle getting into games with deep and engaging plotlines.","January 31","false","2.0"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","64","9","14","2","0"

The classic hero line ups ( hotheaded boy, cute girl, geek girl etc ) and just that lighthearted playstyle that puts a smile on your face.\n\nThe music in this game shocked me also, I really loved the music in this game!..and not just the battle music too or the transform epic rock music thats voiced. but the back ground music of the game areas have a really good sound too and some voiced in japanese. really makes you enjoy just walking around or just grinding more.\n\nThe story of the game overall is ok, not amazing in truth. I did play it in English so maybe it did not get its full Japanese justice to the story as it was intended, and the game is not very long. But it has very good endgame content and choices/secret options in the game that changes the whole story ( such as in a second playthrough you get a playable guy I never got in first playthrough etc ) so there is replayablity.\n\nI would 100% recommend this game to any JRPG fan or anime fan overall.

You will find not everyone who tries has the ability to wield these relics. It is only those who are worthy of them that can pull them free. Fencers wield these weapons with the assistance of the fairy that resides within the weapon. For once, you are not really saving the world. At the beginning, there really is no peril that a hero/heroine must raise to defeat. In fact, the protagonist of this game isn’t even really a hero at all.\n\nGameplay\nThe game is a mixture of a visual novel and an action role-playing game. The story is driven by discussions the playable characters hold as well as their interactions with the NPCs. During the discussions, a static image of the characters is on screen. To emphasize which character is doing the talking, that particular character will have an animated mouth. Emotions are conveyed through a mixture of symbols and facial expressions. If the characters are having a story based discussion, it will be fully voice acted. If it is a random conversation, it will generally be just text on the screen. This works quite well although I do prefer the voiced sections over the just text sections.\n\nWhen in town you simply select between the various options and you enter into the related screen. You do not need to walk to the item shop or inn when you arrive at the town. This is handy because it saves you from having to remember where each place is and having to run back and forth between them constantly, but I still prefer to have explore-able towns. Dungeons are thankfully free to explore when you get to them. The world map is simple to navigate, it shows places you have already opened and explored. It also conveniently has your next destination(s) flagged on the map as well as where any events or sub-events may be taking place.\n\nDungeons are where you are going to spend most of your time (outside of dialogues between characters). You are free to roam around as you please. Monsters can be seen wandering around and you have the option to fight them or attempt to avoid them. If you choose to fight them, you can attempt to get a preemptive strike by swinging your weapon right before the battle screen is triggered. If successful, all your characters will get a chance to strike the enemy first. If you fail or if the enemy sneaks up on you, you will be the one ambushed giving the enemies the chance to strike first. Just walking into an enemy will put your characters and enemies in that standard cue to fight. The fight cue is always displayed and lets you know who will get their turn next. When you are controlling a character in combat, you have a movement circle. You can move anywhere in that circle before you take your action. Once you take your action, your turn ends and the next in cue gets to take theirs. Since each weapon type and ability has its own range and effective arcs, it makes for a nice variety when playing.\n\nThe game has a lot of customization options available to you. While you can’t change your weapon, you can reconfigure it so it changes into a different type of weapon during combat. You are given free choice of what armor and accessories you want to wear as well as your secondary fairy. To make up for the fact you can’t change your weapon, you are given weapon points after battles. These can be spent on how you want to customize the weapon and your related weapon abilities. If you prefer to do a lot of simple physical attacks, that is great. You can set yourself up that way. Do you prefer getting really high combo scores? Well you can buy new combos too. There are a ton of customizations options and luckily you are not locked into your decisions as taking one of the ability does not preclude you from taking a different one later. With enough grinding, you can max out everything for every character.\n\nFairies make this game more interesting. They do that in three ways.  The first is the fact that when your Tension gauge fills (fills when you do damage or takes damage, but reduces when you miss or heal yourself), you gain the ability to merge with your weapon’s fairy and become much more powerful. Another way the fairies are interesting is that you can acquire new ones as you play. While you can never swap out your main fairy (fused to your weapon) you can swap out your secondary fairy. You can customize the abilities of the secondary fairy to some degree as well. When you acquire a new one, if you equip it, it will level up and gain new abilities. You can also merge it with one of the sealed weapons found impaling the fallen God and Goddess that I mentioned earlier. By merging it, you gain new abilities for the secondary fairy. The third way they are interesting is the fact that you can stick a fairy imbued weapon into the ground to “shape the world” using the shaping abilities of the fairy. This changes up how dungeons work as well as adds extra levels to a tower in the game. By sticking the shaping weapon into the ground, you will get positive and negative effects that will change how the dungeon will play out. You may get extra experience while doing the dungeon, but you will take more damage from magical attacks. It might even change the enemies in the dungeon making it feel a little different when you go through it.\n\nThe story and characters in this game diverge a little from the standard clichés for this type of game as well. Instead of being a band of heroic figures rallying to save the world, you have a band of misfits each doing it for their own personal and selfish reasons. The protagonist of the game doesn’t even want to do it. He just pulled a sword out of the ground because someone told him it would grant him any wish he could think of. All he wanted to wish for was a nice meal. He accidentally became linked to the fairy in the sword who then forced him to go on the quest because she has amnesia and wants the other fairies to help her remember her past. Another Fencer is out for her own personal gains and is really full of herself. Another is just studying fairies… you get the idea. None of them are actually real heroes! That makes this game much more fun than the cliché, “let’s save the world from evil” shticks of other RPG games.\n\nOverall, it’s another enjoyable Idea Factory game. If you like the story telling, humour and fan service found in their other games, such as the Hyperdimention Neptunia series, you will likely enjoy Fairy Fencer F as well. If you are looking for a fun dungeon crawler style RPG that has zany characters, by all means give Fairy Fencer F a go.\n\nPros:It’s long and made longer by having to continue the game in New Game Plus to actually beat the game fully\nA lot of customization options including cosmetic changes to the characters\nFun characters that all feel like they do have their own personality. Even the NPCs don’t feel bland or generic\nGood use of music\nFrom the drawn visuals of the characters in the discussion scenes to the models used in the dungeons, the game looks good\nNot the typical save the world from the bad guy story\nEach dungeon feels unique, it isn’t just the same basic enemies and layout rehashed every time\n\nCons:\n\nDLC make you over-powered if activated too early which might ruin the fun and challenge\nProtagonist makes it hard for a person on a diet.

If you're a fan of J-RPGs and romance anime, you'll surely love this game. TL;DR down below.\n\nThroughout the entire game, you are given a good amount of characters to choose from with more in the later parts of the game. As you progress further into the story, a bit of farming may be needed as enemies become more and more tough to deal with, but as a J-RPG it was already expected. The mechanics of the game maybe a bit tacky and confusing at first, but eventually it becomes easier as you continue to play.\n\nNow, the story was probably one of the best stories I've ever experienced in video games. Each part of the dialogue does its job well, when you need to be happy or laugh, you are met with corny jokes and ridiculous events, but when you need to feel for the characters in the game, you will without a doubt feel the sadness they show. Honestly, as you continue playing the story, you will become immersed and will develop a love for each and every character you play as. Hell, maybe you'll love some characters who you don't even play as.\n\nNext, the replayability potential is high as there are four different routes you may choose from and because there is also a new game+ type system where your stats from your previous run will be brought over to your next run and don't worry, the enemies won't get easy because of this.\n\nFinally, if you actually read all the way here, I give my thanks for doing so and for considering to buy this beautiful, funny and amazing game. I was truly surprised by how much I loved playing this game and regretted for not getting it sooner. As a gamer, I know that some people are out here to buy only one game and that there are many games to choose from. Believe me, I had high doubts when I first bought it since I was entirely new to the J-RPG genre in general. But, this game has been a blast to play through and I wish more people could experience it. Idea Factory truly have outdone themselves with this game.\n\nAs it stands, I have finished this game and no longer have a purpose to play it once more. Not having a reason to see my favorite characters again, truly made me sad. But, their sequel is coming and I hope it will live up to its predecessor.\nI, as an avid gamer, am looking forward to the next sequel Idea Factory is releasing and hope to see my favorite characters once more.\n\ntl;dr: Beautiful, amazing and funny.

The story was a truly wonderful experience.\n\nThe combat aspect in this game is rather challenging if you didn't use the weapons/armor provided by the DLC ( and if you waste your money on cosmetics and not potions or equipment, like i did )\nBut in most dungeons you will end up spamming basic attacks and heals, at least when fighting against low-tier mobs.\nThe Boss fights were challenging most of the time and made me think of actually using some sort of strategy and forced me to even prepare for those battles beforehand.\n\nThe visuals in this game are what you would expect from a decent JRPG so nothing bad or special to comment on that.\n\nAnd the last thing to comment on was the character design and development. No one of the characters seemed boring and they each contributed to the story in their own way, which i liked. There weren't any useless party members that you just ignored and never made use of.\n\nOverall this game was a really pleasant experience and I will definitely try to complete the two other endings.\n","February 24","true","18.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

I played this game for only 1.5 hours - and I got bored to death already! ^^ Obviously, Anime fans seem to like it. And I can see why. But to me, what I saw so far was not very appealing. Dialogue is presented in visual novel style, with solid voice actors. What I disliked about it is how absolutely not serious it is. They try to be funny all the time. They try to be cute. And it has this childish/family friendly touch. This is just not what I want from a RPG. I am not an Anime fan, but I am open to it. There were a few Animes I enjoyed. But I like the more serious ones. Not the cute ones. The story might have been interesting to me, but I just don't like how it is presented in this game. The gameplay doesn't seem to be very special. Standard JRPG turn-based combat, as far as I can tell. It's not bad, but it's also not enough to keep me playing despite the mentioned things I dislike about the game. So while I can see that it's probably a nice game for others, it's just not for me. Even after this short amount of time, I am pretty sure I won't play any more of it.\n\nAnd I am completely aware, that I will most likely get downvoted like crazy here. ^^ But that's ok. The review should reflect my personal opinion. And my opinion is that I just don't enjoy the game. And I am sure there are people out there who would feel the same. So that's why I have to give it a thumbs down. I am sure the game can stand one thumb down, with otherwise 93% positive reviews. ;)","December 23, 2015","false","6.0"," 21 of 38 people (55%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","55","21","38","2","0"

If you want to see the short verison just scroll down a bit. Also some begginer's tip at the end ;)\n\nI try to be as non-emotional as I can when I write these things (I'm a heartless person don't judge pls), but this game is different .... (in a good way)\n\nOk so the basic non emotional stuff:\n(INCLUDE SOME TINY SPOILERS but REALLY tiny ones I swear :) )\n\nPositives:\n\n+ I especially liked the the storyline, even though some parts were expectable/predictable (or partly expectable) it didn't make me hate the story or be like: I knew that, so this, and this, and this will happen so why should I finish the game... I just watch the ending annnnd yes as expected.. There is no spoon (*bad jokes are bad*)\n+ Fighting animations and system are both on point (obviously fanservice is there)\n+ Loveable characters (except Galdo and Pipin.... I hate them so much), voice acting (yes the English one aswell) and great dialogs with some humor in it :D\n+ Not too hard fighting to hate the game for being difficult, but enough hard to don't put it down for being too easy (boss fight are pretty balanced aswell)\n+ Clever ideas in the game ( You will see I won't  spoil it to you... :) )\n\nNeutral:\n\n~ Fanservice maybe ... (Actually I don't like fanservice but this my opinion, everyone have his/her own right to love or hate things so that's why I have put it here)\n~ Similar fights, what I mean that there's not very much variety in the fights, but I still loved it so its kinda bad and good\n\nNegatives:\n\n- Soooooo much grinding\n\nso\n\nmuch\n\ngrinding\n\n- You have to replay the game 2 more times if you want to see all the endings (Which I really don't bother I liked this game I'll give it another shot :) )\n- Achievment Struggle (I will explain later)\n- Lola's greedines, but also she is my spirit animal. I looooooooove money <3 (Which brings us back to the grinding problem)\n- Jumping system (the feeling when you have to kill the same enemies 10x more, because you missed a jump and have to use more items therefor you have to spend more money what you should give to Lola to get more quests, and so on, and so on .....*unrepeatable*.... there are still parts where I couldn't get cause the jumping)\n\nEDIT:\n\nYeah I said I tried to be as non-emotial as I could....  I failed as I see\n\nEmotional part:\n\nAh where should I start..\n\nAt first I thought: "This will be a basic like RPG storyline nothing to be so amazed about" but luckily I was wrong and I can totally understand that ~92% positive rating. The charatcers were the basics: The funny one, The hero, The need to be saved one, etc.. but they something plus which I can't put in words. The story as I mentioned were great but I won't pin-point it out because that would be a spoiler and rule #1 no big spoilers in reviews ;) It stars as you would expect to start but It becomes better turst me. So just wait and see ;)\n\nAs I played this game I never felt like I should put this down. Something always moved me to go back and fight and play this game.There were some "WTF?! Are you serious?!" moments in both meanings and some "Oh ffs" in both meanings aswell :D . Maybe these were the ones that kept me moving, because maybe I couldn't belive they were seriously about that. But as I played more and more I eventually finished this game (for once atleast) and I feel sad.... There's no more... It's over... Althought the ending is great, It's still over. It was a great journey I want to relive it again like I played it for the first time.\n\nYou can ask my friends, 90% of it (who know me well) will say that I'm not that emotional type of guy who cry on every death or etc. I'm the exact opposite, you can almost say I'm dead inside emotionally, but this game made me "feel" on some points...( Not like crying or etc. , but you can figure out what I mean. )\n\nI COULD write more stuff like this, but I WON'T it would take a novel and you are here a review. (And it would get akward... :D )\n\nIn short:\nGreat game, great story, great characters and DEFIENETLY worth the money (DLC not necessary to the game it just plus items and dungeon, but you won't get more in the story if you don't buy them) 9/10 because of the small bugs and problems, but one of the best games I played so far. Love it <3 CAN'T WAIT TO SEE THE NEW GAME COMING OUT\n\nBEGINNER'S GUIDE:\n1. When you get a character use your points for the LEARNING skill. Trust me I had to struggle without it AND it will help alot in the late game. No spoilers :)\n2. Upgrade your teammates aswell in both skills and items (SPOILER  Expect Lord Sherman, trust me... Ok No more spoilers\n3. I suggest to you to focus on the main storyline, because you can acidentally trigger an alternative ending. (Like I did -.-+ )\nYou can find further help HERE , but it includes some spoilers (and also an achievement guide) , so finish the game first atleast once ;)\n4. The cards: I like them but I don't suggest to go further then Level 2 in the badges, only IF you especially love one character. The Foil cards: yeahhh now thats a different story..... In overall they cost 12 or more dollars and the game cost app. the same. If you REALLY REALLY intend to get it or you just really liek that character I won't stop you but you won't get you mony back. Backgrounds: Simple clean, great. If you hit the jackpot you get a 3 dollar background which is the best in my opinion and also MONEYYYY $$$$$, Emote icons: Well you decide\nMore info HERE[www.steamcardexchange.net]\n\nWell that's it folks :) If you read it through I would appreciate a rating cause this is my very first long review :)\n\nSPECIAL THANKS:\nZozo_500 for gifting me this great game as a christmas present :) You da best :)","January 14","true","40.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Harley365/recommended/347830/","Harley365","Harley365","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Harley365/","213 products in account","Conceptually, Fairy Fencer F would seem to be a return to the roots of the JRPG genre: a traditionally-styled game with a distinctly Japanese story and aesthetic. Consider the alliteration in Fairy Fencer F’s title, which calls Final Fantasy to mind, or the game’s development team, which includes composer Nobuo Uematsu and artist Yoshitaka Amano, both of Final Fantasy fame. How unfortunate, then, that Fairy Fencer F is no glorious return to the heyday of the JRPG, but rather a strange, distorted effort, terrifically fun in bursts but plagued by unfortunate technical issues.\n\nFairy Fencer F is the story of young warrior Fang and his fairy partner, Eryn. Fang's excessively cynical and derogatory attitude is likely to grate within mere minutes of starting the game, in which he constantly complains about his new path in life. You see, as the game begins, Fang is told by a shopkeeper that if he is capable of pulling out a strange sword embedded in a rock, he will be granted any wish he desires. All he wants is tasty food (a running obsession that becomes unfunny almost instantly), but, upon yanking out the sword, he is greeted by semi-amnesiac Eryn, told he is a legendary fencer, and asked to free the world's Goddess from her stasis by finding and using Furies, fairies trapped in mythical weapons. Fang’s annoyance at having such a burden suddenly dropped on him is understandable, but his continued whininess and apathy is exceptionally irksome. Eryn is more likeable, though the moment another female appears on the scene she goes into (similarly unfunny) jealous-possessive-angry mode.\n\nFairy Fencer F's least irritating character.\nI soon met Tiara, a stuck-up, bratty fencer who harbors a genre-standard terrible secret. She also doubles as an exposition machine, teaching you about the plane beyond reality where the Goddess and evil deity are sealed and giving you a free inn to recover at--when she's not being bossy and condescending. Notice a theme here? The majority of Fairy Fencer F's cast was ripped straight from the pages of Anime Character Tropes You Can Implement Easily. Suffice to say, it takes a fair amount of time before a truly likeable character joins the troupe. Certain party members become more tolerable as time goes on, but it's hard to shake those awful first impressions.\n\nLayers of Fear Announcement Trailer\nCheck out this new psychedelic horror game from the Polish developer Bloober Team.\nSaddled with a party of people I would have liked to punch in the face given the opportunity, I ventured out into the exploration portion of Fairy Fencer F. Much to my relief, exploration and combat are a fair bit more energizing than watching barely-animated character cutouts complain to each other. Combat is turn-based with positioning elements: You and your enemies move around a small field and trade blows with each other, launching area-of-effect spells and utilizing strategic positioning to your advantage. The basics aren't tough to grasp, and as you earn more weapon points in battle, you can customize your stat boosts and add multi-hitting combo capabilities to your characters' strikes.\n\nThis kind of cringe-worthy dialogue is par for the course.\nThe majority of Fairy Fencer F's cast was ripped straight from the pages of Anime Character Tropes You Can Implement Easily.\nA neat addition to the formula is the tension gauge: as characters attack and use skills, their tension increases and multiplies the damage they deal. Once tension reaches a certain point, characters can "fairize," transforming into quasi-robot-armored fighters with access to special, super-damaging techniques. However, playing overly defensively--using lots of healing items and spells, retreating from enemies, running away from battle--reduces the tension, and if it dips below a certain point, your combat efficacy will suffer. It's a neat system that makes the combat considerably more engaging. It's quite fast-paced, as well--the handy L2 button allows you to skip a lot of long-winded combat animations.\n\nYou can find new dungeons to explore at set points in the story, where you'll find some Furies to collect (along with the fairies that inhabit them and/or possibly another fencer). Once you've got a Fury/fairy combo, you can summon the pair to remove one of the binding blades sealing the Goddess and the Vile God. Doing so upgrades the abilities of the fairy, who can then either be assigned to one of your party members or to a dungeon via a process called "world shaping." While the stat bonuses fairies can provide to party members are nothing to be sneezed at (and they also level up through combat), world shaping is particularly cool: by assigning a fairy to a dungeon, you also get persistent effects throughout that dungeon, i.e. an experience boost when defeating enemies. This helps make sub-questing less of an out-and-out grind, as it helps tailor some dungeon settings to your liking. The dungeon romping itself is also more engaging than developer Compile Heart's previous endeavors, with multi-level layouts and traps.\n\nThis still frame is only a little slower than the game's average frame rate.\nAs much as I enjoyed the fundamental combat and dungeon-crawling, it was sometimes difficult for me to enjoy them. In many of the dungeons, Fairy Fencer F suffers from an atrocious and varying framerate, frequently dipping into the sub-20 frames-per-second range. Compile Heart games tend to suffer from this problem, even though the visuals aren't terribly complex, but Fairy Fencer F is particularly awful, to the point where dungeon crawls can lead to motion sickness and headaches.\n\nThe irritating cast and miserable framerate dips aside, you must also contend with sudden difficulty spikes, recycled environments, and an inconsistent art style. Even the much-touted Yoshitaka Amano and Nobuo Uematsu’s contributions are disappointing. Amano's contributions are a handful of art concepts, while Uematsu's--or more specifically, Uematsu's team of musicians, the Earthbound Papas’--music is uneven; some tracks are absolutely fantastic, while others are entirely unmemorable. Yet there are glimpses of a game that could have been consistently entertaining: combat, when it's not running like a slideshow, is satisfying; there's a lot of customization available to the player; and that butt-rock theme that plays during fairizing is rousing in much the same way Uematsu's Blue Dragon boss music was.\n\nFairy Fencer F has its bright spots, but it's not a game I can heartily recommend--there's too much detritus to dig through in order to get to the fun bits. Compile Heart has announced a sequel, so here's to hoping the move to more recent hardware will solve their games’ lingering technical problems--and here's to hoping the resulting games will be better as a result.\n\nDid you enjoy this review?\n\nFairy Fencer F\nFairy Fencer F / PC\n\nTHE GOOD\nFun combat with a good amount of depth\nLots of customization options to play with\n\nTHE BAD\nMotion-sickness-inducing framerate fluctuations\nProfoundly irritating characters","February 19","true","8.2"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/necreia/recommended/347830/","necreia","necreia","http://steamcommunity.com/id/necreia/","240 products in account","The Good\n- Excellent engine performance.  Solid 60 FPS at 1080p and not buggy.  Other than a little stutter on enemy load on level entry, it's flawless.  Other companies should strive to port games like this.\n- Visually beautiful.  Characters, outfits, effects, it’s all really nice to look at.\n- Character and skill advancement system has a good ‘hook’ to it to keep interesting.\n- Music is wonderful.\n\nThe Bad\n- Character personalities are extremely 1-dimensional.  There are no characters that I even remotely care for as they are cliché incarnate.\n- Level designs are completely uninspired, and at no point do I feel like I’m exploring.  Enemy and item placements make no sense.\n- Story is simple and boring.  There’s no sense of tension, which is likely due to the uninteresting characters.\n- Combat gets ‘old’ in that it’s a bit grindy.  Battles are solved with generally the same strategy every time, fairize meter resets, and enemy formations are not varied enough.\n\nIt reminded me a lot of the Neptunia series.  So, if that’s a series you’d like, you’ll probably like this one.  I'm just sorry to say that it's not for me.  I don't think it's terrible, but it's just below "interested to play it".  Better character depth or interesting level design would be enough to push it over the line.","October 4, 2015","false","6.6"," 11 of 19 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","11","19","0","0"

The combat is smooth and easy to learn even though there are multiple things that influence combat.  The combat is also very similar to the Neptunia V or the Neptunia Rebirth series.  The game is not exactly short either my first play through of the game took 33 hours.  The game has 3 different endings which does also increase the replayability of the game.\n\nUnlike in many RPG's you do not change your weapon instead as you play the game you aquire something called weapon boost points, these points allow you to customize your weapons stats increasing it's damage, magic attack, increase physical and magical defense how far your attack range is and couple other things.  With weapon boost points you are also able to get new skills, magic, abilites, and a few other things.\n\nSimilar to the Neptunia Rebirth series there is a world shaping option as well which allows you to change mobs or items in dungeons however unlike the Neptunia series there is normally a negative that goes with the positive for example you will gain 30% more exp but you will have 10% less defense.\n\nThe characters in the game are all likeable and have personality and over the course of the game you actually see their personalites change which is nice to see.  The english voices are all well done and none seem out of place for the character.\n\nThe bad in my opinion\n\nIf just following the storyline the game is rather easy.\n\nThe game has 3 different endings which is good however there really is no clear indication ever of what path you are on basically if you want the other two endings you will either have to go through it with trial and error or look up a guide.\n\nOther than that there really is no negative I can think of. Fun combat, Lots of customization, Easy to play, Enjoyable storyline, Enjoyable Characters, Good english voice acting, Characters with personality, and fairly long.\n\n","August 7, 2015","true","51.2"," 12 of 21 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","12","21","0","0"

Fairy Fencer F is different in my opinion.\n\nIt's a turn-based rpg with a combat similar to Hyperdimension Neptunia Rebirth series and Mugen Souls. If you played those games you'll probably notice many familiar things.\nFairy Fencer actually has a lot more useful and polished features compared to Neptunia Rebirth series. While the game starts off simple, its core gameplay gradually gains more and more stuff. And I'm not talking about just crafting feature or sub-quests. There are unlockable combos, enemy weaknesses, team-attack system, character-unique actions, fairy card bonuses, etc.\n\nSure there is still quite a few in-game stuff which makes you wonder 'This could've been so much better if you added X', or 'Why did they not exploit this further?', or even 'This system doesn't make much sense.'\nBut all in all I wouldn't call it a wasted potential.\n\nThe game is not the best, but a very solid and enjoyable JRPG in my opinion. I would definitely recommend trying it out.\nI also have to mention that Fairy Fencer F has a really good optimization.

Characters get 'Weapon Points' for each battle you win, these WP are used to unlock attacks/skills and you can spend them to unlock whatever you want in ANY order. It's quite liberating and as killing enemies wasnt too hard either, unlocking all those skills felt achievable once I saw how much WP I was getting. "Next...Next...Neext....Neeeext!!"

Overall good port from console, even if you want to play with mouse/keyboard (needs a little remapping, but not that much).\n\nStory-wise, this game is a typical J-RPG : the main part of the narration are the relations between the main characters, which have various personnalities. The story/universe is original enough to keep us interested, but not used to its full potential. Instead, it's used to bring more dialogs and character-development. Like most J-RPG. You like it or you don't, it's just a matter of taste. But if you like J-RPG, you'll probably like it.\nLike usual : you play western RPG for the world, eastern RPG for the characters.\n\nNow the graphics : pretty good. Full 3D anime-style with VN-like dialogs. The FPS are steady everywhere, the loadings are fast. You never really wait while playing this game.\n\nGameplay-wise, it's a mix between action-RPG and turn-based RPG. Mostly turn-based. But it's complex enough to allow strategy during the battles. Not that much as a full T-RPG. If you like T-RPG, but don't want to think to much or like the visuals of action-RPG, then this battle system is for you.\nHowever, battles can become a bit boring when you travel across a dungeon filled with weak enemies. But since we can avoid most battles, it's not that bad.\n\nBalancing : I haven't reached the end-game yet, but I can already see it coming. The main character is just a beast. Unlock the right skill (I don't remember which, but it's fairly fast to unlock), and spam it against medium-strong enemies. Money is not a problem after like 2-3 hours, so you can buy lots of TP potions and spam your skills. So, the strategy is : buff your main character, use him to focus on the DPS (don't waste damage on near-dead enemies unless you really need to lower their number), and finish the crumbs with the other characters. The support character can deal some damage, but not enough to really match the dps of the main character. I find this kinda sad : all other strategies make the battles a lot longer, and thus bring boringness.\n\nLast words : worth buying, worth playng, if you like J-RPG. You probably won't play it for 10 hours straight (it's not the kind of game that makes forget the flow of time), but you'll have no problem playing it like 2-3 hours a day everyday until you finish the game once or twice, since it's very enjoyable.","August 9, 2015","true","23.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

But you need to be patient because fairize need tension gauge to reach certain point to activate fairize.\n\n✔ SOUND & MUSIC\nI play this game is because i watch its opening and suddenly press add to chart button and buy it "lol no! i dont do that" but really, what make me interested in this game is one of the its soundtract. It has four songs, first its opening " Resonant world " second and third " Full Contract and All our might tonight " and the last one and my favorite is ending song " hikari " >.<\nah almost forget, this game is not full voiced, the character voice is only when you in main event, sub event is unvoiced.\n\n✔ CHARACTER\nCharacter from this ga,e is nice organized with their unique personality.

So the game itself is a fantastic JRPG it's more then i ever expected to be honest i didnt have such high hopes for it but after 15 minutes with this game i got consumed by it and couldn't stop to play :D. You play the game as Fang which is in my opinion the most funniest and trollish main hero i ever saw :D And with that lazy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and of course your other friends around you struggle around the world to collect the Furies and revive the Goddess.\n\nGood ones:\n+Epic and funny story\n+Epic combat system\n+Kawaii Usagi San <Later in the game>\n\nBad ones:\n-Not so many spells or special attacks as of Agarest for Example\n-No wonderfull special team combos or hidden special attacks containing 3-4 party members\n-Not so great talent and stat system\n\nAnd if you dont want to break your game experience dont spend your money on Additional Fairy Pack or even the Weapon Change Accessory Set and Armor Pack. On the description of Weapon Change Set it's said that's only cosmetic  but when you equip it it boosts your ATKP and MTKP tremendously. Same goes fo the Fairy Pack which gives you few ridicilously overpowered Faries but they cant be used for Godly Revival. Their stat growth and passive talents are game breaking.\n\nAfter all i reaaaly recommend this game for JRPG Beginners and Pro's alike ^^","August 13, 2015","true","20.5"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

Pretty much if you have played Re;Birth 1 with all of the DLC you would know something about this.... somewhat. Aside from that there will be similarities with most of the dungeons and monsters as well too if you've played a NepNep game as well.\n\nIn any case it is worth getting since this has a bit more of a serious storyline to it than what NepNep has at times. Also, since this is an Iffy game expect a Grindfest for certain things, such as the Pub Quests, and sometimes leveling to do other things like the DLC dungeons.\n\nAlthough there is also things that can be easily missable if you don't check everything before progessing into a storyline dungeon. Most of the things that can be missed is Lola's Side Quests, and thankfully there's a guide for that along with getting another secret character too.\n\nSo if you're thinking this is just :nepnep: reskined, you're only half right. Since they do have male Fencers involved in this..... and Pippin too, since I have no idea what that cat creature really is, just like the rest of the members in Fang's Party too.\n\nIn any case if you're on the fence for this game, I would suggest buying it when it goes on sale of course. :Eryn:","August 20, 2015","true","103.2"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

Avalance effect didn't cut it enough for me, I'd hoped for more in the style of Agarest Generations.\n\n\nThe World shaping is a bit dull and slow, especially because you can't stack effects. (at least it's not of my knowledge or experience that you can, it didn't work when I tried even though the affect radius of Swords varied.)\n- Corrected by Wua88e9r, you can infact stack the effects, thank you for providing a screenshot!\n\nAnd last but not the least, I missed visual changes when equipping new items, small things but it really adds to the "wow" effect when picking up an upgrade.\n\nI bought the game and I've not regret it, I had my fun and with 1$ per Dlc I find that you can get more than 10 hours out of it.\n\nFirst review I've written, hope it helps out in your decision of purchasing this game.","August 9, 2015","true","11.8"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","8","14","0","2"

Easy achievement, just need some hardwork.\n\nNow let me review things up.\n\nPROS :\n1. Battles are very similiar to your typical Idea Factory game such as Neptunia, which is easy for me to understand.\n\n2. The WP Systems are unique since you don't need to bother ur equipment such as changing it (Armor and acc''re exceptional). You get to choose how the character would be, like if you improve their P-ATK, they'll be hitting as hard as they could and vice versa with the other attributes.\n\n3. Some of you might not know about this, but I found this interesting recently. If you change the voice from English to Japanese, you get to hear your fairy's voice act whenever u open the Fairies tab, since it didn't worked that way on English VA.\n\n4. Stories are good. Each protagonist have their own problem and are pretty interesting to talk with.\nGame itself is fun, since it pretty much have a fun dialogues.\n\nCONS :\n1. It's getting pretty easy on 2/3rd playthrough, since everything are much easier without handicap. (Handicap : Like add monster lvl to increased its HP, DMG, DEF, exp and gold or sth).\n\n2. The DLCs (except the costumes) are ruining the fun of this game. Told you, this game is ALREADY easy as it is without DLC, so don't bother to buy the Ultimate Weapon pack and others, unless you don't want to waste your time for 50 hours ++ grinding for 100% Steam Achievements. (44hrs gameplay and 86% achievement)\n\n3. Maps are pretty much the same, developer only change your spawn point, which is lame IMO, LMAO. But it was something to be expected since this is an IDEA FACTORY game (I've played many of IF's games on console)\n\nMy conclusion :\n8.5/10\nIf you like Anime style JRPG, with a rich story you should consider on buying this.\nDon't buy this game if you don't care about the story, cause that's pretty much what makes the game INTERESTING in my opinion.","August 16, 2015","true","68.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You can boost the dungeon (using fury)\nAnd the best of that is\nIt has male character & harem style (LOL)\n\nCons:\n1. Graphic more worst than HN Re;Birth 2 (and Re;Birth 2 more worst than Re;Birth 1) Idk what should I say... I can't say this game is a classic JRPG (because there's some scene that having best graphics (ex: short movie in-the game)) well...

I'm almost at the end so I may change some things upon completion but I'll just note how I feel so far.\n\nStory: It's nothing to write home about, the plot twists and the like are really obvious. That being said, just like in Neptunia it is really the characters that make the story enjoyable. The humor is good, and unlike some Rebirth 2, it doesn't really use whole lot of memes. The character interactions are fun and Tsunako is responsible for their designs which is always great in my opinion.\n\nGameplay: Again, see Neptunia. There can be a lot of grind depending on what you're trying to do but if you just play through you should have no trouble. In fact, the only time I felt there was a difficulty spike was on certain side missions when attempting to get extra furies. You have your level ups, increasing the strength of each character but beyond that there is the Weapon Points system, which allows you to choose extra stat bonuses as well as customize progression through choices in combo moves, as well as extending both combos and weapon range. The fury system serves the duel purpose of prividing both character boosts through stat upgrades as well as allowing you to change each area in subtle but noticable ways. You could increase both the weapons points gained while at the same time doubling the damage BOTH you and your enemies put out. Depending on how you use them, you can speed up some of the grind in game.\n\nControls: I mainly played with an Xbox 360 controller. Despite this the controls were very repsonsive. I only add this because I recently went through the PS3 version of Neptunia Victory and found the controls to be somehat lagging in comparison. I breifly used KB+M to get a feel in that regard, and for the short time I used them if felt just as good.\n\nMusic: Enjoyable, like most jrpg's if you like em the music is usually good, and Compile Heart always does well in that regard.\n\nIf you typically enjoy a lot of the jrpg's that have been coming out lately, you'll no doubt find this a charming and enjoyable game. I've still yet to beat it so I can't say much for replay value, but judging from what I've played it doesn't seem like there could be much, at least until more of the DLC is released. It's worth the time and for those still on the fence, if you catch it on sale like I did, it is more than worth the money. Between the characters, story, and gameplay, you'll find a very comfy rpg.","August 20, 2015","true","34.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

So the game starts off with introducing the main character, Fang, who is one of the laziest protagonists ive ever seen, his first priority in any situation is food, and next is sleep. Having heard that pulling a fury out of teh ground will let him make any wish, and with a wish for food, he pulls the fury out and in turn becomes a Fencer, who wield a fury, and the fairy Eryn is introduced. She is really funny, and is the stragiht man to his antics, like food and sleep. They go on a journey and you meet another fencer in the first dungeon, but i wont go into detail as the story is one to experience for oneself. Just one quick word, ive only played a small amount of the story but its so gripping i cant stop, and have already played near 5 hours in the story mode (The ingame menu will tell you the total play time and this sessions play time)\n\nThe tutorial level comes quite quickly in this game and i for one love the combat system. Its turn based but each turn a character can move around a field in the map that has their starteing position as teh center of teh field.\nWhen your characters turn is in play, they can choose a variety of options, those being attack, skills/magic, items, wait and fairize. Ill get to attack a bit later.\nThe skills/magic menu when opened has two submenus for skills and magic, skills being physical attacks. Many different magics and skills have different radii and fields where you need to line up the attacking area, which is in red, with the enemies you want to fight.\nHuh? Whats Fairize you ask? Its sounds wierd but its where a fencer resonates with their fairy and thus their attack increases and special fairize skills are unlocked, oh and you get an anime-esque transformation sequence. And then theres also wait, Increases attack in teh next turn and makes you guard. A queue of who goes next is displayed on teh left side of teh screen.\nNow we'll get to attack. which when pressed can start a combo, this cant be done at the start, but as you go thorugh the game youll learn how to execute long combos.\n\nAs you go through the game collecting furies, they will have fairies which you can equip to your characters, which increase stuff like strength of sword/glaive/knuckle/etc attack or increase attack of one element of magic, you know earth air fire water. There is a way to make fairies stronger, but its part of teh story and i dont want to spoil anything.\n\nAll thats left to talk about is options, in which you can increase bgm voice and sound volumes seperatley and there a japanese to english voice switch, which is english default, which is a nice addition that i like seeing in these sorts of games.\n\nI highly recommend this to beginners of teh jrpg genre, veterans of rpgs in general, and anyone who wants a nice singleplayer campaign rpg expereince.\n","August 6, 2015","true","107.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This game is similar to hyperdimension neptunia in many ways. The story is great and you will fall in love with the characters. The combat is somewhat the same as hyperdimention neptunia but now features a skill page that you can upgrade.

You clear a level, go back to town, chat, clear a level go back to town and chat, all the way through the end.\n\nThe game is very easy and my god please play with the japanese voices, english ones will make you cringe every time you battle.\n\nWhat I really liked with this game is how fast the battles can be, since you can skip every single animations. In fact you can also skip every scenes. I made one playthrough(newgame+) and skipped most battles and every scenes and it took me 45 minutes to make it, lol.\n\nThe game has some really good ideas done right, but it just gets boring very fast, even though I personally enjoyed it. The battles lack some strategy and some better weakness/resist system, as well as the character developpement is meh; once you're mid-late game it kinda halts there. Music is all right and the level design is a joke.\n\nLate game; the characters are pretty much identical since they nearly got all the same stats, the only difference is the main character having some slight extras, and a few different spells here and there between the characters.\n\nFairy Fencer F also has plenty of side-quests and stuff, but it's really boring and pretty much identical to what you do in the storyline.\n\nWhen I first saw the battle system i thought: Wow it's like Grandia/chrono trigger! But it easily fell appart once you fully understand it. It's still decent though. But it lacks strategy.\n\nFor my experience, I'd rate it an 8 since jrpgs are my favorite genre of games, but I EASILY understand the metacritic score of 66. The game feels empty and unpolished.\n\nAlso crashed on a few occasions.\n\nIf I were you, I wouldn't pay more than 10$ for it.","February 17","true","67.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The controls lead a bit to be desired but that may just be me, especially in the combat system, which is quite intriguing and fun. However, there is one majore flaw in this game for me. I go to the first area, some foresty place, which gives me some free roam, which is awesome, except that after the first battle, the graphics will freeze. The game gives me two images it shifts between, imagine a gif with only two frames. Annoying, eh? That's what I get. However, the game is still playing, and I have even won battles in this utterly confusing state! I mean, I think I won them. I haven't been able to find a fix and would most certainly be thrilled if someone gave me a fix, but for now I am utterly perplexed why this keeps happening in almost the same spot. It is aggravating and I wish to play more of the game, but cannot. SO if this game works for you, it is most certainly worth it! If it doesn't work for you, well, junt a fix better than I?

Some are really rude\n- Switches between 3D and 2D\n- Reminded me of Kingdom Hearts at first glance\n- Get stabbed to unlock your power\n- The main character likes sleep and food. Easiest time I've had connecting to a character\n- DLCs can be turned off, because the DLC gear is so OP, especially for beginngers\n- Simple, so you don't have to think so hard about playing this. Give the gamer brain a break\n\nMy Cons:\n- Some characters are extremely irritating.\n- Lots of dialogue scenes (skip became my best friend)\n- 3D camera felt awkward at times, either hovering too high or too low behind the character, Wish it was a tad further back to have a wider range of view\n- Hooking up my PS4 controller was annoying. Might not be a game problem but it interrupts the game flow when the controls get 'stuck'. I've read that other people have this problem too. Sucks right?\n- Very simple, so don't get this for the challenge\n\nMix:\n- After playing Skyrim, the turn-based combat was irritiating for a long while. Also, as with most turn-based combat, it can get stale and repetitive. Luckily, it's pretty.\n\nAs my second Anime game, it's far more enjoyable that the first one I ever played. I want to get stronger, unlock more, collect all the furies, and free the lady. So that's a good thing right? It makes me want to do those things and keep playing.\n\n(PS I did get this game on Sale with all the DLCs so that may have sweetened my attitude towards it)","February 3","true","16.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

After quite a few hours with this game, I can safely go into detail about whether you should buy it or not, keeping it spoiler free.\n\nIf you are TL:DR then here's the nutshell version: I love it.\n\nSTORY: Again not going to spoil anything in the story and rather experience it yourself. However, in terms of how good it is...It can be slow to repetitive at times, and i think I skipped a scene at one point because I felt it was irrelevant. The story itself is okay with quite a few twists to keep things refreshing. Though I feel that the story may be the weakest element in the game, AGAIN not that it's bad, it's enjoyable, but it ain't exactly perfect. If it's worth something, I did tear up a bit at times from certain heavy moments. SADLY: You don't get to make any real choices, it's rather straight forward with only three endings. One you get from ignoring all subevents involving your party. And two for...just google it.\n\nCharacters: Most if not all of them are brimming with personality and are unique in their own way, including the Fairies in which our main characters possess. The protagonist thankfully is not the cliche brave and goody-to-shoes hero, rather far from it as you will see if you start the game. Each character is lovable and I remember their names well, and I'm bad at remembering names, so that's quite the accomplishment.\n\nGameplay: Turn based as one might expect. Nothing much to say. You can use basic attacks, magic, or special animated skills to attack your opponents. You may also customize combos in which to attack your enemies with. Each character also has a special ability with special effects for each individual. There are other elements as well which are quite refreshing, but I don't feel like going into detail since it would be explained in the game later.\n\nSoundtrack: Fairly nice, especially when you use you VERY VERY powerful ability or 'FAIRIZE' as well. Though it can get a bit bland, but overall there are some tracks that stick out.\n\nVoice Acting: FOCUS FOCUS FOCUS FOCUS!!! This is important! In my opinion i highly recommend you play this game with the japanese voice over in the options tab. The english dub is...there for those who really hate japanese, but I don't...find them believable like I do with the japanese Dub. The characters feel more alive without the english voice over, and the experience with the game fell a bit when I tried the english version for a while. Japanese is my recommended voice over.\n\nOverall rating: I would at least give this game a 8/10. Still places to improve on, but I've played a solid 24 hours with it, and even if you beat the game, you can restart the story without losing all your progress and restarting. There is replay value depending how you do on the first run.\n\nWARNING: I do not think there is an autosave for this game so before you leave and murderize your computer when you come back, always save. ALWAYS. I didn't lose any progress because i was paranoid as hell since the game leaves save points to help you do it manually. But you can also do it on the world map.\n\nHope this was helpful.","September 9, 2015","true","24.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Besides, I'm biased.\n\nI will try to keep this spoiler-free. Put simply, Fairy Fencer F might not be for everyone, but if you like turn-based JRPGs, lots of customization, or VN-styled cutscenes, it's perfect. Plus there are waifus. And husbandos, if you like that.\n\nPros:\n+ Runs very smoothly, even on my toaster computer (you can change resolutions too)\n+ Tons of customization with World Shaping/Furies and the WP system\n+ Cute art, cool designs, and likable characters, with character development!\n+ Not your typical battle system - action yet turn-based, tension gauge which you use to 'Fairize' aka power up\n+ Cool skills, and you can also skip them and make battles go much faster by holding down the Next button\n+ Fully voiced in Japanese! Even the fairies are voiced!!\n+ Multiple endings and subevents in a kinetic visual novel style; multiple playthroughs available/needed\n+ Harley and Ethel\n\nYMMV\n* Very easy without any way to change the difficulty\n* Difficulty also doesn't change on next playthrough, though makes the playthrough much faster\n* Synthesizing/alchemy and quest system, but don't have any real impact or incentives\n* Some of the OST is memorable, but others are just typical RPG fare (I like the second Fairize song best)\n* Dungeons and 3D look alright, but are reused and are fairly short\n* Plot twist is only somewhat predictable, but a little frustrating\n\nCons:\n- Pretty bland setup with some stereotypes and a cliche JRPG backstory (two deities fought, good vs. evil, wish-granting)\n- Characters might seem annoying at first (Fang was awful at the beginning, but even he matures by the end)\n- No Harley or Ethel route\n- Godly Revival has no effect on actual story (you'll see what I mean)\n\nBasically, get it because Tiara is best girl.","January 18","true","29.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","5"

The game play is very similar to Hyper-dimension Neptunia and take the role of a third person turn based RPG. The level grinding in the game never got to tedious and each battle did require some strategy and the characters equipment and move customisation took quite a lot of thinking, you could also put certain effects on the dungeons which put even more thought into what to do. The story is overall very engaging a throws some unexpected curve balls that even I, an avid anime fan and RPG player didn't see coming, which should be commended. The humour in Fairy Fencer F should also be praised, it had me laughing quite a few times. The characters are one of the best parts of the game, the main character, Fang's character development was really incredible as he retains his attitude but at the same time turns into an empathetic character who genuinely cares about his friends. The other characters such as Tiara and Eryn get little to no character development (excluding Ethel, best girl) but are still funny, admirable and relatable, you really do come to care about these characters. The music was also overall good though some tracks did start to lose some appeal after a while they still remained decent to listen to. There is also a fair amount of stuff to do after you finish the game and is impossible to do everything in one play through. Okay I've talked this game up enough time to delve into it's flaws.\n\nFirst of all the difficulty, in my first play through I completed the game in about 32 hours during that time I died twice. For clarification one of those times was because I wasn't paying attention to the game and did one battle too many while EXP grinding. As long as you aren't a complete idiot and pay attention this games difficulty isn't that high and overall isn't the most challenging though I'm an RPG veteran. Secondly, there was a point where they say you have to pull all the swords out of goddess to unseal them and then they completely forget about it and it has no impact on the ending. Thirdly, the ridiculous hidden characters/fairies, as an RPG I understand secret characters are going to be difficult to unlock but Lola's requirements are really unforgiving as you need to complete all of her side quests, which are really easy to miss. For the two S-rank fairies I have no issue but one particular A-rank fairy, Dohn, is completely asinine much worse than Lola. To unlock him you need to do a  pub request that only appears when you haven't completed a certain dungeon and you have to complete it immediately and you get it after you complete the dungeon. Now you might think that's not so bad but allow me to provide some context, you get given no signs that you get this fairy after completing this request, the quest is only available for a short while when you haven't completed a dungeon so you are viable to miss it. Adding onto the chance of missing it is the fact that pub requests barely offer any good rewards for completing them and most of the time you won't have requests high up on your priorities. All of this culminates in a fairy that even harder to get than the S-ranks.\n\nI think that this game is for casual gamers who haven't got all the time in the world but can spare a couple hours a week to play this game. It's funny, engaging and entertaining.\nOverall, a good game.","January 12","true","92.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The story is pretty light hearted with some darker bits in at part, so it's not just a circus show the whole time or anything like that, playing out more kind of like a comedic anime with serious undertones here and there.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/HylianSoldier/recommended/347830/","HylianSoldier","Esshi-Senpai","http://steamcommunity.com/id/HylianSoldier/","72 products in account","Fariy Fencer F i would say is a great game with a great story and good gameplay in some aspects.\n\nThe gameplay is like the hyperdimension games where you have your ususal attacks and combos (to get combos you need to level up your weapon by weapon boosting) and you have your special attacks in this case skills and magic attacks along with an attack only avalible in the farize form. Farize form could be related to the hdd in neptunia but its not like that you need to fill the tension bar to a certian point and then you can select the farize form what comes along with some good music where everything is buffed up but you can be sent out of this form due to the tension bar what needs to be kept a look at when using this form. Lastly theres special moves what only that character can use this can range from a buff in strength (Fangs Serious face gives a buff in strength but causes every attack to cost SP) these moves are balanced in certian ways but can be usefull where you can scan the enemy to see their stats so you can plan what attack to use next but these do take up a turn so be sure to keep the character using the move safe and not low on health.\n\nThe music in this game is amazing with every new place having its own track along with certian boss fights getting their own music and with the farize theme (theres 2 farize themes with the second being the more better one). I would say that the music is worth the listen to.\n\nThe story is what makes the game that good (along with the gameplay of course) and the story does have its moments where the tone changes and it changes alot in this game. I wont say nothing really relating to the main plot itself due to spoilers and you need to experience the story at first hand to have some really good reactions.\n\nI would recommend this game to fans of rpgs and jrpgs and probably to the fans of the hyperdimension series. I would also recommend this to really anyone looking to start playing jrpgs and rpgs this would be a good one to start at.\n\nThere is some problems mainly going towards using an xbox one controller but that can be fixed easily with downloading the old drivers again to fix it and aside from that there really is not that many problems with the game itself.","August 6, 2015","true","51.5"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

This JRPG was especially better to me than the Neptunia series because it's amazing how each character has their own unique background already.\n\nArt : I actually been in love with the artist for a while, but the models of the weapons actually brings my attention more because damn, it looks cool.\n\nStory : Overall the story was good, but the endings weren't as exciting to be honest.\n\nCharacters : Characters are the ones that made me feel like the game was special. With their own characteristics, and their fairy makes them exciting.\n\nGameplay System : What disturbs me the most on the battle system was the same looking attack animation each time (I only did same combos because of the damage output). Nonetheless, the skills, magics etc were actually quite cool to use, but I also like the idea of the fury effect. It somehow made it easier to farm WP + Levels.\n\nBonus : Sequel? I seen the trailer but seriously, 6 people in one battle party? Would be nice to display more but I am more concerned to watch every single one of them.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/InfinitePeace/recommended/347830/","InfinitePeace","InfinitePeace","http://steamcommunity.com/id/InfinitePeace/","406 products in account","Fun game, but there is no difficulty slider and eventually you end up just playing it for the story and not for the gameplay.\n\nExploring dungeons is pointless, there's nothing to look at (graphics are console/outdated), nothing to explore too. You're better off going in a straight line to the objective in every dungeon instead of looking for loot/monsters to kill. Side quests are practically worthless, rewards are ok but when you literally stomp every enemy your level (and then some) you don't really need to be careful when playing. For perspective, I had to play against enemies 2x my level to even get a sort of challenge, since I couldn't roflstomp enemy mobs then. So don't buy it for the gameplay.\n\nStory wise though it was fun. Funny to play through, has funny little bits of trivia that you can pick up while you're in town by other civilians, though those interactions are just going to a menu (kinda) and selecting characters to talk to.\nIgnoring the side stories, the main storyline is quite enjoyable. Only "problem" would be that it's not particularly deep in terms of character development, but that's irrelevant since it's pretty much a casual game to enjoy for say... 14 hours or so.\n\nCharacters also have weird challenges that you could grind if you wanted to, but those seem to be put in for those who wish to punish themselves. Like "jump 10, 50, 100, 2000, 5000 times in a dungeon with <x> character". And the reward for completing more and more jumps/attacks/whatever doesn't stack well, so eh.\n\n7/10, worth getting on sale. Not sure about full price though, since I'm fine with spending 7.99 for what I got, but full price of $30 is a bit much. I really would've liked a bit more depth to gameplay/story for more fun, but it's ok as it is.\n\nBuy on sale (like all games), grab the additional dlcs (get the ultimate armor pack to enjoy the OP playstyle faster), could skip the cosmetic sets though.","February 25","true","45.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/brownninja97/recommended/347830/","brownninja97","Brownninja97","http://steamcommunity.com/id/brownninja97/","402 products in account","Fairy Fencer F is an interesting game, it somewhat appears in the shadow of the Hyperdimension series and with the polish that those games had you should have high expectations for this one.\n\nIn the end those expectations are met. It certainly is fun and hilarious, you really cant go wrong with it, there is a pretty nice bang for buck with this title.\n\nStoryline: At first its pretty linear and well it drags you along with what seems like a cookie cutter story. Well things change and things happen which arent expected. The various endings are a bit lack luster though, they are bitter sweet but leave you wanting more. Though im not sure if this is getting a sequel, not even sure how they could do a sequel with the storyline this has. Its a lot more serious then hyperdimension but its still full of various jokes.\n\nCombat: The combat is very similar to that of hyperdimension's, by that i mean its got nice effects, nice moves, variation etc etc. Unless hyperdimension you have to earn the combats and the amount of attacks you can do, personally i think its a bit of a pain, it can become a grind fest. You control three charecters in this game.\n\nThe port: The port is good, no crashes at all, audio lag for a few seconds if you tab out but that fixes itself very quickly. Textures are serviceable, they could be higher res but i cant complain, they are good enough. The game runs at a solid 60fps. It uses the windows resolution system which means you can go nuts with the resolution options, you want 4k thats fine, want 8k yeah it works(suprisingly well with my 680 20fps at 8k isnt bad).\n\nOverall: If you like anime, rpgs, funny storys, bang for buck, multiple endings, hack n slash etc then this is a really nice game to buy.\n\nSide note this game is optimized for a controller which honestly you guys need, many games work a lot better with controllers and this is one of them. it would be nice for it to be optimized for mouse and keyboard, id say that is currently the biggest issue.","August 29, 2015","true","28.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I have no problem with that because frankly I adore this battle system. Rather than just picking an enemy (or several enemies) like a typical JRPG, you move around a limited area on your turn and pick enemies then, sometimes with a box or something for which enemies you're going to hit. It adds a little extra element to it, in my opinion. Unlike Neptunia, basic attacks use a selection rather than an aiming box, so you can only attack one enemy at a time.\n\nPersonally I quite liked the story aswell, and as expected from Compile Heart (or at least, coming from Neptunia) I especially liked the characters. Except the ones I wasn't meant to like. There are only very few characters I don't find myself caring about, and they were either generic NPCs or showed up for only a short time. I do like how each o the fairies you collect has their own personlity in the menu, though.\n\nIn terms of being a port, it seems to be rather good. It's not once ran slowly for me, and in fact the framerate appears to be an improvement from the 30 that the PS3 original apparently had. I've only found one minor glitch so no problems there either. I don't know how well Keyboard and Mouse control, but it seems to have keyboard icons for menus which is a step up from Neptunia also.\n\nAll in all, I liked it. Whether you're going to like it, well, that's up to your opinon, but if you can't find anything about it you mind then I say give it a shot.","August 23, 2015","true","24.1"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zanameth/recommended/347830/","zanameth","Zanameth","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zanameth/","342 products in account","While this game suffers from a good amount of flaws (see below for details), it still manages to be an enjoyable experience.\nI'll be speaking numbers and mechanics so you get to know exactly what to expect from this product, and whether it's for you or not.\nIf you've played other games from this developer (like the Neptunia series), you can expect lots of similar aspects.\n\n\n\nThe good points :\n- Fairy Fencer F takes about 25 hours to complete, and about 60 hours to get all achievements (I'm nearly there, so it's an estimate). This is a decent amount of time for an RPG, and at this price point, it's quite reasonable.\n\n- While the story is kind of a classic (hero must defeat an evil god), the narrative makes it enjoyable. A few plot twists here and there, with some of them being predictable, and some others not (which is the good part). The main protagonist doesn't have your typical "hero" personnality, which is refreshing. Interactions between characters are good enough, and you can get attached to some of them. This is a good sign, because if you can't feel anything for any character, that means the story and dialogues are bland and pretty much suck.\n\n- Good graphics, and runs on a solid 60FPS at 1080p without problems. I honestly don't care about 30 or 60 FPS, but some do so I'll write it down just in case.\n\n- Not a lot of grinding to do, except for achievements (the 100M gold is a bad joke, since you barely need money in this game at all).\n\n- Combat mechanics are turn-based, and you can transform ("fairize") your characters during combat to give them extra power.  Classic, but always works.\n\n- Good soundtrack and voice acting (Japanese, of course). With Japs, you know you can expect quality on these aspects, and this game is no exception.\n\n- World shaping. Basically, you can use special, reusable items to give special effects to a dungeon you are about to enter (increased/decreased xp/damage, etc).\n\n\n\nThe flaws :\n\nNow, I'm gonna spend a lot more time on this part, because some stuff definitely can't be overlooked, and needs to be explained properly.\n> If you're a veteran RPG player like I am, there are other, more subtle aspects of an RPG that you have high expectations for.\n> If you're a casual RPG player, and are not too picky, these flaws won't probably mean much to you.\n\n- First and foremost, this game suffers from the "Mash the attack button and that's pretty much it" syndrome. I literally (and I'm not kidding) did the whole game without using AND learning a single combat ability or combo. I just pressed the attack button continuously, and used potions to heal myself from time to time. The only thing I did was pay a passive skill to increase my EXP and gold earned (mid-way through the game, because it costs a ton to learn), and everything else was put into basic stat increase (power, defense, etc).\n• In this game, you can learn magic and cast spells, but enemies/bosses are not proving very challenging so it just feels like a waste of time. Magic that increases a stat (speed, power, defense, magic, etc) are only single-target based, and last so few turns that by the time you've cast a boost on all of your party, it'll soon be gone from your first target.\n• If anything, making a "mage" is more about fun rather than a necessity. All characters, as you recruit them, come as versatile, and you end up prefering physical attacks because it makes things faster (going in menus is a pain after a while, no surprise there). Basic stat increase is also pretty much a joke, because it will make too little of a difference to your character anyway, except for special stats like the attack range and the number of combos.\n• Weaknesses to elements like fire, ice, etc, have barely been exploited, just like status debuffs, so you end up not even bothering about them.\n• Overall, the majority of the battle system & mechanics are completely useless.\n\n- The game also suffers from the "Idea Factory loves reusing stuff" syndrome (Idea Factory is the developer, mind you). If you've played the Neptunia series, you know what I'm talking about. The game reuses a lof of textures for monsters and environments, and you'll definitely find stuff, albeit with some slightly different colors, looking very similar to other stuff you've already seen before. Halfway through the game, something happens and this flaw becomes extremely accentuated, which I didn't appreciate at all. More effort was needed.\n\n- Some achievements are only there to annoy you. If you're not a completionist then it's all good, but putting a 100M Gold achievement when you barely need gold the whole game doesn't make any sense.\n\n- Lack of character customization. Not a lot of armors, weapons have a fixed sprite most of the time, and there are too few armors that change your characters' visual appearance as well. The Neptunia series had a lot more visual variety, so I got a bit dissapointed here. Good amount of visual accessories, but many of them are reused between characters.\n\n- A menu to customize your battle formation? The game is unfortunately not challenging enough (even for a newbie player) for it to have any usefulness.\n\n- The game does have a new game+ feature, but it doesn't bring a lot of extra content, unfortunately. It's more about a few features to get all the achievements, or to see another possible ending route (3 possible), rather than anything else.\n\n\n\nClosing words :\n\nThere are some stuff that I didn't mention, like the crafting or the collection of items called "Furies" which can be leveled up to give you special stats. I usually skip stuff that isn't important to the review (though it doesn't mean that these are bad).\n\nOverall, I'd say :\n- If you're a casual RPG player, and if you're looking at the story first and then the gameplay, then you'll definitely have a good time. The story is decent, the characters are likable, the dialogues are fun, and the battle mechanics are what you'd expect from a typical RPG.\n- If you're a seasoned RPG player looking first and foremost for difficulty and challenge, then you're likely to be dissapointed. All the game mechanics pretty much act as a "wrapper" for the story.\n\nFrom my personal standpoint, I buy Idea Factory games because I enjoy the colorful art, the nice looking anime-esque characters, the cool Japanese voice acting, and the story. I definitely do not buy them for their difficulty or game mechanics. If you know where your priorities are, you know where to set your expectations (especially with Idea Factory games).\n\nVerdict : "Yes, but."\nAlbeit a few flaws, Fairy Fencer F is a good RPG that will most likely leave a positive impression on you.\nOh, and it has nekomimis, I forgot to mention that. Very important.\n\nHave a great day,\n\nZanameth","August 11, 2015","true","65.8"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

Thought to myself, did I bought the wrong game @.@ After playing for a couple of minutes, and yes, the conversation is like visual novel style, but gameplay consist of dungeon. Your job in the game is to collect fairies and boost your stats. How you grow, depends on how you build your character. Highly recommend this game!

What's happening?"\n"Um...Hi."\n"I have a question for you. What does the 'B' in Susan B. Anthony stand for?"\n"Uhhhh"\n"BOOYAH!" I pull a silver dollar out of my shirt pocket and present it and my car keys to the confused valet.\n"Take good care of it and I'll throw in another Susanna." I remark with a chuckle. My name's PepsimanVsJoe and apparently I'm supposed to write a review for Fairy Fencer F. The problem is-\n"The problem is you just gave your keys away!" My partner cuts in.\n"Huh? That was the valet."\n"Have you ever heard of a Taco Bell having valet parking?!" He looks at me like I'm an idiot. "God you're dumb. Yet somehow you can manage to put two words together. I mean for crying out loud you don't even play videogames. I don't even play videogames! I hate them!" He sighs, cracks his knuckles for an eternity, and continues. "Luckily for us, there are three people that enjoyed playing Fairy Fencer F, and they're interested in talking about it."\n"Really? Wow. I'd love to hear from them."\n\n"...They're right over here." He leads me to a booth near the back of the high-class restaurant.\nA young man extends a hand, which I promptly shake. "Hi PepsimanVsJoe! My name is Piven. My favorite games include Halo, Call of Duty, and Gears of War."\n"And you like Fairy Fencer F? Really?"\n"Yes...well okay yeah it sounds strange when you think about it. Fairy Fencer F is an anime RPG about fairies and crap, but I think it's a well-done game. It reminds me of...well...Taco Bell. It's comfort food, the kind you never really get tired of. Playing online multiplayer gets pretty stressful, so it's nice having something I can chill with. The protagonist, Fang, is an interesting guy. He talks about eating and sleeping a lot, but he also has a strong sense of justice."\n\n"I stopped listening after you compared the game to Taco Bell." said a voice hiding behind a Playstation Vita. Ignoring my meager attempts at a handshake, he introduces himself: "The name is Joss. I play all of the RPGs. I'm an RPG sponge."\n"What would you say is Fairy Fencer F's most admirable quality?" I ask.\n"Piven merely glossed over the storyline, which is actually pretty well done. It shows a surprising amount of ambition, even if it can be uneven at times. Thankfully the well-written characters make the far-fetched aspects of the plot easier to swallow. Also, unlike the Neptunia series, Compile Heart's bread & butter, this game isn't as light-hearted, which makes for a good change of pace."\n"Yeah, The Neptunia games are pretty cool." Piven cuts in. "But you missed the reason why someone would prefer Fairy Fencer F."\n\n"Oh really?" Joss frowns. Actually I'm just guessing he's frowning. It's hard to tell since he hasn't moved his face from behind that Vita.\n"Playing FFF really highlights the pacing issues the Neptunia games can sometimes have. In those games you can spend a lot of time repeating certain dungeons, or going to multiple locations just to view more cut-scenes. Sometimes I just want to play the game, or at least get some new characters and have them stick around for more than a dungeon or two."\n"...You have a point, FFF does seem a bit fresher, despite sharing many of the same qualities as the Neptunia series. However, FFF lacks the unique personality of the Gamindustri's culture and lore. That's not even considering the complete lack of amusing references and characters designed after your favorite games."\n"My favorite games? Last I checked. Most of the NPCs in Neptunia are Merio, Looigi, and a bunch of other random nonsense from Japanese magazines that I've never heard of. They don't have anything to say, but I have to read every ridiculous comment that flies way over my head, just so I don't miss a plan or whatever else I need to 100% complete the game. At least Fairy Fencer F keeps everything focused. It tells a story I can relate to...at least as far as fairies transforming into weapons that are pulled out of the ground will allow." Before Joss can argue, he's cut off by -\n\n"Name's Pam. I like 2D shooters, anything with a lot of action, and I'm weak for MMOs and Diablo-clones. You two fail to realize - or are completely ignoring -  the real problem with Fairy Fencer F: It's too easy! Sure, I can't go into these games expecting a level of depth comparable to hardcore dungeon-crawlers like Wizardry, but FFF is less challenging than the Neptunia games. At least those titles have the neat combo-systems, the three kinds of attacks, and so on. All I did in this game was mash buttons. The only fights I lost were when I was severely underleveled, and that was the DLC."\nI cut in "You said you liked the game...didn't you?"\n"Of course I did! Compile Heart doesn't create challenging RPGs, but they deserve all the love in the world for making it so effortless to get through battles quickly. I can watch the flashy special moves, then just skip through everything for the real content: the characters and story."\n"I agree." Piven speaks up. "Compile Heart knows how to cater to its fans. They've captured an audience that ignores Visual Novels...by creating Visual Novels with RPG elements."\n"Hate to say it, but I agree with dudebro." Joss admits. "What makes this game enjoyable is that it allows the player to enjoy as much - or as little - of an RPG they want. They can avoid grinding and focus on equipment as well as tactics, or simply focus on what matters to them. Overall, I think we all just wanted a relaxing game, that didn't demand a lot from us."\n\n"Psh...Grinding." Pam grumbles. "The grind in this game is the worst. I think it's a law somewhere that Compile Heart has to include a couple ridiculous achievements that take forever. I think they do it just to sell DLC. Also this game has a plethora of minor cheevos. They're the kind where you get a little stat boost if you jump a thousand times or get the first strike in however many battles. It just seems like content for the sake of it, but at this point I'm just nitpicking."\n"Hold up. Did I just admit to playing a Visual Novel?" Piven looks like he wants to lie down and cry.\nMy partner, lulled to sleep by this incredibly fascinating dialogue, suddenly snaps awake. "Well. There you have it PepsimanVsJoe. That was Piven, Joss, and Pam with their thoughts on the game. I expect a full write-up by tomorrow morning."\n"I have the concluding paragraph already in my head." I tell him as I wave goodbye to everyone else. "Thanks Mr. E"\n\nFairy Fencer F is a polished and enjoyable adventure. For those who don't make it a point to challenge themselves, this RPG won't offer much in the way of depth. However, you will be too busy being charmed by its characters, art, decent storyline, and superb music to notice. Though it's also fair to say that non-fans of Neptunia, probably won't appreciate what this game brings to the table. The more traditional Western Fantasy might also be too much to bear for gamers expecting hi-tech futuristic worlds influenced entirely by videogames (not to mention the discouraging lack of Nep-Nep). Still, as somebody who is frequently swamped by hardcore dungeon-crawlers, complex and difficult 2D shooters, and the frustrating & fruitless endeavor that is raising my k/d ratio; I will always welcome Compile Heart.\n\nOvercome with the satisfaction that my brilliance brings, I don't even notice the valet running into me with my car.\n\n"Ugh.." My head is killing me. I slink out of my bed and nearly trip on a plastic cup. "The hell? Oh right...the weeknight special." I say to myself. Sometimes after work I'll grab a super mega-64 oz gulpathon from the nearest gas station. Whatever I drink from that cup is then replaced with rum, vodka, scotch, whatever is on hand really.  Needless to say, having one of these every night probably isn't the greatest life choice. Neither is writing reviews either but...well...Hopefully I didn't write something ridiculously pretentious last night.","August 29, 2015","true","31.6"," 13 of 25 people (52%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","52","13","25","11","1"

"without the dlc's ofc's"\n\nAt the moment i bought that game i thought ..... damn what a crap and i'm really honest here, but after a while i really started to like this game and the Story itself is really nice, with a sweet plot twist.\n\nAbout the difficult of this game, it is not really that hard if you are a fan of RPG's or JRPGS, at some point u find yourself grinding for some ability's and it get's kinda boring, since u become way to overpowerd....\n\nSince i didn't buy the DLC's with the lvl Cap and so on i think there is still some stuff that is pretty amazing and fun, but if you only bought the game to play it the DLC's ain't needed at all, it is just a way to continue the grinding to lvl 1000.. with some extra Fairy's, and those ain't really needed to finish the game itself.\n\nAs a conclusion, this game is awesome, if you are the typ who likes animes and loves to play Final Fantasy or other RPG's give it a shoot since it is currently on Promotion sale u can't make anything wrong at all. The character's are created with love and u will feel it in every moment a sequence comes up for sure "not speaking about the wiggel factor from some female character's here when they morph...", the fairy's are funny and unique everyone has a own character this gives the feeling of collecting something unique and not like collecting stones or some kinda of crap where everything is identical.\n\nand for a end of this hand's down guy's and girl's we all know Harley is the best ^_^/","August 11, 2015","true","25.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

It's not amazing, it's not the best thing ever, it's simply what a game should be, fun and entretaining. It doesn't try to go beyond and break any new barriers, but it also isn't lazy or badly done.\n\nThe story is not really that special, but it keeps you engaged enough to keep on wanting to know what's going to happen. Not going to give any details because that would take forever.\n\n\nThe characters are stereotypes that anyone is used to see in any anime. Though the main character is by far the most entretaining character because he really does not seem to care for the main quest, not even for the other characters... to a certain extent. But his interaction with Eryn, and the rest of the group do make them more interesting then what they are in their roots.\n\n\nThe gameplay is redundant. It's always the same thing over and over again. Usualy this is a problem, except for the fact that the gameplay is rather fun, so it doesn't really matter. The special attacks feature some nice animations and the transformations get you really pumped expecially when you are fighting a boss.\n\nThe music complements the game nicely and the world in itself is rather charming.\n\nOverall this is a really nice game that will make you want to play it for hours and hours. There is alot of stuff to do like side quests and other fairies to find, skills to upgrade, etc, so you will always have something to do.\n\nIf i had to rate, i would give it an 8/10.","August 22, 2015","true","20.8"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Considering the achievements (of which many are rediculous), the game is expected to be played through multiple times (NG+).\n\nFYI : TLDR at the bottom.\n\nStoryline - 8/10 - Actually has a clearly explained plot line.  Some plot twists and variation of character. Very comedic.\n\nCharacter Development - 7/10 - The intereactions b/t characters is fun, energetic, and sometimes realistic.  Very few of the character's personalities evolve.\n\nGaemplay - 6.5/10 - The bar for the difficulty lvl is set way to low.  It's not in the least bit hard.  I expected at least some challenge.  I'm not counting the lvl req'd DLC dungeons(which aren't plot related and aren't req'd to be completed or even played at all), that's a cop-out.\n\nAt least fairies could be used to modify the stats of any given dungeon.  So if you just wanted things to be hard, you could make it so no spells/ablilties can be used, chars take dbl dmg, have reduced resistances, can't cure debuffs, etc.  On the flipside, +% exp/gold/WP/stats/droprate.  Most faires gave both a (+) & a (-).  Still didn't improve overall game difficulty.\n\nBattles are easy to learn, manage, and fun to watch. Quickly becomes repetitive.\n\nEquipment was too easy to come by to bother making it with mats. Level growth was automatic boosts to all stats, and the only variation is via equipped Fairy and Weapon Points (WP).  Don't get me started on the player specific abilities, that is a sordid story rife with complaints.\n\nOn the plus side WP had a good deal of variation, but alot of the magic/weapon attacks seemed either useless or overtly interchangeable with 2-3 others.  Why would I want to use magic to cure a debuff if there is an item for it?   Nothing in the game denies the use of items.  Granted AoE dispell of all debuffs was nice, but characters were only ever afflicted with one at any given time.  Not mentioning most were temporary or lacked any sort impact on the battle.\n\nIt was fun to make a bunch of items I'd never need or use, though. (Max Elixirs, the AoE HP pots, etc)\n\nSome people complain about the AoE targeting sensitivity being too high, but these people are just lazy. This is easily remedied by rotating the camera.\n\nGame Stability and Hardware Req'd - 9/10 -  Game has low hardware requirements but remains nice to look at.  Art style and quality gel together well.  Objects in the world look like they belong and doesn't have any obvious/jarring visual errors.\n\nLoses a point for poor dungeon initialization programming.  Major FPS drops everytime a new dungeon is loaded, due to all the mobs being spawned simultaneously.  Major programming bug that should have been fixed prior to port.\n\nVoice Acting and Music - 9/10 - To my surprise, the english voice acting was superb.  I'll probably play through the game again with the original voices to see how it compares, but not anytime soon.\n\nMusic was enjoyable for the first 10hrs or so. By then you've heard almost 80% of the music you'll hear all game and they're just on repeat.  Was nice that one of the battle specific songs was swapped out halfway through.  It was seriously grinding on my nerves, by then.\n\nTLDR\n\nOverall, I enjoyed the game.  The characters were entertaing to watch and the plot held together.   NOT worth $30.  I'd consider it to be worth $20.\n\nI still recommend it for the story and characters.  It was fun to play through and I will prolly play NG+ one time through just to see what it's like and what changes.\n\nNote:  Despite seeing alot of reviews referencing the Neptunia series, I've only played a few hours of Rebirth and hated it.  There are similarities in gameplay, but the story here isn't a bland piece of s*** built solely for comedic effect and wrought with plotholes.  I do give kudos to the Neptunia series for actually presenting me with at least some gameplay challenges, though.","September 16, 2015","true","41.9"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Considering the achievements (of which many are rediculous), the game is expected to be played through multiple times (NG+).\n\nFYI : TLDR at the bottom.\n\nStoryline - 8/10 - Actually has a clearly explained plot line.  Some plot twists and variation of character. Very comedic.\n\nCharacter Development - 7/10 - The intereactions b/t characters is fun, energetic, and sometimes realistic.  Very few of the character's personalities evolve.\n\nGaemplay - 6.5/10 - The bar for the difficulty lvl is set way to low.  It's not in the least bit hard.  I expected at least some challenge.  I'm not counting the lvl req'd DLC dungeons(which aren't plot related and aren't req'd to be completed or even played at all), that's a cop-out.\n\nAt least fairies could be used to modify the stats of any given dungeon.  So if you just wanted things to be hard, you could make it so no spells/ablilties can be used, chars take dbl dmg, have reduced resistances, can't cure debuffs, etc.  On the flipside, +% exp/gold/WP/stats/droprate.  Most faires gave both a (+) & a (-).  Still didn't improve overall game difficulty.\n\nBattles are easy to learn, manage, and fun to watch. Quickly becomes repetitive.\n\nEquipment was too easy to come by to bother making it with mats. Level growth was automatic boosts to all stats, and the only variation is via equipped Fairy and Weapon Points (WP).  Don't get me started on the player specific abilities, that is a sordid story rife with complaints.\n\nOn the plus side WP had a good deal of variation, but alot of the magic/weapon attacks seemed either useless or overtly interchangeable with 2-3 others.  Why would I want to use magic to cure a debuff if there is an item for it?   Nothing in the game denies the use of items.  Granted AoE dispell of all debuffs was nice, but characters were only ever afflicted with one at any given time.  Not mentioning most were temporary or lacked any sort impact on the battle.\n\nIt was fun to make a bunch of items I'd never need or use, though. (Max Elixirs, the AoE HP pots, etc)\n\nSome people complain about the AoE targeting sensitivity being too high, but these people are just lazy. This is easily remedied by rotating the camera.\n\nGame Stability and Hardware Req'd - 9/10 -  Game has low hardware requirements but remains nice to look at.  Art style and quality gel together well.  Objects in the world look like they belong and doesn't have any obvious/jarring visual errors.\n\nLoses a point for poor dungeon initialization programming.  Major FPS drops everytime a new dungeon is loaded, due to all the mobs being spawned simultaneously.  Major programming bug that should have been fixed prior to port.\n\nVoice Acting and Music - 9/10 - To my surprise, the english voice acting was superb.  I'll probably play through the game again with the original voices to see how it compares, but not anytime soon.\n\nMusic was enjoyable for the first 10hrs or so. By then you've heard almost 80% of the music you'll hear all game and they're just on repeat.  Was nice that one of the battle specific songs was swapped out halfway through.  It was seriously grinding on my nerves, by then.\n\nTLDR\n\nOverall, I enjoyed the game.  The characters were entertaing to watch and the plot held together.   NOT worth $30.  I'd consider it to be worth $20.\n\nI still recommend it for the story and characters.  It was fun to play through and I will prolly play NG+ one time through just to see what it's like and what changes.\n\nNote:  Despite seeing alot of reviews referencing the Neptunia series, I've only played a few hours of Rebirth and hated it.  There are similarities in gameplay, but the story here isn't a bland piece of s*** built solely for comedic effect and wrought with plotholes.  I do give kudos to the Neptunia series for actually presenting me with at least some gameplay challenges, though.","September 16, 2015","true","41.9"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

"without the dlc's ofc's"\n\nAt the moment i bought that game i thought ..... damn what a crap and i'm really honest here, but after a while i really started to like this game and the Story itself is really nice, with a sweet plot twist.\n\nAbout the difficult of this game, it is not really that hard if you are a fan of RPG's or JRPGS, at some point u find yourself grinding for some ability's and it get's kinda boring, since u become way to overpowerd....\n\nSince i didn't buy the DLC's with the lvl Cap and so on i think there is still some stuff that is pretty amazing and fun, but if you only bought the game to play it the DLC's ain't needed at all, it is just a way to continue the grinding to lvl 1000.. with some extra Fairy's, and those ain't really needed to finish the game itself.\n\nAs a conclusion, this game is awesome, if you are the typ who likes animes and loves to play Final Fantasy or other RPG's give it a shoot since it is currently on Promotion sale u can't make anything wrong at all. The character's are created with love and u will feel it in every moment a sequence comes up for sure "not speaking about the wiggel factor from some female character's here when they morph...", the fairy's are funny and unique everyone has a own character this gives the feeling of collecting something unique and not like collecting stones or some kinda of crap where everything is identical.\n\nand for a end of this hand's down guy's and girl's we all know Harley is the best ^_^/","August 11, 2015","true","25.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

It's not amazing, it's not the best thing ever, it's simply what a game should be, fun and entretaining. It doesn't try to go beyond and break any new barriers, but it also isn't lazy or badly done.\n\nThe story is not really that special, but it keeps you engaged enough to keep on wanting to know what's going to happen. Not going to give any details because that would take forever.\n\n\nThe characters are stereotypes that anyone is used to see in any anime. Though the main character is by far the most entretaining character because he really does not seem to care for the main quest, not even for the other characters... to a certain extent. But his interaction with Eryn, and the rest of the group do make them more interesting then what they are in their roots.\n\n\nThe gameplay is redundant. It's always the same thing over and over again. Usualy this is a problem, except for the fact that the gameplay is rather fun, so it doesn't really matter. The special attacks feature some nice animations and the transformations get you really pumped expecially when you are fighting a boss.\n\nThe music complements the game nicely and the world in itself is rather charming.\n\nOverall this is a really nice game that will make you want to play it for hours and hours. There is alot of stuff to do like side quests and other fairies to find, skills to upgrade, etc, so you will always have something to do.\n\nIf i had to rate, i would give it an 8/10.","August 22, 2015","true","20.8"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/harag6/recommended/347830/","harag6","Harag","http://steamcommunity.com/id/harag6/","103 products in account","When I started to play with this game my first impression was along the lines of:\nGod These characters are annoying!\nThe main character Fang acted like a lazy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ who cares about nothing but food. The main heroine and the face of the game Tiara acted like a giant SOB. The other heroine and the partner of Fang Eryn always seemed to have a few bad words for him.\nThough to be fair Eryn did have a reason to act the way she did. Just imagine you wait (for only God knows how much) for a lifetime partner to finally show up. And then when he finally arrives the only thing you get from him is verbal abuse, unwillingness and constant complaining about food. You wouldn’t be happy about it either would you?\nAnd then I kept on playing and the magic happened. When the characters started to really interact with each other and solving the problems life gave to them they turned out to be really well thought out and lovable.\nI would say the main strength of the game is it’s brilliant writing. The plot is the average the bad boys wants to resurrect the bad God the good boys wants to resurrect the good God but fortunately it’s written in an entertaining way. The characters are not only good but they keep on developing and they get rid of their initial annoying quirks. The story itself is not ground-breaking but has it’s nice touches and has a plot-twist around the middle I DID NOT SEE COMING!\nFor the actual gameplay:\nIf you played Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth 1 or Re;Birth 2 then all I say it’s exactly the same.\nYou enter dungeons from the main map. Inside them you control your assigned leader in the map picking up treasures and avoiding or hitting enemies. The actual battle system is turn based so when you are hit by one of them a battle sequence is initiated where your party fights against the monsters. When the battle is won you get back to the dungeon.\nInteresting take that you can’t change weapons since each character has to fight with the fairy he or she has a contract with. In exchange you have a weapon upgrade system where you can raise your characters stats, teach them new abilities and moves, skills and magic trough Weapon Point earned by battling. However thank to this system your usual equipment are close to useless and the mostly serve as fanservice. In the game you will gather fairies you cannot equip as weapons but they can grant buffs and add dungeon effects using a system called world shaping. With them you can make the game a little bit harder or easier depending on you.\nI think the biggest flaw of this battle system is that you became overpowered very very quick. After that battles are a chore instead of a challenge and the game becomes rather boring. The other downside is the quest system which requires extreme levels of grinding.\nThere are 3 endings available but there is little difference between them. One for Tiara one for Eryn and a normal ending if you chose neither. Tiara’s ending takes priority so avoid scenes with her if you want Eryn’s. You should chose Eryn by the way.^^\nThe game offers a new game+ too. Many content is unavailable in your first playtrough raising the replay value of the game even harder. If you are interested in missable content then there is two playable characters who cannot be recruited unless certain conditions are met and a bunch of time limited sub-events.\nAll in all I recommend this game for everyone who loves jrpgs and doesn’t mind grinding.\n","August 11, 2015","true","25.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Though where to start...\n\nThe game itself is filled with humor that will make you smile, the characters are loveable and I personally am loving watching the story unfold and the characters all coming closer together, one humorous anime filled step at a time haha.\nThe combat is what you would expect from a game VERY similar to the Hyperdimension Neptunia series (also worth looking into if you are not familar) so not much I can really say there. It's short, sweet, and very simple to learn. The English voice acting is done right, as what is expected from the developers of these wonderful games.\n\nOverall if you are wondering if this is a product worth purchasing, then in all my hearts honesty, of my own opinion of course, yes it definetly is worth buying. As I have gotten farther on the PC port then I was on my PS3, I have come to realize how much I have missed out on when it comes to the overall enjoyment this game has to offer.\nNow of course this game has it's faults (mainly which comes to combat for me) but they are for the most part what would you expect if you have played any other heavily anime styled JRPG. I also wanted throw out as an almost last note the game is very well optimized right out the get go like everyone else has been saying. Something that the developers of these games have been having issues with when it comes to their ports. Anywhos...\n\nI'll quit typing here as I know due to the lack of reviews I actually write... I'm not very great at them. But I sure as heck tried my best! Haha anyways like I mentioned, in my heart this game is a gem. I almost want to say this was a very underappreciated game that never really did get the love it deserves. So please if you're interested do purchase this game, As I can promise you won't regret it;)\n\n\nAs always I hope everyone is doing well and living life the best they can!

I'd recommend picking it up at 50-75% off, as you'll have a good time.\n\nThe battle system is pretty fun, but it lacks strategy. Just buy lots of SP healing items, spam your most powerful attacks and you're good to go.\nDon't forget to buy the new attacks on the "Weapons Boost" tab. Only realized you could do that in the second half of the game.\n\nThe story is enjoyable, with a cast of likable casts and fun interactions between them.\nBut the actual plot is kinda awful. It just keeps jumping between plot points and never develops any of them. Doesn't help that this game loves to introduce antagonists just to kill them right after.\n\nThe worst thing about this game is that, in the first half of the game, the main character and his fairy partner are going to travel back in time, and they have to do everything again. Familiars with the Neptunia games should known that those games loves to reuse dungeons over and over again, so this is kinda of a "clever" way to do it. I still hated it.\n\nReally solid PC port; worked great on my machine, and it even has an option for borderless windowed mode, which is nice.","August 9, 2015","true","22.1"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","6","13","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sorathecrow/recommended/347830/","sorathecrow","sorathecrow","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sorathecrow/","225 products in account","Fairy Fencer F is a lazy game, with a weak plot, that can be pretty fun if you catch it on sale.  I'm a little caught on whether to upvote or downvote, the flaws are SO numerous with this game, but it is still pretty enjoyable.  I'll tell you now, the game is very much average in my book (50-55% or 70-75% depending on what you consider "average").\n\nFirst I'll address my "lazy" comment: why is the game lazy?  First, the battle system is just a tweaked version of what you may very well have seen five or six times before in the company's "Neptunia" series.  If it ain't broke, I'm certainly not going to tell them to fix it, though, because they might make something decidedly less inobtrusive.  As it stands, the battle system is fairly enjoyable, you're given some freedom in picking which Persona *cough* I mean, Fairy to use, which augments your stats and grants you certain bonuses and debuffs that might effect your adventure through a dungeon, like an exp bonus at the expense of having lower defense, more money but harder enemies spawn, etc.  As you earn experience, you also earn secondary exp referred to as "WP," which you can apply to the stats of your choice (if by choice, you mean adding extra attacks in battle through leveling Combo!).  Battle play out very....slowly...as characters have played out attack animations and the game requires a lot of loot farming to finish missions, luckily, this is rendered much less annoying by the fast forward button they let you use to skip animations.  Of course, a fast forward button is a bandaid solution to the greater problem that battles take very little strategy and the whole gameplay rythm relies on a lot of menial drudgery.\n\nSide quests are lazy too.  Most of the missions in the game are shoved into a quest board with scant flavor text that is only really worth reading for the location and enemy information that it might (emphasis *might*, the times when it doesn't give you useful information are always on the rarest, most difficult-to-find items) provide.\n\nDungeon design is also...you get it by now.  Mostly corridors, with minimal interactibles except for the odd enemy or treasure...floating cube thing that very thoroughly fails to blend in with ANY scenery you happen to find it in.  Locales you visit have no real significance.  Go here for that MacGuffin, then go here for the next one, etc etc.  You could have flipped the order of most of the dungeons in the game and it wouldn't have really changed anything.\n\nThe plot is weak for a few reasons: the world, the characters, and the pacing.  First, the world is very shallow.  You have one hub town, and it's just a bunch of menus (Neptunia players will not be surprised by this).  There are NPC talk events that come up regularly, but most of them are either useless random comments about really nothing, like a drunk passing by or something, or vaguely silly scenes where an NPC does something weird and your character reacts to it.  World building is pretty much non-existant, except to further drive home the heavy-handed and simplistic world the main plot already sets up.  Main plot establishes really quickly: evil corporation appears good, but is really doing bad stuff!  Side NPCs occasionally: we love the evil corporation so much because they throw money at us, etc.\nSecond, the characters.  The characters for the most part sit very comfortably in shallow archetypes that they don't venture out of very often.  Even with fairly frequent talk topics after major plot developments, you never really see how the group becomes the True Companions that are willing to die for the main character despite his less than stellar charisma and lazy attitude for most of the game.  It doesn't help that the game resets about half way through, resetting character development for everyone except the main character in the process, and further shortening the character arcs (if you can even call them that) of the party members.\nThird is the game's issue with pacing.  The fact that the timeline resets mid-game reeks as an excuse to reuse the already minimal-effort dungeons.  Indeed, after that mid-game reset, the game introduces about a handful of new dungeons, that might as well be reskins of the existing ones anyway.  This move also resets character development for most of the cast, turning the focus on the main character as he tries to convince them he isn't crazy and really IS from an alternate timeline.  If their motivations for joining the party weren't ALREADY flimsy (pervy researcher girl wants to come along so she can perv on your party's female fairies), they become seriously flimsy after the reset (hey, this crazy guy claims he's from the future, might as well tag along and perv on his fairies while I watch this play out).\n\nPositives and Negatives Breakdown:\n+Great port: Borderless windowed option, runs smooth even at high resolutions and at max detail.  No crashes, no save issues, works competently on keyboard+mouse, but best on a controller.\n+Fun, if mindless dungeon crawling: the gameplay is fine.  The story can't really stand on its own, and there's little narrative or lore motivation to doing sidequests, but if you enjoy the gameplay, it's an alright treadmill to get on for a few hours.\n+Good art--CGs in story events and character side-events are well done, frequently putting characters in pervy situations if that's your thing.\n+/- Music--there are a few standout tracks, but it's mostly very bland and forgettable.\n-Weak story\n--Weak pacing\n-Weak Characters\n-Weak world-building\n-Recycled dungeons out the wazoo\n","December 19, 2015","false","44.2"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

Anyways this secondary fairy will give you stronger and more passive buffs the more you train them because they do indeed level and I believe cap at 10 though they do take a bit more EXP than most characters.\n","September 3, 2015","true","43.3"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Main diffrence being you don't get to change weapons but you upgrade them with wp and unlock the moves like that instead of just leveling. The second is the shaping mechanic. You can put unused fairies into a dungeon and can get vartious boosts like more exp or more damage but get a negative effect in return like take more damage and stuff like that allowing you to customize dungeons the way you need atm.

Not really an interesting story.\n\nThe combat is turn based.\n\nYou get base stats + with each level up, along with WP after each fight (Weapon Points to choose to increase i.e p-atk, m-atk or tons with other upgrades and perks/skills),\nYou can "god craft" fairies to tune them to your best use, either be it combat where you quip one that gives you bonus skills and stats, or the special world shaping effect which each fairy will give. You can choose for instance gain 30% more exp, but again lose 10% P-ATK. Or get 50% more WP, but spells costs 2x more to cast. It all differentiate from which "sword/craft" you took from the goddess to boost you fairy.\nEvery fairy you shape comes with one good and one bad perk, so you can for instance earn way more exp/gold/stuff with an aggressive setup, and at normal, you will find out quickly that this game is rather easy, and you want to go all offence.\n\nThe crafting/synthesis is simple, not many materials and patterns, and its easy to find specific materials.\nThe music is also very good and dynamic in combat, it really hits the first times when you "fairize"\n\nThis game is rather unique, and I found it overall highly enjoyable, although the story a bit cliche.\nWould love an even more mature and unique story in the future.","September 26, 2015","true","27.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Yes it is similar in a lot of ways to the Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth series but it is different enough to set iself apart and I like that it is more relaxed in a number of ways.  The story is okay, nothing group breaking but the gameplay is solid and I haven't found any bugs.  To me the main thing is that it is fun and bug free and is very solid JRPG.  I highly recommend.  I have had a lot of good time playing it tonght and had to pull myself away from it as I am going to have a long day tomorrow.

You can't save in your main base of operations, only in random caves infested with endless baddies that are out to kill you?\n\n...Goddammit. There isn't even an autosave feature.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ZuruXu/recommended/347830/","ZuruXu","ZuruXu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ZuruXu/","68 products in account","After reading other reviews, I realize that this game could have been amazing if it hadn't been created in Neptunia's shadow. Personally, I didn't care for the HDN games and never got too far into them because the story/characters didn't really interest me.\n\nAs for this game, I really loved the characters (except Sherman, more on that later), the artwork is fantastic and it had a nice concept. Even the english VAs aren't too bad though some of the deliveries are poor and the fairies don't have voices in the english option without a workaround. The major downside is the game play.\n\nThere's a mechanic in the game where you pull out swords from either the vile god or the goddess using the power of fairys. The furies allow you to obtain abilities and add bonuses to dungeons.\n\nHere's the thing though..Whether or not you pull the furies out of the beings has no impact on the story at all. So the games main mechanic and purpose is basically just pushed off to the side and when you do pull out all the furies you get a wimpy boss that's no different than the end boss.\n\nIn fact, If you want any challenge to the game, try not pulling out the furies after the first required to open new dungeons. I had actually skipped the tutorial telling me about world shaping and it didn't occur to me to put more than one fury into the ground until Zepla valley and the only reason I even bothered to at all was for achievement purposes.\n\nThat's right. The game is extremely easy if played how it was intended. My first play through was long because I read the story and I ended up playing through two more times because I missed a subevent for a fury piece required to unlock the second to last fairy. These three play through took me at most 30 hrs...So why do I have over 80 hours of play time? Freaking button mashing the last floor of Sudokoos tower while watching tv for the steam achievements.\n\nYeah. That's right. I did it for the achievements. If I had picked this game up on the PS I wouldn't have cared but seeing those last character achievements locked just bugged me and since I knew I wouldn't be playing this game again I made the dire mistake of saying "what the hell" and deciding to just unlock these useless grindy, boring waste of time achievements.\n\nNow, as for my dislike of Sherman. His role in the story is useless. He is revealed to be the games main antagonist but he could be replaced by Bernard and the story would've been better. It's revealed that the Vile God's descendants destroyed his family so he attempts to take over the vile Gods powers for..what? It would've been far better if he had joined Fang in his mission to protect Tiara and revive the Goddess. On top of all that, somehow being rid of the vile God for good turned into only resealing him and both God and Goddess end up as they were at the start of the story.\n\nOverall, if you want to pick up this game, do it from a bargain bin and do it for the story and characters. Nothing else. I got this game when it was on sale for 55% off and I'm glad I did because it's definitely not a 30 USD worthy game.\n\nI really wish this story/concept had been done in a Tales of Series style. I would also love to play these characters again in a better game, perhaps a sequel.","October 18, 2015","false","83.6"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","2","6","0","0"

Also, you might've noticed I played this game for over 40 hours but I'm not reccomending it, and well, the reasons for that are explained below, if you want to read them.\n\nFirst of all let's start with the gameplay, it's the usual IF dungeon turn-based combat in which you have certain characters to select from and you make a party of maxium 3 and go beating up monsters and leveling, and all those other elements you'd expect to usually find in a rpg. The combat is alright, and the controls aren't that bad either, considering the guys that made neptunia made this it's bound to be good right...\n\nNext let's talk a little about the story and characters. The story is so blend it makes me puke, it's the usual ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t there's an evil God and a good Goddess and you must revive the goddess and stop the guys who want to ressurect the God, and all that nonsense, seriously, the plot is also a mess, and they try to squeeze in all these elements inside just to cover up for certain plot holes. The easiest element that can do this for you: time travel... And the ending is exactly what you'd expect it to be if you have this kind of stories.\n\nWell, you might be thinking, okay, if the story is bad, maybe the characters might help. Well, the characters are so typical, and tehy're the sterotypes of anime, which is what I hate the most about games such as this, unoriginal character concept is seriously a turnaway. You've got a typical lazy mc who wants to do nothing, two main love interests a tsundere and a yandere, the usual loli, the big boobed chick that's there for fanservice and don't get me started on the fact that there's a cat that talks or whatever that thing is. Now, don't get me wrong, the characters are what they are but there is certain plot development.\n\nNext, let's go in detail about the music and voice acting. The voice acting is decent, I would say good, but that's still not enough to sell this game for what it is, considering the music feels repetitive and every song feels like the other, seriously I'd rather listen to my own songs than to the ingame music at some points.\n\nThe final element I'd like to talk about are the achievements, and how insensitive some of them are. Now don't get me wrong, getting the achievements is not a matter of skill but rather a matter of time in this game, with that being said there are a couple of achievements which are if not impossible, then they would take about a couple hundreds of grinding without using any dlc. And even with the dlc they would still take tens of hours to achieve.\n\nPluses:\n-decent gameplay\n-well implemented turn based combat\n-good voice acting\n-skippable animations\nMinuses\n-overused plot\n-stereotypical anime characters\n-repetitive music\n-mindless grinding\n\nAll in all Fairy Fencer F is not a bad game, neither a good one, it's in the middle and everyone can have an opinion about it. Seriously if not for the story and characters this would be a game to remember, but as it is of now, it's all about the grind, and even if you are to finish grinding you would still feel like you achieved nothing...\n","February 28","false","48.5"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Having grand aspirations on becoming something more than your  parents were, following your own path in life and trying to enjoy yourself within the best of your ability. You would run around at recess playing basketball or playing in the fake metal castle and jungle bars that you gotten hurt from time and time again. Coming home to a warm dinner and greeting your parent or parents and having them ask about your day. The polar opposite could occur, you could have been that weird kid that everyone use to avoid and the teachers didn't know what to do with, you would sit recursively in the corner of the cafeteria, and talk to yourself inside of your head. You would pack a lunch that you made yourself, or if you had lunch tickets that would have to satiate your appetite until the next day, because your family was too poor to offer you any type of sustenance.\n\nNo when you came home, it was usually to a house of yelling and throwing things, your mom could have been a junkie your dad an alcoholic and the many brothers and sisters you have, were all so ♥♥♥♥ up beyond belief, they were never home. Your mom could have various men over to feed her habit, and sometimes these men would molest you, and so would your father after a stupor. This type of child had no chance in life. These children are brought into the world to do nothing but suffer. They play escapism in their minds to ease the pain that they are in. The only remedy for them would be to take them out of that hostile environment and place them with a truly kind family.\n\nChild 1 would exhibit some issues, but for the most part he would live a pretty decent life, giving the fact he/she would have the social skills and the support that they need to push on through. If not brought up properly they would proceed to become entitled and have this persisting narcissistic personality disorder. Nothing would ever be enough and everything that bad ever happened would be others fault.  So while both children would have these things in their minds growing up, child 1 for the most part would be extremely more likely to succeed instead of child 2, who would developed a multitude of mental illnesses, where they couldn't cope with for the rest of their lives.\n\nI have witnessed both of these things growing up, while attending school. You could always tell the children who were damaged and the children that had a pretty much life of leisure. I fall somewhere between child 1 and child 2, a mixture of real bad ♥♥♥♥, and real good ♥♥♥♥. A loving home, but also a broken home. A sheltered childhood, rampant with violence and chaos outside, filled with children growing up way to fast, and running dope on the street, like it's some sort of normalcy for them. My house was filled with a lot of fighting, arguing and general malignancy from many family members. A loving mother, grandmother and aunt, protecting me from the harms of the real world and the neighborhood. I spent most of my childhood indoors in front of the TV playing video games that my mom or grandmother would rent for me at blockbuster, I had a five dollar a week allowance that I could spend on whatever I wanted.\n\nWe were very poor, but we always had the lights on, food on the table, and a roof over our heads. My mother and grandmother would buy me the latest consoles even if I had to wait a bit, they would put layaway's and surprise me at birthdays and Christmas, my mom would write little sayings in my book bag for valentines day saying how much she loved me, and my grandmother would always cooked what I wanted for thanksgiving and Christmas. I had many good memories and many bad memories, but these three women always tried within the best of their ability to always make sure that I was always taking care of. I always had new clothes throughout the school year, and I always use to go to parks with my aunt because as said earlier the neighborhood was too bad to venture outside. I was hated throughout elementary school because I wasn't like most children. I use to get terrorized on the bus and made fun of because my hobbies included listening to music and playing video games. I was picked on for being overweight, and for being to proper and respectful.  Teachers were always antagonistic towards me, because I was the kid always questioning things, as to make them feel like it's more work for them, as oppose to enlightening a young mind.\n\nI would go through middle school and high school pretending to be something I am not. I would dress in my own style that consisted over various name brand clothing, I would always get the latest shoes  and colognes and I would put of this mask of someone who is wealthy and happy. I gave my mom and grandmother a lot of stress during this time, we didn't have the money to keep up this image and I would get into fights with them about it. I was popular, I hung out with people who made quadruple my mothers income, they would ride around in Mercedes and BMW, while my mom had this rinkydink Buick from the late 80s. I was ashamed of her jobs that she took to support me, and ashamed of where I lived and the cars that my family had. I tried everything to the best of my ability to make sure no one found out. I was loved, people knew who I was, they wanted to be me, they wanted to be able to be what I was. Girls were actually intimidated by me, come to find out later on, the reason I had such a hard time dating was because of the fact that these girls didn't think I would take it seriously and feared rejection.\n\nI'm not tooting my own horn, I began to hate what I have become, what I was, what I was turning into. It was fake, I was a fraud, I was everything every kid wanted to be in middle school and high school, but I was horribly depressed. Until one day I couldn't take it anymore, and It caught up to me. In the middle of high school I had an immunity disorder, for some unknown reason I would get sick every week. I missed more than a 120 days of school. I had bronchitis, mono, flu, strep, pulled groin, dislocated knee, walking pneumonia, I had it ♥♥♥♥ing all. During this time my grades were awful, I mean they always were terrible, but they really tanked. A little after summer, and after 9/11 I didn't attend school, I was majorly depressed and wouldn't leave my room, by this time I moved into a better neighborhood and things were a bit different. Like I said though, I stayed in my room all day and finally I was expelled for missing too many days. That was it, it was over, my so called friends forgot about me, and my popularity meant jackshit. I would suffer from this for an obscene amount of time.\n\nFrom that point on things didn't get better they just got worse and worse. At the end of 2011 I was hoping for a better year, I've been reclusive and working the job I still work at till this day that I hate, but at the end of 2011 I was hoping that I would finally have a good year, that this is the year that I would make a change. 2012 comes in, off to the same start as any other year, my grandmother had her 75th birthday, and I was as close as ever to her, till late March, where she got sick, she was hospitalized and had two mini strokes and passed away, 2013 would come and my uncle would be hospitalized with the same issues my grandmother had, he would last one more years and die in October of 2014. Every year since 2012 had been the worst years of my life, 2013 was particular horrible, but that's a bit too personal to get into, so lets just say it was just purely awful.\n\nIt's 2016 right now, and I am terribly unhappy, and have difficulty living each day. My heart is broken to a million pieces because I miss my grandmother and uncle so ♥♥♥♥ing much. So take it from me, just live life the best you can and share it with others who cherish and deserve your love.","February 24","false","2.2"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

I liked the Anime style comedy and dialogue, but the combat and progression just didn't keep me interested.\n\ng-Rating Categories:\n\n>>gameplay [1]\nThe game is basically dialogue and combat. There is no exploration really. You unlock different areas of the map as you progress, but they are stand-alone dungeons. The dialogue was great as was the Anime-style humor, but I couldn't get into the combat. It's turn-based inside an "encounter" arena that lets you move around to position before attacking or performing some other action. I think a more traditional turn-based RPG encounter mechanic would have been better (no movement) because the camera got in the way and honestly I didn't find the positioning to offer much variety from a strategic perspective. It was basically move >> attack, move >> attack.\n\n>>graphics [2]\nThe dungeons were very bland and generic, but the cutscenes and character art were awesome.\n\n>>gui [2]\nI played with a keyboard mostly. Although there were times when I had to use the mouse because sometimes keys were not mapped to some actions (like selecting a character to heal).\n\n>>glitches [3]\nSolid. No bugs.\n\n>>gasp [1]\nI'd rather watch an Anime.\n\nBest possible score is a [3.2].","January 2","false","4.6"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Small map and short gameplay as expected from the same creators of Hyperdimension. Multiple endings not too complicated but alot of grinding is needed like usual.

Full price...eh, maybe?\n\nEDIT: Now that I've actually spent some real time on this thing, here's a better overview.\n\nThis game has relatively interesting battle mechanics and character advancement, without getting high off the smell of it's own flatulence like SquiEnix loves to do.  (Un)Fortunately, it is a loving testament to Shonen.  For those of you who aren't familiar, Shonen can be summed up as the (metaphorical) pre-pubescent boy navigating the hazards of middle school.  I felt the game was relatively well done, especialy for Shonen, and it managed to mostly avoid the obnoxious pit-falls of the genre.\n\nUntil the Thing. I forgot that modern Shonen also brings forth The Thing - the vaguely anthropomorphic not-an-animal which exists only to irritate the ever living hell out of anything with two brain cells to rub together.  An example of The Thing?  Exaclibur.

The issue is that they drew up these maps in about 30 seconds and said “we’re good to go!”   By the way I just checked and this game came out originally in 2013! WTF! Xenoblade Chronicles came out in 2010 and for an inferior console and it looks about a billion times better than this!\n-\nExtremely simplified turn based combat, it’s all about keeping healthy and doing more damage, no crazy strategies here. If the game wants to give you a tougher boss they don’t actually come up with an interesting boss that will keep you guessing, instead they just do more damage and take less damage, quite simple and uninspiring.\n-\nA story that on paper seems like they could have done something good with it but in reality there is no story here, just an intro, and a bunch of clichéd fan service crap and cookie cutter bad guys.\n-\nOh, btw, there’s no walking into towns, digesting beautiful sceneries, exploring and adventuring, etc.  Oh no, this game was made in power point, it’s just slides of text after slides of text with anime girls in questionable outfits and when you think you are done and you can go out and explore the world, all there is for you is a menu and several options to choose from before going to your next lame dungeon, there’s not even a real world map. There is but you can’t walk around it and fight monsters in it, it’s just a screen where you move a cursor to pick which dungeon to go into.\n-\nThere is one thing that does make this game playable (barely) and that is the dialogue. 99% of the dialogue in this game is excrement but that 1% can be hilarious in ways you haven’t laughed in a game for a long long time.\n\nMy recommendation is don’t buy this horrible excuse for a JRPG and buy The Legend of Heroes Trails in The Sky instead (it’s on steam and it’s an incredible, incredible game)\nBut if you must play it, do yourself a favor and buy the armor pack DLC that costs less than a dollar, that way you can breeze through bosses and finish this game as quickly as possible so you don’t keep hurting yourself.\n\nOH, and a very important thing. If you are like me, married with family and happen to play your videogames at night when the wife sleeps, on the big screen TV with headphones, make sure she is very deeply asleep because my wife wakes up in the middle of the night and sees the tv and goes “oh, playing the witcher? Cool, have fun!” and goes back to sleep.\nIt’s not cool when she wakes up and sees cartoon gigantic boob dangling around the screen.\nScratch that… 13 year old gigantic boobs and then looks at you with a “did I marry a serial killer ♥♥♥♥♥♥ pederast Hitler?!?!?”\n\n\nAVOID PAIN, AVOID THIS GAME.","August 11, 2015","false","14.5"," 14 of 37 people (38%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","38","14","37","2","1"

Once one figures out how to skip around the majority of useless talking then it's not half bad.\nThere are several key point which should be made however, key among them is the rather lacking travel system and places to explore. City navigation was reduced to a menu rather than walking around a city or town itself. The dungeons were repetative and by most game standards highly incomplete. I would even go as far as to say that the game itself is incomplete. There are many, many opportunities to miss things which one would think would be required to actually complete the game. This also doesn't even factor into account that your main goal is to pull all of the swords out of this goddess, of which you can't even achieve on the first play through. There is no real rpg aspect to the game as you do not have any real choices to make, you cannot influence the real out come of the game. The ending is set, though they did offer three different ones based on one conversation only (which means, you either talked to this person or that, not giving you a choice in any conversations is what this game is all about it seems).\nThere are only two ways to make playing and fighting in this game slightly enjoyable and relaxing. The first is to cheat with some form of hex editor and modify your xp and skill points. The second is to spend hours upon hours of grinding. The story line is a B at best, maybe a C+, it's nothing short of what a middle school student could have written for a short story.\nThe fighting system was passable, but left no room for diversity or customization of characters. The best thing about this game was the few tid bits of costume which you could place on different characters.\n\nFor my rating I will give the following on a 1-5 scale, 1 being the worst:\nGraphics 3\nGame play ease 4\nRpg / options 1\nStory line 2\nReplayability 1\nDiversity 2\nOver all 2\n\nIf you want some thing quick and lacking thinking then this is right up your alley. It requires no brain power or creativity what so ever.","August 12, 2015","false","55.2"," 7 of 23 people (30%) found this review helpful","30","7","23","0","1"

These don't make this game bad by themselves, but because they are not implemented in any stand-out way, the game overall feels only mediocre.\n\nThe first 20 hours of the game are decent, as you constantly obtain new party members and dungeons to grab your interest. However, after those initial 20 hours, you reach a point where the battles and dungeons start to constantly repeat themselves, and even though the story is far from over, with so few unique things to hook you to the game, it eventually becomes a boring grindfest.\n\nI really wanted to like this game, but I just can't as it doesn't bring anything new and exciting to the table, just recycles familiar genre traditions, with nothing but a bit of polish and very little charm.\n\nI won't recommend it to you unless you crave for about 20 hours of decent content (about a half of the game), and find it at a very steep discount.","August 10, 2015","false","31.0"," 16 of 44 people (36%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","36","16","44","2","1"

You just get VN-style talking heads.\n\nYou know how in most jRPGs dungeons feature gameplay other than random battles, such as solving puzzles and discovering interesting lore and useful items? Nope. Dungeons are extremely bland here. At least not as far as I got, which may not be a lot, but it's the point where most other games in the genre have opened up a bit.\n\nYou know how RPGs are defined y the characters you meet, and so most strive to have good ones? Nope. So far all the characters have been so incredibly onedimensional, it's almost criminal.\n\nYou know how the plot is *the* most important thing in an RPG? Noooope. No plot here. At least so far. Move along.\n\nAll in all, buy something else.","August 11, 2015","false","9.4"," 11 of 35 people (31%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","31","11","35","0","5"

Don't buy this game -  You like grindfests? then buy this game.\n\nThe characters themselves are created extremely well, to the usual highest of standards and fit well within the storylines.  Fang though comes across far too whiny in the early parts of the game though but at least, the other characters are hilarious especially Eryn and Tiara who no doubt will replace Nep as someones waifu.\n\nTiara and Eryn both are amazing characters, the voice actors do really amazing jobs in capturing their often hilirious quirks, such as Tiara strange kinky responses when shes verbally assalted by fang.  Both character design is perfect,  the other characters are all fairly well balanced too but don't nearly stand out as much as Tiara and Eryn.\n\nA great game but has a really poorly designed questing system which forces the player into loading/reloading dungeons countless number of times in order to get rare drops in order to synthesis stones to complete rank quests, these quests are extremely grindfest and incredibly frustrating especially if you get unlucky with crappy RNG, and to make matters worse these Collector Quests just get worse as you rank up,  Rank C is pretty bad - I shudder to think how bad Rank B and A will be,  but these shouldn't be designed this way - Compile Heart you disappoint me here,  you're better than this to throw in a really unnessary grindfest in order to progress your questing.\n\nSome stones are somewhat 'easy' to find with Item Sonar as they as the potential areas are close to the entrance, like with the ice cave so the re-loading of the dungeon isn't so bad, but other dungeons on the other hand, the hidden treasure could be far away and that takes a significant amount of time finding the hidden treasure, and thats even 'assuming' its not a useless sprout inside.    Basically, if there is a DLC or any cheat/feature that clearly displays the hidden treasure on the map immediately without having to use item sonar, then this is clearly NEEDED in order to keep your sanity after your 1000th dungeon reload and you still haven't gotten your stupid stones yet.\n\nClearly, this quest system just doensn't work very well at all, and unfortunately this heavily impacts the games fun factor once the tedium sets in.  Compile Hearts, please do not do this again with future releases - stick with the tried and tested methods that worked with the HDN series.\n\nAs for the rest of the game, I haven't had any issues - everything else is good.  Good characters,  good story lines with humorous dialogue and the voice acting is up to high standards.   The graphics and drawing are on par with the HDN series.\n\nWhilst I honestly enjoy the game, and story - I just can't get past the mistakes made with the quest system, and thats the only - repeat ONLY reason for the not recommend review.   *IF* you don't mind a more hardcore approach to grinding and farming, especialy farming for stones so you can synthesis then you will enjoy Fairy Fencer F,  if your like me and have no patience at all these days for farming and/or get easily frustrated then I would do more research first before buying into this game.\n\nClosing statements here is that the worst problems that Fairy Fencer F suffers from are insane grinds require for portions of the game, especially in farming for stones and stealing quest items which have a very very low success rate.   Another minor issue is that halfway though the game, the difficulty unusually spikes with monsters doing alot more damage, plus you'll face more in battles + boss battles get more intense, I'll not reveal anymore information on this because it'll potentially spoil it for anyone reading, but the spike feels like it wasn't tested enough and makes an already grindy game, feel even more grindy.\n\nAlot of content is also highly missable, such as recruiting extra characters which first time around, is more or less impossible and really aimed at NG+ so expect to play through multiple times in order to unlock alot of the extras.  Finally, if anyone doesn't believe me about the drop rates being really bad - just check the forums yourself and read all the posts regarding this - Don't take accept anyone saying that they are 'fine' because they are clearly not.\n\nWhilst reading through my review and reading through peoples responses, I think I came off as highly critical.  I make no real apologies here since everyone has their own right to post how they feel about any game they play, whether its a hateful comments or because they just really love the game and cannot stand any negativity.  However,  I think I was wrong to give this game a 5/10 and I will admit, that was a mistake - however, my previous statements I will still standby them.\n\nOverall 6/10\n\n++ Slick combat system\n++ Good WP system for developing characters skill and abilities\n++ Cute and Moe Characters\n++ Great Storyline and Dialogue\n+++ Music Score by legendary Nobuo Uematsu\n\n- Highly missable content\n-- DLC heavy\n-- Too much emphasis on farming\n-- Some side quests and synthesis feels grindy\n---Major grindfest in certain areas of the game\n---Collectors quests has a long and unnecessary grind","August 5, 2015","false","20.5"," 60 of 179 people (34%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","34","60","179","7","41"

Being an enthusiast about Anime didn't have anything to do with my review. I will say that this game is incredibly detailed. The developement of the characters was meticulously thought through and the interactions of the characters don't change for the sake of story developement. All characters are very different and very in personality. The idea of time and it's affect on the world when the particular sequence appears is actually quite accurate. Any change in a timeline can have the potential to change everything about the time stream that you currently travel which is why I believe it was a well thought out paradigm of the story. With the inclusion of the choice of Good or Evil makes this an interesting blend and includes several even more interesting character interations. Players don't necessarily have to grind to finish the game, but it does certainly help. The idea of overkilling enemies has always been a thing for me and with the DLC added to the game, adds the possibility of total annihilation. Getting certain materials to create new weapons, armor, items, misc. items, and other synthesis materials is difficult but if it were easy then it wouldn't be worth the effort. The synthesis items are much stronger than what you can buy and If you farm the materials then it is worth that much more. I would say to be careful about the boss battles when reviving the God or Goddess. If you have the DLC it is easier than normal, however once you reach a certain rank they will start getting though your armor so don't rely on the DLC to last you the whole game. It wont. Overall I recommend this game to any and all RPG enthusiasts out there even if you don't like Anime. It is a rich story full of spontanious and often hilarious conversations. I enjoy the game and I hope anyone who has just gotten or even just thinking about getting it will too.","October 25, 2015","true","43.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ZalotAngel/recommended/347830/","ZalotAngel","ZalotAngel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ZalotAngel/","237 products in account","You can see my full review here:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AZ9A9Iazpg\n\nIdea Factory, it seems that they can't get away from making there games similar to Hyperdimension in almost every aspect, at least that's what it felt like to me after playing several hours of Fairy Fencer F. The game is as Turn based JRPG that follows the standard premise for JRPG's but does a few things different from the sandard.\n\nI'll start with the story, the idea is that two gods (The vile god and the Goddess)had a falling out and paralized each other with each others swords. The swords that missed ended up in the world, embedded in the ground waiting for a capable human to pull them out. When someone pulls one out, the Fairy within the weapon is bound to them at that moment and it allows the person to weild incredible power. These people then become Fencer's, people who can weild these weapons and the fairies within them. Almost every goal for a Fencer is to collect 100 Furies (The weapons with fairies) and pull all the swords out of the goddess and in doing so, they will be granted a wish. So yeah, it follows a very obvious premise to JRPG's, having Gods, a single corporation that turns out to be evil behind the scene's and so on. So the story isn't very original in it's idea but it does do a couple of things different then other JRPG's.\n\nNext is the combat and if you've played any of the Hyperdimension Re;birth games then it's going to feel very similar, and by similar I mean it's the exact same as the Re;birth games. You have up to three characters on the battlefield and you move each one when it's there turn within a specific area. You can start off with a basic attack which will start your combo for that characters turn, but you start off with only one and have to increase your combos by aquiring them with weapon points. Just like Hyperdimension you can switch you attacks anytime you want for different one's which allows you to mix and match a lot of different attacks to find one's that go together. Your skills contain two catagories, Skills and magic. Skills are a combination of magic attacks with physical attacks and Magic is pretty self expainitory. Next is Fairize, this is your characters transformation allowing them to use the power of there Fairy to increase there stats and gives access to a unique skill. To access the transformation, there will a bar connected to the characters portait in the top right corner, when this bar fills up (By taking damage or dealing damage) and glows blue, you can access the transformation which gives the character an increase in there physical  attack and defense, but will start to decrease if you take damage. The transformation is nice but it can be turned off so easily that it'll barely last for a couple of turns if your getting beat and the increase in stats is quite minimal that you probably might not even notice the difference. Next, every character has a unique ability tied to them that they can only use, Fang has serious face (Well named there) which gives him a big increase in physical attack by 2.0 but his base attacks cost SP and his skills SP usage will also increase by 1.5. Tiara has a protective barrier that will only pretect her but can withistand really strong attacks and Harley has the ability to scan enemys and exposse there weaknesses. At the end of it, it's rather slick and fastpased, the animations look really smooth and the partical effects and skills look really good, the transformation could look better though.\n\nThe one thing I've always praised Idea Factory for is the art design. Be it with this game or Hyperdimension, the character models, the sceneary and the enviroment look beautiful and very well done. They're always so full of color and never look over designed.\n\nOn to the last thing that really kinda takes me away from the game and that is the characters themselves, I find it very difficult to stay interested in a game where most of the characters are so unbearable that I want to punch them in there face. I'll start with our main protagonist Fang, an egotistic, big headed, arrogent, slightly selfish food lover. It's difficult for me to find a place for me to start with him since I have a fair amount of problems with him. The things he's says seem only to elevate his own opinion of himself and has a distinct habit of down right insulting the other characters for no reason which makes it very difficult for me to feel anything for him when he acts like that. The rest of them have a habit of responding to a situation or each other in the most piculiar way that doesn't really make any sense, but some of them have had effort in putting personalities into them. It is nice however to see a male protagonist who isn't a cliced angsty teenager but the way they did it doesn't make him likeable in many ways, An example I can give for a good male protagonist in a video game is Yuri Lowell, I recommend looking for yourself why but I digress.\n\nYou may have noticed that I've been comparing this to Idea Factoy's other game Hyperdimension a lot and that is because it is practically the same game but with different characters and setting. The problem I find however, if I where to compare it to Hyperdimension, is that it doesn't have the charm or the personality that Hyperdimension has. That has many different characters with different personalities that suit there character designs for one, the other being that it just doesn't care, it will constantly break the fourth wall, refence other games and hardware, poke fun at the game industry and at animes. It has that charm to it that makes it enjoyable and fun to the point where you'll spend hours paying attention to the dialogue just to see what they'll reference next and what thing within the game industry they'll poke fun at, I mean come on, at the begining of Re;birth 3 they reference the Oculus Rift and Sword art online by creating a device called the "Nepulus gift" (Something like that) and having it looking exactly like the Nerv gear. The list goes on and one with what they'll do.\n\nI digress, I'm here to review this game on it's own, I compare it to other video games to give you general comparison of what I'm talking about. On it's own however, without comparing it, it it's fairly enjoyable to a certain degree. The art style and character models are beautiful, the combat is fast pased and fun once you start getting more combo slots and skills and the enemy variety is nice, but there are a couple of things that I've been nitpicking about just because it's me and I tend to point out every little detail. So I can recommend this if you haven't played any of the Hyperdimension Re;birth games or if you want something that's a little more serious, but it can be enjoyable if you look past the small nitpicks.","August 7, 2015","true","8.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MMPD/recommended/347830/","MMPD","Sir MMPD Radick","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MMPD/","699 products in account","While not the most original RPG out there it does have its moments. They did a decent balance of humor with the story albeit very predictably. The ferrize thing though is just way over the top, but ignoring that and the fact they did it that way on purpose for the story and humor it is worth playing. I mostly enjoyed the interatctions between Tiara and Fang. And the side story with Apollonius wasn't bad, but I wish they did more with it. Don't get me started on the weird guy in the animal suit... Story wise the main complaint I had is the way the handled the main town. The conversations with the locals were all pointless and did not really endear you with the story, but personally I felt like I had to read it in case there was some subplot that would show up.... sadly they did not really take advanatage of that and no quests from any of the common characters ever occured.\n\nGameplay itself is pretty mediocre. Reason I say that is because really pretty much through 95% of the game I was just spamming attack + skip, ferrize + skip, attack + skip. This game definitely did not focus on strategy. Most of the time I got through battles without losing any characters because I just focused on stunning the monsters with combos so I would end up getting the game to trigger the event to get other party members to get a whack in. This even worked on bosses. I would generally advise not to buy the DLC that provides the armors unless you want to have two characters be nearly invulnerable for 60-75% of the storyline game. I'm telling you those armors are way overpowered! Don't get me started on the other DLC's where if you want the stat boost at all your characters are in towels?!?!\n\nNow the one thing I really do have to say was a decent idea for the battlesystem and that was the combos mechanic. It really did let me choose a moveset that I could get the maximum amount of damage. The main problem with the combo system is due to how much time it takes to play thing game (and how much I was spamming skip) I ended up only using the same moveset over and over and ignoring any of the other possibilities because 90% of the time the moveset I chose for the A button worked, so there was no reason to choose any of the other choices. I never really used any magics at all except for healing as it wasted more time than it was worth in most cases.\n\nLastly the questing system at the bar is seemingly pointless. The amount of griding that is needed is rather sad. The rewards do not even cover the time spent on the task in many cases. Once you get to the C important mission I was stuck for a long time because I didn't check to see if there was a way to synth the ingredient.. figured I would pick it up somewhere.... wrong.\n\nBottom line I would rate the game as a C\n\nStory C+\nGameplay D\nAmount of Gameplay A-\n\nIf you're bored I would recommend it, but there are better choices out there such as "Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky, The" etc.","August 8, 2015","true","23.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Unlike the NepNep games, I actually hadn't played FFF when it originally came out. So, where to start...\n\nFor starters - if you like anime - this is probably more up your alley than NepNep. It has a much more serious tone yet still retains that sense of humor. It reads well. The plot is (mostly) solid. All-in-all, it was enjoyable.\n\nI like all the characters. Fang shows character development. Something which is largely absent from NepNep. Tiara and Eyrn do as well. Actually, all of them show character development. I guess that's part of what I liked too. Fang goes from a lazy bum who just wants to eat ♥♥♥♥ to a guy who gets ♥♥♥♥ done. As far as characters go - my favorite list goes something like Ethel, Eyrn, Tiara, Fang, Harley, Pippin...\n\nThis game leaves quite a bit unanswered. If you're an inquisitive sort, this game will wreck you. I find myself wanting to know some details which just weren't explained. Which is to say, most things don't leave me wanting answers. I'm hoping the sequel sheds some light on these.\n\nThere are some negatives. No game is perfect, of course.\n\nSome battles felt forced and lacked sense. I'm largely referring to the forced losses, which I feel it would be better if they just did story segments for some of them. With FFF, half the time I destroyed my MP meter only to get obliterated next phase when I actually *can* win the fight and it isn't a forced loss. It's too hard to tell the impossible battles from non-impossible. For example, before the final battle, the Marianne fight. During forced loss, she has three dots. You get her down to one, and then it RESTARTS, and she has six dots on her meter and it's Fang only. Seriously. Kinda unfair.\n\nTL;DR - Best thing I played this year, but does have some flaws. Oh, and Ethel is the best. Also, Pippin = Excalibur\n\nNote - I'm a Linux user, and I maintain the AppDB page for FFF on WineHQ. This game doesn't work perfectly on Wine at the moment. If you have a Windows computer, just do yourself a favor and buy it. It'll work well on Wine sooner than later, and you shouldn't skip this.","August 22, 2015","true","33.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

All you'll get is a static background image for each ending, which will contain like five unique dialogue lines, completely unsatisfactory and bland compared to what the story was being so far. Get one and watch the other two on YouTube, there are plenty of non-commentary gameplays showing only the endings in Auto mode.\n\nDespite my tremendous disappointment with the ending, the game is solid and worth replaying at least once, since NG+ isn't exactly the same as the first playthrough, there are a couple of surprises in there. I recommend it, especially if you're a grinding maniac who wants to get to level 999 and collect every item, you'll get a lot of hours of entertainment for the price while rarely getting bored.\n\n8/10","August 16, 2015","true","29.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Mediocre and completely soulless. It's not bad and it's hardly good either. It's average, ordinary, undistinguished, middle-of-the-road, lackluster, forgettable and other synonyms related to second-rate.\n\nCharacters are common stereotypes found in many Japanese media directed towards teenagers such as in animes and mangas. Here's some examples:\n\n1) The "hot-blooded but borderline mentally ret-rded" MC.\n2) The "cutesy but sometimes annoying" female lead.\n3) The "tsundere pseudo-noble lady" rival of female lead to be the best girl.\n4) The "one who exist solely as fanservice" supporting female lead.\n\nThere are a few more characters but if you're familiar with animes and mangas, then you can guess for yourself what kind of character they are. Don't bother getting attached to them either. All of them are one-dimensional. ALL OF THEM.\n\nStory is juvenile and uninteresting as it has already been done countless times in other JRPGs. A completely average main character "accidentally" became the hero. He gains the responsibility to save the world by collecting "something" to "free the God(dess)". Main villain appear, so does other unimportant and boring side characters, hero formed a party, went travelling, stuff happens, some "plot-twist" happens, hero got defeated briefly but the power of friendships/love gave the hero strength to defeat the "real" villain and the end. In other words, been-there-done-that. No effort was put in the story at all. I personally lost interest during the middle of the story and pretty much rushed through the ending. Sorry to say it didn't get any better. In fact, it got worst. Oh, can't forget the fanservice. Think of the poor basement-dweller players if we didn't get any fanservice.\n\nCombat system was acceptable, for the first hour at least. After that it's down hill. Despite having a number of different types of combo to execute like in Xenogears (one of my favourite JRPG of all time) and Radiata Stories, most of them became obsolete as players are forced to use only a specific amount of those combo in battles. And no, you can't change them during battles. Meaning you have to use the exact same fighting animation on every battle. Throughout the WHOLE GAME! Magics and skills are useless as normal attacks are more efficient. While you can transform into a stronger form in battle, it gets tedious doing so in every battles. Get use to the skip button 'cause you'll be using it a lot to skip the 10 seconds animation with the super cheezy song every time you transform.\n\nLook, I could go in detail why I don't recommend this game but that would be a waste of my time. Just trust me on this, if you're expecting a masterpiece with a engaging story, memorable characters and a fun gameplay, look elsewhere. If you're really desperate in playing this mediocrity, at least buy it on sale. Don't waste money paying full price for this.\n\nNOT RECOMMENDED","October 16, 2015","false","20.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I can't remember the last time I power played an RPG as thoroughly as this one.\n\nI have gone through two playthroughs already and going for a third to get my last ending. Japanese and English voice acticing are amazingly done, though if you choose to hear the game in Japanese you will be treated to some extra voiced content when viewing some Sub-Events back in town. While the game is not punishingly difficult and never posing much of a challenge with the main storyline, there is a degree of challenge present in the sidequests to keep things from being a boring button masher.\n\nWord of advice to completionists not wanting to miss anything on their first playthrough, upon entering a new dungeon and viewing the cutscene, leave immediately and go back to town and accept Lola's quests as they are time sensitive. Try to fight every enemy you see at least once, inspect the maps throroughly to look out for diamonds containing possibly missable loot and obtain the Item Sonar ability as soon as you can.\n\nOverall I recommend this game highly to any JRPG fan that is into a good story filled with likeable characters with a great balance of drama, action and comedy.\n","September 19, 2015","true","55.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

All you'll get is a static background image for each ending, which will contain like five unique dialogue lines, completely unsatisfactory and bland compared to what the story was being so far. Get one and watch the other two on YouTube, there are plenty of non-commentary gameplays showing only the endings in Auto mode.\n\nDespite my tremendous disappointment with the ending, the game is solid and worth replaying at least once, since NG+ isn't exactly the same as the first playthrough, there are a couple of surprises in there. I recommend it, especially if you're a grinding maniac who wants to get to level 999 and collect every item, you'll get a lot of hours of entertainment for the price while rarely getting bored.\n\n8/10","August 16, 2015","true","29.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/chaoskagami/recommended/347830/","chaoskagami","Nyan~","http://steamcommunity.com/id/chaoskagami/","144 products in account","This was the best game I played this year, hands down. Unlike the NepNep games, I actually hadn't played FFF when it originally came out. So, where to start...\n\nFor starters - if you like anime - this is probably more up your alley than NepNep. It has a much more serious tone yet still retains that sense of humor. It reads well. The plot is (mostly) solid. All-in-all, it was enjoyable.\n\nI like all the characters. Fang shows character development. Something which is largely absent from NepNep. Tiara and Eyrn do as well. Actually, all of them show character development. I guess that's part of what I liked too. Fang goes from a lazy bum who just wants to eat ♥♥♥♥ to a guy who gets ♥♥♥♥ done. As far as characters go - my favorite list goes something like Ethel, Eyrn, Tiara, Fang, Harley, Pippin...\n\nThis game leaves quite a bit unanswered. If you're an inquisitive sort, this game will wreck you. I find myself wanting to know some details which just weren't explained. Which is to say, most things don't leave me wanting answers. I'm hoping the sequel sheds some light on these.\n\nThere are some negatives. No game is perfect, of course.\n\nSome battles felt forced and lacked sense. I'm largely referring to the forced losses, which I feel it would be better if they just did story segments for some of them. With FFF, half the time I destroyed my MP meter only to get obliterated next phase when I actually *can* win the fight and it isn't a forced loss. It's too hard to tell the impossible battles from non-impossible. For example, before the final battle, the Marianne fight. During forced loss, she has three dots. You get her down to one, and then it RESTARTS, and she has six dots on her meter and it's Fang only. Seriously. Kinda unfair.\n\nTL;DR - Best thing I played this year, but does have some flaws. Oh, and Ethel is the best. Also, Pippin = Excalibur\n\nNote - I'm a Linux user, and I maintain the AppDB page for FFF on WineHQ. This game doesn't work perfectly on Wine at the moment. If you have a Windows computer, just do yourself a favor and buy it. It'll work well on Wine sooner than later, and you shouldn't skip this.","August 22, 2015","true","33.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I must say I was a little worried when I got sent back in time. I thought the game "Yeah, you got sent back in time and you gotta do everything over again so you get girl." And boy, was I wrong. I mean the general idea is still revive the Goddess but with the way the story was written, it seems like it's actually sub-plot. That said this is the story of a lazy boy named Fang who prefers slack off in bed or eating Bahus' cooking and he is roped into reviving the Goddess by circumstance (and lots of peer pressure). And that's basically the gist of it.\n\nOnto gameplay. At first glance I thought this game would live up to the brutal difficulty of Re;Birth but it sadly didn't. However, I later realized that the game was designed to be played a certain way. And that is by stabbing furies various place in the world map and making use of what is called "world shaping". Let me give you the quick rundown. World shaping is an ability that fairies use when they are stabbed on the ground. They have a certain radius that are dictated by their level. Let's say that a fairy has a world shaping ability of -10% P.DEF and +10% M.ATK. This means that every creature in that dungeon (including you) have their physical defense decreased by 10% while all magical attacks are 10% stronger. There are various world shaping effects that help increase damage (taken and delivered), boost WP, experience, and even seal off skills which is accessable through Godly Revival provided you have the necessary fairies.\n\nOverall, I really love the amount detail put in the making of this game. Both story and gameplay wise. All characters have these quirks that make them stand out and provide an entertaining experience. There are some sexual innuendos, as well. Only one actually.

To be fair, I've had my playthroughs of final fantasy and other rpgs, so to me, this turned to be more interactive and strategic than most . There's plenty I like about the game, but a few others I dislike. I'll start with what I like :D\n\nPositive\n- Funny, not too many games that introduce a humorous cast of characters actually make me smile and laugh.\n- Beautiful art style and anime, characters look and act how they were made\n- Easy combat system, items, attack, combos and spells pretty generic but very satisfying to see those combo strings and multiple damage hits\n- Basic but fair storyline, very generic and simplistic story to follow and understand\n\nNegatives\n- Rushed, many of the characters are thrown into your way and then into your party about 2 minutes after you meet them without even really understanding why or who the hell they are\n- Repetative; its a very simple system: go to town, events, buy info, free swords, go into dungeon, grind/complete quests (repeat) the side quests and events are really the only thing besides the storyline you can do\n- Very short dungeons (also a pro) The dungeons are usually consisted of less than 5 areas, you can complete the main quest in a matter of minutes\n- Protagonist (also a pro) I may get anime people jumping on back for this lol: the protagonist made me laugh and he does grow and develop throughout the game, but its just a hero I cannot get behind and makes me strongly dislike him later in the story. The early part had me laughing, but later on had me facepalming, honestly I wished  Sherman was the main protagonist, thats my opinion though lol.\n- Brief tutorials, while most people generically know what their doing; its a little bit of a slap in the face that Eryn's tutorials pop up for like 3 screens going ," yeah this is how you do this and this, good luck finding  these matierals yada yada. " The game doesn't tell you where you can get specific items or materials.\n\nI still play the game and I still haven't finished the main story, so I'm no expert whatsoever; however this is a very fun game to play and kill time. The art style, the graphics and the gameplay are very fun . I'd play this when you get a lot of time and feel for a simplistic set back style game.","August 14, 2015","true","9.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I can't remember the last time I power played an RPG as thoroughly as this one.\n\nI have gone through two playthroughs already and going for a third to get my last ending. Japanese and English voice acticing are amazingly done, though if you choose to hear the game in Japanese you will be treated to some extra voiced content when viewing some Sub-Events back in town. While the game is not punishingly difficult and never posing much of a challenge with the main storyline, there is a degree of challenge present in the sidequests to keep things from being a boring button masher.\n\nWord of advice to completionists not wanting to miss anything on their first playthrough, upon entering a new dungeon and viewing the cutscene, leave immediately and go back to town and accept Lola's quests as they are time sensitive. Try to fight every enemy you see at least once, inspect the maps throroughly to look out for diamonds containing possibly missable loot and obtain the Item Sonar ability as soon as you can.\n\nOverall I recommend this game highly to any JRPG fan that is into a good story filled with likeable characters with a great balance of drama, action and comedy.\n","September 19, 2015","true","55.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

All you'll get is a static background image for each ending, which will contain like five unique dialogue lines, completely unsatisfactory and bland compared to what the story was being so far. Get one and watch the other two on YouTube, there are plenty of non-commentary gameplays showing only the endings in Auto mode.\n\nDespite my tremendous disappointment with the ending, the game is solid and worth replaying at least once, since NG+ isn't exactly the same as the first playthrough, there are a couple of surprises in there. I recommend it, especially if you're a grinding maniac who wants to get to level 999 and collect every item, you'll get a lot of hours of entertainment for the price while rarely getting bored.\n\n8/10","August 16, 2015","true","29.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a bit sad with the lack of Harem end, but doesn't stop you from playing it~ haha~ Now aiming for the Eryn and Normal ending. It just feels that it should have a sequel~ Hope Compile Heart work on it soon~ Anyways, good job to the devs for making this game! Very nice graphic designs specially those animated Fairize sequence, and the soundtrack matches very well too~ Totally recommend this game to those who also love anime style characters and visual novel style storytelling!

The screenshots this product had, did not please me, as it didn't show much in my opinion, so when going to youtube. I just watched the intro of the game, and Fang, the main protagonist, hooked me into buying it with his attitude. It was so hilarious i had to check it out for myself.\n\nIn doing so, it was the best RPGs I have ever taken the time to play. Without going into much detail, I will let you know the pros and cons of of this game.\n\nPROs:\n-Great Battle System\n-Hilarious, yet epic and touching storyline.\n-Great graphics both in and out of battle.\n-Side quests and other missions to collect bonuses\n\nCONs:\n-You may need to LVL grind in some areas depending how often you avoid battles.\n-There could be more areas to explore and make the game longer, but there aren't\n-SOME but not all, side quests are too tough and require a ton of searching.\n\nBut overall, if you are a fan of Final Fantasy or any other RPG and have time for a couple of laughs and like having a good time, this game is the right one for you!

Attack positioning is irrelevant (no additional damage for back attacks) and special skills aren't that useful. Pfft.. skills. P-atk FTW.\n\nStory is good. Half-way thru I literally dropped my controller when Tiara died. Characters are amusing and the banter is good.

However unlike the HyperDimension series Fairy Fencer F takes on a slightly more serious approach to their story. The game's combat is a bit repetitive and that's the only complaint I have with the game (its combat system is quite similar to that of the HyperDimension series), however what really drew me in to this game are the whacky characters, particularly the lazy main character Fang. There are some good laughs to be had here and if you love the HyperDimension series then I can HIGHLY RECOMMEND this game to you. If you're not a fan of those games however then honestly you may not like this one either, unless it was the characters in HyperDimension that turned you off.

Noting I just want to point that out.\n\n"JRPG" used to be better in my time. They used to focus on much more serious story and well written. Everything that make absolutely sense and very depth in decision. This is called "traditional" JRPG. A game with truly masterpiece, a wonderful tales tell that beyond your imagine and memorable. Unlike "Modern" JRPG which is focus on satisfying a otaku and weeabo's want with cute girls and anime tier concepts, but with a few gameplay input.\n\nFairy Fencer is one of game that tried to walk in traditional part but also with modern JRPG featured in.\n\nBut technically still not enough. As you can see, the trend has changed. People are more likely to look at JRPG as some kind of anime fan service in which you only need some cute girls and some cute personality to gain scores, this game is also one of them that get overrated just because they have cute girls and a few cool epigrams. I never expect anything serious from this company since they're the same group who make Hyperdimension Neptunia in which is even more focus to this modern trend and make a sell on top of it.\n\nI never find it surprise if some people never like this game.\n\nBut at least Fairy Fencer F tried to walk a game in a right way.\n\nThe way of presenting story in this game is a same of that Visual Novel game. The main plot of this game is about help the good and destroy the bad kind of story.\n\nAt a beginning, this game is kind of slow and mainly just common silly anime scenes you can find elsewhere nowadays. A lazy overreacting main character and a female character who is intently made to have silly personality for a sake of cuteness but they also intently make a scene in which try to present that this silly girl has hidden past, pretty much standard. I honestly think they shouldn't present their characters this way, it's kind of silly and stupid, this is where they start to lose score for traditional JRPG. But I also can see why people like it, because they expected this kind of story to be a same as anime, aka for a sake of fan service and kawaii overdose. Instead of trying to make characters good with decent past and story, they simply just make a character silly enough to be adorable, this very reason cause some characters to be too bland and too simple while some characters are downright waifu tiers. A Balance between characters are just worst, they overly present some waifu tier characters while leave a lot more other characters in full of mysterious or they simply don't give a decent backstory or anything like at all, thus unfortunately becoming some bland characters which have been put in for a sake of various in combat party.\n\nDue to slow in story progress, and very silly way of presenting characters, many people has desired to refund this game and call it a boring game, which is 50% true. Because later in game, this JRPG has turned into decent traditional JRPG like they want it to be. Characters are becoming more serious, less silly jokes, more determine and almost no fan service at all. I, personally feel like I was playing an old game at that point. You'll get excited after that boring and stupid part and you would enjoy this game and never want to quit till the end. Too bad not all of people who have bought this game can reach to this point before getting too bored.\n\nIn my opinion. I would give a 6/10 for a story because, while it's beautiful and good written, they have to input all those silly scene and stupid waifu stuffs just for a sake of winning a weeaboo and otaku's hearts. This game could be much better, they shouldn't walk in traditional part with this. They don't need it. They can keep their style with cute girls like these but they don't need to make them silly like for sake of cuteness, they should make them like a real person.\n\n\n{Gameplay}\n\nA standard turn based RPG, you take turn to do some action. For example, attacking or using item. This game also including special abilities which divided into two type of attack; Skill and Magic. Or it be looked as Physical Attack and Magic Attack. Character's power determined by Level which will determine the overall character's stats. There're also a few more ways to improve character's power as well such as completing character's challenges or invest a point called "WP" in weapon boost. There're several stats in this game for example HP SP STR AGI VIT and many more etc.\n\nAs far as game goes, I, honestly find it kind of straightforward, you level yourself enough to beat monsters, and if not then you need to level yourself up enough to beat them and you have to repeat that until the end of a game. A Battle is kind of straightforward as well as every monsters, including boss will simply attacking you until you died, all you need to do is to prevent that from happen. In short there is no much need for strategy, all you need is better stats and skills.\n\nI honestly also find that I barely use Skill and Magic, I find out that normal attack is much more powerful and easily chain with crazy combo, which enough to take out boss in one go. It's either an overlook in combat design in term of balancing player's characters or the monsters/bosses design are simply bad. All boss in later game proved to be no challenge which this is where they lose a score in gameplay. To put it simple, I killed a last boss in one combo with main characters. They really really need to rethink on how to balance this combat experience because other JRPG or RPG never have this kind of problem. If you expect combat to be some kind of challenge then you will definitely disppointed. But if you enjoy killing everything with your overpowered party and don't want to experience any kind of challenge which suppose to be in game then I will not stop you either.\n\nI will give a game combat 3/10; there're many flews in this and they're needed to be improved.\n\n\n\n{Visual, Music, Art and other}\n\nIn term of Anime Style, this is very well done, the art is memorable and simply beautiful. But there're also many reuse. A Character's visual design can live to expectation of otaku and weeaboo. A normal people who never like anime style may find it too weird. I honestly like this art style, they look really cute, and even male character look cool.\n\nDungeon design is not that special nor strikes you any impression. It supposes to be made like some fantasy beyond imagine kind of dungeon but it just lacks many depth to make it really amazing. Instead it looks like a bland dungeon with abnormal objects/features including. But they are beautiful though so I guess it's an ok design. You will have to revisit those place at least one or two times though. If I have to compare the size of world map and dungeon of this game to other RPG, this game is rather small to tiny, favor anyone who just want to progress story fast and those who want to grind an easiest way possible and don't want some maze kind of dungeon which take way too long to complete.\n\nMusic...they are good additional, some battle musics are pure addict, some emotional musics are fit as well, you will find one of them memorable and you probably ask where to find that music for your Music Player so you can listen again and again.\n\nA Visual of Skills and Magics are pure awesome, it's super fantasy and you feel like you're gifted with power. They're addict and you wouldn't mind using that again and again. Trust me, it makes you feel like a pure awesomeness. Other RPG almost never have this kind of experience for you.\n\nAn Overall score of these are 8/10. Which I expect no less from a game that based on Visual Novel but with RPG gameplay.\n\nI hope this can be a help of anyone.","December 28, 2015","true","47.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Since I'm been urging to play Hyperdimension Neptunia for awhile now why not try a game that's similar to it? After buying the game, playing it and having almost sleepless nights. I have come to the conclusion that this game is worth the money.\n\nThe storyline is good, it has some funny dialogues  (For example if you try to remove a piece of the seal from the so called Bringer of Destruction, you'll get two lovely ladies scolding at you. Not to mention one being a masochist)  and alot of other stuff. I don't wanna spoil anything you'll just have to see it for yourself.\n\nGameplay is also good, I'm pretty sure most of you have played simple turn based rpgs. Like you just choose the command and it does it. Well this isn't your simple plain old turn based rpg. This one has movements, that's right movements where you can actually move your character and then execute command bla bla bla. I'm pretty sure most of you has (have?) already experienced playing games like these with these kinds of gameplay. Anyway this is just my opinion and I'm not a professional at anything. Oh did I forget to mention that you can change the clothing of your characters? :3\n\nDLCS are optional if you want some early-late game boost.\n\nThe endings can be different.\n\n"Don't judge a book by it's cover"\nSame applies with games\nSo what are you waiting for? Try out this game and stop relying on these stinking reviews.\nNot all weebs play this, even an average person can play it.","December 2, 2015","true","57.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The story so far is great with amazing story. 20 hours af playing this game and i think the story still very far from ending so it really worth your money though i buy this on sale about $5 or so. If you like Neptunia series then you'll like this where they came from same developer.\n\nWhat I don't really like about this game is that you have to learn from net about monster, tactic, and what kind of attack that monster weak for. You'll get basic tutorial and stuff but it not really tell you what element weak against what element so it abit difficult for new player in RPG genre like me. And when you play with keyboard i just don't get it about why they map keyboard button like that because it's kinda absurb like you jump with backspace LOL, so i recommended using controller instead.\n\nBut overall I love this game so I recommend this game for you who like TBS game, visual novel story and anime style character.","December 4, 2015","true","42.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Doesn't take itself too seriously, good humor typical of anime culture. Random battles let you skip the victory sequence and you can go from encounter start to moving on the map again in about 6 seconds if you're one shotting them(take that PS1 era RPGs). Nice graphics, high framerate.\nI'm really glad I picked this up.\n\nQuick edit to add more about one of the above points - this is all around faster moving than is typical of JRPGs I've played until now. Every single combat animation down to basic attacks can be skipped by holding a button, going from world map to town and back again is so quick there's no moment of thoughtful hesitation before I do so, even going into menus and changing stuff doesn't seem to take as long for a screen fade as I'm used to JRPGs taking.","August 8, 2015","true","36.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But this is a spin-off game of Hyperdimension with same graphics and gameplay but have different element like character, story, item, and etc. If you thought this game is extremely easy, you can check Shukesoo's Tower Alternate Route but you must met Harley first to unlock the dungeon. but I recommend you to level up to 50 or more to challange the Alternate Route. Because it's really hard.\n\nYou can get the DLC if you want new model of the weapon, clothes, and some fairy pack.

I expected it to be some anime ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t that I might find amusing and I was curious about the combat. What it actually ended up being was possibly my GOTY 2015 and that’s not even a joke.\n\nInitially, Fairy Fencer F seems like it’s pretty much stupid ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t that gets by on being moderately amusing and has really anime jokes that are tired and obnoxious- a refined woman who’s slightly masochistic, a busty blond who’s too casual about nudity, the same ♥♥♥♥ you’ve rolled your eyes at a thousand times if you like anime. And at the start of the game, the combat’s nothing special either, as like most RPGs it has the terrible habit of not giving you many tools other than “press attack, maybe cast a spell if you’re feeling saucy” for the first hour of the game.\n\nWhat made me keep playing was the UTTER goofiness of Fairize (a sort of super mode you get) and the music that comes with it. Full Contact starts with the lines METAPHORPHOSIZE YOUR HEART, UNLEASH THE HELL INSIDE and doesn’t get any less ridiculous from there, and every time you Fairize there’s a (skippable, something I was grateful for by hour 20) magical girl transformation cutscene where you impale yourself with your weapon. The other thing was the ridiculousness of the protagonist Fang, who starts off as a lazy hedonist who’s only glimmer of a better nature is agreeing to help his fairy partner when she reveals that she’s lost her memory. The writing is genuinely enjoyable too, although early on is marred by the previously mentioned anime staple “jokes”.\n\nHowever, it only gets better. The battle system opens up, and while disappointingly I never felt challenged to prove my mastery of the combat system, it was still interesting and engaging to learn and improve at. The game’s one real flaw to me (aside from fanservice, especially with Harley) is it’s just too easy- a flaw that’s only noticeable because the battle system is so good you can feel that there’s room for real challenge outside of “my numbers are higher”. The story and characters meanwhile, skyrocket in quality, with everyone quickly becoming likeable, the main character having a real and noticeable character arc, and the tone seamlessly and naturally escalating in scope and gravity without ever having a jarring “when did the comedy end” moment. Even some of the tired jokes get used in actually funny ways, and the rest fade into the background or simply vanish.\n\nFairy Fencer F is legitimately a great game, which is the absolute last thing I expected it to be. I highly advise anyone who has any interest in RPGs or anime-y games to pick it up.\n\nAlso, it has accessories like in a Tales game, and that’s awesome. They’re also reflected in the transformation cutscene, as are alternate costumes (of which there are very few)\n\nLook at that goofy little plush. Buy this game, seriously, it’s good.","January 2","true","72.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a bit sad with the lack of Harem end, but doesn't stop you from playing it~ haha~ Now aiming for the Eryn and Normal ending. It just feels that it should have a sequel~ Hope Compile Heart work on it soon~ Anyways, good job to the devs for making this game! Very nice graphic designs specially those animated Fairize sequence, and the soundtrack matches very well too~ Totally recommend this game to those who also love anime style characters and visual novel style storytelling! The ending wasn't the one I was expecting but gives you a bit of sadness and happiness at the same time.

It's a lot, a lot, of conversations that are somewhat amusing, but the game does allow you to skip them if your not into the story and just like the combat or have already played through once and listened to the many hours of story already, it's always nice when games don't force the story on you (specailly when your playing through a game a second time). And the combat is Exactly like Hyperdimintion Neptunia which was an interesting idea, and enjoyable, but could be finiky aiming with controller and a bit less finiky but still finiky with mouse and keyboard.\n\nStory seems like most JRPGs, amussing but pretty bad at the same time, kind of like good bad movies for example the first Mortal Kombat movie was a bad movie but good at the same time because it was that cheesy bad.\n\nAll in all if you like JRPGs you will probably like this, but expect to get a bit frustrated trying to aim a conal attack at two enemies every once in a while but otherwise enjoyable combat, expect amusingly bad dialog (and a lot of it), and expect to have to grind in the late game (not certain on that, but most JRPGs end up grindy mid way through).","August 7, 2015","true","4.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MMPD/recommended/347830/","MMPD","Sir MMPD Radick","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MMPD/","699 products in account","While not the most original RPG out there it does have its moments. They did a decent balance of humor with the story albeit very predictably. The ferrize thing though is just way over the top, but ignoring that and the fact they did it that way on purpose for the story and humor it is worth playing. I mostly enjoyed the interatctions between Tiara and Fang. And the side story with Apollonius wasn't bad, but I wish they did more with it. Don't get me started on the weird guy in the animal suit... Story wise the main complaint I had is the way the handled the main town. The conversations with the locals were all pointless and did not really endear you with the story, but personally I felt like I had to read it in case there was some subplot that would show up.... sadly they did not really take advanatage of that and no quests from any of the common characters ever occured.\n\nGameplay itself is pretty mediocre. Reason I say that is because really pretty much through 95% of the game I was just spamming attack + skip, ferrize + skip, attack + skip. This game definitely did not focus on strategy. Most of the time I got through battles without losing any characters because I just focused on stunning the monsters with combos so I would end up getting the game to trigger the event to get other party members to get a whack in. This even worked on bosses. I would generally advise not to buy the DLC that provides the armors unless you want to have two characters be nearly invulnerable for 60-75% of the storyline game. I'm telling you those armors are way overpowered! Don't get me started on the other DLC's where if you want the stat boost at all your characters are in towels?!?!\n\nNow the one thing I really do have to say was a decent idea for the battlesystem and that was the combos mechanic. It really did let me choose a moveset that I could get the maximum amount of damage. The main problem with the combo system is due to how much time it takes to play thing game (and how much I was spamming skip) I ended up only using the same moveset over and over and ignoring any of the other possibilities because 90% of the time the moveset I chose for the A button worked, so there was no reason to choose any of the other choices. I never really used any magics at all except for healing as it wasted more time than it was worth in most cases.\n\nLastly the questing system at the bar is seemingly pointless. The amount of griding that is needed is rather sad. The rewards do not even cover the time spent on the task in many cases. Once you get to the C important mission I was stuck for a long time because I didn't check to see if there was a way to synth the ingredient.. figured I would pick it up somewhere.... wrong.\n\nBottom line I would rate the game as a C\n\nStory C+\nGameplay D\nAmount of Gameplay A-\n\nIf you're bored I would recommend it, but there are better choices out there such as "Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky, The" etc.","August 8, 2015","true","23.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In Neptunia I had fps drops under 20 here however it's constant 60 fps.\n\nI must say I was slightly disappointed by what felt to me like a rushed ending and overall length of the game. They could've definitely expanded the story in NG+ but that's unfortunately too much to wish for. Would've been nice to see some more dialogues between other members of the party and maybe some more backstory. This game really had a lot of potential.\n\nHonestly very mixed opinion but I did enjoy the game even if i had issues with it and I'll probably play a while longer.","August 8, 2015","true","66.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But I find that it challenges your suspension of disbelief.  As you continue playing it, you start to realize that the story can dissociate drastically from the gameplay.\n\nFor instance...on the first playthrough, I one-shot a boss.  Cue the upcoming visual novel cutscene where the characters are wincing in pain and groaning about how strong the boss is.  I reaaally didn't get that impression.\n\nSo my suggestion is that if you get the game...play the game and follow the story.  But don't play the game AND follow the story.  Treat the two separately, and I think you'll find that it's entertaining as a game and tells a fairly interesting story.  But if you treat the two as one unit, expect to lose some brain cells when the gameplay and story start hand-waving.\n\nThis game is a bit weird.  In an era of RPGs where you're able to allocate your stats as you see fit, this game sort of falls back to the traditional method of level-up = auto-allocate stats.  Granted, there is a way to boost your attack stats, but I dearly wish I could up my characters speed / accuracy.  Speed because I'd like to give a certain character in the party the ability to attack first.  Accuracy because there are certain attacks in the game that give 300% damage, but they miss really often.\n\nIt turns out that it's not so much that they miss often but that the enemy has an easy time dodging them.  I figured this out when I used these techniques on low level enemies...whereas I would have a 20% hit rate on equivalent level opponents, At level 55, I had a 100% hit rate on level 30 mobs.\n\nThe only way to boost the speed and hit rate is to complete a set of challenges.  These require you to do weird things like jump around as the leader of the party or send the enemy flying so you can use interception attacks.  They wouldn't be so bad ordinarily, but I do have complaints about jumping 5000 times per character just to max out the challenge.\n\nPersonally, I liked playing this game a lot.  I just wish that I managed to get the Eryn ending first try.  I don't know what I did wrong to get the Tiara ending.\n\nOh yeah, I suggest turning on Japanese voices occasionally.  You'll find that all sorts of things are voiced that aren't in the English Dub.  For instance, the Fury Fairies.","August 8, 2015","true","71.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The battle system is somewhat similar to the Hyperdimension Neptunia series, and there are lots and lots of skills and battle points and other elements that you can advance in to get stronger in the way you like. Depending on the play style, it might be necessary to grind a few times, but nothing to write home about.\n\nI had so much fun with this title, it is unreal. I loved the art, I loved the characters and their dialogues. The battle system is fun, but it shouldn't be the only thing to care about. I was mostly interested in advancing the story and enjoying all the adventures and dialogues between the characters. They weren't always in agreement but as the story progresses you don't want to ever lose any of them, even those who may have tried to kill you before.\n\nAll in all, especially if you like JRPGs or Anime, I would recommend Fairy Fencer F from the bottom of my heart ♥","August 13, 2015","true","24.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

So many extra things, but in reality, the normal weapon+combos+atk and a few mid-range special moves are everything you need.\n\nI only leveled to mid-30s, but the last bosses were probably slightly too easy, so don’t level past there if you want to keep it challenging. If you complete the furies you’ll be way over-powered!\n\nBut I was glad I didn’t have to grind much. There are mechanisms to add abilities to gain exp out of party and more rapidly, so I didn’t find myself grinding for exp or gold. You’ll go to a new area and almost immediately gain 4 levels by the time you reach the boss just fighting the normal spawned monsters. I did have to grind a little for WP (power ups) in an area that gave more of it, but I ended up wasting it on character magic or moves that were more under-powered than what they already had..\n\nOverall a fun and short JRPG. My only gripe would be the crap dialogue. It’s full of trite cursing that detracted from the overall story. It’s pretty hard to root for the protagonist when he’s calling women a b**** in every other scene—this is not an exaggeration. I don’t mind language, but it doesn’t even flow, like a child who just discovered a new /bad word/. Eventually I got the feeling the game developers are clueless how to write diaglogue—you can hire specific people to do that BTW. By Act II it’s much better, but it’s worth mentioning if you have children playing the game. The diaglogue exchanges would probably cause PTA moms to Fairize.","August 14, 2015","true","26.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Being an enthusiast about Anime didn't have anything to do with my review. I will say that this game is incredibly detailed. The developement of the characters was meticulously thought through and the interactions of the characters don't change for the sake of story developement. All characters are very different and very in personality. The idea of time and it's affect on the world when the particular sequence appears is actually quite accurate. Any change in a timeline can have the potential to change everything about the time stream that you currently travel which is why I believe it was a well thought out paradigm of the story. With the inclusion of the choice of Good or Evil makes this an interesting blend and includes several even more interesting character interations. Players don't necessarily have to grind to finish the game, but it does certainly help. The idea of overkilling enemies has always been a thing for me and with the DLC added to the game, adds the possibility of total annihilation. Getting certain materials to create new weapons, armor, items, misc. items, and other synthesis materials is difficult but if it were easy then it wouldn't be worth the effort. The synthesis items are much stronger than what you can buy and If you farm the materials then it is worth that much more. I would say to be careful about the boss battles when reviving the God or Goddess. If you have the DLC it is easier than normal, however once you reach a certain rank they will start getting though your armor so don't rely on the DLC to last you the whole game. It wont. Overall I recommend this game to any and all RPG enthusiasts out there even if you don't like Anime. It is a rich story full of spontanious and often hilarious conversations. I enjoy the game and I hope anyone who has just gotten or even just thinking about getting it will too.","October 25, 2015","true","43.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you enjoyed games like Neptunia of Mugen Souls, then you won't need to read reviews to see if it will be worth it. Just watch some gameplay and you'll know if you want to.\n\nThe game features a Fairy Link system, giving you more personality in your custimization of your character(s). If you want to have a tank, mage or maybe a strong damage per turn. The only real walking you'll be doing is in dungeons, so you don't have to sidetrack the towns in order to go everywhere before heading out. The final part that the game offers is its "Gods Revival" option. By using existing Fairies you can upgrade them once with a unique ability and World Creation stats used to powerup and powerdown your dungeon experience. These mechanics make for a unique experience, but offers only so much.\n\nBut what's good about the game?\nIt has some great soundtrack to accompany you through your experience. Every type of dungeon has its own unique BGM and you are welcomed with more than 1 battle track. The game is also easy to understand. The battle mechanic isn't hard to figure out, but unlike Final Fantasy X; which uses the same Turn Order for battles, there is little to take advantage of. The story is lovable and you get to enjoy many faces that develop (sort of) over the course of the game. It also takes advantage of the "cliches" of games. The side events are also very Japanese with their slapstick and airheadness and ecchi.\n\nAnd what's bad about the game?\nLike mentioned often it suffers from cliches. If you know a bit of gaming you'll be able to foresee certain events. The game also features a cast of 6/7 to 9 playable characters. If you are going for completion you'll use 2 of those at any given time meaning you have 1 spare seat left. The game also suffers from the lack of difficulty. You can get behind big time, but you can train yourself back in the game, but once you get ahead by a lot you'll breeze through the game with little to no difficulty. New Game+ also leaves you with EVERYTHING so it will be even easier. The game also features a huge world map that won't be used in any way and instead of more dungeons you'll get to play every dungeon twice, thrice or even four times. The battle music will also get on your nerves since they aren't memorable.\nLastly the biggest flaw for the game is its shortness and cryptic level. If you go for a straight playthrough you can beat it in 15 hours, no problem. If you want to go for 100% you'll have to consult a walkthrough because the game is not going to tell you anything about any unlockable or (hidden) items. The game has a lot of missables and I mean a lot, you'll probably end up playing the game twice or thrice to get everything + the 3 endings.\n\nBy the end if you read it you'll notice more bad things than good things, but that's because bad things stay with you better. I had a good time by the end of the game. The flaws are noticeable and could have been removed, but it's not hindering your experience. All by all I think it's still pretty fun to play. It's not New Game+ worthy though. The final verdict: It's just fun, nothing special but fun.","October 27, 2015","true","38.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I can't remember the last time I power played an RPG as thoroughly as this one.\n\nI have gone through two playthroughs already and going for a third to get my last ending. Japanese and English voice acticing are amazingly done, though if you choose to hear the game in Japanese you will be treated to some extra voiced content when viewing some Sub-Events back in town. While the game is not punishingly difficult and never posing much of a challenge with the main storyline, there is a degree of challenge present in the sidequests to keep things from being a boring button masher.\n\nWord of advice to completionists not wanting to miss anything on their first playthrough, upon entering a new dungeon and viewing the cutscene, leave immediately and go back to town and accept Lola's quests as they are time sensitive. Try to fight every enemy you see at least once, inspect the maps throroughly to look out for diamonds containing possibly missable loot and obtain the Item Sonar ability as soon as you can.\n\nOverall I recommend this game highly to any JRPG fan that is into a good story filled with likeable characters with a great balance of drama, action and comedy.\n","September 19, 2015","true","55.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In Neptunia I had fps drops under 20 here however it's constant 60 fps.\n\nI must say I was slightly disappointed by what felt to me like a rushed ending and overall length of the game. They could've definitely expanded the story in NG+ but that's unfortunately too much to wish for. Would've been nice to see some more dialogues between other members of the party and maybe some more backstory.

To be fair, I've had my playthroughs of final fantasy and other rpgs, so to me, this turned to be more interactive and strategic than most . There's plenty I like about the game, but a few others I dislike. I'll start with what I like :D\n\nPositive\n- Funny, not too many games that introduce a humorous cast of characters actually make me smile and laugh.\n- Beautiful art style and anime, characters look and act how they were made\n- Easy combat system, items, attack, combos and spells pretty generic but very satisfying to see those combo strings and multiple damage hits\n- Basic but fair storyline, very generic and simplistic story to follow and understand\n\nNegatives\n- Rushed, many of the characters are thrown into your way and then into your party about 2 minutes after you meet them without even really understanding why or who the hell they are\n- Repetative; its a very simple system: go to town, events, buy info, free swords, go into dungeon, grind/complete quests (repeat) the side quests and events are really the only thing besides the storyline you can do\n- Very short dungeons (also a pro) The dungeons are usually consisted of less than 5 areas, you can complete the main quest in a matter of minutes\n- Protagonist (also a pro) I may get anime people jumping on back for this lol: the protagonist made me laugh and he does grow and develop throughout the game, but its just a hero I cannot get behind and makes me strongly dislike him later in the story. The early part had me laughing, but later on had me facepalming, honestly I wished  Sherman was the main protagonist, thats my opinion though lol.\n- Brief tutorials, while most people generically know what their doing; its a little bit of a slap in the face that Eryn's tutorials pop up for like 3 screens going ," yeah this is how you do this and this, good luck finding  these matierals yada yada. " The game doesn't tell you where you can get specific items or materials.\n\nI still play the game and I still haven't finished the main story, so I'm no expert whatsoever; however this is a very fun game to play and kill time. The art style, the graphics and the gameplay are very fun . I'd play this when you get a lot of time and feel for a simplistic set back style game.","August 14, 2015","true","9.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game is a very good port and looks much better than the ps3 version with a reslution of 4k downsampled to 720 thanks to my gtx 760. The battle system is turn-based like neptunia but it feels fast and you can skip the attack and transformation animations, which are cool, via the L2 button in addition to the visual novel story parts. I found the game easy but a bit grindy if you want to get a secret character. The music and songs are very good and catchy. The characters are funny but the story in general is darker than the neptunia games. I would recommend this game to any jrpg or anime fans.","August 9, 2015","true","50.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game is similar except instead of jokes on video games, the industry with silly fanservice, it's silly JRPG story spoof with puns on that and ...more fanservice.\n\nIt's very very similar to Neptunia, characters you get have combos you develop over time and they can transform to gain abilities and perks. The game feels like it had a much, much fatter budget however. Supported by the fact they have some Squaresoft employees doing things like music and art. Animations seem better done, there's less stuff re-used (though I've already run into a enemy that was in Neptunia so, there's that to think about) more enemy variety, ally variety etc.\n\nThe convo's with the animated sprites are better done than Neptunia as well, they have different poses, more of them, more on screen happen and they're more lively.\n\nThe game is more grounded than Neptunia however, it's less off the wall and ...more 'normal' but it's still insane. It has more depth to it in it's gameplay overall and larger dungeons ...they're still nothing wildly complex but they're serviceable. Characters are more customizable with how you develop them by way of fairies being linked to them and where you put points into their stats.\n\nDon't expect deep complex story telling here, it's light hearted, silly and ...well one of the screenshots has a wierd green bear character, so c'mon. (haven't gotten that far yet) What I do like is, everything moves fast, or is skippable, so you don't get stuck watching an overly complex move for the 5th time, just hit LT/L2 and you're onto the next thing. Even convos can be skipped so you don't have to sit through plot you may already have.\n\nIt's good, certainly a fun game so far in my opinion.","August 11, 2015","true","7.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kurobin920/recommended/347830/","kurobin920","KuRobin920","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kurobin920/","60 products in account","Fairy Fencer f was beautiful. This is going to be a long review, so if you don't like reading, then the first sentence sums it up.\n\nI've played many RPG and JRPG games through my life, and most of them were pretty spectacular. Golden Sun, Persona 3 and 4, Pokemon (if that counts), Chrono Trigger, Fire Emblem: Awakening, and Skyrim, to name a few. So I'd like so think that I've seen all the odd's and ends of what RPG/JRPG games should feel like.\n\nFairy Fencer f had every good thing RPG's have to offer. The story, the art, the music, the characters, the combat system, the customization, the grind (maybe not good to some people), and most importantly for me, a DYNAMIC main character. I'll be going into details, trying to avoid spoilers since I always hover over them anyways.\n\nStory:\nFF's story seems basic at first. Two deity's, the benevolent Goddess and the vile Vile God, each fighting to take over the world. They both get sealed away, and the world is left alone all normal. Your quest is to collect Furies (sealed fairies) in order to revive the Goddess and get your wish granted. Seems prety run-of-the-mill, right? But then you meet your two protagonists, the unlikeable Fang and the sarcastic Eryn, and you quickly get pulled in by Compile Heart's signature comedic dialogue. And in classic JRPG form, a TON of twists happen throughout the game that make you upset, confused or heartbroken. They come fast and strike hard, leaving you devastated or driven enough to keep playing; to solve whatever just happened. The story is far from basic. It's a wonderful tale of treachery, love, heroism, justice and cookies. Oh and Pippin I guess...\n\nArt & Music:\nEverything in this game was gorgeous. The landscapes, the cutscences, the characters, even the menu's were well designed and easy to use. The music gave emotions to the dungeons and aligned with events in the story; mystery, excitement, regret etc. I will say that you'll be sick of hearing the word "Metamorphosize" halfway through the game, since it's the first word of the theme song that plays when you Fairize.\nI figure I should also mention Voice Acting since that was pretty great too. I used the English voices because I knew Christine Marie Cabanos was in the cast. There was plenty of emotion, and none of the voices were painful to listen to like Compa from HD (Except Pippin)\n\nThe Character's:\nI'm as much of a fan of your "Tsundere" or  "Onee-Chan" trope characters as the next guy. Heck, I played through Hyperdimension and found it enjoyable. For those of you who don't know, basically a trope is a stereotype, for example the "Rich girl with the annoying laugh". But there were only three characters I can think of that fit into a solid trope: Soji, Apollonius and (maybe) Zenke.\nAll the characters were so completely diverse, and their chemistry was amazing. You had the "Tsundo-masochist", "Jarl Ulfric the Baker", "Kill, Kill, Kill", and the "Japanadian". All the characters had interesting backstories, and you really felt like you were growing with them on their journey. Just not Pippin though.\n\nCombat/Customization/Grinding:\nThe game consists of an Overworld, a single Town, Goddess Revival and Dungeons (Shukesoo's Tower included). Similar to most RPG's, the dungeons are filled with non-random enemy encounters that trigger a battle sequence. You can gain the advantage outside of battle by hitting the enemy first (akin to Paper Mario).\nThe combat system is almost identical to Hyperdimension; turn-based strategy. You can customize your team in many, many ways. You can change combos, armor, Fairies, stats, formation, members, partners, accessories and even fighting styles (Turning a brawler into a gunner, for example). The only thing I was disappointed with in terms of customizations is that  there are only two costumes per character . Everyone gets a default costume and a bath towel/bathing suit (DLC, by the way), with the exception of Ethel, who has three.\nI love grinding in RPG's. Shoot me, I'm weird. But this game was special in that it was actually fun to grind. You can upgrade each character individually using points earned from battle. Tiara can either be an all-out magic user or a Glavie wielder, or a swordsman, or an archer etc. It's very fun to play around with different strategies. I never used Pippin though, so I can't give analysis on that...\n\nFang:\nFang get's his own section because I hated him at the beginning. If you've ever watched a Romance/ Slice of Life anime before, you've met Fang; Lazy, undecided and unworthy of the ladies he's surrounded by. But oh my word. That is all I'll say. Let him annoy you, allow him to get at you and then you will feel all the emotion I felt through this game. Amazeballs.\n\nIn conclusion!\nStory: 9/10 - Draws you in. Makes you think, work and FEEL. I got the ending I didn't want, so maybe I'll edit this later.\n\nGameplay: 10/10 - I love the mechanics. Dungeons, shopping for armor, grinding. The whole RPG shindig.\n\nCharacter's: 10/10 - Individualistic, lovable, and well defined. But Pippin...\n\nMusic: 9/10 - Electronic? Orchestra? J-pop? Rock? Yup, and it's all great. But one over repetitive song robs this of a 10.\n\nReplay Value: 10/10 - Hard Achievements, three endings I'm dying to see, and ridiculous character customization.\n\nOverall: 9.5/10\nThis game truly deserves to be among the great RPG games out there. Where Hyperdimension is niche and weird, Fairy Fencer f is a beautifully crafted masterpiece of a game that I would kill to play again for the first time. I highly recommend this game if you are a casual, hardcore or die-hard fan of RPG, JRPG or Anime games.\n","December 7, 2015","true","25.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A week ago, I chose to give a chance to the game, and I'm really glad that I did, because it was a unexpected awesome journey.\nLet's talk about the combat first: It's a turn-based JRPG, but you can move in your turn. Each character has a different attack range, and you move in your turn to reach the enemies to attack.  You can attack normally, use skills, magics, itens, escape, activate each characters special condition or Fairize. This last command can be activated when your tension gauge is full and it lets your character make a fusion with your fairy, making you temporally stronger and activating some special skills.\nThe normal attacks, unlike R2, only hit one enemy, despite the range of the weapon. Speaking of weapon, since your fairy is your weapon, you can boost the atributes and unlock skills, magics and normal attacks. For example, you can raise the amount of normal attacks you can perform in your turn, unlike R2 where all characters can attack 4 times and there is no ''skill tree'' to unlock.\nYou will collect more than 20 fairies in the game, and you can equip them to each character to make a resonance effect, and create some new abilities or boost some attributes in the equipped character. Since the story of the game talks about the battle of the Evil God vs the Godless, you can go to a certain shrine where both are pierced by many swords of different ranks, and you can use fairies of the matching rank to take away that sword in a battle and create a shaping effect on your fairy. This shapping effect will buff or debuff certain attributes or skills in the dungeons and some even change the enemies of those dungeons.\nEach character has some kind of achievement to complete, like ''Walk 1000m as the leader'' or ''Win 10 battles without taking damage''. Those achievements will raise stats like Agi, Str, HP, SP, etc. It's something that it's not present on R2 but it's now present on R3.\nLeaving the combat mechanics behind, let's talk a little about the story and character development. Since Fairy Fencer F it's from the same creator as Hyperdimension Neptunia, and Neptunia it's a game with a lot of jokes, without taking itself too seriously (except if you take a specific route in R2 that it's dark as ♥♥♥♥), I was expecting the same here, and when the main character first appeared, I thought this game would be a bad copy of Neptunia. At first, Fang is basically an idiot and I wasn't liking the character in the first hours.\nBut the game managed to surprise me with one thing: character development. Soon, Fang starts to get more mature and the events around him force him to change. This is another crucial difference from R2: the story is way more serious. There will be blood, deaths and regrets. As the story progresses, even the way Fang talks change, reflecting his own change. There are three endings: the Normal End and two endings, one for each girl. I will not tell who they are. I've only got ''A girl ending'' but the romance felt convincing and I really cared if they would manage to stay together in the end, which is a surprise, giving that most games have bad developed character interactions and romances. Unfortunately, not all characters are developed and I didn't care about some of them in the end. There's one in specific that I think it's very stupid (Pippin), and ironically you can use him as a weapon in R2.\nOh, there is another surprise too: the OST. The songs are awesome. Check them out on youtube.\nBut there are a few bad things, for example. there's just little world customization compared to R2, and less endings too compared to R2. The enemies are repetitive, only changing colors as they grow stronger, and some dungeons are repetitive too. Those are the same problems of R2, but I felt that there's only a few original enemies in Fairy Fencer F compared to R2. I missed some events and characters, but I don't feel like playing it again to complete what I missed, unlike R2 where I beat the game 3 times.\nThat said, with it's great story, character development, combat mechanics and progression and an awesome OST, Fairy Fancer F is worth full price, and it's a game that I will always remember with care. If you like this genre, go ahead and buy it. You will not regret it.","January 15","true","34.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However unlike the HyperDimension series Fairy Fencer F takes on a slightly more serious approach to their story. The game's combat is a bit repetitive and that's the only complaint I have with the game (its combat system is quite similar to that of the HyperDimension series), however what really drew me in to this game are the whacky characters, particularly the lazy main character Fang. There are some good laughs to be had here and if you love the HyperDimension series then I can HIGHLY RECOMMEND this game to you. If you're not a fan of those games however then honestly you may not like this one either, unless it was the characters in HyperDimension that turned you off. Either way, if you're in, then bear those fangs (pun-intended) and JUST DO IT.","December 23, 2015","true","34.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

EXP boosts, Weapon upgrades, Drop increases and the like are all able to be modified a little bit.\n\nThe game has some cheesy lines, some pretty good references if you can spot them, and is overall fun to play. While the replayability is kind of low in my opinion (the 2nd playthrough thing is completely useless) and some of the secrets you won't even have a chance to think about unless you knew it was coming, but the characters are fun, the skits are really funny and of course, the Fan-Service isn't too bad. Multiple endings mean you'll have to play the game at LEAST 3 times before you see everything, but it's still a fun game.\n\nIf there was one thing I really didn't like about the game, it's the amount of time you have a particular party member in your group for. I know there are games where you lose your party members if you're not careful, like in most Fire Emblem games, but this was a little ridiculous.\n\nOther than that, it's a fun game. Plenty of impelling plot-twists (some cliche others not so much) but all in all, a fine game.","January 11","true","47.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

That's a good way to tell if you will like the format of the game. Obviously, there's a completely different set of characters and a separate plot. Overall, I really liked the game, but there are some problems. The lead character, Fang, starts out aggressively annoying and Tiara is only a little better at the beginning as well. Fortunately, the two have character arcs and they do grow and get a lot more engaging. Some of the achievements are way too grindy and if you don't have the DLC dungeons, then it could take days to get 100,000,000 gold. The same is true of many of the challenges, but fortunately, you don't need to complete any of the challenges to have powerful characters.","April 13","true","102.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Good, that's a step in the right direction.\n\nEssentially, a considerably dumbed-down version of Hyperdimension Neptunia\nwith subpar characters and a lackluster story. I'm being brutally honest here though.\n\nFang  is probably one of the most uninteresting main character's i've had the displeasure of playing the game as. Not only is he blatantly broken in pretty much every moment of the game, his goofy attitude that made him even bearable in the first place get's replaced with a layered hardass-attitude that turns him from "Happy-Go-Lucky" into a "Brooding" Protagonist.\n\nLike Neptunia games, this game's combat system is flashy and all about unleashing special attacks that do a lot of damage. However, you honestly get to a point to where you cheese through everything anyways, so it doesn't matter much.\n\nThe story is meh. You play it once, you're done with it forever.\nEssentially you play through the same game twice per run though, because time shenanigans.\n\nIt's not bad, but not great.\nPlay once, put it down.\n\n","April 25","true","27.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Took about 20 hours to beat but wasn't very difficult to do so. Bosses are pretty easy all the way to the end. I only got one ending  out of three apparently but I'm not feeling too motivated to get the other two. I was really playing for the sake of knowing what happened at the end and it wasnt very satisfying i have to say. Pretty cliche anime-type ending but I wasn't expecting much more than that.\n\nCharacters weren't bad but if you are familiar with anime or manga at all they all fit into the typical character types, which is  pretty much a given as soon as you are introduced to the main character. Cliche as they are they are still fun to listen to.\n\nThe sound and music are decent but nothing special at all and you quickly realize there isn't a very large musical score to accompany the game and you'll here the same tunes over and over again.\n\nThe areas are pretty small  and there really isn't any exploring. There is an ability to search for inivisible items but I hardly used it because just didnt seem worth it.\n\nThere is a "game-plus" mode where you play the game again with what appears to be levels and abililties from your previous clear but honestly not sure why you would do that.\n\nGameplay was alright, better than FFXIII but that isn't saying much there.\n\nOverall I wouldn't buy this unless it's on sale. It isn't bad but it won't ever go on my list of favorite games.\n\nI think there is like a sequel but I do not think it's on Steam.","June 4","true","20.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
