"http://steamcommunity.com/id/HARVESTERFTW/recommended/12810/","HARVESTERFTW","Angry Russian Child","http://steamcommunity.com/id/HARVESTERFTW/","120 products in account","This game is quite flawed, walk into it knowing that.\n\nThe first thing I did (as I do with most games) is open whatever configuration options the game makes available, and unfortunately for us, the graphics options leave much to be desired. The configuration screen seems more to set your resolution and generic quality dropboxes than tweak the game to work on your system. Thankfully, most PCs should be able to run this fine (I run it at a native 1366x768 at High on a laptop released two or so years ago) and it looks quite nice.\n\nThis is also a game you must play with attention paid to the story. The game has excellent writing and a sense of humour that gets me every time. Heck, the tutorial teaches you how to play by telling you to ruin this world's version of Christmas, and then the main game encourages you to go seal clubbing. The great writing often carries the game through rougher bits, like the odd graphical glitches that can cause a minion's eyes to momentarily dislodge from its body or the wonky minion AI that compels my Reds to walk up and punch the vicious hunter. But playing as many glitchy, underpolished games as I have rather immunizes me to these kinds of things so I can look past them and still find the plethora of fun.\n\nMany improvements have been made over the first. For instance, the player is now a dangerous force in combat, spells are much more useful, and minions are less inclined to drown themselves. Minor nigglings like the amount of effort needed to craft weapons have been addressed, and minions have much more personality now. In fact, you can even choose to have certain favourites come back from death, and you ca track the title and level of each throughout the course of the game. It makes equipping certain minions less of gamble because you don't lose the fancy gladius when Beezer the Seal Slayer gets mauled out in the field.\n\nOverall, Overlord II is a game you need to adjust your expectations for. It's not the most complicated game (puzzles are often just assigning certain minions to a task) and the combat often devolves to chucking brown minions at anything that so much as breathes but it's the heart the game wears on its sleeve that makes it a worthwhile purchase. And at an impulse-friendly $10, it's not really that big of a ounch to the pocketbook if you walk away feeling unfulfilled with the game's antics.","December 1, 2013","true","3.1"," 140 of 152 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","140","152","0","0"

Here you command war machines and ships. The areas are more detailed and offer more adventure. Also, your minnions can gain "mounts" to ride into battle. Brown, Green, and Red each get a unique mount. The is plenty of enjoyable fun. Some areas are better than others but I'm sure that will be a personal feeling for each player. I enjoyed the greatly expanded world. New play mechanics like "minnion possession" are really fun. The Overlord series is about enjoying yourself and ravaging the world with your minnion hordes. The ability to choose and combine 4 different types of minnions means every battle can be replayed countless times. I really liked these light-hearted Overlord games that always provide new challenges and keep player enjoyment foremost during the entire game. Replay for Overlord 2 is very high and honestly fun. This series is a big sleeper that many people missed but thanks to Steam you can enjoy the experience.\n\nI rate Overlord 2 and 8 out of 10.","April 22, 2014","true","61.0"," 96 of 98 people (98%) found this review helpful","98","96","98","0","3"

I actually prefer how the original game handled some of the aspects such as armor/weapon upgrades. The upgrade options make more sense, but I felt you had to grind for money way to often and just ended up almost skipping it entirely.\n\nThe addition of mounts for your minions was actually amazing and probably the main thing that sets this game above the original. My main complaint with the game is honestly it just doesn't feel like it is as fleshed out as it could have been when it comes to things like controling the towns. I loved putting down a revolt, but since it only happens once per town it isn't even really a spoiler. The mistresses are handled the way they should be.\n\nThe magic felt weak for some reason to me. The spells help and all, but I never really felt like an all poweful cast sacrifcing minions for personal gain. I enjoyed the idea of minion level up system and bringing back high levels from the dead, but to be honest I never used it.\n\nThe game still has the same minion types as the original which is very balanced still. The tactics of killing commanders and using catepults was very enjoyable. The ability to mind control a minion and lead an assault or stealth mission was great. The games dark humor is always enjoyable. It still seems to have choices which are essentially evil vs chaos evil.\n\nThe main thing that I wish it had more of was funny bosses like Melvin Underbelly from the original. I did als find it strange that blues never got a mount when I kept thinking they would get a frog or a slug mount. Overall the humor and variety of gameplay make it a neat nitch market title.","October 20, 2014","true","19.0"," 56 of 61 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","56","61","0","0"

As you explore and get new minions and powers you can unlock things you previously couldn't access. Also if you decide you have a favorite minion, with enough life force you can bring them back.\n\nThe game has an alignment system split between domination and destruction, so if you go around killing everyone and everything you meet you get destruction points and your armor changes and you become more destructive in combat. If you enslave everyone you meet, you get domination powers and your armor changes and you get better at enslaving and dominating things. You can also choose to walk the middle path and keep your default overlord armor and abilities, it's not a bad thing if you do.","April 26, 2015","true","21.1"," 31 of 33 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","31","33","0","0"

The good stuff is still here, and the bad stuff is mostly still here.\n\nThe good stuff:\n\n- Funny and fun game! The cheerful villainy of Overlord 1 is still here, with plenty of cheeky British humour and a parody of Tolkien tropes.\n\n- Controlling your minions is as fun as ever. They are a lively bunch, scooping over their targets in a frenzy, picking up helmets and swords and what not for their own use. Their delight in evil is hilarious and strangely endearing.\n\n- The four types of minions have different abilities, strengths and weaknesses. Acquiring each type is a quest in itself, and then you get to utilise them in various combat puzzles during the rest of the game.\n\n- If it's your thing (it's not my thing) you can customise your evil base, invest in different buffs and level up your gear and your minions. There's a whole metagame in there.\n\n- The story never takes itself too seriously, and the whole thing has a light, fun feel to it.\n\n- It's an open world, and you can switch between quests at your leisure, there's no linearity.\n\n- I'm glad there's now a minimap - Overlord 1 didn't have one and it was pain to navigate sometimes. Much better here.\n\nThe bad stuff:\n\n- The minions might be fast and nimble, but your player character (the Overlord) is as slow and lumbering as he was in OL1. I get that it's supposed to be this way - you're the heavy tank and they're the quick little rogues - but your slowness is really tedious when much of your play time is spent slowly tromping from point to point. Yes there are portals, but not often enough.\n\n- Controls can be rather fiddly. You're trying to manage 4 different minion groups, setting waypoints, moving them around, while also moving yourself and fighting with your own weapons and spells.\n\n- I haven't finished the game. At least not as of this review. Maybe because I played OL1 and started this right away, but I got rather bored at some point. And the slow movement pace really doesn't help.\n\n----------------\n\nOverall, this gets a big recommendation from me. I suggest you start with playing Overlord 1: Raising Hell, then take a break, then start with Overlord 2.","December 12, 2015","true","17.7"," 18 of 18 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","18","18","0","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kalathi/recommended/12810/","kalathi","The Fresh Prince of All Saiyans","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kalathi/","80 products in account","Overlord's a pretty unique game. You play as an evil Overlord who commands a small army of goblin-like minions to do his dirty work for him. At the outset, you'll be able to keep 15 under your control at a time, and that number will rise as you move forward in the story. There's something viscerally satisfying watching your minions wreak havoc on an enemy town - the little guys gleefully destroying everything in sight while the occupants run around in terror, many of them with a minion or two clinging to their backs and clubbing them to death. Mayhem and chaos ensues and it's entertaining to watch, and you can wade into the fray and knock things around with a huge axe if you don't feel like sitting on the sidelines.\n\nIf it sounds too dark, don't worry - the game has a great morbid sense of humor and doesn't try to play it straight, so it's never depressing or disturbing. The game pokes fun at fantasy conventions too - early on you make enemies of the elves, who are literal tree-hugging hippies who are pretty upset that you've been clubbing baby seals to death to harvest life force for your growing army. The primary villians are a Roman-style Empire, who are rounding up and killing magic beings (like you and your minions), and the story takes jabs at ancient Rome sterotypes. Your senior minion advisor also narrates things for you, and the detest he expresses for the more beautiful side of fantasy settings is pretty hilarious.\n\nThe game plays well, but there are problems with the controls. Later on, combat demands precise control over your minions, and the game doesn't really do that well enough. It leads to some frustrating moments where you're fumbling around trying to give the right orders to your minions, while your enemies are picking them off - giving you a taste of the confusion you normally cause. Some of the genre's typical sins come here too - there's a couple of clunky vehicle sequences, and at least one forced stealth section. To the game's credit, these segments aren't nearly as infuriating as you'd expect, but they still felt unnecessary and weren't very fun.\n\nOverall it's a fun game, and I recommend it despite its shortcomings - especially to players who enjoy "summoner" type characters in other action RPGs (such as Diablo), or those who are looking for something different in the genre.","January 11","true","22.0"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","1"

There is always the option of being a nice(r) guy but the primary goal is to be the nastiest SOB the land's ever seen. Story progression is quick, but it will, in turn, slow down considerably which can bore some. You're crossing stuff off a to-do list the whole time. Regardless of these shortcomings, I still consider myself part of the cult following the series has.\n\nSome nitpicking as referenced by the cons index:\n(1) Your minions are stupid, demented, unhinged, and unfathomably cute, but this is no excuse for their shortcomings. Targeting an object/enemy on a ledge is not worth attempting since your minion will probably run to the ledge, stare a bit, and run back even if there is an obvious path leading up to the target. You must either sweep by stick/mouse or confirm they can run straight forward to what you are aiming at. Even the gimped Wii side game developed by Climax has pre-mapped courses; one instance is if there is water blocking a path, your minions will fall back and, in record time, follow a detour and make it to where they're going. None of that here, or the first title. The same bug with spawning minions from a pit and having them clip walls is a nuisance even though they warp back to the Netherworld after about a half a minute of realizing they're stuck.\n(2) Overlord originally encouraged you to be a wicked harbinger of destruction with its story-altering irreversible controversial decisions. This time around, you step down to lesser power often throughout the game (some might argue said instances only demonstrate the incredible strength at your disposal) but most of the time, you're just a threat to an always-present higher power and only fundamentally equally-as-powerful as those who occupy your Netherworld "home".\n\nSo, with that mouthful out of the way, I very much recommend this game even with its problems. It has all that made the first game good but it also brought along the same exact problems that plagued the first one, and then some. You should enjoy the game but you cannot reject the presence of the flaky stuff.\n\nIf all this looks good to you, buy this.\nIf you are new to Overlord and seek a spin of the unusually original gameplay the main series has to offer, demo or play the superior first game.\nIf you play primarily for the humor and minions, you will be more than pleased. Buy this.\nIf you play for the story and gameplay, watch some videos and play the demo before making the plunge and tread lightly. (Let's be honest, controls and gameplay were never a strong suit of the series with your minions clobbering everything for you.)\nIf you enjoyed the original as much as I did (VERY thoroughly), buy this.\nIf you thought the first game was alright and you expect real improvements this time around, steer clear and perhaps take a look at Dark Legend for the Wii for a more traditional experience.","May 9","true","42.0"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

Basically in Overlord you are a lord of the underworld (well sort of) u get ur own castle which u have to build up , building things such as your own armour,swords and even things such as the flags, throne etc of ur castle. You will gradually see as time passes how much your castle has grown or you could live it in a pos shape its your choice. This game has a light and dark meter similar to mass effect renegade and paragon system which is really fun due to how your choices can effect the game. You will also get minions which are your army (goblins) that follow you into the world and you can order them what to do, station them where you like and even guard stuff or take things. This goblins has a decent amount of depth to them too because you get to see who has been with you the longest , their level, their names etc etc. This is brilliant compared to overlord 1 so in my opinion its a good addition.

No manual saves to be had, and dying leads to doing a lot of (sometimes very frustrating) things over again.  It's like Fable... only you're evil whether you like it or not.  -and the only interaction you have with citizens is murdering them or brainwashing them.  -and you have an army of evil minions that do your bidding.  You know what, it's nothing like Fable.  You do collect currency and charms to level your character's attributes, upgrade armor & weapons, etc., so it has some RPG elements.

Finally the real overlord game has come out!\n-Its got more to its campaign! Shame the devs cant just repair overlord but waste more money and time to make a 2nd!\n-Forging System a downer! Shame you cant forge like the old overlord and a bit like the 2nd overlord, a good mix. devs cant see that then they must be terrible at making game systems of forging (in that sence)\n-Minions can ride things! depending on their colour depends on the mount! (brown/wolf, green/spider, red/salamander)\n-A better tower! Finally some decorative places, the original was lame. why not just have corridors to rooms and thats it it wont even change my boredome levels!\n-A better Overlord! finally a overlord who knows how magic works.\n-More Mistresses! 3 more! one good, other greedy, other can be evil, or a ghost good!\n-4 Love Scenes! the overlord has 3 mistresses to choose!\n-Possess a minion! with a minion gate possess a minion!\n-A proper waypoint system! heal on a waypoint gate! finally a good fixed V2 of overlord!\n-More INTERESTING! Now we can listen to interesting talk than boring gnarl spams while roaming the tower!\n-Prevented money camping! (most of it) Now players cant cheat on money harvesting that often like the angelis keep gold harvest!\n-Actually FEEL like a true Overlord: All the whelps from the 1st just fear you, YOU NEVER RULE OVER THEM! YOUR JUST A JUDGE WITHOUT THE PRESIDENT'S BADGE!\n\nOverall, a good Version 2 of the 1st Overlord, good job Devs. CANT REPAIR A SIMPLE GAME!?","February 27, 2015","true","73.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

You will spend the entire game finding your minions and then rushed into a drawnout final fight. I was really hopeing for an extension of the first game but not even the story felt right. ya i know it follows the 'evil' line of the first and all that but the entire story just dident feel right. Stacked on top of a rerun of 'these are minions and you must spend the whole game geting the hives' the new elements of reviving minions and addition of mounts is quickly forgotten. The castle and mistresses also missed the mark drasticly. You dont really get to upgrade your home aside from a small selection offere by 3 mistresses. No arena, single pass levels and resource restricted forgeing basically strangles all the fun stuff of the first game clean out of this one.\n\nThe next overlord to be released is not even gonna be a overlord game but a spinoff coop thing that dident really get me excited so unfortunately this may be the most uptodate overlord you can expierence and i cant bring myself to recomend it.

A good puzzle is where you have all the pieces you need to start and get an "ah ha!" moment when you put them together. In this game puzzle pieces are such that when you find how they fit together, it's more of a "really? that's the solution?" A lot of the difficulty is telling apart the parts of the terrain you're supposed to interact with from the parts that are just fluff. "Oh, so that one vine I can send minions up, despite every version of that vine up to this point just being a decorative piece."\n\nAlso, minions get stuck A LOT, and when a minion gets stuck then you're down a minion for the rest of the level. This means that by the time you get to the end, half your minions are stuck on terrain and you have to try to beat the boss with just a few minions. Note: If minions die, you can easily replace them. If they get STUCK, you're screwed.","February 27, 2015","false","1.8"," 15 of 31 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","15","31","0","0"

This isn’t an awful game, but it's not one that I would recommend to others.\n\nTo me the controls seem a bit odd, certain actions like sweeping with the minions are strange.  Other controls like madly clicking the left mouse button over and over will leave you with a permanently damaged digit.  The premise of the game is a let down too.  The summary states that you finally get to play as the bad guy, I was hoping for something far less cartoony and silly.\n\nMost of the game is trying to figure out how to get certain types of minions to complete a certain puzzle so that you can progress in the weak story.\n\nI’ll have to check out the original Overlord and see if it’s any better.\n\nPros\nThis is a very unique game.  I don’t think you will find anything like it.Cons\nGraphics are a little ugly, the game doesn’t look great.\nThe game just feels like a variety of pointless puzzles that you have to overcome in order to cause some comical mischief with your minions.\n","December 4, 2015","false","1.5"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","1"

Ok so let me talk about the game you play as a little kid in the introduction that is very demented and than gose on to try to rule all the land> Now this game dosent have the best quality of graphics but it dose look very good and in. Some parts of the game even beutiful. This game has some jokes in it that might make you laugh and you get "Dark mistress's". Now you get three dark misstress's in the game i belive and each mistress has a different personallity to the others one is like a country nordic type. Another is a empie woman that ephisizes beuty. Another is a fariy queen you bend to your will though your dark magic and and then wants to rule with you. So thats all of the wives you can have or "Dark mistress's" as they are called in the game now the gameplay is standerd and really easaly understood and you get. 4 types of minnions Brown your standard all round minnions. Reds more ranged minnions that use fire. Your greens witch are your steath minnions that deal lage amounts of damage by back stabing or. just laching onto enemys and whaling at them. And then you finally have your blues wich are your healer minnions that resersct dead minnions and they can swin the only minnions that can. Now you use these minnions differently epending on the area you are in or the thinga you have to face they are very. For the most part not that smart and most likely meant to be a lovable part of the game other than the mute protaganist. Now to the point this game is very enjoyable and i would give it a 7/10 it is very fun and dose have some parts to leave you frustated but it is overall an enjoyable game.","March 9, 2015","true","15.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Still not as good as it should be.\n\nIf you played the first game and actually liked it, you'll love this game. Everything is better fleshed out here. Upgrades to the tower serve more of a purpose. Art is better. You can actually sit on the throne in this game. You don't get handmaidens this time but you get more mistresses. You get a minimap in this game, finally.\n\nYou feel like more of an overlord in this game. Rather than being split into evil and eviler (which was really good and evil when you added it all up) This game splits between domination and destruction. Either you're here to conquer or to watch the world burn. You can dominate villagers and actually put them to work for you producing goods. There will be tribute waiting for you with each visit. The game is also focused more on actual inflitration and battle and less on arbitrary puzzles.\n\nBut its not perfect. The humor is as bad as it was in the first game. Very cheesy, very obvious and not in an over the top good way. You also aren't going to feel like this is your character but that was a problem in the first game. And the adviser is still calling the shots. You have to do basically what he says.\n\nIf you can catch this on sale and you're looking for some hack and slash with minor tactical elements, this game is fun enough to justify itself.","September 22, 2014","true","69.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

They can do more things like ride mounts. Your spells are also a lot more fun to use once you collect them. They make an impact, but aren't easy-mode mob obliderating (I'm looking ar your Inferno spell). Everything is just BETTER then the last one, and is improved upon in almost everyway.\n\nThe MOUSE CONTROLS on the other hand are rage-enducingly buggier then they used to be and will more often then not accidently get half your minions killed. Like HOLY ♥♥♥♥ have I had some times where the game just decides to flip out and send a dozen minions into a boss monster and just die. ♥♥♥♥ing FANTASTIC.\n\nI really liked Overlord 1 and Overlord 2 is nice too, but the RAGE the control bugs will cause amongst other game-breaking bugs you might run into make this a 7/10 for me though.\n\nIf you liked Pikmin, you'll probably like Overlord.","November 17, 2011","true","24.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","1"

If you enjoyed Overlord and were hoping that this might add something a little different to the franchise then don't bother. There are a few new things. It is pretty cool that the minions can ride mounts and the times when you posess one of your minions are a nice touch, but in general it just feels like a retread of the original, still with all the annoying controls that involve you having to hold down multiple keys and buttons at the same time to control your minions.

If you're tired of the whole "third person action" genre, which has now become a chiche, in my opinion, this is the game for you. You needn't have played the first game to understand this one as the stories are self-contained and the game does an excellent job at teching you the ropes.\n\nI only have 2 problems:\n\n1. The crafting system in the original game was replaced in this one. In the original, forging and upgrading weapons/armour allowed you to sacrifice minions to give the weapons/armour specific properties, according to the amount of each of the four minion types that was sacrificed when forging/upgrading. Here, that system is replaced with a selection of pre-made weapons/armour. Lame.\n\n2. It isn't a knock on the game itself, but Steam doesn't seem to have the Battle Rock Arena DLC avaliable for Overlord 2. It's a shame, as this DLC effectivly added the dungeon from the first game into this one, as it is strangly missing. Wish they would add it but probably won't.\n\nAt the time of writing, Steam says that I've spent 18.5 hours on this game. Let is be known that I got this game 2 days ago and I also sunk about 2 dozen hours into the PS3 version. 9.5/10 would Overlord again.","December 30, 2014","true","20.2"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

After all that work to conquer and acquire in Overlord 1, we find that this edition is the same story. The last overlord defeated (how?), you must rise up and rebuild his empire. Oh look, the hives are lost again, and the entire game will consist of finding them in a series of convoluted puzzles. Even moreso than in Overlord 1, as soon as you've really acquired the power of the overlord, it's time to end the game, and thus lose it.\n\nNew enemy moves everywhere, yay! I like that part. I REALLY like the formation and panic mechanics. There were definitely better mechanics to deal with combat wise, if only they weren't built around puzzles.\n\nI have to say though that most of the new moves and features contribute to the endless one-off mini-games. Puzzles puzzles everywhere. what happened to just marching through blowing everything up and overwhelming it with my minions? Pity that nearly every battle is now a minion-movement puzzle. And I mean EVERY battle. No more overwhelming your enemies quickly or charging in yourself.\n\nForging is now pre-set recipes, and my preferred recipes are nowhere to be found. I guess winning isn't on the menu. Playing with the best recipes I could find I still felt profoundly inferior to my character from overlord 1.\n\nAdd in the nany engine prevening me from auto targeting the intentionally irritating townsfolk, the cliched way the bad guys ALWAYS get the drop on me (I detest cutscene combat), and the fact that I cannot even farm up life-force for the war of attrition anymore (yes, farming spots exist, WAY out where they are hard to get to, they normally only occur as the plot progresses).\n\nMy final opinion? Some wanna be genius in marketing or senior management decided to re-target this at a younger,  stupider audience, while forgetting that it is a game concept that attracts older, more intelligent customers. It could have been done SO much better.","June 10, 2015","false","24.2"," 2 of 10 people (20%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","20","2","10","2","0"

It's not as bad as the first one, but sure is close. The controls are still terrible, locking on rarely works right, the minion AI is somehow worse than it was in the first one. The spells are stupid and even more confusing to use. The weapon upgrade system is worse and more confusing. The story or lack there of is the exact same thing as the first one, which I wouldn't so much care about if both games weren't complete crap. Some of the quests are so stupid and boring, that you will likely just choose to skip them.\nThe enemies are annoying too and take too long to kill, because they block everything. The fact that the combat is so boring makes this so much worse. It is an extreme struggle to play though, especially since its bad for all the wrong reasons.\n\nUpdate:\nI just sort of beat the game and it is worse than the first game. It is a horrible game from start to finish. I didn't even bother trying the last boss a second time after I died, because the fight is completely stupid, extremely long and even more boring. You basically just have to hope your minions do what you want (which is rare) and you have to pretty much depend on your reds, which can't hit a moving target so you're screwed.

The characters are amusing and the dialogue hits a good balance of "you're a badass" and "dont' take yourself so seriously" that I like in games.

"Oh I had to hold the mouse while sweeping and using this minion to get them to go there and do this thing" is a recurring issue. The puzzles often involve too much back tracking and repeating yourself to be anything but tedious and so far none have been a real challenge.\n\nThe ideas are fun, the execution unfortunately is lacking to the point of getting in the way of enjoying the game for me. I'll probably finish it someday but it's one of those that I dread playing because I know it's only a matter of time before I say "oh come on" when I realize I have spend ten minutes running around looking for the one thing I need to click in some odd way and it makes the level take twice as long as it should to complete.","June 24, 2014","false","7.0"," 12 of 33 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","12","33","0","0"

There is a multiplayer option as well as split screen so it looks like coop but the servers are nonexistant.\n\nThe game isn't that bad, but some aspects of it are an annoyance, such as the pathfinding on minions while enslaved civilians are following you or picking up equipment when they need to get out of the way, farming treasure, life force, and crystals to get that armor you wanted so badly in the forge.\n\nThere's 4 minions based on colors and 3 mounts for 3 of the minions, each with their own abilities, appearance and combat style. They're all pretty much demons.\nBrowns: They look like goblins, they specialize in melee and are the first you should send, their mounts are wolves who can jump across gaps and while using the "sweep" command gain a boost that can break defensive stances on empire units.\nReds: They are imps that specialize in fire ranged attacks as well as putting out fires in a weird way but hey it works, keep them away from melee conflicts or they will die, their mounts are salamanders and while using the "sweep" command, the reds can run and gun as well as access ramps. There isn't much action for the salamanders though. Just about one level which is disappointing.\nGreens: Also look like goblins, are melee assassins that specialize in attacking enemies from behind, keep them out of head on attacks by sending them after the browns. Their mounts are spiders they don't add much to combat but they add to mobility by allowing them to go on walls with webs while "sweeping."\nBlues: Aquatic demons that have a high impact on puzzles in the late game who focus on revival and 0 combat effectiveness. Holding the "sweep" command will give them a "blink" status where they can run through enemies unseen so long as they keep moving as well as temporarily destroying pools of excess magic. No mounts\n\nThe story along with it's humor is pretty good and the choices between death and destruction or enslavement is decent but there's not really much of an impact on those choices besides affecting your "Alignment." The alignment system I haven't been able to test at all because of how slow it shifts based on killing or enslaving civilians or quest objectives.\n\nThe greatest disappointments for me were the credits and ending cinematic, major boss fights, the soundtrack which was okay, cinematics being synced to your world (an example of this would be some fleeing archers in freeze frame while x talks about y), and the side quests of controlling a town.\n\nI don't know if the disappointments were caused by a budget or anything else. But many things in this game could have been better for its time. Overall a nice buy on sale.\n\n3/5\n\nAlso don't be a ♥♥♥♥ing baby when your game doesnt want to start. Go to the ♥♥♥♥ing forums and look up the problem like a smart human bean.","January 13, 2015","true","19.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game requires you to be able to handle being very evil, they have removed the moral choices between good and bad, and have replaced them with domination and destrucion choices, where you either enslave people (new power) in towns or quests (controllable towns have been added), while the destruction choice is just killing them. if you want to see what level of evil you have to handle, play the demo. The atmosphere is great, you go from glaciers, to tropical forests, to roman sytle cities, to disease ridden wastlelands (which is the map from overlord 1). I think it is a very good game.

In this game, you empower the evil overlord in charge of hordes of minions and proceed to wreak havoc and destruction on elves, gnomes, baby seals, and a pseudo-roman empire.\n\nPros:\n\n• Unique gameplay. Another reviewer summed it up perfectly: it plays a bit like Pikmin turned evil. You control a series of expendable minions, which you use to kill, loot, and pillage for you. There are many types of minions, and so a wide variety of strategies are available when deciding how to assault an enemy horde. Furthermore, you yourself can enter the battle wieilding a giant sword in one hand and magic in the other, and so you can choose exactly how to approach enemies. From afar with fire-throwing minions? Up close in a head on attack? Spider-mounted spiders for a sneak attack?\n\n• Great funny story and really good voice acting. Furthermore, the emphasis on the need to do evil is, quite frankly, hilarious.\n\n\nCons:\n\n• Camera movement is crude, and can be annoying at times.\n\n• Minions seem to lose themselves and/or get killed accidentally surprisingly often. Having said this, it is true that minions are meant to be stupid, so maybe this was done on purpose.\n\n\nOverall\nGreat game if youre looking for a game to laugh with, if you want a game with a gameplay that differs from the generic mainstream shooters or RPGs in todays market, or if you want to unleash the inner evil overlord inside of you. The only thing its missing is more maps, minions, and perhaps a workshop format with the ability for people to play community-made maps.","June 13, 2015","true","32.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Now don't be fooled by the amount of hours I have played this game on my account on steam, I have played this game on both steam, xbox 360 and pc physical box cd, and each time I bought it, it was worth it!  There are a few bugs and issues and complaints I have for this game, but nothing that overall takes away from the game's experience.  Now I guess I should mention that my love for this game may be a bit biased towards this game, because during my 16th year this game saved me from a manic depression state, but I've looked at this game in a cynical viewpoint and I can still say that it is worth buying and worth all the support you can give it.\n\nPros & Cons:  Now comes the part where I talk about the issues I had with the game from my cynical viewpoint.  To be fair, this game does have a very linear path before you, but you can make choices that change the outcome of the game; unlike the first game, you cannot choose to be good or evil, you can only be evil this time round.  There are a few bugs that ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off through-out my seventh playthrough; for example, in my seventh playthrough, I have gotten 100% EVERYTHING, I got all upgrades and I made all the destruction choices... but despite my choices... I still got the neutral ending.  I'm not the only person who has suffered this bug, appearantly every other fan of this game has suffered this bug as well, not one person was able to access the destruction ending, or the Dominance ending, that needs to be fixed for their next game!!  Now the game has some very funny banter and witty social commentary with what's wrong in the world today (spoilers!)  At one point you have to cause global warming by melting the polar ice caps for example.  The combat system and animations in this game, are better than in the last game and look a lot more badass.  There is a hidden love plot between the Overlord and the Irish Mistress kelda, but unfortunately the developers did nothing with it; disapointing, because I wanted to see those two get married at the end if you choose her as your main mistress.\n\nAlright, so that's it with the game.  Please understand that this game is still worth the money, and is one of my all time Favorites; if you love fantasy, if you love both crude and witty humor with a little bit of social commentary with a small love story told in the middle of a dark age, you will love this game.  I promise you, you will love this game.\n\n(Now a personal message to the developers of this Franchise, Triumph Studios.)\n\nOverlady 3 please!! I'll help develope the game with concept art if you want!!! I have a college degree in doing so! my art is some of the best around, I don't care if you pick me to help develope the game, Just please make it!!!  I have bought overlord 1 and 2 both on xbox and pc, I even have bought overlord 2 in both physical case and cd, along with a steam online library version.  Make it an open world like in Fable 2 like the other fan has commented.  You guys made enough money on Age of Wonders 3, make another Overlord, Call it Overlady! make the playable character more mobile and agile, give the playable character more combat actions, and more minion stragedies.   Like minions could form a tower for the overlady walk up like a stairway for instance.   Give it a "Hobbit" movie setting just like in the first one, only expand on it.  You could have witch hunters who hunt down magic being the last reminants of the Empire.  You could have a council of Five magical leaders now, one like Aslan, one like King Arthur and so on.  You could even give a yellow brick road in one of the regions! Hell give it a full fairy tale setting if you like with all the fairy tale characters we all love.  Give the game some stealth mechanics, or some hunting mechanics like in Witcher 3 when you hunt down a witch hunter or magical creature by tracking their red glowing blood.  You don't have to introduce rpg elements, you can keep the old upgrading elements like the ones from the old games.  If you progress through the storyline, you're also rebuilding the old destroyed tower, or you could have your first boss fight against the snow queen and take her tower for your own; Hell you could have multiple towers in the open region world and choose which one you want to temporarily stay in, and in each tower you could assign the mistresses you want.  Each tower could give you a bonus to your attack and/or defense.  You could even introduce a Base defense system, in one point of the game you could have a large group of heroes barging into your tower, and try to chop you down to size, and you could repell the invaders with either traps, or your own fighting force of minions.  You could have a secondary story of the Overlady trying to find her mother: Velvet.  Come on guys, there is sooooo Much potential and love you have for the next game in this franchise, we've been oh so patient, and we've never once stopped loving you Triumph studios for your hard work.    Until we hear from you guys again, we remain your loyal fans.","January 8, 2015","true","1.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If I can somehow fix this graphical issue I have with the game, then maybe i'll upvote it. For some odd reason, whenever someone sends me a message, I take a screenshot, or I open the steam overlay, the game just plain breaks. All I can see is a big box that lets me see through the floor, but makes entities absolutely invisible. Whenever the issue occurs, it makes the game EXTREMELY unplayable and dissapointing, because even though I bought this when it was on sale, I could've spent my money on F.E.A.R. 2, which has less graphical issues and is slightly more outdated than Overlord II.

The first Overlord has gone missing so part two has a brand new overlord that looks the same as tthe first one.  There's a lot more to do in this game and cool options such as using a boat to get around certain places. The minion AI is sooo much better in this game than the first one, which was frustrating at times.\n\nMAJOR CON: GRINDYYYYYYY!!  Overlord II took a different approach than the first one with really making you grind it out for gold and minion spirits.  This will take some time if you are trying to upgrade or get  equipment.  There's no reason for a casual game like this to be that grindy.\n\nI also felt this game was less tactical than the first one. Overlord II is definitely easier than the first one by far.

Yes it is essentially a puzzle game.  You have to figure out how to get from A to B and do C with minimal casualties.\nYou play as the dark Overlord battling a powerful ruler who's bent on ridding the world of magic.\n\nThe good:\n1. Think carefully how to achieve your objectives.  Throwing in your minions without thought is a good way to get them killed.\n2. Game is just the right length.\n\nThe bad:\n3. Some rather tedious bits.\n4. More autosave spots are needed in certain areas.\n5. The minions like to run off far away from where I directed them.\n6. I would have like a better stats system.  What is the difference between two minions in terms of attack and defense?  What about the armor and weapons you craft?\n\nThe ugly:\n7. My game crashed every time I switched to desktop.

It tries to improve on the first, but fails miserably, revealing itself to be in fact an unfinished game driven by an uninteresting story.\n\nWhile the story tries to be interesting, it is pretty bad executed. The premise is that you should have control of what you do, but it ends up just being a "go there, do that" game.\n\nThe minions play a less important role in the gameplay now, they feel a lot more like puzzle tools than your combat army, because they deal 1/10 of your damage, if you just want to kill something, you should not use the minions, it is easier to kill it yourself.\n\nThe game is filled with glitches, such as minions and enemies getting stuck, objectives not triggering. I finished the main story but I could not complete several side quests due to bugs. I also had a hard time progressing, had to reload several times to get past bugs.\n\nWorst of all, the upgrade system. You have several types of upgrades, such as minions, armory and spells. Resources are very limited so you have to be careful with your choices. I completed all levels of minion upgrades and could not notice a difference in damage. The spells you can use are driven by your alignment, since my alignment was good, I did not have any good damage spells, the ones I could use were pretty much useless.\n\nYou should be able change your alignment based on kill or slave decisions, but the game does not clearly tell you when you can slave, so you end up killing and you cannot go back on these choices, since the autosave overrides everything.\n\nStay away from this game. If you have not played the first, do it because it is much better than this one.","January 11, 2015","false","20.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In this game, you empower the evil overlord in charge of hordes of minions and proceed to wreak havoc and destruction on elves, gnomes, baby seals, and a pseudo-roman empire.\n\nPros:\n\n• Unique gameplay. Another reviewer summed it up perfectly: it plays a bit like Pikmin turned evil. You control a series of expendable minions, which you use to kill, loot, and pillage for you. There are many types of minions, and so a wide variety of strategies are available when deciding how to assault an enemy horde. Furthermore, you yourself can enter the battle wieilding a giant sword in one hand and magic in the other, and so you can choose exactly how to approach enemies. From afar with fire-throwing minions? Up close in a head on attack? Spider-mounted spiders for a sneak attack?\n\n• Great funny story and really good voice acting. Furthermore, the emphasis on the need to do evil is, quite frankly, hilarious.\n\n\nCons:\n\n• Camera movement is crude, and can be annoying at times.\n\n• Minions seem to lose themselves and/or get killed accidentally surprisingly often. Having said this, it is true that minions are meant to be stupid, so maybe this was done on purpose.\n\n\nOverall\nGreat game if youre looking for a game to laugh with, if you want a game with a gameplay that differs from the generic mainstream shooters or RPGs in todays market, or if you want to unleash the inner evil overlord inside of you. The only thing its missing is more maps, minions, and perhaps a workshop format with the ability for people to play community-made maps.","June 13, 2015","true","32.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

When I played Overlord 2, I still enjoyed it, but I did feel a little disappointed. Overlord 2 still has the creativeness, fun, and comedy of the original Overlord, but it just doesn't feel the same.\nThere are some things I like about this game. I like the new micromanagement with the minions, and I enjoyed destroying or enslaving towns. Another thing I liked was the improved graphics. Also, there is FINALLY a minimap. The soundtrack is also really good. Also, since you can have 3 mistresses in this game, you have more options on decorating your Tower.The story is really good and very well-written. The tone and humor of the original is still there, and it is very good. Also, the voice actor for Gnarl has reprised his role in this game and i appreciate Codemasters going that extra mile.\nNow for the stuff I don't like about this game. The campaign is really linear and an hour shorter than the original's campaign which ends with 3 dissappointing endings. They also foolishly removed steel, durium, and arcanium. I also encountered a couple game crashes. For example, when I was gnome hunting, when i hit a tree a couple times to get the gnomes on it down so I could kill them, the game crashed. I did this again and it crashed again. So, when you are gnome hunting, don't hit the trees too much, cuz apparrently the game will punish you for it. Also, the magic is really more restricted than it was in the first game because there's only 3 magic types; minions, halo, and domination. Also, the morality system is really disappointing in this game. You see, you have a choice between Domination or Destruction. Domination is where you can mind control the people of the place you conquered to serve you. Destruction is where you can just destroy the place by killing all the people. I see domination and destruction as equal levels of evil. Also, the final boss is really disappointing. To beat the final boss, you have to destroy his weak points located across his body. So, you have to use your green or red minions to destroy them. Disappointing, I know. After a while it gets really boring. Like I said before, you are greeted with three disappointing endings after the final boss.\nOverlord 2 is a good game, but it is not one of my favorites like the original was. I recommend this to die hard Overlord fans and if you're not one, then you should try the original before playing this one.\n\nVerdict:7/10","July 9, 2014","true","42.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The best strategy, like the first Overlord, is to swarm Brown minions on everything - and no matter what area you're exploring or how many mechanics the game layers on-top, the formula doesn't change: Swarm enemies, wait while they attack and/or loot, and deal with tedious and trivial puzzles. Rinse, and repeat.\n\nIf I had to make a recommendation, I'd say play the first Overlord. And while it also suffered from the monotony of a core gameplay loop that overstayed its welcome, I found it enjoyable and humerous enough to see through until the end.\n\nOtherwise, I'd say avoid the Overlord franchise altogether, unless you like spending every other moment thinking "I am, in fact, playing a video game".","December 12, 2015","false","3.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

So let me tell you about Overlord II.\n\nPros:\n+The game has a lovable sense of humor. Sure it may not make you laugh your ♥♥♥ off a lot of the time but it also doesn't make you want to turn the game off. If your sense of humor saves you from that then that's how you know your sense of humor is good.\n+The need to gain power is real! I can't really describe it but whenever I play the game I really feel like... progressing.\n+The game has an interesting soundtrack. Maybe not memorable but interesting to say the least. That's a pro in itself.\n+Your Overlord can rock that gothic look like no other! The armor and weapons you can craft look AWESOME!\n\nCons:\n-The combat's a bit stubby. Sometimes you may struggle to smash something with your mace or axe or whatever. You also may find the target-lock system for magic use is also a bit stubby. It doesn't make the game unplayable but it's also hard to ignore.\n-Minion control can and WILL be annoying sometimes. Again it doesn't make certain areas impossible but it's still hard to ignore.\n-Animations are kinda lame. I mean, Cinematic animations are alright but in-game ones are kinda poorly done. Lip syncing and all.\n-The ending is not only lame but also kind of abrupt. You kill the final boss. Own everything. F*ck b*tches. Get money. The end.\n-There's no big replay value. There's three endings as far as I'm aware but all of which are lame and only show ONE different cutscene each. Spoiler alert. You always win no matter what. The closest thing to a 'bad' ending this game has is the normal one.\n\nMy opinion. It's an alright game. Has plenty of nicks but most of them aren't entirely noticable. I'd give it a 6/10 at least.\n","December 24, 2015","true","42.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Yes it is essentially a puzzle game.  You have to figure out how to get from A to B and do C with minimal casualties.\nYou play as the dark Overlord battling a powerful ruler who's bent on ridding the world of magic.\n\nThe good:\n1. Think carefully how to achieve your objectives.  Throwing in your minions without thought is a good way to get them killed.\n2. Game is just the right length.\n\nThe bad:\n3. Some rather tedious bits.\n4. More autosave spots are needed in certain areas.\n5. The minions like to run off far away from where I directed them.\n6. I would have like a better stats system.

The best strategy, like the first Overlord, is to swarm Brown minions on everything - and no matter what area you're exploring or how many mechanics the game layers on-top, the formula doesn't change: Swarm enemies, wait while they attack and/or loot, and deal with tedious and trivial puzzles. Rinse, and repeat.\n\nIf I had to make a recommendation, I'd say play the first Overlord. And while it also suffered from the monotony of a core gameplay loop that overstayed its welcome, I found it enjoyable and humerous enough to see through until the end.\n\nOtherwise, I'd say avoid the Overlord franchise altogether, unless you like spending every other moment thinking "I am, in fact, playing a video game".","December 12, 2015","false","3.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Evil Found A Way To Be FunGenre: 3rd Person Tactical RPG.\nDeveloped & Published by: Triumph Studios and Codemasters\nPlatform: Windows only.\nBusiness Model: Base Game.\nCopy Purchased by Myself Read the full & unabridged Review on A Paladin Without A Crusade[wp.me]\n\nIn my review of Overlord I, I took issue with the conflicted themes presented by the game. It constant insisted that I was an evil Overlord spreading evil across the land. But it was in stark contrast to the game mechanics and story that I largely felt made the Overlord more of an anti-hero than anything else. Overlord I failed at its objective of treating you like a Lord of Evil in my mind. However, Overlord II didn’t.\n\nOverall Story Thoughts\nYou are the new Overlord. The story starts with you being scouted and tested as a Overlad by Gnarl. Eventually, it leads to you being banished from the mountain village where you grew up, doing lots of damage to the town’s betrayal and going into The Netherworld. After you grow up, your job is to strike out from The Netherworld to the lands above. To set the lands in darkness and/or to conquer the minds of men. To find the one ring, to rule them all and in the darkness bind them.\n\nOriginally posted by KingIsaacLinksr:Uhh...hold on one second, this explanation of the story sounds off. Let me grab the notes I have…rustles through paper...AHA! Here it is. Whoops. It uhh, hehe, isn’t this. My bad, back to the review of Overlord II.\nOk, so there is no one ring and the overall plot is a bit odd. You go from town to town, dominating or destroying everything. Putting down a few rebellions and finding out what happened to The Tower Heart of the past game. All the while the Glorious Empire is constantly trying to stop you and/or take over the world. It then concludes in a rather long and drawn out siege of a castle. Culminating in a fight against a great, monstrous evil. Yeah, unfortunately the game doesn’t quite stick the landing with the ending. I would have rather fought a more “good-guy” bad guy such as some Holy Knight or a Julius Caesar character (to fit the Roman-esque theme they were going for). Someone who was actually trying to defend their people or ideals rather than their own selfish desires. Ok, maybe Julius was a bad example but I think you get the point I’m trying to make. Ultimately, I feel like they missed out on what could have been a really solid ending.\n\nOverlord II's Themes\nThat all said, it’s these little touches and more that I probably forgot to mention that give you the sense of becoming a lord of darkness. While the corny humour is still present, it feels restrained enough to compliment the dark themes at play. In this case, less is more as the times that it tries to be funny actually work, rather than backfire and become tiresome. Overall, it’s a great thematic improvement to the original title.\n\nThe Combat System\nAs a whole, the combat fluctuates from reasonably challenging to borderline-ridiculously-spammy. Some enemies are a little too quirky for my taste and can flatten armies in seconds. Which I can’t really decide if I like or not. But what I do like is the pacing of the combat. Not only does it have a diverse range of enemies and fights but it also has stealth sections. Multiple sections of the game require you to take control of a single minion and lead the army without the Overlord’s body and complete the objective with what minions you have. This stealth aspect really adds a nice change of pace to prevent the RTS-esque fights from getting too samey or overdone. It’s also pretty forgiving as there aren’t any instant failure states. I really enjoyed these sections and they were a welcome addition.\n\nPC Settings & Multiplayer\nVisually, this game is much better than the previous. Lush forests, sunny beaches and cold mountain villages really spice the world up. Most of the settings for Overlord II (Video, Audio & Controls) are changeable in the game’s launcher. There’s options for pretty much every custom visual setting I can think of. Most are on/off switches with Texture Detail, Debris Detail, Shadow Detail, View Distance and Particle Detail having sliders. Separate audio sliders are included (in-game) for sound, music and speech with support for up to 8.1 surround sound. Controller and keyboard + mouse are supported with key remappings for both. Controller is, in my opinion, the most optimal. Overall, the game is well optimized with consistent framerates and good looking visuals. Outside of the one crash I experienced, (towards the end of the game), the game seems relatively stable. I didn’t get a chance to experience the multiplayer because either the servers are down or no one is playing the game.\n\nFinal Thoughts\nOverlord II enhances everything about the first game. It brings a more consistent theme, new minion abilities & spells, lusher environments and a feeling of being a true Overlord. It doesn’t quite stick the landing though. The story’s last chapter is drawn out and the ultimate bad guy you get to fight is disappointing. The combat is better this time with subterfuge, new enemies and different tactics/spells that can be used. But it’s still….janky at times when I don’t think it should be. There’s a good amount of content though, you'll definitely get your fill of each place the game can take you to. The replay value is a bit weak especially with multiplayer not functioning. Ultimately, this Overlord game was actually a fun time despite my problems with the combat system. The combat is improved enough that I can recommend it. With the caveat to expect frustration while dealing with some of the more eccentric bosses and monsters. Still, evil did find a way, to be fun and enjoyable. So, kudos to Triumph for that.\n\nRead the Full Review on A Paladin Without A Crusade[wp.me]\nA Paladin’s Steam Review: Overlord\nA Paladin’s Steam Review: Overlord: Raising Hell","May 2, 2015","true","19.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Those who are completionists or would like some background information about the story (like me); should play the first game up 'till they upgraded their tower and gear and/or get bored of it - because the ending doesn't offer much satisfaction at all.

Still the game is worth much more actual gameplay time than the first which can get you stuck on an area for hours, there's still a tiny hint of that in Overlord 2 but not so much so that it becomes a problem. If you can catch it on a sale (Halloween is usually a good time) Overlord is well worth your time if you enjoy a bit of slapstick, pikmin, and some crude evil humor.","March 4","true","14.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

When I played Overlord 2, I still enjoyed it, but I did feel a little disappointed. Overlord 2 still has the creativeness, fun, and comedy of the original Overlord, but it just doesn't feel the same.\nThere are some things I like about this game. I like the new micromanagement with the minions, and I enjoyed destroying or enslaving towns. Another thing I liked was the improved graphics. Also, there is FINALLY a minimap. The soundtrack is also really good. Also, since you can have 3 mistresses in this game, you have more options on decorating your Tower.The story is really good and very well-written. The tone and humor of the original is still there, and it is very good. Also, the voice actor for Gnarl has reprised his role in this game and i appreciate Codemasters going that extra mile.\nNow for the stuff I don't like about this game. The campaign is really linear and an hour shorter than the original's campaign which ends with 3 dissappointing endings. They also foolishly removed steel, durium, and arcanium. I also encountered a couple game crashes. For example, when I was gnome hunting, when i hit a tree a couple times to get the gnomes on it down so I could kill them, the game crashed. I did this again and it crashed again. So, when you are gnome hunting, don't hit the trees too much, cuz apparrently the game will punish you for it. Also, the magic is really more restricted than it was in the first game because there's only 3 magic types; minions, halo, and domination. Also, the morality system is really disappointing in this game. You see, you have a choice between Domination or Destruction. Domination is where you can mind control the people of the place you conquered to serve you. Destruction is where you can just destroy the place by killing all the people. I see domination and destruction as equal levels of evil. Also, the final boss is really disappointing. To beat the final boss, you have to destroy his weak points located across his body. So, you have to use your green or red minions to destroy them. Disappointing, I know. After a while it gets really boring. Like I said before, you are greeted with three disappointing endings after the final boss.\nOverlord 2 is a good game, but it is not one of my favorites like the original was. I recommend this to die hard Overlord fans and if you're not one, then you should try the original before playing this one.\n\nVerdict:7/10","July 9, 2014","true","42.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It still is a great game. But I wouldn't say it is a fantastic one. As it has many issues that make the game more and more apparent just how flaw it is.\n\nAs it's simple story and humoress antics don't really lead it to be very interesting other than a comedy.

So let me tell you about Overlord II.\n\nPros:\n+The game has a lovable sense of humor. Sure it may not make you laugh your ♥♥♥ off a lot of the time but it also doesn't make you want to turn the game off. If your sense of humor saves you from that then that's how you know your sense of humor is good.\n+The need to gain power is real! I can't really describe it but whenever I play the game I really feel like... progressing.\n+The game has an interesting soundtrack. Maybe not memorable but interesting to say the least. That's a pro in itself.\n+Your Overlord can rock that gothic look like no other! The armor and weapons you can craft look AWESOME!\n\nCons:\n-The combat's a bit stubby. Sometimes you may struggle to smash something with your mace or axe or whatever. You also may find the target-lock system for magic use is also a bit stubby. It doesn't make the game unplayable but it's also hard to ignore.\n-Minion control can and WILL be annoying sometimes. Again it doesn't make certain areas impossible but it's still hard to ignore.\n-Animations are kinda lame. I mean, Cinematic animations are alright but in-game ones are kinda poorly done. Lip syncing and all.\n-The ending is not only lame but also kind of abrupt. You kill the final boss. Own everything. F*ck b*tches. Get money. The end.\n-There's no big replay value. There's three endings as far as I'm aware but all of which are lame and only show ONE different cutscene each. Spoiler alert. You always win no matter what. The closest thing to a 'bad' ending this game has is the normal one.\n\nMy opinion. It's an alright game. Has plenty of nicks but most of them aren't entirely noticable. I'd give it a 6/10 at least.\n","December 24, 2015","true","42.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
