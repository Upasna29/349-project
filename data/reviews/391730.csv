Combing elements of survival, story, and humor to create an amazing title. I will add a TL;DR at the end.\n\nGameplay\nYou are Flux and you are handling a urgent delivery with your robotic companion Juicebox. Your ship is destroyed by quite the purple head thingy... yeah.  You are now stranded on an alien planet and have to try and establish communication again and survive on the planet with its hostile environment.\n\nThe controls within this game are fairly simple using the mouse to either click and you will move there or hold it and you character will move where your mouse is. Crashlands also utilizes the A S D F and C V buttons as quick buttons, the A S D F buttons can be changed to quickly use your items while the C and V buttons are for your wonderfully murderous pet. The game mechanic is done well and I can see how easily it is converted to its mobile counterpart. Crashlands has a large amount of customizable floors and walls with useless furniture to behold. The game does a nice job of guiding you through everything and learning the game with rather comedic moments with Flux and Juicebox whether it be between themselves or the non-hostile inhabitants of the planet. The combat mechanic in the game is very fun as it requires you to be intelligent about you approach with every creature you see, which wants to kill you.... which is almost the entire planet. This game also removes the hassle of having to manage you inventory because apparently you have black hole pockets, just don't question it and be happy. Other than the expected do quest, get gear, and farm stuff mechanics you would expect of an RPG you can also rip the eggs from the creatures you kill and then raise their baby to murder their past brethren, overall very nice as long as you don't think too much on how STWOMPY (My personal Wombit) killed over 100 of his own kind already along with other creatures (so proud). The only problem is having to go back to old areas to remove bits of black so I can see the whole map, as it's quite the long process.\n\nGraphics/Sounds\nThe graphics are cartoonish and more innocent than anything else. They are polished and very smooth and the evolution screen while you evolve your pet is quite majestic to watch. The music is alright and the sounds match the creature well.\n\nPros/Cons\nPros\n\n+ Great survival element\n+ Good amount of customization\n+ Large game allowing you to play for hours on end\n+ Cross-platform saves\n\nCons\n\n- Annoying to have to go back to previous areas of the map to fill it out without black areas\n- Moments where a crafting recipe I was tracking is replaced by a quest item track when I talk for the quest (slightly annoying, perhaps an option to not automatically change the tracked recipe?)\n- Grinding is existent and prevalent within the game\n\nSuggestions\nThese are my personal suggestions that I feel would improve the game.\n\n- With the editor major update (when it is released) there should be an option to create custom player models and creature models to help create a true sense of freedom through customization in the update.\n- If the created creature is hostile the ability to select its attack patten would be amazing\n- Workshop for maps and mods with the large scale update\n- Ability to have "Vanity items" meaning that you could be waring one item for stats, but you can use another item that you prefer visually to be seen on you\n- Ability to see pet stats. To be able to see stats such as growth (Ex 26/100 and when it is evolved #/300), damage, and unique attack chance.\n- Future Co-op feature\n\nFinal thoughts\nI played Don't Starve and it was nice, but it wasn't my cup of tea. Crashlands however dragged me in and keeps me there. The game is fun and even though it is meant more for a mobile platform with its control scheme it does not take away from its value as a game in itself. It's a challenging game and makes you a bit more alert as you try not to get stomped out of existence. I love Flux and her attitude along with Juicebox and I think this game is something I could easily recommend to those who like Don't Starve but want something different and a bit more lighthearted. Also the trailer is just perfect.\n\nTL;DR\nThe game is a more lighthearted version of Don't Starve and is able to keep you in a way Don't Starve couldn't. The game has mobile controls but it really doesn't hurt the game as a whole. There is a large amount of customization and the RPG element is great. This allows for the game to be a large, more open world, RPG survival game. It's actually cool that the main character is a female and the interactions she has between the non-hostile inhabitants of the alien planet, or her robotic companion Juicebox are very humorous at points. There are not many issues I am able to find as I play through the game. The only issues I see people having is that there is a grinding element to the game and that there are times on the map where you have to move to previous areas to have a fully exposed map without any black spots. I would definitely recommend this to people who want a different take on the Don't Starve survival technique or simply want to try something new and love an RPG element with customization.\n\n\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group","January 24","true","21.7"," 133 of 147 people (90%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","90","133","147","6","16"

With their plans to combine all of their games under one universe, I’m happy to support them.  They plan on releasing a world creator/workshop thing AND add even more content if all goes well.  People have issues with the split PC/mobile pricing and extensive (and logical) responses have been made.  Basically, they consider this a $20 game and I’ve enjoyed playing it on both platforms.\n\nEdit: yet?","January 21","true","56.1"," 114 of 122 people (93%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","93","114","122","15","9"

I understand the balancing.\n- Some confusing parts in the story ( ie. where to go, sometimes the outlined areas aren't specific enough )\n- Most mobs are just larger versions of themselves with a new colors, I would love to see more than just coloring differences and maybe some unique attacks\n\nWHAT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE ADDED\n- Mod support / Steam Workshop ( I know it would be hard, but its not impossible. I believe in you game devs. Even if it only could be for local pc saves, it'd be worth it )\n- Co-Op? ( Might be slightly broken, but also not impossible )\n- More mobs\n- More biomes\n- More races\n\nI greatly look forward to the future of this game, and can't wait to see the new mobs, biomes, bosses. I completely support this game and give it a 9.5/10 rating, this game inspires me to make a game. The 15 dollar price tag is reasonable, but if you're put off by that ( Stop being cheap and buy it ) then just get the iOS / Andriod version and try it out, see that its a good game, buy it on steam, and regret just not doing that in the first place.

It oozes a special something, and it just makes me happy.\n\nYou can tell this game was made by people who love games.\nIt respects your time. There's no level grinding. There are generous teleport pads across the open world, and you can teleport to any of them at any time (once you've discovered each one).\nYou have infinite inventory, so you never have to worry about managing what to collect or not-collect. You want to just collect everything.\n\nThe game lets you play however you want, at your own pace.\nThere's no penalty for dying. You WILL die. You will drop some of your items when you die.\nSimply go back to where you died, and you instantly pick them all up again. You move on.\n\nThis game is about enjoying the world that has been created by the team at Butterscotch Shenanigans.\nThe story seems really large, with many side-quests. It's all open world, so you can complete anything at any pace you want, and any order.\n\nThe game just feels good.\nI also recommend picking up the mobile version of the game. Your save will automatically sync between both versions of the game, so you can always play wherever you go. That's another sign of a game developer who truly cares and respects the player!\n\nIf you're looking for a game to get lost in, this is the game to be playing.","January 21","true","33.6"," 70 of 79 people (89%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","89","70","79","3","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/WearyAmoeba/recommended/391730/","WearyAmoeba","WearyAmoeba","http://steamcommunity.com/id/WearyAmoeba/","2106 products in account","Crashlands rocks.\n\nI tested this for around 60 hours before release and can say that the game delivers on it's promise.  The sorta isometric view seems to make everyone mention Don't Starve (damn it.  I just did it.) I see it.  Crafting, weird creatures, item drops, etc...  It's all there.  But the games are very different.  Don't Starve is a grim bizarre survival game that will murder you often as you discover your randomly generated tale.  Crashlands has a scripted story that pulls you through the colorful, randomly generated terrain of three biomes as a super powered interplanetary delivery person. The whole "kill, pick up drops, craft materials, become more badass" loop is super tight. I've spent way too many late nights scouring the savannah for one more essence to give me one more shot at making an epic weapon.  There is some dark compulsive magic at work here.\n\nThe actual combat is interesting because it works well on a tablet or on a PC, and it seems right at home on both devices.  That's cool.  The pc feels comfortable in the whole Torchlight/Diablo format and the approach works well on tablets as well, which I found really surprising.\n\nCrafting is super with the infinite no-fuss-no-muss-none-of-this-stupid-encumberment system.   The Butterscotch Shenanighans crafting slot machine is one of the games best features, and finally getting a great weapon or embiggening a pet is super satisfying.\n\nI love games with pets, and the whole raising, fighting and embiggening of pets is a great addtion.  Pro tip:  If you're as terrible as I am, you can make your pets pretty powerful and let them do most of the work.\n\nThe story is funny and warped and weird and emotional and exciting.  If for some reason you don't like having fun, ignore the story and get back to hitting things really hard.  The game won't penalize you.  If laughing hurts your soul, the gameplay will pull you through.\n\nThis is a really good game.  Just buy it.\n","January 21","true","93.3"," 48 of 52 people (92%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","92","48","52","3","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dragnix/recommended/391730/","Dragnix","{FITH}™Dragnix","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dragnix/","743 products in account","This game was reviewed with a key from the developer\n\nSummary:\nCrashlands starts out of the gate with a good sense of humor, and takes you on an adventure that I enjoyed despite some of my problems with it. The game is very basic in the action RPG genre, and it shows some of its mobile elements (as the game is also available on mobile devices) with some of the control elements and mouse drive controls. With that said, the combat can give a challenge with its sorta give and take gameplay, and it's complemented by a crafting system that has some depth to it. It's a game that took elements that I normally don't enjoy, like “home building” systems, and made them enjoyable for me. It's got a good sense of humor with its small jabs and wit here and there, and the game comes together well as an overall package to deliver a fun experience. I've got 10+ hours in it, but I've seemingly only scratched the surface, as while the game can get repetitive, it definitely delivers on the content in terms of items to collect and craft. Whether it be on Steam or on the mobile platform (if you have something like a Galaxy Tablet, it definitely works well there) (and there's cross platform play), Crashlands is a fun time all around, and is best suited for the kind of adventuring player that wants to take in the sights, and enjoy the trek along the way.\n\nVideo Review: https://youtu.be/VfIkIobolnA\n\nLists:\n+:\nThe game is a sum of it's parts. Every element of the game, even the elements that I find to be negatives, work well together to make the game a sum of its parts. Picture a set of gears working together to power something. That's this game.\nBuilding system is very easy to use and easy to rearrange things with. Very straight to the point, and gets the job done without over complication.\nLike the crafting system, especially with the weapons element. Multiple attempts makes sense for weapons and armors due to rewards of higher calibur weapons. Gives reasons to recraft and recraft.\nBoss encounter and high amounts of enemies in one area definitely bring a strong impact. Surprisingly difficult at times, even at the normal difficulty.\nPets actually make a reasonable difference in battle, especially the bigger ones. They aren't just there for show.\nThere's a lot to do. You can spend a lot of time just exploring to get more items to craft with, and finding new schematics and what not. Those wanting to just get lost in minecraft like elements will enjoy themselves here.\nGame's combat does have a sorta fencing like style to it, and can be challenging in some aspects. Simple, and straight forward, but it works despite its flaws.\nLike the fact that there's cloud saves that works cross platform. Those wanting to do both will enjoy the fact that this seems pretty straight forward.\nSense of humor that knows the power of subtle touch, and not banging you over the head with the joke. It's obvious the developers had fun creating this game from the ground up, and it shows with the execution. Little things like the big baddie showing up out of nowhere to zap the tree I was about to chop down made things a bit more interesting.\nGreat aesthetic. Enemy designs are nice and actually feel a little fresh compared to other games in the genre, and yet still have some familiar aspects to them. Good color choices as well.\nLike the items that were designed to collect items via bombs. Smart.\nPerformance is there. Never dropped under 60 FPS under normal conditions, and even when my machine was doing other significant tasks, it held on to it then too. The machine is up there in terms of specs, but still was surprised.\n-:\nGame suffers in control areas, most likely due to its mobile counterpart. It will take some adjusting, especially in tight gameplay areas where its easy to click on something in the middle of battle.\nWould want to see some better menus and quest tracking. Having some information on the main screen about your next objective would have been appreciated. Some hints on where to get certain materials will go over some players heads.\nWanted more hotkeys honestly. Understand the simplicity and the mobile portion, but 4 hotkeys made switching things in and out for easy a little bit more trouble some that it was worth. Especially with the fact that you can't switch items in battle.\nGame will get repetitive for some, as while there are things to change it up, combat will be against a lot of the same enemies early, and there's fetch quests. Some map legend elements would have helped this.\nThe map implementation can be very annoying, as your natural reaction is to click to drag the map, only to have you teleport to the nearest teleporter.\nThose looking to have their hand held in terms of what to do with quests and items to find will not enjoy elements of this game. Reading quests information and looking at items to determine what you need to is required.\nWould have liked to see the options menu be available from the pause menu, as opposed to only via the title screen.\nOn a side note, it reminds me how badly I am at interior design.","January 21","true","13.9"," 66 of 86 people (77%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","77","66","86","8","4"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/deadjackfr/recommended/391730/","deadjackfr","Deadjack","http://steamcommunity.com/id/deadjackfr/","898 products in account",""Mix Battle Block Theater's humor, gathering in the spirit of Don't Starve and crafting designed by twisted minds.\nAdd to that bits of action rpg with the job of a space courrier expert in fixing alien environments/neighbouring problems... and you have Crashlands !"\n\n\n\nPlot:Your ship was destroyed during an urgent delivery, you play as Flux, a courrier who needs to return home as fast as possible if she wants to keep his job. But first, from noting but with the help of your fellow "Juicebox" you will have to gather, kill, figure out a way to leave the crazy alien planet you where forced to land on.\nAnd kick the ♥♥♥ of the dude who smashed your ship.... this is gonna be a long trip.\n\n\nLayout:Colorfull with a day / night cycle and many biomes, the game knows how to be appealing and varied. Flux, your hero, walks like a dummy and indeed (she admits himself) she has no elbows and knees. Monsters are cute creatures and i have to mention their offsprings to tame, a great addition.\nAll pieces of armor, weaponry are visible on Flux and effects of passiv and actif effects are nice.\nAlso enemies have hundreds of attacks that use various and pretty sprites.\nOnly different version of enemies doesn't change much except in size and subbtle shades of their respective colors.\n\nTo sum up Crashland is a pretty game:  designed like a comic where creatures and characters are enough ridiculous to be loved at first sight. Environments are very nice and the world is huge.\n\n\n\nMusic and Effects:Music is quiet but very good. Slow paced, it makes the adventure much like a walk in an alien park than something.\nI really liked the yoghurt speech of characters and overall effects. Music and effects never bother you. For a game that will catch you during hundred of hours  it's a very good thing.\n\n\nControls:Maybe the most complicate thing to talk about especially because of the cross-platform feature.\nDesigned to be played on a tablet, on pc you only move/interact with your mouse and use few keys as menu/quickslots shortcuts. Simple enough, many tasks are automatic like building walls/floors in your bases, cutting or picking up item where you just need to clic one time. Also items have no durability so coupled with the clever self-managing inventory, it spare you millions of clics.\nBut in combat it's another story. Because of lack of movement keys, especially in the hardest difficulties, you will die alot due to miss clic on ressources or bad timed attacks.\nAlso consider that monsters always have attacks with area of effect so you can imagine how tight it can be. I want to mention the fact that all menus are excellents, crafting is easy and clear, map is perfectly clear too, also you can teleport at anytime to your base and other points of interrest.  Dialogues of quests and even datas about every monster you encounter are stored in a nice compendium.\n\nThe overall is very good and very easy to handle. Only combats can be tricky sometimes.\n\n\nGameplay:Crashlands takes from many games and does a great mix with its own personnality.\n\nYou will farm, kill and grind during hours to get the required gear for every zone you will explore. Especially on Hard and Insane difficulties !\nVery soon you will need to be organized and cultivate restorativ plants, ressources and in general collect/gather everything. This aspect of the game is very important because every pieces of equipement you craft has a random chance to get one of the 5 qualities that varies from basic in white to epic in orange.\nThis difference is also in passiv armor and weapon effects that can trigger amazing bonuses like health leech or even berserker mod where your attacking speed increases.\n\nSo quite often (again in very high difficulties) you will be forced to farm and craft again and again sames items to be able to maximize your stats. Maybe another weak element of the game that should have been turned into a system where you can add more components during crafting and increase chances to get better qualities. You can still recycle your old gear to get some materials.\n\nCombat is of course a huge part in the grinding imposed by the game. I was surprised by how vicious animals can be.\nI started in insane mode and to be honest i got owned so many times with different attack paterns, aggro or even the look of enemies, that i just felt a bit disguted. With very unaccurate controls for movements, many times i had to dodge attacks and instead Flux went to cut a bush/tree/ect....\nSo quickly i had to prepare fields and organize my ressources to aggro correct monsters and time my attacks/movements/ skills accordingly. Especially if you consider that every enemies have attacks with area of effects and marked radius/attack paterns shown on the ground. Note that depending of difficulty levels you will or won't be able to outmatch bosses with your equipement, making every boss fights epic... so indeed "there will be something for everyone".\n\nYou can also accept quests from native aliens or  Juicebox (the robotic companion). Even if the tasks are often basics, it brings funny dialogues and many ways to expend your knowledge of the lore and crafting receipes. The more you take quests, the more you venture further on the planet. And it's a good thing because it brings some kind of "direction" in a game where the world and possibilities are enormous. Sometimes you can get receipes from enemies or ressources, making exploring and farming much more enjoyable. During night time new monsters appear giving you other receipes and challenges!\n\nAlso dialogues are a delight, totally in the mood of Battle Block Theater, Crashlands brings a fresh air. Punning all the time and makes you laugh with weird situations. Nothing is serious and it's where the game shines above many.\n\n\nLife span:Crashland is a long and interresting game. But be ware, you must be prepared to do some tasks often as what you can do in a game like Don't Starve but in a "friendlier" way. The only thing that might lack is a local or internet co-op mod.\nChallenge is decent and again there will be ways to play for everyones.\n\n\nFun/Stress aspect:Even if it can be difficult nothing is punishing or too important to bother you. You just enjoy and have choice to do things the way you want and at anytime. As an exemple, your base never gets raided or as promoted (and it's totally justified) your inventory manages itself. Even dying is not so hard because you just loose few items to forces you to walk a bit (the monster that killed you despawn leaving you chances to get your stuff).\nAlso you can teleport to your base and important locations at anytime and you don't need to feed, rest, ect your character. Food only serves to heal when you don't have passiv restorative effects on your armor or weapons.\n\nThe game and will only stress you because of movements with mouse during combats and forces you to do again an again what could have been easier... let's say more intuitive.\n\nCrashland is still amazingly funny and entertaining !\n\n\n\n\nTO CONCLUDE:\nI've posted that this game was the one i was waiting for this year.\nAnd indeed, Crashlands is the gem i was waiting for. Balanced and easy to pick up on every aspects (expect movement with the mouse ARGH). Crashland is a good addition to a genre that stays a bit too serious and even punishing sometimes. A great part of the game is about grinding but quests, dialogues and possibilities are excellent.\nBuilding a house has never been so easy, taming beasts is interresting, fights are tight enough to makes you come back again and again. Crafting is deep and funny. The game is beautifull and ridiculous enough to surprise you at every encounter.\n\nAllready a classic.","January 23","true","11.9"," 36 of 40 people (90%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","90","36","40","4","5"

"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198042913113/recommended/391730/","76561198042913113","caidicus","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198042913113/","353 products in account","Don't be fooled by the playtime, I've logged tens of hours on Android for this game.\n\nTL:DR You'd be hard pressed to find a game as rewarding and well-made as this one.\nThere's crafting, survival, cooking, fishing, building, questing, and plenty else to do in this game. Crashlands is REALLY good, and each of its mechanics is so well done, you'll wonder why other developers hadn't thought to do it this way.\n\nFor the full review, I'm going to break things down by mechanics and features. New players will also be able to learn some useful tips about the game, by reading this.\n\nSo, let's start with:\n\nStoryline and Gameplay\n\nFor starters, this game is pretty funny. It doesn't take itself seriously, and has jokes and humour littered througout. The thing is, it's all quite well done, and creates an enjoyable world to explore and discover. The characters you'll meet are often silly and entertaining, but not in any way that breaks immersion. Overall, it's very well done, and by doing the storyline quests and side quests, you unlock more recipes and ingredients to use to make your character even stronger.\n\nCrafting\n\nThe crafting system in the game is very well done. There are different crafting stations for different tiers of equipment and tools. There are a lot of similarities between this system and Starbound, however this one ups that by offering ideas that make it easier to craft. One of my favourite features of crafting is the ability to track a recipe. Click "Track" then you'll see what ingredients you'll need to craft that item. As you collect the ingredients, you'll see how much you have, and how much you still need, in order to make that item.\n\nRecipes are another fun aspect of the game as you start with a bunch when you make a new station. You can also get new recipes from finishing quests. My favourite feature, however, is that you can get epic and legendary recipes from resource drops, mob drops, and fishing. It's very rewarding to kill an enemy and suddenly see a recipe box pop out. It could be anything from a new piece of furnature for your house to a legendary blueprint for a piece of equipment.\n\nCrafting is this games' killer app, and it really is killer.\n\nExploration and Map\n\nExploration in Crashlands is very similar to Don't Starve. You start at your pod, and as you travel further out, your map gets filled in, block by block.\nThe further away you get, the more interesting (read:dreadly) the enemies become. Then again, the greater the risk, the greater the reward. There are lots of interesting places to discover, and NPC locations are littered everywhere, which results in gaining new quests, learning more about the planet you've crashed on, and of course, more recipes and lot.\n\nIt also helps that the art style in Crashlands is wonderfully colourful, with lots of glowy things that light up the world in a myriad of colours. Exploration is FUN FUN FUN in Crashlands.\n\nCooking and Fishing\n\nAt a certain point in the game, you're going to gain access to a hearth for cooking, and later, a fishing rod for fishing.\n\nUnlike a lot of games that have fishing spots randomly appear in different places, fishing spots are permanent in Crashlands. That means you can place signs (assuming you've crafted some) at any spots you find, and come back to them every two hours. At one point, I was using signs to label sites on the map, but eventually the game one upped that by giving me a recipe for an item that creates fishing spots in any body of water I choose.\n\nLet me remind you, fishing spots are pemanent, so these items were a Godsend, as fishing is not only very rewarding, it's also very enjoyable. Add to that the fact that you can also gain legendary items and recipes from fishing, and you have a system that will keep you coming back for more.\n\nFishing spot cooldowns will continue to count down, even when you're not playing the game, so long as you haven't left the game paused. Pausing the game and leaving it, unfortunately, also pauses timers. Bummer for sure, but this can be avoided by simply exiting the game when you walk away from it. The game saves everything automatically, so you won't lose anything by doing so.\n\nAs for cooking, when you use the hearth, you'll have a bunch of recipes for potions. Potions provide health, speed, resistences, etc. There are all sorts of boosts and benefits from potions, so you'll want to pursue that, when the hearth comes available.\n\nQuick tip: There's a quest, not long after you get the hearth, that'll allow you to make really good health potions out of fish and stone. If you have a rod and a hearth, but not this recipe? Do some quests, it's worth it... so worth it.\n\nBuilding\n\nBuilding is another great feature in this game. It's extremely simple to get some building supplies, then activate build mode which will allow you to click (or tap) anywhere on the screen to place that item.\nAdditionally, each building type is seperated into function. Floors have their own section, so it's easy to select that item set, choose a floor type, and just start pasting those floor tiles down the way you want.\nVegetation (farming... yes, this game TOTALLY has farming) is another section, and you can plant your seeds, and place potted plants which can both be harvested after a 15 minute cooldown.\n\nAgain, cooldowns will continue to count down while you're out of the game, so be sure to check back on your farms, from time to time.\n\nAnimal Taming\n\nHere is perhaps one of my favourite features of Crashlands, you can have pets! Pets serve two features. First, you can feed your pets to harvest resources from them. These resources can be used in certain recipes, and often come in really handy.\nThe second function, and perhaps the most important, you can take one of your pets out with you while you explore. They'll fight for you, while they keep you company. Additionally, they're invincible, so you don't need to worry about them getting killed by other baddies. They also don't need to be fed to stay aline, feeding is only something you do when you want to... milk them...\n\nHow about one more awesome point of keeping animals... Well, you can also unlock recipes for items that will cause your animals to permanently evolve into larger and more powerful versions. Each animal has multiple stages of growth, each one making them bigger, stronger, and look cooler, each time.\n\nYou should get an egg drop for each enemy type, shortly after you've crafted a station that can make that animal's nest.\n\nKeeping animals is absolutely worth it, in this game.\n\nLooting and Inventory\n\nThere's loot... lots and lots of loot. When you kill creatures, fish, harvest resources, etc, you'll get showerd with items and materials. The key point here is that there is not traditional inventory with a sprawling list of things you have and don't have. The inventory system manages all of that for you, and there is NO LIMIT TO INVENTORY SPACE. As you pick things up, they will scroll by discreetly on the left, along with a number in brackets which indicates how many you have in total.\n\nThe inventory system in Crashlands is another one of those features that makes you wonder why it has taken so long for a developer to think of it. It's clean, efficient, simple to figure out, and cuts out all the mess of traditional inventory spaces.\n\nAs mentioned before, all enemies, resource points, and fishing have a chance of dropping some epic items, so there will be a lot of "OMG That's AWESOME" moments in your adventures with Crashlands.\n\nSummary\n\nSeems I'm at the word limit for this review, so let me just sum it up by saying, Crashlands is one hell of a good game. It aces its presentation, mechanics, sense of rewarding, and enjoyment. If you haven't purchased it yet, do yourself a favour and get in on the fun.","February 26","true","0.8"," 38 of 46 people (83%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","83","38","46","3","1"

You won't starve, or go insane, your backpack can always contain more than you can gather, and your furniture do not burst into flames. However this does not mean this game is too easy. The death penalty is forgiving, but mobs are not. A mob can one hit KO you even if you are equiped with gears 10 levels higher or so on insane difficulty. Die dozens of times defeating a boss or sometimes a mob feels very good for me. The building system is very nice as well, containing a huge varities of different furnitures to make, just like in most sandbox games.

It's really awesome, check out: www.igda.org to see if there is a chapter in your city (If there isn’t one, you can start your own!) The very first time there- two cool dudes took the stage, Sam and Seth Coster…\nand they proceeded to describe an amazing game that they were working on and I remember thinking to myself holy ♥♥♥♥ that would be incredible!\n\nWell guess what???\nTHIS IS THAT ♥♥♥♥ING GAME!!\nAnd it truly is everything the Super Coster Bros described that fateful day.\n\nFrom a story aspect:\nRight off the bat, the dialogue will make you laugh out loud (LOL) and the humor never fails to deliver throughout the game! It’s much more story driven than the majority of crafting style games out there. It is filled with cute (and sometimes dangerous) little creatures and the NPCs you meet along the way really breathe character (pun intended) into the game (love that Juicebox). It really sucks you into the world. Also, the title is a great little pun (that you Crash-land, but you probably already noticed that).\n\nFrom a gameplay aspect:\nI’ve never played a crafting game with such smooth functionality, everything is so polished and the controls feel so… natural! I didn’t know if I would like that almost everything is mouse controlled (except for some quick select buttons) but they’ve integrated the majority mouse control style so well that I don’t miss the keyboard! (It appears to be very touch-screen ready, which will be fun to see if Crashlands makes it onto iOS and Android, and to have a ‘Deepworlds’ kind of situation where you can switch from playing on your computer to on your smartphone seamlessly). The combat is some of the best I’ve ever seen in mouse-only control scheme (really, the mouse movement does not hinder you at all), the enemies will show their red [damage] ring and you can dodge out of the way quite nicely, however it’s not that easy, every enemy has their own attack personality and you will find yourself getting to know each enemy on a personal level! The build mode is also really well designed, you can lay down floors, walls, etc with serious ease! Heck, just listening to the build mode music is worth it! I LOVE that you can “recycle” tools, weapons, buildings basically everything, and it will give you the resources back! Another great thing is finding schematics, you never know where or what you’re gonna find; all I can tell you is you will get super excited every time you see a crate! It gives you just enough to make the crafting aspect fair and actually enjoyable (it doesn’t feel so much like a chore, but more that you want to cut down ♥♥♥♥!) but it doesn’t spoon feed ya either!\n\nFrom a aesthetic aspect:\n(I’m not sure if I’m using that word correctly, what I mean to say is graphics/sfx/music all that audio/visual stuff) From the start you notice that Crashlands has a graphical style all its own and it is truly the trademark Butterscotch Shenanigans style that is unlike any other. (In fact, Sam did a presentation on how he uses Inkscape to make his awesome little creations) I find it refreshing to see these kind of unique graphic styles (don’t get me wrong, I love pixel art but it’s nice to see something new once in a while) there is a sort of ‘brutal cuteness’ to Crashlands and it fits the game’s personality like a [Wompi]glove! The music is excellent, composed by FatBard (another cool guy who did a presentation on game music at IDGA St. Louis) from the upbeat daytime music, to the soothing nighttime track and even the awesome build mode elevator muzak; it compliments the graphic style so perfectly! In fact, I feel as though the music is audible version of BScotch’s graphics (if that makes any sense at all). Everything down to the adorable little beeps and boops that characters make when you talk to them, to the epic “TOOL INTEGRATED” splashscreen, to just the quirky flavor-text of the items and tools (Baconweed™ is good for me!) everything ties together so magically delicious(ly).\n\nAll-in-all:\nEven though I might seem biased because I’ve met the Coster brothers (and they are REALLY AWESOME guys, super nice and funny, as you can imagine!) Crashlands really is an incredible little game (actually it’s not little, in fact the world is quite huge!) At first glance, it may seem like it shares many similarities with Don’t Starve, but the second you start playing you will find that Crashlands is such a unique and fun experience all its own. It is a testament to the true indie game; handcrafted by real-life brothers, who poured their hearts into this sweet little baby… And it shows!\nBest of luck BScotch Shenanigans, and CONGRATULATIONS on an awesome game!","January 21","true","1.9"," 10 of 16 people (63%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","63","10","16","6","0"

But what it does tell you is how seriously Butterscotch Shenanigans takes their game...\n\nAnswer: Not very\n\nWhat we have here is the aim to take out everthing tedious from world-sprawling RPG's... and just make them all about fun. So the guys blasphemously ripped out many of staples we're sick of... Letting us focus on the important things: Beating up the local wildlife and collecting stuff to make bigger stuff to beat up bigger local wildlife. So we no longer have to manage an unweildy inventory and angrily raid about 50 chests for that 1 item we know we picked up somewhere, but likely left in an outpost in God-knows-where (yay). The map is littered with teleporters that let us hop around the place on a whim (yay). And if you die, you can just go back, pick up your stuff and carry on (yay)\n\nOn the surface, this might seem worrying. By removing all this, does it leave a rather shallow game? Not really. What it ultimately does is make it exceptionally approachable and give you the freedom to muck about and just... enjoy it. Seriously, I could just mill about the Savannah for ages - it was just so relaxing. That's not to say it's easy (you will die... a lot), but it's laid back and easy to dip into.\n\nThe only real weak point is the armour crafting. Basically, your kit will randomly have special effects when you craft them (poisoning, going berserk, resisting damage...) - but it cannot be carried over when you upgrade. This sucks big time, as you'll repeatedly end up with Excellent Level kit... then have to forge like 30 items of the next level in the hope that one of them will actually have bonuses worth upgrading to. And you're forced to upgrade A LOT (the enemies scale quite dramatically). It ironically adds a lot of tedium to a game hell-bent on removing it. It's frustrating and can detract from the enjoyment - but there is at least enough enjoyment to be had to mitigate it to a degree.\n\nOther than that though, it's great fun! The combat is reminiscent of the old Mega Drive platformers: Studying the attack patterns and finding the sequences to best get a hit in. The pets are an inspired (and fun) addition and the writing is utterly wonderful. It's cheeky, playful and there are tons of laugh-out-loud moments to be had. The characters are brilliant and the item descriptions equally funny. The end is charmingly sweet and rounds it off perfectly.\n\nAll I can echo is the same thing I said to my partner smack-bang during my first boss fight: "Holy crap this game is so cool!" - (then buying her a copy immediately after)\n\nLittle tip... pay attention to the names (especially the Polari) - They snuck in a lot more jokes than meets the eye...","May 29","true","70.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It has good humor, a good story driven gameplay and some good old grinding/crafting/hack'n'slashing.\n\nI used to play one of their Android apps and it still is on my phone. When I discovered about this game I just had to buy it because they are good developers who seem to be committed to the game tha they work on. Crashlands is an example of their commitment. It is just fun.\n\nOne problem that I see for potential players is the grind. You will have to grind resources for stuff, thats fun for me but it might be too much for you. There are some odd technical decisions such as being able to control your character with the mouse only. Not too much of a problem though. You get used to the game very easily and after a while you get addicted to it. The combat can get a bit frustrating sometimes but I'm not that far into the game to judge the difficulty yet.\n\nI will keep trying the game and change my review accordingly but for now it is definately positive!\n\nAlso....

I really am enjoying it so far however the combat leaves a lot to be desired and is often more frustrating than fun. With as grindy as the game is, which i dont mind for its type but clicking dodging, clicking dodging, clicking dodging clicking dodging, clicking dodging, clicking dodging clicking dodging, clicking dodging, clicking dodging clicking dodging, clicking dodging, clicking dodging clicking dodging, clicking dodging, clicking dodging for just one enemy gets very tiresome, I still recommend the artwork id great and i really enjoy the devs sense of humor. I give it a 7/10 but only due to the fact combat gives me a headache and makes me want to punch a baby","January 22","true","12.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"

I checked the time, it was 21:10, it felt like 5 mins later I checked again and it was 22:20!\n\nThe boss fights are fantastic, it feels like Bloodborne or Dark Souls, you need to dodge every attack or it will punish you.\n\nHumour! Finally a game that isn't serious and has humour in it!\n\nThe items and enemies are pretty cool, there's alot of items to make/farm for.\n\nEnemies are every where!\n\nArt Style is pretty well made, goes with the game. It runs pretty smooth and feels very optimised.\n\nThere sadly isn't an XP system which is pretty dissapointing, the game does however have item levels (Wood level 2 to No Spoiler name level 9000 or something.) but it'd feel great leveling up your character and getting skill trees.","January 25","true","16.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I think it is more suitable to people who have too many time in their hands. There isn't a leveling system. It feels like a single player mmorpg whereby you need to hit damn a lot of monster and same monster just to farm to the next level of workshop. It is easy to craft certain item but it is also very hard to find those rare material for faming. Do not be despair whereby certain item is totally optional. I never get a single hair louse at all even though I finish the game. Also, try not to overfarm certain item, just get enough of it should be fine. There is more than 300 items in the game. Fastest way to win this game is to...\n\n1) Learn not to get hit at all. They practically 1 hit KO you if you don't have full set of armor, but the dodging is easy once you have 100% damage range weapon or more stun. Try get those eventually. There is a lot of different type.\n2) Aim for the next workshop/upgrade.\n3) All armor is optional once you learn (1). Just focus on weapon. I skipped a lot of armor building since it is a hassle to find those ingredient.\n4) MIssion is important, even it looks optional because certain recipe only can get from the quest. There are two quest I remember mission stucked is the Nitro(1st map) and the Thrombopump(3rd map) because I thought those are optional quest. So I ended up running around the map for no good reason thinking that the recipe will drop. It won't...\n\nI really like the pet system.

The total is much higher, as I initially could only get the game to play by adding it to Steam as a non-Steam game - thankfully this issue seems to have been resolved.  However, that initial issue did taint my experience, and it is for that reason that I wish Steam used more than a thumbs up/down ratings system.\n\nI like the game, it is interesting, fun, has music that doesn't grate on your nerves, with graphics that fit the overall "mood" and humor of the game.  What I don't like are the very grindy parts of the game, where it feels like someone picked a random high number, and said, "Go out and gather XXX of these before you can proceed."  Yes, some of the item quests have you gathering items in the three digits long area, and it can take quite a while indeed.\n\nI'm of two minds on the crafting and base building - partly negative due to the grinding for materials bit, partly positive because I like crafting (and the more items the better).  I wish the base building had more purpose other than cosmetic, as the description made it sound like mobs might try to enter your place if you had no walls, but I find that they come no where near it.  If they did, then something like turrets, alarms, etc. would be nice.\n\nNot an in-depth review, but just the first impressions after a few days with the game - my overall feeling is that this could have benefited from being an EA game, but it is still enjoyable, so a 3.75 out of 5...","January 27","true","5.1"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

The total is much higher, as I initially could only get the game to play by adding it to Steam as a non-Steam game - thankfully this issue seems to have been resolved.  However, that initial issue did taint my experience, and it is for that reason that I wish Steam used more than a thumbs up/down ratings system.\n\nI like the game, it is interesting, fun, has music that doesn't grate on your nerves, with graphics that fit the overall "mood" and humor of the game.  What I don't like are the very grindy parts of the game, where it feels like someone picked a random high number, and said, "Go out and gather XXX of these before you can proceed."  Yes, some of the item quests have you gathering items in the three digits long area, and it can take quite a while indeed.\n\nI'm of two minds on the crafting and base building - partly negative due to the grinding for materials bit, partly positive because I like crafting (and the more items the better).  I wish the base building had more purpose other than cosmetic, as the description made it sound like mobs might try to enter your place if you had no walls, but I find that they come no where near it.  If they did, then something like turrets, alarms, etc. would be nice.\n\nNot an in-depth review, but just the first impressions after a few days with the game - my overall feeling is that this could have benefited from being an EA game, but it is still enjoyable, so a 3.75 out of 5...","January 27","true","5.1"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

The biggest problem is that due to the need to grind for crafting resources it takes 40 hours to get through what should really be 15-20 hours of content.\n\nThe game is delivered in three Acts. The first act introduces most of the mechanics, story, and a mix of main and side characters. The second act introduces a few additional mechanics, a couple of new main characters, and tons of additional throw-away characters that you'll forget about after you've done their quest, but it's mostly grinding quests and resources for the occasional relevant story element. The last act, though, is pure grind with a drip feed of story until you can get to the final battle with the final boss in order to see the most predictable ending cut scene for that last bit of closure.","March 30","false","41.7"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","6","13","0","0"

It is awesome.\n\nI'm a story person, so that's what most impresses me about Crashlands.  Each of the game's biomes has a dominant culture, with its own stories, history and, no lie, values.  You get a few glimpses into the ancient history of civilizations that came before the ones you're helping now, too.  Lest this make you squint with the sudden suspicion that the game is anything less than a total blast, let me return to hilarious.  Crashlands' content is by turns aww-cute funny, terrible-pun funny, creepy funny, what-the-heck-surreal funny, and heaps of regular HA! funny.  You can do as many of the side quests as you want, or ignore all the NPCs' pleas and stay focused only on your main quest; I recomend doing every single side quest.  The whole experience is delightful.\n\nVisuals are wonderful -- nighttime lighting effects are particularly beautiful, and creature design is distinctive, expressive, and again, hilarious.  I want a stuffed slurb, for example, so badly it's probably illegal in most US states.  Slurbs are just the best.  They're bouncy little razor-snails with pointy spikes on their shells and three blinky eyes.  And slurb on slurb carnage -- I can watch my pet slurb bounce the tar out of another one. . . basically forever.  I will never get tired of that.\n\nMore great things:\nThere is a cat boss, and the cat boss has a really cool story that comes out during the boss battle\nPoison bombs, blood bombs, bombs made out of friggin seeds, bombs made out of bird fat, bombs made out of other bombs\nA creature that vomits its own explosive larvae at you\nTerrifying bug-things that split themselves into pieces, teleport the pieces, electrocute you with them, and reassemble themselves like that's a thing just anyone does on a Tuesday\nLaser deer (trust me)\nA sidequest series that seems like it's one of those little things that teach you how to play the game, basically, but then it sneaks up on you and becomes extremely emotional\nCreeping sentient fungus landscape\nA stat for your biceps\nDid I mention the cat boss?  The cat boss is awesome\nGet this game! It's not like you have important things you need to do in the next 3 or 4 weeks, anyway.","January 21","true","126.6"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","45","5","11","3","0"

Am I biased? Hm, hard to say. I'll just tell you what my opinion is.\n\nThe game itself is really big. 3 biomes and each of them is really big. Well you can just read this stuff in the description. The graphics are very crips, sound is spot on, controls... yeah I can't think of a better control layout, so good job! There also is a story, which is surprisingly entertaining. There seems to be over 50+ hours of content, and that is only the main story. 100+ with sidequests (I heard). You can craft hundreds of items, build your own house and can teleport all over the map with teleporters, so you don't have to walk all the way back! :O\n\nI simply bought both the iOS and Steam version (cross-save!). It is simply so worth it.\n\nJust a last note, but not less important: these devs are truly great human beings. This game is even realised from an idea of one of the developers who had cancer, as a last project. He very luckely beat the cancer! These 3 developers (3 brothers) are truly awesome. Who doesn't want to support them! And a funny thing is, they even made their best game yet!

Gameplay is fun and challenging, the story is immersive and goofy, and the world is massive and offers near-boundless opportunities to explore. I put over 30 hours of gameplay in just a few days during the beta and yet found myself only about halfway into the story in that time (I spent SO MUCH time doing side-quests and aimlessly exploring for the fun of it). Combat is satisfying, crafting is extensive and well-organized, and pets are loads of fun to domesticate and fight with. It's a purely fun experience that is an absolute delight to play.

Crashlands is like, literally one of the best games I have ever played, and I'm not just saying that. I don't want to write a huge review talking about the game, that is what you can learn from YouTube, I want to talk about the Dev. team, Adam, Sam, and Seth. These guys are f***ng amazing! They are literally the best, most friendly devs your ever gonna meet. The fact that Sam had to go through what he was going through, and they still wanted to make this AMAZING game, shows their dedication. They are extremely dedicated to helping their community, so much that, I was in constant communication with Adam over the past 2 days trying to sort out a connection problem that me and others were having. We ended up getting into a voice chat, and we got everything sorted out really quick, and found the solution that should work for everyone. These guys are so active on their forums, and Discord, you can almost always find at least one of them there to answer your questions.

It's incredibly polished, fun, silly and deep. It takes the best parts of several games (Diablo, Don't Starve, Terraria, Pokemon, Monster Hunter) and mashes them into something completely unique. On top of that, the ability to play on the PC and then carry on in the same place on my iPad (and vice versa) is fantastic.  It's also a bargain at its price - I've had more fun with it than most recent AAA titles. I've spent most of my time with the iPad version, but the Steam version plays exactly the same.

The humour is just my kind.\n\nExample:\nPlayer: Taste my sword!\nSidekick: What does it taste like?\nPlayer: Celery...actually.\n\nThere is a lot of "misuse" of the english language, which is a big part of the jokes. It suits me like a glove!\nThe characters you meet during your exploration are both funny and interesting.\nSome people say this game is "grindy" and gives it a negative review?\nWell what do you expect from a crafting game? I don't feel it is a problem, and it was also what I expected from it.\n\nThe crafting system feels very rewarding when you craft a piece of gear and it gets upgraded to epic quality, that's right. Whenever you craft a piece of gear, the quality can vary from 'white - green - blue and purple'. There are legendary items here as well, but from what I have seen so far, you get those from special recipe drops.\n\nI have not encountered any bugs AT ALL during my 10 hours of playtime. I am also still on the first biome of the planet. Not rushing through it. Taking my time to read all the dialog as I feel this is a big part of the game.\nYou will also find harvesting aspects in this title. At first I thought: Why bother? But I later found out that you will need these plants in later recipes, even the first flowers you encounter.\n\nAll in all? I give this game 9/10. Always leave room for improvement.\nI can wholeheartedly recommend this game!","January 21","true","18.5"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198147938484/recommended/391730/","76561198147938484","Rumpled Foreskin","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198147938484/","89 products in account","Boring, uncreative game with nothing else to it than "grind for a better weapon" or "grind for some better armour" add a pinch of totally cringy, uncreative puns which you could see from a mile away and a little bit of "fetch" quests or "kill that guy" quests and you got yourself this.... game?\n\nLet me explain.\n\nThe grinding in this game is repetitive and boring, and the only interesting part about it is the "combat" that you get into every once in a while while trying to get some resources to get some COMPLETELY RADICAL armour (a.k.a. beat some trees for ten minutes then craft some wooden armour which boosts your health by 1) Seriously, the combat in this game is atrocious and feels like a mobile game. OH WAIT... It's a port! Oh boy! You just know its gonna be a great game when its a port!.... Besides that, the combat is literally just dodge the red area and smack your enemy a couple of times, then run away like a ♥♥♥♥♥... repeat, repeat, blah blah blah. It's fun at first, but then it gets boring.\n\nBuilding in this game is non-existant. You place down a couple of grass foundations and thats all you'll need for the rest of the game.... literally. No enemies attack your base, and the foundations just provide somewhere to put the ten trillion crafting tables that youll make throughout the game, so whats the point of actually making a house other than some foundations? Sure, maybe you'll get a couple of stray animals wondering into your house, but by the time your base is that big that animals start wandering into it by accident you'll already have a weapon that can one-shot them in that area that you built in. Building any more than a couple of foundations is just a waste of precious resources.\n\nThe UI is slick and clean, easy to get used to even in PC, nothing to complain about here.\n\nThe story is rather predictable. Your ship gets highjacked by some super powerful alien creature, you crash land on this planet, blah blah blah. Just bland and predictable.\n\nThe.... "jokes" and "dialogue" is, well, a joke! The "jokes" consist of, like I said, puns that you can see from miles away, even before the dialogue starts. And the dialogue is nonsensical. Unknown space aliens that speak a completely different language than you? Fluently speak english no problem! I know thats a little nitpicky, but I couldn't help but just notice that whenever I spoke with them. It just felt wierd.\n\nThere are overpowered creatures in noobie areas with essential resources. Its not bad to have a challenge in a game at all, heck, a nice overpowered enemy is great to have in games like these. But when thier widespread in the exact area as the place you need to be in, it's just stupid. I cannot tell you how many times I was killed by those stupid octopus ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s every single time I tried to grind some stone to progress a little in the game. Its just so stupid! Why would you have them in such a key area! Like I said, it's nice to have a challenge, it's just the fact that you have it in such an area that it's just stupid! Speaking of challanges...\n\n\nThere is no immenent threat! There is no reason to grind, build a house, find something to eat, nothing! You can win this game by standing completely still! They say they removed everything that made a survival-rpg bad, but in reality instead of keeping the core essence of a survival game (starvation, thirst and immenent threats) they just removed it all and they still called it a survival-rpg in the end. A survival game is not a grind simulator, it's a game where you need to eat and drink and build a shelter to survive, not slap some grass until you get a new weapon or piece of armour. This game is just, in reality, a grindy RPG that feels badly executed, trying to be something it isin't.\n\n\nIf you like ♥♥♥♥♥♥ puns, fetch quests and smacking ♥♥♥♥ with various objects for multiple hours on end then this is the game for you!\n\n\n\n","June 3","false","2.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Now imagine that child grew up and got hours more content than its parents, and got rid of all the emotional "inventory management" baggage their parents were carrying. Then he joined a comedy club and acquired an actual storyline that doesn't suck.\n\nHe also saw his parents involved a lot of walking across half the procedurally generated map just to collect a few things or to retrieve your inventory after dying, so decided you can teleport freely wherever one of the generously spaced warp pads are, and that death (which if you're playing on Insane, will happen A LOT) doesn't mean dropping literally everything you own.\n\nThe child then decided being only on PC sucked, so it visited iOS and Android and was smart enough to get vaccined against the dreaded "IAP" disease that was endemic there.\n\nThat child is Crashlands.\nIt has a few flaws (like why don't more people know about this game aaargh) and minor bugs, but this is one of the most flawless indie sandbox releases I have seen on Steam, especially with all the pre-alpha early access nonsense going on lately. Right off the bat it has content rivaling Terraria and Don't Stave, with combat and gear resembling an aRPG, without the micromanagement chores of either (although if you are playing on higher difficulty levels and want to min-max your gear you will have to grind some).\n\nIt has an infinite procedural map, easy building, tons of crafting recipes, sensible progression, a long storyline, quests and side-quests, farming, fishing, pets, interesting combat, boss fights, rare loot and unique legendary gear, a unique social platform called BscotchID, achievements that unlock side-content IN OTHER GAMES, and WHY ARE YOU STILL HERE GO BUY IT ALREADY AAAAAHHH.\n\nThis review alone doesn't do this glorious child-comedian-genius justice so check out the other reviews if you're not yet convinced.","January 23","true","36.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I supported them for years, and they grew so much. Finally, they relased their first Steam game, and it's amazing!\n\nCombat\nThe combat an interesting concept, which you run away to doge enemy attacks and then attack them. Different enemies have different attacks, in which you would need to avoid by running away from the red on the ground. So for combat I rate a 8.5/10.\n\nDialouge/Characters\nThe dialouge has very good humor and is pretty immersive. All character have their attitudes and personalities. The characters you can get atttached to and do quests for. For Dialouge/Characters I rate 9/10.\n\nProgress\nThe progress is not too slow and not too fast, but just the right amount so that you do alot of quest fairly quickly and don't complete the story in 1 hour! For Progress I rate 9.5/10.\n\nSumming up\nIn conclusion the game has exicting combat, vibrant characters, and a great formula for progress. I rate 9.5/10 for the entire game.

If the waterfall of those positive reviews hasn't sold you yet, though, this probably will:\n\nCheck out the hours of record for the reviewers.  (At the time of this review, I've put in 46 hours: 15 on laptop, 41 on mobile.)  And I'm one of the light-weights.\n\nThe fact is that this game has crazy playability, which is rare for an indie title.  Most indie games that get noticed, much like independent films, tend to have tons of artistic merit and critical acclaim but nevertheless lack the plain fun and replayability of big studio productions.  CRASHLANDS IS DIFFERENT.\n\nPart of what makes the game hard to put down is its balance.  Good games strike a magic balance between challenge and reward, giving us that wonderful sense of satisfaction and accomplishment.  For me, at least, Crashlands hits a sweet spot.  Whether I was Level 1 or 31, I always had a good mix of easy, challening, and just-out-of-reach objectives.\n\nAnother thing making the game hard to put down, is, well, how easy it is to put down.  With the "crossplatforminess" between my laptop of phone, I've played Crashlands in 2 minute spurts and evening-sucking marathons.  Although the game has dozens of hours of content, cloud syncing and that great balance of objectives makes it easy to fit that playtime into your schedule.","January 21","true","16.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The game is so far well written and there is tons to explore. I can see a lot of hrs sinking in to this one. Quests can be a bit confusing at first. Espicially figuring out what you need to complete one if it's been more than 20 minutes since you got it. A little summery of what you need to do would be nice. But this is no way hindering the fun of exploring and slapping tons of monsters. Maybe my view will change over time, so far from the end game.

Not had an ARPG excite me this much in quite some time. I was a tiny bit skeptical with no levelling/abilities, but after playing it, you can choose up to 4 items/weapons to bring into combat with you on the fly, that change how you action in combat, plus the tinkering with trinkets.\n\nThe humour is spot on, there's never a few minutes where I'm not chuckling to myself with the witty writing. The story is compelling, and there is definitely a mechanic that makes you scream the antagonist's name out in rage through just normal world exploration. Won't spoil why.\n\nOverall, a very solid experience, would heavily recommend to anyone interested in RPGs in general, and even then if you're not interested in RPGs, I'd still recommend it to a high degree. The game is painstakingly beautifully crafted, and you can see it just after spending an hour playing.","January 22","true","41.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Ah, sorry *Shakes Head* wrong game again..\n\nWell, then how about the crafting menu *Pfft* talk about confusi.... *Scratches Head* Ah...ha....Ahem...\n\nOh and the bugs, god this game has SOOOOOO many bugs........ Blue ones, green ones, greeny bluey glowey ones...\n\nBasically you have an unlimited amount of space in your back pack, you can portal travel to anywhere on the map (where you found a portal) the crafing menu is brilliant, in that its not too complicated to follow.\n\nYou can track (have on the main screen) the components of what you need for your next craft, I know others have said they would like to track more than 1 thing, so far i havent FELT like i needed to but im sure the further I go the more of a necessity it will be.\n\nThe map is HUGE, and i know we've heard this before, but im not talking GTV5 or farcry4 huge, im talking huge HUGE, when i first saw the 'map' alot of it is clouded over until you go to it, when i was about 3/4hrs in and id run around, alot, i realised, hang on, *stares at scroll wheel* if i just....Oh wow, ok, yup thats a BIG map.\n\nWASD keys are not used to move around (unless your IN the map), you point & click on where you want you little Guy to go, I can see why some find this annoying but I actually liked the fact I couldnt just scroll around using my mouse or WASD keys to see what was around, i just had to man up *pummels chest* and go look for myself!\n\nIt has an element of dont starve to it, but in my opinion this was how just strave should have been made.\n\nI honestly think this is the first 'Brand New Out' game i have bought that i have had NOT ONE ISSUE with!\n\nThe music, cant be that annoying as i cant say even now, as i try to tell you what its like, i cant remember, so for me thats a plus! I normally mute games like this becuase of the ear bleeding elevator music but this one seems ok :)\n\nThe ONLY gripe i have is that you dont have a mini map on the main screen (and this was what i was thinking 2hrs into the game) until i found my scroll wheel, and *Durrrr* now i get why (please refer back to this map is HUGE for the reason why it wouldnt work)\n\nAs i progress futher in I'll update this review becuase from what i can see, there is ALOT more i have to do.\n\nCan really see that alot of hard work & genuine love has gone into this game and it doesnt matter how many other companys 'Say' this, its what shines through when you play it and this, just ticks every box.\n\nAnyway ive wasted 10 minutes writing this review when i could have been playing\n\nEdit - Too many new games get too much negative publicity from small stuff that can/is being fixed - if people keep trampling on the good guys were going to be overrun with IAP crap games.. So before you give a negative think really long an hard on if its a genuine negative, or just cause you didnt get any last night?\n\nRating : 10/10 would defintaly buy on a work day and procrastinate again!","January 22","true","8.7"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Its both relaxing and challenging at the same time. That parts sort of hard to explain unless you actually play the game i think over time you will understand what i mean. It to me is very reminiscent of Dont Starve except theyve taken all the parts of that game that were kind of stressful streamlined them and made a totally new game.The best part is unlike DS its not a one shot if you die you can run back to your corpse and pick up your loot you dropped. So it feels a lot more relaxed and less stressful and to me at least a LOT more enjoyable way of doing this type of game. The games got quirky humor which im really enjoying and it has a straight forward quest system as well as a very in depth crafting system which is the main point of the game it seems. Ive so far highly enjoyed my time playing this game and if you get the chance pick it up too its a great game!","January 23","true","17.2"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

"Whoa, you smacked an egg right out of that Wompit". I screenshotted it and laughed.\n\nPROs:\nInfinite inventory (this actually sold me on the game more than anything)\nNo item decay (broken weapons, tools, etc)\nSlapping\nCrafting items gives random bonuses so if you craft the same sword twice it will have different stats\nGood atmospheric music\nFunny story without trying really hard to be funny (the reaction to pet milking was spot on)\nCan teleport around the map at will\nPets that fight with you\nCross platform works great (playing your saved cloud game on mobile and vice versa)\n\nNegatives: Nothing stands out to me at all\n\nI like this game quite a bit. So much that after I bought here it I bought the Android version and another copy of the steam version for my son. I am an old codger and I don't usually get the appeal of games like this because they are always so tedious; limited inventory, item decay, starving/dying = game over. Not in Crashlands. They basically streamlined the process for people like me who think "I would like to play a crafting game that has a story and focuses on discovering new items and not annoying ♥♥♥♥ like having too much stuff to carry and needing to eat and stuff". It's like Don't Starve but not as unforgiving for people like me that are casual noobs with a limited amount of time to play every day. I think you should buy this game.\n\nSide note: I'd like to thank the makers of this game for having MADE A TRAILER THAT ACTUALLY SHOWS YOU WHAT THE GAME IS ABOUT INSTEAD OF A BUNCH OF STUPID CUTSCENES THAT HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH GAMEPLAY.","January 22","true","1.5"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

The best parts are the humor (dialogue is hysterical), how streamlined it is so you can just focus on enjoying the game, and how well it scales. It continues to be a challenge throughout while not being too difficult. A ton of RPG's just take time to figure them out and then you have to grind away to win. Crashlands keeps changing and keeps you really engaged because it's not just repeating the same things over and over.\n\nThe music is a great compliment and the creature noises are *rarely* annoying.

Contrary to most reviews I've read which is the opposite. Why? Because although it IS like DS, the integral part of that game that make it so effective is gone. There is no necessity to harvest resources fast and effectively, or build a base that can hold off creatures. You dont feel the need to explore to find more valuable resources.\n\nInstead you are dropped in a planet, where you can survive by just standing still. You can build a base, but totally just because you can, not because you have to.\n\nAnd then there's the humor. Maybe it was just lost on me, but this game's humor is totally lost on me.\n\nThe whole game feels like a long, un ending, un entertaining fetch-quest that has 0 gratification.\n\nTL;DR version:\nIf you REALLY want it, get it when it's on sale. Probably when it's 90% off.","February 19","false","3.4"," 10 of 28 people (36%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","36","10","28","0","7"

The menus, combat, crafting, and gameplay are overly simple and leave a lot to be desired.\n\n- With no skills and just basic items, the combat gets old within an hour or two.\n- No way to change what craftables are being tracked without going back to crafting table\n- No hover-over info in the UI, something ARPGs have had for over 20 years. You have to click an item to view its properties or what it is (You also can't hover over items in your tracked craftables, there also is no hotkey to move back in a menu, you have to press back). You also have to be at a crafting station to see what materials you have to craft with.\n- Quest log is primitive and often not always clear what you're supposed to do.\n- Crafting is on a time-based system. Appropriate for a phone maybe, but a waste of time and design on the computer.\n- Combat is so basic that it becomes easy to master within minutes and never die.\n\nOverall this game is probably fun if you spent $2 on it and played on your phone, but as a full-fledged steam release I expected more and feel underwhelmed and accepting of my loss of money.","January 26","false","3.2"," 18 of 47 people (38%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","38","18","47","0","6"

You can craft bombs that do 75% of your damage which is useless on single targets (and you can't fight more than one with the speed of their attacks and the dodging required).\n\nThe rest of the game is running around collecting things and crafting.\n\nThat's literally all there is to the game.\nTedious oversimplified combat and lots of padding.\nThere is no real game here.\n\nThe humor is great and really drew me in, and there is lots of grinding/padding/crafting/upgrading to keep players looking towards the next big thing, but the game itself is not fun to play.\n\nAlso, the game suffers with controls designed for mobile.\n\nI didn't have any crashes and the graphics are colourful, although there is almost no variety in the ground types or mobs. and no real biomes to speak of. I ran south for 1 hour and everything was basically the same except some of the mobs changed colour and got larger. In terms of stability the game is mostly good, but it does freeze for up to a minute when you open the map if you have not opened it in a while which is really annoying.\n\nOverall, the game is polished, looks nice and has humorous elements, but is a padded grindfest with no real gameplay to speak of and ultra tedious combat.\nGrab it on sale to relax with but don't expect too much.\n\nRight now I cannot recommend it.","January 22","false","1.8"," 58 of 137 people (42%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","42","58","137","4","20"

Simply put the game is a poor mans don't starve with a quirky personality. you will find it extreamly grindy, way more then you find it in don't starve. i Refrence don't starve becase in large part the reason i purchased this game was its similarities and its quirky take on the genre.\n\nhere is what i found 18hrs in: your given a melee weapon that will continue to be your main attack(confirmed by dev) and then you have active items you can use. So far i have found a wrench that is throwable that stuns and a mirror that stuns. all combat pretty much comes down to hit mob 2 times run away and repeat. In many ways you will find your pet to be if not your main sorce of damage deffinatly close. To some extent you will use bombs etc but its not going to be primary or even secondary in combat.\n\neach biome has 5 or so mobs you will be in that biome for 8 to 12hrs. quests are simple...extreamly simple. eace biome resets your progress to newb, something most games do it just doesnt do a good job of hiding it.\n\nthe end point is if your looking for a much simpler don't starve and are not against extreme grind then this game may work for you.\n\nI do not review this on what the game could potentally be i review it on what it is day one.","January 21","false","18.1"," 46 of 132 people (35%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","35","46","132","5","13"

I like the art style, the animations and effects all seemed pretty cool. However, after an hour and some minutes into the game, it started to feel far too grindy and I would spend too long doing the same things with very little variation. It might just be the case that later into the game things got less grindy, but reading some reviews it led me to believe that they wouldn't. The game shows a lot of potential, however, it needs to tone down on the grind and increase variety. For the whole hour I spent with the game, I killed the same monters (2 types) and chopped the same resources, over and over.\n\nI think this is the product of having only resources you can collect and monsters you can actually defeat near your "current level area". This means, since you need to gather that item or fight this monter, you'll see almost exclusively those types of elements as you progress through the tiers, creating a feeling of "too much of the same, over and over".\n\nIn short, I think the game is fun, but to me, too repetitive.","January 22","false","1.2"," 20 of 80 people (25%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","25","20","80","0","4"

Maybe if there were an incentive to make bases (see: houses in terraria) or more secret stuff (see: that time I fished up a purple wep - AWESOME!) or even I dunno, randomly generated sub zones, caves, more loot, just something to want to explore for.\n\nOverall it's a thumbs up because for the first 15 hours my partner and I were both hooked, so it already gave us value for money despite boredom eventually setting in.","February 23","true","44.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Then Crashlands happened.\nLately I've grown tired of gaming, don't know why. Even Fallout 4 is just laying around and not getting played at all.\nThen Crashlands happened. A game that isn't my most favorite genre and didn't peak my interest until TouchArcade shed some light on the game including the touching backstory (developer with cancer) fueling the entire creation of this very game together with his two fellow brothers.\nThis is also why I decided to not only purchase it for iOS, but also Steam.\n"Yeah ok," you might be wondering "...but is the game any good? Especially when it's not really your genre?" Heck yeah it is!\nThis game is so incredible that I've already played almost 12 hours in total and only just now I've finished the required quest to move on to the second biome in the game.\nIf you love the art, music and humor presented to you in the trailer speaks to you, then please don't hesistate. Buy it!\nPersonally, I just can enjoy spacing out endlessly whacking away at resources and enemies. The game works for any mood you are in, which makes it so accessible. You can play it for minutes, or hours, also a key feature to make a game accessible.\nAnd perhaps the most exciting part is the extra polish and features this game is going to receive over the next few updates to come. Not to mention the Campaign Creator tool so that users can create their own campaigns for the game!\nIt's already fantastic in it's current state, and both the creators and users are going to make sure this well won't run dry anytime soon.

What?? I paid $20 for this game I don't want to wait 5 minutes for my helmet to craft. It's a completely pointless and tedious feature that annoys me every time I go to craft something. Also there is no way to view your inventory, and the developers have stated on Reddit that they have no plans to include a way to view your entire inventory. What?? What kind of crafting based game which relies completely on what is in your inventory doesn't allow you to see your inventory??? The only way to see what items you have is to teleport to your base and open up a crafting station with the recipe in it. It's stupid and pointless.\n\nThis is also a game that would be amazing with multiplayer but the developers have stated that they have 0 plans to bring in a multiplayer update.\n\n9/10, could be a 10 but these developers have made some really questionable, and borderline stupid decisions with this game.","January 24","true","10.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Then Crashlands happened.\nLately I've grown tired of gaming, don't know why. Even Fallout 4 is just laying around and not getting played at all.\nThen Crashlands happened. A game that isn't my most favorite genre and didn't peak my interest until TouchArcade shed some light on the game including the touching backstory (developer with cancer) fueling the entire creation of this very game together with his two fellow brothers.\nThis is also why I decided to not only purchase it for iOS, but also Steam.\n"Yeah ok," you might be wondering "...but is the game any good? Especially when it's not really your genre?" Heck yeah it is!\nThis game is so incredible that I've already played almost 12 hours in total and only just now I've finished the required quest to move on to the second biome in the game.\nIf you love the art, music and humor presented to you in the trailer speaks to you, then please don't hesistate. Buy it!\nPersonally, I just can enjoy spacing out endlessly whacking away at resources and enemies. The game works for any mood you are in, which makes it so accessible. You can play it for minutes, or hours, also a key feature to make a game accessible.\nAnd perhaps the most exciting part is the extra polish and features this game is going to receive over the next few updates to come. Not to mention the Campaign Creator tool so that users can create their own campaigns for the game!\nIt's already fantastic in it's current state, and both the creators and users are going to make sure this well won't run dry anytime soon.

There was a third ract too, also awol.

To be honest, I should have played it a bit more on my phone before I paid the $15 to play it on steam.  After 40 hours of playing it, I've gotten pretty bored of it.  I forced myself several times to try and get back into it; just couldn't do it.  I'd play 10 minutes, let out a big sigh, and then quit.  It gets repetitive and tedious and there's not a lot more going on in my opinion.   That alone though doesn't deserve a non-recommendation.\n\nPROS:\n- art style\n- story\n- interesting enemies that have unique attacks that you need to learn and adjust to, and fighting them is a blast\n- PETS!!!\n- cool secondary weapons (like flamethrower, razorblade/boomerang thing, etc.)\n- base building gives you a chance to be creative, but in my opinion gets pointless later on, especially when you're not defending it from anything\n- humor\n\nCONS:\n- gets grindy and tedious\n- crafting armors and weapons isn't all that interesting; i spent quite a bit of time gathering materials to get the best tier (purple) armors and weapons.  i crafted the best armors and weapons, but half an hour later I needed to create new workbenches to craft even better armors and weapons, so there is really no point trying to craft the highest tier items (it's all about those secondary weapons). you can craft legendary items, but even those get weak real quick.  the armors and weapons you craft have different resistances and effects, which is cool.\n\n=======\n\nalthough I didn't finish the game and got bored of it, i still recommend it for people who are into these types of games.  i never played Don't Starve, but people are saying they are similar; so if you like Don't Starve, there is a good chance you'll like this game too.\n\njust my opinion.  7/10","March 7","true","32.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I played 14 Hours straight in a single sitting, and I can't wait to jump back in for more. I've always enjoyed challenging games, so I started on the 3rd Difficulty (out of 4), and it feels great. Having to be quick and know enemy patterns and attacks leads to fun and rewarding combat. The bosses I have fought so far have had unique and interesting mechanics and keep you clenched the entire fight. The writing is absolute gold. I haven't seen writing as well as this in quite some time. I dabbled a little in the mobile (Android) version, and while it is the same game, combat is much harder to control on touch devices, so I wouldn't recommend playing on a higher difficulty on mobile, unless you're just farming materials or fishing.\n\nI can't wait to see what the devs have planned for this games future.

After that, you turn off your audio for the game.\n\nPros:\n- I found myself bulding a base I actually cared about in a game I didn't care about. The building/crafting system is very logical.\n- Teleportation system. Very well thought out. Sets you right outside of the quest zone in a very linear map. It encourages you to explore while also taking the tedious bits out.\n- Fun pets! I want to emphasise this. Fairly early, you are given the option for pets. Each pet is unique and different. You will need to raise & nurture your pet to fully expand it's skills. It adds a unique dimension to the RPG.\n- Gameplay depth. I could easily spend 40 hours to get the most out of this game.

It gains it's similarities of starbound (or terraria and probably many more games.) based on the 1.resourse collection 2.move up an equipment/ cravting station tier list.\n\nThose are both really good things but like I mention previosly, the combat is what makes this game feel unique.

Even the grinding in the game is fun and it feels like it's perfectly balanced in every way. Each tier has new weapons and armor (with random buffs on each piece which are different each time you craft them), there's dozens of quests and some comedy scattered throughout everything too. The immense amount of detail about every object is amazing, each has it's own texture and description, (which most people probably look over but I think the items' captions are one of the funniest parts of the game). I've only had the Crashlands for a few days but it's already in my top three favourite games, if you're looking to buy this game I can't recommend it enough","January 29","true","34.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

They help a lot in battle and they are pretty awesome. Gotta catch em all.\n> Cool weapons designs! The addition of the projectile sidearm is nice too.\n> Hours of fun!\n> Enemies are well balanced according to the story progress\n> The boss battles! I have only had one boss battle encounter, but man was it fun. New enemy type, unique fighting style, it's really great, and the rewards you recieve afterwards make it feel worthwhile too.\n> Cool unique armor you can create\n> building mode runs extremely smoothly and it's part of exploring too, you can cross over water. It's a pretty neat idea.\n\nCons:\n> Holy ♥♥♥♥♥ there are so much grinding. Grinding to get material to build your dream house and for quest progression items, grinding to get egg drop so you can have the pets, grinding for quests, you will have to kill hundreds and thousands of enemies of the same type, and watch your character chop the same type of wood and stones for hours if you want to build something cool.\n> Lack of quest marks. You will just have to remember the questgiver's name and the location name that the questgiver is at. Or you will have to teleport around until you find them.\n> You discover the map locations by walking around, the unexplorered areas are black. Makes sense, but it's pretty annoying when you walked around just to get a complete map. Wouldn't it be nicer just to have the map to begin with, but walking around shows you the new discovered locations?\n> The music is pretty repetitive and isn't very exciting. However it is something you will have to listen to for hours while you play this game. I suppose it is better to be something you can tone out. At least it's not annoying\n> There are more things crafting system can be used for. This game is pretty much RPG game with some sandbox element in it, but it can be so much more! The crafting system runs so smoothly but There aren't a lot you can craft that seems neat or useful at the same time. It would be nice if there is more interactive home decorations.","January 27","true","35.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/StagedKhan/recommended/391730/","StagedKhan","StagedKhan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/StagedKhan/","115 products in account","Alright, let me start off by saying this... Within moments it became one of my new favorite games!\n\nI just recently bought this game, it's appearance and play style can be compared to that of Don't Starve,another game in which that i've played. This is a fairly good sized review but it's worth it if you consider to know more before you buy.\n\nAssuming all possibilities i started it up, you start on a ship, a delivery ship in fact and play as the character Flux, someone whos appearance is like deadpools but in a goofy/ cute kind of style, and you have your robot Juicebox, who believe it or not looks like a robotic juicebox, and you're currently in progress of delivering several packages to it's destination until you are visited by this just plum like floating head alien Hewgodooko, who at first doesn't seem that bad while asking for an energy source until Flux and Juicebox tells him that its on the ship but in order to get it it would result in blowing up the ship. So he then shoots your ship with a giant laser, blows it up and takes what he needed leaving you (flux) and Juicebox to stumble off of the ship, while along your way to get off you learn basic combat knowledge and health maintance which again is similar to that of Don't Starve, but it has its own special touch to it but i'll tell you more about that in a bit.\n\nSo you make it into an escape pod and go to the planet below where you "Crashland" *nudge* *nudge* and start to explore, and that's where you learn the collecting/crafting mechanics. Very simple to do and kind of fun, you start getting neccessities to make what you need to survive i.e saws,armors, weapons, etc. All doing so with an infinite and self maintaining inventory system where it'll make crafting super easy. Now on to the enemies, the first actual creature/animal you meet is a cute donkey/cow like creature with one leg by the name of Wompit, one of the many creatures that you'll come to meet and learn about along the way with different appearances and strengths. Now combat system, again I'll relate it back to Don't Starve and how its point,click,attack but what seperates is how the enemies react to it, each creature and being has its own attack, I'll explain the wompit's; it's attack is a stomp creating a circle of splash damage to those within reach, now when an enemy attacks it'll create a blue colored highlight (circle,line,line then circle) and when it goes on the attack that path/highlight will turn red, giving you a chance to dodge that attack and deal damage at the same time which honestly takes a bit to get down especially when no two different animal species attacks are the same, so watch out!\n\nOn top of everything else there's quest's and villagers that you can help and work with and complete to get extra stuff.\n\nFor my rating of this I would flat out give it a 10/10 for at this point i've only played 5-ish hours but yet have merely scratched the surface of that which is Crashlands. I hope that my review was helpful to all those who eye gaze at this game and like me, choose to give it a shot :) you have my honest word when i say it's worth every penny, enjoy!","January 27","true","6.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Well i must say that it has consumed a lot of my free time for the past week. The game has a complulsive quality to it. Just five more minutes I tell myself only to quit two hours later. It pulls in ideas from Minecraft, Diablo and World of Warcraft. Yes, its derivitive, but what game isnt these days? It bucks the recent trend for rock hard perma-death games which I find really refreshing. I have always loved rogue type games but of late they have gotten too hard. I like to commit my free time but not to something that wipes out all my hard work when i make mistakes. Starting again from scratch I find far too frustating and I lose the will to play again. I guess the closest resemblance to recent games is Don't Starve, which I found a brilliant idea but ultimately i found it depressing. Quite apart from my character going mad every time it was far too hard and no fun after a while.\n\nCrashland takes all these ideas and re-jigs them and the guys from the briliiantly named Butterscotch Shenanigans have produced a masterpiece (in my humble opinion). They then go one further and pull out yet another brilliant coup - they release it on multiple systems. This means that nerds like me can play the same game, nay the same game save on different systems!! Crashlands is on IOS, Android, Mac and PC. So i can start on my ipad, move to my Macbook Air when I fancy a change, then I can take the same game out on the road on my phone!! Wow!\n\nWhat else? How long have you got? The game has an unlimited inventory. Collect everything to your hearts content. Want 500 blocks of wood, then go for it. The game also puts the right tool into your hand depending on what you are doing. For example, strike a tree and an axe comes to your hand, strike a rock and you automatically produce a pickaxe, hit a critter and your weapon miraculously comes to hand!\n\nYou also dont have to juggle stuff you own. The components you collect from scavanging and killing critters are listed briefly in a text panel over on the left of the screen then that is the last you see of them. You work with recipes instead, 500 of them in all, that are accessed by the numerous workstations that you also make. A recipe might need, ten sawgrass, three waterballoons and some glue. If you have all the components you can make it, as many as you have bits for. If not then the game tells you that you have x of whatever missing. So you go out and find it.\n\nYou also find eggs while out hunting. Find a recipe for an incubator and you can make it, then use it to hatch the egg. If you hatch a wompit you can create a nest and put it on it and then milk it! Yes milk it, Eugh! - you milk a one legged dog thing! Why? Because later in the game that milk is a vital ingredient in yet another recipe. The recipes themselves come from randoms drops mostly from kills while hunting. You also get the more important ones from completing quests. These are the workstations, the armour and the weapons and the major tools.\n\nYou will note I have said nothing about the plot or the setting. I wont either, suffice to says its ingenius and what starts out simple spins out into some grander. just do yourself a favour and buy it. Now!\n\nTo date I have clocked up 15 hours. So that leaves me 45 hours of playtime left according to the developers. I am still in the first map/biome. In one of the dev diaries which you can readily find on the net it takes eight, yes eight hours in realtime to walk from one side of one map to the other side! Thats mind bogglingly big. There are three maps!\n\nI have played, in my considerable number of years of gaming life, very very few games for multiple hours, WOW, Wild Arms, FInal Fantasy games (all 14 of them) and Xenoblade Chronicles but never, apart from Alto, any game for so long on an ipad. Even on Alto i have only clocked up five or so hours. Crashlands has stolen the crown. It really is the bees knees and deserves to be played by everyone.\n\nAre there any negatives? Well its a grind at times, but then I settle into the groove as i inch my way towards 140 blocks of stone and that blasted Wompit essence that was such a trial to get because the goal is so tantilising - a Wompit Garter which turns litle Chomp into a killing machine. So even the negatives turns into a plus.\n\nI could go on, and on but I am feeling the itch to play. I want that level 7 helm but one component, a tiny blue flower bud, is so rare that I am having to trawl the entire map. When I do find it where it grows I will be sure to mark the map so after i harvest it I know where to go when it grows back. And that says it all, the total attention to detail the BS guys have poured into this game across the three years of its development.  Read their story too. Its quite moving.\n\nThe game is a wonder - go play.","February 3","true","19.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The building/crafting system is very logical.\n- Teleportation system. Very well thought out. Sets you right outside of the quest zone in a very linear map. It encourages you to explore while also taking the tedious bits out.\n- Fun pets! I want to emphasise this. Fairly early, you are given the option for pets. Each pet is unique and different. You will need to raise & nurture your pet to fully expand it's skills. It adds a unique dimension to the RPG.\n- Gameplay depth. I could easily spend 40 hours to get the most out of this game.

If you want a cool, funny, and friendly exploration, crafting, and combat experience with a simple but still deep mouse-click interface, this is a brilliant choice. Happy that this was made by two guys and that we can support each other - devs give us experiences that make us happy, we support their careers. That's how humanity should work overall. This is a very human game. Highly recommended. It is a little challenging, so take their advice and play on easy if you just want the humorous story and some challenge. I'm playing on normal and those wompits can be tough at first!\n\nLess than an hour in already 8.5/10","February 6","true","5.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/owenm28/recommended/391730/","owenm28","Mizkitor","http://steamcommunity.com/id/owenm28/","81 products in account","So, I got this game on the app store after seeing it on the top charts the other day, and was not dissapointed. I enjoyed playing it for hours straight on mobile for a day before I realized the next day they had a syncing function and you could sync between PC and mobile. I instantly bought Crashlands on Steam and have been playing a lot between mobile and steam. I love this game and would easily reccomend it.\n\nI like the graphics a lot, the cartoony style is really attractive yet easy to run. They don't dissapoint. My computer, which, at the moment has a hard time running games, gets a steady 60 fps on high shaders.\n\nThe quests are really fun and you have a ball exploring the open world. The humor of the quests and the way characters speak is really nice and something anyone and everyone can appreciate.\n\nThe crafting is very nice, and I love the endless inventory. Only con I can see here is that they ask you to wait a specific time before each item is made. It isn't too bad, usually, but in late game it can take forever, and it feels tedious and annoying. Thats one feature definitely not needed.\n\nCombat is awesome, and doesn't dissapoint. It's very fun to learn opponents patterns and find out tricks and strategies as you go.\n\nThe main storyline is funny, fun to play, and very interesting. I have/had fun playing it.\n\n\n\nOverall, I'd give crashlands a solid 9/10. It's a great game, but there are a few unwanted features and hinderances here and there.\n\nI think this definitely needs to be connected to the workshop, for sure. I'd love to see what content creators and modders would make and I think it would add a lot more fun and spice to the game. It also needs a console or debug command center, for cheaters and testing and just fun overall. I think all games like this NEED to have a console integrated into the game so the time searching for trainers online doesn't need to be spent.\n\nThe time limit on crafting is pointless and should be taken out. It hurts me to say this but its fairly obvious it is just there so that the creators  can have you spend more time in the game. Other than that, it serves no point. At all. Worthless feature which smudges the games reputation and gameplay.\n\nYou should be able to view the items in your bottomless inventory. I can't tell you how many times I wanted an item and didn't realize I'd had it, and wasted forever trying to find/harvest it. Thats what the tracking is supposed to fix, but tracking doesn't track multiple recipes, so when you track one piece of armor and keep the other in your head, but then do not have the ability to see if the items for the recipe in your head are in your inventory, it can get annoying. Especially when your very far from home and don't feel like teleporting.","February 7","true","7.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is a world built for those who love to quest, are OCD or are just looking to hack away at space cow-hippo hybrids. It reminds me of an old-school Gameboy era RPG with elements of Diablo. Although the character progression is a bit linear the crafting and building combined with the simplistic combat makes the mechanics almost buttery smooth.\n\nThere are two major things that make this game addicting for me; the first being the pet system. It's challenging to grow your pets but easy enough to not frustrate you. Secondly, the freaking cross platform play is absolutely wonderful but no where necessary to fully enjoy the game. The fact that I can lay in bed and continue playing is huge and seemless. I couldn't have expected more for the total of $20 I paid for this game and appreciate the vast amount of fun that it has given me.","January 25","true","3.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

That can make combat really cumbersome. I'm sure something like this will be fixed in patches in the future though. It works great for me sitting with my mouse and works slightly less well when im in tablet mode just trying to chill and gather material.\nThe story is well flushed out with lots and lots of variety, and I cannot reccomend this game enough. It's akin to terraria, mixed with diablo.. mixed with... some of your rpg adventure games...\nThe humor is great, and I find myself really getting sucked into the game. At times the music can seem annoying and repetetive even though it is fairly varied. i just eventually found myself listening to pandora... and option to do that through the settings could be useful. Although its not particularly hard as is.\nWell Stop reading the review and get into the game! if you just want to dip in your toes try it on mobile first, and I'm almost certain you will love it on both platforms.","January 25","true","6.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Any of the videos I watched on it, the screenshots, the reviews in the Steam page, all of it left me feeling like I wasn't quite getting the full picture, and it took me days to finally decide that I might as well take the risk and give it a try.  After all, it's $15 and Steam refunds take a lot of the risk out, these days.\n\nI won't be needing that refund.  You wouldn't think that the simplistic, Don't Starve-esque style would work that well outside of Don't Starve, but it does.  You wouldn't think that combat based around touch-screen-style mechanics or one click could be intricate and interesting and skill-based, but it is.  I wouldn't have thought that I would enjoy this game, because I felt so in-between based on the reviews and the information I'd found, but I do.\n\nThe quirky humour, the unique setting, the combat and the gear-based grind coupled with the fact that even if you're undergeared you can still take on the difficult stuff if you have the skill.  Again, I can't help but reiterate that this is a combat mechanic that's skill-based with one-click.\n\nI've only spent a handful of hours (3.5) in this game already, but I can already tell I'm going to be here for a long time yet.  I couldn't figure out what to make of this game when I found it, and I very nearly overlooked it just because it looked so odd at a glance, but I have no regrets at all about giving this one a try, because this is something new, unique, and yet somehow incredibly familiar.","January 26","true","19.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Then Crashlands happened.\nLately I've grown tired of gaming, don't know why. Even Fallout 4 is just laying around and not getting played at all.\nThen Crashlands happened. A game that isn't my most favorite genre and didn't peak my interest until TouchArcade shed some light on the game including the touching backstory (developer with cancer) fueling the entire creation of this very game together with his two fellow brothers.\nThis is also why I decided to not only purchase it for iOS, but also Steam.\n"Yeah ok," you might be wondering "...but is the game any good? Especially when it's not really your genre?" Heck yeah it is!\nThis game is so incredible that I've already played almost 12 hours in total and only just now I've finished the required quest to move on to the second biome in the game.\nIf you love the art, music and humor presented to you in the trailer speaks to you, then please don't hesistate. Buy it!\nPersonally, I just can enjoy spacing out endlessly whacking away at resources and enemies. The game works for any mood you are in, which makes it so accessible. You can play it for minutes, or hours, also a key feature to make a game accessible.\nAnd perhaps the most exciting part is the extra polish and features this game is going to receive over the next few updates to come.

As it is now, the only way to see how many you have is by getting more of those items and watching the loot message. This would also help the few quests where you need to kill x number of mobs, again , very few of this type. One more nice to have, some way to see your inventory, you can see items  you can see consumable, useable type items, but items for craftables, you cannot see, unless you check the loot message.

This game is terrific and worthy of your hard earned money (and then some - I could easily see it doubling in price and still being worth it).\n\nPROS:\n\n+ Keybinds (they're a godsend and quality of life upgrade)\n+ Ability to take in the rich graphical beauty in full view.\n+ Infinite inventory\n+ Instant teleportation across the map to allocated teleport pads you discover as you explore.\n+ Humor (this can be a con or pro depending on the person)\n+ An in-depth crafting system with plenty to collect for hoarders and plenty of options for all types of players.\n+ Cloud sync so you can load your save file on any device if you have it on each and continue where you left off.\n\nCONS:\n\n- Can get tedious and repetitive if you're trying to min max your stats by rerolling gear repeatedly.\n- Movement speed feels slow sometimes and finding that attribute on gear that is also good gear is going to be pretty tough.\n- Not very forgiving for mistakes in dodging enemy attacks (however, you can absolutely play on a lesser difficulty setting when you create the game)\n- Cannot change difficulty of your game on the fly.\n\nCounting the hours I've spent playing on IOS, I'm probably close to 10+ hours in and I've barely scratched the surface of the game, it feels like. I was a little unsure about whether or not I'd like the PC version, but now I can honestly say it is, without a doubt, the BEST version of the game. Moreover, the price justification needed to be there, and it is.\n\nOne of the only flaws I found with the game was on mobile platforms - tapping to move kept my finger in the way of what's going on, making avoiding attacks from enemy creatures more of a pain than it needed to be. At least for me. But that completely goes away here.\n\nThe graphics are wonderful and the way this game has improved upon the concept of Don't Starve is incredible. Absolutely everything was done right. Infinite inventory, the crafting system, pets that you can evolve (with a clever little homage screen to pokemon for their evolution), exploration, teleportation, the list goes on and on. Gone are the days of hiking back to your base by foot, or worrying whether or not you have enough inventory space left or whether you should pick up X item. Gone are the days of hunger and medical stats dragging you down (at least so far in my excursions).\n\nThe price tag is a lot more than on mobile platforms, but the game is absolutely 100% the same. So if you're strapped for cash and okay living without keybinds to open your inventory/quest log/build menu/etc, it's worthy of your time on any platform. But for those just interested in the PC version, who may be on the fence, do yourself a favor and buy it. If you liked Don't Starve, you'll LOVE this just as much, if not more, depending on the person. I myself can easily see many many more hours of this one in my future. You get your money's worth, that's for sure.","March 7","true","48.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I can't fault the game design or UI given its multiplatform nature. The only thing I was dissappointed with when purchasing this on PC was the lack of keyboard intergration, it would have been better to have W,A,S,D used as direction keys with the number pad as various action keys. Instead it relies entirely on the mouse for movement, rendering most keys on the keyboard completely redundant.\n\nIt might just be a preferential thing, I personally like DS for their utilisation of both mouse and keyboard. But this is a great game and I am so happy I've discovered the game producers, as you guys seem like a really cool bunch!

You play as Flux, a purple suit of armor with no thumbs and an infinite inventory that manages itself.  Along with your trusty robot companion, you are plopped onto a foreign world via spaceship crash, and it's your job to survive, re-ascertain contact with the company you work for, and eventually get home (I think, if you have one).  The game is sort of a 2D sidescrollerish game, but the world is completely open, filled with lots of little things for you to loot, kill, and ultimately upgrade your housing, weapons, gear, and crafting stations.  There are literally HUNDREDS of items to harvest and collect and craft.  Combat takes some accurate timing and getting used to, but it's loads of fun.\n\n\nPROS:\n\n-Nice graphics, very nice art style\n-Fun combat\n-TONS of things to collect and craft\n-Infinite, self-managing inventory\n-Tools that equip themselves only when you need them, and disappear when you dont so they're not in the way\n-Lots of content\n-Building stuff, in addition to the aforementioned crafting\n-Lots of different enemmies with varying attacks and variations of the species\n-Pets made from killed enemies that help you in combat with active attacks and passive buffs\n-Great music\n-Addicting\n-Cross platform saving with mobile\n-No permadeath, if you die you can just walk to your gravemarker and pick up the stuff you lost\n-Teleports all over the map for fast travel\n\nCONS:\n\n-I wish it wasn't such a pain to navigate between sections of the world like the Savanna and Bawg and then get back to your original house without making another one.\n-I'm honestly trying so hard to find flaws - but godamn I love this game.\n\n\nTL;DR:\n\nThis game only costs $15, and if I had known how much I would enjoy it, I would have paid $40.  It's amazingly fun, with humorous dialogues, fun gameplay, and very intuitive crafting and item collection/use.  I would HIGHLY recommend this game to anyone, even if you're new to games of this type.  I wasn't a huge fan of Don't Starve, but I love this game.  I wish I could high-five the devs and buy them beer.\n\n\nEasily 9/10.","February 18","true","13.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
