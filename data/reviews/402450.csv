He is allowed to have multiple accounts, inactive characters in every major dungeon, they kill you at the end. Some dungeons take 1 hour to complete, others can take 2-3+. The developer is kinda reluctant on fixing things, his last fix he even said "I knew this wouldn't fix it, but you guys wanted it, so I did it." He either doesn't know how to stop them from using inactive account scouts, or refuses to do so.\n\nI wasted days playing, look at my time, in all that time trying to get stronger, better gear, different strategies...But when it comes down to it, knowing how many enemies are in a dungeon, and when they are at their most vulnerable when the boss spawns... Trumps any preparing you can actually achieve in this game, its like playing rock paper scissors with someone that already knows what your going to throw down before they make their choice.\n\nThe good dungeons are spied on by this guild. Before you can get real true good gear, artifacts, they kill you and steal the boss from you, getting themselves even stronger gear in the process and preventing you from getting stronger, throwing you back further and losing your already meager items. I swear to you, don't waste your time... I kept trying, again and again, the guild I was in..no matter how many people we brought, how many alliances we made... 165+ kills and only 7 deaths in 3-4 months of playing the game... Deaths always increase, but kills? They only increase for each unique player you kill, repeatedly killing the same if you havent killed 10 new ones wont count for your total kills... His real kill count is easily above 500+, and still only 7 deaths in 3 months. For a very good reason: They cheat. They abuse this exploit and nothing can be done to stop them, the dev even just said "Multiclients cannot be prevented. We can't do it."\n\nDon't waste your time. You will feel crushed, horribly annoyed, ♥♥♥♥♥♥, sad, and in the end theres nothing that can be done, not even the dev can stop it. This game is clearly headed south, its inevitable that it will die. The population is only 50-60 on a good day. Please, save yourself the time, I don't want anyone to have to go through this.. its worse than hackers, atleast hackers get banned, but this? Nothing can be done to stop it. Nothing. 3 months time and very few deaths is proof of that, and back then the population was around 80.\n\nPlease upvote this to get it on the top, people need to know. They need to be warned. My warning post was removed, but they cant remove this.

Graphics are arguably better, but fall well short of current standards.  Some item drops don't use a container and can blend in with the terrain.\n\nAlso remeniscent of early UO, the user-interface is very clunky,   However, it offers no hotbars, requiring keeping open multiple windows to access frquently used items and skills, cluttering the screen.  Comparing item stats is unecessarily challenging, as it only shows stats via mouse hover and not the item currently in use.\n\nPerformance seems much smoother than UO ever achieved...at least for solo fighting.  However, I noticed other players glitching at times, raising concerns for PvP combat.\n\nThe one big departure from UO I did not expect was the zoning.  Based on the official descriptions, I was expecting a large open, non-instanced world.  While it isn't instanced, the mostly claustrophobically small zones were a surprise.  Zoning is not seamless and requires finding zone connections that are sometimes very difficult to discern from the terrain.\n\nWith the game missing on some key "foundations," I have to give it a thumbs down at this time.","May 19","false","2.8"," 37 of 52 people (71%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","71","37","52","4","3"

Why? An absolute CATASTROPHIC decision was made at the launch of this game on Steam.\n\nThe server was not wiped/restarted from previous tests and betas. What does this mean? Well, simply put you are already months behind a large player base who are pretty much geared to the max with huge realms/land plots with everything in place.\n\nSo, once I had completed the noobie areas I left on my venture to improve my skills and explore the game, upon leaving the noobie area I was instantly rooted and two shoted by a veteran player. I ran back to my corpse to collect my items and I was instantly killed on the spot. Fair enough, I left the noob area via a different exit, only to be immediately killed again by a two man squad, again I can only imagine geared to the very max. I stood ZERO chance. This process repeated itself for the next 2hours while I tried to leave the noobie zone and improve my skills.\n\nI've given up.","May 20","false","80.5"," 30 of 44 people (68%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","68","30","44","4","8"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/axident21/recommended/402450/","axident21","Axident","http://steamcommunity.com/id/axident21/","273 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nTLDR; Graphics dated but effective 8/10, Sound is solid but repetitive 7/10, UI does its job but has room for improvement 6/10, PVE Gameplay lots to do and work towards 9/10, PVP Gameplay in its current state 6/10 (read third last paragraph for current issues in PVP).\n\nLinkrealms is essentially a re-imagined version of Ultima Online.  Having played UO years ago I was already somewhat familiar with the basic mechanics of this game but I will attempt to give a fair review from both sides of fence (UO Veteran & Never played UO).\n\nThe graphics are simple but vibrant compared to its UO counterpart.  Don't expect next gen diablo styled graphics.  Animations are smooth and generally well done.  Graphics are not a primary selling feature for games of this genre so as long as the graphics do not interfere with gameplay, which they do not, then it's a pretty easy bar to get over.\n\nThe sound is solid all around.  Sound effects have good weight to them, the ambience is nice (having a separate volume slider for ambience would be appreciated though), and music does it's job of setting the general tone but is average and repetitive.  In a game like this that has a lot of grinding involved in it even the best music will get repetitive unfortunately.\n\nThe interface is modern but still retains some of the classic UO charm with its inventory system.  Most things can be moved around to suit your personal preference.  I feel like the interface is still a work in progress and hopefully it will be even more polished in the upcoming months/years.\n\nThe gameplay is what a classic UO player might expect with some reservations however.  Basically you create a character and the skills you're using improve as you use them.  There is a skill cap currently of 700 which means you could max out a total of 7 skills.  One major change to skill caps in Linkrealms is that your crafting skills DO NOT count towards your global 700 points.  If you change your mind it is easy to set a skill to drop and start working on something in its place so you are never really locked into your characters build.  Stats (STR, AGI, WIS, INT) will raise with relevant skill usages and also have a cap of 275 total points & 125 points per single stat so you will need to balance these out as well.\n\nI personally play on the PVE server because I do not like having the hours of work I put into getting a good weapon/armor wasted because someone ganked me.  From the various materials I have looked at (YouTube, Forum Posts) there seems to be some glaring issues with PVP in the game's current state.  Some of the major ones that were mentioned are: 1. Healing items have a short cooldown while fully & instantly heal making all the arrows/mana you just dumped into an enemy completely wasted. 2. There are no really effective methods of crowd control meaning your enemy can simply run away with no fear of dieing.  3.  When both players have maxed combat stats/skills there are way too many misses happening.  4.  Some veteran players preying on new players making it very difficult to get anywhere beyond the training areas.\n\nOverall impressions for me are that this game has a lot of potential and despite the issues others may have with the current state of PVP none of these issues seem to me like they are unrepairable via future patches.  So in my personal opinion I feel that this game has a variety of content for all types of players with even more planned for the future.  However if you are after a true PVP experience on day one then you may want to hold off for the time being until some of these PVP issues have been properly addressed.  If you are a PVE styled player or don't mind/have patience with the current list of PVP related issues then I feel this game is something that could keep you entertained for years to come.\n\nIf you are willing to grow alongside this game and have a bit of patience while they work on correcting some of the issues I feel like this game will be a real treat and stand out as unique title that few others today will be able to compete with.  The future looks very bright for Linkrealms and I for one am excited to be on the journey with them.  Thanks for taking the time to read my review and if it was helpful give it the mark you feel it deserved!","May 20","true","232.1"," 18 of 26 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","18","26","0","0"

Most of my play time was spent in the games tutorial trying to figure out how to play the game. The game has very solid UO roots so any die hard UO veteran will love to get his or her hands on this game.\n\nFrom what I have heard about the game is it has more PvP then PvE, like the drop items on death time of PvP that I usually strickly avoid, but then they came out with a PvE server with some PvP so I decided to play there instead of the full blown PvP server. There are to many other full blown PvP games that this one has to condent with like Albion Onliline, Crowfall, Camelot Unchained, Etc.\n\nI streamed the game for about 5 hours today, there were a about 8 people watching and 1 veteran that answered a few of my questions that I had about the game.","May 19","true","18.6"," 17 of 28 people (61%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","61","17","28","2","0"

It may not yet have as much character development possibilities as Garriot's game, but it sure seems promising as hell. :)\n\nIt can be hard for people that are new to this particular genre, since you usually lose all your assets in your inventory after you die in a PVP zone, but that's just the way of life in games like these. Also, devs seem to care about the community feedbacks and keep fixing things or implementing stuff, like criminal system for some sort of punishment if people's lust for young blood gets too intense.\n\nNewbie tip: if you usually play alone, stash your loot, make armor and weapon backups and play smart if you delve outside the safe zone and you should be fine eventually :D Train tailoring, cooking and as much tradeskills you can to become self-sufficient.\n\nSince I'm a die-hard UO and EVE online fan, I strongly recommend anyone with similar gaming requirements to get this game yesterday. :)\n\n","May 26","true","54.7"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","6","9","0","0"

I wanted to give it a fair shake so I played for 10 hours just to make sure I wasnt missing something an hour or two in.\n\nVery few people are playing it. Typically anywhere from 40-50 people online at a time.\n\nThe Dungeons are ok but not really exciting.\n\nIf you leave the comfort of a safe zone prepare to be Pked by more advanced players who will loot all your gear and hang out around rez zones and kill you over and over.  Frankly it wont be long until only the few Pkers are playing and they will have no one to kill.\n\nThe areas are all instanced unlike UO which is really annoying. The chunks are super small so you are constantly zoning while traveling or entering dungeons etc.  I honestly felt like I was zoning every 30 seconds while traveling.\n\nI tried to like it as I was a huge fan of Ultima online but I just cant recommend it.","June 1","false","11.9"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","5","8","0","0"

Well you know what?  Welcome to the game.  This game isn't here to make you kill 10 rats until you are level 100.  This game puts you in an extremely challenging environment that is kill-or-be-killed.  Of course you won't be able to stand a chance against someone who put hours into this game.\n\nThis game does NOT pretend to be a theme park MMO, nor does it claim to be perfect.\n\nLet me tell you, finding a dungeon by exploring, clearing the boss after having to FIGURE OUT THE DUNGEON on my own, and looting a small piece of helpful gear was one of the most refreshing experiences in my life.  Was there a quest to tell me how to get there?  No.  Was there a mini map that just gave everything away?  No.  I found it.  I made it my own quest.   And it was wonderful to experince that sense of exploration again.\n\nIs the combat sometimes clunky and isometric an old-school way to play?  Yes.  Well you know what?  If you learn how to play, the combat isn't as terrible as you think.\n\nThey are also one of the few Greenlight beta games that won't be wiping 30 times before launch.\n\nCrafting, while still simple, is also exciting.  Open world farming and the ability to create your own plot of land (or "realm") is great.\n\nWhat I do NOT like is the fact that each area is subsectioned off into these realms I spoke of earlier.  The awkward wait to get between areas is kind of weird.  I'm hoping that can change in the future if this game does well enough.  I don't see any problem with one full merge.  This game would earn major points.\n\nLeveling in this game is VERY similar to Ultima Online.  You don't have this omnious "Experience Bar" that grants you an onminous "level".  What does that even mean?  I hate how MMOs have that.\n\nThis game is skill-progression based with no glorified endgame.  You can be exactly the character(s) you want to be.\n\nFull loot is on spot.  There is even a great rival guild in the game that people try to target because of how evil they act in game.\n\nThis game needs to be given credit where credit is due.  They are NOT budging in terms of P2W cash shops and the creators of the game are ACTIVE on the fourms.  Do you realize how HUGE that is?\n\nGames with amazing potential out there sell out to the few who complain.  This game, while small, stays true.\n\nYes there are clunky bugs, but that's what this game needs you for.  Build a community, tell them about the bugs.  I recall a problem being brought up last week and it was resolved in 6 days in a patch.  That's amazing considering this is run by a group of 3 people.\n\nDo I recommend this game?  Well, are you a pushover themepark MMO player who gets offended if everything isn't handed to you on a flying mount?  Then no.  Go grind a quest or something until your useless expansion comes out, making all of your crap worthless.\n\nDo you want to build community, experience the thrill of full-loot PVP and skill based progression, ready to LEARN a game that actually has mystery behind each and every realm?\n\nThen sure.\n\nBut please, don't listen to these people who drop $15 expecting World of Warcraft 2 and getting a decent piece of potential.  They are toxic and are not meant for this game in the first place.\n","May 27","true","17.7"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","8","14","0","3"

The game in It's core is fun and has all the sweet candies  that an old mmo player needs.  ( Full loot pvp, Skill points system, "UO feeling" , no tutorial (just you and the tough world) , Custom Housing System etc...\n\nBut in fact the reality is other, the game has so much holes in it that after 20h I could say that isn\'t worth your time.\n- The font is close to impossible to read\n\n- The item icons are too big the bags too small, sometimes stacking items won't work\n\n-THE GAME DON'T EVEN ALLOW YOU TO REMOVE A CHARACTER. (If you create 2 characters on your account and screw up something when creating a character you'r  fcked or forced to buy a character slot)\n\n- The Character creation page is a fckng box the game don't scalate to your resolution.\n\n- No hotbars or drag icon for the skills just a rusty settings option menu whit a bind key option.\n\n- Not being able to choose your screen resolution  on settings menu\n\n-No ingame chatlog, You just click an option and a windows pop up whit the chat log taking Screen space.\n\n- The game pretty much instanced making the pvp not fun at all.\n\n-The population is pretty low the fact is that close to no old users play the game nowadays they eventualy leave due poor development progress. Yeah the development team is quite low but they doesn't make any "real" progress  whit new stuff like dungeons,skills. They just update whit hotfixes a couple of times a month.\n\n-At least one developer has a player on her friend list on Steam giving her preference attention + support and oh the irony is the same person that exploits their client,multiaccount and gank all the newbies on shight.\nNote: (I've posted on the forums & pmed couple of times 4 days ago  the dev if they could link my steam account and still no answer )\n\n\n- Some skills are completely unbalanced  You must have and skill called spiritualism to be competent on pvp.\n\n- The dungeons +endgame gear are pretty much monopoliced whit goshts = dead people whit multiaccounts whit all their items blessed that sees you and come to kill you whit her character geared whit endgame stuff  + (If you are lucky enought and manage to kill one of them they won't drop anything upon death) + (They have been playing for 2 months- so yeah 2 months of progress ahead of everyone)\nNote: They tried to implement a fix for ghosting but a couple of hours later It was bypassed.\n\n- They stated that they can't stop people  whit multiaccounts.\n\n- Some cash shop items like color change don't even allow you to choose the color you want. Completely random whit no warning on the description.\n\n\n\nSo yeah for all the stuff stated ↑ ↑ ↑ the game isn't worth your time nor your money at least for now, if the devs changes their mindset ( I doubt it, THE GAME IS 5 YEARS OLD yeah they've been working for 5 years on it) maybe a miracle will happend.\n\n\n+++TLDR: Save your time+++\n\n--Regards.--\n--SrBeb0p--\n\n(My English is quite bad sorry for grammar mistakes]","June 1","false","19.6"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

It's a blast for any old school video  game player like myself.\n\nSO i fixed it all by jumping thru a lot of hoops.\nAnti virus had to make expectoins\nhad to run thru directx 8\nSetting thru folder aswell\nEX: C:/ progam files/ steam/ steamapps/ common / linkrealms / settings\n\nI had problems right away with my resolutoin being 4k and had to go down till i found something that worked thru my PC settings.  There is nothing in game to change it. Plus my anti virus did not like it either. I had to ♥♥♥♥ around with my PC and setting more than i have played the game so far. Good thing i only paid 4 bucks for this game and it still might not even be worth it.\n\nI really want this game to work tho because its right up my alley.","June 4","true","18.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Wanna know why?\nThe damn thing wont start.  First my anti virus thinks its a virus. Then It keeps freezing.  uninstalled anti virus temporarily.
