Unlike Euro Truck Simulator 2 and similar, there is no aspect of gameplay at all.\n\nAs such, if you don't really, really want to drive a bus, then I can't reccommend OMSI for you.\n\nOn the other hand, if, like me, buses are your thing, then this is the best - no two ways about it. The driving physics are excellent, the sounds are just superb, every individual switch in the cab works and attention to detail has been layered upon the vehicles you'll drive. The defualt maps are OK, and the default buses are excellent - but this simulator is all about the mods. There are dozens upon dozens of amazing freeware buses and maps out there, and a few excellent officially endorsed payware items (I highly reccomend the O305 and Three Generations bus packs).\n\nIn case none of the maps available meet your taste, the game includes a map editor which allows you absolute freedom to build your own maps, even if the controls take a little getting used to and the editor itself is really well hidden (google how to run it). With a little patience, you can learn to create assets for the game without too much difficulty in Blender and Sketchup, or, in my case, Gmax, via a very circuitous import route.\n\nThere are limitations - the game only really supports right-hand traffic, for instance. There are left-traffic routes and buses available, but there are issues with passengers walking through the bus. You'd also better get used to selling tickets in German.\n\nThere are flaws as well - you need a fast processor to run this game at all (multiple cores don't help), and an SSD, while not absolutely necessary, will significantly boost performance, as the game is constantly loading items as they come within range. Back when it was released, the game was not stable at all. This seems to be fixed for most people now, but you should be aware of it nonetheless. The physics can be jumpy occasionally, and I've had a few weird bugs like the back end of an articulated bus falling off. This kind of thing has been few and far between for me, though the game becomes less stable the more mods you have (clean up the ones you aren't using). Play with the settings until you get something that seems to be stable.\n\nAll in all, if you like buses, this is simply a must-have. Yes, there are bugs, but they're outweighed by the sounds, the driving physics, the wholly interactive dashboards and the endless customization.","November 10, 2014","true","995.7"," 202 of 216 people (94%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","94","202","216","3","0"

Oh well, what I like about Germany? Beer, maybe sausages? No. It's MAN bus manufacturer, and OMSI. It's been almost 3 years since OMSI 1 came out, and a long journey from 2012 announcement has ended. It's finally here, but does it stand up to the name of great simulation like the last one? Is it worth the asking price? Let's find out.\n\nAfter starting the game, pretty simple menu greets you. It has everything including tutorial, options, starting new game. Everything is self explanatory. Options may be confusing for people who aren't really into computers and configurations, but I'd say, set overall settings to PC 2006 or 2011 (options names) and you're good to go. Controls could be confusing too, but driving on keyboard (even is game is designed STRICTLY for steering wheels) is pretty well done, and is fun. I've had no problems setting up two steering wheels in it. After short configuration, I've finally started the game up. After pretty long loading, game had no bus whatsoever. So I've pressed ALT, and then a simple menu came out of nowhere. That little thing is handyas from here you can get new bus from there, fix it, choose timetable or change the Bus display. There is a lot to have fun with. So I've choosen Advertised MAN NG272 and then the fun began. First of all, this game is not for casuals. You need to know what exatly you need to do in order to start the electricity, engine, and then finnaly move your bus. You need a basic knowledge of how buses work in order to find OMSI 2 fun. So after some clicking with mouse on virtual cockpit of my NG272, I've finally heard this bearutifull beast. WOW the sound design is AMAZING. Everything is in place, even creeking of the joint of the Bus. Sound quality is TOP NOTCH. It's better than most games out there.\n\nGraphics however aren't that great. 2D trees crossed to make a 3D like impression, 2D bushes, and blocky buildings with pretty low-res textures and berlinians who walk pretty badly... but who the hell looks at graphics in simulation? Bus Models are top notch. Well detailed, well textured. However the deal breaker could be optimisation. It lacks a bit, but it's certainly better than the first one. After configurations you can get most out of it, that's why everything is so complicated in options menu. I'd recommend setting Texture Max Memory to max of your graphic card. Lags in game could be a little annoying while loading next map tiles, but you'll get used to it. Ai can also be pretty jerky, and pretty tough to cooperate with, but hey, when you get used to it, it doesn't really matter. We all need to give credit to Marcel Kuhnt and Rudeger Hulsmann (yes, those two guys created this game) for even doing such a great job on other aspects of the game.\n\nPhysics are top notch. Every bump has it's feeling. You feel the mass of the bus, and also how well in handles (when of course you know HOW to drive a bus). You will feel significant difference driving on snow, and or dry asphalt. It's incredibly well made. What shines in this game is it's flexibility. You can do everything you want in bus. Open windows, manually open doors, press all buttons on cockpit and see what they do. It's like, literally, you can do EVERYTHING you always dreamed of with a bus, including even manipulating Roll-Band displays.\n\nAnother great thing is it's modability. You can install user created buses, maps, scenery objects, sounds, Ai etc into this game. What's even more awesome, is that OMSI 2 is backwards compatible with all user created content for OMSI 1. Yay!\n\nFor what it is, and for what it provides, yes, OMSI 2 is worth the money. Your childhood dreams of being bus driver finnaly came true, and what's more important, they are on steam, available to everyone. Aswell as Euro Truck Simulator 2, HEED THE MOCKERS. Don't listen to anybody who say that simulation games suck, because you will miss the pinnacle of simulation games on PC. However you look at this game, it's maybe not perfect, but it's excusable, due to low human resources of MR Software. I mean, come on. I've never saw two people creating such good game with such attention to detail. After starting up OMSI 1 and OMSI 2, I felt like they were both passionate about busses. Bus driving seems boring to some people, but believe me - it's a hard job. Those two guys captured the true feeling of that job. Game itself shows how much they loved what they did in this game. It shows how dedicated both Marcel and Rudiger are to simulation and re-creation of real-life feeling of such universal job. Yes, animations are lacking,  graphics too, and optimisation a bit aswell, but we cannot deny the fact, that nothing beats the OMSI 2 in terms of physics, sound and design. Other companies (Including TML Studios) cannot even think of being close to what OMSI 2 did. I won't spoil how many new things are in game. Certainly MAN NG272, thus argiculated bus support is there, which is a very nice touch. There have been improvements, and they certainly add even more depth to already impressive and deep simulation.\n\nIt's a good game, for a good price. Pick it up if you're not affraid of it's downs.\n\n8.5/10\n\n(Original review restored)","December 11, 2013","true","84.0"," 347 of 488 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","347","488","0","11"

Yes, it is difficult to master at first and will take time to figure out. Yes, you have to read the manual and instalation of addons can be a pain.\n\nBut still, there is absolutely NOTHING like it. It is hands down the best transport sim there is - most detailed, most realistic representation of driving a public transport vehicle, period. I own them all - and nothing else comes close.\n\nThe busses (the included ones and most 3rd party addons too) are infinitely detailed, with nearly all functions working and represented. Deep scripting allows for modders and 3rd party developers to represent nearly any of a bus' systems faithfully; and basic scripting it is not difficult to understand, so if you don't like something - you can put the time in and change it. The sounds are superb, best and most detailed of any sim. There is interaction with the passengers, they're not just props. There is an infinite ammount of freeware addons (I don't remember when I last played the default map or one of the default busses), some of which are not only as good as payware addons - many they surpass the payware addons. There are huge maps with 20 different routes and small maps with one or two routes. There are city maps and interurban maps. Busy maps and quiet, pastoral maps. And most of the maps coming out nowdays are detailed and pretty.\n\nOf course, OMSI is also deeply flawed. You have to take that into account, especially if you're used to sims and games built by large companies with teams of developers. It has all the classic limitations of a game built in the living room by two passionate guys - a crappy engine (performance can suffer on large maps even on the best of systems), occasional crashes and errors, underdevelopment in many areas (the AI of cars can be infuriating, they are dumb as hell and never leave their paths, which can create gridlock sometimes). But the core of the simulation is so good that you get used to the flaws and learn to work around them. And yes, it is worth it.\n\nNever had there been a sim on which I've logged so many hours.

This simulator is for people who don't need high frames (you won't get above 60 fps regardless of your specs) or photorealistic graphics, this is for simulator people.\n\nThe base game comes with two maps, one large reconstruction of 1980's Berlin and a smaller, fictional, training map. It includes four different busses, one bendy-bus, one single-decker, and two double-deckers. This isn't a lot of content for upwards of £20, but there is a strong modding community which can add a whole new feel and look to the game, so dont worry about this when you first play.\n\nFor people who like to pick up a game and play it without much of a learning curve, OMSI 2 is not for you. I personally spent at least an hour, configuring settings for my Logitech G25 Racing Wheel, and learning all the different buttons on the bus dashboard. Once you know what to do, this game is alot of fun, but until then, I found it quite frustrating. Look at the forums for Input Configuration for different racing wheels and controllers, someone has already configured them and you can just paste those into the directory.\n\nPerformance, don't expect much. This is one of the cons of this game, it is very badly optimised. I reach anywhere from 20-60 frames, and experience frequent micro-stutters during gameplay, however I purchased this game knowing this would be the case.\n\nActually driving the bus feels fantastic, the physics (force feedback adds lots of realism) and feel of the busses is very well executed. I've never driven a real bus, but I think this could be considered close. The sound engine for this game is phenominal, and is really engaging. This is one of the most polished features.\n\nFor those who really want to drive a realistic feeling bus, while configuring routes and lines on the IBIS stystem, worrying about temperatures, and sticking to a strict schedule, buy this game. The price is quite high, but if you're one of those people, you will definitely get your money's worth.\n\nIf you've played ETS 2, or City Bus Driving, and think "hey I like simulators", be warned, this game is much more complex. You may still enjoy it, however if you're expecting an easy time I wouldn't recommend it.\n\nIn Conclusion:\n\nPros:\n\n> Realistic Physics\n> Realistic Sounds\n> Plenty of mods\n> Feels like you're driving a bus\n> Excellent replayability (different lines/routes and maps)\n\nCons:\n\n> Poor Optimisation\n> Poor Graphics\n> Rather Expensive\n> Complex to configure and learn","September 20, 2015","true","23.4"," 57 of 67 people (85%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","85","57","67","6","0"

It is a game crafted with love and attention to detail, unlike certain other simulators.. *cough* Train Simulator.\n\nSo what's so good about OMSI?\n\n+ The buses are very high quality, and almost every button in the cab works. Every little function in the bus actually works. Even the driver window slides! The bus sounds are top notch, and this game has one of the best sound engines I've ever heard.\n+ The game simulates passengers, and it does it very well. The passengers evaluate your bus driving, and will moan at you if the bus is too cold or too warm or you attempt to short change them. They will want to get off your bus if your driving is not up to scratch!\n+ The game fully simulates a 24 hour clock, and various types of weathers such as rain, snow, fog, etc. You will notice less cars and passengers at night, and lots more at rush hours.\n+ OMSI has a huge modding scene, which means you can download tons of new maps and buses for free. There's always more to do, and you don't have to fork out £24.99 cause you want some different scenery.\n+ Timetables are fully simulated, and AI buses follow them just like you. You can even take over an AI bus if you wish.\n+ The included Berlin map clearly had a lot of detail put into it. Compare it on Street view or compare images and the similarities become obvious right away.\n+ The game is supported with Official DLC's which are of great quality.\n+ The game has full steering wheel support which is really great if you have one.\n\nOkay, so what about the negatives?\n\n- The game WILL micro-freeze and suffer from framerate issues. If you are really really sensitive to issues like this, I would not recommend it. If like me you are willing to look past these issues, you will be fine. It doesn't prevent me from enjoying the game.\n- There are various bugs here and there such as the AI hitting you sometimes, passengers noclipping through bus stop shelters, etc.\n- The graphics are by no means amazing and they could be better, but I do think they do the job.\n- The game can be intimidating at first and the tutorials really are quite useless, don't bother with them.\n- The settings can be hard to configure, and aren't as simple Low, Medium and High. This can also be seen as a good thing as you can customise them best to your system.\n","May 27, 2015","true","187.1"," 45 of 53 people (85%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","85","45","53","6","7"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/theneomaster/recommended/252530/","theneomaster","TFX | Neo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/theneomaster/","368 products in account","OMSI is an excellent bus simulator, but not in the same respect as Euro Truck Simulator 2 - buses are a very niche subject, a lot of people can relate to wanting to be a truck driver, a pilot, or even a train driver. But a bus driver? What?\n\nMost people's first impression of OMSI is that it's just another broken, unfinished simulator that isn't worth your time. You're not exactly wrong. If you're not a bus enthusiast and you think OMSI looks like a piece of ♥♥♥♥, I'm not going to try and convince you otherwise. This game is not for you. Don't buy it. Why are you still reading this?\n\nNow, OMSI mainly caters to those of us who grew up on buses, and developed a liking for how they work and all the sounds that the various parts made. It does that by offering astounding levels of detail and realism in the sounds and models. As a result OMSI is a proper, full-on SIMULATOR. If you picked up ETS2 in a sale, enjoyed it, and thought "hey, these simulators are actually pretty fun, and people are raving about how OMSI is one of those good simulators, I should try it" then I fear that you MAY be sorely disappointed by OMSI.\n\nDon't get me wrong, both OMSI and ETS2 are fantastic simulators but in very different ways. With ETS2 there are simple controls and tutorials to make it easy for people that are new to driving simulators, or just want to finish the objective without a care for how realistic it is - and on the other hand for the enthusiasts there are options to enable things like realistic air brakes, set up a steering wheel and so on.\n\nAs for OMSI, there are a few tutorials and arrows to guide you through the routes but apart from that there is no hand-holding. (almost) everything on the dashboard works, and you have to do everything yourself. I mean, anyone can play it, don't get me wrong. The physics are clearly optimized for a steering wheel controller but it still works very well with the mouse too. It's just that when you go into OMSI you need to understand that it is a simulator for enthusiasts, and have the patience to forgive its little flaws, figure everything out and play it properly.\n\nYes, you COULD take a wrong turn and crash your bus into an invisible wall that launches your bus into space. The solution? Don't do that! If you go into OMSI with the right mindset, and especially if you are a bus enthusiast, I can assure you that you will have a great time. Sure, the graphics for the environment look a bit dated, the pedestrian animations are hilarious and the AI can be a bit weird at times. And, of course, it being a niche simulator on Steam means it will recieve endless hate from idiots who have bought it without doing any research beforehand, and then complain about finding it boring. But you have to remember it was only made by two students, and the level of detail that has gone into the things that really matter is truly incredible.\n\nSome may find the price unreasonable, but the bottom line is anyone who can truly enjoy this simulator will find that it is worth the money to them. Otherwise, wait for a sale.\n\nIn conclusion, OMSI is a fantastic simulator but is more akin to Flight Simulator than Euro Truck Simulator, and as a result is not for everyone.","December 11, 2013","false","90.4"," 195 of 302 people (65%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","65","195","302","2","4"

Yes, they are a bit irritating but the gameplay is so good that I don't care about it. The game has an huge community (mostly german but there are also enough english speakers) with an large database of FREE mods like: new busses, new maps/routes, bus modifications, reskins etc.\nIt's also very easy to mod it by yourself.\n\nDRIVING:\n(Please note: I'm using a steering wheel with force feedback as controller, this adds more driving pleasure to the game. It might be different when using a mouse or keyboard as controller)\nI start off with the most important thing of the game, driving!\nWhen you get in your bus for the first time, it could be a bit overwelding. The amount of buttons and switches are enormous. It isn't an easy to pick up game. If you want the full experience out of the game, you need to invest some time in it to learn how it works (the errors and the AI behaviour is a bit odd so in the beginning this can be quite frustrating but after some time you know how they respond so you can change your way of driving on it), and of course how to drive the damn thing ;-).\n\nIf you get the hang of it you will see that it's quite fun and challenging to drive a bus. You have 12 meters behind you to keep an eye on and a schedule. You also need to take care of your passengers that want to be comfortable and on time at their destination.\n\nPERFORMANCE\nOmsi doesn't run on a fancy big graphic engine. Even the fastest PC can have some lag in this game. Omsi hasn't got a stable frame rate because the scenery is on any place different. But I can give you some predictions of what frame rate you will get:\nLow-end PC: 10-18 FPS\nMid-end PC: 20-40 PFS\nHigh-end PC: 30-60 PFS\n\nI know 18 FPS doesn't sounds much but there isn't really much fast action so it's acceptable and playable.\n\nMODDING\nOmsi is a great game to mod! It has an open folder structure so you basically don't need to install any tools to get going. It takes time to know how to mod but an experienced modder shouldn't have any problems with it.\n\nInstalling mods is as easy as extracting an archive file. And the good news is, they are all free!\nBut when you want to instal a new map for the first time, you will find yourself getting loads of errors due to missing files. For many maps you need to download a whole list of other objects or maps to get going. But once you've installed a couple maps, you don't get many errors any more because most maps use the same objects.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n+ Realistic driving physics and controls\n+ Huge amount of detail\n+ Fun to drive\n+ Large amount of free available mods\n+ Easy to mod\n+ Best (bus) driving simulator\n\n- Crashes sometimes\n- Some bugs\n- not easy to pick up (you need to invest some time to learn how the game works)\n- Not suited for everyone\n\nI would definitely recommend this game if you like simulators. It's one of the best driving sims out there (yes, it beats Euro Truck Simulator 2 on the driving experience). If you can ignore the bugs and you are open to spend some time on learning the game and read some tutorials that you would have hours of fun with this game!\n\nGreetings from the Netherlands =D","June 19, 2014","true","402.2"," 42 of 53 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","42","53","0","3"

On one hand, this is the best and most accurate bus simulator available on the market. Almost every aspect of the buses are modeled to the last detail and are functional.\nOn the other hand, this game, our only choice on the market, is an unstable and poorly optimized offering. Do tweak the memory settings and and use the 4 GB patch to alleviate some of the crashes. I rarely experience them after doing so.\nYou should also be prepared to read the manual a lot and/or watching videos on YouTube to figure everything out, as the in-game tutorial does little to teach you the ropes.\n\nThe base game doesn't have a lot in terms of content, but the official DLC bring a lot of variation and there are lots and lots of community created maps and vehicles available online for free.\nThe price is fine considering the depth of the simulation, but I would have expected a more polished product by now. If you get all the DLC it'll get quite costly, especially considering the game almost never appears on sales.\n\nGet this only if you're sure you like deep vehicle simulations, but prepare for some frustration due to instability.\n\nI rate this game:\nEssential\nRecommended\nConditionally recommended\nNot recommended\nAvoid","February 18","true","119.8"," 21 of 25 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","21","25","0","4"

I had faith that M-R would be able to fix it, and they have. New releases from small developers frequently have problems which take some time to fix.\n\nSince the last few updates, I've had no crashes, hangs or freezes. It works fine.\n\nOMSI is a reputable bus simulator whose main focus is on the core simulation. The main focus of attention is where you want it - in the bus. The outside world looks dated, but the buses themselves are beautifully recreated, and their operation is perfect. The sound system is the best I've heard in a game - sounds are generated dynamically, rather than soundfile x being played when condition a is met.\n\nHardcore simmers will appreciate how few 'gaming' elements are here - no cheaty UI, no dialogs, nothing. You have to actually learn how to drive and operate a bus rather than just jamming W and hitting checkpoints. Keyboard or mouse control is acceptable, but OMSI allows gamepad, joystick and steering wheel input (the latter is highly recommended). It also supports TrackIR, which is amazingly immersive.\n\nIf you are not a hardcore simmer, or take an interest in buses, then maybe TML's series is for you. OMSI has a steep learning curve and is more about the simulation of operating a bus realistically than beautiful rendered cities.\n\nAs you can see, I've plenty of hours logged in OMSI. A lot of these come from the Map Editor, which although unwelcoming, is very powerful and lets you create some engaging and entertaining routes to drive.\n\nOverall, I'd rate this 9/10. It lacks a modern graphics engine (and the tiling system is dated and clunky), but this is a simulator, not a game. If M-R could borrow SCS's graphics engine, they'd have the perfect simulator.","July 20, 2014","true","984.2"," 20 of 25 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","20","25","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thebigbadonion/recommended/252530/","thebigbadonion","Onion","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thebigbadonion/","342 products in account","There’s something oddly wonderful about a game trying to recreate niche, and bizarre parts of history. None more than OMSI, a game which sets out to lovingly recreate buses/routes in Berlin. Not just Berlin, but more specifically the Spandau district from 1980’s – 1990’s, a very peculiar, and to most of us obscure part of history. But does it succeed?\nLet’s make one thing clear, this is not ETS2. It’s not lavished with game style game play mechanics about levelling up your character, running your company, and customizing your vehicles. Nor is it all that user friendly, or really all that approachable. This is a hardcore simulation, with hardcore simulation style lack of game play. The premise is as simple as coul  be, choose a bus. Choose a route. Drive..\n\nGameplay\nThe buses are very nicely recreated, with a full array of working features on the dashboard, from the usual wipers, lights, adjustable suspension (on the more modern buses) and fully functioning computers, and ticket machines. Although unless you speak German, good luck getting your head around those. Thankfully, you can set your bus up using the rather basic, but functional in game UI.\n\nThe game does have a rather steep learning curve, while it does have tutorials these are next to useless, so your pretty much on your own. Getting in to a position where you can pick up your first passengers, is rather more than just selecting a job, and pressing E to start your engine, and putting the bus in to gear and driving. Every button on the dashboard does something some of these things are more useful than others.\n\nIf your patience lasts long enough to get your head around the rather steep learning curve, you’ll quickly find the game is actually quite enjoyable in a mundane, driving a city bus kind of way. Driving your assigned route, you’ll of course be stopping at bus stops, picking up rather badly animated but very amusing robotic passengers, selling them tickets, and all the usual things expected from a bus driver. The simulation of this goes quite deep, even down to them complaining, if the bus is cold.\n\nThe actual driving of the bus feels very nice, and really the developers have managed to create the feeling of driving a very large, cumbersome heavy vehicle, turns will be taken slowly, and much care has to be taken when weaving in and out of parked cars, and other obstacles scattered around the lovingly created depiction of Berlin. Upon hitting something, the passengers, which by now you have become belligerent towards, will swear, and shout at you in German demanding to get off.\n\nSound:\nThe sound is absolutely spectacular, and a real master class in how the sound should be in these types of games, it’s incredibly atmospheric, and really transported me back to the 80s/90s as a kid travelling to school on those old double decker buses. From the whine of knackered old diesel engine, to the wind blowing in to the slightly open window, the bus rattling and banging as it chugs down the road. Its absolutely superb, and other developers of simulators should certainly take note.\n\nPhysics:\nAs said already, the basic driving physics are excellent, however the other world physics, are more hilarious than anything else. With vehicles catapulting about in an accident, or humping the ground, people being swallowed by the floor. It all makes for some highly amusing, if immersion breaking moments.\n\nControl devices:\nIt’s a given that a game like this is best played with a wheel, rather than state the obvious, I think its best to discuss other control devices, not everyone owns a wheel.\n\nController:\nThe mainstay of driving games, for those without a wheel at least. Unfortunately, using a controller is next to impossible. The over sensitivity of the Xbox 360 controller is not accounted for at all, no dead zones are added or able to be added. The stick simply functions as a wheel, which makes controlling the bus immensely sensitive, and next to impossible. Don’t even bother.\n\nKeyboard:\nWhile the keyboard is completely indispensable, with the massive array of functions, and systems, all of which you will need to control, driving with it is, really as to be expected. The game uses the numpad by default. 4 Turns left, 6 turns right, and 5 centres the steering. While its more than possible to drive using the keyboard, keyboards don’t feature any analogue devices, everything of course is either on or off, which can make for some pretty heavy accelerating and braking, which is usually met by lots of angry German swearing from the passengers.\n\nMouse:\nThis is my preferred method for controlling the game. Generally I hate mouse driving, its over sensitive, has very little feedback, or makes very little sense. But the developers of Omsi have definitely cracked it. Move the mouse up to accelerate, down to brake, and of course left and right steer. If you don’t have a wheel this is my recommended method of controlling it. The only drawback, is steering, and accelerating at the same time can be rather difficult, and tends to be a little haphazard.\n\nThe bad:\nWhile I would like to say “The game is a triumph buy it immediately!”. That really isn’t the case. OMSI 2 is as awful as it is brilliant, an incredibly mixed bag. As already said, its not very approachable, a lot of the options, the controls list, and other things are not put together in a very user friendly or coherent way, at times it feels like it was designed by a madman! Even when trying to work out /change the controls The list seems to almost be randomly thrown together, without much regard for the poor player who has to find his/her way through it. In a game like this, which has an awful lot of controls, this really does make for frustration, and swearing.\n\nIn general the game is incredibly unpolished, mostly using simple OS ui windows to control various functions. More often than not, these windows can make little to no sense at first glance, and can take a quite some time to get used to.\n\nStability:\nThe games stability is atrocious, and really, unacceptable. The game quits to desktop on a regular basis, randomly fails to load, and throws up a lot of errors usually in German, leaving you with little idea as to what actually happened. Sounds will just stop working, and all manner strange things will happen. For a game that’s been out a year (longer if you count the original) these really are issues that should no longer be present.\n\nNavigation:\nThis is done by a simple overlay with arrows pointing you in the direction and icons over the stops you need to stop at. While this sounds just basic but functional, at times, it can be incredibly confusing. You’ll get arrows pointing you off towards other routes, which have nothing to do with yours, at times it offers you absolutely no direction at all, and other times it just sends you off down side streets your not supposed to go down, or tries to send you down 1 way roads (of course the wrong way)\n\nContent:\nThe base lacks a serious amount of content The map really isn’t that big, and you have a very small number of routes to drive. Simply put, I doubt it will have much lasting appeal.\n\nFinal thoughts:\n\nThis game is actually quite annoying. It’s very solid, and very well made in parts but has far too many glaring issues. While I did enjoy it, It’s certainly not something I can whole heartedly recommend. I actually find it quite annoying, the potential is vast. Should it be given ETS 2’s spit, polish, and level of content, I can’t help but feel it would actually be a superior game, capable of knocking ETS 2 off my favourite simulator spot. But in its current state, its incredibly rough around the edges, and falls very short. If you enjoy simulators, and are looking for something new, you might like this one. But don’t go in to it expecting a complete or approachable, product, it isn’t.","January 16, 2015","false","51.4"," 52 of 83 people (63%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","63","52","83","4","2"

So I think it’s about time I done a review.\n\nThere are many games out there that wrongly claim to be a simulator, not this one. Without a doubt this is the most realistic bus simulator available. It’s definitely not game that you just can pick up and play and you won’t get very far without at least taking a look at the manual.\n\nThe standard game comes with two maps, a small fictional map and Spandau in Berlin set in the years 1986 to 1994 with a selection of MAN buses from that era. As well as the official payware content there is tons of map and bus mods available adding greatly to the experience. My personal favorite mods are the Bowdenham and Szczecin Maps\n\nFirst off the good points. The game is extremely realistic the buses handle accurately and every switch and lever is clickable. You can control almost every aspect in operating the bus including ticket sales, destination displays, doors, lights, heating and so on. In the Berlin map, there is a chrono feature where the route and varies and ticket prices change depending on the time period selected. There is selectable weather conditions that can affect how the bus handles.\n\nToo often, games are often let down by poor sounds but not in OMSI 2 where they are truly excellent, the buses sound just like the real thing. Almost every sound is recreated such as the suspension rattling on bumpy roads, the whine of the transmission and even dashboard button sounds.\n\nNow to the bad points. The graphics aren’t particularly great by modern standards and the game is poorly optimized. It will take quite a bit of time tinkering around with the settings to get respectable framerates. The AI traffic is dreadful often crashing into you but thankfully AI collisions can be turned off. More casual players may find themselves a little overwhelmed by the lack of ingame help. Some may also find the price a bit steep and it’s never included in the Steam sales.\n\nDespite these issues, it’s definitely not a bad effort considering it was made by just two guys from Germany and not some big developer with a massive budget. In a way this game is kind of like an old Italian sports car in that much of the time it won’t run properly and will completely infuriate you but the times when it does work, it’s just brilliant and sounds epic.\n\nSo to sum up, OMSI 2 may frustrate at first but give it a chance and it can become very enjoyable. You may even learn a little bit of German in the process. If you like very detailed simulators and have an interest in buses I would definitely recommend it.","April 19","true","51.2"," 18 of 22 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","18","22","0","0"

It is a good improvement on OMSI 1.\n\nMAPS/VEHICLES: The Spandau map is much extended with a new chronology function where you can see the routes/fares and most importantly the Berlin reunification/fall of the Berlin wall between 1986 and 1994.  Two maps are included the fictional test map Grundorf (one route, the 76) and Berlin Spandau (routes 92 (137), 5 (130) and also two night routes.  Two new buses come with this game the articulated (bendy) bus MAN NG272 (GN92) and the MAN NL202 (EN92).  The two double deckers from OMSI 1 are improved and the MAN SD202 has two new variants; the D90 and the D91.  There are new AI cars including ambulances with working sirens.  There is also much more trains in OMSI 2.\n\nPERFORMANCE: As with OMSI 1, you will need a pretty good PC to run OMSI 2.  FPS is improved from OMSI 1 but lag can be experienced frequently in busy areas of maps.\nI have an Intel Core i3, 6GB RAM and 2GB graphics card.  Here is my FPS on the Hamburg addon map.\nSuburb areas: 30 - 60 FPS.\nInner City areas: 20 - 25 FPS.\nCity Centre areas: 12 - 20 FPS.\n\nUI: The user interface is completely changed from OMSI 1.  The new UI looks much smoother and is easier to use.\n\nBUGS: When this game was first released it was almost unplayable.  It had clearly been released too early, as there were very frequent bugs and crashes.  At this stage (version 2.1, the game is a lot better and crashes are rare.  I have played the Hamburg and Vienna maps for the past few days with no crashes.  Unfortunately crashes do occasionally still occur and there are still some minor bugs, although these do not normally affect gameplay experience.\n\nADDONS/COMPATIBILITY: Many freeware and payware addons exist for OMSI 2.  The OMSI 1 addons Vienna LU 200, Citybus O305 and Hamburg Day & Night have all been patched for OMSI 2.  Most OMSI 1 buses work in OMSI 2, but the majority of maps will not work in OMSI 2 without adjustments.  Many map creators have released new versions of their maps for OMSI 2.  A huge range of mods, repaints, vehicles and maps are available on the OMSI forum and other OMSI related websites.\n\nDRIVING EXPERIENCE/FUNCTIONS: OMSI unlike most (if not all) other bus sims recreates the bus functions and driving physics as close as possible.  Over 90% of buttons are pressable and have a function.  For example you can set the destination using the IBIS computer, spray the windscreen, adjust the heating (involves many switches, not just one button!), lights and door controls.  The bus sounds are excellent.  All have been recorded off the real-life buses.  Particularly with the bendy bus, you can feel the weight of the bus you are driving.  This is enhanced with a steering wheel.\n\nGAME CONTROLLERS: Buses can be controlled with the mouse or keyboard, but for a much more realistic experience a steering wheel is the best.  The best realism can be achieved in OMSI 2 with a 900 degree, force feedback steering wheel.  The one often preferred is the Logitech G27, but as this is very expensive other good wheels include the Logitech Driving Force GT.  TrackIR 6 can be used with this game for added realism of the camera views.\n\nTUTORIALS/DOCUMENTATION: As well as a detailed manual, new to OMSI 2 are tutorials.  I strongly recommend users who have not played OMSI 1 previously to do these tutorials as learning how to operate the buses can be tricky at first.\n\nOverall this is an excellent bus simulator (now that most bugs are gone anyway).  Remember if you purchased OMSI 1 you can get OMSI 2 at a discounted price at the publisher's website.","May 30, 2014","true","501.2"," 21 of 29 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","21","29","0","10"

Definitely it is a game for me too, but there seems to be some issues/bugs.\n\nAfter reducing threads (or what ever was that option called that the game itself proposed after the first crash) helped a lot to the crashing. It still has some random crashes but not too often. Sometimes you manage to lose open window somehow behind the game so that you cannot access it anymore and there seems to be no way to get the window on front again. Sometimes the game doesn't seem to recognize when you arrive to the last stop and then I have to drive a little loop to arrive the stop again. And the line destination setting doesn't work if you write the destination with all minor letters even it looks like that the destination is found from the drop down many correctly, cure for this is to open the line setting window again and press okay (since this time the game has set the minor/major cases correctly), if you fail to notice that you might lose passengers since they don't recognize the arriving bus to be their one.\n\nStill, after knowing these bugs you can get decent "game" play and at least I enjoyed it a lot.

Now having an Intel i7 4790k, a NVidia GTX 970, 16 GB of RAM and a fast SSD where the game is installed to. Guess what I still can't use shadows on any bigger maps and when I activate some weather effects like snow this also brings them down to below 20FPS making the game more or less unplayable. And that even though the system resources are only utilized to around 35%, clearly showing that the engine is the limiting factor. A clear sign for bad programming. Have a look at the following picture, it was taken on the Berlin map at Rathausplatz with shadows activated performing at 17FPS, a no go for a driving sim. http://a4g.eu/images/OMSI_Bad_Performance.JPG\n\n\nOriginal Review May 2014:\n================================\nEigentlich würde ich den OMSI gerne empfehlen aber leider kann man dass nicht grundsätzlich. Nur wer einen leistungsfähigen PC, mindestens bestückt mit einem Intel i5 Prozessor hat und das Spiel auf einer schnellen SSD installiert, kann den OMSI in vollem Umfang genießen.\n\nIch spiele auf einem PC mit AMD FX6300 und einer GTX560 Grafikkarte und habe das Spiel auf einer Intel Serie 520 SSD installiert und kann z.B. die Schatten im Spiel grundsätzlich nicht aktivieren, da die Performance dann in den Großstädten auch mal deutlich unter 20 FPS sinkt, was für einen Fahrsimulator dann doch zu wenig ist. Unabhängig davon kommt es beim Nachladen von Ressourcen, was regelmäßig alle paar Sekunden passiert, trotz der SSD zu heftigen Rucklern im Spiel. Die Grafikkarte wird hingegen nicht wirklich beansprucht. Es macht für die Performance keinen großen Unterschied ob ich z.B. Antialiasing deaktiviert habe oder ob ich 2fach oder sogar 4fach AA aktiviere, der Unterschied in der erzielten Bildwiederholrate im Spiel ist gering.\nAndere Spieler die einen ähnlichen PC mindestens jedoch mit einem Intel i5 Prozessor haben, berichten sie können die Schatten aktivieren und erreichen dann z.B. in Berlin am Rathaus immer noch Bildwiederholraten von über 20 FPS.\n\nWer also einen modernen Intel PC (minimum i5) und eine Highend SSD besitzt und zumindest eine halbwegs aktuelle Grafikkarte sein eigen nennt, dem ist der OMSI zu empfehlen, alle anderen sollten sich bewußt sein, dass sie z.B. auf Schattendarstellung wahrscheinlich verzichten werden müssen.","May 5, 2014","false","50.3"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","0"

Yes, extremely bad pun, but here we go.\n\nOMSI 2 features three extra starter buses than the first edition, with two new starter types; single decker and articulated. Rumour has it, you can also drive trains, which is also an advancement from the previous. It's great to see such new buses on the game. The addition of the articulated bus means that other articulated buses will be coming soon as DLC packs, as they have done previously with OMSI.\n\nNew damage features are also a cute addition. I managed to total my MAN NG272's (articulated) electrics after trying to hug a bus pole (see video above). Passengers have also been fixed so that they don't randomly decide to walk through your bus, while on the road there's new traffic types and features, and random date-specific roadworks.\n\nThere are downsides to this game. There are still a few errors here and there, but few and far between compared to the original. The menu is hard to get used to, but once you do the ride is worth while. Negative for myself; if you're planning to record this game, it's hell trying to record these menus. Those things are like undercover agents.\n\nWhether you are a hardcore game player or a simulator enthusiast, this will be both enjoyable for the realist and hilarious for the hardcore players. It is a truley beautiful game and a pinnacle point in modern gaming, with realism exceeding that found in the Train Simulator/Railworks series.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Deimenried/recommended/252530/","Deimenried","Deimenried","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Deimenried/","240 products in account","In Summary\nOMSI 2 is quirky and has its issues. It makes no secret about that, and honestly that's what makes it endearing. It's a product of that most wonderful human emotion; Nostalgia. With some simple fixes and additions it could be an amazing game, but as it is OMSI 2 is a worthwhile investment. You won't get this level of detail anywhere else and I see no reason why people shouldn't at least give it the benefit of the doubt, especially since the community is so dedicated to producing quality content to expand your gameplay.\n\nExpect:High levels of realism, lots of buttons and switches, to consult the manual to figure out said buttons and switches, passengers, german stuff, lateness, complaints about your driving, tons of addons (both official and third party), creepy kids.\n\nDo NOT Expect:A blockbuster thriller, Speed (movie or rate of movement), triple-A graphics, good AI, an easy time using keyboard, huge variety of anything without add-ons.\n\nLONG VERSION:\n\nOMSI is one of those games that is hard to describe to your friends. "So what do you actually do?" they ask, contorting their faces with confusion. The only answer that I can possibly suggest you give is the truth, plain and simple. "Drive buses." Because there is no one simple explanation which accurately conveys the catharsis of taking some virtual German people around Berlin while they do their day-to-day stuff (which for them means getting on other busses). It seems strange to be sat here recommending this. Even as a fan of truck and train simulators.\n\nFrom the outset OMSI can appear daunting. Even setting yourself up for a simple route can seem very complex at first glance when you are plonked into a very faithfully recreated 1980's MAN bus with a vast array of buttons and switches set out before you. I myself, refusing to give in to the apparently unmasculine urge to consult the relevant instructions, set about spending a good hour just flicking switches and turning things until, to my fervored surprise, the engine rattled to life.\n\nSuccess!" I thought, this being the most progress I had made since I had first booted the game. It was a laughably simple step in the grand scheme of things, but represented the most progress I had ever made. After a few bumps and scratches as I lurched around attempting to wrest control of this double-decker behemoth, I decided that it was time for me to unleash my new-found driving prowess upon the unsuspecting folk of this quaint German village. And that's when I hit the next obstacle. Simply shouting "Get on the damn bus!!!" and honking the horn incessantly as the passengers stood, all gazing in the same direction with their arms half-out as if trying to take flight, didn't seem to do the trick. Nor did it help that when they did move, it was straight past me to the bus now parked behind. It occured to me I might need help. So off to the game manual I went, and after some practice runs I was doing the rounds on the historic Berlin-Spandau lines.\n\nLong story short, you will need to either consult the manual or any of the many kindly YouTube folk who offer tutorials on setting up your bus and carrying out timetables. It is complicated, but it all makes sense in the end.\n\nThe base game comes with a number of routes around the Berlin-Spandau area, mostly during the 1980's. Seems very esoteric, but the developers rode the busses in this era frequently and recall it fondly. For me, that kind of passion is always going to create a game that will make me feel something, even if it doesn't have a story, it still speaks to me in a way that no cookie-cutter FPS can. On the face of it, the graphics engine is shocking, but the scale and detail in parts is beyond impressive. I've never even visited Berlin, but the recreation impressed me and the busses simply look fantastic... or as fantastic as you can make a bus look. Even the simple things like the wear-and-tear on the pedals and buttons that give the bus that lived-in feeling - makes them look like they are used day in and day out and not like they've just rolled off the production line. This is where I feel that other sims like Train Simulator and Euro Truck Simulator are lacking - the vehicles permanantly look new, they don't look like they've seen the years of service they are meant to. By your 20th job on ETS2, your seats really ought to be stained and peppered with sausage roll pastry flakes.\n\nButton BashingAs I have mentioned before, nearly everything in the bus is usable. Nearly all the dashboard switches, even if they have no in-game use, toggle and even have visible effects (such as the bus suspension lowering for disabled passengers and prams, even though there aren't any.) Even the ticket selling is there, the little paddles on the coin racks dispensing the respective amounts into the change rack, giving a little challenge. On top of staying on-time, you must give the correct tickets and change so the passenger can sit down and you can move on.\n\nSeat FillersUnfortunately the immersion is ruined quite quickly. The passengers are one of the two biggest let downs in this game (the second being the AI, which I will mention shortly). Unlike train simulators, you actually see the passengers get on your bus, even ask to buy tickets, but their animations are quite shocking, and their still poses even more so. Passengers stood at bus stops have their arms out from their sides and sitting passengers look like they are holding a beach ball between their hands. Passengers can often get in each other's way if they decide after they've walked halfway down the bus that they want to buy a ticket and queue-cut. Add to that the 5 or 6 variants, and you'll soon be sick of the sight of them.\n\nArtificial UnintelligenceNow, onto the AI. Any game that deals with driving needs to pay special attention. Simply populating the streets with cars is not enough by itself. The traffic needs to display awareness, not only of the rules of the road, but also awareness of other road users. OMSI traffic has neither. I will only say this once; Do NOT turn on traffic collisions. You will regret it immediately as the traffic is clueless. Unless your bus is directly obstructing them they will carry on regardless of if you are indicating or merging or just using a roundabout when YOU have right of way. Nearly all accidents will be their fault and you will be the one penalised. Yes, you get penalties. You have to notify the police and that will lose you valuable time making you irrevicably late for the rest of the day.\n\nIn ControlThe controls for OMSI are a mixed bag at best. Playing keyboard only has been my MO since I learned how to play, and frankly I can live without precision steering. You can use the mouse to steer, but the constant toggling between using the mouse to steer and to use the dashboard is tiresome. I have been led to believe that a wheel is the best way to drive OMSI, but I neither have the time nor money for that kind of set-up.\n\nNot all doom and gloomIf you can see past all the quirks and niggles you will be rewarded with an enjoyable experience. The true value of OMSI lies in the third party content. There are a host of new maps, busses and other mods to expand your driving experience and add hundreds of hours worth of play time.\n\nIf your wallet will forgive you, there are many official add-ons too, but don't expect any of it to be discounted. OMSI 2 is never involved in Steam sales and it will never drop in price.

Of course this is exactly what it says on the tin! It is a bus simulator, so you are not going to get GTA style driving or crashing into vehicles on here like you would in the GTA games. This is for serious driving a bus only and quite rightly so. But I can certainly say that if you want the enjoyment of what it is like to drive a bus. I say get this game because there is a growing amount of add-on's available for this game in both payware and freeware DLC content forms. OMSI2 comes with two bus map routes which the first is Grundorf that is a small town/village and its ideal to practice learning the controls and most importantly the handling of the buses that are included in the game. The second city is the Berlin-Spandau map which has some freeways that you can thrash you favourite bus along if you want to have a bit of fun and there is a good amount of bus services that you can play as too.\n\nMy only gripe about OMSI2 is that sometimes (maybe its a bug in the game) the buses can bounce violently at random times which can be annoying when doing one of the bus services on the map. The keyboard controls are a bit cumbersome at first. But the main thing to have when playing this game is patience and just have lots of practice when driving the bus until you become familiar with the controls. I would recommend purchasing a steering wheel and pedals for OMSI2 as it will make the experience much better. I do hope to see some payware UK bus maps become available in the future and also I would like to see a high quality payware pack of the Dennis Trident/Volvo B7TL Alexander ALX400 buses in all lengths and variants become available to buy as well as I would certainly purchase this add-on.\n\nOverall Rating: 82%.","August 21, 2015","true","137.9"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

For absolute bus sim maniacs its has also schedeuled ai buses feature, which are driving with player on map, by default. Unlike in other bus games, where AI buses spawn shortly before player sees them with random linenumber and bus number, in omsi they are fully simulated, player can switch how many AI buses he wants on map. AI buses take passengers, just like player's bus. Whenever he likes, player can jump to bus controlled by AI, and take control, leaving his own bus to AI.\n\nRoutes are long, some of them demanding, tight schedeules etc. Lots of fun.\nDay-night/weather effects also are implemented. Want to drive night bus, rainy/snowy day ? Did you know that wet / snowy streets change how ie. braking system works ? On a frosty day not setting properly air conditionig will cause passengers start to complain thet its to cold in the bus.\n\nGraphics may not look so awesome like in newest FPS games, but this one has unique setting and feel, and is highly detailed.\n\nGame has lots of player created maps and buses (search for them on omnibussimulator.de)  available for free, but also great paid addons, which add buses to whole game, and maps with loads of schedeules to follow.\n\nSo, if You're bus sim fan - its recommnended, lots of fun awaits You,\notherwise consider this as good but somehow specific game.","May 6, 2015","true","130.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/The_Imaginative_Lad/recommended/252530/","The_Imaginative_Lad","The Imaginative Lad","http://steamcommunity.com/id/The_Imaginative_Lad/","52 products in account","Well what can I say?\n\nThis is a Bus simulator, specifically a simulation of busses in 1980's Berlin. You get one brand of bus with this game but within this brand there are different models of bus. For example, the MAN NL_NG EN92. This is a single decker bus designed specially for city routes due to a top speed of just over 70KM/h, trust me though it can be challenging to get to this speed when onroute and following a schedule. Unlike OMSI 1, OMSI 2 supports articulated vehicles (Bendy Busses). There is one bendy bus included in this game which is called the MAN NL_NG GN92. This bus has a top speed of around 80KM/h which again you will struggle to get to this speed when onroute and following a schedule. There are also two major different types of double deckers, the SD200 and the SD202. As you can guess the SD200 is older than the SD202. There are different variations of the SD200 which start from the SD77 and go all the way to the SD89. Each model showing similarities and differences to each other. There are also different versions of the SD202 ranging from the D82 to the D92 (I believe so although I cannot remember). Again each model showing similarites and differences. The SD200 has a top speed of around 75KM/h while the SD202 has a top speed of around 70KM/h\n\nAnother good aspect of this game is that unlike other games that claim to simulators this game is all about being a simulator. The developers have really focused on the simulation of busses and so you cannot get any closer to driving a bus than to actually drive a bus.\n\nAlthough this has caused some drawbacks the developers have had to cut back on a few things. The graphics are not the best, but at the same they are not the worst. FPS is solely dependant on the power of your PC as unlike some games will see a massive difference between, for example, an Intel I5 and an Intel I7. This game will stutter no matter how powerful your PC is but the stutter will become less noticable on higher performance PCs and will become almost non existant on an SSD (Solid State Drive) and not a HDD (Hard Drive Disk). This will also mean spending a good 10 minutes fine tuning the settings to what your PC can handle.\n\nHowever, despite the graphics and stuttering the sounds are amazing. This is were the developers have obviously spent a hell of a lot of time as all the sounds are almost exact to the sounds in real life. Even the addons have been completed to the same quality of the base game. (Not tested the Chicago DLC, Vienna and Hamburg but have tested the o305 and Three Gen addons).\n\nSo to cut to the chase:\nPros:\nSimulation.\nSounds.\nDetails in the bus models.\nDecent route lengths.\nModding communities.\nFully compatible with modding (New maps, busses, repaints and objects for creating your own maps).\nEditor included in the base game.\nIf you crash the bus too much passengers will want to get off and components of the bus will stop working or fail.\nNearly every button inside the bus can be clicked on, even to the point that wiper speed can be adjusts, heaters, fans, windows and even the steering wheel can be removed. Some busses (mods) can even have outside panels opened like the engine hood or luggage storage on coaches.Cons\nLag and Stuttering (less evident on powerful PCs).\nIf mods have missing components it can be annoying and time consuming to search for the missing components.\nSome dialog from passengers is repeated.\n[*[AI traffic can do some very werid stuff (E.g. stop randomly on a motorway to change lanes).\n[*]The game will sometimes randomly crash\n[*]No visible damage to bus.\n[/list]\nOverall this game is the most played game in my entire steam library.\n\nDO NOT compare this game to other simulators like Euro Truck Simulator 2 as this game has had more money inputted than this game and was designed to have better graphics than this game with simulation as a second priorty, whereas OMSI simulation was a first priorty. It is also important to remember that OMSI was originally created by only 2 people, Marcel and Rudger. This may have changed.\n\nThe game runs between 20-50fps with my specs and with a few tweeks to the PC of 2012 settings:\n\nAMD A6 3500X3 : 2.6GHz OC (2.1GHz stock)\nAMD R9 270X\n8GB 1866MHz (4GB+4GB)\n2TB 7200RPM HDD\n120GB SSD (OMSI 2 is installed on this)\n1920X1080\n\nI am using a Logitech GT Driving Force, this is a 900 degree Force Feedback wheel. In my opinion if not using a steering wheel do not use any other type of controller other than keyboard or mouse. When using keyboard and mouse I recommend you use the mouse for acclerating, braking and turning as the developers have got one of the best mouse control system I have ever seen.","June 23, 2015","true","665.0"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","63","5","8","3","0"

I was curious about how things were in Europe and decided to try it out. After a lot of time and patience spent learning the ropes I decided it wasn't really worth the effort.\n\nThe sim is somewhat unstable and needs a very powerful system to run it. My cheap 1 Gb AMD R7 360 graphics card gives borderline performance, but at least I can run most of the sim and DLC with it. For some reason Chicago Downtown is not playable on my system with frequent crashes after single figure framerates in the many traffic jams that are encountered.\n\nThe bus models are excellent, as are the engine sounds, although the passengers are decidedly terrible. The AI traffic is passable, although perhaps a bit too predictable. Real life bus driving is not an exact science, as the sim seems to want to portray.\n\nWhat the sim does:- Tries hard to make the user believe he /she is driving a bus in service, dealing with customers and busy city traffic.\n\nWhat it doesn't do:- Any of the above.\n\nThe sim is a very optimistic attempt to simulate bus driving, and the developers have to be commended for their efforts. The buses look and sound real, it's just that everything else does not.\n\nThe door controls in particular are a chore to operate, and negotiating give way junctions into moving traffic is not for the fainthearted.\n\nI enjoy playing car racing games, but perhaps if I was a professional racing driver I would not enjoy them at all.\n\nIf you like buses and fancy something different then give this one a go. You don't need a steering wheel to manage the buses. With a little practice you can even use your built in laptop mouse to steer.\n\nThe big downer in this sim is that a bus driver needs to be able to see both rear view mirrors and the full width of the bus without having to press a button or a control device to achieve that. Sharp right turns mean that you need to change view to watch your nearside mirror as you turn so you don't mount the kerb or collide wth any street furniture at the location. Then having made the turn, you need to change back to the default forward view to proceed safely. I know this can be achieved with a POV "hat" type of controller, but it still means trying to do two things at once to achieve a safe turn.\n\nI cannot really recommend the sim, largely due to the instability issues and the need for a high spec system to run it. There is also a fairly steep learning curve before you can get up to anywhere near service speed.","April 25","false","32.5"," 22 of 42 people (52%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","52","22","42","3","8"

I purchased this game when it was on sale.  I like the graphics, the buses, the fares and the routes.  The only thing I didn't like was that there was only one bendy bus and it was an old model that made an annoying squeaky sound whenever it went round a corner.  I then found out that the only other way to get more bendy buses was to purchase an add-on.  I wish omsi 2 had used the Man Custom Articulated Aus which is a newer model and doesn't make that annoying squeaking sound when it goes round a corner.  I also wish there were more routes.  I would really like to see an Australian version of this game.  One thing that dosen't make sense is that some passengers give you a $5 or $10 bill, for a ticket, but you can't use any bills as change.","June 21, 2015","true","61.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

The vanilla flavor of the game has only a whopping two maps to drive your Bus in, and only a handful of different buses to drive, many of them seem to be repeats. How ever, despite the two maps, one of them does have many different routes for you to take, so that's nice. From my experience, the other just has one.\n\nThis game does have a bit of a steep learning curve, and it did take me several attempts of picking it up and trying to go through the tutorials to figure out what was what, and then once I got that down, I had to try and set keys for my Logitech G27, which only added to the complexity, as you have more controls you need to be aware of for your bus then allowed on the Racing wheel's extra buttons. I'm not kidding, you literally control everything on the Bus. From doors to heating system, to interior lights to opening and closing your driver side window!\n\nBeyond that, driving a bus, picking up and unloading passengers is actually kind of fun. If you find a route that you like, you can find yourself sinking some time into this game, if you like running around in circles, that is. Of course you have to make sure you are not late, punch tickets, print tickets, give change to passengers, etc etc.\n\nThe biggest thing that stops me from enjoying this game is that it crashes for no apparent reason with almost no indication of an update from the developers in the near future. The last update, according to steam, was in May. This really makes you wonder if the developers are doing something for this game or not, or if I've missed something.. Granted they are adding DLC but there has been reports of crashes happening still.\n\nThere are mods you can download and add into this game, but I haven't dabbled to much. It might help you out, maybe fix the game crashes, but you should proceed with caution.\n\nDespite the game crashing bugs and the hard-to-learn controls, this game is .. Tolerable. Adequate. I would love to see where the developers take this game, but as far as I know, it's a hit-or-miss situation. Should you get it? Honestly, I wouldn't, at least not right now. The bugs in this game are to much to bare to really enjoy it. Believe me, I wanted to enjoy this game, but when it crashes in the middle of a route, I find that to be a little disappointing. You might have better luck then I do, and if you want to try your luck, go for it. Otherwise, I would stay away.","October 5, 2014","false","6.7"," 44 of 87 people (51%) found this review helpful","51","44","87","0","0"

Yes, setting it in late eighties to early nineties Berlin doesn't increase its sex appeal any more than announcing that Anne Widdicombe finally got a Brazilian either.\n\nHowever, there's something special about OMSI2 - Der Omnibussimulator 2, or simply put: The Bus Simulator 2 in English. It's truly magnificent if you want Germans to swear at you or if you want to waste half an hour on figuring out what "Ernerungsterif" or"Betriebsfahrt" means. It'll leave you frantically skimming though the manual as you try and figure out why the bus all of a sudden seized to move (curse you, auto kneeling mechanism), however all is forgotten the moment you roll out of the depot on a dark Sunday night as you make your way to your first stop though the calm Berlin streets. There's nothing quite like driving a night bus in BS2, your passengers, albeit few and far in between, really gives you a sense of satisfaction. Sure the passengers has about as much excitement and enthusiasm as the performers in a strip club has during their 9AM Monday morning performances but they still sit there in your bus, quietly waiting for their destination, they leave you thinking about who they really are. Is the younger chap five rows down making his way across town at his lovers behest.\n\nThe technical aspect of BS2 is less so, it crashes as frequently as Lindsey Lohan runs out of cocaine. The graphics is about as exciting as a carton of milk is to look at, you're lucky to find a tree with at least one polygon and god forbid you leave the carefully designated routes as you will encounter the sky dome with no warning whatsoever if you do.\n\nBS2 shouldn't be good, it shouldn't make me want to play it for hours on end, but something about is just so appealing. Maybe it's because the two people (really, two people made this) made this game purely based on the fond memories they had when they rode on the buses operating on the Berlin Municipal bus lines 25 odd years ago.\n\nIt's pure nostalgia and passion, the audio side of the game is nothing short of perfect and the game itself is nothing short of amazing. It doesn't take more than a minute or so behind the wheel of my bus of choice before I'm sitting feeling quite content with life.\n\nThe review submission page asks whether or not I recommend this game. Yes, BS2 is as polished as Battlefield 4 is and still are. Yes, it really is about driving a bus.\n\nIt's not for everyone, but I do recommend this in a heartbeat if you have even a vague desire to play this.\n\nI do, however, feel that I need to add more requirements to the list provided by the publisher:\n\nYou need a gamepad, preferably a wheel in order to drive in a way that doesn't look like you've had 6 racks of beer and 7 bottles of vodka.\nIt's also based in Germany so there's quite a bit of German language involved. They do have transcripts of what type of ticket the passenger wants in English as well as a manual and quick reference guide. But every single switch, knob and control interface on the buses are in German, good luck figuring out what a "Regler Heizlüfter vorne" or a"Nebelschlussleuchte" is.\nThe quick reference guide will save your life when you're in a bus full of people at FreudStrasse that won't move an inch.","December 23, 2013","true","83.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

OMSI can be quite expensive for what you get which is true, but excluding the paid DLC and main maps you get with the game; there is a huge library of fan made dlc content for this game that is completely free.\nYes you will have to read to make sure you install it correctly, but after the messing around with installing all the dlc into the programs main folder it’s a great experience.\n\nSo I would defiantly recommend this game for gamers that like there simulators.

It's set in Germany in the late 80's and early 90's, and you can drive buses from that era. You drive on bus routes with a timetable, pick up passengers, sell them tickets, and drop them off at their destinations.\n\nPros:\nRealistic controls. Each control on the dashboard does exactly what it would do on a real bus.\nGreat sound effects. The buses sound just like they do in real life, with gear changes, shakes, bumps, etc. There are also some nice sound details like outside ambient sounds becoming louder when windows are open.\nNice weather effects including rain and snow.\nLarge variety of different buses to drive, including single deckers, double deckers, and bendy buses.\nIncludes a map editor so you can edit existing maps or make your own.\nVarious mods that add extra buses, maps, etc.\n\nCons:\nNo Steam Workshop support for mods.\nThe English version of the game isn't fully translated, and some dialogue boxes are still in German.\nPerformance isn't great. You might have to lower the settings on larger maps to get a decent frame rate. Even on a high end PC it struggles on max settings.\nThe game can be unstable at times and randomly crash.\nOnly 2 maps are included with the base game. There are some DLC maps but you have to buy them separately.\n\nOverall I would give OMSI 2 a 7/10. It's pretty realistic, but it can be unstable and does lack in content without buying DLC or installing mods. Though the game was only made by 2 people, so you have to give them credit for what they were able to make.","December 9, 2015","true","3.7"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

Several rules apply though if you want to enjoy it:\n1) Be a bus simulator fan - if you aren't stay away. This isn't a fun car driving game! In fact it can be rather clunky... ;)\n2) Have a driving wheel - without it, there simply is no point as keyboard controls are annoying at best.\n3) Read the manual!!! - If you won't setup the bus correctly it will not register the stops on the route etc. Destination codes, routes and line codes is what you're looking for.\n4) Do not try to go outside of the routes - "City Car Driving" is what you need if you want to explore - otherwise, plenty of dead ends and "ends of the world" await.\n\nPro tip: Check out the online community for this game (and OMSI 1) if you want more maps. There are tons of them!\n","December 13, 2013","true","19.1"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Also the POS1 key is actually the HOME key.\n\nHowever once you get going its quite realistic, the sounds are very good, you can press all the buttons in the cockpit and they work, lots of various views including allowing the AI to drive the bus whilst you look round lol.\n\nVery good and recommended , needs a bit of refinement with the tutorial. hopefully we can download more maps in future for different countries.

The pride though of finally understanding what you are doing though, and completing your first route is enough to make you want to try it again. Different times, weather conditions, and busses in the base gamae alone are enough to provide varying gameplay to keep you amused.\n\nIf you like detailed sims, this is one for you.

The steering is relative heavy to use for Keyboard but VERY easy if you have a steering wheelm you're set.\nThe Tutorial for english was very broken at the start, but if I'm not wrong, they should be fixed now I think (Not sure)\nSound is perfect above perfect, it's perfect, they're really nicely made, and I never saw any flaws with them, the quality is amazing, and like every sound.\nThe Graphics are a mixture, the Bus self is VERY detailed, but the outside like the streets and buildings are a total meh, so you can tell by that, this game really fixated only on the bus and AI Busses, nothing really else.\n\nTL;DR                User Interface: 7/10\nSteering: 8/10\nSound: 10/10\nGraphics: 7/10\nAddition from previous game: Nothing big, new route, articulated busses, that's about it.\n\nI recommend that game to everyone, it's more stable then the release version, the additions are nice but very small, but it has articulated busses, that's the best part in this game.","July 17, 2014","true","383.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

OMSI 2 includes new buses, new routes, and a huge addition to the default map.  The Berlin-Spandau map has been extended to include Falkensee, previously only available through addons.  The new single-decker NL202 and articulated NG272, both highly detailed, are now also included as defaults in the game.  There are also audio files played whenever the player clicks the IBIS button to load the next stop.  There are, however, a few issues.  The increase in detail and size of the map has added a considerable lag factor.  Also (this may be a result of the lag), there are lots and lots of traffic glitches.  Vehicles will stop at traffic lights inside each other, and if you're driving the NG272, vehicles will run into the back of your bus.  Other than the few glitches currently in the game, OMSI 2 is a great follow up game that any OMSI fan should get.","January 4, 2014","true","35.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Where I could've gone on TS2014 and bought the London - Faversham pack for £25, but nope, the bendy bus & single-decker buses lured me into buying this game, hoping that my new TOSHIBA Windows 8.1 laptop would've been better than my previous one, in Grundorf its 25 fps which is great, but the map is boring and small.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jan_varhol/recommended/252530/","jan_varhol","Trucker Johny","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jan_varhol/","17 products in account","Performance: For me it is improvement. Please mind, that game is using only one core of processor and is 32bit so doesn't matter if you have big memory. Overclocked CPU and graphic card with at least 1GB memory will do magic. When you set antialiasing and so on graphics to override and fiddle with settings in the game, you can make it work easily.\n\nBugs after release: I have experienced some weird behaviour. Game crashing and so on, but after verification through Steam it downloaded some missing files so I think this is more Steam error that of Omsi developers. After that the game is not crashing anymore.\n\nContenet from Omsi 1: I had some problems, but it was pointed to me, that I was missing some files. After installing missing files, I managed to run all 5 of my favourite addons without any issues.\n\nGraphics: Yes, it is not state of the art, it is not very well optimized, but for me it is enough. I can create my own sceneries and other content.\n\nPhysics and realism: There is no real simulator, FSX, Trainz, or this Omsi. But Omsi is trying to get to deep details in siimulation. What you don't get on performance or graphics, you will be repaid when feeling the drive. In other games you don't feel connected, physics are off. In Omsi it feels spot on even no game has real world physics.\n\nDetails: You have button and gauge for everything like in real bus... And I mean every little button that is in the game is functional. You have realistic smoke coming out from exhaust, sounds of transimission, axles, doors, rattling of loose parts in interior. This is what you don't get in "fun" games. You may think you are getting very little for the price, but if you grasp the amount of detail in this game you will get it.\n\nPS: I am a big fan of Omsi1, even bigger of Omsi2. Developers of this game never lied. When something was not possible or they disliked it, they announced "forget it". If they are saying that they are gonna fix it, wait for fix and read new reviews.","December 15, 2013","true","326.3"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

OMSI 1 was a great game and still is but OMSI to is extremely buggy. so much so that the game does have to crash sometimes before it works. However with new patches and updates that hopefully come out to fix these problems once again this game will become great. I know that you can do it MR software as you have proved with OMSI 1. Anyway if you want a simulator with a fully working M.A.N bus with bendys doubles and single deckers this is for you. Roll sign and the modern electric signs with fully work IBIS.

If you have an interest in busses and how they actually work, this is for you. If you are an aspiring bus driver or just someone with an immense knowledge of these massive vehicles, this is the game for you.\n\nYou control everything, the bus (doors, passenger comfort, anything that can be opened or switched) , the climate (to the specific detail even) and even what happens.\n\nIf you only want to enjoy the Vanilla OMSI 2, that is all fine and dandy, it is excellent in vanilla, (aside from a few hicups here and there) but the full experience comes from modders who are bus fans like the creators of the game.\n\nI personally like the MAN NG272, which has superb sound effects, but if it was out of addon busses, it would go to the Mercedes Banz O530G Citaro and the Volvo 9900 Coach. Both are great and work greatly. The Volvo even goes as far as using MOBITEC Destination Displays with the MobiICU400.\n\nA game truly for the bus fan, one which gives you the most control over your environment and vehicle. If you are here for a simple sim, you might want to try City Bus Simulator 2012 or City Bus SImulator Munichen by Astragon Software.

I personally tought that 30 euro was a bit to much for this game since it's not like they added 10 new lines.. But since I veichle lover and loved the first Omsi but the lack of a bendy bus ruined it a lil bit for me.

It's extremely difficult to remember all of the keyboard controls so an Easy mode should cut back on these extras and just focus on driving, opening the doors and issuing tickets. - overall though this is a superb game for 3D simulator fans with a LOT of time on their hands, who are willing to learn all of the controls and stick to the bus schedule.","February 6, 2014","true","143.9"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Well here is the short of it.\n\nI was hesitant to buy it 6 or so months ago due to price and graphics looking iffy.  Watched a youtube  video and even that said somthing about it being good but complicated.  So i waited.\n\nAll I can say is I need help!  I can't stop playing it.  The sounds are phenomenal, the every button works is awesome.  I haven't setup my TrackIR yet, but i plan to, but even without it... it's awesome fun.  The graphics aren't the greatest but they're not horrible.  I don't even notice it anymore.  It's just relaxing fun to drive around and pickup passengers.\n\nI own the base game and three generations.  Both, I highly recommend.  I plan to get all the DLC.\n\nI simply wish there was more maps and buses to choose from.  It does have a learning curve but not much of one.  Getting over the trying to figure out German when I have no idea what anything says was difficult, but I finally know my ZEIL CODES!\n\nHighly recommend this simulator if you're a simulator fan.\n\nI own and really enjoy Euro Truck Sim 1 and 2, I've seen questions asked. Though Euro Sim is great fun, it's not really comparable.\n\nStop reading, go buy.

I have reinstalled several times the pc, with different OS (Win 7 and 8) and it keep crashing. It's stable only with the basic maps and busses... but like that is boring. Maybe the programmer should have waited a bit before releasing this version full of bugs. Going to Steam has improved the reinstall time and removed the pain in the ♥♥♥ activation with Aerosoft. On the other side with ver 1 you could have different copies in the HDD with different maps and busses so was easier to mantain and upgrade. With this version is not.\n\nA tip for the programmers: Why the hell you put the HOF files in the bus directory?? Wasn't easyer to have a HOF directory where all the maps where saving it so you avoid ton of copies of the same file and the maps where working with all the busses??\n\nIf you have patience and you love bus buy it.

I was really dissapointed, so i was playing the smallest map and only 1 route and i was getting bored of it. So after about one month i stopped playing, i dont recommend this game to anybody exepct if you meet well above the standards. The buses are pretty realistic and nice, the driving feels nice. The time and how to turn on the bus at the start is quite long and hard. Its sort of annoying since people wont really being playing this game to learn how to drive a bus. The passengers mean while sit like they're holding an invisble balland just dont move and yell complaints at you not great and the passengers almost are the same only about 10 diffrent passenger clothing. This is also in German i know how to speak some German but it is hard to understand and hard to learn how to drive. Then coming back to not using this for learning you would have to know german to learn how to drive, so if you live in germany its a real boost.

This was the predecessor of the highly successful OMSI the original, which in this game as standard comes with the two original maps. This game even though there is a small variety of DLC, you can find a lot of mods that will go with this game. My only complaint is that is can be a bit unfriendly and start bugging on you quite a lot, so you may need some patience if you have an old computer or a computer which could run the game but is going to explode if you make it do even more things (like my old laptop). For now though, this is the best of the best in bus simulators.","January 22, 2015","true","339.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

WTF IS THAT? I COULDNT GET FAR ENOUGH IN THE TUTORIALS TO FIND OUT!\n\nI really hope the developers fix this issue.. either way ive been RIPPED OFF.\n\nNOTE: Once it finally works, it will be the best game ive played in a long time... its the bugs and crashes that spoil it...\n\nso .... for the time being, until the stupid bugs are fixed.. i cant recommend this game... once its fixed, i will change it to positive as its a great game...

Of course, there are the occasional bugs and glitches, which may sometimes be annoying. I think that the best thing about OMSI 2 is the community. There are a ton of maps, buses, and mods for OMSI 2, and it enhances your gaming experience quite a bit. (I recommend getting the Three Generations bus pack)\n\nOne of the things that just sold me to OMSI 2 was the fact that you can use real-time weather and set up real-time weather for wherever you are! I also enjoyed the amount of detail that the developers put into OMSI 2, as it really shows off.\n\nHowever, I'm not going to just talk about the positives. A huge problem is the A.I traffic. It likes to cut you off, and generally causes 95% of the crashes you have. My solution to this is to turn off the physics for the A.I, so the vehicles who attempt to cut me off just go through my bus instead.\n\nIf you are thinking of picking up an accurate bus simulator and are a huge bus fanatic or love accurate simulators in general, then OMSI 2 is for you.","November 11, 2014","true","921.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It works with my Logitech Driving Force GT Steering wheel seamlessly and the game itself really does make you feel like you are driving a big, heavy, german bus.\n\nHowever, it does have some problems:\n\n1. There is not a massive range of bus mods to download that actually work and don't have texture issues. (Except Mercedes and Solaris buses, which are fine.\n\n2. There is not a huge range of maps avaliable and they are not too easy to install. (Some do download but require many other mods which makes the whole process a chore, searching around the german websites for the specific mods that the map needs is a real pain and puts me off downloading maps!)\n\nThe main problem with this game though is optimisation and performance. It rarely gets above 30fps and tends to drop to about 6/7 fps in the inner city areas of the berlin-spandau map. My PC is not amazing but will run most games at 30/60 fps. If the game becomes well optimised and there are more maps and buses added, this could be a hit, bestselling, A+ title.\n\nHowever, if you have a reasonably powerful PC (a steering wheel adds to the realism, I reccomend the Logitech Driving Force GT which is PS3, PS2 and PC compatible! It also has pedals and many buttons to add to the realism even more.) The game will be a joy to play and is oddly enjoyable, even when performance is an issue.\n\nOverall, Well done","June 23, 2015","true","25.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you are a pureist and want everything to be perfect it will probably drive you mad. If you don't mind some quirks there is a lot to like here. The detail on the bus models is amazing and the sheer complexity of all the things you can alter and change on the bus is quite overwhelming to begin with. Reading the manual and having a pen and paper handy to make some notes is a must. The attention to detail in the sound is something to behold. After a bit of digging on google I discovered that the destinctive transmission sound was so familiar because the busses that used to transport me to and from school in the UK used the same transmission as the double deckers on OMSI.\n\nLearning the routes takes some time and keeping to the schedule is very hard to do without upsetting the passengers. If you want a real driving challenge this will keep your mind active for a long time. There is just so much to consider all at once. It's very hard not to become flustered at first. Stay with it and you start to become pretty addicted to the challenge of getting that bus there in one piece on time with satisfied passengers. A lot of love has gone into this by the creators who have succeeded and then some IMO of encapsulating a period of history inside a game that brings a great deal of enjoyment to play.\n\n","July 21, 2015","true","55.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It comes with a few paid DLC packs, including Vienna, Hamburg and recently released Chicago which are all good, but some people don't realise you can download so many third party maps and buses.\n\nIt's one of the best driving simulators there is, in my opinion. It's just very prone to errors and freezing, it's not fully developed and at least for now it's easy to work around once you know what goes wrong. However, it really does make up for it for the amount of third party maps and buses you can download. Downloading maps - things very easily go wrong and that's where OMSI can hopefully improve in the future, in making the game stable and simpler to use, possibly. Once you understand basics of downloading buses and maps then it is usually easy to work with.\n\nI wouldn't recommend buying the game if you aren't going to download any maps however. You'll only have Berlin-Spandau and Grundorf which get very boring after a while. There are so many maps you can find, small and big ones.\n\nI do enjoy the game very much though and I totally recommend it!","June 29, 2015","true","459.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I have multiple games which require more RAM & etc.. and they have not had a SINGLE problem or lag. (Sounds like everyones dream right... no lag :P) Anyway now I cant play the game well and im really upset about that. I really enjoyed this game until now. At first I had it as a 8.5/10 but now I gotta admit its at about a 4/10.

We’d never have dreamed that these\ncompletely normal things would soon be part of the past.\nLike the many organizations that lovingly care for historical vehicles\nand take them out for traditional outings to try to keep the memory of\nthe past alive, we’re attempting to do the same thing in a completely\ndifferent medium and to give this trip in the past a whole new\natmosphere.\nWe wish you a lot of fun with OMSI 2!"\n\nMarcel Kuhnt and Rüdiger Hülsmann\nBerlin, October 2013","February 20","true","176.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Its old! The graphics are not great, but good enough. The AI passengers are copies upon copies of a handful of characters. The traffic AI is stupid. I suggest setting no collisions!\n\nOther main newest bus sim is the new Bus Sim 16 it is defo a game, there are no-real controls like in OMSI.\nThe nearest contender you will have seen me play before, (yes I am no newbie), is New York City Bus Sim.. Now that was good.. But it still is not as complicated as OMSI.\n\nOMSI is a great bus sim, if you want as true to life as it gets, It's not a 'game' as such, you will not just be jumping in and pressing go like in GTA!  This bus sim is relatively hard to learn, (one of the hardest games to learn), if not 'the-hardest' I have had the misfortune to want to play.   Nothing is simple in OMSI if you do not spraken de duch.\n\nEven the tutorials are worded from a German translation. Its not 'pass me the cup', (simple); it's 'cup me the pass'. All backwards like.  If you want a challenge, give it a go.\n\nThe tutorials don't really make any sense and are not simple and straight forward.  You'll have to mess about until you learn what they really mean, then you will act like a clever ♥♥♥ and say, 'Oh yea - its easy!' (When you know how).\n\nIf you have never played OMSI and this is your first ever outing, the tutorial will say things like..\n* You can see your driver file any time - but then not tell you how to access it..\n*The map is selfcontained infrastructure and temporal classification... err - what the heck does that mean?\n\nAnd many more funny and annoying misleading statements.. The funniest of which I reserve to the last..\nThey say in the tutorial. Like they know something you don't.. You are going to quit regularly...\n\nThey say: Tutorial 1.\n"To quit OMSI regularly, use the button - Quit OMSI". - -Well, all that seems none straightforward enough.. Lets Play OMSI...","June 6","true","11.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
