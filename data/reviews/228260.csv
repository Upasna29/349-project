"http://steamcommunity.com/id/FlamesSuperior/recommended/228260/","FlamesSuperior","UpInFlames","http://steamcommunity.com/id/FlamesSuperior/","263 products in account","Fallen Enchantress: Legendary Heroes is a unique game that tries to combine major elements from two of the biggest and best turn-based strategy series in history, namely Civilization and Heroes of Might and Magic. Just like in Civilization, you start by founding a city, you improve it with new buildings, and then expand by founding other cities and/or conquering other factions. But taking a cue from Heroes of Might and Magic, you explore the fantasy world with your hero(es), the battles take place in a separate screen and you can do quests to earn loot for your hero.\n\nIt’s a very interesting mix of two familiar concepts carefully designed into a surprisingly unique whole. For example, between dealing with other factions (whether you’re in war or not), you can scour the gameworld seeking out and completing various quests available to you whereas in Civilization there is not much to do in these moments except building your empire. On the flipside, it makes you miss certain elements from both Civilization and Heroes of Might and Magic. For example, even though you get to research civics, military improvements and magic just like you would research technology in Civilization, Fallen Enchantress: Legendary Heroes lacks the clear sense of progression. Or to use the city battles in this example, in Fallen Enchantress they are exactly the same as they are anywhere else on the map whereas Heroes of Might and Magic provides a compelling conquer/defend mechanic in its city battles.\n\nIt is perhaps unfair to compare this game so intensely to other games, but at the same time, there is no escaping the fact that these were very important and clear influences. The similarities aside, it needs to be pointed out that Fallen Enchantress totally nails the depth, scope and addictive nature that the genre absolutely requires. However, it does seem to favor the aggressive approach over the diplomatic one.\n\nThe production values are modest. The graphics are rather outdated, but this is offset to a point thanks to the truly wonderful and distinctive art-style. Unfortunately, there are no excuses for the sound design. The soundtrack consists of a scant few derivative fantasy melodies whereas the sound effects are just poor.\n\nFallen Enchantress: Legendary Heroes is a deep and addictive turn-based strategy game which doesn’t quite reach the very top the genre has to offer and as such won’t keep you playing for years to come, but it does offer a surprisingly unique mix of gameplay elements that will definitely delight any fan of the genre.\n\n8 OUT OF 10 (GREAT)","November 25, 2013","true","59.2"," 176 of 191 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","176","191","0","4"

If you're a fan of Sid Meier's Civilization series, this game MIGHT be up your alley. In my opinion, it is way better in many ways. A lot of people say differently... So here's a rundown of why I recommend this game:\n\n1) You get to have a 'main character', which you either pick from, or make your own through customization options. You can also make your own faction up, so to speak and pick your perks etc.\n2) There is an EXTREME PLETHORA of troop choices due to customization options to create the exact troop type you are looking for, You can even customize how they look, including gender. Seriously, this is an amazing thing that I haven't seen in too many other games of this type.\n3) The battle system is like a hybrid of regular turn-based strategy games of this nature, and something like a less-intricate version of games  like Final Fantasy Tactics, Fire Emblem, and Agarest (tactical battle games). See your unique leader and troops battle across actual landscapes, with terrain that affects movement and line of sight in a much more  detailed way than typical builder games. Strategize your positions. Feel like you're actually battling!!\n\nThere's really only one big problem I have with this game, and that would be the lack of multiplayer... I hear it crashes a lot, but I haven't really had much issue with this. Other than that however, I don't really see a whole lot wrong with it. I saw someone saying it's not a 'completed game' but I felt pretty content with it. I mean, I wouldn't go paying 40 dollars for it but I wouldn't pay that for almost any game, simply because that's a lot of money to me... I don't make that much...\n\nShould you buy this game...? It really depends on what you want in a game. If you're a high-fantasy fan who loves customization and city building, maybe. If you're a fan of grid-based tactical combat games, it just might be up your alley. If you like all of that stuff, you'll probably like this game. Should you spend 40 dollars on it? Ehhhh..... I wouldn't but if you have tons of money to blow, why not? I would honestly wait for a sale, or do some more research beyond my review... I hope i helped you out somehow in your decision however.","November 14, 2014","true","20.0"," 236 of 274 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","236","274","2","2"

I was really excited to play Fallen Enchantress: Legendary Heroes.  I'm a big fan of tactical and turn-based strategy games and I couldn't wait to dig in. On paper, this game has pretty much everything a strategy fan could ask for. Your developing kingdom or empire has a lengthy tech tree with three distinct branches. You can engage your armies in tactical combat, controlling each troops movements a la Tactics:Ogre or just let the battle play out automatically from the overworld. You can use your sovereign to cast tactical and strategic spells, decimate enemy armies, and tame dragons to fight alongside your army. You can even customize your avatar, kingdom history, racial traits, and design all of your units.\nThe list of things to do in this game is just about inexhaustible... which is likely where everything went wrong.\n\nThis game is an incredibly un-polished experience, so much so that I wonder if the devs even test-played it, as this very much feels like a game that is still in late beta stages.  In my opinion, this is because there's just so much going on, that the developers were incapable of playtesting everything thoroughly. I ran into more than a few save bugs and stability issues, and late game lag is incredibly common, even on a very high-end rig. While the environment art is pretty exceptional and overa-all enjoyable, I found the character models to be among the most hideous designs I've ever seen. They are amateur at best and downright ugly at worst. While not a core component, I did feel like something was lost in the customization when no matter which outfit I picked, my sovereign still turned out to be an eyesore.\n\nBut, due to the insane levels of customization and depth of gameplay, all of these foibles could be easily overlooked if not for one glaring, inescapable issue.\n\nThe AI in this game may be the worst artificial intelligence I've ever encountered in a game of any kind. There are extremely limited diplomacy options, which basically boil down to: pay money, or be paid money for peace, neither of which are very fun or exciting. While more are unlocked later in the game, you're unlikely to ever see them before going to war. The AI seems to have one goal and one goal only: to declare war. It might declare war in the first five minutes of meeting you, or it might wait for five hours, but you can be damned sure it's going to happen.\n\nThe way that the AI decides friend from foe is a complete and utter mystery to me. More than once, the enemy AI went from being my best friend (green happy face) to being at war with me the next turn, which was completely baffling. Once at war, the AI will throw every platoon it has at you. It will send all of its troops straight to their death, over and over again, never adjusting its strategy, until it has completely exhausted all of its kingdoms resources and must surrender to you.\n\nAt the end of the day, I want to recommend this game so badly, because there is just so much going on that begs to be explored. But no matter how great the rest of the game is, there is just no way around the AI.","January 15, 2014","false","61.4"," 352 of 439 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","352","439","0","16"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/regicider8/recommended/228260/","regicider8","Reggie","http://steamcommunity.com/id/regicider8/","377 products in account","When I first saw what Stardock wanted to do with Fallen Enchantress, I became excited. All those video diaries about the lore of the world, the customization options, and the options for what you could do made me very excited for the game! Then I paid $40 for a complete mess of a game that, aside from being buggy, was very much a half ♥♥♥♥♥ project that did not live up to my expectations. I gave up on that, but then I heard of the "expansion" to a bad game with a great concept: Fallen Enchantress: Legendary Heroes! Although it looked like the exact same game for the exact same price, it couldn't be completely the same, right? They probably had to change EVERYTHING to fix it, essentially creating a new game, right? Nope. As far as I'm aware, there is no difference except for maybe a new faction and maybe a new map. As such, here are the reasons why not to give Stardock any more money ever.\n\n1). Tedious city building.\nTo me, this game looked very much like a customizable game of Civilization that, considering the modders of the popular Fall from Heaven mod for Civ IV were working on this, I expected it to play like Civilization. However, although some aspects of city building are similar to the Civ series, it falls considerably short of it. Settling of cities can only be on certain places, and those places start with a predetermined Food, Production, and Mana. Once you place your city, there is no way to work the surrounding land to enhance them. Instead, you gain more "resources" by building outposts next to resources (iron, crystal, and mana) and then build upgrades on those resources. Your cities do not take part in this process, instead being used solely for unit production. Although you can build buildings to "improve" your cities, they never really seem to improve them that much. The game decided to follow "a lot of a little is a lot" making city progression a very long and tedious task that does not factor in units or later buildings, meaning they take FOREVER to build.\n\n2). Pointless Unit customization.\nIn the game, you start off with a hero and a settler. You can explore and complete quests with your hero, and found a city with your settlers. Once your city is founded, you are allowed to customize units much like you can customize your hero. At first this sounds really cool; the possibilities are seemingly endless with the amount of equipment you can give your troops to improve them. But then you realize that equiping a troop with horses doesn't make them cavalry, or that equiping them with spears doesn't make them spearmen. Instead, the game simplifies combat to three basic unit types: Ranged, melee, magic. As you can guess, each type dictates how each unit attacks, either from range with a bow or magic, or up close with a variety of melee weapons. Although each weapon has a unique "attribute" that gives them additional functionality, these attributes hardly matter during battle. The only thing that matters is how hard each weapon hits, which leads me to my next point.\n\n3). Simplistic, boring, unbalanced combat.\nThe game was trying to go for a hybrid between TurnBasedStrategy and TurnBasedTactics. In this case, combat takes place on a relatively small grid (reminiscent of chess) with environmental textures that add nothing to said grid. Both teams start on opposite sides of the grid and must kill each other. This is typically how combat works in TurnBasedStrategies(like Tactics Ogre or FFTactics), however, it is not handled well. The only variety of the combat grid involves the textures, so every battle will essentially play out the same way. Mix that with units that have no range limits, and early battles become a slogfest that is determined by how many ranged units you have/can kill quickly. The most complex tactic is which unit to focus fire on. There is no positioning/elevation advantage, useful abilities, unit variety advantage, or change in AI behavior. The AI have a suicidal mentality, and why wouldn't they? It doesn't matter if they die while targetting a single unit, they are only there to be a pawn in the great battle of attrition. If this sounds like the game is challenging, don't fall for it. This only affects early game, late game is a cake walk due to how OP troops become. Troops, unlike heroes, can be upgraded in SIZE, meaning that more soldiers will be in that troop. This increases the health and damage of the troop unit with each additional member. This means that troops will EASILY out perform any amount of heroes at any level with any equipment. These essentially godly units can only be countered by other godly units, which are...never made. Once you reach the max level of equipment, its smooth sailing.\n\n4). All around lack of variety.\nOverall, there is very little variety in gameplay. All the possibilities of the game are quickly exhausted after a few hours. The only victory condition I am aware of is conquest, making the game easily beaten and done with. There is no point to unit variety, so unless you want to create a challenge for yourself, there is no reason to change it up. With no random map generation, Stardock has resorted to selling map pack DLC for maps that add no actual variety or unique experiences to the game. Aside from singleplayer random game, there is a "story/campaign" that apparently tells a lore driven story of...something. I have played the campaign and found it very similar to a random game with extra random scenarios. It is apparent that the developers wanted the antagonist faction to be an overwhelming superpower that the player had no chance of standing up against, but I felt no sense of ugency to complete the story objectives. The final objective is for you to bring your hero into a portal and fight demons as a final resort to stop the "invasion"(or something), but I found myself conquering their unneccessarily large quanitity of cities with ease(once again, late game cakewalk). However, stepping into the portal is a completely different story. Apparently your hero forgots to bring his army, because its him against max level demons. As you would expect, he gets easily slaughtered. This HUGE difficulty spike is artificial and unfair, as there is no way of preparing for it. Apparently the only way to win is to use magic the scenario GIVES YOU, meaning there is no way to prepare or create a solution.\n\nIn conclusion, if you like the premise of a customizable TBS/T game that is probably easily modded(?), then this game is right up your alley. It is VERY rough and definitely needs a modder's touch, but the core concepts are there and, in the end, that's all you can hope for...*cries*","November 28, 2014","false","14.5"," 323 of 406 people (80%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","80","323","406","5","14"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/228260/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","Fallen Enchantress: Legendary Heroes is a single player 4X turn-based strategy game that takes place in the fantasy universe of Elemental. Following a magical apocalypse, civilization is trying to recover and reestablish itself in a world now filled with bandits, monsters, and rival factions. These are all just flavor details, of course — without a real “campaign” to play through, the setting and back story are largely irrelevant, but the effort is nonetheless appreciated.\nPlayers set out to found a fledgling kingdom, scout out the world for resources to gather, grow their empire, and ultimately eliminate any opposition — your standard 4X fare. What set this game apart from most in the 4X genre are the titular legendary heroes, the first of which is the sovereign of your nation. RPG-like mechanics allow you to embark on mini-quests, recruit new heroes, level them up, and find loot with which to equip them — an exciting addition to the base 4X gameplay.\nThis breaks the game down into two main components: empire building and tactical combat. Building your empire involves founding new cities, researching technology, building city upgrades, and managing resources. Various “buff” spells can be cast on a city to boost it in some way, the research paths allow you to unlock numerous upgrades, and cities can be augmented into military fortresses, arcane research centers, or expansionist metropolises.\nThe empire building aspect of the game is par for the course in the genre — no major flaws, but nothing exceptional either. After a few games, I realized that selecting upgrades and research paths will ultimately become repetitive, but thankfully there’s a lot more that Fallen Heroes has to offer to keep a player engaged.\nThat’s where combat comes in, the basis of which is building units and, more importantly, recruiting heroes. This also happens to be where Legendary Heroes comes into its own. By expanding your towns and completing quests, you will gain “fame,” which will grant you access to new hero units. All units gain experience points and levels, but heroes can be upgraded into different classes such as Assassin or Defender, gain access to skill trees, and equip items much like an RPG character. The choices here are diverse and exciting, and even your base units can be upgraded with weapons and armor of your choosing as you unlock technologies.\nWhen your army clashes with an enemy’s, a neutral faction’s, or a wandering monster, you’ll enter a turn-based tactical combat phase. Units take turns moving around the combat grid, attacking, using abilities and items, and casting spells. Initiative, defense, attack, hit points and more all factor into how combat plays out, as well as the specific gear your units have equipped. Even base units have access to an ability or two, depending on their equipped weapon — a spear may grant a piercing strike that hits two enemies at once, while a club may grant a devastating power attack that costs the attacking unit its next turn.\nCombats themselves are strategic, diverse, and just plain fun. A “swarm” mechanic acts somewhat like the “flanking bonus” other game systems use, imparting a bonus to an attack made against a foe adjacent to one or more allied units. This makes tactical positioning and smart use of the battlefield an important part of the game, and using the right ability or spell at the right time can be crucial to victory.\nWhile there are multiple paths to victory, the end-game weakens significantly as you widen your lead over your opponents. At that point, the question is no longer if you will win, but how many more bloody turns will it take. Perhaps this is just the curse of the genre, but the later into a game I got, the more I found my excitement being replaced with tedium. Once victory was assured, I would simply start a new game.\nThankfully, “replay value” would be the two words that best describe Legendary Heroes. The degree of randomness that goes into every game, coupled with the variety of options at your disposal and a high degree of customizability ensure that no two playthroughs will ever be the same. There are so many variables interacting with each other that you’ll want to come back again and again to see how a different setting, a different selection, or a different tactic will play out.\nWhile I haven’t played Elemental: Fallen Enchantress, I’m given to understand that Legendary Heroes includes upgraded graphics, which I can’t comment on. Other improvements over the base game consist of two new factions, larger map sizes, a new scenario, as well as new monsters, items, spells, and quests. There’s word that Legendary Heroes was also meant to introduce bug fixes and performance optimizations, but I encountered a few crashes and clunky slowdowns during my play experience.\nFallen Enchantress: Legendary Heroes is the kind of 4X that brings my relationship with strategy games to a lofty peak. It is engaging and yet oddly meditative, almost relaxing to play rather than nerve-wracking and brain-frying.\n\n","July 28, 2015","true","104.2"," 83 of 104 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","83","104","2","0"

While it offers a large amount of content, there is still something missing.\nWell, what is good:\n\nMany different nations to play, and this is not orcs, dwarves and other elves we already seen in hundreds of other games. This is unique nations, mainly based on humans, with their own history.\nYou can create your own nation and choose its strengths and weaknesses, i especially love this aspect of game.\nThere is a constructor of units, you can create your own troops - arm soldiers with different weapons and armor, give them abilites and perks, this is quite complex system which offers a lot of tactics.\n\nLot of different technologies to research, separated in three groups: economy, warfare and magic. You need to build cities carefully and specialise them, city focused on training troops is very different from city focused on research.\nExploring of map is good too, there is different quests you may find as well as lot of treasures and monsters roaming around. Hiring heroes and developing them are important, in fact first part of the game, where you explore the map, hire heroes, locate resources and fight wildlife is the best part of the game. It is really good.\n\nResource management is simple and logical. There is resource spots on map and you need to build cities or outposts to control this spots. For example, if you have an iron mine, it will provide some iron each turn and you can spend this iron on units with iron equipment. And so on.\n\nWell, it sounds like perfect game, but there is several moments that can not let me call Fallen Enchantress "perfect".\n\nFirst of all, there is very weak AI. Almost non-existent. AI nations are very passive, they can not offer a challenge. AI can not use all possibilities that game offers. And if you decide to increase difficulty level, AI will just have extra resources and bonuses. This is simply not interesting.\nYou ask about balance? There is some issues with balance, it will take some time to explain this problems anyway... they exist, balance is not perfect at all.\n\nDiplomacy is plain and simple. If your nation are weak then AI will declare war on you. If your nation is strong then AI will not declare war on you. That is all. Of course, there is pacts, alliances and trade treaties, but i do not think there is much benefit from this.\n\nAs for quests. In general, they all fit in simple formula "go somewhere, find something and maybe kill someone in process". But, to be honest, it is hard for me to invent something different so, well, quests are OK.\nBoss fights become disappointment for me. From very start, game told me a scary story about "big, giant, enormously huge dragon that is extremely powerful". Well, alright, i methodically gathered all my best troops and cautiously approached to boss domain, ready to retreat in any moment. There i saw a dragon and, well, my archers shot him and my pikemen poked him. Dragon died. That was all. It was not the epic battle i expected for...\n\nPace of game is very slow. Really slow. You can find yourself not playing but just pressing one button - "end turn", waiting for something to happen. Yes, you can regulate the pace of game, but even on fast speed it seems slow for me.\nI did not finished any games i started in Fallen Enchantress. Because when you have a powerful army and strong economy, there is nothing that can stop you. It is simply not interesting. I can conquer all map and resistance is futile... preparations for war is much more interesting than war itself. And it was a huge disappointment for me because complex system of troop creation is really good and combat system are well designed.\n\nLast drop is multiplayer. I mean there is no multiplayer. You want to proof your friend that your strategy and tactics are superior? Not in this game, unfortunately.\n\nWell. Can i recommend this game? Yes and no. If you love to slowly and carefully build your Glorious Empire in fantastic world - this game is just about it. But if you want challenge from AI or want to play with friends - this is not good choice, try to check Dominions or Age of Wonders.\n\nFor me game is good enough, i will play it from time to time.","November 21, 2015","true","22.2"," 52 of 58 people (90%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","90","52","58","2","0"

While no game has really encompassed the rest of the details of this dream, this game does get a lot of it right. I've enjoyed playing this game and seeing it evolve even since Elemental. I do not think it's a perfect game by any means, but it's a lot better than what it started from. The problems that it suffers from aren't anything major. It's just a lot of little stuff here and there that tends to add up to an experience that feels slightly flawed but not in the context of a flawed gem. It's rather difficult at times, and given my experience with the game I can't always say it's been my fault either. There is a strong "rogue-like" vibe with some of the monsters that roam the map and I'm certainly not complaining about this. You have to pick and choose your fights, but often this is a bit deceptive in that I'm sure I THINK I could beat this whole nest of spiders because they are close to my army's power. It doesn't mean however said spiders won't shoot webs all over the tactical map so my melee units can't even move, then pick everything off with poison. Then other times you just romp over them like sewer rats. I'm not 100% sure I love random in my strategy games, but I do love it in my RPG games. That's kinda where this game stands too. It's half strategy and half RPG. I don't feel like it does either amazingly well, but there's just not many games that put these things together and have it cohesive. There's times where I'm not even sure if I'm playing the game right and I still have no idea what I should be doing. The point is though: It's fun to try.\n\nAny fan of Civilization that doesn't mind trying to defend their nation from literally being eaten by dragons should check it out. If you want a relaxed city-building experience, then look elsewhere as the game isn't catered towards pacifists and fighting is largely the entire point of the game with the empire building not quite in the background, but most certainly second stage.\n\nAnother note: the developer has added a ton of content and balancing to the game on a regular timeframe. A larger "2.0" update is incoming as I write this as well as another expansion of sorts. I'd much rather see a company funded that has the idea that they will refine their game until they can justify paid content, over one that just sidecars new DLC every 3 months because they can. The DLC for this game is 100% not needed for a great experience and there's some rather large MODS that completly change the game's dimensions if you are into that kinda thing.

Hands down. Think Galactic Civiliation 2, and add character creation (you create your hero, as if this was an rpg. i.e faces, hair, etc) armor (hands, torso, legs, feet, head, rings etc) and faction creation (you can create your own faction, similar to Galactic Civiliation 2.) Random generated maps and pre-made ones (I prefer skirmishes and huge maps, I  don't like playing the same map over and over)\n\nThis is probably the only fantasy game that falls under the 4X category, It has so much rpg aspects as well as strategy, city management and everything in between. If you like Heroes of Might & Magic, this will replace it. Completely. If you are hesitating, try it out.

Civilization + Heroes of Might & Magic is in general a great idea for a game. The problem is in the execution.\n\nThe good:\n-Lots of customization of your empire and character before you even start a game, including the look of everything.\n\n-Battle mode is engaging with good use of terrain and a variety of available tactics, with much deeper spell tactics than the typical HoMM game in particular.\n\n-If a battle is going to be a waste of time to run or you are running a very simple army, auto-resolving a battle will not result in an unfair result for you, so you don't have to fear losing units because you don't want to waste time on a nothing battle.\n\n-Empire UI is not the best and clearly inferior to Civ 5, but when you end your turn, it does not take long for computer turns to resolve even if there are lots of them. The game progresses pretty rapidly.\n\nThe bad:\n-This game starts slooow. Your empire is tiny and difficult to grow. It really needs a fast start option where you start with several cities and heroes to get things rolling.\n\n-Most of the units you control are uninteresting. Prepare for a lot of soldiers and archers, rather than actual cool fantasy monsters. Some factions have special units, though.\n\n-Questing is not well-balanced and can easily lead to an army wipe with little warning, followed by a monster rampaging across your territory until you can get rid of it many turns later.\n\n-Juggling a large army becomes progressively more time-consuming and I found myself just parking large stacks wherever or wasting them on supermobs just so I didn't have to pay for them.\n\n-It's a difficult chore to defend map tiles you control. Any monster or enemy player can come in at any time from any angle and you have no way to get rid of them without sending out an army to deal with it. A ranged attack from city (a la Civ 5) would do wonders. Enemies can take over large swaths of your territory if you don't have a city there simply by planting a guy on your outpost. No battle, that territory is now his.\n\n-You can easily get a start position that completely screws you over in a random map, almost regardless of what settings you pick for random generation.\n\n-The various research trees are not well-balanced and you can easily bork your early development.\n\nIn the end:\nThis game really illlustrates why it's hard to make a good empire-building game or combine two popular games into one. It's not an easy fit.","December 31, 2013","false","18.2"," 105 of 146 people (72%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","72","105","146","0","2"

Eg. trying to reorder building queues (in the cramped 5 items at a time icon list) will often select the wrong item.  The mouse isn't locked to the window, so on multiple monitors, you can't hit the screen edge to scroll right.  There's no way to combine or rearrange armies occupying the same tile.  I frequently found some stray click when trying to cast a spell, or even in the loading screen inadvertently ordering armies in the wrong direction.  And a bunch more minor, but frustrating issues.  It just makes the whole thing a pain to deal with.\n\nThe game itself is decent, but it seems like it could have done with a lot more balancing and polish.  So far, I've only played through 2 games, but so far it seems like certain strategies and factions are OP, while others struggle.  The optimal strategy seems to be to cut taxes completely, pretty much ignoring gold altogether for the early game, since the unrest penalty isn't worth the tiny amount it gets you, meaning a third of the buildings are pretty much pointless.   It seems like there's the potential for a great game here, and maybe mods could help with this, but as it stands, it doesn't quite come together as well as it could.\n\nIf it weren't for the UI issues, I'd definitely recommend giving this game a try, but as it is, I don't think it's worth the frustration.","August 11, 2015","false","59.4"," 40 of 48 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","40","48","0","0"

Let's find out..\n\nFirst off, the ((tutorial)): videos and encyclopedia feature explains most of the basics very well, so the learning curve is pretty smooth. So even though it is clearly a complex game, it's not hard to learn and play with most of the features. You still have to experiment yourself to master the customization features, which is great cuz such features are usually up to experienced players to make use of them anyway.\n\nThe ((campaigns)): were mostly boring. They emphasized the RPG aspect of the game (hero leveling and skill trees, magic casting and equipment etc..), but it also had some of the most repetitive quests ever, which is a shame cuz the story and lore are rather well-written. Unfortunately, you never feel attached to the characters in the campaign. They feel like robots, and you are playing with them only cuz you have NO OTHER CHOICE. Also the research tree is often reduced/butchered, even though it is one of the best features in this game... Ignore the campagin!\n\nThe ((customization)): Here's where this game really shines! Where do I begin?\nFirst time playing, you might want to pick one of the standard races to play, so you can learn the basics and experience which type of gameplay you prefer >> science victory, diplomatic (almost pointless), Quest victory, or all-out DOMINATION.\nThere is attention to detail in the factions. On their own, they are well-balanced. Their different abilites actually greatly impact their play-style, even MORE here than in Civilization 5 for example.\n\nLater on, when you enter the cauldron and make your own faction (better with the Leader Pack DLC), here's where you get to produce some game-breaking (and pretty fun!) factions, like giving them supreme unit bonuses for combat OR giving them several opened-up researches for a quicker science victory...\nUnit customization in-game is even MORE fun and you can make use of the resources at your desposal depending on what you have and how much you have of each... You can edit everything: cosmetics/facial features, colors, weapons, armor, magic trinkets and special perks.\n\nThe research tree and city building: These are the second best features here. The research tree has geat impact, and you feel the difference with each upgrade almost immediately. In fact, factions with high research bonuses will most likely win easily if they are given enough time and space. You need to attack them ASAP if you're playing military style...\nGrowing your city and gaining territory is actually addciting here, also with great immediate impact, depending on your decisions. You get bonus buildings with growth etc..\n\nI'm not gonna say much about combat: bacis tactical style. Nothing remarkable. Heroes are better playing in support function with abilities rather than tanking or dealing damage (unless you have exceptional items). They don't die permanently either. You will mostly rely on your melee units to deal damage and tank.. and pretty much do everything in combat... everything else is just support. It's all about making melee units PLUS upgrading them ASAP before the epic monsters show up at your doorstep and ruin your life...\n\nThe biggest PROBLEMS with this game are:\n1) Unit models: despite all the customization, the unit models are remarkably UGLY! Whatever facial features you pick for your sovreign/hero you will rarely find him/her looking the way you want. The graphics, while sharp, are overall not appealing compared to other games in this genre.\n2) Diplomacy: many features BUT unclear! You have no idea why your rivals like you one minute and HATE you suddenly. You might be fighting a common enemy one minute, then 15 turns later they declare war one you even though you are clearly much stronger than them. No rhyme or reason to dimplomacy... and no point in the diplomatic victory mechanic. War is more frequent and more profitable.\n3) Starting locations: The main reason why some factions win is most likely gonna be affected by the abundance of resources and tile yileds on starting locations. City locations on Essence yields are more powerful than any other, especially when improved with city spells. And if you don't start with at least 2 crystal  and 2 iron near you... you are gonna have a hard time upgrading your units later on. It almost makes the customizations pointless cuz all of the advance items and equipment require these resources! The starting locations are IMBALANCED in the custom games... and the AI makes poor decisions when settling new cities.\n4) NO MULTIPLAYER!\n\nThe DLC: depending on how you like to play>>\nIf you want better customization and custom game variety: Leader Pack DLC + Map DLC\nIf you want an extra race with unusual mechanics: Dead World (for playing as undead)\nIf you like to play around mainly with hero quests and epic equipment: Loot Pack + Quest Pack\nBattlegrounds DLC: I don't own this one because it sounds pointless. Why would I want more map variety if there is NO MULTIPLAYER?\n\nThey don't affect each other very much. Right now, I only recommend Leader Pack and Map pack (I like the customization), cuz the extra loot gets boring quickly and the Dead Nations have lots of bugs and/or poorly balanced. The extra quests can be fun, but I find them just distracting me from conquering other factions instead, or going for straight up science victory.\n\nUltimately, it's a fun game, BUT I only recommend buying it on a big discount. It is NOT worth the full current price imo\n7/10\n\nThis is my playthrough using a custom faction for Magic/Science Victory:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANWPt0PlLWQ&list=PLP90♥♥♥lxXzixV1v74MxSOg3CJp_Cr3-u","June 3, 2014","true","195.0"," 31 of 35 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","31","35","0","0"

However, the execution just doesn't cut it: from the lack of variety, uninteresting factions, and bland presentation - including unappealing looks AND poor perfromance at the same time - to the way the tech tree, hero progression, equipment price / gold production ratio (wtf 40 turns to buy one piece of leather armor?!), and available spells combine to create an experience that kept me dozing off most of the time - even when my entire army suddenly gets wiped out by a random encounter (wandering monsters tend to be much more powerful than all competing factions combined.)\nSorry for not being more specific, as it would take too long.

Eliminating the multitude of different damage & armor types for universal consistency & weapon specific special moves does slightly erode some tactical decisions.

I know, many games are modable, but here is the game where almost all cons are addressed by the mods. And it is possible as  you can mod almost anything starting with graphics and going deep in to game play.  So, some reviews point out that AI is passive and not challenging?  Not so with the mods. It will be competent and agressive, expanding, building armies, using magic with right mods, particularly with xtradeconstruct.\n\nNot enough factions, a bit  dry lore - children of storm introduce new ones with new unique units and lots of lore described. Together  with some other mods I have about 30 factions, some of which like ice giants, centaurs,  spider people are very unique and all of them well thought through.\n\nWant more heroes with different skills,  from different races, then go with Champions Bonanza.\n\nTwice as  much as vanilla the number of new techs, specific for different factions - xtradeconstruct.\n\nWith major mods, the game looks polished and complete. And that  way it absolutely gets where it wants to be - fairly balanced, civilization like fantasy game with great  amout of variety, strategy and tactics.\n\nI certainly recommend it to every person, who is looking for best 4x titles to play.

Also, a great fantasy-based mpa makes the game more challanging: it is not just the other kingdom nor the empire your enemies, but the A.I. monsters. Quests are also available in game to gain experience, fame( which gives champions at certain level ). It also provides different ways to win the game: solving some EPIC quests.\n\nWhen it goes to combat, the game has a wide range of spells, tyes of troops. Each provides customized style of tactical gaming. What would you be? A master in sword, a summoner or a assassin in shadow?

What it loses is interesting combat, reasonable game lengths, software stability, and user interface.\n\nThere are some flaws that are particularly aggravating.  The game decides on its own when a player has completed his turn and  automatically enters the AI cycle, often when the player isn't completely finished.  The spells seem to range from worthless to overpowered without managing to make the combat more interesting.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Seranth/recommended/228260/","Seranth","Seranth","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Seranth/","1189 products in account","Fallen Enchantress is a 4X fantasy turn-based strategy game that mixes in turn-based tactical combat. I can't recommend it because it uses DRM (Stardock one-time online activation and registration) and mentions nothing on the store page (unlike games like GTAIV and Earth 2160 which disclose it properly). The actual game is mostly fine, but there are several points I'd like to see improved:\n\nThe game pacing setting that says "a game with accelerated technology progress" also affects turn limit. It should only affect how fast techs are researched and there should be a separate setting for game length.\nI found the initiative list to be somewhat annoying to use- when I hover over a unit portrait on the list I'd expect to see the unit highlighted on the battlefield. Unfortunately it only works the other way around so you have to search one-by-one if you want to target something high on the initiative list.\nNeeds shortcuts to target multiple/all units in an army for strategic spells. Ctrl+click and Shift+click don't work so you have to cast separately for every unit.\nMovement isn't forgiving- you can't allocate unused movement points after you move once (you move and you're stuck there, even if you misclicked).\nYou should be able to queue up research on the tech tree. Currently you can only set one tech as a goal.\nWhen researching end-game repeatable tech, you should be able to choose 'continue research' to research it again\nRecruitable heroes that aren't humanoid in either size or shape aren't able to wear armor even if you take the chainmail/plate hero skill when levelling up. There should be a trait that says they cannot wear armor and you shouldn't be able to spend a point on that hero skill.\nNeutral enemies are friendly to AI. I've had outposts and cities destroyed from neutral units and then watched as they ignored the AI cities built on the same location turns later and never be attacked while the threat waits outside.\nIn battle if your ranged unit is too far away then it moves the camera to that unit. That's fine to identify the unit, but I would like the option to turn that off because it moves the camera away from the enemies and I need to scroll back to the action to attack.\nThe orange pickaxe icon sometimes means that there's a resource on that spot. However, other times it shows only resources that can be improved/available which is a lot more useful. I have no idea why/how to trigger it.\nWhen you have two armies on the same tile it seems like you can't choose who will defend an attack. So if you want to safely protect a weak unit like a pioneer/noblewoman that has to pass by an enemy, it needs to be in the actual army (and you have to hope the enemies don't kill them).\nThere's a quest where a hunter thought his dog was killed by wolves. You find that his dog joined the wolves but there's an item you can use to tame beasts. However, even if you get the dog to join you're forced to say he's dead.\nCrashes occasionally, more than Civ 5 and less than Eador: MotBW.\nThere are random bugs that occur. Rarely the game wouldn't let me move directly onto the square with an enemy's outpost to capture it. I got to move onto the square by clicking another tile but it still wasn't captured. Once I couldn't finish a monster zone (Delin, Pyre of Man). I cleared all monsters (confirmed with world vision spell) but couldn't get treasure from 'Remnants of the Inferno' tile even when moving onto it with a hero.\nThere are a few typos, incorrect grammar, incorrect quest descriptions.\nThe first scenario has a few bugs. It says you get +1000(?) crystal and later +1000(?) metal as quest rewards but you don't really get it. Another quest says it gives 10000 metal but at least you receive 1000. Occasionally there are treasure tiles that don't give rewards and don't activate when you stand on them.\nThe second scenario has a lot of unnecessary dialogue popups. As you get stronger you get the usual 'AI doesn't like you' dialogue but they didn't disable it for your permanent allies. You can also trade (but no treaties) with your enemies even you're you're in permanent war. The funny thing is that in my playthrough Resoln was the weakest of the enemies in score for the whole game when you'd expect better from the story. Difficulty seems hard-locked to Beginner/Easy AI. Kraxis never pushed into Capitar while I did my own thing for the first >265 seasons before bothering to move east.\nSometimes the game doesn't exit properly and keeps running in the background.\nOne of my bigger gripes is that there isn't a way to turn off time victory. You can't take it slowly and explore/build up everything before time runs out, so you are forced to go for a win condition. That might be fine for some people but I wanted to fully explore the game when I was learning the mechanics. It also means you don't have the time to on a power trip by building up everything and then taking over the world with maxed-out heroes and units. The 'Continue the Adventure!' button at the end of the game only links you to the Amazon page for their book series and doesn't let you continue the game past the time limit.\n\nOther random thoughts:\nIn the second scenario, Resoln didn't even have a coastal city like in the first scenario.\nWhen you zoom out to see the full world map, it's funny that any land that touches the border extends infinitely instead of being rounded off with coast.","September 18, 2015","false","6.9"," 16 of 22 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","16","22","0","2"

At first it was a little hard and I didn't know what to do. I quickly lost my first scenario as I was overrun by both wild creatures and enemy forces, but I felt like I learned from that first atempt. I used my new knowldege to fire up the same scenario again. This time I got much further but eventually I lost again. With each defeat I learned more and used that knowledge to improve my game. I learned that when I make custom units if I want to be able to upgrade them to plate mail later I need to give them the plate mail ability even if my current armour is only leather.I also learned that once a unit is trained as a foot soldier of some type it can not be given a mount latter on (I don't like that rule but knowing it helps out).\n\nthere are small differance between the factions but I don't really see that much of a differeance between how the factions play. The biggest differeance is the Sovierng you start with.\n\nI wish there was some form of multiplayer even if it was hot seat. I also wish there was naval units/war fare. Whenever you run into a body of water there is no way to hop on a boat and travel. Still I've had lots of fun playing this game. Especially when fighting dragons and other big optional bosses on each map.","October 2, 2014","true","82.0"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","11","14","0","0"

I like the idea champs level up and can use items.  The customization is awesome. To be able to design a unit type during play and start producing them is outstanding.  For the most part the game is fun and easy to use.  Now for some of the things that you should be aware of before you jump in.  Serious pathing issues on game. for example it will show that you can make it to the enemy in one move. showing a straight line.  when you click button your pawn is sent off on a zig zag course and does not make it there or leaves you in an enemy controlled zone even though your army and enemy army were in your zone. This sometimes leaves your army open to a spell attack that can seperate or decimate your army alowing the enemy to mop your army up.  unfortunately once movement has begun there is no way to stop. some operations require double click and other single.  This lends to accidental clicks and the auto end turn finishing turn before your done.  lastly the most frusting for me, but bare in mind i stlll like to play, is on larger maps when map is nearly all occupied.  The game starts crashing.  At first i thought memory issues or graphics or what not but, this is what i found.  when game crashes and i validate files one file fails.  Validation fixes it and when it crashes again same file fails.  I personally can continue on like this but when it happens every 4-5 turns it gets a little annoying.","January 10, 2015","true","70.3"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","11","14","0","1"

It was buy three games for £10 and after ages of searching for three games i was interested in i bought them and i have to say it was one of the best purchases i have made in a while. (Especially after seeing it's price on here.)\n\nNow this game doesn't exactly look (graphics wise) that brilliant- especially when comparing it to some games these days, but i think that can be excused. As this game is excellent. I have only put in 9 or 10 hours so far, but those 9 or 10 hours have been both brilliant and frustrating.\n\nMy first game (after the tutorial) was fantastic. I was against two easy opponents, but i walked all over them and i had so much fun doing so. My second game i picked a map that was way to small for all 5 of us and as such we soon ran out of room and were all arguing with each other and i probably would have got destroyed if i didn't sorta rage-quit. xD My third game has gone a bit better, but i am still not exactly "Top of the food chain" so to speak and i can totally forsee a long and exciting game ahead of me.\n\nThe factions are interesting and quite varied and you can make your own too, which is pretty cool. The heroes are also cool and often amongst the most powerful units in the game and i rather enjoyed making my own hero too- though again they don't look brilliant. The monsters.....sometimes don't look great, but that's not too important really. And can often be excused when your getting destroyed by them or if your good and actually beating them. I love the quests that pop up on the map and give me fun things to do. I've got some seriously powerful units from some of these quests. And i really love the building aspect in the cities. It's simple, with a lot of choice (when it's all researched) though i do feel there could be a lot more base units in the game, but then you can also design your own too, so there could be if you had the time to make them. And i rather like the battle system as well.\n\nSo i would totally recommend this game to everyone. :) (Though perhaps not at full price.)","March 1, 2015","true","12.4"," 13 of 18 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","13","18","0","0"

I placed a lot of hope in Fallen Enchantress, as I saw many positive reviews on forums and gaming sites. The game itself is quite frankly...average. Or even below average.\nThe system itself is good and fun, lot of items to loot, monsters to kill, researches to do, empires to dominate. When you add mods it is even better. The sad part, and what makes this game almost "♥♥♥♥♥♥" is that it is so bugged, that it makes it sometimes unplayable (for a lot of people, just check official forum support page). The games crashes a lot, there is some kind of problem with memory leaks. The grid on tactical map is almost invisible so it is hard to tell where your troops can move. Sometimes the turn doesn't want to end, and only way is to reset the whole game. What is shamefull, is that mods from players are much better than the "Vanilla" game itself. It pisses me off, to see "another dlc" every month, when they can't even fix basic problem with game (bugs, crashes and incredible bad game optimisation).\nIn my opinion, the game itself is not worth the money.

There is a really cool quest and treasure system you can use to get experience for your heros. There are even raid type areas you can go into for bonus loot and there are plenty of ledgendary items your heros can loot.\n\nnow the negatives, if you play for lets say more than 5 hours in a game in total all the quests dissapere and all the special areas dry up and it hard to level your heros without declaring war which inevitably due to you having most probably 1 or more dragon and several troll and ogre units with heros geared and level beyond god status you will wipe out the enemy 1 city at a time every time very easily with no contest.\n\nThe diplomatic element in the game is pretty much non existant. if you are more powerful than the enemy they will pay you to leave them alone and vice versa. there is no other end game plan as far a diplomatic ai is concerned.\n\nmy gripe is end game play is a massive black hole that doesnt even seem to really exist, once you have power and massive arimie there is no reason to play the game you cant5 even quest for fun, if they had more diplomacy options the game whold have lasted longer.\n\nSome times a game will get bugged and crash to desktop every few turns no matter how much you reload it. that contributes to lack of desire to finish a game after a few hours of play. The roaming monster mechanics can be a real pain as a massive all powerful elemental torments your realm and is immune to damage until you get more powerful items, this is a flaw in the gamplay and should not happen as it is massivly unfair as the start of the game is a massive land grab even the very large maps are quite smalland there is no place to go except wrestle with a beast you cannot kill that keep rampaging through your settlements.\n\nhaving said all that it is still a fun and interesting game with colourful elements you cant find anywhere. its incredibly immersive and has a real D&D feel to it. If you bought it it would keep you interested for quite some time. But as i mentioned before it hasnt been built to reach a deffinitive apex and your advanced games will simply be logged out of and never played on again. so potentially it has lifespan on an epic scale but your games will nevrr achieve these levels and its sort of frustrating leaving epic loot and god heros simply because there is no more game left.","November 7, 2014","true","60.9"," 29 of 48 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","29","48","0","0"

Even the old "Master of Magic" is better than this game and the AI is worse than the AI from "Civilization 1".\nOh and external registration required... Don't forget to uncheck the 'spam e-mail' from them.\nIt's just a bad attempt at their 'sequel' of "Master of Magic" that failed completely. But you can buy their fairly expensive DLC's that will vaguely remind you of the Tropico DLC's in terms of 'price to content ratio'.\n\nThe music is extremely terrible, the sound effects seem like they are 20 years old. Ambient sounds are hardly present, if at all and the graphics are... barely doable.\n\nYou can't start a city wherever you want, you must do so on predefined locations. That is a serious limitation for me.\n\nMoving units on the world map can be a bit slow (the game needs to calculate the pathing or something). Even with low settings and a fast PC, I can't get it improved at all even though all my cpu's and videocard and such are only running at like 20%. There is something really wrong with this engine.\n\nThe GUI is very unresponsive and if you are too fast (like you return to the main menu while the game was about to show you a level-up menu or something) the game gets permanently stuck.\n\nThe AI may randomly invade you with pioneers (settlers) that destroy your improvements.\nThe AI may ignore neutral monsters and plays a different game than you. They won't be attacked as often (or not at all). According to the devs this is a bug that they are investigating... Pretty serious if you ask me.\nThe AI is just stupid in general and can not even remotely be called 'intelligent'. It's artificial and that's it.\n\nAnd the AI just goes like all ICS (infinite city&outpost spam) on you:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com//sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=370797541\nYeah they put a pioneer in every single spot they can get even if it's totally useless... Frustrating over 9000.\nEither go in perma war and kill their pioneers before they start a city/outpost, or fill all the gaps yourself. But unlike the AI, YOU have to defend your cities/outposts from neutral monsters, they don't.\n\nThis company should at least have bought an existing engine if they can't create their own and those graphics and music and sfx... It seems as if they had no budget for this game at all.\n\nOh and did I mention the random crashes? Even on streams and Youtube I often see people saving, not because they fear the battle but because they fear that the game might crash.\n\nI can't find a single reason to buy this game.

I bought it without having played the previous installments, and I find it awesome. I have tried several of the latest fantasy 4X games in the spirit of Master of Magic (Age of Wonders III, Warlock: Master of the Arcane) and this one is by far the best IMHO.\n\nThe balance between strategy, city development, hero development, tactical combat and adventure/RPG events is just right. The magic is great. The tactical combat is good - not as deep as in AOW3, but more than enough in my book. Very similar to that in Master of Magic. The variety in sovereigns and the possibilities for roleplaying ensure replayability.\n\nBut the best feature is that you can create your own units! Instead of having only a predefined range of units, you get some guys, give them a particular weapon, armor, mount, special boni and characteristics, art, etc. and you design your own kind of troop - of course the more powerful you make it, the more it will cost to actually build one. I spent hours fiddling with the unit builder alone.\n\nThe AI has been criticized, maybe it's not the best but to be honest I don't see the difference with other complex 4X games. Even in an universally appraised franchise like Civ games, the AI is just not that intelligent and higher difficulty levels work by cheating, giving the AI boni and knowledge that the player doesn't have access to (those nuclears that always went to your only city without SDI in Civ 2, lol). I suppose adding extra elements like magic doesn't help with making human-like AIs - the AI in Master of Magic was notorious for doing really dumb things and cheating a lot, even more so than in Civ, and all of us that are old enough to have played that in its time had a great time with it. I'm having a great time with this one too, and to be honest the AI didn't catch my attention for being bad at all, I only learned people had a problem with it by reading reviews. Maybe it was worse in previous versions and they have improved it over time, as I bought the game when the latest version was already 1.7.\n\nMy only gripe with this game is that it doesn't have a hall of fame: even though it gives you a score and a rank, it doesn't keep track of your best scores... it's a somewhat dumb thing to care about, I know, but I'm competitive and seeing my best scores and trying to beat them motivates me a lot. The developers said they are going to add this feature eventually, I hope they do.\n\nBut in summary, great game, lots of good content and many hours of fun in it. I think it's very underrated and it's a pity that such a gem is not better known, that's why I have decided to write this.","January 11, 2015","true","66.6"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

Awesome game with a lot of backstory. I tried it during the free weekend, bough it and been playing since. I just wish they threw in a campaign mode like. Age of Wonders so you can bring your leader through it leveling all the time. Starting up new games on like my 4th I finally got the lvl 15 acheivement, but even there I'm only a quarter threw magi abilities. I wanna keep leveling the same character. Also the game sorely lacks anything to do with water.(I mean besides water magic) Are boats that hard? Couldn't the undead just walk? Why won't my dragon actually fly so he could go over mountains and such? Other than some minor quips here a crash or two there, I'd highly recommend this to fans of either civilizations, HOMM, or even Age of Wonders though this falls short of that game by a bit. Even they had catapults and giant spiders taking up like 2-4 slots; meanwhile, my 100x the size of me dragons take up one slot :p\n\nBest part is you can completely customize the factions and leaders to your liking.

To be honest, I'm somewhere around the middle. I almost certainly wouldn't recommend it to someone who wants something of the depth of the Civilization games, but I would recommend it to someone who is new to the genre. I decided to go with a thumbs up rating as it's not really deserving of a thumbs down.\n\nThis is a perfectly fine game, I just feel that there's not much to it after a few games. It's great fun for those few games, but I've found it doesn't really bring much to the table and doesn't feel as randomized as it should. I played a few games and found the same events cropping up in each game and it got monotonous. It's possible that the various DLC will provide a lot more customisation and randomisation, but on paper it doesn't seem to deliver so I haven't tried.\n\nIf you're looking to recreate that Civilization or similar 4x feeling, this probably isn't the right game for it. Sure, it has elements of Civilization: build cities, explore, build armies, etc, but its lacking depth. The Fantasy setting is great and the addition of RPG elements is fine, but I found levelling and customising new heroes to be quite overwhelming on top of everything else. That, plus the research trees and hero skill trees leave a lot to be desired.\n\nIt's fun to get stuck into a game or two on this, but after that I was done with the game. If you're desperate for a 4x game get this when it's on sale.

The overall concept is solid, and it implements some brilliant improvements over similar games in places. I really want to like this game a lot more than I do.\n\nBut... (and we all knew THAT was coming)\nThe graphics are tolerable until you get to the hero units. Human models are Not Good. The clothing options feel like they must be at several inches thick in places.\nDepending on your chosen 'race', you will have resource shortfalls for a good long while. Also, heroes cost a fairly high amount of upkeep in gold... and when one is available to purchase, the game tends to not give you the option of NOT purchasing.\nThe entire backstory and current story of the game setting feels a bit bland and unrefined.\nand the tech and skill trees are... how to put this... short. on. options.\n\nOverall, while the game is not strictly BAD, it is not nearly as good as the somewhat unfinished, glitchy Civilization 4 TCMod that came before it.\nI'm still likely to play this once in a while, but it's just going to send me scuttling back to Fall from Heaven 2.

I bought Elemental back in the day and that game wasn't too good. They acknoledged that and gave me first Fallen Enchantress and this game for free. I didn't expect or ask them to do that either.\n\nNow about this game. It has certainly improved somewhat from the previous iterations, but the core problems still remain. Basically, it's trying to be a Civ type strategy game and a some sort of light RPG at the same time and fails at both because of this. For the kingdom level strategy I feel the detail level is too high. You'll have to research everything from daggers and small shields to 2-h swords and plate mail one small step at the time. There is a choice of dozens of buildings to construct in the cities, many of which should be abstracted, IMO. It's fine to equip the heroes in detail, but same detail in regular unit building bogs it down. Of course one can just use the default units so it's not the biggest problem.\n\nSpeaking of equipping heroes, how can I build a squad of longbowmen that doesn't cost money to build, but when I want to equip one of my heroes with a longbow, I have to pay for it... a lot. There's a disconnect between the startegy "layer" and RPG one there. Should be that conventional equipment for heroes is available for free as long as I have the tech for it, but enchanted equipment must be bought, found or crafted.\n\nCorrect me if I'm wrong, but I'm under impression that Stardock had bought the rights for Master of Magic, but decided to make Elemental instead. That's a shame because I think it would have been great success with but slight modernization. This game would be better if it was more like MOM. Still, I find myself playing in sessions of hour or two so it's not all bad.\n\nGetting better, but can't recommend it at least yet.

So much so that I created an entire nation in the likeness of past roleplaying experiences and all of my heroes were a part of that nation, personalized colors, banners, and all.  This aspect of the game gives it extra replayability, since each nation can have its strengths and weaknesses, along with its heroes perfections and flaws.  Combine that with the ability to build a city however you see fit, be it a fortress on the bay, a river side village tilling gold, or a forest enclave where the wisest of the sages study the elements to provide your civilization with insurmountable power, the options are endless.\n\nWhen you're not at war, your heroes can adventure across the country side fighting bandits, banshees, giants and mystical creatures, all while uncovering secrets of ages past that make your empire even more powerful.  In time as your power grows, your heroes can lead their armies into epic battles against the fiercest of dragons in the depths of boneyards teeming with the souls of the tortured, fighting to control the worlds remaining population of dragons.\n\nThe idea that you can make this game whatever you want makes it so worth while.

This game has a lot of imaginative features and it really feels like you're creating a new custom empire each time you play through a game. So if you're looking for replayability I can definitely say that this is something worth looking at. The combat for the game could be improved some. It can be challenging some games, but generally what happens is that you get enough momentum going with your army that you eventually steam roll everything, and if you manage to get a dragon you might as well stop playing because nothing is going to stop you after that, not even another dragon. Still, it can be a very challenging experience if you want it to be, and if you like games that let you imagine and create your own story then I cannot reccommend this enough.","December 20, 2013","true","130.5"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

So far, I've only played the tutorial. I'll come back and do a more complete review later, after playing more, but I wanted to get the warning out to those who (like me) don't like to have to set up seperate accounts (and the resulting junk mail) in order to play the game.\nOther reviews have compared this to Master of Magic (MOM), the Civ games, and even to Heroes of M&M. It IS most like MOM and the early Civ games. There are cities to build, and stuff to research, and armies to send out to explore and conquer. Those armies can (as with MOM) include Champions. So that is similar to Heroes 4. And there are some "quests" the completion of which is important to increase your fame. Fame is important because (as in MOM) the more famous you are the more and better champions you attract.\nCombat is turn-based on square tiles, but the tiles only affect movement. Spells and arrows can be cast/shot in any direction. and you can attack on a 45 degree angle. (Unlike the rediculous combat on the new "M&M" 10. But don't get me going on that!)\n-\nIn sumary, if you have played MOM, after a few controll adjustments, you will be able to play FE:LH. And if you miss the Halcyon days Of Microsoft (MOM, and Master of Orion 1 and 2) and 3DO (Might and Magic 1-9, and Heroes 1-4) they are available on Great old Games (GOG.com) and often go on sale for 2 or 3 bucks. They work through a DOS window so they will work on almost any modern computer.\nI think FE:LH will have some of that old magic to it. So, in spite of the whole Stardock account thing, I'm glad i bought it.\n\nUpdate: I've played through one game and it was enjoyable. And the game-play does fall somewhere between MOM and Civ II.\nIt won't ever make  a list of MY Most Favorite Games. But it is one that I will go back to from time to time. A worthwhile addition to any Strategy Gamer's collection.","February 17, 2014","true","28.9"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

I liked "Warlock - Master of the Arcane" very much and I'm still playing Civilization V which is a bit more complex to master, but still very good.\n\nI cannot say the same for Fallen Enchantress: Legendary Heroes, it simply doesn't stand out. I don't like its setting very much, don't understand game mechanics, also have difficulties reading in English (that's not necessarily a con for the game and I'm not a native English speaker but it's a downside for me anyway, given that there are no translations).\n\nSome annoyancies I found during  gameplay:\n● There are almost no weak enemies since the beginning, while you ARE weak and there's not much to do.\n● If you want to have any chance to win a fight you have to regroup several unit in a single one and move them as one too: so, again, at the beginning of each game you are left with 1 unit to control and that's it.\n● Auto resolve fights should not exist, it simply removes all of the fun (combat) even if you can avoid it.\n● Ending a turn doesn't do what I usually expect: e.g. moving my units when they have to cover multiple squares. Again, maybe it's me but I have to keep clicking on "End Turn" several times or nothing happens.\n\nI appreciate the help system in games and tutorials most of all but it's not the case with FE: LE. Tutorial is useless, does tell you how to move units, build things and train other units in the city but I 'd really like to know, how do I play this game? What have I to do? Just wondering with my weak unit, waiting for the city to produce something useful?\n\nLast and probably worse con: you need a Stardock account to play (this game is not even MP) and the only way to find out about that, is reading reviews, because Steam Store's page doesn't show it as an additional DRM, it's just mentioned under System Requirements (easy to miss).\n\nI had a very bad time playing this, can't and won't recommend.

It's a welcome change of pace from traditional worlds and strategy games that we've become all too familiar with. Sure, it's cool playing as Nobunaga in the next "Conquer Japan" strategy game... and it's fun playing around in the Civilization series. But what I love about Fallen Enchantress is that it's a fresh world with unique characters that we don't know anything about right off the bat. The game has it's own unique flavor and the ability to customize many aspects of the game to your liking. All of these are fantastic aspects to this game. However, it is not without some understandable criticism.\n\nWhile it appears simple, it is a game you can easily get frustrated with. Sometimes straight up bad luck can screw players from the get-go. This can even begin with just where you start on a map in a new scenario game. You can be blessed with starting in a very sound strategic location... or you can start in an area where expansion can be a total nightmare (for example, between an ocean, 20 tiles of barren wasteland and no resources and a bunch of monster bases that can easily crush starting players). This is a common criticism I have with other strategy games due to this common pitfall (from a design standpoint) is when too many things are influenced by luck (or sheer randomness, to be precise).\n\nStrategy games should be about tactics, placement and preparation. And Fallen Enchantress rewards it and punishes those that just blunder about randomly. Which is great. In that way, it's a strategy game. However, it can also feel like you are rewarded (or punished, more likely) on the roll of the dice. In *that* way, it's an unpredictable strategy game -- which can sometimes be fun and sometimes just be annoying.\n\nIn the end, though... would I recommend Fallen Enchantress? Yes. It's a gem in its own right. I'd also recommend getting it on a deal, as I did.","February 25","true","111.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It has a few bugs and minor issues but the over all game play makes up for this and it's a decent game not perfect but most players will get replay-ability from it. To describe this game I would say it has the maps, city building and research tree of the Civilization series mixed with rpg style combat, character heroes, partying system, quests and items from Heroes of Might and Magic. There's not really a campaign or story it's more like Civilization in the sense each game is on a randomly generated world and  the whole idea is to build a faction and expand like most games you have military, economic and diplomatic victory goals. On top of the Civilization style game play you create armies led by hero units and you can go around the game world doing quests to generate fame and win items for your heros. To be honest the quests are pretty grindy but the combat ones will test you and your party.\n\nAll hero units can have items, classes and upgrade like you would in a normal rpg game. It's quite nice to be able to create your own armies and actually have roles. Combat can either be automated or you can jump into the encounter and use individual skills of your heroes adding an extra edge to things. The AI on EASY is no challenge but harder difficulties will be enough for most players. Fallen Enchantress is a couple of years old but the graphics, sound and game play are decent enough that it can compete with a lot of rts and rpg games. If you want an in depth strategy game but hate hours and hours of micro management then this may be a game you'll enjoy. There aren't many other rts games that give you this level of control over your units and armies.\n\nIf you are thinking of getting all the extras then I would recommend that you only buy the QUEST ADDON from Steam and use Nexus Mods and download "Children of the Storm" for free\nhttp://www.nexusmods.com/fallenenchantress/mods/1850/?\n\nThis will give you just as much content as the paid addons and it supports the latest version of the game.\n\nThe only real bugs I've found are the game could do with being optimized a bit more as I get the odd framerate drop on the world map sometimes and those who want action all the time may get bored in the slow periods.","April 14","true","16.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Do you like RPG's? This is basically Civ where you can level up your leader like an RPG character, give them gear and talents, and let them go forth and do your bidding. Also there's questing, recruiting magical creatures or other heroes.\n\nYou control various cities with an area of influence around them, and deal with managing cities by building structures, focusing on what the city produces, and doing research, as well as controlling natural resources on the map. There are wandering monsters (Think Barbarians in Civ) that pop up from time to time and they may attack a city if they are close enough.\n\nYou can build armies of general sorts of units, but even this has flavor because you're not just designing them and naming them, you pick the equipment and gear they use, and you do have the ability to auto-upgrade existing units to whatever the newest armor/weapons that your research has unlocked, provided you have the resources.\n\nThe real fun comes from heroes, who either are recruited during certain quests or random events, or seek you out to join you when you have accomplished enough to gain enough fame. Your Sovreign (your faction's leader) is a hero with talent trees with plenty of choices, spells, and gear just like any good RPG. They can be skilled up to be good at managing a city, good at leading an army, or good fighters in and of themselves (or anything in between really). The same goes for other heroes you come across.\n\nThere is diplomacy with other empires but for the most part you're flying solo and trying to win on your own. There are numerous victory options, and most mirror the ones you'd find in Civ.\n\nThe random events and quests are varied and interesting, and the randomly generated maps lead to a lot of replayability.\n\nThe weakest aspects of the game are the city building (which, while it has depth, is nowhere near what you'd find in a dedicated city building game), the RPG aspects (while there's a lot to do and the random events are good, eventually you'll get some repeats after you've played a bunch of games). They are both pretty well done but not great - it is better than average at both but exceptional at neither. Additionally, there's not really ANY story or campaign mode. You have scenarios, but this is largely a sandbox with a randomly generated map and any story is going to be what you personally make of it via the random events that happen.\n\nHOWEVER: This game supports mod tools and user-created races, maps, items, quests, etc. Any variety the game lacks out of the box goes away if you poke around the official forums for a bit and find something that changes things you dislike (or make your own).\n\nIn sum, this game is quite enjoyable and I find myself equally drawn in by both the empire building and RPG aspects of it. Neither aspect is 100% perfect, but the games can be long (especially if you play on enormous maps with lots of AI as I tend to), and if I get bored with the RPG aspect for a bit, I'll spend time focusing on just my cities for a bit. The game lets me play it however I want and never forces me to do anything, and there's enough to do that I consistently go back to it.\n\nIt's been out for awhile now and you can probably pick it up at a decent price. The DLC is fine - it's not must-have and it's not a waste of money. It's mostly small things - new heroes, new quests, new items, which all randomly pop up in your game. The game is fun with them, but nothing stands out as  absolute must-haves. Get the DLC if you get the game and enjoy it and want more of it, or if you get the game bundled with it at a decent price.","July 14, 2013","true","39.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

What do all those numbers, statuts, data, do ? Just a tiny description. Nothing is told about long-term strategy... in a strategy game.\n\nWhat about the lore ? Since it's fantasy, it's must be important, right ? Not here. The story is so cliche, the factions are so cliches and nothing is really polished. Everything you find/read about lore will make you say "meh, classic". I'm not about what's typical, but it's not even linked in a good way. Just a bunch of random typical stuff. And nothing is really used in the game anyway. You can totally skip it and you will miss nothing of the game (for those who may ask, I consider lore in assassin's creed, total war or dark souls important, so you have my point of view).\n\nAnd here comes my main complain : this game has no identity at all. I felt like playing a mod where the creator just replaced everything with fantasy elements. If it were a mod, it would be good enough. But it's not a mod. There is a hole team behind it. If it were a film, it would be one of those stupid fantasy films pre-LotR made by people who understand nothing about fantasy, but did it anyway because "it's fantasy.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MistahBoweh/recommended/228260/","MistahBoweh","MistahBoweh","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MistahBoweh/","316 products in account","This game has some advantages and disadvantages to a similar title with a lot more polish: Endless Legends. I thought I'd compare the two.\n\nAdvantages to Fallen Enchantress:\n\n+ You can rotate the map, which is nice in tactical mode (during battles).\n\n+ The quests you get have less variety compared to Endless Legends, but in Enchantress they invariably involve combat of some kind, which is good for people who like combat. Also, there are sometimes branching paths in quests, a concept pretty much unheard of in Endless.\n\n+ The fantasy setting is great if you like that kind of thing. I do, and it's the biggest reason to like this game imho. Endless Legends has this strange cyberpunk/fantasy hybrid thing going on which rarely makes sense.\n\n+ Huge customization. You can create your empire or kingdom from scratch, rather than the civ standby of picking from the list of pre-made leaders. You can pick and choose bonuses (and penalties) to fit your playstyle, as well as having full control over the color palette that will appear on your units and cities. While equipping units is done in Endless Legends as well as Fallen Enchantress, Enchantress has a tad more variety in the early game and also has the advantage that your units change their appearance with their gear, a feature Endless lacks.\n\nDisadvantages to Fallen Enchantress:\n\n- The maps. City placement is restricted to fixed locations, and battles play out in an instanced flat plane with no variety. In Endless Legends you can build wherever the hell you want like a normal civ game and when two stacks of units fight, the overall game pauses and the units spread out into the surrounding tiles, to duke it out for six rounds. This means that units are affected by terrain and elevation, and it also means battles can be stalemates or attrition fights rather than the forced fight to the death in Enchantress.\n\n- Diplomacy is wonkier than Civ. When I played, I regularly had enemy civs offer me money out of the blue. There's a demand tribute button on the diplomacy screen, but there's also a give tribute button which will automagically give the recieving player 10% of your gold income for 30 turns. If your arbitrary point total (if you played any recent Civ game you know what I mean) is above a certain point, your opponents will shower you in gifst in the hope that you attack them last. It's funny at first, until you realize that ten percent of their income is almost always nothing and it's a completely hollow gesture in the first place. If you accept tribute from them, it gives the other civ a negative diplomacy moodlet becaude 'you demanded tribute from them'. Which, ironically, makes them more afraid you'll attack them and more likely to give tribute in the future. Also worth noting is treaties and trade are separate options in this game and that treaties must be picked one at a time, so you can't do things like sign borders agreements or take cities in exchange for peace. You either mutually accept peace (with a possible bribe in gold if needed), or you surrender everything and quit the game. There is no other way to end a war prematurely.\n\n- No navy. The sea (and air) are sorely lacking in Fallen Enchantress. Any lakes you encounter (and you will) are impassible voids. This is a shame, because a heavy focus into earth magic (if you're lucky enough to randomly generate a champion unit that knows some) eventually nets you the ability to terraform the land around you. You can turn sea into land, land into settleable land or hills, hills to mountains and vice versa. The problem is that, as mentioned, terrain has no impact on combat and cities don't work neighboring tiles, so there's very little motivation to actually do this.\n\n- The minimalistic approach. Numbers in this game are very small. You'll spend ten turns on a building that nets you +1 science per turn. Every customization option in this game, from making units to leveling champions to constructing buildings to upgrading them to using spells in or out of combat to making your empire in the first place, all of them are minimalistic tweaks. Despite all the options you have, none of it actually does much of anything. You might see a building that generates double the science that your city already produced, until you realize you built every science building available and you're only producing seven, and that building replaces another one which already increased your science output by 75% so instead of netting +7 science for your twenty turns of production, you're actually only getting +1. Your units will get damage buffs of 10 to 20 percent at a time, but that translates into 1-2 extra damage on your attack, which won't make a difference to the vast majority of enemies. Whenther they had the buff or not it'll still take the same amout of attacks, same number of turns in combat, to kill anything. The result is that the game feels very hollow, where it looks on the surface like there's a lot of replay value but there actually isn't. Seeing as replay value is the ultimate goal for a 4x game, this is a serious shortcoming.\n\nSummary:\n\nIf you just rewatched Game of Thrones and you REALLY want to play a Civ game that uses a fantasy setting and magic and whatnot, if you want to play dress-up with your units and if you really don't care if the game is actually any good, you might as well play Fallen Enchantress. But if what you're looking for is a 4x game with any level of depth, a game that will entertain you for more than a few hours and a game where your choices have a drastic impact on the flow of the game, go for Endless Legends.\n\nOh, and Legends has multiplayer, for the people who care about that.","January 4, 2015","false","16.6"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

As we all know by now, Elementa: War of Magic arrived in a pretty bad state and never recovered from its severe design deficiencies.  Stardock, being Stardock, refused to abandon their dream of a great new 4X fantasy game and released a stand-alone expansion, Fallen Enchantress, that tried to rectify what went wrong with the first game by cutting out lots of features of the original that just didn't work, and by enhancing what was left.  When all was said and done, while Fallen Enchantress was a marked improvement over EWoM, it still struck me as a mediocre game.\n\nWhen Legendary Heroes was added to my account (I was one of those who were 'comped' with two free expansions) , I was not in any rush to try it.  I mean, seeing how FE was still nothing that great, I figured LH was going to be just another incremental improvement on the base game.\n\nI WAS WRONG!\n\nLegendary Heroes has completely amazed me with its gameplay (especially with the recent 1.4 patch).  Finally, we have an Elemental game that lives up to the hopes and dreams we all had when Elemental was first announced!  This is now a fantastic fantasy-based 4X experience with lots of faction/hero customization options that really adds a great RPG element, as well as a smart implementation of the core 4X (explore, expand, exploit, and exterminate) gameplay dynamic.  The tactial battles, which were a bit bland before, are now fun and challenging endeavors (the tactical AI is very good!).  City building, which was also rather boring in the previous iterations of the series, has received a lot of love, amking it a quite enjoyable to watch your cities grow.  Questing has also received some nice attention, making for some interesting one-off battles.  Add in some "game changing" random events (something Stardock is known for), and you now have a very addictive, very polished experienced.\n\nStardock has also just begun releasing DLC for the game.  While I have only purchased the Quest DLC so far - it seems to offer the most bang for the buck at the moment - I suspect we can expect a lot more that should really enhance the game even more.\n\nLastly, this being a proper PC game, there are some great mods already available.\n\nLong short: Legendary Heroes is a very good 4X fantasy game that is well worth your gaming dollar.  I don't think it is too much of a stretch to say that with some more DLC and/or an expansion, Legendary Heroes could well match the revered status of Stardock's sci-fi  magnum opus, Galactic Civilizations II.","October 26, 2013","true","24.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It does offer a little fun, but barely enough for even the sale price of $9.99 to feel worth it (and certainly not for full price). I'll elaborate in greater detail below.\n\nThis review is based upon my time playing the game during this free-to-play weekend, though I previously played over 100 hours (not on steam) in Elemental and also tried out the free copy of the first FE Stardock gave me (but it didn't keep my interest very long at all).\n\nHere is a list of my main frustrations:\n-For a game called "Legendary Heroes", you barely get any heroes to play with;\n\n-Even worse, the leveling system for the heroes you do get doesn't do them any justice;\n\n-Creation of custom Sovereigns and Races sounds cool, but the choices are very few and really offer little strategic/tactical impact;\n\n-This is also true for creating custom troops - equipment choices in particular are painfully limited and mostly irrelevant;\n-Consequently, tactical battles lack any real depth - not to mention the many other issues with them (no troop placement phase, inconsistent battle map sizes, etc);\n\n-Overall, these frustrations result in a negative gameplay experience for me, to the point where even the interesting environments, quests to complete, and wild monsters to fight just cannot keep me invested in playing. I love the concepts so very much, but their implementation kills the potential fun.\n\nRead on for a more detailed look at these issues:\n\nNot Enough Heroes\nYou can only recruit a new hero when you reach certain levels of "fame", which you get from completing quests from random locations spawned on the map. Each new level requires even more fame, such that in my 12 hours of free playing I had only gotten a mere 2 heroes. This is simply unacceptable for a game called "Legendary Heroes" and it seriously undermines the RPG aspect of play. Furthermore, when you unlock a new hero you are only offered a choice between 2 candidates. The first time, both were at level 1, which meant I got to choose my first hero's class when she reached level 2 (I went with Defender, as my Sovereign was a Warlock); but when I finally unlocked my second choice of heroes, both candidates were past level 2, meaning that I was stuck with the classes already assigned to them (either another Defender or another Warlock...while I wanted to pick another class I didn't have yet). This was extremely frustrating and not at all fun.\n\nHero Leveling is a Disappointment\nEvery time a hero gains a level, they get 1 point to spend on a new perk (including passive buffs and active abilities). All heroes have a few General perks available, while the majority are based on their class (Defender, Assassin, etc). The first problem is that 1 skill point per level is not enough to give you a decent selection. Want them to unlock the next 3 spells in the type of magic they know? There goes your point. Want them to learn first aid? Their goes your point. And levels require a lot of fighting to get.\n\nLimited skill points wouldn't be so bad if the perks actually made a big difference, but most of them don't. For my Defender, some perks added only +5 HP (or the like), while a few offered new combat moves. Sadly, the layout of the skill tree meant I needed to pick many lame perks before reaching the ones that actually sounded useful, so in my 12 hours of play I never unlocked any cool ones for my heroes. I realize the devs may not want heroes to be overpowered (although there are so few of them in numbers that I feel they almost *should* be a bit OP), but you can do that by giving a level progression to the cool abilities so they start off weak and can be improved with further perks, not by making it very slow and frustrating to even unlock the abilities at all. Anyway, the leveling system is very frustrating and kills the fun for me.\n\nCustom Sovereign/Faction/Unit Creation is Shallow\nCustomization is one of my favorite aspects in a game, in both the practical and aesthetic senses (custom ship design from Gal Civ II is a great example). This game appears to offer these features, but once you dig in they are really very shallow. While there are nuances between the 3 types of custom creation, all three share the same flaws: too few deign points, too few design options (in particular for "weaknesses" that let you take a hit in one area to gain more design points to enhance another area), and the options they do have ultimately don't create a different feeling or play-style. This undermines not only the RPG aspect of the game, but also replayability (since no faction can really get that substantively different from another). I could go much more deeply into the details and nuances of/between types of customization, but in the end I still find each kind limiting and strategically/tactically unfulfilling. It's very disappointing and undercuts my motivation for playing the game.\n\nPoor Tactical Battles\nEven by the most simple standards for a tactical battle system, the game comes up short. There are few weapons to choose from for your units (on top of their already shallow customization), and the attempt to make each class of weapon have more uniqueness fails. Giving some armor penetration to spears and a knockdown chance to hammers doesn't cut it. It makes designing units really boring, and tactical combat boring and repetitive as well. Ultimately, it just comes down to attack and defense values to decide the outcome, plus just not being stupid by letting the enemy gang up on your units (while you try to gang up on theirs). Also, having a maximum army size of just 9 units really limits not only the tactical possibilities (for example, I don't have enough units to, say, shield my custom Race's unmatched archers behind a line of heavy pikemen, nor does the customization system let me even make the Race of unmatched archers...), but also the sense of epic scale - you only ever fight skirmish-sized battles or send your small party against one super monster and its several minions. Anyway, the battles lose their appeal very quickly.\n\nConclusion\nThe above frustrations are what ruin my playing experience for FE:LH; hence, I cannot recommend it. There are even other issues I didn't touch on (like the tech tree structure, etc) that I could maybe forgive on their own, but for a game called Legendary Heroes these key flaws regarding heroes/customization/battles are simply too much. Even though I will somewhat miss the match I sank 12 hours into during this free-to-play weekend, it's not even worth $9.99 to me to get the game and continue playing what I started. Sadly, I know that continuing it would entail more frustration with the game design than fun.\n\nIf you care more about other aspects of the game, maybe you will still like it; but since many people (like me) might want to buy this because of the elements that are lacking (the promise of customization, RPG aspcets, battles), I want to call out those elements as I see them.\n","January 4, 2015","false","13.0"," 10 of 18 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","10","18","0","0"

The fighting is boring with a predictable AI and terrain that has no advantage in battle. I was so underwelmed from the fighting that I ended up hitting the automated attack button. The most action I got out of this game was hitting the End Turn button to speed up building.\n\nNo city design controll.\nPerhaps this next issue won't bother you, but it irritated me to no end. You cannot place the items in your town were you would liek them to go. You just hit the develop button and then order the items you want made first.\n\nUI is unfriendly\nThis section is to complain about how unfriendly the controll are in this game. Although mastery of the UI is not hard, it does not feel natural. A few more easy to use button would have made a large differnce as well as a few windows. For instance, I would have like a better way to form war parties instead of clicking on the town, then the soldier, then a blank square outside the city, and then finally repeat for each other soldier I want in the group making sure to have them join the same square outside of town. Even if it only took a couple of minutes, that is time further waisted through uneeded tedium.\n\nMy final adivce\nThere are better browser 4x games for free out there.

How about Heroes of Might and Magic?  Think of this game as their 'not the sharpest knife in the drawer' child.\n\nFallen Enchantress: Legendary Heroes tries to be a game of both City-Building and Turn-Based-Combat. Unfortunately it does both of these in wonderful mediocrity.  Neither aspect of the game is fleshed out fully and this leaves you somewhat unsatisfied in both arenas.\n\nThat being said, the game is not without merit. While it's not as deep as other games, it's a decent way to scratch your TBS itch. The character models are decent and the inclusion of a fantasy setting makes the city-building interesting when starting out. The game isn't worth the asking price of $40, but if you see it on sale for $10 or less, it's probably worth your time if you're a fan of Civilization and TBS games.","February 25, 2014","true","16.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It still has a bug every now and then but nothing that hurts the experience for me. My favorite part about it is being able to create your own factions and heroes (backstories and all) and play them. There is definitely a bit of a learning curve, but it's a fun learning curve. I've put quite a few hours in and I feel like I've barely scratched the surface of how many different strategic options there are. One of the major aspects that I love about this game is that it's not just a numbers game. Some games like this, for example Might and Magic VI, have a lot of strategic depth, but in the end it just becomes a numbers game as to who has the bigger army. This game does a really good job of balancing that out by limiting the size of each army, so you have to be more picky about what types of units make up your army, sort of like a mix between XCOM: Enemy Unknown and Might and Magic VI.","January 17, 2014","true","80.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Firstly you start out with a hero.  This hero can choose from one of five tech trees, and each tech tree has around 3 paths, with only 1 you will be able to max out, so lots of deferent playthroughs  in the combat if you change your hero.\n\nIn Civ you can get bored when you are building stuff, but in this world it has NPS, monsters that roam, quests, loot to find, epic monsters.  So you take your hero out to level up.\n\nSo if I take my hero and 2 mages.  We all get xp if we survive a battle.  The mage can level up and also I can custom creat units which is epic.  With this you can make mages wear plate armour if you fancy it.  It really is epic.\n\nThe more you do in the world your fame will increase and you'll get other hereos to help you.\n\nAll in all... A BLAST... I played 24 hours straight, playing as the Necomancer Mage in a Large classic map.  Also dipped into the scenerio which is a story line verson of the game, teachign you about the npc and monsters you will find in classic mode.\n\nI'll give this 100% as it is such an iteration of CIV in a fantasy world.  If CIV VI takes this approach it would be great, but otherwise this game has it cooking and it tastes great.

It's got all the makings of a classic tactics game.  You'll level up your main hero (or sovereign) and your individual champions, research new spells, complete quests, find new equipment with special abilities, etc.  All the while, you'll be expanding your empire/kingdom a la Civilization style.  If that sounds awesome, that's cause it is!\n\nOn top of all of that, it has an extensive map/faction editor, and it even lets you design your own "sovereign", which is surprisingly detailed for a game like this.\n\nI've actually been sitting on this game since May of 2013, and I can't believe it's taken me this long to play the damn thing.  I'd strongly encourage everyone out there to give this a whirl.  I know the price tag is a bit daunting considering you've probably never heard of the game, but trust me when I say it's worth it.  If not now, wait until one of the holiday sales.

There is a LOT to learn.\n\nLike most 4x games, it is a bit overwhelming at first, but it quickly grows on you and you settle in to get your empire up and running.\n\nThere is a lot of challenge to be found in both the early and later game stages. Monsters roam the land and they range very widely in power between pushovers and godlike. Especially so for your weak early armies and champions. Knowing when to leave a challnge or quest for later is critical in keeping your troops and heroes safe.\n\nThe AI is also actually decently competent. I lost one of my cities easily early on and got routed in my bid to take over an enemy city a few times.\n\nThe strategic battles are one of my favorite parts of the game. You can easily lose a battle even with an overwhelming force if you make bad choices. It is a much better system than the static system of games like Civ 5 and Warlock: Master of the Arcane. You actually fight battles on a tactical map where positioning and ability use are important.\n\nMy only real gripe is that diplomacy is a lot less developed than some other 4x games. Hopefully the developers will improve on that in future updates.\n\nA solid and fun game overall if you are a fan of 4x games.","January 5, 2014","true","129.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If it doesn't blow your mind you have no soul. And you can reate basically your own faction in game although it is quite exploitative after you know the mechanics (and it doesn't take long to know them, especially if you have played Civ games already)\n\nBesides, Kael from FFH2 worked on it, although I would recommend Civ IV with FFH2 and other modmods over this game, FE is going to suck a lot of hours from your life guaranteed.

A grand turn-based strategy game, comparable to Civilization IV but in a gorgeous high-fantasy setting with tactical battles and RPG elements. Most significantly for me, it is fully customisable: design your own faction, leader and units to suit your personal playstyle and role-play. Longer games have stability issues, but I fixed mine by turning off anti-aliasing. 8/10\n\nStory: It may be misleading to speak of story in a game like this, and I have not yet played the campaign scenario. The premise of the world, elaborated here from previous Elemental games, is interesting enough. And the customisation allows you to create your own story as you please. 6/10\n\nGameplay:  Despite some AI and balance issues, the gameplay is solid and very engaging. It’s not long before that classic Civilization “one more turn” syndrome sets in and takes over, and single games can easily steal away 20-30 hours. Though the fashion in 4x strategy is towards hexagons, square-based maps do the job here, and it is fun to explore rich landscapes dense with monsters, treasure and quests to fulfill. City and resource management are interesting, and it’s satisfying to see your metropolises grow and your empire expand. Research is broken into three tech trees (Civic, Warfare, Magic) you advance separately, making it a strategic choice of where your focus will be. Tactical battles are fun, if a bit on the simple side; tactics emerge solely from your unit design and the composition of your armies, without regard for other factors such as terrain. Auto-resolve can be a bit wonky, and can sometimes beat otherwise unwinnable battles, but it is not game-breaking. The UI is a masterpiece and provides all the information you need to manage your empire. Detailed faction and unit customisation are what tie all these factors together and make Fallen Enchantress a superior experience to similar 4x games.  9/10\n\nGraphics: The graphics will appear a bit dated to some, but the art style fits the unique setting nicely resulting in a somewhat cartoony, but still beautiful, dark and broken world. 7/10\n\nSound/Music: The sound is not exceptional (ambiance is decent), but the music is great with some truly epic themes to conquer to.  7/10","June 1, 2015","true","46.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There are way too many stupid bugs that should never have made it out of QA. I would be ashamed to be listed as a QA tester or QA lead for this game. Bugs such as turning off special video elements causing fire based creatures to disappear is plain stupid.  Having default trained units that have plate or chain armor perks when the FACTION can't use such armor is just plain sloppy. Units stacking on themselves in tactical combat is  lazy. Armies stacking on top of "hostile" AI units in strategic view is sloppy.\n\nThe AI is horrible. I would be ashamed to be listed as a coder for it.\n\nThe graphics artists did a really good job. The music score is well done and appropriate for the game. The low number of maps provided are nicely drawn. The side/story quests are nicely done.  The faction political/trade interface is sound. Unfortunately, these aspects of the game cannot dwarf the incompetence of the "coders" and "testers" above. This game had a very strong and good idea but was ruined by poor execution.\n\nI would rate this game far below Microprose Birth of the Federation and LucasArts Star Wars Rebellion. These two games are over a decade old.\n\nUntil they fix these issues with the core game, I will not bother with any of the expansions. I won't waste my time on any of their newer projects.

I love 4X games, and probably own most of the known ones, but this one feels like it's lacking something.\n\n**A few points:**\n\n* tons of content in this game: items, loot, weapons, spells, there's a lot of them;\n* mob variety: a lot of variety, and they scale well among all levels and all of them have a little flavor description;\n* total lack of empire management: nothing at all; no "empire plan" or "social policies" or "virtues" or anything similar to adapt your empire;\n* diplomacy is rather dull and almost useless, because every AI will eventually hate you and want to kill you because of such modifiers as "we want to establish order to the world" which makes them want to destroy you even if they are your ally. You cannot play peacefully in this game, you will be rolled over if you don't maintain a huge army at all times;\n* quests on the map: similar to Endless Legend, only way more boring and uninteresting. They have huge amount of uninteresting text. The Endless Legend ones seem a lot more compelling and they tie in to the lore of the game, not here;\n* combat is dull: there's a *swarm* mechanic, where all your adjacent units will attack an enemy, but that's about the only twist there is to it. The combat itself is not bad, and spells are actually interesting and strategic, but the presentation of the combat is dull and all units looking almost the same doesn't help either;\n* performance: surprisingly poor for the look of the game. The engine is much more optimized then it was before, I have reported the issue a long time ago and Brad, the CEO of Stardock took personal interest in fixing this, and they did, but still I get the same FPS as in Farcry 3 so this might be an issue for some people;\n* turn wait time: almost inexistent because the AI things while you take your turn and just executes the moves when you press the button;\n* late game is a nightmare: there are no governors for the cities and destroying the cities can only be done after 5 turns after it has been conquered. Also, destroying a city, leaves "fertile" ground where the AI could build another one;\n* developing cities is honestly as dull as it is in Age of Wonders 3: you choose one of three specializations: Science, Military/Production or Growth/Money and from then on you just build the specialized buildings in the same order, you can just queue them for 100 turns, it makes no difference;\n* race differentiation: very little; they all look the same, except for some DLC ones, and the only difference is in bonus stats and sometimes a unique unit or building. Nothing even remotely close to the extent of Endless Legend;\n\nThat being said, I cannot recommend this game, because there's Endless Legend and Age of Wonders 3. They're both better games for different reasons: Endless Legend for civilization building and economy and trade and diplomacy, and Age of Wonders 3 for the superb combat and unit variety and that sense of fantasy adventure.","January 2, 2015","false","18.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game can take as long as a game of Civilization V (3-5 hours) but it doesnt offer the appeal to me that Civ does, it moves a little slower and doesnt open up quite as much Civ can.  While being able to make your own units and customizing your heroic characters is interesting in concept the game doesnt really give you very much to play with because depending on your race and character class the optimal path of creation is clear and wavering from it is not worth doing.  So while I may be able to make my own character who can blow apart foes with some great magical missles it seems like 9/10 characters are going to do that anyway and I get left witih a rather repetative experience that takes hours.  To go back to the previous comparison, Civ V can recieve similar review but the amount of variation between games and the humor of making a George Washington who rules a Shinto regilious state is much more entertaining to me personally.  I also found the difficulty curve to be confusing beyond all belief.  Some games were so easy I couldnt lose if I wanted and one difficulty level up I couldnt survive more than an hour or so without being completely wiped out.\n\nOn a positive note the game does have some pretty decent AI that does seem to know how to handle all the different races equally well, no one race or hero seems to overpowerd when the computer controls them.

While the 'Heroes of Might and Magic' elements are deeply rooted with customization, the ability to custom make your king (or queen) with what skills, specialization, and even their appearance and weapon. The same can be said for your military units. As you can make them either man or woman, what their weapon is and what their armor and skills are. This though, is the stand-alone expansion which is the same game, but with the added content.\n\nPeronsally from my standpoint on this game, I've already spent about ten hours playing it and I love it. The customization is the biggest factor for me and the mods available for this title is amazing. The only negative I see is price on steam, it being $39.99, along with all the DLC being around $30 ($29.94) in price, I'd wait you either have the funds to buy or it to go on sale.\n\nRegardless, I think its an amazing title and it deserves a chance if you are into fantasy, turn-based games or city-builders.","January 6, 2015","true","51.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The amount of noise simply overwhelms the information and that is a design flaw that permeates the game. The designers simply do not understand that communication is about *meaning*, and you cannot meaningfully communicate if everything that you say is interrupted by something else, which in turn has been interrupted . Or that you drown out what is important by endlessly repeating statements about the irrelevant. Granted that these half-spoken communications eventually unwind off the stack to finally speak the rest of what they were supposed to have said, but the connection between pieces has been lost.\n\nStacked Modal dialogs that are half-statements of things interrupted is an idiotic paradigm beyond comprehension. Yet this is the paradigm that the designers of Fallen Enchantress have built into the control loop of the game.\n\nBut the basic principles of communication are not just abused in this manner.\n\nSome guy will complain that you are intruding on his territory, but not tell you where. So that intrusion could be a transient event created by an automated scout or it could actually be a meaningful complaint about an army. But you don't know which because city boundaries are often not clear. All that you know is that something has happened someplace and maybe you should do something about it if you could.\n\nSome alert will announce that there are enemies in your territory, and it has announced it for dozens of turns. But the alert is not relevant because the beasts are holed-up in their cave and still remain too strong to take on. That information then should be check-boxed and excluded from the alert, but instead it is repeated turn after turn, to the point that it is eventually ignored. Yet *all* intrusions use the same alert and so ignoring that one can leave other, more serious intrusions, ready to pounce from the bushes.\n\nTactical combat takes place in an arena that reflects the locale, and there are often building and trees in the area. This is a nice aesthetic touch and a sensible paradigm. But unfortunately, in Fallen Enchantress, those buildings and trees are fixed objects and do not become transparent when the space gains focus. That means that these objects can obscure armies and placements behind them, leaving you blind when you try to move into that space or attack enemies on it.\n\nPossible movement squares of armies are highlighted as are those of the opposing armies. Unfortunately, the base color is light blue, and the movement squares of friends is light green. Closely examined, the difference is clear, yet errors in placement are often made because those colors are transparent pastels and not easily differentiated with a quick glance. Again, clear communication was not the objective and so it doesn't take place.\n\nThere are various other problems, and others have talked about them and the poor AI in the game, but the problem is deeper than any. The problem is that the developers do not understand what they are doing. They might be competent programmers but they do not understand design and the necessary flow of communication and execution that makes working within the world they've created a pleasure. This game works, but working within it is a pain because you have to fight with it to get what you want done.\n\nBehind the mess is a game worth playing, but you'll need a fair bit of patience to reach it.\n","June 2","true","111.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

We all know our Civilizations or Dominions or Alpha Centauris, but I barely know anyone who's heard of this, let alone played it. That being said, this game could be described a rough diamond. The game has some glaring balance issues, and it's a good bit glitchy at times, but the gameplay is solid and rewarding.\n\nEvery game begins like any Civilization game, where you found your capital city and then start to explore the world. However, instead of your standard units like Civilization has, you have customized units that you can design yourself. You also have heroes, which are specialty one-man armies that will join your cause from time to time.\n\nIf you've played Age of Wonders III, the combat is remarkably similar. When you enter battle, both factions are placed on the opposite side of the battlefield, and you move them into play until they're in range to strike.\n\nThe world itself is incredibly detailed. On almost every playthrough, I'll run into a quest or monster that I've never seen before, and every game spawns one of four special areas of the map where you can fight boss-type monsters and aquire extremely rare treasure. Every game brings something new.\n\nPROS:\n\n- Incredibly varied worlds\n- Good combat system\n- Lots of "fluff"\n- Wide variety of artifacts and weapons\n- Useful character creator\n\nCONS:\n\n- Some factions just plain suck\n- Game can be glitchy, particularly when loading saves\n- Soundtrack's rather forgettable\n\nFINAL VERDICT\n\nFirst off, buying this game with all the DLC will leave you homeless.

This game could achieve many things and could be said a next best game after the HoMM 3, as I like to create Hero which can be an outstanding character. This game allows this, and give many ways of achieving victory and playing is almost endless not like in HoMM 3 (Still game is perfect for playing with friends and campaign also nice :) ) where after wining game is over and here you can still go. For me this game is connecting HoMM 3 and Civilizations which give a birth to a good child but weak. Why is that? First of all it have a very good foundation to be the best but still need much more time to be "trained" and shows the results of being completed.\n\nWhat it needs to be done to be remembered and still be playable like HoMM?\n-Perfomance ! (This game on big maps takes time, not saying about time how long is to achieve the victory, but the time between turns! After 100-150 turns time to wait is about 1-2 min to get my turn.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/NickIxo/recommended/228260/","NickIxo","Ixo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/NickIxo/","256 products in account","I really enjoyed this game. It's similar to games like Civilization or Warlocks: Master of the Arcane but the details are all heavily changed to create a very unique entry into the genre. Given how much there are to games like this, I'll just highlight things that stood out to me that I liked and didn't like.\n\nWhat I liked:\n+Each leader/faction felt significantly different from the other factions -- There's a lot of different units, spells and bonuses that each faction gets to make you get a different experience playing with each one.\n\n+The game's combat is really fun -- You can play in a top down view isometric grid type combat or auto-calc. The auto-calc is weird, so sometimes you suffer some bad losses and sometimes you win a battle you could have never won, however I found this feature to be more in my favor than ever against me and I normally only did it in situations where I would obviously win to save time. Additionally you can create very large armies with very powerful units so that a combat victory is much more feasible than in a game like Civilization.\n\n+The random stuff on the map is quite fun -- The game has a quest system which, while basic, is actually pretty fun in short bursts. Additionally there is the option to have a ton of monsters and animals to keep yourself busy with them. On top of all that there is a dedicated area on each map where a ludicrously over-powered monster reigns who you can fight for some sweet items.\n\n+The hero system is pretty fun -- At first heros seem awesome. Heroes can use spells, equip gear, have special properties that buff your army or a city they occupy. In combat they aren't useful later in game because their stats just don't scale well, but their spells/city/group buffs can be worth it. Each hero is very different so it's something to explore.\n\n+The city system is really good and has great progression -- Each city levels up and as they level you can choose a specialization for them, offering bonuses to that particular city. This is really cool and offers you a new level of customization. I found myself regularly creating 1 resource heavy city and then making several combat cities to amass a horde of overpowered soldiers.\n\nWhat I didn't like:\n-The game isn't technically perfect -- Sometimes you try to click something on the map and the game has it's own mind. Sometimes walking to a particular place is a real pain. These were fairly minimal interruptions, but over the course of 50 hours it was enough to make me complain about it. Also as mentioned earlier the auto-calcuation battles can be wonky. Sometimes I would start a fight manually, then once I realized I couldn't win, I'd auto-calc to end my suffering. However, I'd end up winning a fair amount of those battles somehow. It didn't bother me because it was a nice surprise, but it may be a break in realism for others.\n\n-There is a steep learning curve -- The game has a lot of stuff to it, much like civ. The difference is that in this game the combat is more present, so you do need to be more up to snuff. I found myself being demolished in about 3 (...practice) games before I could finally conquer others, even on easier settings. The monsters can be a real threat, which is nice later on, but at the start it can be overwhelming.\n\nIf you like any sort of strategy, please try this game. I was sad I was so hesistant in buying it (I didn't buy it until it hit $10, easily worth $40). Please note this review is based on the game without any of the DLC.","October 3, 2015","true","46.0"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

The tutorial literally has you doing taxes, and it doesn't get any better in the game proper. Also, just to start the game, you need to create and validate a Stardock account.\n\nA separate account and presumably always-online DRM. For a singleplayer-only game. What!?\n\nThe graphics are unappealing, DeviantArt amateur quality. Even the art style choice can't justify how unfinished and poorly polished everything looks, especially the characters. Aside from lacking graphical definition, the characters are also rather bland and unremarkable - this does not even feel like playing a Pretty Good hero.\n\nThe sounds are okay, but the soundscape feels really rushed. The ambiance is composed of short, irritating loops and the music starts to jar very quickly. I preferred to mute the game and just listen to my own music or podcasts while trying to slog my way through.\n\nI think that's enough bashing, the game really isn't worth your money. I only mention these things to give you some idea what I base my negative outlook on. Buyer Beware.\n\nPS. If you're looking for Fantasy 4X, you're better off replaying Heroes of Might and Magic IV (€9 on GOG.com, DRM-free).

Factions have slightly different play styles, though it's nothing drastic.

The action tends to slow down after you defeat all the lower level creatures in the area, and have to start venturing towards other players. Diplomacy was simple for me: I liked having clear answers and numerical values during trades instead of having to guess whether your diplomat is skilled enough to overcome the hatred between your nations, as seen in other 4X titles.\n\nIf you like 4X games as well as RPGs, I strongly recommend this game.

Needless to say, I wont be buying it. While im using a pentium i3 with 8gb of memory, the game ran OK, but ending a turn generally took about 10-20 seconds to process everything. You will be ending turns ALOT in this game  because everything takes forever to make.\n\nI decided to forgo the tutorial and quickly realized this was a civ style game. Unlike civ, you can only build cities on green tiles that have resources. Due to a mistake I made with my settlers by clicking the outpost button, and the inability to undo a turn I was left at a disadvantage while it took another 6 turns to produce another settler. During this time, the AI hemmed me in and I was stuck to two cities the whole game. I kept playing thinking I could research and negotiate my way out of it. Impossible.\n\nAfter researching everything I needed to earn capital quickly, I paid the most powerful player to declare war on my neighbor. This had virtually no effect as they both continued to grow more powerful. I should have known because when my neighbor declared war on me, his army consisted of two scouts and three archers and that was it. All of the AI's soldiers were garrisoned in the cities with 400+ attack power. With a limitation of 6-7 slots in an army and NO system for reinforcing one army with another it becomes impossible to dislodge them.\n\nAfter figuring out how rigid the game is, I just stopped playing.

Well, after playing through the night and finishing one random game, one thing is for sure: I'm not going to buy it after the time runs out.\n\nThis game is tedious. I started with the tutorial and, boy, were the introductory videos long and unnecessary! I got to the end of only one of them, skipping all the others, and didn't feel like I was missing something. Then there was the main game. For me it went like this: settle down, start expanding - ooh, it's getting interesting - die trying to explore, meet neighboors, avoid their units and wandering monsters while trying to explore and expand, upgrade your cities and lose your units on the way to join main guy's army - repeat for many turns until you know the map - start negotiating, get into a war, sign a peace treaty - rinse and repeat, that's where I lost the last of my interest for this game, during those many turns where nothing happened - finally be strong enough to follow the main storyline and immediately after wait again for who knows how long for new units to be trained in place of the fallen ones. Yeah, boring.\n\nI got three endings: the ultimate spell (which I did only out of curiosity, not knowing that it will end the game), by losing to the final dragon behind the gates and by killing it (last two with the use of cheats because of the difficulty jump - I could easily kill any monster or AI unit on the map but this thing obliterates me in, like, three turns? Yeah, no, I'm not grinding for that - and by the way: those cheats? Did not help much). I didn't try to conquer all the other nations just because I couldn't be bothered anymore and wanted to be done with it. And my rating was always 4/10 (I think) despite having, like, twenty fully upgraded cities and finishing all reasearch and quests.\n\nAlso, this game doesn't have window mode which incredibly bothered me and the loading process took way longer than it should. Maybe my machine isn't powerful enough, although I thought it didn't have to be to play a top-down strategy game! On the technical side of the things, thank god there is an auto-battle option, cause I don't think I would have gotten this far without it! Never played a battle on my own (except the final dragon one but that one doesn't count) and immensely grateful for that.\n\nTL;DR\n\nActually, this game is not so bad - for the first few hours. After that, if you're not a fan of the wainting game, it becomes too much. Maybe it's supposed to be played in short sessions, who knows, but for me one run was more than enough.\n\nNever would've thought of buying this game before; certain that I'd not now.","January 5, 2015","false","13.7"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

So in this review I'm going to talk myself through formulating a rating, and maybe you'll see why I am so confused by how to rate this game.\n\n- To start lets point this out. This game is HORRIBLY optimized. I averaged 40 FPS as low as 20 and I have a beast rig. But I averaged these fps on EVERY graphical setting. Max, medium, and low. Did the devs even aim for 60fps? I guess not.\n+ These graphics are good enough for me, I enjoy them. But a lot of persons today may want something better. The game was released in 2012 though. We didn't have any Witcher 3 graphics back then, remember?\n+/- The sounds were decent, but nothing to write home about.\n+ The game has a story mode with two scenarios. One is essentially a "Squad-based" campaign where you mostly use "hero" units to accomplish quests. The second plays essentially like the main "skirmish"-esque game mode plays (Which is called "new game" and that's it), except with some added story that keeps it far more interesting than the regular skirmish mode.\n- The repitition in the game is....ugh. Its the same quests over and over again. If you play "new game" first, you'll never enjoy the story mode because you've already done everything you can do in the story mode for 9 hours at least beforehand. If you do story mode first you'll never appreciate "new game"due to its lacking of the main story content that kept the scenarios interesting. The game's formula grows old after 5 hours.\n+/- The turn based combat is something unique for this game in the 4X scene. It keeps the game very interesting, an even a little hard in the beginning. Eventually you learn the perfect strategy for each map because honestly, it doesn't have many. Then it just becomes a chorse, and since auto-resolve tends to favor you anyway, you being to skip the feature entirely. It's good...but becomes bad.\n\nSo I still am lost about what to give this game. Honestly, the game has a very mediocre feel in every aspect of it. From the studio that made so many good RTS games, you'd think they'd be able to get a turn based game down pretty easily. But honestly, I'm going to have to give the game a 5/10. It was fun, eventually the repition and lack of optimization got to me. (Eventually being 5 hours in. Its amazing that I made it to nearly 20 hours). It's a very AVERAGE game with some very poor design decisions. Mostly bug-free though.\n\nSo do I recommend it? Well.....no. It was more of a chore than it was fun to play. So even if it was fun for a little bit. Well...It's really just not worth your money, ok? Please save yourself the mental headache that this game induces and just avoid it.

When I got my copy I was able to see what could be, but it was still an “alpha” game… So I let it go,  kept checking the progress and changes overtime, but nothing got my attention. Then along came 1.7 update and much of what I read I liked so I purchase Legendary Heroes.\n\nA BIG WOW!\n\nI am so happy the developers never gave up. This is very much what they had promised back when they were making the first Elemental. There is still room for improvement (lots of potential for growth and expansion), but the main concept is all there!\n\nSo, soon as  they let us make scenarios using the “workshop”,  a custom monster toolset (like the spell toolset) and add a hot seat feature to the game it will appeal to many D&D table top players like myself.\n\nI love the way the mechanics and AI  have developed and evolved/improved, I love the customization aspect so, so, so, very much. Changing gear is actually visible in game play, love the way cities can level as well as almost everything else, we just need equipment to level as well (hopes).\n\nThe artwork is splendid. I have loved the art from day one! So perfect for this kind of game, the way the story is presented through text and that unique artwork makes me feel like I am actually reading a D&D campaign and I can get my fiends involved (rolling dice to make decisions, character customization, etc.) we played all night as if we were playing table top, and we never once looked at the time, it was great fun, different, but not so different that it did not work. It is thanks to the freedom to customize just about everything that makes this game so rewarding and usable as a tool for a good old fashion table top game. If you have an imagination and fun friends to play with give this a try. ( mind you we are doing this without hot seat or multiplayer, image if we had that!)\n\nIn short I am very happy that my bias for DLC’s went away almost instantly, “sell me as many DLC's for this game as you want!" if they are useful and enhances the game like the current DLC’s.  If you love fantasy strategy games give this version of the game a try, you will love it more and more every turn you take, there is something different and new for your imagination to create in good fun!

It's a very detailed strategy game that includes Civilization style kingdom/empire building from a starting date (after a world-shattering cataclysm) until you achieve one of multiple possible victories over the competition. Similarities to Civilization include focusing research to unlock new city improvements, resources, units, and abilities; expanding your country through exploration or conquest; making trade agreements, treaties, and war with other factions; and turn-based actions for all levels of the game.\n\nHowever, this game also includes a lot of plot. There are some default scenarios you can play to see what the underlying relationship is between each of the sovereigns. Even if you choose to just do a custom map or pre-set map without a scenario, you are able to control a soverign character and heroes s/he recruits to complete quests, explore the map, and level up customized ability trees. This comes into play into the larger faction planning because leveling these characters unlocks abilities and bonuses that can boost any other aspect of the game and can lead to extremely powerful units that can trounce through ordinary enemies. There's not as many factions as similar games, but the bonuses are fairly unique to each sovereign and allow for enough variation that trying different game types is a good way to learn new strategies.\n\nThe fantasy theme is also very fun. There was a lot of effort and creative writing with the incredible number of quests and lore that is inlcuded in each game. The DLC adds even more.\n\nOverall, I just haven't gotten bored with this game. It's a lot of fun and worth the full price, though I did find it on sale when I purchased it. That said, if I had played a demo beforehand, I would have gladly paid the full price if no sale was offered. I had no qualms about paying for DLC, each of the ones I have so far were worth it.","November 26, 2014","true","445.8"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

First you need to build your first city, then set research, then maybe you can wait a few turns to build a scout, then maybe find something interesting outside of a two tile radius of where you started the game, and a few turns later, maybe finish researching sticks with pointy ends so you can make spearmen.\n\nOr in other words, in spite of how this game tries to sell itself, this game is basically just Civilization with a new coat of paint and a spellbook mechanic.  (Notably, spellbooks are also tied to tech trees, so you get even more "sit and watch a progress bar fill up" fun.)\n\nOne would think that after over two decades, the formula for these games would be getting refined - even Civilization itself has, for the past decade, done much to try to lessen the micromanagement - but this game and the other low-budget Civ clones prove that some people are just averse to new ideas.\n\nIn essence, the point of this game is to build cities, expand cities, kill barbarians - I mean monsters - and finally get a conquest/diplomacy/research/whatever ending.\n\nThere's also a unit customization screen, although that made a whole lot more sense in Galactic Civilizations than here, and the low polys on the characters and fact that selecting a cloak makes your character go bald make it both a bit frustrating and unsatisfying as a means of customizing your troops.  At best, you can make one class of soldier have a red hat instead of a green one to tell them apart more easily.\n\nI can't recommend this game, as anyone who would want to play a 4X like this might as well play the much better-polished Civ V.","January 2, 2015","false","2.1"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

As other people have said, this is Civilization meets HoMM, both of which are series that I have enjoyed very much. There is also a resemblance to Age of Wonders. Many of the elements of this game are very well done.\nPros:\n+Turn Based Combat System is well executed in general\n+Graphics are decent for Turn-Based 4x games\n+Customisable Characters\n+Interesting weapon array\n+Interesting skills available\n+Quest system is really cool\n\nCons:\n-Game is a bit too complex (for me), as an RPG is good, as a 4x is good, but both is a bit confusing and hard to manage\n-Hard to understand city system and resources (not clear enough what buildings actually do and how the city evolves)\n-Too easy to build pioneers, cities should be hard to build!!\n\nIn conclusion, I feel this game would appeal to fans of civilization who like to play the game on normal or slow settings and fans of total war. This game requires a lot of effort to understand the mechanics but it *might be* worth it. For me though, I didn't feel it was replayable enough as every game seemed to feel the same (I just wanted things to hurry up!), and perhaps I missed out on important aspects of the game. I'm giving it a 'Yes' recommendation as there is no 'Maybe' button and it was nice to give a trial weekend.\n\nRecommend?

A stand-a-lone game by Stardock, upon the opening intro I see interesting artwork and fantasy. The story line or plot is pretty basic. You choose between 10 soverign or heros, who aim to rule/conquer the world of Elemental. Witch has been torn asunder and is in ruins ripe to be brought together again by cataclysm. The soverigns themselves and their civilizations are very themed and have a style of their own. A unique gameplay for whoever you choose. I selected Magnar. I was drawn to (naturally) by his warlock abilities and the story line of ( I'm a dragon/human thing called a Quendar, Were old and ancient and you're not. So I shall make slaves and use fire and death magic to rule the weak. ) Cool huh? A short tuturial and you can jump into the game.  Using you'r soverign you build and take over the world of Elemental. Build settlements and watchposts to increase your economy and research warfare/civilization/magic. It took a while to get the hang of all the micro-managing but after a while I think I got the hang of it. More heros DO join your civilization, while it grows in fame and fortune. Witch they want a part of , butt chose wisely your heros to your strengths and game play. Also you have to build an army or two to kill wild animals, bandits, undead, demons, trolls, ogres and everything else you can think of in the fantasy world. I was rather impressed by the monster library in the game. During all this you can also pick up quests to complete mainly by killing or collecting things while your doing your build civilization thang. And then you have the other soverigns to deal with ! Oh yeah and there is these huge epic elemental boss guys that'll pop up that'll try to destroy you....This game was interestingly addicting by the fact of I MUST BUILD MY EMPIRE BIGGER.  and level up my soverin and heros to rule the weak. An almost primal urge of destroy and conquer kinda takes over.

So if you like civilization games, turn based games, empire building games and/or strategy games you can't go wrong with this title.","January 3, 2015","true","87.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

As other people have said, this is Civilization meets HoMM, both of which are series that I have enjoyed very much. There is also a resemblance to Age of Wonders. Many of the elements of this game are very well done.\nPros:\n+Turn Based Combat System is well executed in general\n+Graphics are decent for Turn-Based 4x games\n+Customisable Characters\n+Interesting weapon array\n+Interesting skills available\n+Quest system is really cool\n\nCons:\n-Game is a bit too complex (for me), as an RPG is good, as a 4x is good, but both is a bit confusing and hard to manage\n-Hard to understand city system and resources (not clear enough what buildings actually do and how the city evolves)\n-Too easy to build pioneers, cities should be hard to build!!\n\nIn conclusion, I feel this game would appeal to fans of civilization who like to play the game on normal or slow settings and fans of total war. This game requires a lot of effort to understand the mechanics but it *might be* worth it. For me though, I didn't feel it was replayable enough as every game seemed to feel the same (I just wanted things to hurry up!), and perhaps I missed out on important aspects of the game. I'm giving it a 'Yes' recommendation as there is no 'Maybe' button and it was nice to give a trial weekend.\n\nRecommend? Maybe.","January 4, 2015","true","4.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

A stand-a-lone game by Stardock, upon the opening intro I see interesting artwork and fantasy. The story line or plot is pretty basic. You choose between 10 soverign or heros, who aim to rule/conquer the world of Elemental. Witch has been torn asunder and is in ruins ripe to be brought together again by cataclysm. The soverigns themselves and their civilizations are very themed and have a style of their own. A unique gameplay for whoever you choose. I selected Magnar. I was drawn to (naturally) by his warlock abilities and the story line of ( I'm a dragon/human thing called a Quendar, Were old and ancient and you're not. So I shall make slaves and use fire and death magic to rule the weak. ) Cool huh? A short tuturial and you can jump into the game.  Using you'r soverign you build and take over the world of Elemental. Build settlements and watchposts to increase your economy and research warfare/civilization/magic. It took a while to get the hang of all the micro-managing but after a while I think I got the hang of it. More heros DO join your civilization, while it grows in fame and fortune. Witch they want a part of , butt chose wisely your heros to your strengths and game play. Also you have to build an army or two to kill wild animals, bandits, undead, demons, trolls, ogres and everything else you can think of in the fantasy world. I was rather impressed by the monster library in the game. During all this you can also pick up quests to complete mainly by killing or collecting things while your doing your build civilization thang. And then you have the other soverigns to deal with ! Oh yeah and there is these huge epic elemental boss guys that'll pop up that'll try to destroy you....This game was interestingly addicting by the fact of I MUST BUILD MY EMPIRE BIGGER.  and level up my soverin and heros to rule the weak. An almost primal urge of destroy and conquer kinda takes over. A lot of content to get lost in while you play It's defineitly a game to pick up if you have a chance.","January 3, 2015","true","12.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Absolutely not.\nWould I pay 30$ for this game? Absolutely not.\nWould I pay 20$ for this game? Yes.\n\nThis is based off of roughly 10 hours of play time.\n\nFIRST HOUR.\nThe game has a somewhat clunky UI. It doesn't fully teach the player what to do when it comes to building a city or, better yet, maintaining a city properly once you level up a city and begin to expand. I don't care for a game holding my hand throughout but I feel with a game like this, you need to actually teach a player how to get their feet on the ground before thrusting them in the middle of a "Civilization-esque" RTS. I had no idea what to do for the first 45 minutes or so and even afterwards still had to sit and think how to do certain actions. Yes, I played through the tutorial. It did not help. Its very basic.\n\nCHARACTER/FACTIONS.\nI played with 3 different characters (roughly 3 hours apiece), 2 premade characters and one custom made "Aragorn-like" character that focused on using a bow and buffing his allies. This is where the game shines. Each character and faction is unique and interesting as well as potent if you expand and progress correctly. Creating a character took roughly 10 minutes and was enjoyable through the entire process. One of the things that is very different and seperates this game from others is that your hero levels up and becomes stronger. Skill trees are always a plus.\n\nQUESTING.\nOne of the activities you can do in the game is do "Quest". Basically your hero walks into an Inn and someone says "Hey, go across the map and do this. If you succeed, I'll give you something." Then you do it. It's pretty basic but its something to do and it rewards your hero with neat little items and gear.\n\nWOULD I RETURN.\nI would buy the game (I've already deleted it once it regained the 40$ pricetag), if it dropped in price. I enjoyed the majority of my time and I'd love to go back and see how my character (which was directly based off my Dungeons and Dragons character) dealt with this ominous Black Gate area that was locked off from the rest of the map.\n\nThis game is a STRONG 7/10.

No multiplayer?! I assumed it had multiplayer since every similar game that went before it has multiplayer, but boy was I stupid not to have checked that little detail beforehand. And there won't be any multiplayer in the future either.\n\nOh well, I like to play those games in single player mode too, so all's not lost... And the gameplay is great. It's better than HoMM and AoW. It really is a step forward, and not only graphically.\n\nBut that positive note was dashed almost immediately. This game is buggier than an ant-farm (on windows XP certainly, on windows 7 less so). It used to crash right before it saved (only a game that corrupts its own savegames is more annoying), but still I had to save often because a slew of other things could go wrong, so many actions could lead to crippling or annoying bugs that it isn't possible to sum them up here. After a few updates the saving issue was gone but other bugs popped up. To this day the bugs make this game practically unplayable, and that is a crying shame, because it really is a good game at heart.\n\n7/10 if they get the bugs out. 3/10 as it is right now.","January 16, 2014","false","11.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It feels like this game was tailor made for me. It's a mix of Civ and Heroes of Might and Magic without stripping down the hefty ideas from those two games. This is a very deep strategy game that allows for a lot of customisation - a sentence that always wins me over. So far I have been able to create an evil mage warlord from a fantasy story I wrote a long time ago and live out his career. The game is moulding itself around my play style rather than the other way around which is an absolute win. I forsee many late nights with this one.

Personally, I don't like turn-based games because I don't have the patience to wait for my next turn. But, somehow, I still bought this game because I like the RPG-element in it. Against my expectations I really liked the game because the world looks pretty awesome with the magic and monsters (especially the dragons.. I love dragons). I have spent a lot of time creating new factions and sovereigns because you want to try everything out when you see something new.\nNOTE: Sovereigns and heroes are not the same thing in this game.\n\nThe point of the game is to build a kingdom/empire, research and defeat or work together with the enemy AI's, kill monsters (there are dragons, giant spiders and some really epic monsters I  haven't encountered yet) and there can be an event going on like the plague, the shroud (can't remember what it was). All in all, you must make a lot of choices; Shall I attack these monsters and leave my base undefended or shall I make a new squad to defend my base while I'm attacking the enemy? Shall I research better armor or do I need to research better economics?\n\nDoing quests around the map gives you items (sometimes unique ones) which your sovereign or hero can equip. Doing quests also increases your fame, fame will get you heroes, heroes will make your army stronger.\n\nI had a bit of problem getting the hang of this game. The tutorial wasn't really helpful which is a shame. By restarting the game a few times you will learn the game step by step. So don't expect to get the hang of it right away.\n\nPros:\n+ Lots of choices between factions and heroes.\n+ Nice graphics (world, kingdoms/empires) when zoomed out.\n+ Lots of enemies.\n+ Challenging.\n+ Customizing your own faction and Sovereign.\n\nCons:\n- Most of the battles you will be selecting auto-result (skip the fighting stuff and know the result right away)\n- Bad graphics (npc's and some monsters) when zoomed in.\n- Hard to get the hang of this game (I suggest watching some youtube video's first).\n- When heroes fall they will have permanently decreased stats.\n- Unpredictable AI. Sometimes out of nowhere they start a war or are angry.\n\nIf I had to give this game a score I would give it a 7.5.","February 20, 2014","true","33.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

There might as well not even be other factions in the game. They do nothing. You can literally stand next to one of thier cities filled with units,  with one unit of ours, and they won't even come out to kill you.\nThey might send a pioneer (non combat unit) to take over your undefended outposts, but that's it. This has got to be the weakest AI I've ever seen in any strategy game to date.\n\nIt's too bad. The game feels like a pretty good framework for a 4x stratgy game. Really all it is, is you progressing through the tech tree and fighting the romaing monsters for kicks.\n\nThe combat would be better if it was more tactical. It's grid based, Most units only move 2 squares in tactical combat which annoys you when you are fighting an enemy with archers who will all concentrate fire on your chanpion. You have to load him up with dodge equipment to kill the dumb AI that just sits there shooting you with arrows. They have mounted units that move more squares, but each faction only gets one flavor. You are _forced_ to use those against archers. Makes eveyr fight the same. Send mounted units to archers, and mop up with everything else. The AI always coincentrates fire on your champion, even if a unit on the board is a bigger threat.\n\nThe unit progression makes one unit completely worthless against another. You pretty much find out what the most OP unit for a given faction is and just crank those out. Not much variety in combat that way. As you tech up, there really is no point in using anything but the best unit available.\n\nSome of the roaming monsters are rediculous. They move 5-6x before you even get an action, castin spells that instantly kill everyone. It makes it more of a puzzles to figure out where and how to get units resistant to whatever they cast, rather than a combt.\n\nEverything moves 2 squares at a time on the campaign map, making it a real pain the ♥♥♥♥ to hunt down all the worthless AI's pioneer spam. You can cast a force march to move 3 squares, but it can only be active on one unit at a time.\n\nIn summary:\nThe AI sucks hard and there were a few questionable desing decisions. It can be entertaining for a day or two, but it is no masterpiece.","May 31","false","38.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

I honestly do believe this is the spiritual successor to Age of Wonders or the closest we shall get to it, which is something I've always dreamed would happen.At first I pirated the game and on the second day after I went and purchased it off Steam to support the developers in what way I can, I was that impressed. It has so many layers from the research, the rpg-style exploration and questing to the empire building and warfare. Stardock has really impressed me with how much support they have gone and given this game, it is a light and day difference in terms of quality from the original Elemental to Legendary Heroes and this tells me they really do care about their product and their support for such a great game will not be ending anytime soon. I'll end by saying that the "one more turn" feeling we all love and crave has been captured very well so far for me with Legendary Heroes and what more can you ask for with a game like this? Turn based strategy fans shouldn't even hesitate on giving this game a try and spreading the word. I've been greatly impressed with the amount of work and detail put into this game.

There's just so much going on, so much custimization, so many options, and so much thought process that seems to need to go into every single turn to be successful, to a new player the whole experience can be more then a little overwhelming.\n\nNow that's not inherently a bad thing, obviously its not the game for you if your looking mindless fun, but if you enjoy a good strategic experience, a game having this much meat to it can be a really good thing, and can allow for a tremendous amount of depth and replay value.\n\nWhat it DOES mean, however, is that its absolutely crucial that the game has a top notch tutorial to ease a new player into the complexities the game has to offer.  There are various ways this can be accomplished, though my favorites have always been games which provide multiple missions/quests which start with only a small portion of the game available, and incremently add on more and more until by the end the player has had time to at least begin to understand each aspect of the game and is not putting it all together.\n\nUnfortunately, that is not the case with FE:LH.  The single player campaigns, while enjoyable, are not very informative or what I'd consider good learning tools.  Although there is a dedicated tutorial, its not very long, it mainly just shows you "how" to do a handful of things, then its over, providing very little information as to the why, and generaly leaving the players head spinning from the massive information dump.  It's reminsicent of some fighting games whose tutorials invovle asking you to do a bunch of a characters special moves, you do them, and then the tutorial is over.  You come away knowing these are things you can do, but not really knowing when or why you should do them, and it was all over so fast you probably won't even remember half of the moves once your in a match.\n\nDespite the lack of new player friendliness, I'm still giving this game a recommend.  Why?  Because I'm finding that if you're willing to endure a pretty terrible introductory experience and learn the concepts of the game the hard way, the actual game itself is quite well made and actually pretty darn fun.  I honestly feel that if this game had a quality tutorial this would be one of the better PC games out there, maybe even a must own.  As it is though, it takes a very special kind of dedicated player (or some one already familar with the 4x genre) to spend the hours learning things the hard way it takes to actually get to the fun part where you know what your doing and your making meaningful choices instead of random ones, so keep this in mind before purchasing.","February 15, 2014","true","19.7"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","2"

For starters, you can customize your character so that you can choose what type you want it to be or you can just play with the pre-selected ones. As for the mechanics, its quite hectic. You face other sovereigns in the map and its practically 'the faster, the better'. You need to outpace your enemies in building your city, training your units, and collecting resources for enchantments. This game requires a lot of time, and if you are quite busy, then this could mean that you cannot play it to your heart's content. However, if you love strategy games , then this could fit your bill. Personally, i like the game. As a battle realms lover, i have always loved outpacing my enemies in building our bases and farming resources, and these elements are all present in this game but with much, much more content.\n-On the flipside, game is buggy. It frequently crashes and sometimes requires me to restart my pc/laptop. I also found it a bit annoying that they require you to sign-up in their site, i mean for what purpose really? I sure do hope that the bugs will eventually be fixed.","August 8, 2015","true","7.6"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

The fantasy setting infused with magic can be a nice change of pace from the more reality based Civ5. The hero leveling, upgrade, and equipment mechanics are very nice. The devlop stories over time, complete with scars and injuries for defeats in battle. The city system isn't as flexible as Civ5, but is more tailored. While you can only build cities in select locations, each city can be customized from the start. first selecting the focus of the city, then the structures and "wonders" built. The multipul win conditions is a standard in 4x nowadays, but the victory conditions here are a little more satisfying.\n\nIt is slightly buggy, but not game breakingly so. The menus and UI need more polish. The overall gameplay can get a little stale sometimes(IMO).\n\nThe battles are a little more hands on with a turn based, grid battleground. I enjoy this more than just stacks of numbers duking it out on a world map. There is an auto-resolve option if you don't want to. It is what it is. You like it or you don't.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n(Not really a bad review, just raising a flag for an issue that some players may want to be aware of)\n\nLooking at my play time you may say "That's not enough for a proper review", and you're absolutely right. I may get around to playing it at some point, but not today. Here's why...\n\nThis is not a review of the game, as I stopped before I made it to a menu. 3rd party DRM via Stardock Launcher needing a Stardock account. Not a real issue, pretty silly reason to give it a negative review. Only reason I've even writing this is because I have to. 3rd Party DRM is nowhere to be found on the store page. You can only figure it out by sifting through other reviews to find ones like this. If they had just listed this on the page, this review wouldn't even exist. Companies like Kalypso(Tropico series) have similar DRM, using their own launcher requiring an account. Meh, it's unwelcome and bothersome, but they're just trying to protect the software they worked hard on(lol, like it actually stops piracy). Weather it's due to an oversight or a shady nusniess model, it's the fact that they didn't list it that I'm rebeling to. Not cool to withold information until you have a persons money. Had I not got this for peanuts from HumbleBundle, I'd have returned it already.\n\nI'm sure this won't bother most, and it sounds like the game is pretty fun. I hope the game brings many hours of enjoyment to you. Just wanted to put this out there for those few of you it does matter too. Happy gaming!\n\n(P.S. It is a silly reason, so I've decided to play it anyway, but the 'thumbs down' remains until the game redeems itself)","July 22, 2015","true","23.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","2"

The game is mostly like Age of Wonders especially considering that you have a hero/champion to lead each army you create, however, it is also like Civilzation with the aspects of occupying parts of the map as your cities grow.  Another aspect I like is the world monsters such as dragons, I think that is pretty awesome compared to fighting with simple bandits.  It also uses a similar combat system to that of Age of Wonders 3 which requires you to fight in a tactical grid like movement and turns, think Heroes of Might & Magic in this aspect.\nAll in all its a fun game and if you like the ones I mentioned you should certainly pick this one up too, if you haven't played them I recommend those also.","June 29, 2014","true","16.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Have never had a problem with gameplay such as crashes or problems of that nature. The deep upgrade mechanics and especially the ability to create your own factions and unit in game, that then becomes part of your game to play with as you wish it one of most interesting features of any I've ever played (And since this is my fav genre that means a lot). I will admit that I wont buy any of Stardocks newer titles due to their incorperation of a 34rd party drm, I guess they think they have on the same level as EA and Ubisoft which is NOT an example I would want to follow if they have any sense. Whther they believe it or not, they will lose a lot of sales in  jumping on that bandwagon (A wagon most companies have abandoned due to the reporcussions, as most gamers just are not going to put up with it). Still, THIS game does not incorporate that crap so you are in the clear from that crap. As to the price, this is way too much for ANY game imo, but if ya got the money go for it. If not, wait for a sale of any kind. 20@ or under and it's worth it....the DLC likewise is worth it for the partifular game, so many games have dlc that don't do much, the DLC in this game does add enough to justify buying it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sakkano/recommended/228260/","sakkano","Sakkano","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sakkano/","146 products in account","Edit 2/22:\n\nHaving won my first game, I can definately say that the tactical battle system is very good. It's imporved upon, but I'm still somewhat iffy about the use of ranged fighters. Not only can a ranged fighter fling thier projectile clear across the battlefield, but obstructions mean nothing. A company of archer types can launch their volly though what should be completely solid objects. So there is no hiding from these units in the sense of using the environment.\n\nI'm on the fence about how fame is used as a gate mechanic for heroes, especially since it's very possible to blow though those gates and get high leveled heroes while your sovereign is either struggling in a remote location, or sitting in a city, busy in the administer role. While the old mechanic did make acquiring heroes a little easier and a lot more frequent, the heroes that you would run into weren't uber-powered without good reason.\n\nSomething I find bothersome is the water, and that's somewhat a two-fold issue. The first part is that water, aside from rivers and swamps, are untraversable. There is no naval mechanic in the game as it stands. This leads to the second issue; the map. While the game has a basic grid, a hex system leads to more naturally shapped coastline. This means your land looks less boxy when looking at maps. But the major problem with the map is that no matter what, the map is all one continet or a group of subcontinets. Islands don't exist. This means that you will inevitablly come into contact with every rival faction if you haven't been killed already. It's not a case of *IF* as much as *WHEN*.\n\nI do like the political parts of the game. The AI isn't as stingy and stupid as it has been in other similar games. If the AI considers you a threat and it has no real way to stand up to you, that dominion will more than likely make contact with you and offer tribute. But sometimes the AI likes to brag about it's research in the most inappropriate ways. Having about 3/4ths of my tech trees completed, one dominion bragged about how it was reclaiming the ancient teachings of archery. I felt like this would be like North Korea bragging to Japan how awesome it is that they have computers that can now use 3.5in floppy disks. I sighed and ignored them, hellbent on fulfilling the requirements for the Spell of Making.\n\n--\n\nEdit 2/21:\n\nAfter about three hours of fiddling around with files and discovering that the prefs.ini file was not being acquired though the Steam client, I got to play the game as it was intended. As such, this is my honest review.\n\nTBS and 4x are a nice combination and I rather enjoy it. However, I think others might have some problems, I know I still kind of do. The AI is crazy difficult, so if you want a truly easy game to understand how to play, you need to set the difficulty to NOVICE, especially if this is your first time playing.\n\nI enjoy building armies of custom units, upgrading them accordingly, and rteaching heroes abilities to make them better in my conquests, but the game might get a little slowed with the citybuilding aspect. It can take a while to get a city going, and you really need to know the order in which you shoudl construct buildings before you really get into the nitty-gritty of the game.\n\nCombat is both fun and challenging at the same time. The challenge comes from the initiative feature, so it's important to pay close attention to your initiative bar before really doing anything foolish. So you really need to put consideration into timing, building and upgrading units and understanding the mechanics of battle.\n\nThe storyline is pretty non-existant. The Cataclysm happened and the races are all scrambling about trying to get re-established as dominions. There are two side, Kingdom and Empire and to say either is a good guy or bad guy remains to be seen. It can be rather relative in this game. However being aligned with either of these two "superfactions" makes negotiations with the opposing "superfactions" a little more difficult because of an inherent mistrust. And just because you;re aligned with one dosen;t mean the other factions will be nice and leave you alone. No, if you're weak, they will smell the blood in the water and crush you just as well as the other side would.\n\nSo with this said, after the hours long struggle to actually get this game to work, it's really not a bad game. It might be slow for some, but it has a ncie balance of elements that makes it fairly challenging and fun.\n\n--\n\nOriginal\n\nWow, just, wow. This is perhaps the most bugged-out game I have EVER tried. While I like the whole building a town and stuff, the game is bugged. The first problem is that you can't set the options. Second problem is that you can't save. I've been told that I need to access the Prefs.ini files, but those aren't apparent for me to change. There are people who have posted how to fix these difficulties my manipulating that .ini file, but perhaps it's Windows 10 and some compatability issues in which the game does not generate the prefs.ini file? If the game is this difficult in just the technical aspects, there's no way I can even suggest gameplay. If it's like it's orgin game, Elemental: War of Magic, you're totally SOL as that game had ALWAYS spawned all the factions next to each other.\n\nBut do you realize the frustration of playing a game for 4ish hours, saving to get some sleep, and comming back to find that there is no save data?\n\nAnother problem, if the game was bundled in the Ultimate Edition, a similar issue happens with fallen Enchantress; the options menu is locked the same way. But to make it worse, you can't zoom in any closer than the cloth map, or else the map is rendered as a grey field.","February 20","true","37.4"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

I played on easy and felt that the pacing was a little to fast as far as difficulty advancement, but this didn't hinder how fun it was. The quests have stories to go along that may involve getting new equipment, general, or army guys, which makes questing very worth it.\n\nI don't really like the tutorials, but as someone who still hasn't done it, I really suggest doing it. I can't seem to figure out how to get "guild points" as they don't seem to act the same as in Civilization even though it looks like it came from that game. There are little differences that if you have played or haven't played Civilization, it really makes the tutorial quite appealing.\n\nI was disappointed to have so many characters and only about three (way less than half; not even a quarter) were female. However, the female characters that were there had great backgrounds and characters, unlike other games where females are token characters / boring sex symbols.\n\nThere is no customization except for naming stuff, and the buildings are automatically placed in order that you choose to build them.","August 12, 2015","true","4.8"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sakkano/recommended/228260/","sakkano","Sakkano","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sakkano/","146 products in account","Edit 2/22:\n\nHaving won my first game, I can definately say that the tactical battle system is very good. It's imporved upon, but I'm still somewhat iffy about the use of ranged fighters. Not only can a ranged fighter fling thier projectile clear across the battlefield, but obstructions mean nothing. A company of archer types can launch their volly though what should be completely solid objects. So there is no hiding from these units in the sense of using the environment.\n\nI'm on the fence about how fame is used as a gate mechanic for heroes, especially since it's very possible to blow though those gates and get high leveled heroes while your sovereign is either struggling in a remote location, or sitting in a city, busy in the administer role. While the old mechanic did make acquiring heroes a little easier and a lot more frequent, the heroes that you would run into weren't uber-powered without good reason.\n\nSomething I find bothersome is the water, and that's somewhat a two-fold issue. The first part is that water, aside from rivers and swamps, are untraversable. There is no naval mechanic in the game as it stands. This leads to the second issue; the map. While the game has a basic grid, a hex system leads to more naturally shapped coastline. This means your land looks less boxy when looking at maps. But the major problem with the map is that no matter what, the map is all one continet or a group of subcontinets. Islands don't exist. This means that you will inevitablly come into contact with every rival faction if you haven't been killed already. It's not a case of *IF* as much as *WHEN*.\n\nI do like the political parts of the game. The AI isn't as stingy and stupid as it has been in other similar games. If the AI considers you a threat and it has no real way to stand up to you, that dominion will more than likely make contact with you and offer tribute. But sometimes the AI likes to brag about it's research in the most inappropriate ways. Having about 3/4ths of my tech trees completed, one dominion bragged about how it was reclaiming the ancient teachings of archery. I felt like this would be like North Korea bragging to Japan how awesome it is that they have computers that can now use 3.5in floppy disks. I sighed and ignored them, hellbent on fulfilling the requirements for the Spell of Making.\n\n--\n\nEdit 2/21:\n\nAfter about three hours of fiddling around with files and discovering that the prefs.ini file was not being acquired though the Steam client, I got to play the game as it was intended. As such, this is my honest review.\n\nTBS and 4x are a nice combination and I rather enjoy it. However, I think others might have some problems, I know I still kind of do. The AI is crazy difficult, so if you want a truly easy game to understand how to play, you need to set the difficulty to NOVICE, especially if this is your first time playing.\n\nI enjoy building armies of custom units, upgrading them accordingly, and rteaching heroes abilities to make them better in my conquests, but the game might get a little slowed with the citybuilding aspect. It can take a while to get a city going, and you really need to know the order in which you shoudl construct buildings before you really get into the nitty-gritty of the game.\n\nCombat is both fun and challenging at the same time. The challenge comes from the initiative feature, so it's important to pay close attention to your initiative bar before really doing anything foolish. So you really need to put consideration into timing, building and upgrading units and understanding the mechanics of battle.\n\nThe storyline is pretty non-existant. The Cataclysm happened and the races are all scrambling about trying to get re-established as dominions. There are two side, Kingdom and Empire and to say either is a good guy or bad guy remains to be seen. It can be rather relative in this game. However being aligned with either of these two "superfactions" makes negotiations with the opposing "superfactions" a little more difficult because of an inherent mistrust. And just because you;re aligned with one dosen;t mean the other factions will be nice and leave you alone. No, if you're weak, they will smell the blood in the water and crush you just as well as the other side would.\n\nSo with this said, after the hours long struggle to actually get this game to work, it's really not a bad game. It might be slow for some, but it has a ncie balance of elements that makes it fairly challenging and fun.\n\n--\n\nOriginal\n\nWow, just, wow. This is perhaps the most bugged-out game I have EVER tried. While I like the whole building a town and stuff, the game is bugged. The first problem is that you can't set the options. Second problem is that you can't save. I've been told that I need to access the Prefs.ini files, but those aren't apparent for me to change. There are people who have posted how to fix these difficulties my manipulating that .ini file, but perhaps it's Windows 10 and some compatability issues in which the game does not generate the prefs.ini file? If the game is this difficult in just the technical aspects, there's no way I can even suggest gameplay. If it's like it's orgin game, Elemental: War of Magic, you're totally SOL as that game had ALWAYS spawned all the factions next to each other.\n\nBut do you realize the frustration of playing a game for 4ish hours, saving to get some sleep, and comming back to find that there is no save data?\n\nAnother problem, if the game was bundled in the Ultimate Edition, a similar issue happens with fallen Enchantress; the options menu is locked the same way. But to make it worse, you can't zoom in any closer than the cloth map, or else the map is rendered as a grey field.","February 20","true","37.4"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

This game is an ongoing tragedy in what not to do as a game developer.  From the very beginning (in its first incarnation as Elemental: War of Magic) this game was doomed to failure.  From its horrid UI, to it's uninspired gameplay, vintage 1990's graphics, and abysmal balance--the game plays more like a college student's unfinished Unity 3D project than anything else.  How it has garnered fans of any kind is beyond me.\n\nI've always enjoyed games such as: Master of Magic, Disciples, Heroes of Might and Magic, and Age of Wonders, so, as a longtime supporter of Stardock/Bred Wardell, I was looking forward to their foray into the realm of Fantasy 4x.  One word sums up my experience:  Disappointment.  For the life of me, I don't understand how a game developer that produced Galactic Civilizations could produce something so unpolished and uninspired like Elemental/Fallen Enchantress.  It's like they didn't even research the genre--they just looked at Master of Magic and said, "Well, we can do better than that!".  The only problem with that point of view is that other/better developers had already made better fantasy 4x games, and had been pushing the genre forward for nearly a decade.\n\nFallen Enchantress is a failed attempt at saving an aborted development project, nothing more.  A new development director was hired to rework the UI and add (i.e., "tack on") some new features--things like distict races, unique abilites, etc.--things that should have already been part of the initial design--in a desperate attempt to save an already-doomed game.  For some people, this was enough.  Gamers unfamiliar with the fantasy 4x genre liked what they saw, while veterans of the genre just asked the question:  "Why?  Why try to save this game?  Just let it go already."\n\nThere are no bright spots with this game--not when you look around at all of the other, better fantasy 4x games that are out there.  As already mentioned, the main flaw with this game is that Stardock developed it in a vacuum, in isolation, and thought they were doing something monumental.  If this were the 1980s/early 1990s, they might have actually pulled it off.  Unfortunately, this game game out in the 2010+ era of PC games, and, quite frankly, PC gamers deserve better than this lukewarm dalliance with hubris.\n\nAlso, if you actually compared this game to the Civilization series ..... shame on you.","November 30, 2014","false","1.8"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

I've never seen a game with so many different foes and characters save Age of Wonders III and the Warlock series. You can play the campaigns and have a wonderful time. But if you play a random map with random enemies and random other stuff, you're in for a real treat.

I love the graphics and gameplay. But I mostly like the scope. In my opinion, Endless Legend gets far too much hype. THIS is the game that inspired that one and others that came afterwards. The UI may be a bit rough around the edges but that's small potatoes compared to the game's engine. You have stacks of stuff to see, quest to pursue, and enemies to engage. I've never seen a game with so many different foes and characters save Age of Wonders III and the Warlock series. You can play the campaigns and have a wonderful time. But if you play a random map with random enemies and random other stuff, you're in for a real treat. Make sure to add all the DLCs.","September 4, 2015","true","70.9"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

It just appears to be a lightly modified and improved version of the last Fallen Enchantress game, unlike the really awesome Endless Legend which has a lot more variety and feel to it. I find that even with the enemy AI being set to easy that they are still a great pain in the ♥♥♥.\n\nThe major improvement they have done with this game is made it so that heroes level up in more complex and interesting ways which works well when you make your own kind of hero, however it doesn't excuse being a seporate game from the origonal, in my opinion.\n\nIt'd be worth it on a sale as the game itself is rarther fun and great for anyone looking for a fun 4X game, but I'd stick with Endless Legend instead, which has it's own interesting story unfold too.","January 13","true","8.5"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

I would not recommend this game.\n\nThe gameplay is dull and uninspired, the unit creation is overcomplicated, unit variety is mostly indistinguishable.\n\nThere are also a host of thematic issues that made playing the game a chore, such as the fog of war being far too dark, and undiscovered regions being black.  In Civilization 5 they use a sort of grey cloudcover to hide unexplored regions, which means that most of the pixels on your screen are bright, but the flat black of Fallen Enchantress casts the entire game in a gloomy light, leaving the whole experience feeling hollow.\n\nI wanted to like the game, but when I got the last card I realised how that was the only reason I was continuing to play it.  Just don't bother, there are better games available.","November 25, 2013","false","4.3"," 4 of 12 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","4","12","0","0"

You use outposts to control land area in the game.  However, if an enemy captures an outpost and you re-capture it, the zone of control will be smaller.  If this happens multiple times, the zone of control will be non-existent.  This bug has been in the game since before the expansion came out.  I stopped playing the first time because of the bug, and I've now uninstalled the game and given up on it because the developers don't seem to care about fixing it.\n\nNow, you can just destroy the outpost and rebuild it, but that also means rebuilding all of the addons associated with the outpost, which can get horribly time consuming.\n\nIf the developer ever gets around to fixing this bug, let me know.

I like turn based games in particular I dont really know why this game is so lousy.\n\nMaybe it is the design elements.  The castle building screen is so lousy.  The immersion is lousy.  I guess everything in this game is lousy.  The battles are lousy.  The graphics in the battle is so lousy that I cant understand an old game like Kings Bounty have a better battle screen than this.

But that game rocks and many people who actually complained are playing it for 200-400 hrs+.  Some even for 1000+ hrs.  So that game is worth every cent.

I have no misgivings, FE:LH (this one) has everything in it that Elemental did. So, if you're going to buy one, skip to this one.\n\n\n\n\nDetail:\nSo, I enjoy modding this game. I'm going to say that right up front... so let me break this into two separate sections, vanilla and not.\n\nVanilla:\nIt's a passable strategy game with elements of RPG but not enough to call it an RPG game. Don't come in expecting Civ because that's stupid. Aside from the developers, I see nobody saying anything about Civ in relation to the game except in reviews from people saying its not like Civ (which they expected due to Devs who worked in ome way on Civ).\n\nThe game play is pretty straight forward - make units, fight on a tactical grid-map. Use Block to reduce damage from hits, Dodge to avoid hits (even ranged), and spell resist to avoid magic or damage from magic. The built in options to customize a faction, a hero (sovereign), and your own units lend replability to the game. The AI will use created factions as "minor races" if you aren't using them in a scenario. Always nice.\n\nWhile this is billed as a the Fallen Enchantress come to enslave the world, thats really not it at all. There is a minor campaign that took a tops of 3 hours to complete (and only that cause I like to wander). That dealt with the enchantress, but even then, she was one of the easiest to beat factions. The game is really about random scenarios against random (or selected) factions including your custom ones.\n\nIt IS buggy in some annoying spots:\n-  Basically anywhere that you enter text runs into issues (such as custom facions backstory and custom Hero Backstory).\n-  Custom maps have issues erasing each other in the cartographer tool\n-  Altering generated maps in the Cartographer Tool will sometimes cause creatures to spawn on ocen-cliff tiles and make them unkillable outside of magic\n-  You can only kill the Vanilla "Ridiculous" difficulty setting (well all of them) aren't vastly different from the normal in my experience.\n-  It crashes infrequently, but the autosave feature makes it only a mildly annoying issue (for me).\n\nModded:\n\nThe scripting is pretty easy and straight forward. You can even port in 3D models if you're so inclined. The game was intended for modding but isn't set up for the Steam community. In fact, I doubt its even set up for Stardock (not that I've ever been there).

Fun to play.\n\nThe best thing is that you can create your own troops by choosing their traits and equipment. Too bad that game is balanced so that your only option is to pile up as many magical items on your troops as possible and thus eliminate the power of choise whenever to supply many troops with poor equipment or few troops with expensive equipment.\n\nIn the endgame spells are a bit too powerful. Since there isn't any multiplay, the developers haven't bothered to tune down some cataclysm spells like Volcano, which can eradicate whole cities in few turns and alter the environment so that AI has no clue how to cope with that.","January 26, 2015","true","99.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It has a few fairly noticable bugs. like I had to avoid the tutorials because they made my screen black out entirely. And the user interface I felt was terrible and horribly scattered. I also wish that building custom stuff was simpler but eh. get past that and the character customization was decent and the abilities on leveling were okay. It wasn't that fast paced and the research tree was a little gawdy. But the fantasy appeal of Dragons, epic weapons, epic creatures and crushing cities to dust kept me hanging on. overall I would say 5/10. I would play one whole game.

I have no misgivings, FE:LH (this one) has everything in it that Elemental did. So, if you're going to buy one, skip to this one.\n\n\n\n\nDetail:\nSo, I enjoy modding this game. I'm going to say that right up front... so let me break this into two separate sections, vanilla and not.\n\nVanilla:\nIt's a passable strategy game with elements of RPG but not enough to call it an RPG game. Don't come in expecting Civ because that's stupid. Aside from the developers, I see nobody saying anything about Civ in relation to the game except in reviews from people saying its not like Civ (which they expected due to Devs who worked in ome way on Civ).\n\nThe game play is pretty straight forward - make units, fight on a tactical grid-map. Use Block to reduce damage from hits, Dodge to avoid hits (even ranged), and spell resist to avoid magic or damage from magic. The built in options to customize a faction, a hero (sovereign), and your own units lend replability to the game. The AI will use created factions as "minor races" if you aren't using them in a scenario. Always nice.\n\nWhile this is billed as a the Fallen Enchantress come to enslave the world, thats really not it at all. There is a minor campaign that took a tops of 3 hours to complete (and only that cause I like to wander). That dealt with the enchantress, but even then, she was one of the easiest to beat factions. The game is really about random scenarios against random (or selected) factions including your custom ones.\n\nIt IS buggy in some annoying spots:\n-  Basically anywhere that you enter text runs into issues (such as custom facions backstory and custom Hero Backstory).\n-  Custom maps have issues erasing each other in the cartographer tool\n-  Altering generated maps in the Cartographer Tool will sometimes cause creatures to spawn on ocen-cliff tiles and make them unkillable outside of magic\n-  You can only kill the Vanilla "Ridiculous" difficulty setting (well all of them) aren't vastly different from the normal in my experience.\n-  It crashes infrequently, but the autosave feature makes it only a mildly annoying issue (for me).\n\nModded:\n\nThe scripting is pretty easy and straight forward. You can even port in 3D models if you're so inclined. The game was intended for modding but isn't set up for the Steam community. In fact, I doubt its even set up for Stardock (not that I've ever been there). I use NEXUS forums if I hit a roadblock or want to see what others have done.\nYou can even alter the AI behavior to make the game more challenging, nerf ranged attacks if that's your piece, or do as some folks did and overhaul the game. Or, if you're lazy, download their versions and have the game overhauled for you.\nAlso, you can add in items or nerf existing ones if you feel the game is all about who has the bigger stick.\n\n- Some folks have claimed to fix the above vanilla bugs, I haven't experienced that.\n\n","January 25, 2015","true","139.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

What was the end result of this you say?

Oh my. This game takes what was once known as Elemental: War of Magic and turns it into a game that truely is worthy of the Stardock label. This game so effortlessly combines the roles of empire making games with Dungeons and Dragons style heroic adventures you would be hard pressed to find a match for this game at any point in the history of video games. The graphics while not the most realistic are equally astounding in their artistic flavor, walls look imposing even from the god pov you are in for the entirety of the game. For instance my capital of Iphidar is surrounded by walls that put the walls of Constantinople to shame.\n\nThe integration of magic in this game is so well done as to be second nature within five minutes of starting the game, casting city wide spells to boost productivity or city wide curses on your enemies to make their own citizens fight them has never been so easy or satisfying. Magic is litterally everywhere game. The world has stones littered through out it that act as focal points for magic and allow you to cast spels of greater potency or boost your already existing spells.\n\nLet us mot forget this is an empire building game as well. The governmental aspects of the game are what I have come to expect froma Stardock 4x game. They are in a word amazing. Extremely user friendly while allowing the player to govern all things a real government does i.e. taxes, building, army raising, ect. The interaction between in game states is simply amazing, the ai programmed for this game so realistically reacts to the players actions I am sometimes hard pressed to not believe there is another person controlling them.\n\nMy opinion of this game is very high and am glad Stardock was able to rectify the utter disaster that was Elemental with this game and its predecessor Fallen Enchantress. I highly reccomend this game to all lovers of tactical planning and nation building and who have the patience to deal with the pace of turn based games.","June 9, 2014","true","33.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It plays similar to a cross between Civilization and Heroes of Might and Magic.  It is imperfect but may be the best fantasy 4x game out within the last few years.  Pros and cons listed in DETAIL below if you find them helpful.\n\nPros:\n-Fun gameplay.  It delivers a quality 4x experience.\n-Intuitive mechanics.  If you have played 4x games, you will grasp this game's concepts quickly.\n-Good tactical combat.  You can make a difference if you take command versus just autoresolve everything.  Tactical combat is not as strong as Heroes of Might and Magic or Age of Wonders 3, but it is a fun and useful part of the game.\n-"Tame the land mechanic".  There are plenty of neutral monsters and quests to make expansion more than an uninteresting early-game land grab.\n-Satisfying empire building.  Your cities level just like your heroes, and there are a variety of customizations options for each city.  This is a great mechanic!  Yet city management is streamlined enought that you don't get too bogged down late game with many cities.\n-Custom units.  You can make your own custom military units with their own characteristics once you've gotten the appropriate research and resoruces.  While more customization options would be nice, it is a very cool and welcome mechanic.\n-Minimal waiting in between turns (in contrast to the long waits in Civilization 5).  The AI is thinking about its turn when you are taking yours, so the time it takes to execute their turn is minimal.  This is a big plus.\n\nCons:\n-Graphics are ugly.  I suppose on the spectrum of 4x graphics, it is somewhere in the middle (with Dominions being ugliest and Civilization/Heroes of Might and Magic/ Age of Wonders 3 being pretty).\n-Spells are bland and there are not enough of them.  I was never excited to get access to a new spell.  Spell research is also somewhat confusing - you get spells through a confusing combination of leveling your heroes and through research.  Master of Magic got spells exactly right and I wish more modern games would simply copy and improve on their model.  In MoM, you could make your own towns a paradise (all with nice little spell effects), you could summon awesome units, you could blight an enemy town with pestilence, chaos rifts, etc (all visualized nicely), you could plunge the world into eternal night, and you simply researched each spell individually and intuitively.  FE has fewer and less exciting options.\n-Hero advancement is similarly bland.  Although there was an extensive list of traits to acquire, I was never excited to gain a new level with my hero because none of the traits were that interesting.  Contrast this to the excellent system in the Heroes of Might and Magic series.  In that series, getting Grandmaster Fire Mage or even Basic Logistics was always exciting because the skills were useful and interesting.  This is not so in FE sadly.\n-Not enough fantasy creatures on your side.  You may get about 3 uninteresting summoning spells (only 1 of which is good) that are limited to 1 summoned creature per spell per hero.  So you will not lead a shambling horde of zombies and skeletons or demons like you could in Master of Magic or Dominions.  A few races also have access to 1 fantasy creature that they can recruit directly from towns (and you can even customize, which is cool but really limited).  If you capture the right location on the map or complete a long questline, you may get a dragon (one) as well.  Humanoid troops are nice fodder and need to be there, but they should be 60-70% of your army, not 98% of it.  The reason people want to play this type of game instead of Civilization is specifically FOR the fantasy creatures and the spells!\n-Races are bland.  For some reason, Stardock departed from fantasy conventions of men, elves, orcs, dwarves, etc.  Instead, they have races that are elf-like and dwarf-like and orc-like, but they are  more humanoid and less interesting.  Except for a few structures and traits, they all play similarly.  Again I must compare to Master of Magic where each race had its own unique units and tech tree.  Also compare to HoMM 3 or 5 - each race felt unique and played differently.\n-Weak, uninteresting quest items.  In spite of a lot of questing, I seemed to only get bland, weak, and uninteresting reward items.  I would always replace them from the shop whenever I researched the right tech.\n-Furthermore, there is no mechanic to make your own powerful items.  Master of Magic, Dominions, and to a lesser extent Age of Wonders all got this right.  I should be able to expend considerable magic resources to make a great artifact for my heroes to use.  Whether that's a sword that raises  slain foes as zombie minions, armor that makes the wearer ethereal, a horn that empowers the troops, or a staff that disintegrates the enemy, this mechanic is sorely missing in FE.\n-There is little penalty for heroes defeated in combat.  They simply get a tiny permanent debuff (typically of little to no consequence) and respawn the next turn at low health in your nearest town.  While there should be some mechanism to retrieve your fallen sovereign or save your heroes with extraordinary magic, I personally prefer both my heroes and my enemy's heroes to die and stay dead under most circumstances.  Heck, in Dominions not only did dead characters stay dead (albiet with the possibility of resurrection or magical unlife), they could get significant battle wounds even if they survived victorious combat.  In Heroes of Might and Magic, the defeated hero would abandon your cause entirely.\n-Poor optimization.  The game chugged on my old computer to the point of unplayability mid-game.  It still gets a little chunky on my new Alienware hotrod.  For a game with such primitive 3D graphics, that should not happen!\n\nConclusion:  Recommended to fans of the genre\nThis game is a good, fun empire builder.  As an empire builder, it is better than Age of Wonders III but not quite as good as Civilization 5.  Unfortunately the fantasy elements (spells, hero advancement, fantasy creatures, and races) are quite inferior to games like Master of Magic, Heroes of Might and Magic, Age of Wonders III, and Dominions.  However, the game is greater than the sum of its parts and a good empire builder with (albiet bland) fantasy elements is still a worthy part of a strategy fan's library.  Though I've listed a lot of cons, I really did have a good time with the game.  Its shortcomings didn't bother me until well after I had gotten my money's worth of entertainment.","June 14, 2014","true","39.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game takes more RAM and CPU resources than games far more technologically advanced (i.e. Civ 5, XCOM, Endless Space). It crashes every 3-5 turns. It often freezes during a battle, and reloading a prior save doesn't help. Lastly, reloading saves reliably crashes the game on my computer, and again, I run far more advanced games than this with no problems. I've asked the developer for support and troubleshooting and it never helped. Unlike other games that started out buggy but was fixed and smoothed with patches (i.e. Divinity Original Sin), this game has essentially been abandoned by its developers and I have not seen any fixes for years. What could have been a great game has been ruined by bugs.","November 28, 2015","false","54.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

I have not played Elemental or Fallen Enchantress, but I have read that they are almost the same as FE: Legendary Heroes.\n\nI got this game at 75% so I was not disappointed, at 10$ there is still ample play and it is a good deal, but in the long run I would rather play Master of Magic, which seemed to have a bit more depth and more variety of creatures and magic.\n\nEdit: This game is no where near as good as Age of Wonders III.

The interactivity of research unlocking items that you can put on your troops and heroes so they can be better defended and better armed is really neat.

I did read previous reviews and I can see the Civ 5 comparison and it is valid, there are similarities with city building & tech trees, but it has the extra dimension of having heroes to find loot, do quests, upgrade weapons, armour and skills and it works brilliantly.  It's not as easy as some reviewers claim (unless you save the game before battles and reload if you lose, which I think takes away the fun) but if you like turn based combat you will love it.  You learn to pick your battles, there are no shortage of heroes so if you lose one its not too bad, they do heal after they 'die' but in the early game it does limit what you can do and you will fall behind your rivals. I do like the fact that, unlike most turn based combat, your armies can have up to 9 units so you have a mix of defensive, ranged and attacking units.  Although set in a Fantasy style world I am avoiding magic (alright I do have a healing spell) and with my second attempt (on default settings) I am  managing to hold my own but not always in the lead. I can see many different ways to win, the maps are randomly generated each time, the difficulty setting is variable, the diplomacy is better than Civ 5 and I am looking forward to many happy hours of game play.   I would recommend a look on YouTube before you buy and if you think you might like it you definately will.

Like in Civ you'll manage a growing empire of cities looking to spread across the world, and dominate it via one of several victory conditions.  Unlike with Civ the combat is turn-based tactical where clever use of your stuff will allow a weaker enemy to prevail against a stronger one.  Also the setting is a sort of high fantasy where magic is an important resource, the mastery of which is crucial to the game.\n\nMore importantly, Legendary Heroes lives up to its name by giving each side a sovereign, and several lesser champions which gain in power as if in an RPG.  These heroes can be mages, warriors, or generals, with large and varied skill trees to progress along.  It's this last bit that makes this such a fun game: at the start of the game where many of the early turns are about watching your cities grow your heroes can be mucking about, exploring and killing bandits.\n\nA great entry in the 'just one more turn' category of games, Legendary Heroes does right a lot of things its predecessors did wrong.","January 26, 2014","true","279.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You have options on the customization of creating a world, but I kind of like the slower pace as my units are not obsolete in 10 turns. Research basically allows you to upgrade armor, weapons, etc. of basic units. Not like CIV where you have spearmen, pikemen, etc. They are essentially the same, with different buffs. You can give them fire resitent cloaks, magic necklaces etc. However, it will cost you more in resources. In a strange twist, it is more expensive to buy things for your heroes!\n\nThe AI is pretty decent, but not that good at measuring army strengths and weaknesses. This can lead the AI to wasting expensive troops against their counters. Afterwords, you can mop them up as they have little armor.\n\nOverall, it is engaging and does have that "one more turn" thing.

It plays similar to a cross between Civilization and Heroes of Might and Magic.  It is imperfect but may be the best fantasy 4x game out within the last few years.  Pros and cons listed in DETAIL below if you find them helpful.\n\nPros:\n-Fun gameplay.  It delivers a quality 4x experience.\n-Intuitive mechanics.  If you have played 4x games, you will grasp this game's concepts quickly.\n-Good tactical combat.  You can make a difference if you take command versus just autoresolve everything.  Tactical combat is not as strong as Heroes of Might and Magic or Age of Wonders 3, but it is a fun and useful part of the game.\n-"Tame the land mechanic".  There are plenty of neutral monsters and quests to make expansion more than an uninteresting early-game land grab.\n-Satisfying empire building.  Your cities level just like your heroes, and there are a variety of customizations options for each city.  This is a great mechanic!  Yet city management is streamlined enought that you don't get too bogged down late game with many cities.\n-Custom units.  You can make your own custom military units with their own characteristics once you've gotten the appropriate research and resoruces.  While more customization options would be nice, it is a very cool and welcome mechanic.\n-Minimal waiting in between turns (in contrast to the long waits in Civilization 5).  The AI is thinking about its turn when you are taking yours, so the time it takes to execute their turn is minimal.  This is a big plus.\n\nCons:\n-Graphics are ugly.  I suppose on the spectrum of 4x graphics, it is somewhere in the middle (with Dominions being ugliest and Civilization/Heroes of Might and Magic/ Age of Wonders 3 being pretty).\n-Spells are bland and there are not enough of them.  I was never excited to get access to a new spell.  Spell research is also somewhat confusing - you get spells through a confusing combination of leveling your heroes and through research.  Master of Magic got spells exactly right and I wish more modern games would simply copy and improve on their model.  In MoM, you could make your own towns a paradise (all with nice little spell effects), you could summon awesome units, you could blight an enemy town with pestilence, chaos rifts, etc (all visualized nicely), you could plunge the world into eternal night, and you simply researched each spell individually and intuitively.  FE has fewer and less exciting options.\n-Hero advancement is similarly bland.  Although there was an extensive list of traits to acquire, I was never excited to gain a new level with my hero because none of the traits were that interesting.  Contrast this to the excellent system in the Heroes of Might and Magic series.  In that series, getting Grandmaster Fire Mage or even Basic Logistics was always exciting because the skills were useful and interesting.  This is not so in FE sadly.\n-Not enough fantasy creatures on your side.  You may get about 3 uninteresting summoning spells (only 1 of which is good) that are limited to 1 summoned creature per spell per hero.  So you will not lead a shambling horde of zombies and skeletons or demons like you could in Master of Magic or Dominions.  A few races also have access to 1 fantasy creature that they can recruit directly from towns (and you can even customize, which is cool but really limited).  If you capture the right location on the map or complete a long questline, you may get a dragon (one) as well.  Humanoid troops are nice fodder and need to be there, but they should be 60-70% of your army, not 98% of it.  The reason people want to play this type of game instead of Civilization is specifically FOR the fantasy creatures and the spells!\n-Races are bland.  For some reason, Stardock departed from fantasy conventions of men, elves, orcs, dwarves, etc.  Instead, they have races that are elf-like and dwarf-like and orc-like, but they are  more humanoid and less interesting.  Except for a few structures and traits, they all play similarly.  Again I must compare to Master of Magic where each race had its own unique units and tech tree.  Also compare to HoMM 3 or 5 - each race felt unique and played differently.\n-Weak, uninteresting quest items.  In spite of a lot of questing, I seemed to only get bland, weak, and uninteresting reward items.  I would always replace them from the shop whenever I researched the right tech.\n-Furthermore, there is no mechanic to make your own powerful items.  Master of Magic, Dominions, and to a lesser extent Age of Wonders all got this right.  I should be able to expend considerable magic resources to make a great artifact for my heroes to use.  Whether that's a sword that raises  slain foes as zombie minions, armor that makes the wearer ethereal, a horn that empowers the troops, or a staff that disintegrates the enemy, this mechanic is sorely missing in FE.\n-There is little penalty for heroes defeated in combat.  They simply get a tiny permanent debuff (typically of little to no consequence) and respawn the next turn at low health in your nearest town.  While there should be some mechanism to retrieve your fallen sovereign or save your heroes with extraordinary magic, I personally prefer both my heroes and my enemy's heroes to die and stay dead under most circumstances.  Heck, in Dominions not only did dead characters stay dead (albiet with the possibility of resurrection or magical unlife), they could get significant battle wounds even if they survived victorious combat.  In Heroes of Might and Magic, the defeated hero would abandon your cause entirely.\n-Poor optimization.  The game chugged on my old computer to the point of unplayability mid-game.  It still gets a little chunky on my new Alienware hotrod.  For a game with such primitive 3D graphics, that should not happen!\n\nConclusion:  Recommended to fans of the genre\nThis game is a good, fun empire builder.  As an empire builder, it is better than Age of Wonders III but not quite as good as Civilization 5.  Unfortunately the fantasy elements (spells, hero advancement, fantasy creatures, and races) are quite inferior to games like Master of Magic, Heroes of Might and Magic, Age of Wonders III, and Dominions.  However, the game is greater than the sum of its parts and a good empire builder with (albiet bland) fantasy elements is still a worthy part of a strategy fan's library.  Though I've listed a lot of cons, I really did have a good time with the game.  Its shortcomings didn't bother me until well after I had gotten my money's worth of entertainment.","June 14, 2014","true","39.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Each has its own benefits, and so it's sometimes tough choice as to which one to develop first.\n\nI don't do reviews so it's pretty short and to the point, but overall I would give this game a solid 8.5 for the Turn Based Stragey game class.","June 29, 2014","true","68.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

One thing that I enjoy about the game is that it’s VERY different from other fantasy 4X games in a number of key ways.\n\nFirst, it takes place many years after the world was devastated by a war of magic – it’s essentially a post-apocalyptic fantasy world. Virtually everything concerning magic and technology had been lost (technology in this case being the standard medieval-level of weaponry and military tactics). You’re leading a rag-tag group of survivors to build your faction’s first city and begin to rebuild. Of course, you were chosen as leader because you are one of the only people remaining who can wield magic.\n\nSecondly, there’s none of the standard Orcs, Goblins, Elves, Dwarves, blah blah blah that have become standard fare for fantasy games. The races are all (with the exception of Men) completely original, as are most of the bestiary that pose a constant threat outside of the safety of your cities. However, the game makes all of the new races and creatures easy to understand with a very thorough and easy-to-access online guide that seamlessly integrates lore and story with game mechanics. Want to know what the Trogs can do before you play as them? Just hover over the attribute marker reading TROG BLOOD in the character roster and see their benefits and disadvantages. Got an army of Brood Hunters headed for a city? Just click on the army on the map and click their profile to read all about them and see their stats.\n\nAlso, virtually everything is customizable. Make new leaders, new factions, new units. Just researched Warg Riding and want to make some cavalry? Just pop into the unit design screen and design them, what armor they wear and what weapons they carry, etc. Just make sure you have a source of Wargs handy – depending on what weaponry and armor you give your units, you may need a variety of resources (metal, horses/Wargs, magic crystal, etc) to create them. These can be found on the map and brought under control of your cities by building on them.\n\nAll-in-all, it’s a great game that slipped under the radar to a certain extent.","July 5, 2014","true","57.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It provides you with an excellent array of technology that allows you custom-tailor your play style to fit several methods of play.\n\nMy biggest complaint with the game is that diplomacy is pretty much useless.  Early on, you can get any nation to be your friend.  However, as time progresses, modifiers get added to most diplomatic relations causing them to desire war and not peace.  It's a little disappointing to be honest.\n\nThat aside, however, the game is absolutely great.  The custom unit creator is probably my best feature in which you can design your own military troops to fit whatever needs you have.

It reminds me of Civilisation meets Heroes of Might and Magic plus some more fun stuff.\n\nThe amount of customisation of races, units and the choice to make your own hero adds an extra personalised edge to the game as you end up caring more about your character and making more tactical desicions. The skill trees allow in general are well done the sometimes feel random and not very benefical most of the time I decide "ehh i'll take that I suppose"\n\nUnlike both Civ and Heroes the combat is well done. I'm not finding it stale or boring and it has the option to auto resolve for those easy battles.\n\nSpells seem a bit chaotic and unmanaged but after a while you get used to them.\n\nDefienatly recomend this game to Civ, Heroes of Might and Magic, and Galactic Civ fans.\n\n","February 20, 2014","true","12.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However it is somewhat buggy and lacks many diplomacy options which we see in other games.\n\nLets start with the pro's:\nFun and interesting combat\nGood variety of units\nUNIT CUSTOMISATION - I LOVE THIS\ninteresting hero system\nNice animations in diplomacy scenes\nReasonably polished game\nFun questing system that you don't see in many similar games\nNice faction creation\nNice sovereign creation\nNice spells which can be cast both in and out of combat\n\nCon's\nquite buggy - however they have patched several of the bugs recently\nSometimes in combat UI it is unclear which unit you are controlling\nSomewhat irrational AI opponents\nLimited diplomacy options - can't sell cities and treaties are limited\nSometimes the enemy can gain a massive boost in power for no apparent reason\nVery similar to other fantasy strategy games\nLimited number of quests from what I've seen - I've seen the same quests on different levels\n\nConclusion:\nI really enjoy this game, it has fun combat, decent AI and enjoyable strategy elements however the bugs are a massive pain and the diplomacy options - or lack thereof - are very annoying.","June 11, 2014","true","106.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

LH is a more polished game, true, but there is really not much difference. The nations, heroes and units are all ported over. The differences to me are not enough to justify the price tag.

But, because of the problems, its very below those 2 games.\n\nStill, its a very addictive game. It has so much potential that let you thinking why the hell Stardock decided to no deliver a more polished game. It could be a 9/10 game if it had done so.

How about real strategy and management? Investing time into a game instead of rushing through it? This is the game. I recommend this game 100%. I haven't played much, but I got the idea of the game in a short period of time. Don't believe me? Watch videos and read other reviews.","January 2, 2015","true","25.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game takes some working ideas from Civilization and Galactic Civilizations and merges them with  Heroes of Might and Magic. It brings some new ideas as well and most of them are good innovations. Beware that strategic management is extremely simplified compared to Civ, but still a lot more significant than in HoMaM. The game isn´t balanced very well, but will provide challenge for up-to average gamers. Over all it´s a game that mixes the genres well and I recommend it, as long as you like TBS at least a little and you already played HoMaM and Civ games: 70%.\nPros:\n•	spell power based on shards and other novelty ideas\n•	army and hero system better than in HoMaM IV\n•	good mix of strategy and tactics\n•	unit design is much better then Civ IV or GalCiv 2\n•	leader and faction design - each faction plays differently\n•	tech trading and diplomacy is executed well\nCons:\n•	bad spell user interface in strategic view\n•	on bigger maps sequence of events on start of turn is chaotic\n•	major bad design is harmless (from monsters) AI pioneers and cities, so AI takes all resources very fast and builds cities near dragons, this is GalCiv2 handwriting and persistent error from StarDock. Please see Civ IV to see how impassable borders can work with expanding AI.\n•	sometimes buggy mouse behavior in tactical\n•	no hall of fame to record the result of past games\n•	reasearch is not very well balanced or thought out\nOther:\n•	graphics and sound are average but suitable for a low-budget TBS game\n•	the game does provide some single-player scenarios (not as deep as HoMaM by far), but focus is on random maps like Civ\n","February 5, 2015","true","67.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I neds to be fixed up, but it offers a decent fantasy style Civilization. Easy to play, and learn as well.\n\nSad though that the navies are not in game. It needs water-based units.","February 12, 2015","true","96.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
