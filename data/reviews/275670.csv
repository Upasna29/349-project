I enjoy the premise and I enjoy Tower Defense style games, but I don't find micromanaging turrets any fun. If they add in a tactical pause option I may find myself going back to those levels and changing my review accordingly. If you happen to enjoy that sort of gameplay mechanic you will probably enjoy the games later levels, but if not I really couldn't recommend the game. There is also the problem of gamebreaking bugs, see below for details here. That is the short summary of why I can't recommend the game personally. For further details keep reading.\n\nPros\n\n+Great premise which freshens the stale Tower Defense genre.\n+Voice acting is generally humerous.\n+Variety of turrets/upgrades is relatively small, but generally each feel unique.\n\nCons\n\n-Micromanaging turrets, which may be a plus for some people but not for me. Also, here a tactical pause would alleviate this con.\n-Gamebreaking bugs, after my 6 or so hours playing the game the game froze and or exited to windows a dozen times. This usually happened when a new unit was introduced and then it would freeze/exit and I would then have to start all over on that level.\n-Turrets/Upgrades while unique feeling would benefit from more upgrades or options. Also, the idea that all the later turrets take up more space on the ship and thus generally undoing what benefits the stronger turret gave.\n\nThat is the overview of the game, in my opinion. I will update my review, if/when they update patch fixes for the tactical pause and gamebreaking bugs.","June 28, 2014","false","6.1"," 285 of 379 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","285","379","0","14"

After you've realized that this is not the case and you're given a specific ship template per storyline mission, you then think: "Well, even without the sandbox ability to create your own ship, the missions do get progressively harder and you do get cool upgrades as the game progresses."  You then realize, that there are only 5 different types of missions and the upgrades become less relevant after completing all of the weapon upgrades.\n\nMid-way into the game, you start to get frustrated by how unforgiving and repetitive the missions are and it simply becomes a memorization game where you memorize where the waves come first and plan accordingly to achieve the much desired 5 star rating. You start to rely on hotkeys to fend of waves of new enemies that come in every 10 seconds and you have no time to pause the game (no pause button) or just look at your ship in great detail. Only at the end of the mission, do you have any time to realize the beauty of your ship, but by that time you're so frustrated that you just want to get to the next mission.\n\nIn the end, I had to view walk-through videos for the last 5 missions since I was simply tired of memorizing when each wave comes in and when to build what structures at what locations accordingly. The upgrades became worthless after the last 10 missions since your guns do not get stronger, but the enemy gets tougher and more numerous.\n\nOverall, it was a cool looking game and a good concept. However, I don't think it was a good idea to leave out the sandbox ability of building your own ships and how tough the time limits are for the 5 star missions.","January 16, 2015","false","26.4"," 162 of 204 people (79%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","79","162","204","5","0"

You build onto free hexes on your ship, as you fly towards your goal, and try to defend yourself and your cargo from a constant barrage of enemies. Competently amusing story-dialogues, and genuinely exciting bossfights spice it up rather nicely.\n\nThe challenge is derived from the way the game forces you to split your considerations while managing a limited budget: You must choose between weapons, defenses, engines, and other specific needs based on the "client" you are running the mission for. Focusing on firepower is easy enough, but youll lose speed and get a lower score, which limits your tech-tree advancement. Focusing on speed will get you killed. Choosing the right pieces, at the right times, is vital to getting the best outcome. This becomes more difficult as the game advances, because larger/more-advanced constructions require various levels of power, and because components must be built adjacent to each other in certain ways to function.\n\nIf I had to complain about anything in this game, it would be that there is no "free-play" or "random" mode. Only the campaign exists, and there is no variance within said campaign. Once you have played all of the levels once, all there is to do is to go back and play them each again, and try to get a higher score. The game ended, for me, before I was ready to put it away, and I was sad to see that no expansions or DLC exist to get more playtime out of it.\n\nBut, to say that a game was good enough that it left me wanting more is a compliment in its own right. Definitely worth the price at 15 dollars, and maybe worth more.","May 28, 2015","true","23.3"," 57 of 62 people (92%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","92","57","62","3","0"

I was under the impression the ships would be customizable.\n\nThere's also this whole "race against the clock" factor present on each level, but if I put all of your money into engines (speed improvements), the stage doesn't seem to end any faster, and I just get cut up by all the enemies I'm unable to kill. No dead enemies = no more money. Seems like the developer designed a perfect layout for each stage and then tailored the enemies to that build.

I have a lot of games and I enjoyed this one but I have also paid less for more on other titles. I'm not saying it's a bad deal or the price is a major issue I just think it should probably be a few bucks cheaper.\n-Dialogue and story are basically non existent. Just a few text boxes and a shallow plot. Some of the jokes are funny in a cheesy way but I found myself skipping through a lot of it.\n-Not enough big ships. The game gives you a smaller playingh field than most TD games which makes  you have to change your towers often especially at later levels. This is fine but it would have been cool to have a few more late game ships of a bigger size I think.\n\n\nAll in all I do recommend Space Run and had a very fun time w/it. Tower defense on rails was an interesting concept and one that worked well for the developers. I hope the game ended up profitting as little games like these often get sequels and I wouldn't mind hauling cargo through the galaxy again IF it were on a larger scale next time.","February 20, 2015","true","26.9"," 49 of 60 people (82%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","82","49","60","3","0"

We cannot get through this level because the game crashes during or right before the boss fight.

As you pour your earnings back into technology and upgrades for your ship, the jobs you successfully complete will increase your reputation, which will let you earn even more. Meanwhile, your android business partner will give you helpful advice and constantly let you know how badly you are doing at any given moment along your runs.\n\nThis game is a great little twist on tower defense that has you fitting out spaceships in order to hold cargo, passengers, engines, and of course, weapons. As you carry your cargo from one space dock to the next, your ship will be attacked by other ships, pirates, and asteroids. You can mine resources from the scraps of the stuff you destroy on the trip, and that lets you build and upgrade more weapons and engine power.\n\nThere are a lot of different components involved, and figuring out how to best layout your ship's "deck" with the stuff you need to take is definitely a challenge. To add to the challenge, you generally launch with very little equipment in play and you have to add the rest on the fly (literally).\n\nMy only complaint is that weapons have a limited wedge of fire and rotating the turrets manually can be a bit tedious in the midst of a pitched battle.\n\nOverall, Space Run is a lot of fun.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/AdamMil/recommended/275670/","AdamMil","Adam","http://steamcommunity.com/id/AdamMil/","240 products in account","This game starts out quite fun but there's one glaring flaw that prevents me from being able to recommend it at full price.\n\nFirst I'll mention some of the positives. The game is an innovative entry into the tower defense genre with a very hands-on style. (Significant micromanagement is required at some points, however, so this may be a turn-off.) The graphics, sound, and music are good, certainly more than adequate to the task. The mission types are rather varied, with there being four distinct types of cargo that pose different challenges. (Technically there are five, but two are almost identical.) The game also has a good sense of humor.\n\nOn the minus side, some parts of the game require significant micromanagement to activate the various special abilities of all your turrets, and it can be difficult sometimes to locate the specific turret you need in a hurry. There are also numerous spelling and grammatical errors in the game text, but it remains understandable.\n\nBut the biggest problem by far is that as the levels become more difficult, they require prescience to beat, but the game has an inadequate warning system and no mechanism for rewinding time except restarting the whole level. The effect is that you'll start a mission, and since you can't afford to build guns and defenses in all directions you'll have to build them only in the directions from which threats will come. And generally you won't find out until it's too late that you needed, for instance, anti-missile defense in a particular direction. So you start over and shuffle things around so you have enough money to build the anti-missile defense at the right time. Then you find out that you need a shield or a missile launcher in some other direction, but only too late, so you start over again. I suppose if you don't care about your reputation then it doesn't matter, but if you want to achieve the "fast and safe delivery" then you'll have to restart the harder missions a bunch of times. This whole problem could have been avoided if the game included a checkpoint system like Defense Grid or a warning system that gave more detailed information about the threats.\n\nAs a result, the game becomes a bit of a drag once you're about two thirds of the way through, and that's why I can't recommend it at full price. I do recommend picking it up on sale, though. You'll probably get about 12 hours of fun and 8 hours of somewhat less fun gameplay.","November 7, 2015","false","17.0"," 31 of 42 people (74%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","74","31","42","0","0"

Maybe it's because I aim for full stars every run, but still. You do unlock items and grind credits to buy them, but that's where the reward system ends - and on many runs you can't even utilise the advanced stuff because the basic cannons will still be your best option! The game just seems poorly designed in the later parts, it does not flow or play well.\n\nI bought the game because I liked the idea and the voiceacting and dialogue, but there is no plot to carry the latter and the "idea" was not what I thought it was. I wanted to build ships, not obsessively micromanage them, and I was hoping for some fun times, not this extreme timing challenge stuff. Note: you do not "build" a ship so much as get shoved onto a pre-formed platform that you can slap parts onto by grinding credits during a run.\n\nIf you want to challenge yourself with a glorified mobile game then this is for you - but why would you do that? For me it was not fun after the start and hence not what I wanted. An afternoon's fun was not worth the asking price; I wish there had been a demo (and next time I will "borrow a demo" before I buy this stuff).","April 3, 2015","false","5.5"," 36 of 55 people (65%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","65","36","55","3","0"

The game consists of starting at a port, accepting a delivery assignment, buying upgrades, launching your ship, then racing from the starting point to the destination with your deliveries intact, while defending your ship against asteroids and other ships and drones that you'll pass along your way. You'll acquire currency for upgrades and repairs by mousing-over floating golden nuts which appear in space after things are destroyed.\n\nOnce you reach your destination, you'll have rather long dialog scenes with your ship's droid, CEOs of the companies you are delivering cargo for, and others. These have a basic level of humor, but can drag on for a bit too long. Fortunately, they are fully voiced, which makes a big difference. If you were forced to click through these long bits of text, otherwise, it would detract a lot from the overall game.\n\nIf you're a big fan of tower defense games, this is worth checking out.","September 5, 2014","true","1.0"," 14 of 19 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","14","19","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/frumple99/recommended/275670/","frumple99","frumple","http://steamcommunity.com/id/frumple99/","151 products in account","Space Run is a hybrid Tower Defense game, and a pretty good one. It's actually closer to space games/shooters in style but with the mechanics of a TD game. You're put in charge of corporate cargo ships and tasked with making a dangerous delivery. The ships themselves are made up of hexagonal cells (in a different configuration each time) onto which modules can be placed. These modules include the cargo you're carrying and one engine which you build before takeoff and the rest you build along the way.\n\nThe game does a good job of quickly getting you up to speed and explaining how different modules behave or what placement restrictions they may have. For example engines require a free space behind them, while turrets may require up to several free spaces ahead of them.\n\nYou gain construction points slowly over time or by collecting scrap leftover from destroyed asteroids, hostile fighters or larger vessels. This way you put together a fearsome (hopefully) and quick (allegedy) ship that can take on whatever you may encounter (citation needed). It's possible to recycle modules to free up space, recover resources or re-arrange the ship.\n\nIn between missions new modules of various kinds become available for purchase. Modules can also be upgraded to unlock new abilities or improvements. Bits of storyline dialogue also take place here. The story isn't all that much of a much, but it's not bad either. Some of the dialogues are contrived though.\n\nOverall it's a pretty nice concept. You build the ship from bits and pieces, hoping to use starting resources to cover the right flanks against initial attackers/asteroids and cursing the cargo modules or the wonky ship configuration. Though you don't know which way danger is coming from, you get an early warning and some time to adapt. Spend cash on upgrades, take a new job, rinse and repeat.\n\n\nMy biggest problem was that the game was fun in short bursts. Either that or i just wasn't hooked enough to keep playing after a few missions. It would draw me back after a time, so that's good. Regardles, it was a bit tricky to pick up where i left off. Previous missions are still available though.\n\nAt first i wasn't a huge fan of fast paced building, rebuilding, repairing and using a multitude of special abilities. I'd be more comfortable if i was allowed to be a slug and play at a glacial pace. Perhaps it's just as well that Space Run gives me a jolt to take me out of my comfort zone. Your mileage may vary but i think that's a good thing. From time to time. Normally i think i could write a tome of memoires, sketch ideas for ship builds and make a presentation with fancy charts and graphs, plus write some fanfic before i finished a turn of Sword of the Stars. SOTS is pretty fast for a 4X TBS, I'm THAT slow.\n\nBeing a cleverly disguised Tower Defence game, Space Run plays quite quickly and requires balancing several things at once. Usually while facing increasingly difficult attacks as the mission goes on. Not only is it important to deploy weapons to cover your vessel, you'll also want to invest in engines. Engines cost you resources and give little in return, but speed is the only way to outrun the competition and that multiplies your final payment. In addition, there is the cargo on board, and it's wise to protect it with shields. This will divert your resources away from firepower and take up valuable space on board. And then on top of that, some modules require power generators adjacent to them.\n\nDoing all this requires a mix of planning ahead (where to place thrusters, cargo, shields etc.), and quick wits under fire that will seriously challenge your multi-tasking competence (adjusting arcs on turrets, activating special abilities of shields and generators, rebuilding destroyed stuff, etc.).\n\nThis is why ultimately, Space Run wins my respect. It makes what i described above fun to do, which i didn't really think would happen. As i said, i'm not a fan of Tower Defense nor RTS. It's not easy, but it's a good challenge, fun concept and the game is polished and well presented. Sure the voice acting could be better but i think only with a major league professional actor and a major league fee. Plus i enjoyed some of the voices.\n\nArtwork is very nice and shiny while the music doesn't really pop but isn't offensive or annoying either. It does the job. Some of the character portraits didn't really hit home with me but that's just a personal preference. 3D models are cartoony enough to be fun and serious enough to not look stupid. Overall nothing about the game felt lazy or bland.\n\nIf i had to nitpick to find flaws, i'd say maybe it would be nice to have the ability to zoom in a bit closer, but it's fine. The icons in the construction menu DO need text labels, but i got the hang of it.\n\n\nRecommended! If you're affraid of real time multitasking, it could go either way. It won me over, but you might get frustrated quickly. If you're a fan of Tower Defense, you'll be right at home.","January 30","true","5.7"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","11","15","0","0"

You’ll spend your time lining up your weapons and powering your thrusters all to protect your cargo and make it to the end to collect your pay. It does this beautifully by fusing an unlock system both during delivery and between deliveries all while begging you to think ahead while the alarms are screaming that another set of enemies are on their way.\n\nThe unlock system is impressive. It features laser guns, rockets, point defense, shields, disabling cannons, warp drives, healing generators and each of these has a variety of special attacks and moves. You might for example enjoy a laser gun that can be reoriented over one that has an incredible rate of fire. It also pairs nicely with the games 30 deliveries. When you finish missions you’ll be given money depending on your score. You can use that to purchase or upgrade existing weapons. As you unlock new weapons you also unlock new deliveries with unusual and often times very hazardous cargo that could explode or shut off your shields. This means that the entire time you’ll play Space Run the game will be ramping up the complexity. By the end you’ll be able to appreciate going from just a ship with three or so lasers and some thrusters to fighting hundreds of enemies with dozens of ship defenses all while under the clock.\n\nThe clock and indeed the overall method and means by which you plan is worth giving Space Run a shot. It asks you to look at your ship, anticipate where attacks are coming from, put your cargo and defenses in way to defend them both from the immediate threat of incoming ships and the long term ability to fend off future attacks. But this isn’t just some planning game. As I mentioned before all your weapons have special abilities. You will have to get used to running your ship to defend yourself. You’re not merely watching a well planned defense, you’re executing it.\n\nWhich leads me to the sticking points. For example you might beautifully crush all your forward facing opponents but then found you’ve spent all your resources and are now unable to defend yourself from the rear. Or you might have proved an excellent defense but unable to make your delivery in time. This is of course is fine and certainly better than being too easy but the game has a tendency for deadly “gotcha” moments. Retrying with a different setup is often fun but eventually it loses it’s charm. You’re not given the opportunity to immediately try again. You’re given the opportunity in about 3:00. It’s short but it definitely could use some check points. I do have to say however knowing the level means knowing the route which does seem thematically appropriate.\n\nIf you like short puzzlers with a good dose of action and planning then you’ll have fun with this one.

The intrigue comes down to how and where you place them as you place them in diffferent directions to cover particular directions the enemies come from (conviently, 6 directions). As you fly through space you encounter meteriods and pirates which attempt to damage modules and cargo. You also get some passive trucker ships (which oddly enough, you blast out the sky.. no reason given). In the end you are given a rating on how fast the delivery was and the state of the cargo you were suppose to deliver. More cargo delivered faster = more cash to spend on building upgrades to the modules you make.\nThe result is a rather satisfying TD, where you get the urge to go back to give it another try so see if you could do it better this time round.\n\nThere's a number of small faults. It's mostly just lacking some polish in this regard.\n-Don't expect anything in the form of a story. The voicing is good and the script has a cheesey humour, but aside from that there's little tale to tell.\n-Missions are scripted. All of them. Which this gives way for for some decent level design, the way the game plays feels akin to FTL and thus it lends itself to being roguelike. There isn't a randomised gametype or any sort so there's a lot of replayability going to waste here.\n- Similar to FTL, you aim weapons and power shields as and when you need them. FTL has a tactical pause that allows you to issue all the orders simultaniously. However, in space run, you are expected to micromanage you modules' orientations and active abilities on the fly. While this increases the pacing, the module based system can make this process somewhat fiddly and can cause mistakes that make you restart you ten minute pefect run.\n\nIf you're a fan of TD games, it's worth a look at in it's current state. If the developers decide to apply the polish, I would recommend this to anyone else, especially the rouguelike fans.","July 2, 2014","true","12.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Space Run is one of those games, as it turns tower defense on its head by casting you as running cargo through hostile sectors while controlling a ship that can convert resources ("hexnuts") into additional generators, shields, weaponry, engines, and the like.  The end result barely looks like tower defense at all, but manages to capture the best parts of the genre while possibly creating something even better.\n\nIn the most basic sense, it's a game about placing things on hexagons to survive various attacking threats.  However, this game goes far beyond the basics, and delivers a rock-solid good balance and great presentation.

Space Run is a fantastic addition to the genre.  As with any great tower defense game, there is a delicate balance of resources and tower types, and in the case of Space Run, it goes a few layers deeper (see below).  Instead of protecting the exit or in the case of Defense Grid for example, power orbs, the emphasis is on your space cargo.  Structures and shield generators can be used to shield the cargo from enemy forces.  All towers receive active and passive upgrades through in game credits earned from completing missions.  In addition to safeguarding your cargo and taking out waves of enemies encroaching on your ship, your delivery rating is based on how fast you got to the destination (this is separate from the cargo arriving intact).  This is based on the amount of thrust the ship has (based on the number and type of thrusters).  I also forgot to mention that many of the towers types can be rotated to improve their effectiveness.  This is crucial early on in most missions to maximize income for the mid to late game of a specific mission.  The average length of a mission is 5-10 minutes and is a ton of fun.  I suggest that anyone who enjoys games like Defense Grid, Sol Survivor, Prime World: Defenders, and Kingdom Rush give Space Run a try.","July 8, 2014","true","19.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","2"

You take your hex-grid and enemy waves attack it with something like a 30 second warning of the next wave's composition and path. Blowing up enemies gets you a resource which you can then use to build turrets or activate special powers of existing turrets. You also get a constant basic income, so, while it is possible to screw up badly enough to get shot down, you can't screw up to prevent yourself from being able to build (though you may not be able to build in time).\n\nThere's a good array of offensive, defensive and support modules to unlock and unlock powers for - completing a run earns you currency, which you can spend to unlock upgrades and new buildable modules.\n\nWeaponry comes as missiles, which are high damage, can be intercepted, but can be built anywhere, and lasers, which have to be built overhanging the edge of the ship, and do less damage, but are harder to block. Then there are ion guns which just shut down enemy modules temporarily (which is much quicker than destroying them through damage) and, like lasers, have to be built on the edge of your ship.\n\nShields have to be powered (usually by building them next to power generators) but protect several hexes around them from all damage while they last, and regenerate automatically.\n\nEngines have to stick out of the back of your ship, and control how long the flight takes - finishing a given course within a set time gives you a bigger payoff; be too slow and you get nothing. The game does a good job of showing you whether you need more engines to qualify for a given bonus or will collect it if nothing disrupts your engines.\n\nPower generators provide power to the adjacent hexes, allowing advanced modules and module powers to operate.\n\nEach type of module comes in several versions, with the basic version taking up just the one hex and often not requiring power for standard operation, while more advanced equivalents will take up multiple hexes and require (more) power in order to do anything. Balancing space and power requirements is a key part of later runs, and where the game shines.\n\n\nThe bad:\n\nThe game does reward successful micromanagement - and some of the later runs require it. That's not a bad thing in itself, but it is when the controls are occasionally sluggish and unresponsive. Having to repeat mouse-clicks three or four times to get them to register in the midle of an intense fire-fight makes a big difference to the outcome. I can understand not wanting to go down the pausable real time route, but if you require the player to input their decisions in real time, then the game needs to reliably accept that input in real time\n\nIf you mis-position a module when building, your only option is to wait precious seconds for it to finish building, dismantle it to free the space and get back some of the resource investment, and then rebuild it in the right space. Again, not a bad thing in itself - if the user makes a mistake, it's fair enough for them to have to pay some sort of penalty - but in this game, whenever an engine comes online, the entire play area moves suddenly - if you're lucky, the module you were about to place is now in an illegal position and nothing happens; if you're unlocky, you've just put the right module in the wrong position and have to face the penalty.\n\nNeither of these is a fundamental design flaw - though the degree of micromanagement required may not be to everyone's taste - but they are real problems with the game.\n\n\nThe other stuff:\n\nThe game gets compared to the boardgame Galaxy Trucker - in fact, that's how I first came to hear of it. Yes, there are things both games have in common, and it's easy to believe that this game was partly inspired by the board game, but there are also enough differences, and significant enough differences that this isn't just Galaxy Trucker: the Video Game. That said, there's enough overlap that if you enjoy one, there's a good chance you'll enjoy the other.","September 9, 2014","true","11.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

As you'll see in a lot of reviews, Space Run plays like a tower defense game.  For all intents and purposes this is true, but rather than trying to channel your enemies into traps, or choke points, you have to setup your ship to deal with enemies from possibly any direction (though your radar gives you fair warning of where the baddies are coming from).\n\n\nFor anyone on the fence, here's my list of Pros and Cons\n\nPROS:\n- It's quite easy to install and get right into the action with this game.  The information and pop ups on things that happen for the first time are designed well and not excessive (so restarting a level won't make you redo a help window).\n- It's a great puzzle-based tower defense game.  Sometimes you can attack a run with all offense, other times you have to take a defensive position... and in the most fun, a combination of both is often required where you have to decommission a turret to make room for something more appropriate for the upcoming enemy.\n- Even the lower level turrets come in handy in the later levels.  With most tower defense games, once you are able to pick up the better weapons the "entry" weapons loose their value.  Not so in Space Run.  Based on ship design, the direction/type of enemies coming at you etc., "entry" weapons are actually better options than the beefier ones.  It's a nice way to balance out the game and make you plan your run accordingly.\n- Great Voice Acting for an Indie title.  Seriously, bad voice acting can quickly take away from a game.  Thankfully the good voice acting actually you around looking for more.  While you can skip the dialogs, I found myself enjoying the scripted banter between our hero and the various characters he deals with.\n\nCons:\n- There's not enough turrets.  There are basically 3 types of each turret, which are guns, missiles, defensive (anti-misslles and anti-turret cannons), shields, engines, and power plants.  I'd love to see more variety and weapons, but it is an indie game after all, and the lack of options will arguably add to he difficulty of the later runs.\n- Money is easy to get.  I think a lot of the negative reviews stem from the MISTAKE that you have to pick a playing style and go with it.  Frankly, I'd rather that be the case.  If you don't feel like you're equipped enough to make a run, quite and replay a run you've already completed to get more money and upgrade your turrets.  Fame and Money limit your ability to upgrade turrets, but money is easily earned (by replaying missions) and your fame level at the 2/3 mark is sufficient to unlock everything.\n- Once you play a mission, you know the mission.  It's fun to replay a mission and try different turret combinations/combos, but the level really is unchanged.  You encounter the same enemies at the same time that use the same weapons, etc.  I would have loved to see some level of random enemy generation, but I understand why the developers didn't take this approach.\n\n\nAll things considered this is game about strategy.  How do you setup your turrets?  How do you configure them, etc?  Yes, there are times when you have to activate a turret's abilities at a key time, but if that weren't the case, you'd basically be looking at a screen watching enemies get wiped out (or alternatively wiping out your ship)? If you want that, save the money and head over to youtube.  If you find yourself devolving into turret management, than you're approaching the level wrong.  Try something different, each run presents different challenges, so take the opportunity and try different tactics.\n\nMy rating: 4/5\n\nI think the Metacritic score is a touch low, but it's a fun game worth picking up, especially if you can catch it on sale.  Just be warned that you will easily find yourself losing hours trying to figure out the best way through a run.","September 18, 2014","true","25.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

As if that weren't enough, you have to balance speed (one more engine) with defense (one more shield) and aggressive defense (one more weapon).\nThose decisions are made on your hex-based ship, different weapons, defenses, engines and generators feeding the former  having increasingly complicated shapes to fit. It's all about finding the right combination of modules in the right places at the right times.\nIn your first tries, you may fail, but later come back with a vengeance, after having reinvested your earnings for fast and possibly safe delivery of goods into the newest technology upgrades. Still, especially the later missions will keep you occupied for quite a while.\nFor the perfectionists, there's a good 30 hours of gameplay, until you unlocked every achievement, doing everything perfectly.\n\nDefinitely recommended.","September 23, 2014","true","38.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Given a ship, a cargo, and an engine, the player constructs weapons, shields and many other devices as needed, all constrained by the limitation of space that the hexagons of the ship represent.\n\nThe feeling of flight, of speed is palpable, as the ship soars past planets and asteroid fields, threatened from all sides by every manner of trouble. Pirate ships, tumbling rocks, and even other space truckers all present either a danger, or an opportunity to make cash on the side.\n\nThe goal is to protect the cargo and deliver it as quickly as possible - the faster, the better the payoff. But there are strategies that pay well in doddling too, and there are times when it is sensible to hunker down, and times when putting everything into engines is better. It is the diversity of choices, and the continual unlocking of new weapons, shields and engines that make the game entrancing.\n\nCultural and media references abound - there are nods to everything from Red Dwarf and Blake's Seven to Babylon 5, and more.\n\nAbove all, the game is just plain fun. I highly recommend it as a light, enjoyable diversion. Each run takes about ten to fifteen minutes, making it ideal for a quick break or that waiting time before dinner.\n\nThis is a casual, but not unchallenging game, that holds a lot of fun in a small package.\n\nIt is worth the price.\n","June 17, 2014","true","13.8"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Space Run offers a unique combination of space tactics, tower defense, and arcade combat systems.\n\nStory:\nYou play a rather cocky captain Buck Mann, a space runner, whose mission is to deliver goods across the universe. He normally doesn’t chase the credits, but some debits with the notorious gangsters has caused a change of heart. Buck is given a chance to by Big Cargo executive Susan to delivery some highly important cargo. This first mission unlocks the opportunity to prove himself as a reputable Space Runner. As the deliveries continue Buck Mann gains new clients Nuclear Star, VIP Travel, Out of This World, and AI Squared. Can he make all the deliveries and become the best Space Running in the Galaxy?\n\nCampaign:\nThe campaign is composed of 30-missions, each company offers Buck Mann six missions each. Throughout each of your clients you’ll face ever stronger foes and have to fight off fearsome pirate lords: Captain Black and Brownbeard the Pirate. Not only do you have to fight off meddlesome pirates, but you need to protect your ship through asteroid belts and ever more deadly cargo. The campaign is ever changing as every mission new enemies and challenges are introduced keeping the game fresh and entertaining.\n\nGameplay:\nSpace Run plays like a traditional tower defense, in that you place turrets in your base and they target enemies without your control. Each tower has special abilities you can unlock with can give you a higher degree of control over them. Every tower has its usage and you’ll notice as you play you will be switching out between them continuously. A mixture of anti-ballistic missile systems, machine gun turrets, mass rocket launchers, super shields, engines that can control the space-time-continuum, and much more. This game has a fantastic difficulty curve from Easy to Hard offering gaming for all player-types. Hard is more difficult and will require repeat plays to get 5-star while on the other hand easy is so simple you can gun through it on one run and get a perfect game.\n\nHints:\n>Anti-ballistic missile systems are going to be incredibly useful and in-fact may be more important than your shields.\n>The maximum laser turret is worth every penny and if you place them right you won’t need to worry about other laser turrets.\n>In order to get 5-stars you will need all the engine upgrades.\n>Play this game on easy for achievements, as you are not limited by difficulty.\n>Make sure your ship has got lots of engines early on boss levels, as they stop your ship in its tracks. If you are not far enough ahead of the timer you will get pulled behind and lose the 5-star rating.\n\nResults:\nSpace Run is an incredibly interesting new take onto Tower Defense games that puts high speed micro-managing with unique map concepts to provide a fantastic gaming experience. Each map requires speed as well as a protecting cargo which requires proper management of the player’s resources. The unique bosses pose new threats not just on the players cargo, but they also stop the player meaning if he/she is not far enough ahead of the timer they may get pulled back and lose the 5-star delivery. If you like Tower Defense Games, like micromanaging, enjoy space combat, or want a unique gaming experience then Space Run is the game for you. I definitely recommend this game and based on how you play it you can easily get 10-20 hours of gameplay out of it before repeating yourself.\n\nPros:\n+Unique enemies that keep the game interesting.\n+Interesting ship dynamics and management.\n+Loads of engineering upgrades and abilities.\n+Awesome boss battles and strategies.\n+Clean graphics and smooth user interface.\n+Fast paced space simulator with highly diversified playing methods.\n+Smooth difficulty curve – made for all players.\n+Cargo dynamics that require the player to have to play in unique ways.\n\nCons:\n-Sadly no survival mode.\n-Turrets almost always annoyingly target enemy ship engines rather than their weaponry. Seeing as Engines do nothing for enemy ships it almost always results in your turrets getting beat up a lot more than they need to.\n-Enemy EMP weapon seem to always seem to switch targets while your EMP weapons shoot the same thing over and over. Result is all your systems are down and the enemy only has an engine down.","October 26, 2014","true","17.7"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

On these you can build propulsion devices, weapons, shield, generators or place your cargo. On each mission your ship flies automatically from A to B (faster if you build more engines) in real-time, and you have to defend your cargo and your ship from being destroyed by enemy ships and asteroids, which can come from 360&deg;. Destroying them brings you resources which you need to build more devices.\n\nSo, is it any good?\nOh yes, it is. It is actually great. In the first missions you have only a few devices and a small ship. Later the ships get larger, the devices get bigger and need more energy, so you have to place bigger generators next to them. That might sound a bit cumbersome, but it is not. The game leads you from mission to mission to the more complex setups, and you can choose in which order you unlock new devices and upgrades. Later missions are difficult and a little grinding is necessary from time to time, but the balancing of the game is very well made, so they never feel unfair.\n\nWhat about game length and replayability?\nThere are about 30 missions to do. There are achievements, which are a must these days. You can replay all missions to get a better rating and to unlock new devices or upgrades (=grind). Considering the price, that is more than fair.\n\nObviously this is a recommendation. Any criticism?\nThis qualifies as an Indie game. So in regards of graphics, music and sound design, you can expect solid work, but nothing extraordinary. The story is pretty basic and generic: acerbic trucker and android sidekick quarrel with pirates. Voice acting was good. The game can get rather hectic, and the design of some of the devices makes it hard to keep track of everything: A few times I built the mid size shield and not the mid size generator, or forgot to build a missile defence, because I saw too late that the enemy ship had a missile launcher. Enemies and asteroids can come from 360&deg; degrees, but in most mission they do not. But even when replaying, you have to remember the directions.\n\nFinal Verdict?\nI really enjoyed the game and gladly recommend it. I am looking forward to the sequel. 4,5/5=9/10","March 16","true","31.2"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

You're building stuff on your ship that's made of hexagonal platforms, placing turrets, engines, containers, power generators and many more. Your goal is to make it to the end while fending off enemy attacks and protecting yourself from asteroids and other stellar phenomena. Basically, it's a quite clever and original tower defense.\n\nSounds great on paper, but I only ended up frustrated. Later levels are impossible to perfect without preparing way ahead to what's to come. The interface seems like it was made for a mobile device, even though - to my knowledge - the game is not available on any mobile platform.

Add to that the fact the visuals, music and sound effects are bland and boring, and that the storyline tries so hard to be funny it ends up being cringeworthy, and you've got yourself just a mediocre game.\n\nYou might find more fun here than I did, especially if you're not a "perfectionist" when it comes to this genre. Personally, I ended up disappointed.","February 1","false","5.5"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

There's just too much going on.  You have to micromanage every single turret to make sure they are facing the right direction, then there's a very small margin of error with your turret placements so one mistake could cost you the game, and you have to do all this while racing the clock to make your delivery.\n\nPlus most levels you have to play twice just to beat it once. 1st try is to see the enemy waves and the 2nd try is to be prepared for them.

Hands down. It takes a traditional concept and puts an interesting spin on it.\n\nThe goal of the game is to make deliveries with a customizable space ship for different companies. Each of those has a different gimmick you have to take into account when doing a mission. Apart from the first company which is kind of generic, but for which you can earn extra money in the later levels if you're good enough. You can skip the story, however. Your ship consists of hexagonal tiles on which you can place various modules. Each module fulfills a different role (separated into offense, defense and power/engines) and can be upgraded 3 times. The visuals are pretty nice actually and game play is fun if you like thinking on the fly and adjusting to situations. You WILL have to micro manage quite a bit in this game, so take that into account before buying it. If you do not like this, then you will not like the game. Period. For all others it is worth the money though.\n\nPros:\n- Nice 3D visuals for a 15 € title.\n- Engaging and interesting game play. Instead of defending a portal or whatever from thousands of minions you have to protect your cargo, which can be individually attacked from marauding pirates.\n- Enemy variety is pretty decent as well.\n- On the fly thinking with micro management\n- Lots of different upgrades, modules and strategies\n- Trade-off system (You can't just build bigger and stronger guns without a trade-off, i.e. require more space, more power and can't do stuff cheaper modules can. Best example is the guns. You can rotate your level 1 guns and increase their fire rate, but they generally do not do much damage, your level 2 guns, do A TON of damage, but can only be placed in certain angles to your ship, which gives them a very limited fire solution, but you can "delink" the towers to fire in 2 separate directions. Your biggest gun takes a lot of space and does the most damage, but it can only fire on a fixed location. You will usually only ever have 1 of them at the location where the heavies opposition is coming from. Furthermore you need quite a bit of power and you need at least a tier 2 shield generator to permanently encase them in a protective shield)\n- Actually good voice actin\n- There is almost no "progress wall". You can repeat missions as often as you like and get the money from it again, which means that you can buy all the upgrades eventually if you think you need them. Some of them are locked behind the "rating stars" you get for each mission. You can't accumulate those, but so far I have gotten the maximum number of stars for each mission (I have 7 left...I think it's 35-40 in total) and have never encountered a problem here. Of course you will have to complete missions in order to progress to new missions...\n- Good value (should take you about 10-15 hours to finish depending on luck and skill)\n- Polished product. No bugs or freezes encountered in about 10 hours game play.\n\nCons:\n- There is no pause mode. The game can become pretty hectic, but I suppose this is deliberate. You have to think and act quick\n- In line with the above it can get VERY confusing to actually find all your modules in a pinch situation and activate the correct ability\n- There is no auto save or quick save option. If you fail you have to go from the start again.\n- The story is presented in boring dialogues. The voice acting is good, but there really is no reason to listen to it I'm afraid. You talk to your android co-pilot, your employers and the 2 pirates in the game. All of them have a unique personality (including yourself) which is presented a bit over the top (almost trying too hard, but that is again probably deliberate).\n- The cutscenes need to be skippable. Every time you start a mission you have to watch your take off again. But the real annoyance comes in the form of the pirate leaders, who get ridiculously long and annoying cutscenes, which you cannot skip completely. You can only skip the dialogue one by one...\n- You cannot save a ship layout. Every time you fail you will have to create it anew.\n- Trial and error is involved.\n\nSummary: If you like hectic and unique TD games with a space setting that require micro management, on the fly thinking, good planning AND learning the missions more or less by hard before getting 5 stars and all cargo through (I am looking at you VIP Travel) then this game is for you and the money spent is well invested. If not, then do not buy it and post negative reviews.","July 5, 2014","true","17.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I like the story and the ship setup, but find that it gets grindy to level you turrets and such up.  I'm also not a fan of how click happy it is.  Constantly moving turrets around or reangling them, repair this, boost that, or tweak this.  It ended up getting really old for me fast.\n\nThe ships shapes are predefined, so don't be thinking you get to come up with your own shapes.  I think that would have added another level of fun to the game for me, and I was disappointed when I found out it was puzzle placement instead of strat/tatic planning and building your own.\n\nIf you don't mind those downside, and like tower defense.  You'll most likely enjoy this game.","June 28, 2014","true","4.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There aren't many stages in the game so the difficulty ramp too fast and a few gimmicks are designed to seriously annoy you more than giving a nice challenge...\n\nMost of the strategy consist of playing the stage, learn where the enemies will pop up, build turrets there, restart stage if strategy failed, and plan ahead your new strategy from what you've learn previously. Keep repeating several times until you finish the stage with your ship in one piece and hopefully ahead of the fastest time...\n\nI would only recommend the game only if it was actually longer and had a way to design/play new stages from the workshop.\n","June 2","false","20.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The need to think ahead and on the go is a challenge, and there are times when the game can be difficult but for myself that like a challenge this is a great thing.\n\nFor anyone that has never played a RTS (Real-Time Strategy) game or any tower defense game, Space Run can be a pain, but FUN.\n\nOnly thing that is a miss with Space Run is the campaign can feel a bit short for time wise compared to other RTS games.

You pilot a cargo spaceship equipped with weapons and defence systems and have to deliver urgent cargo.\n\nBy destroying foes you get money and can upgrade your ships weapons and stuff. This is often necessary in order to beat the levels. The game is quite stressful since there are some RTS elements included (e.g. changing the alignment of your gun). Sometimes there are some nasty difficulty spikes, especially if there is a pirate to combat.\n\nThe story may be forgettable but the replay value is quite high, since you'll want to get all the possible stars, right. Graphics are okay, nothing to write home about, though. To sum things up: this is a nice, fun and easy accessible game, that is hard to beat if you're a completionist, but rather easy if you don't mind third places.","June 23, 2014","true","15.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"

Completed all with maximum score and it was challanging from the frist mission to the last. The abilities and no pause fulles you with adrenaline, gets you on the edge of your seat, and even when victory is yours, you still have to be sure to dock properly with everything patched up. The only time it gives you rest when your brain melted and quit the game to try again with a fresh mind.\n\nThe game has no bugs, glitches, errors, or crashes nothing. It is nice, polished, and sound, graphics, astethic everything is conceled and you don't feel that something is missing. It is a full experience and it gives you many hours of fun (check my playtime I wasn't alt tabing thats for sure!)\n\nThe story is avarage, but it gives you a lot of well realized characters, with theire own humor, and the main hero always have a quote up in his sleave to curve your face to a smile and you have a few plot lines that keeps you going to find out the ending.\n\nThe towers and the setting is extreamly ballanced, everything is viable, but it won't let you hammer trough it, if you are too ineficient it will punish you, and you may complete the  mission, but you won't get the juicy stars! There is a lot of room for different playstyles and the combinations gets multiplied by the build orders wich gets multiplied by the abilities cooldows!\n\nPossible cons: The quotes durring a mission might annoy you being repetative and the pacing of wich you aquire money to gain new tech might be insufficent for your desires and force you to replay a mission for money, tho it happened to me only one single time, but I would probably beaten without "cheating" this way if I really tried.

It's worth a look, but I'll wager that once players finish the game, it won't have the replay appeal that it deserves.\n\nThe Good:  A catchy story that engages the player in the sci-fi genre.  IMHO, I feel engaged in the story to want my character to make the fast, safe deliveries.  I've even played the same job a few times over to get the highest rating and to see what the next job offers entail.  This is also necessary as ship options and upgrades aren't cheap.\n\nThe Bad:  The controls aren't smooth and there's no zoom feature so unless you have a good idea what things look like while they're all clustered together, you may find some frustration when you're placing pieces and even orienting them during the heat of battle.  Maybe it's just me, but sometimes the bad guys seem to have too much of an advantage...I'm also open to the idea that I'm not that good of a "tower defense" player, but this isn't about me.  Another aspect I disliked was the fact that destroying a pirate's boosters does not affect their speed.  They manage to keep up with you with their one booster while all seven of mine where giving me maximum thrust.\n\nThe Superficial:  There's some variety in this "tower defense" space battlefield even though it's simply flying from point A to point B (I would have liked to have seen a navigation screen so that I could at least choose the path my craft is going to take a la Starfox navigation screen on the SNES).  The story line adds humor, though your android's responses are repetitive.  Maybe the next iteration, we'll get to chose our crew and even chose a different android.  I for one would find a sassy female android better company than the annoying Addam-12.  I would have also liked the option of selecting the layout of the transport for my deliveries, but the "one man studio" developer made it work with the one you end up using.  Speaking of layouts, Star Wars fans will be happy to see a familiar shape on the BC mission "Asteroids on Steroids".  While I get that space is vast, I was hoping to see more engaging celestial objects in the background such as a comet, black hole, nebula or star.\n\nThough I do recommend the game, I would hope to see a quantum leap in game controls and other improvements should there be another Space Run.  After all, they made a Cannonball Run 2....","June 25, 2014","true","36.5"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

You can win by just placing and watching, but if you want to max it all out you will be managing turrets and don't forget to make sure you have enough power for that special skill that will save you. Also remember what Han said, "entering light speed ain't like dusting crops".....you will cringe the first time you drop out of light speed in an asteroid field.

I've seen it floating around on Steam since it came out, but I never really looked into it too closely. I'm not sure what I thought it was, but I wasn't expecting it to be so good. It's listed as a tower defense game, and while it does have elements of that, I think it's selling the game short to call it a tower defense game. It's so much deeper than that, sliding back more towards RTS territory, which of course is where the tower defense genre came from.\n\nEssentially, you control a space ship that is trying to deliver cargo for various companies. The flights are always a straight line from left to right. In practice, this means your ship is mostly sitting in the middle of the screen as hazards approach from all directions. These hazards include asteroids, pirates, and competitor ships. Every time your destroy something, you get money, which can be used to build more guns and other ship systems like power generators, shields, and engines.\n\nThe entire ship is made of interconnected hexagons, upon which you must place your ship components. The variety of guns is nice, with a handful of different lasers and projectile weapons to choose from. The bigger weapons need power to run, as do the special abilities you can add for all the weapons. There is a lot of strategy involved in placing weapons and the support systems, and on the later levels, you'll sometimes have to retry missions with different layouts to get an optimal configuration. But once your learn the ins and outs of weapons, and figure out how to set arrange your support systems, the game can become very satisfying, as you tear everything up with your big guns.\n\nEach company has its own type of cargo with its own special needs, and the cargos can hamper your ship in various ways. The most basic is taking up space, but they can also take up precious lines of sight needed for your guns, or explode violently when destroyed, inflicting extra damage to your ship. Another actively drains the energy from hexes around it. These add some interesting flavor to the various missions.\n\nYou get credits for completing missions, with more credits for more perfect completions of missions. The great thing is, you can retry missions for more credits as much as you want, so if later missions are too tough, you can build up your ship powers on earlier missions for a while until you're able to pass the later missions.\n\nThe great thing about this game is that even losing is fun, and you never feel like the game is being cheap. You get warnings for all ship and asteroid approaches, so you have time to plan for whichever direction they're coming from. Things can get pretty hectic, but I often find that better planning can alleviate the problem enough to make levels passable. And on the tough levels, it's pretty great to squeeze through by the skin of your teeth. I've never had to retry a level more than maybe five times at the absolutely most to beat it, and I've been having an absolute blast.\n\nThe audio design is nice, with big sounds for all the weapons and other effects, while the voice acting is solid enough that you won't think much of it. But the story is thin at best. It's all about the gameplay here. The graphics are pretty nice, with cool visuals for most for the weapons and other systems. Destroying enemy ships is nice and satisfying.\n\nI can't really find many flaws with this game. It's very focused on what it's trying to do, and it does it well. If you're looking for a deeper action/strategy game. Highly recommended!","February 2","true","22.5"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

You build your ship as you go fighting space battles and protecting your cargo, while at the same time racing the clock to get a perfect five star finish.\nIt has a good progression system unlocking new and more powerful weapons and upgrades as you go, as well as presenting you with ever increasing cargo complexities.\nI'll definitely recommend this game for any RTS or tower defence fans; it has just the right mix of complexity, stress and progression which makes for a very enjoyable experience.\n\nThe only quibble I have with the game is that it is limited in the game play modes on offer; there is a lot of potential to use the core game mechanics for lot more playstyles.\nFor example I would love to see a game mode where you would build up your ship at the start and then fight against random enemies; alternative to start with basic parts and instead of nuts collect upgrades as you destroy enemies, etc...\n\nOverall a great game, that has a lot of potential to be built on.\n\n","February 1","true","10.2"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

One of the best I've played.\n\nMany tower defense games have you set up towers and then watch as they do their thing while you have minimal interaction with them. This is quite different - every tower has one or more abilities that can be activated, and you will constantly be triggering abilities and building things during the game. There is no downtime. Personally, I find most TD games a little dull and found the frenetic gameplay of this one to be a refreshing relief. However, people who like more traditional TD games may be turned off by the micromanagement.\n\nMuch of the technique involves memorizing the build order -- you play a mission once, lose, then try it again while knowing what will attack when.\n\nNormal mode was fun but a bit easy. Hard mode was poorly balanced - you gain resources so slowly that you need to replay missions a lot to unlock new ones and the grind is not fun.\n\nThere is about 20 hours of content here, which will stretch out to about 30 if you want to get a perfect score in each level. It is well worth the purchase price.","December 13, 2014","true","45.9"," 9 of 17 people (53%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","53","9","17","0","0"

It has its own unique way of approaching the genre by making your 'base' a forward moving platform (a spaceship) with variable speed - depends how many and how good engines you've built on it - and a time limit that will determine the rewards you gain from each mission. The fast and frantic pace of the game is one of its good qualities, and even though I'm sure there are those who will be put off by it, I'd still recommend you give it a try. Yeah, it's faster than most other from-top-to-down view tower defense games, but trust me, you get used it.\n\nI also liked the comic book style look the game has. It fits with the humor thrown around by the characters in the game, who are each voiced by above average voice actors, in my honest opinion. The sounds in the game are familiar sci-fi laser blasts, explosions and whatnot you'd come to expect from a game where you fly around in space.\n\nThe music is also very typical to the genre; by no means bad but neither are any of the pieces I've heard so far something I'd like to listen outside the game. Still, they fit with theme of the game well, and thus I'm forced to give them A- grade.\n\nAll in all, game I'll recommend to anyone who likes tower defense type of games and who are looking into trying out something new and different for the genre!","June 15, 2014","true","5.6"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

It's pretty basic and involves a good bit of stratagy and forsight.\n\nYou fly (on rails) through a level. The faster you do it, the better you're rewarded. You can increase your speed by building more engines or power plants (which help boost your engines) to beat set speed goals. But while you're trying to fly your cargo to the other end, pirates and asteroids are in your way. So to stop them, you have to build weapons. Weapons only get a limited arc in which to attack, which means the first time you play a level you're building as a reaction to incoming threats. However after the first time you can build defences where the threats will be. Again, power plants can boost your weapons like they can for engines.\nSo basically you're playing a tower defense game with you buliding the defenses on a platform. As far as tower defense goes, I've played a lot of better TD games. But with one has a few nice qualities to make it it's own thing and not just a rehash.\n\nThe story is sort of bland, but the voices are decent (though some are, perhaps purposefully, a bit annoying).\n\nAll in all, if you buy this on sale, you'll probably get the money worth.

I keep coming back to see if I can do a run a little bit more efficently and squeeze out that last star on the rating.\n\nThe basic idea is this: You're a space runner; someone who ferries cargo from point A to B. At the start, you place your cargo onto a ship comprised of empty tiles, and off you go. Along the way, you'll be attacked by pirates and you'll need to place shields, weapons, and power systems to survive your trip. You'll also need engines to get monetary bonuses for arriving quickly. Space on your ship can fill up quickly so you'll need to find that perfect balance depending on what your current needs are. It's very original and very well done. It reminds me of the top polished tower defense maps you see in the modding community for Blizzard RTSes.\n\nThere are a couple of bad things...\n\nThe default view being zoomed out so far that it's hard to see anything is one. I find myself having to hold down the zoom button frequently just to be able to see what I'm doing. It needs a toggle key. The other slightly annoying thing is the upgrade system. You can upgrade your towers with various powerful abilities, but sometimes it feels like you'll never be able to five star a mission until you get them.\n\nStill though, those are minor things and the game is well worth the money if you like tower defense.","March 7, 2015","true","21.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

The basic premise is straightforward, keep your ship and cargo alive and get to the destination in one piece as quick as you can. You place various tech components on your ship as you go through the level and as your reources allow (which you gather slowly over time or quickly by blowing stuff up). The components are varied: lasers, torpedoes, shields, power gens, boosters etc.. some with special abilities or temporary performance upgrades. There is enough fleixibility in size and shape of each component to make your fitting choices very interesting and replaying levels becomes extremely addictive. There's also a good variety of action, some levels you find yourself frantically clicking away on shield boosts, gun orientation or power ups, other levels are more a matter of carefully chosing the order and placement of your kit.

Its challenging, graphics are good, sound is...well there is always room for improvement there.  A few issues with the guns not responding, but overall a decent game for the price.  Keep in mind, it is still nothing more than tower defense.","February 23, 2015","true","7.6"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

If you stop to think about it, yea its a deploy turret, kill, earn, deploy type of game.\n\nBUT!!\n\nthey added 1 thing that completly changed the classic boring tdf into something tough that baddies cry about. Movement...\nyes... with movement you have to constantly think about building thrusters to get a better time and with that, more money. Plus you can work with thrusters to slow the ship while giving you time to finish missions. Its actually sad to see people struggle so much with this game. But its awesome for hard core tdf fans.\n\nBrilliantly crafted and makes an old concept new and refreshing. Its not only graphics or intensity, but the whole customization/priority mechanic that will get you running more missions.\n\nDefinetly a game i want to see a sequel or some dlcs to.\n\nBasicly the classic we like in a refreshingly new serving.","March 12, 2015","true","11.0"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Gameplay was solid and enjoyable.  I had little difficulty five starring the missions.  I found that many of the various "towers" were either used little or not at all.  Still, the diversity is there so you can try different loadouts.  I pretty much stuck with the same emplacements throughout the whole game, only having to adjust it when a specific cargo got in the way of my usual layout.\n\nAs you progress through the game you will unlock numerous upgrades and new emplacements which you can use on previously completed levels if you are having trouble.  A nice touch was that while in a mission you can see the various mission times mapped out as you travel (IE Normal, Lightspeed times) so you could see in real time how you are doing.  If you see yourself falling behind it is easy enough to allocate more engine power and fire up the afterburners to make up the time.\n\nAll in all, a fun game.  If you're a fan of tower defense games and want to try something new check it out.","March 28, 2015","true","11.0"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

It's pretty basic and involves a good bit of stratagy and forsight.\n\nYou fly (on rails) through a level. The faster you do it, the better you're rewarded. You can increase your speed by building more engines or power plants (which help boost your engines) to beat set speed goals. But while you're trying to fly your cargo to the other end, pirates and asteroids are in your way. So to stop them, you have to build weapons. Weapons only get a limited arc in which to attack, which means the first time you play a level you're building as a reaction to incoming threats. However after the first time you can build defences where the threats will be. Again, power plants can boost your weapons like they can for engines.\nSo basically you're playing a tower defense game with you buliding the defenses on a platform. As far as tower defense goes, I've played a lot of better TD games. But with one has a few nice qualities to make it it's own thing and not just a rehash.\n\nThe story is sort of bland, but the voices are decent (though some are, perhaps purposefully, a bit annoying).\n\nAll in all, if you buy this on sale, you'll probably get the money worth. For the full price, you're taking a bit of a risk. I'll likely continue playing this game until I beat it.","September 16, 2014","true","3.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I keep coming back to see if I can do a run a little bit more efficently and squeeze out that last star on the rating.\n\nThe basic idea is this: You're a space runner; someone who ferries cargo from point A to B. At the start, you place your cargo onto a ship comprised of empty tiles, and off you go. Along the way, you'll be attacked by pirates and you'll need to place shields, weapons, and power systems to survive your trip. You'll also need engines to get monetary bonuses for arriving quickly. Space on your ship can fill up quickly so you'll need to find that perfect balance depending on what your current needs are. It's very original and very well done. It reminds me of the top polished tower defense maps you see in the modding community for Blizzard RTSes.\n\nThere are a couple of bad things...\n\nThe default view being zoomed out so far that it's hard to see anything is one. I find myself having to hold down the zoom button frequently just to be able to see what I'm doing. It needs a toggle key. The other slightly annoying thing is the upgrade system. You can upgrade your towers with various powerful abilities, but sometimes it feels like you'll never be able to five star a mission until you get them.\n\nStill though, those are minor things and the game is well worth the money if you like tower defense.","March 7, 2015","true","21.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

The basic premise is straightforward, keep your ship and cargo alive and get to the destination in one piece as quick as you can. You place various tech components on your ship as you go through the level and as your reources allow (which you gather slowly over time or quickly by blowing stuff up). The components are varied: lasers, torpedoes, shields, power gens, boosters etc.. some with special abilities or temporary performance upgrades. There is enough fleixibility in size and shape of each component to make your fitting choices very interesting and replaying levels becomes extremely addictive. There's also a good variety of action, some levels you find yourself frantically clicking away on shield boosts, gun orientation or power ups, other levels are more a matter of carefully chosing the order and placement of your kit. The storyline is well acted with a nice 'Firefly' kind of feel to the narration and art.\nOverall, I am really loving this game, a big thumbs up to all involved in creating it.

Worth it.\n\nSlow & Clean Review: Space Run had a lot of similarities to a board game called Galaxy Trucker which I am a big fan of.\nSo I was curious and managed to get it cheap (Thank you Special Deals) but if I had paid full price... it would have been worth it.\n\nGraphics: They are clean and decent for what you need. The 2D space setting makes it a bit weird but considering the gameplay it would be too difficult to add a real 3D element so your ship remains flat and it doesn't really need to be given that extra dimension.\n\nThe laser, ion and missile effects are nice. Any system should be able to run this so it's nice knowing your MB's onboard GPU is what is needed.\n\nSound/Music: The voice acting is enjoyable. It's not out of this world but it gives a really nice depth. The main character comes off likeable and his android 2IC has some great dialogue. Only issues is there isn't more. If they released a DLC with additional audio dialogue esp. for the wise-cracking android I'd buy it immediately.\n\nThe music is decent for what you want but it does become repetitive but that's understandable given the music is often the cue for pirate attacks and can be a forewarning before you even detect astroids and other ships on your rader.\n\nGameplay: It's fun. It doesn't give you any time to prepare and you basically need to build and de-construct on the fly. The missions run between 8-15 minutes with 10 being the average. There is no downside to losing which is both good and bad.\n\nGood because there is no real tutorial and sometimes you just don't know what to build until you've failed. And no one likes to lose credits, reputation or XP.\n\nBad because there is no down side to dying, you are never really at risk and that means the equiv of having God mode/reset switch on the universe. I think if the pirate factions got upgrades or bonuses it would have shook things up a bit or at least a change to difficulty but all in all it's moderately difficult the first time and getting that 5th Star Rating can be quite difficult if you don't adapt your tactics.\nI think a survival mode or iron man mode would be a welcome for the hard core gamers out there.\n\nOverall: A fun enjoyable game that is great for when you just want to kill half a hour or need to de-stress from the day. I hope to see a true sequel and looking forward to what Space Run Galaxy might have to offer.\n\nHope the review helped.","February 22","true","21.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

Not to mention the voice over is actually very annoying and much too repetitive.\n\nIts dfeinetly not a Defense Grid, once you've played a missions there is no reason to play it again unless you need money for an upgrade you need to complete a mission. Honestly, while it might be enjoyable for a bit, you're best picking a different game when it comes down to it as there are other TD games that can offer much more, or get it when its on sale but I don't think its worth its current price.","July 12, 2014","false","11.5"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","46","6","13","0","0"

You are an intergalactic delivery man/ smuggler just trying to make your way through the galaxy. You get jobs, and finishing those unlock harder jobs. Its fun to replay these jobs later when you have more upgrades to try and get all the stars for it. You are judged by how much of the cargo you get to the point with, and how fast you get it there. you start out with basic modules, they take one space, and need no power to work. Eventually you will get parts that take lots of space, and need power to work, so you will have to plan out where you place weapons, generators, and defensive systems. Each system also has three upgrades, two active abilities, which take the same resource as building them. The third is a passive boost that happens when you give the system enough power. I just wish there was a pause feature so that you could build stuff and activate abilities without being overwhelmed from all of the enemies on screen.","November 3, 2015","true","16.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I also really want to be able to play it without constant frustration, but the developer has intentionally made sure that isn't possible. Space Run starts out really fun and interesting, but quickly turns into a tedious mess of micromanagement.\n\nI love the ability to turn your turrets to face new threats, but when you have 8 or more of them on one ship, along with dozens of other modules that all have their own unique abilities, it gets borderline impossible to manage them all simultaneously. This could all be fixed with a simple active-pause button, or a speed slider. Instead, you get waves of enemies thrown at you before you have any time to react, and it only gets worse as the game progresses. I realize that some people enjoy that kind of gameplay, but many don't.\n\nThis same sentiment has been shared with the developer many times in the forums. Their reaction was to let everyone know that there would never be a pause feature, while at the same time acknowledging that a huge number of players want it. I suppose if they don't want my business then they won't get it. I certainly won't be buying the sequel.","May 24","false","3.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The guns should track automatically within the gun placement allows accordingly to your outer hull.

Now I want to address some of the common complaints.\n\nFirst: Micro-Management. Many people complain about not being able to keep up with the need to micro-manage their turret orientation. There are really only 3 turrets that change direction and one of those works only as a toggle on way or another. My only suggestion about this is to stop using the basic turret (and the ion) altogether. Except in very specific circumstances, the second tier laser is more powerful than the same three tier ones that it costs to build one and leaves you one extra space on your ship for something else. It is also much easier to micro manage than the tier one since all you need is one press of the hotkey. So use the tier 2, and if you don’t have the tier 2 yet be patient better solutions are coming your way soon.\n\nNext, a pause button. While be nice to a have pause button as part of a lower difficulty setting, I don’t really think it is necessary. If you take my earlier advice about the main turrets, that will reduce the actions per minuet needed to keep up. As for repairing, try using the second and third tier generators when you get them. They both have an option for repairing the whole ship at once (and it is often cheaper too, if you have taken some heavy damage). And of course, learn your hotkeys.\n\nLastly, memorization. Another complaint is that the only way to win is through memorization. While this is mostly true, since the ship layouts can be pretty restrictive, having too much randomization in the levels would make the difficulty change significantly depending on luck. Also, not to brag too much but I managed to five star many of the (non-boss battle) levels in the 80 to 130 rep range of the game on the first try. It is possible you just have to not panic, analyze your ship for good weapon placement possibilities, and keep some tier 2 and 3 missiles around to use their targeted attacks.\n\nIn short, I liked it. Most of the complaints about the game are indeed valid, but are compensated for later, once you get deeper into the game.","July 8, 2014","true","30.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

So use the tier 2, and if you don’t have the tier 2 yet be patient better solutions are coming your way soon.\n\nNext, a pause button. While be nice to a have pause button as part of a lower difficulty setting, I don’t really think it is necessary. If you take my earlier advice about the main turrets, that will reduce the actions per minuet needed to keep up. As for repairing, try using the second and third tier generators when you get them. They both have an option for repairing the whole ship at once (and it is often cheaper too, if you have taken some heavy damage). And of course, learn your hotkeys.\n\nLastly, memorization. Another complaint is that the only way to win is through memorization. While this is mostly true, since the ship layouts can be pretty restrictive, having too much randomization in the levels would make the difficulty change significantly depending on luck. Also, not to brag too much but I managed to five star many of the (non-boss battle) levels in the 80 to 130 rep range of the game on the first try. It is possible you just have to not panic, analyze your ship for good weapon placement possibilities, and keep some tier 2 and 3 missiles around to use their targeted attacks.\n\nIn short, I liked it. Most of the complaints about the game are indeed valid, but are compensated for later, once you get deeper into the game.","July 8, 2014","true","30.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

An item can be cargo (you need to place a given amount per mission), attack towers, defense towers and utility towers. Once you placed your cargo the mission starts. The map starts moving around you == your are flying to your destination. You build and change your tower layout and change settings of the towers throughout the mission, while different types of enemy ships or asteroids are heading towards you. You destroy them and collect points, which you can use to build more towers or enable special functions of your towers.\n\nIt starts easy enough and accomplishes to bring in new towers and cargo, while not overwhelming the player. But also without boring him or her to death. I like how you can use multiple approaches that all lead to success.\nThe missions do not change, so if you play one mission again and again, you will know what enemy will come next, even before it shows up on your radar.\n\nMy only fear is, that it has only a fixed amount of levels and afterwards you are done. But at the moment I am still struggeling to manage the last couple of levels. Update: I am at 100% missions and 100% achievements on medium difficulty after 34 hours. But as I said, I really like this tower-defense approach and I think I made a good decision buying this game.\n\nFirst things that come to my mind:\n+ The steam achievements are connected to reasonable events.\n-  Before each level starts, you set up your ship. It would be nice if there was a free-build mode to see what tower-cargo-combination will fit on the ship.\n\nI really like this concept and I want to see more games like this.","August 7, 2015","true","35.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Instead of sitting in one spot and placing towers and letting enemies follow a path, you move and enemies come to you! This means you have to be careful about placement of offensive and defensive modules, as they can come from anywhere. There is radar, so you have a heads up where they're going to be. You command your ship, and decide what modules would benefit the situation. However it's more fun than that, as you're in a real Space Battle. Over time, you are stronger, and the enemies as well. Be sure to get upgrades, as they're necessary and many come with fantastic offensive and defensive features, changing the outcome of many situations.\n\nIn the beginning, I was not good at this game. Then I tried different strategies and found a few that work more often than not. If you're having trouble, you can instantly restart the map and choose a different course of action. Use your rewards to get upgrades, and you can revisit past levels and get more stars and money, and continue to invest in yourself.\n\nMy tips for this game are place your cargo in the center of your ship, but not jumbled together as you'll likely want to place modules in-between them. Get upgrades to help with tricky situations, and use them. The space battles become very intense, and extremely fun to the point I played them over and over, it is exhilerating!\n\nThis is by far the best tower defense game I've played, and I reccomend it highly.

I really loved the concept of freely being allowed to build my own space ship and then fly though a TD-like map.\nBut the more I played the more I realized that you are surprisingly restricted, and later in the game you pretty much HAVE to build very close to this exact layout that the devs had in mind, and that just sucks...\n\nWhat makes everything even worse is that every mission you take has some sort of gameplay-modifier in the form of cargo/passengers that you HAVE to bring with you.\nThey add more difficulty since some of them can for instance explode when destroyed which will destroy a part of your ship.\nThat would not be a problem if it weren't for the fact that all these things that you carry with you are INCREDIBLY BULKY!\nThey take up SO much space that you are always forced to sacrifice room that you would otherwise be able to fill with turrets and machines.\nThis is so incredibly annoying since it forces you to actually sell, rebuild and replace most of your defences during the mission so that you can fight off different kinds of enemies and obstacles that you are facing at different times.\n\nI can only guess that the point of all this is to make the gameplay more difficult or dynamic, but honestly, this is what's ruining the game for me.\nI would have been perfectly happy to just be allowed to design my own space ship and fly through these spac-TD maps, but the missions quickly go from being fun, to fun and kinda challenging, to annoying as hell.","July 3, 2015","false","10.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The strange thing is that even though you might be able to finish the map faster, you will still fight the same amount of enemies.\n\nDon't play this game if you hate spamming keys, by the way.

You're having to manage temporary power-ups for each individual turret/structure, changing the aiming degree of each laser turret, one by one, repairing each damaged structure, moving your mouse around to collect scrap for constructing, selling individual structures you won't be able to repair in time, picking a permanent aiming degree for missle launchers while hovering your mouse over others to see which direction they're angled to make sure you have coverage in all directions, trying to keep adding more thrusters because you have to go faster to get enough credits and reputation points to get better unlocks, and moving individual turrets' aim because those turrets are blocking -other- turrets from aiming.\n\nIt's a micromanagement nightmare. Anyone who takes pride in their twitch skills or who is good at micromanaging or just playing stuff like Starcraft online and being fast and skilled might get a kick out of this game. However, if you're kinda ADD, OCD, or just awful at micromanagement in games, then it's very possible you may not enjoy this game. It's not an awful game, but it certainly is not a game for me or others who lack the ability to do well micromanaging in games.

Theres a huge number of people in the forums debating why the heck they didnt add a tactical pause button to issue commands.\n-Everything is extremely linear, you can repeat levels and the same enemies always come a the same time. So your task is actually to memorize the levels (due to lack of the pause button) to respond fast enough. Then repeat the same level over and over to farm money and upgrade your weapons. Otherwise you have no chance to survive the next levels due to the insane difficulty.\nthis quickly becomes a boring chore, and there is no room for creativity or individual play styles, as each level kind of dictates how the ideal ship setup should look like.\n\nAs one other reviewer mentioned, this is actually a puzzle game rather than a tower defense game.

Then it seems the missions are setup so you must have the right tower in the right place.  So then it becomes a game of timing and speed rather than strategy.\n\nAlso, I wish I could skip the dialogue completely, but you only have the option to go to the next character's lines.

You really have to plan your strategy: which turrets will you use, how to position them (space on the ships is limited, and often taken up by bulky or inconvenient cargo), and managing your power ups so you have 'nuts' (money) when you need them.\n\nIt does seem that you can replay levels endlessly, which allows the player to max out every turret. It might be nice if this were limited, forcing players to choose a strategy (offense or defense) and run with it.\n\nWorth every bit of the $10-ish it cost. I hope it makes its way to iPad.

If you are looking for a good tower defence game this ain't it. Try DG2. It's more of a top down space shooter/build game. It would be interesting if the game mechanics weren't so lousy. Most of the weapons require you to aim them or to otherwise control them to gain the use of a special feature while at the same being attacked from 4 corners. It's just too unwiedly trying to redirect weapons, repair, build and turn on shields at the same time. It also has no pause or slow speed. The build components are odd shapes and you have to sit there and try and figure out how to fit them in and rotate them to direct fire or effects all the time you are being attacked. Just one difference like more build credits to start, a slow speed or uniform hexes would have made this game enjoyable.","September 18, 2014","false","43.2"," 4 of 11 people (36%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","36","4","11","0","0"

Instead of the enemies coming to you across a map, you move across the map and run into enemies.  You can build varying turrets and activate temporary powers (like a speed boost or increased firing rates).\n\nMy main complaint is it's heavily micromanaging-clicky in a Starcraft kind of way. You need to build, sell, and repair parts of your ship, activate temporary effects, and reposition turrets to point at enemies. Difficulty ramps up in the game by just throwing more stuff at you and so you have to click faster and faster, as well as adding more layers to micromanage. I never liked this in Starcraft and still don't like it here, but if you like this sort of thing you may be right at home. If the game had a pause button so it was more about planning and less about click speed I would probaly enjoy it a lot more.\n\nIt's kind of a step backwards in tower defense evolution when you think about it. The entire tower defense genre came from RTS games as a way to simplify micromanagement into a streamlined experience. Now Space Run puts it all back in and that's not a good thing.\n\nHowever, the game does some cool things which makes it a decent 'check it out on sale game'. I applaud them for trying something new with the tower defense formula. The RPG-lite elements is a great way to keep the game interesting as you progress through the story. The 'story', while minimal, is a nice layer to add to the game that many arcade games just ignore entirely.  I don't regret buying it, but I got it on sale.","September 12, 2014","false","2.9"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"

You're punished for all but the "correct" ones.\nYou can't build your ship in advance, you cannot layout hexes as you'd like, and your ship is erased each time.\nShooter type level design, as in no randomness, and required blind level attempt as recon for real attempt.\nNo sense of engagement because there is no ship progression.\nI don't like having to mouse over kill rewards to collect them. Cheap APM inflation is not gameplay.\nI don't like being unable to zoom out to see the entire relevant area, especially if I'm required to micromanage so much.\nModding not possible, apparently intentionally prevented.\nBoss fights are awful because your weapons intentionally target the enemy bridge last even if there's a clear shot/path.\nCan't pause to send commands or examine the situation. Cheap way of forcing twitch gaming.\n\n-Summation:\nGame is extremely rigid. Worst of both worlds, a grinding arcade game. Plenty of arbitrary requirements to keep you on a rail in various contexts. Essentially a guessing game where the objective is to figure out the one correct sequence of choices needed to ace the test. You're basically forced to beat the game before you have any freedom. Doing new missions is the only way to get reputation, which unlocks parts, which unlocks more reputation. This leads to only one viable play strategy. Low hanging fruit (do untouched missions first) then buy everything you're allowed to buy, and do the next least completed mission.\n\n-Suggestions for Dev:\nGive funding for mission up front, then let us build ship in advance.\nLet us lay out ship hex shape.\nPersistent ship.\nMissiles need to fire 360.\nEliminate reputation system.\nSurplus hex should be converted to SC at the end of missions.","February 6","false","8.7"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

There is no general strategy to this game.  If you are good at tower defense that may not help.  To do well, you have to play the levels a couple times to figure out what to expect.  Sometimes you want shields instead of guns, for example, but there is no way of knowing that until you play.  This also effects ship layout before the mission starts.  The more powerful weapons only shoot in one direction so you better know where the biggest threat is coming from otherwise you end up wasting your building currency.  Mistakes are very unforgiving.  If it had more "on the fly" strategy where the player has to make adjustments to adapt to the situation at hand, I would enjoy this a lot more.","September 7, 2014","false","5.3"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

In its addictive fun is frustration wrought by issues not dealing solely with the genre itself.\n\nThe good: Reverse tower defense!  I've always enjoyed a good TD, and despite its issues, this is still a very fun game; ever since playing old TD mods on Warcraft 3, I have immensely enjoyed the ever mounting challenge that they always seem to provide, and this game is no exception as the challenges come from outside as well as within.  That may come across as being hypocritical seeing as how I don't recommend it, but please, continue reading.\n\nThe bad: Unbalanced modules.  Save your space credits and don't invest in anything except laser cannon, heavy laser turret, force field, and all of the utility modules.  Why?  Use laser cannons until you can buy heavy laser turrets (despite their extra range, missile weapons cannot hit small targets), use force field because most everything will be dead from your heavy laser turrets by the time they fail (and if they do, just recharge them), and the utility modules allow for quite a bit of flexibility (e.g. fitting in power or engine modules in tight spots).  The rest of the modules either take up too much precious space on your ship or they lack the adaptability necessary to get you through missions.  Once you realize this, you'll quickly find that your reputation unlocks a plethora of items that you'll never use and/or upgrade, you'll be swimming in space credits after a few hours that you'll spend on modules only for the sake of spending them, and there's a disturbing lack of options for new tactics and module positioning when you restart missions.\n\nThe ugly: Well, I just said it: restarting.  What makes me say that?  Because you'll be restarting the same missions over.  And over.  And over.  And over.  It will get to the point where one module might get blown up because you were too slow or an asteroid will get too close to the ship and you may as well just restart right then and there.  Did you just invest eight minutes in that mission?  Start over from the beginning, however, because you lack a wide array of useful modules (try using an advanced defense complex against a huge asteroid or a heavy missile system against small pirate bombers) to change things up, you're inevitably stuck using the same setup again and again.  And that eight minutes?  No big deal?  Eight minutes here, three minutes there, five minutes from yonder... they add up faster than you would think.  Without any save option or checkpoint system or even a fast forward button, you have to plod along through the gauntlet from square one every time.  Don't misunderstand me; I've died thousands of times while playing Dark Souls, but every time you do, you can almost hear the game saying (maybe even taunting) "I know you can do better than that", but this game?  All I hear is "Well, sucks to be you".\n\nSpace Run has the makings of a great game.  Robert Clotworthy (the voice actor of Starcraft's Jim Raynor) is the voice of the main character, the graphics are simple yet aesthetically pleasing, and each company's cargo you carry brings its own unique set of challenges in order to shake things up a bit.  I'm two missions away from finishing the game, and while I've had my fun, I feel no compulsion to go back to get reputation stars I missed on earlier missions let alone replay the entire game.  If the game developers fix the shortcomings (maybe even throw in a "Survival: Endless" mode à la Plants vs Zombies where you can build your own ship sans cargo and just get wave after wave of pirates sent at you where you're forced to recycle modules in favor of ones that can handle particular enemies better), I'll come back to waste more of my life having fun with this game, but as it is now, save your money and hope that this gets the tender loving care it deserves.","June 21, 2014","false","21.3"," 3 of 10 people (30%) found this review helpful","30","3","10","0","0"

The experience is pretty much completely destroyed by target micromanagement that isn't natural to the Tower Defense genre.  It is ok that they wanted to use this as an element of their game, but the way they do it is nothing short of clumsy.  Managing the targeting sectors of all the standard cannons leaves the player fumbling with context menus that are easy to misclick.\n\nI'd give it a 4/10, and almost solely because of the horrible controls on the standard cannons.

It's a pretty good game, a nice and different take on the Tower Defence genre, and looks pretty good.\n\nThe lack of said pause button makes the game literally unplayable for people like me that have a bad memory and don't play the game from start to finish so everything is in memory. I have to press Esc to pause the game in the middle of a level, and think to myself along these lines: "Ok, I want to put a missile turret here now, and then realign that turret. What does the missile turret button looks like again? No time to read tooltips after I unpause... Where is the realign button going to be? Oh, what does this turret in my ship do? I can't really remember just by looking at the mesh, specially at this zoom level."\n\nThe third time I had to do that, I decided that this didn't make any sense, and I'd wait for the tactical pause that I was sure would eventually come out, sinse so many people were asking for it.\n\nNow the developer has come out and stated that no, tactical pause wouldn't be implemented. The players wouldn't be interested in not having "challenging real time threat management". I'll be interested in just being able to play the damn thing, and I'll be the judge of what I will or will not be interested in, thank you very much.\n\nIf you have a good memory and lots of time so you can play it from start to finish without a long hiatus so you don't forget what everything is, then by all means, It's a solid, 8/10 game.\n\nFor me personally, with bad memory and not much time, without a pause button, it's unplayable, so I won't even bother to give it a score.\n","June 19, 2014","false","3.5"," 3 of 12 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","3","12","0","0"

Most of the towers have one or two activated abilities that need to be manually activated. In the heat of things, you'll be frantically going from tower to tower adjusting their orientation or activating an ability, just to make it through.\nA good Tower Defense should be about the strategy, not about how fast you can click everything.\n\nImagine playing an RTS game with 20-40 units, and you have to command them all individually. That's what this sometimes feels like.\n\nSo if you wanted to try a cool and fresh Tower Defense game, while still keeping with the feel and flow of what you've come to expect from the genre, stay away from this game.\nIt looks polished enough, but this is less of a tactical game and more of a click-fest madhouse.","June 20, 2014","false","9.2"," 2 of 10 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","2","10","0","0"

I enjoyed the first few levels but when things soon got hectic, the fun drained out of the game. There's no check-pointing either so if you die near the end of a 10-minute level (and you will, a LOT) you need to redo the whole thing. Some of the more hardcore players like this about the game, no question. But for me, the result is a frantic click-fest of a game  that I personally find stressful instead of tactical or fun. We play games for enjoyment, not for stress!\n\nThe weird thing is the gameplay is crying out for such a feature, imo. It feels like a grossly over-looked feature that absolutely should be there, which makes its absence all the more grating. I'd play a lot more of this and recommend it highly with such a button implemented, but without it I just didn't want to play on after only a mere half dozen levels, and I feel the result is a below average game. The devs have confirmed they will not be adding an active pause. Shame. Uninstalling after a hour.\n\nSo just through a single small omission, the devs made a grate game instead of a great game. Ha!

The game runs great and really wraps you into the world as a transporter. Some small issues in how I feel the Tower D aspect is played out, too limiting and not enough options when it comes to allowing you to decide how to build your ship. From no upgrading towers in combat, a level one gun will always be a level one gun. Even writing this I am torn on this game, some will love it for what it has, but sadly I see what it doesn't, and because of what its missing, I feel that hurts the game play greatly. All I can say is watch the video, see for yourself, the game is not bad, but due to what it lacks you may not want to get it. Thanks for your time and viewership.

You have a lot to worry about on each level, and the tower abilities are very diverse.  You don't sit in one place like you would in most tower defense games.  You move from point A to point B.  Your goal is to get to the end of each level as quickly as possible with all your cargo intact.  Trust me, it's a challenge!\n\nThe production quality is very high.  The dialogue is fully voiced and voiced very well.  The story can be skipped at all times, so you won't be annoyed by anything story-related.  The menu design is very pretty and easy to navigate.  The space backdrops are a little bland, but the ships are all unique layouts which offer a variety of challenges for tower placement.\n\nThere are a few caveats to this tower defense design.  Firstly, I hate the limited space on early levels.  You can't do much with your later tower unlockables on the early stages, so you won't want to replay them.  The later levels offer larger ship layouts which allow for much more choice of where to put your towers and cargo.  Secondly, I unlocked all the towers and abilities way too soon in the game.  I ran out of things to do before I even got to the final level.  I never beat this game because I got bored of it and just wanted to quit due to the lack of late game content.  It doesn't help matters that the later levels are extremely hectic and actually lag a little bit from all the ships coming into the view at the same time.  I wish the game engine was a little faster and better optimized for the massive ship-versus-ship-versus-ship-versus-etc battles.  Ultimately, I decided to quit once the game crashed at the end of a very hard level.  I decided I was done.  That said, I had already enjoyed the game for about 12 hours, so I got my money's worth.","December 8, 2014","true","12.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There is a small amount of micromanagement, there are multiple possible ways to complete maps. Planning, timing and strategy are a must...

I feel like there is not much actual customization though. Your cargo always limits your space, so you can't actually beef up your ship to your liking much of the time, no matter how many upgrades you have. Also, it seems like the ship is always laid out in a way that certain components can only go in certain spots (like you can only put the top engine in one spot, and you'll always want the biggest laser turrent in this other spot). It just makes everything feel constrained, like you can't just go crazy and make a missile-only ship or double down on defense. In many tower defense games, it's fun to replay a map and try different combinations, but combinations are very limited here. Also, the lack of reload points kind of sucks. You might get to the very end of a mission and lose some of your cargo, but you just have to start the map over, and repositioning turrets can get very old.","October 9, 2014","true","18.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You cannot place weapons at this stage.\n2) you don't get to change the shape of your ship (its a pre-determined shape that changes each level) you only get to determine what is built on what part of the ship\n\nI haven't had any significant problems playing this game after installing the betapatch. It is a well designed and coded game.\n\nSuggestions for the dev, maybe have a DLC where you can modify the shape of the ship, and take it through longer/harder missions.

I like the strategy and the consideration you have to give to placement to your turrets and cargo, it makes it very interesting and offers a lot of replayability. But it has a few issues which I will elaborate on below:\n\n1. It is clearly a port from a touch screen game and the devs didn't really bother themselves overmuch with fine tuning it for a PC. E.G. In order to collect money from enemies you have killed you have to mouse over them. Modability does not appear to be a priority, if there was workshop capabilities added in I think this could be amazing.\n\n2. There is no pause for you to react to things. I would really like the ability to pause like the ability in FTL. I haven't gotten super far into the game but I think we need the option to pause and make decisions, there can be a lot going on in the game and as things progress I think there will only be more activity.\n\nThis is a pretty solid game, that, with a little bit more effort from the devs can be a really great game.","June 17, 2014","true","10.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You also get alot of useless things you have to put on your ship that take up space and will even drain your power in some instances forcing you to build in stupid patterns and waste slots on power cores, it makes the ship look like a slop pile.\n\nOne mission I had over 1k resorces at one point but stuff was flying around me so much I could not build fast enough (no pause feature).\n\nThe fact that you have to not only build turrets but engines as well to try and get to your location fast enough can be a pain, slot management has made me replay too many missions far too many times because of not knowing which direction what was going to come after me.\n\nThere is no "meh" option for recommending this, so I have to put yes, but honestly its fun to a point, but very frustrating at the end of the day. If you want alot of challenge in pointing your turrets in a direction, and the nessissity of constant reorientation and snap decisions in placing turrets while being overwhelmed this is a good TD, however, breaks are few and far between especially in the late stages.

A combination of a Tower Defense style with some additional strategy added into the mix. I wasn't entirely sure what to expect. I decided to give it a shot and it is certainly worth the price tag. As I am progressing through the levels I find myself needing to go back and redo levels to get better scores and achievements. You have the ability to upgrade your ships abilities and turrets whether it be a more defensive approach or just all out offensive. This is definitely something I can see providing hours and hours of a good time.\n\nThe learning curve is quite small. After a couple levels it was easy to catch on and it throws you right into the mix which is very enjoyable rather than a long drawn out tutorial. There is some relatively comedic banter between the android on your ship and others that offer you jobs as well as your characters random one liners. All in all it's a pretty good looking product with a lot of potential for multiple play throughs of each of the levels whether it be making sure you deliver all the cargo without any losses, to trying to get the quickest delivery to get the higher reputation score. The reputation equates to unlocking more levels. More levels mean that you have so many new ship designs which keep you on your toes when it comes to the placement of your turrets.\n\nThumbs up. I definitely recommend giving this one a shot.","July 3, 2014","true","12.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Played it. Loved it.\n\nSpace Run is all about placing turrets, generators and shields, protecting your cargo and command bridge. Ships are made of hexes, and their placement and number is defined by the mission. One of our main challenges is the time.\n\nOn the start of each mission we must place cargo, bridge and engine. Then, we are leaving station. In the main part of game we can build structures of hexes, using HexNuts. Some structures have ablillities, like hot-fix. These abillities use power.\n\nWe are making deliveries for 5 different companies. Each companion has different cargo to deliver: nuclear waste(exploding and taking half of your ship away), alien artifacts(draining energy around it or spawning alien crap on ship), AI(must be connected to your bridge before completing the mission), containers(nothing special) and my worst nightmare. these one-hexed things must be placed on the edge on the ship, and it takes 3(!) hexes around the edge, making it impossible to build lasers there.\n\nBut time is not the only enemy. There are also pirates and asteroids. Asteroids are one hitting several hexes at once, and the pirates damage may vary. Smallest pirate ships (drones) are weak, but the bosses are incredibly strong without good tactics. Sometimes you will encounter friendly ships, which can be destroyed to earn HexNuts to build something on your ship.\n\nSome things are unbalanced, for example one of the lasers pierce through enemies like katana through butter. Some ship layouts are also unbalanced. One mission was extremly hard, becouse the ship had the shape of Millenium Falcon(Star Wars).\nThe bridge was exposed, and you had to protect it with shields. Shields need power generators, and the bridge was so far from the main part of the ship, that the shield existed only to protect it. What a waste of HexNuts. But the worst thing was boss. Pirate, with MLGPRO360NOSCOPE ion cannons, laser cannons, shields, and rocket launchers. I made it,  having to spend only 2 hours on farming other maps to unlock new equipment.\n\nMy opinion:\n9/10\n- unbalanced\n+ the rest","September 8, 2014","true","12.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Different levels have different hazards, but also different handicaps on your ship.\n\nThe story is funny at times, but not really a big part of the game. The later levels are hard, and just surviving is often a challenge. There are some subtle (and not-so-subtle) references to various sci-fi series, and plenty of replayability.

All fairly simple, in terms of microing, and very rarely did I have those misclick moments where everything went suddenly sideways because I falsely thought I had activated an ability.\n\nPros:\nInventive\nFun\nEasy-to-use interface\nMultiple ways to upgrade/arm yourself\nGood level replay value as you upgrade\n\nCons:\nIf I hear that Android's ridiculous commentary one more time, I'll delete his data so hard he'll....\nRepetitive, unoriginal, OBNOXIOUS exclamations.\nStrategy for each level is often formed after playing the level several times to get the feel for how the enemy waves spawn, because those spawns do not change\nVoice "acting" is somewhat...ridiculous.\n\nHonestly, for full price I don't know ($14.99), but if it's on sale, definitely worth the purchase!\n\nIf they added a "build your own ship framework" option to essentially "build your own level" that would be awesome.","September 10, 2014","true","30.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I suggest watching some videos to pick up what the game fails to teach you, it will make for a much more enjoyable experience.\n\nApart from that the game nicely remixes the tower defense genre with some fun new twists.  The tagline says it all; get your cargo to its destination as fast, and as damage free as you can.  This can be done numerous different ways, but as you fine tune your technique, you'll arrive sooner with less damage.

Your job is to make it to B as intact as you can.\n- on the way, you will be assaulted by all manner of ship and asteroid strikes, hoping your turrets and shields etc. can adequately defend you.\n- Providing further depth and keeping with the theme, your job is also to transfer cargo of various kinds from A to B, getting more cash the more cargo you deliver intact. Each cargo takes up valuable hexes on your ship with various mechanical complications, like cargo that MUST be placed on the vulnerable exterior edge of the ship, or cargo that drains power from all adjacent hexes.\n\nI was definitely very happy with this out-of-nowhere indie TD, at full-price no less.","September 10, 2014","true","16.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a fun tower defense game to start with, but add in a lot of interesting upgrades, each with their own tactical implications, and thiis game becomes truly engaging. Add to this a loose story line with excellent voice acting, stunning visuals, a heckling sidekick, and you have a winner.\n\nThe only criticism I can offer, and it's light criticism, is that I rarely used or never even touched some of the most upper-tier upgrades in completing the game. I still have no idea how much they add to my ship.

Your spacecraft is made up of a collection of hexagonal tiles, the layout of which differs from mission to mission.\n\n# You will come up against asteroids and pirates in a variety of forms, sizes and quantities including 'boss' type enemies.\n\n# Each mission you begin by placing the single engine and power slots and your assigned quantity of cargo slots across the layout of your ship. You must then start the mission and make use of 'construction points' of which you will be provided some at the beginning and which will slowly regenerate as the missioin progresses.\n\n# You collect more construction points by destroying asteroids, pirates and other cargo ships that you come across, spending these points on slots and special  slots-specific abilities which you unlock as you progress.\n\n# There is strategy in the construction of you ship, using the layout of hexagonal tiles, creating the right mix of offensive, defensive, supportive and engine slots so that you can adequately protect your cargo, survive attacks and go for the speed bonuses on each level - The added constraints of the free space some slots require around the ship and in that some slots require multiple hexes and/or a minimum distance from extra power nodes.\n\n# As you progress, each mission gives you quantities of 'Fame' and 'credits' dependant on your performance. The Fame works like a level cap, with higher levels unlocking new ship slots for you to buy with your credits. You also use credits to upgrade these new slots to add new abilities which you can temporarily switch on during a mission (For example rapid 40 second rapid fire boost for laser turrets). Each slot has three upgrades, the third of which is usually a passive, permanent enhancement of the slot (for example, 30% boost to engine output).\n\nIn many ways, this game feels like Space Pirates And Zombies (SPAZ) in art style, combat, upgrades/levelling and to some extent story and humour. There is a smattering of story, but it is essentially pointless.\n\nThe tower defense elements are very reminiscent to me of Sanctum in how you are supposed to place, manage and pair them to create the most desireable effect.\n\nThere are some complaints that the game ends up requiring too much micro-management, but this feels more me to be a misunderstanding of what the game is: This is not a tower defense game, its more like a strategy defense game. The micro-management is intentional and provides challenge through both the creation of your ship and your use of slots and abilities.\n\nSome of the most fun I've had with the game is micro-managing my turrets so that they create interlocking fields of fire to track a passing ship and gradually shifting the orientation of each turret as the passing ship moves out of the fire arc, slamming the enemy ship with continuous broadsides.\n\nEqually, some of the most tense moments were monitoring areas that were taking a pounding and timing the use of the shield recharge bonus and the Laser turret rapid fire to keep my slots and cargo alive.\n\nI would highly recommend this game.","June 28, 2014","true","8.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However, they're very different. The only similarities they have are modular ship designs and traveling in a linear path on a specific mission. Space Run is a level by level experience. You are to deliver various goods or people from point A to B all involving you traveling in one direction in space from station to station. Along the way different types of enemies with different technologies, attacks methods and etc will spawn from various directions and attack you. You do not control the direction of the ship instead comes in tower defense play. Each different mission will have a different amount of "buildable" space on your "ship" to place various towers as well as the goods you are to deliver. Yes, your goods can be destroyed like any other tower in the game. It will reduce the gold/rewards you get but in most cases it is still worthwhile to finish your current mission rather than rage and restart the level. The game gets increasingly hard the further you go for each companies delivery missions and you are provided with many different options and play styles that can be fitted to your preference of tactics or what's demanded of you. Personally, I find it a bit difficult to get what you need versus what you want. Pro tip there is to spec what you think you will need for the mission ahead but there's no forewarning. This kind of leaves you stuck with upgrading certain towers that work in most general cases and you don't really get to enjoy the use of other towers due to the fact they're expensive or are too specialized against certain enemies that may or may not spawn this mission. Overall, it's a very fun game with a new twist you won't find anywhere else for Tower defense games. If you enjoy FTL or are a fan of the tower defense genre then you should get this game. Definitely worth full price.","June 28, 2014","true","3.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game is fairly micro intensive on most levels, especially later on. The game manages to keep the pressure on with a thrust system which moves you along a linear track with timed runs. Thrust takes up the same space your guns do, so a significant amount of planning is required. The first few missions are very easy to get perfects playing it by ear, but the later levels will require you to take into account which waves come from which direction when, what sorts of defense is needed, and how much thrust you need to maintain during replays.

You have a lot to worry about on each level, and the tower abilities are very diverse.  You don't sit in one place like you would in most tower defense games.  You move from point A to point B.  Your goal is to get to the end of each level as quickly as possible with all your cargo intact.  Trust me, it's a challenge!\n\nThe production quality is very high.  The dialogue is fully voiced and voiced very well.  The story can be skipped at all times, so you won't be annoyed by anything story-related.  The menu design is very pretty and easy to navigate.  The space backdrops are a little bland, but the ships are all unique layouts which offer a variety of challenges for tower placement.\n\nThere are a few caveats to this tower defense design.  Firstly, I hate the limited space on early levels.  You can't do much with your later tower unlockables on the early stages, so you won't want to replay them.  The later levels offer larger ship layouts which allow for much more choice of where to put your towers and cargo.  Secondly, I unlocked all the towers and abilities way too soon in the game.  I ran out of things to do before I even got to the final level.  I never beat this game because I got bored of it and just wanted to quit due to the lack of late game content.  It doesn't help matters that the later levels are extremely hectic and actually lag a little bit from all the ships coming into the view at the same time.  I wish the game engine was a little faster and better optimized for the massive ship-versus-ship-versus-ship-versus-etc battles.  Ultimately, I decided to quit once the game crashed at the end of a very hard level.  I decided I was done.  That said, I had already enjoyed the game for about 12 hours, so I got my money's worth.","December 8, 2014","true","12.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Lots of different weapons and modules with which to outfit your ship make for some interesting combinations. Some micromanaging is required during some of the more intense fights, as you are constantly trying to maximise damage output while minimising risk to your own vessel.\nthe only downside I can find so far is the fact that some, if not all runs, can not be completed with full points on the first try. Unless you're lucky off course. Enemy waves pass your vessel from all sides, but during levels not every side of your ship is attacked with equal ferocity. This means that building a symmetrical ship is usually a bad idea, either because it costs too much, or because you have dps pointing in a direction that is seeing no action. This problem is most felt before the mission begins, when you place your key delivery structures. These take up space you might need. If placed on the wrong side of your ship, you may not be able to defend against the enemy waves effectively. This means several plays of the same trip will probably be required to find the right set up for each mission.\n\nA good game, nice mechanics and gameplay, allthough a little frustrating from time to time when you get blindsided by that last enemy wave coming up on the side of your ship you can't effectively defend.","July 21, 2014","true","8.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This old ad line comes to my mind after playing Space Run for 3 hours straight after purchase.\n\nInterface is great, graphics are fine, voice acting is excellent, and the game has great replay value. It has taken me maybe 4-5 runs of each mission to achieve maximum score but replaying does not feel like grind: the missions themselves are (so far at least - I have unlocked only 6 or 7) relatively short, the longest one I clocked at about 8 minutes. Space Run makes it quite easy for us obsessive-compulsive gamer nerds to let go and come back to it later.\n\nAs I write this, I am thinking really hard to find something wrong with this title but really the only thing I can come up with is that *maybe* somebody might find the soundtrack a bit too repetitive. But given how much Space Run has to offer, and considering how cheap it is, that's really not an issue. You could always play your favorite music in the background and turn off game music from the menu.\n\nIf you're hesitating, I'd say give Space Run a go: chances are, you will like it, and the price is great (there is a 25% discount as I write this, but even without it, the game is worth every penny).\n\nSee you in space!","June 21, 2014","true","29.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It also comes down to tiral and error, since you won't know what's coming on your first run.\n\nOne of the bad things is that it has barely any options to decrease the game speed (you can buy a structure later on which decreases the game speed through abilities, but it comes at a cost of space) to minimize the stress when enemies are coming at you from every side and another is that there are a bit too many clicks required to execute abilities or manage buidlings, but it really comes down to preference.\n\nYou also can't skip the cutscene at the start of a misison and there are no checkpoints, which really makes the game suffer when the missions are running above ten minutes.\n\nAnother bad thing is that really annoying robot companion who insists on commenting on everything that happens with a smug tone, including when your stuff gets destroyed, which will happen sooner or later and there's no option to mute his dialogues. It gets to the point where I almost don't want to play because I hate that character's constant nagging with the fiery passion of a million red suns.\n\nAnyway, if you're looking for a tower defense game which requires thought beyond spamming turrets as well as micromanagment and you have some leftovers from the Steam Summer Sale as well as time to spare, I think this is the game for you.","June 20, 2014","true","28.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Visuals and color pallet are good, the music is enjoyable without being too mellow or overbearing, and the limited voice acting conveys the story appropriately.  Space Run follows the traditional build towers as the level progresses and the warning radar informs you where to best place towers for the upcoming wave.  This game would be much better with more levels available (or a randomizer), but the client differences are the spice of this game.  Most tower defense are the same thing beginning to end, but, in Space Run the client's containers change up the level approach significantly; kudos for making the cargo affect the game.  Big Cargo pods can be located anywhere, Nuclear Star material is best kept safe toward the interior of the ship or you risk massive explosions, VIP Travel cabins are forced to the edge where you lose valuable turret placement options, and the other two clients also throw curves into their missions.  The missions themselves are paced correctly, are not overly long making it easy to replay for five star rankings, and any difficulty can be overcome with a tactical alteration.  I'd like to see some challenge zones with upfront tower building and some configurable ship layouts choices, but as it stands, Space Run is a unique and fun tower defense game.","June 23, 2015","true","14.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Unlocking new structures is fun but expensive. The story is pretty bland. Basically you are a space trucker and act like you're the ♥♥♥♥ even though the cargo is usualy delivered full of laser holes. Its a backwards tower defence game where you can only place the towers in your base and instead of a path enemies screw you from all directions. You have to decide whether to spend you cash (hexnuts) on defence, offence, or utility. None of your decisions will matter though when asteroids destroy you entirely. You can murder innocent fellow space runners with no attack for money yet somehow even though you are doing the same thing as the pirates no one seems to care. It a really fun and strategic game. A pause button might be nice as the game makes you want to rip your ♥♥♥♥ off at every corner. I give it 89/122 AmeriPoints","June 22, 2014","true","15.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You also get alot of useless things you have to put on your ship that take up space and will even drain your power in some instances forcing you to build in stupid patterns and waste slots on power cores, it makes the ship look like a slop pile.\n\nOne mission I had over 1k resorces at one point but stuff was flying around me so much I could not build fast enough (no pause feature).\n\nThe fact that you have to not only build turrets but engines as well to try and get to your location fast enough can be a pain, slot management has made me replay too many missions far too many times because of not knowing which direction what was going to come after me.\n\nThere is no "meh" option for recommending this, so I have to put yes, but honestly its fun to a point, but very frustrating at the end of the day. If you want alot of challenge in pointing your turrets in a direction, and the nessissity of constant reorientation and snap decisions in placing turrets while being overwhelmed this is a good TD, however, breaks are few and far between especially in the late stages. My suggestion, build a small amount of turrets on the outer ring, then spam missles, throw a shield in every now and then and pray a boss lines up with your missles.","July 3, 2014","true","5.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I just didn't understand the game. I waited for a flash sale and picked it up. Despite some poor moves in their response to a "pause" button I'm happy with the game.\n\nIn short, you have a ship with a set of hard points for assigning weapons, power sources, shields and engines. These are all built based on currency you slowly accrue or receive by blowing stuff up. It's not hard to pick up, and I"ve enjoyed the first few missions.\n\nThe game supports multiple user profiles, has some replay value, and is a different take on Tower Defense from my perspective. Highly recommend in the $3-$9 range.\n\nIf you find you struggle with the game's pace, there is a hack documented on the forums that allows you to slow down the game. There are no methods within the game to pause the action to plan our your ship's layout or change the game speed. I haven't had a problem and the levels are only 5-15 minutes long.\n\nMy only complaint is I wish I could zoom in closer on the ship, sometimes it's hard to see which hard points are available.This mainly becomes an issue with placing oddball weapons like the double laser.","June 3, 2015","true","3.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You do it fast and you do it safe and that's why people hire you despite your despicable hat. There is a bit of a story (which I haven't played through fully yet), but it's forgettable. Lots of people hire you, there's some crossing of purposes and shady space pirates, but that's about it. It's all just cut-scenes and dialog portraits but, as a nice surprise, it's all fully voiced. And the voice acting is not bad either. In fact it's quite good. All characters have a distinct personality, from rough-and-ready Buck Mann to salty (space) sea-dog Brown Beard. It's fun listening to their banter.\n\nBut you don't play these games for their plot. This is tower defense, only this time, you... well... instead of having a level where enemies walk down paths and you plop down towers, the level flies through space. No wait, that really is how things are.\n\nEach level is a straigh path, and you have a spacecraft made of connected cells. Everything from cargo to engines to weapons is placed on these cells. As you travel across your route obstacled and enemies fly in from all directions, and it's your task to build up your defenses in such a way that you can take out those pesky asteroids, pirates, and whatnot, earning credits (hexnuts, in this case, don't ask!) to build more stuff. All your constructions can be upgraded in several ways; allowing you to rotate guns on the fly, increase the radius of shields, or have destroyed cells drop some credits to allow faster rebuilding. It's all somewhat generic but also never shallow- you get what you expect and it works all pretty well, especially with the constant lack of space on your craft (because you can't build new cells, ever). More firepower or more speed? Some shields to protect your cargo, or an additional thruster? It's often a frenetic balancing act.\n\nWith the solid mechanics in place, Space Run also goes out of the way to look really nice. There's a certain LEGO flair to everything and while the game never explodes with effects it just looks confidently charming without taxing the hardware.\n\nThere's a nice amount of missions and three difficulty settings- you can alway return to a mission with new upgrades to beat your score, which is also used to unlock new stuff. The game checks for delivered cargo AND your delivery time, and some missions you'll have to play again with better thrusters or other upgrades to earn the maximum possible score.\n\nAll in all, for a tower defense fan, this is an easy recommendadion just to see a new take on the genre- just get it and you'll have some good fun..\nEven if you're just partial to some oddball space scenario where you blow up stuff, you may get some mileage out of Space Run- give it a try while it is on a sale (I got it on a recent 75% sale and those 4 euros were well spent).\n\nThere are some things I would've liked to be included- a pause button and a zoom, for example, but what you get is all solid, proud, and true to the genre.","March 6, 2015","true","6.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'm almost done with the game (have two levels to go) and have thoroughly enjoyed it all the way through.\n\nHighly recommend, I purchased it for $3 on a mega steam sale, and even though I wouldn't have gotten it if it weren't for that, I would gladly pay the $20 pricetag for future sequals. Two thumbs up to the developers.","March 9, 2015","true","21.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Going back and replaying stages with different equipment once its unlocked does increase the replay value but it still needs more for me to do.\n\nAll in all I recommend the game...its fairly short, but its also fairly cheap too.

It is an interesting take on tower defense but it's even more fun to upgrade a spaceship than to just put towers around a map.\n\nThe only thing that seems to need work is the progression. Everything is fun and smooth until 53 stars. (Level 53?) It's not the end yet,  but it's now almost impossible to get new stars. Furthermore, the currency is so worthless at this point that it's really hard to buy further upgrades. How about allowing unused nuts to become currency at the end of each map? I don't want to keep running the same maps grinding out money to update something insignificant. Without doing so, you'll never get to the true upgrades that will help you progress.\n\nGames don't have to last forever. Artificially preventing me from completing a game by forcing me to grind is not the same as actually building in more hours worth of content. I stopped playing Final Fantasy for just this reason. Let's not pretend this is a good idea.\n\nThe game is fun and worth the money I paid for it. The only thing lacking is my sense of accomplishment from finishing the game.

Your task for every mission is to get yourself across the map as fast as possible. The faster you can do it and the more cargo you manage to bring intact, the bigger the reward. Opposing you are waves of hostile ships that can fly in from all directions and do their best to destroy you. As a player you can place turrets, engines and other modules on your ship, which all alter your craft in different ways.\n\nThe gameplay is dynamic and, unlike with similar "defence-oriented games", I never found myself waiting for the next wave or for something to do. There's always something incoming and the game is paced well enough to always keep you buys, without turning into a micromanaging click-fest. At first the game seemed fairly straightforward and simple, but som of the missions during the later half of the game actually got quite challenging.\n\nThe Positive:\n- Well paced, both in terms of the actual battles as well as how you unlock and learn new things throughout the game.\n- Polished, Didn't encounter a single bug during my playthrough. Graphics and sound effects are also well done.\n\nThe Negative/My Nitpicks:\n- The story(to the degree there actually is one) mostly bored me. I had patience for the dialogue and banter between the characters at first, but during the 2nd half of my playthrough I found myself just skipping it all.\n- There's not much to do once you've gone through all the missions, beyond maxing your score. Some sort of Survival-mode or other challenge would have been welcome.\n\nAll in all I'd highly recommend this to anyone who'd like a quick bit of fun with a strategy game. It doesn't last all that long, but it's well done and I've had good fun playing it.","June 14, 2014","true","19.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is the next level of Indie games.\n\nIn space run you are given the task of making it from point A to point B, you fly a space ship holding valuable cargo and it must make its way to base via a route as quick as possible, this basicly means youre flying in the face of danger. Worry not, for your tools against imminent doom are plentiful. As you fly, topspeed, you must find a balance betwen speed, survival and offence using resources gained in the heat of battle to build extra engines, turrets and other spaceship goodies.\n\nThe game has the basic addictive tenets of most tower defense games, but suffers slightly less replayability since its basic premise is to complete a combative time-trial, meaning that there is no "endless mode" as is for most tower defense games, and yes this is a tower defense game. Although space ships are involved, your ships "movement" is a direct path orchestrated by your cargo supplier in each mission, and your opponents invariably show up to lay the hurt on you.\n\nThe intesting extra twist that makes this game fun is that you are not protecting a base,but rather, you ARE the base. As you take damage your cargo gets destroyed and your ship gets dismantled, that means your reward and rank for completing the mission goes down and the space you have to build stuff shrinks. Furthermore, because youre on the clock, bunkering down is not a valid tactic, you need to go fast enough to complete the mission (with extra rewards for accomplishing it post-haste) and you need to be tough enough to survive attacks (and preferably kill the attackers to harvest their loot, lest you become too starved for cash to survive against the ever tougher enemies).\n\nI highly reccomend this game to fans of RTS, TD , Strategy games and Indie games in general.","July 5, 2014","true","32.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If yes, imagine a single-player version of it, mixed with Real-Time Tower Defense.\n\nIf you haven't, well, a few more words.\nPersonally, I'm not a fan of regular tower defense games, but generally the more irregular ones (e.g. Dungeon Defenders) do strike a chord for me. So, along comes Space Run. I bought it more on a whim, because it reminded me of the above mentioned tabletop game, which I immensely enjoy.\n\nSo, what is it with this game?\n\nEssentially, you're a guy tasked to ship stuff from A to B, as fast as possible, and hopefully without losing any of the stuff you're supposed to ship. To fulfill this task you get an empty ship made from hex-tiles which you can then populate with weapons, defenses, and of course the cargo you're supposed to transport.\nHowever, you only place the cargo (and generally a single cheap engine) at the beginning of the round. The rest you have to build, rebuild and manage when and as the situation demands with funds you gain during the rounds from destroying random asteroids, enemies and such. The placement of your constructions is a key feature, e.g. engines can only be built on tiles that face space behind the ship, while turrets can be placed in any direction at the edge of your ship, but then can only fire in the directions they can reach. So you'll soon find that one of the most important creeds of your game is going to be 'Location, Location, Location'.\n\nWhile the first levels (imo) were starting out pretty easy, the latter ones do have a tendency to become rather hectic and challenging, especially when you have to start to compromise (or rather, optimize) wether you need more space for engines to meet a higher quality deadline or rather place another turret to prevent your other engines from getting wrecked by enemy fire.\n\nInbetween rounds you have then the Engineering section where you can upgrade the constructions you already have or unlock new ones from the money that you received during your missions. You can repeat your missions as often as you like, so running your favorite runs multiple times to gather up some money is not a bad idea, especially since getting the best ratings in the later levels really requires the good stuff, in addition to your knowledge how to best use what in which situation. All constructions have 3 upgrade, 2 of which are active abilities, that all differ immensely (at least in the weapon section), and one passive.\n\nThe "story" of the game is pretty weak and is basically nothing much more than an explanation of 'You're a guy shipping stuff from A to B, so here, ship some stuff from A to B.', but honestly, that doesn't really matter, because, hey, shipping stuff from A to B is a lot of fun here. The game is split into several 'chapters', each with their own type of freight to be transported. Those freights will give you different handicaps that make your life only harder.\n\nAs for replayability: Well, I'm not sure what happens when you have all the high-scores on all the tracks with all items unlocked, but I guess nothing. So even if I wouldn't say it has insta-replayablity value once finished (which might take some time; I haven't unlocked all the missions yet, and don't have the top-scores on several of those I've done already), but I definetly can see myself coming back to it from time to time just for a few fun rounds.\n\nSo far I've been enjoying the game very much and would recommend it. I've heard that some people complained about lags and crashes, but it seems that I had the luck of not being affected by any of those, so the game ran fine for me.","June 18, 2014","true","7.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It came out of nowhere, and was a fantastic and unique take on the Tower Defense genre. The constraints the different missions impose on your ship building are varied and make each level a challenge. Because each level is scripted, it means that you can potentially remember the attack patterns of the enemy for each level, making each successive run easier. I don't see this as a downside, but it does limit replayability.\n\nWorth the Movie Money*.\n\n* Movie Money is the amount of time and enjoyment I could get at the movies for the same amount of money I paid for the game.

Visuals and color pallet are good, the music is enjoyable without being too mellow or overbearing, and the limited voice acting conveys the story appropriately.  Space Run follows the traditional build towers as the level progresses and the warning radar informs you where to best place towers for the upcoming wave.  This game would be much better with more levels available (or a randomizer), but the client differences are the spice of this game.  Most tower defense are the same thing beginning to end, but, in Space Run the client's containers change up the level approach significantly; kudos for making the cargo affect the game.  Big Cargo pods can be located anywhere, Nuclear Star material is best kept safe toward the interior of the ship or you risk massive explosions, VIP Travel cabins are forced to the edge where you lose valuable turret placement options, and the other two clients also throw curves into their missions.  The missions themselves are paced correctly, are not overly long making it easy to replay for five star rankings, and any difficulty can be overcome with a tactical alteration.  I'd like to see some challenge zones with upfront tower building and some configurable ship layouts choices, but as it stands, Space Run is a unique and fun tower defense game.","June 23, 2015","true","14.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You also get alot of useless things you have to put on your ship that take up space and will even drain your power in some instances forcing you to build in stupid patterns and waste slots on power cores, it makes the ship look like a slop pile.\n\nOne mission I had over 1k resorces at one point but stuff was flying around me so much I could not build fast enough (no pause feature).\n\nThe fact that you have to not only build turrets but engines as well to try and get to your location fast enough can be a pain, slot management has made me replay too many missions far too many times because of not knowing which direction what was going to come after me.\n\nThere is no "meh" option for recommending this, so I have to put yes, but honestly its fun to a point, but very frustrating at the end of the day. If you want alot of challenge in pointing your turrets in a direction, and the nessissity of constant reorientation and snap decisions in placing turrets while being overwhelmed this is a good TD, however, breaks are few and far between especially in the late stages. My suggestion, build a small amount of turrets on the outer ring, then spam missles, throw a shield in every now and then and pray a boss lines up with your missles.","July 3, 2014","true","5.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A combination of a Tower Defense style with some additional strategy added into the mix. I wasn't entirely sure what to expect. I decided to give it a shot and it is certainly worth the price tag. As I am progressing through the levels I find myself needing to go back and redo levels to get better scores and achievements. You have the ability to upgrade your ships abilities and turrets whether it be a more defensive approach or just all out offensive. This is definitely something I can see providing hours and hours of a good time.\n\nThe learning curve is quite small. After a couple levels it was easy to catch on and it throws you right into the mix which is very enjoyable rather than a long drawn out tutorial. There is some relatively comedic banter between the android on your ship and others that offer you jobs as well as your characters random one liners. All in all it's a pretty good looking product with a lot of potential for multiple play throughs of each of the levels whether it be making sure you deliver all the cargo without any losses, to trying to get the quickest delivery to get the higher reputation score. The reputation equates to unlocking more levels. More levels mean that you have so many new ship designs which keep you on your toes when it comes to the placement of your turrets.\n\nThumbs up.

Your spacecraft is made up of a collection of hexagonal tiles, the layout of which differs from mission to mission.\n\n# You will come up against asteroids and pirates in a variety of forms, sizes and quantities including 'boss' type enemies.\n\n# Each mission you begin by placing the single engine and power slots and your assigned quantity of cargo slots across the layout of your ship. You must then start the mission and make use of 'construction points' of which you will be provided some at the beginning and which will slowly regenerate as the missioin progresses.\n\n# You collect more construction points by destroying asteroids, pirates and other cargo ships that you come across, spending these points on slots and special  slots-specific abilities which you unlock as you progress.\n\n# There is strategy in the construction of you ship, using the layout of hexagonal tiles, creating the right mix of offensive, defensive, supportive and engine slots so that you can adequately protect your cargo, survive attacks and go for the speed bonuses on each level - The added constraints of the free space some slots require around the ship and in that some slots require multiple hexes and/or a minimum distance from extra power nodes.\n\n# As you progress, each mission gives you quantities of 'Fame' and 'credits' dependant on your performance. The Fame works like a level cap, with higher levels unlocking new ship slots for you to buy with your credits. You also use credits to upgrade these new slots to add new abilities which you can temporarily switch on during a mission (For example rapid 40 second rapid fire boost for laser turrets). Each slot has three upgrades, the third of which is usually a passive, permanent enhancement of the slot (for example, 30% boost to engine output).\n\nIn many ways, this game feels like Space Pirates And Zombies (SPAZ) in art style, combat, upgrades/levelling and to some extent story and humour. There is a smattering of story, but it is essentially pointless.\n\nThe tower defense elements are very reminiscent to me of Sanctum in how you are supposed to place, manage and pair them to create the most desireable effect.\n\nThere are some complaints that the game ends up requiring too much micro-management, but this feels more me to be a misunderstanding of what the game is: This is not a tower defense game, its more like a strategy defense game. The micro-management is intentional and provides challenge through both the creation of your ship and your use of slots and abilities.\n\nSome of the most fun I've had with the game is micro-managing my turrets so that they create interlocking fields of fire to track a passing ship and gradually shifting the orientation of each turret as the passing ship moves out of the fire arc, slamming the enemy ship with continuous broadsides.\n\nEqually, some of the most tense moments were monitoring areas that were taking a pounding and timing the use of the shield recharge bonus and the Laser turret rapid fire to keep my slots and cargo alive.\n\nI would highly recommend this game.","June 28, 2014","true","8.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

One of the best I've played.\n\nMany tower defense games have you set up towers and then watch as they do their thing while you have minimal interaction with them. This is quite different - every tower has one or more abilities that can be activated, and you will constantly be triggering abilities and building things during the game. There is no downtime. Personally, I find most TD games a little dull and found the frenetic gameplay of this one to be a refreshing relief. However, people who like more traditional TD games may be turned off by the micromanagement.\n\nMuch of the technique involves memorizing the build order -- you play a mission once, lose, then try it again while knowing what will attack when.\n\nNormal mode was fun but a bit easy. Hard mode was poorly balanced - you gain resources so slowly that you need to replay missions a lot to unlock new ones and the grind is not fun.\n\nThere is about 20 hours of content here, which will stretch out to about 30 if you want to get a perfect score in each level.

Turrets cannot be upgraded directly, however they do have special abilities that can be activated at a cost.  Timing those abilities can be a huge difference maker.\n\nMost tower defense games revolve around killing the enemy quickly.  Space Run takes a different approach, it's about arriving at your destination as fast as possible with all of your cargo.  Thus you'll have to balance adding engines and other defenses such as shields and anti-missle turrets in order to get the best possible score.\n\nYour reward for success is reputation and money.  Reputation unlocks missions, weapons and upgrades.  Money is required to purchase those upgrades.  These unlocks include new turret types, faster engines, special abilities you can use in-game or flat passive bonuses that make a certain turret more effective.\n\nOne thing that keeps things interesting is varying types of cargo.  Some cargo simply needs to make it there in tact, other cargo introduces new difficulties such as draining nearby modules so they're harder to power, or modules that must be connected by the end of the map (costing you space and resources).   When carrying nuclear warheads you even have the option to use one of them on the enemy, though doing so will cost you as that warhead can't be delivered for obvious reasons.\n\nOverall, it's fun.  My biggest complaint is it's too easy. I've gotten a perfect score the first try on most missions, the remaining ones have been a narrow miss.  There's also little to replay and unfortunately weapons just aren't varied enough.  In general building whatever the best weapon you have access to is the right decision.  Maps also have a tendency to favor sending enemies in from one direction, it makes planning your build up rather easy and predictable.  Additionally, while the game offers something like 30 maps they tend to feel very redundant.\n\nExpect to get about 10 hours out of it, 20 if you're struggling and have to replay a lot.","June 21, 2014","true","12.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However I feel that this game's theme (your ship is moving, and it's your ship you're defending) lends itself to more interesting gameplay and more sensible enemy encounters (asteroids, small ships, big ships using different combinations of weapons and loadouts much like yours). As a bonus, they have plenty of evolving and mission specific curveballs to keep the challenge level interesting and get you to think outside of your progressive comfort zone (and, if you're like me, your symmetrical ship design O.C.D.). The dialogue doesn't take itself too seriously, and consequently the humor is pretty high quality as is the voice acting and character design. All around the game just shows a high level of polish in its gameplay design balance, graphical performance, and execution. I highly recommend it!

A pretty simple one, mind you. But in depth, it's much more than that.\n\nWhile the basic of the game consist of building offensive and defensive weapons to keep your ship alive, as well as thrusters to actually move through space, the active part of combat is much more complex than a simple tower defense game. Every structure comes with 3 upgrade slots that can be purchased with credits earned from previous runs. These upgrades mostly consist of 2 active upgrades and one passive upgrade. The active upgrades range from reorienting weapons, over massive single-time attack to quick-repair.\n\nAll in all, the tower defense aspect of the game is just one part of it. Using active abilities wiesely, adjsuting to your stubborn cargo and handling all the micro-management, is the really big part of the game. And no, we don't need a pause button or anything, be fast or die, that's it, that's the challenging part of the game. - And really, it's not thaat hard.\n\nSpace Run is an interesting and fun mix approach that will kepp you well entertained for ~10h if you want to complete it. With the current number of 30 runs, I have to say, I'm not sure if I would've bought it outside the Steam sale however.","June 23, 2015","true","11.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Kinda sucks that there isn't a multiplayer option; the game could be ADDICTIVE if it were implemented.

I actually got it as part of an offer with my AMD graphics card. The options I had seemed lackluster, but this turned out to be quite a good game.

The mid game suffers a bit from wonky ship frames that make it really hard to fit what you need(want) on them, but once you're through that part of the game it gets a lot more fun.\n\nMy only real critique is that there isn't an easy way to plan out your ship in-game or to re-orient or use abilities right when you need to since it's all in real-time, being able to pause in the way you can in say FTL would be very welcome, but I could see how that might ruin some of the action.\n\nIt probably doens't have much replayability since all of the levels have static spawns, but it is a real blast.","June 15, 2015","true","15.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

One of the best I've played.\n\nMany tower defense games have you set up towers and then watch as they do their thing while you have minimal interaction with them. This is quite different - every tower has one or more abilities that can be activated, and you will constantly be triggering abilities and building things during the game. There is no downtime. Personally, I find most TD games a little dull and found the frenetic gameplay of this one to be a refreshing relief. However, people who like more traditional TD games may be turned off by the micromanagement.\n\nMuch of the technique involves memorizing the build order -- you play a mission once, lose, then try it again while knowing what will attack when.\n\nNormal mode was fun but a bit easy. Hard mode was poorly balanced - you gain resources so slowly that you need to replay missions a lot to unlock new ones and the grind is not fun.\n\nThere is about 20 hours of content here, which will stretch out to about 30 if you want to get a perfect score in each level. It is well worth the purchase price.","December 18, 2014","true","12.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Space run spices up the formula quite a lot , you are a space ship that has to deliver something . You have to focus on two things :  the delivery time and protecting your cargo.  You speed your ship up by placing constructions that give you thrust power and you protect your cargo by placing guns , shields ... etc. Space Run fixes almost all the problems i have with the Tower Defense genre , the overwhelming feeling u sometimes get from TD games is gone , the gameplay doesn't feel repetetive and it has a great difficulty curve .\n\nSpace run , in my eyes , is an example on how a modern Towerd Defense game should be done . Polished , relaxing  and those cheesy one liners only make the game better .","January 30","true","7.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You transport various types of cargo for corporations and they give you bonuses for delivering their loads on time. Pirates attack your ship from various angles and it sometimes passes through asteroid fields. You can also attack other cargo ships for resources.\n\nGetting safely from A to B is about choosing where to place containers, weapons, shields, generators, and engines. You always have to make allowances for building enough engines to get to your destination ahead of time. The floor-plan of the ship changes with each mission and there are complicating factors such as orientation of weapons and the requirement to provide power to certain modules. Gathering resources makes the difference between being able to repulse attacks and merely limping on to the next encounter. Accruing more resources by destroying other ships and asteroids not only allows you to build more and better modules, it also lets you turn on temporary power-ups.\n\nThere is a certain amount of grinding involved to earn better modules and power-ups. Often, necessity takes over from forward planning when it comes to deciding which modules to deploy where. Sometimes, the gameplay can get quite frantic. Massive waves of small fighter craft or heavily armed battleships appear with maybe twenty-five seconds warning, which sounds like a lot, but not when you are in the process of fending off other waves of attackers and you are too low on resources to adequately prepare.\n\nOverall, the game is fun and satisfying. If I could change it in some way, I would give it more levels.","October 4, 2015","true","54.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Story is minimal and is just something to string together the scenarios but there's enough flavor, humor, and characters with personality (although one-dimensional/no development) that it strings it together well enough for me.\n\nYou need to balance your combat structures (that destroy things to gain more money and let you survive to the end) with engine structures (that are necessary for speed bonuses). You unlock new structures by spending points you gain by completing mission objectives. You'll have to grind a little but it isn't so bad if you like to spend time repeating missions to try and get a 5-star rank. However, sometimes it's better to just come back later when you've unlocked the better (although more expensive to place) structures.\n\nThere are four types of scenarios, each with unique structures you're forced to place onto the ship that waste space and sometimes have additional negative effects.\n\nIt feels like scenarios aren't randomly generated. There are set tiles and seemingly set enemy spawns and patterns. It's pretty nice from a puzzle/high-score aspect because you can figure out and optimize the best build order. I'm pretty surprised that there is no score attack mode/leaderboards because it feels like it would fit well. However, not having randomly generated missions also means that anyone who really likes it will run out of 'fresh' content.\n\nI would have liked to be able to switch difficulty (rather than be locked into one difficulty the whole time). Or at least be able to have all difficulties on the same profile so you can easily switch between difficulties (and progress is separate for each difficulty). As it is you'd have to go back to the main menu to switch profiles for a different difficulty.\n\nWorth a look for people who enjoy tower defense and would like something with a little spin on it.","April 2","true","7.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
