Took me about 17 hours and it turned out to be one of those games that keep me awake until 10 in the morning.\n\nIt feels and plays like your own personal interactive Star Trek episode. It is your classic "Thriller on the Express" with a strange murder, a killer hiding amongst your crew, an ancient conspiracy, aliens, mercenaries, and a whole load of mystery. In my first playthrough I have failed to reveal a culprit, but thanks to the fact that the game has a lot of replay value, I will delve into it again in the hopes of solving the case and do things differently.\n\nIt's got tons of character interactions (Which you are free to befriend, antagonize or completely ignore), pages upon pages of lore and exposition in the Zenlil's onboard library (Which you can totally avoid if you don't like reading), choices that actually matter and a few twists and turns that I honestly did not see coming (And a couple that I totally did).\n\nThe player is encouraged by the game to explore alternative routes as much as possible. One can reload an auto-save made before a conversation (The game saves into a separate slot every few minutes automatically) and choose a different option if you are dissatisfied with a result. You don't have to, but you can if you so desire.\n\nAside from rather long loading times, a couple graphical glitches and small progression issues such as characters sometimes responding as if I walked away from a conversation when I didn't (Both fixed by loading a previous save), it was a pretty smooth ride.\n\nThis is probably not the game for you if you enjoy fast paced shooters (Although it does have some FPS elements), but if you think you might enjoy an adventure/RPG/quest mix then give it a go.\n","September 19, 2015","true","45.6"," 174 of 199 people (87%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","87","174","199","14","3"

The interaction between player and A.I. seems so natural and realistic, and the voice acting is seriously one of the best I've seen, better than most big budget games. There's a lot of variety in dialogue choices, which actually make a big difference in the outcome(s). I encourage all to play multiple times, you will discover a lot of different things. You will encounter events and situations if you're at the right spot at the right time (some quite humorous), making it seem like a real living world. The story is definitely its other strong point, with plenty of background lore to discover if that is your thing - or otherwise you can be just as engrossed without the deeper knowledge. Graphics are unique, good textures, nicely detailed areas, minor graphical glitches, nothing game breaking. I haven't done much combat, as I prefer the diplomatic options, but from what I have experienced there's nothing wrong with it.\n\nAll in all, it's fantastic on so many levels, and I wait in anticipation for the next installment.\n\nIT'S A ROLEPLAYERS DREAM COME TRUE!","January 5, 2014","true","16.2"," 263 of 328 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","263","328","0","19"

It isn't ruined by poor interaction, bugs or bad gameplay and the likes. It's ruined by the fact that this whole thing is gaming blue balls; a shareware demo; a teaser. There is a plethora of fantastic game content that you ultimately don't get to play with. The combat/inventory system is barely utilized outwith the VR trainer sim. The story is a gigantic cliff-hanger. You're encouraged to use quicksaves to explore alternate dialogue options, but they will only leave you with more questions. Very few will provide the answers you crave more and more as you explore further. The game literally ends when you jump out the back of the futuristic jumbo-jet you start the game in - imagine if the whole of Mass Effect was set on the Normandy and that's about what this title is. If you explore the dialogue and lore (of which there is a near-overwhelming amount of), you'll get some good hours from this game. However, this release is basically a glorified "Murder on the Orient Express" game - or the first half of one anyway. You're going to have to wait a whole lot longer for any closure, and, of course, put down some more cash. A wholly unfulfilling and, in the end, frustrating experience.","January 26, 2015","false","11.9"," 173 of 213 people (81%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","81","173","213","7","6"

Trying to get KOTOR to work on my computer and failing miserably. I go to the store with $20 in my Steam wallet. Fed up and tired to pick an indie game that looked interesting.\n\nI run into CONSORTIUM.\n\nI decide ah, what the hell and buy it. To my surprise, it actually turned out to be a great game.\n\nThe story goes as follows: You are you. The game itself is actually a portal to an alternate reality's future where you inhabit the body of a man codenamed "Bishop - 6" a high ranking officer in the CONSORTIUM. That's all the game tells you about the character (at least in the time I played it) The game physically cannot let you know about Bishop's past, as it glitches out when people talk about it. The characters and the writing are better than a lot of triple-a titles out there and can be very humorous at times.\n\nThe music is beautiful, it sounds like it could go in KOTOR itself, and there is a reason for that: Jeremy Soule composed this game's soundtrack. As an admirer of his work I was pleasantly surprised.\n\nOther than a few minor bugs, the CONSORTIUM is a fantastic experience in my honest opinion.\n\nCheck this game out!

It's also a pretty short game; I finished it twice in about 11 hours.\n\nWith that said, this game is worth playing twice if you enjoy this type of game. What type is that? An RPG with lots of decisions and consequences. Note that, the decisions you make are actually quite impactful, and the game entirely allows you to make "bad" decisions (the game itself describes this as there being no bad decisions). Beyond that, the game explores some fairly cool science fiction themes and does a fairly good job in making those themes interesting and plausible.\n\nJust a small addendum: I said this game is largely based around decisions and consequences. Let me elaborate on this a little. During the game you'll be trying to solve a sort of mystery. You will not be spoon-fed the answers to your questions and your suspicions will not easily be confirmed. Even if you do a pretty thorough job of the 'investigation', there's a good chance you won't figure it out. However: That is okay. If you don't figure it out the game doesn't become less fun after that point.\n\nI would absolutely recommend this game, with one sidenote: This is a short game. If you think a game costing 15 euro or dollar or whatever, should net you ~15+ hours of gameplay, then you should buy this game when it's on sale. I myself bought it at 65% off, but feel like I wouldn't have been upset if I'd bought it at full price.","July 11, 2015","true","10.9"," 64 of 71 people (90%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","90","64","71","4","0"

Lets ignore the game breaking bugs and the fact that most people seem incapable of finishing the game. Lets ignore the peculiar graphics choices since they're functional and graphics arent important as long as they perform all the tasks you need them to in the game.\n\nHere be spoilers.\n\nThis entire 'game' is the intro sequence to a game they havent made yet! You're told bishops are essentially a warrior class, you're given a powerful suit of armour, several weapons and several pieces of equipment that you plug into your armour for various effects...and there is no combat in the game. The combat takes place in a virtual reality suite, there is one opportunity for actual physical combat in the game and it only happens if you screw everything up. Also, the special equipment you get for plugging into your suit that gives you different abilities? that is only given to you AS THE GAME ENDS! Meaning they put work into coding items you are physically incapable of using in the game at any point. They constantly talk about the combat system, the equipment system, your role as a warrior in this alternate society...and before you actually engage in any combat the game ends. This game would have been perfectly fine as an interactive story game. If they had included none of the taunting allusions to combat, none of the equipment and several guns you will never use in any situation (they're even locked down during the game with the safety on, I never even fired them) and focused on the one thing the game delivers, a good narrative and great voice acting, it would have been a good game. But constantly promising that this is a first person shooter with role playing aspects when it is in fact a socialization simulator is misleading and a direct attempt to lull in a different audience.\n\nIn short it's 2014 and having a dialogue tree in a game is not a selling point, we've had those functioning at this level since the 90s. You cant sell a game entirely on the point it has a dialogue tree in it, so they clumsily tacked on some pretend first person shooter aspects to use guns to sell it. The entire 'game' is a sham. It's an interactive movie, which would be fine if they marketed it that way. Including features it isnt possible to use anywhere in the 'game' whilst constantly leading you to believe the game is a first person shooter in the advertising and in the game itself is dishonest and frankly insulting.","January 10, 2014","false","6.7"," 106 of 144 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","106","144","0","7"

No its not like Mass Effect.\n\nI bought this the minute I saw it on Steam. Why? It looked cool and the story/setting got me intrigued.\nThe first hour was a bumpy ride because of a wide variety of bugs. The devs were very honest about it, admitted they should have released it as an early access game.\nI waited, patiently, a few weeks for the devs to fix their game. I started over because the patch also deleted the savegames (which was announced by the devs as well).\n\nThis whole game takes place on a rather small spaceship and you're a Bishop, lead operations if I'm correct.\nThe ships hierarchy is based on chess. You have your pawns, rook, queen, king, etc.  So you always know the status of a crewmember.\nYou're transfered from 2014 into this bishop person. At the start you have no idea who you are and what you're supposed to do. You'll learn by interacting with the people on board, who do not know you're from 2014 (and you might want to keep it that way). The way you respond to these people and actions you take playing this game will get different outcomes. In my 5 hours playthrough I somehow managed to ♥♥♥♥ of most of my crewmembers ;)\nI checked the achievements and there are a lot of ways to finish this game. I'm thinking about playing it again, with some different approaches to some situations.\n\nThe story begins with a hostile attack and a murder and unfolds after that. I liked the story, a lot! More games/episodes are coming as this story ends with a cliffhanger. I'm looking forward to it!\n(I cant tell more about the story without giving away too much.)\n\nSome points you might find interesting:\n\n* FPS\nJust a small part though this might be more important in the coming games. You have a wide arsenal of weapons, all with different specs. You have guns to kill and guns to capture. Whatever you choose will ofcourse change the outcome.\nI had 2 battles in this game and 1 tutorial. It aint CSGO or COD but its ok.\n* Graphics\nlooking good but nothing fancy, kinda like an interactive comic. Not childish in any way though.\n* Sound\nVoiceacting is great. Lot of different accents, all very convincing.\nSoundtrack and effects are ok.\n* Replayability\nDefinately! I checked the achievements after completing this and I saw their are many different outcomes to specific situations.\n\nOverall\nExcellent game and I have no regrets buying this. The 6-man dev team did a great job and reacted honest and adequate when they found out people were experiencing bugs.  The story, for me the most important part, is great and well told.

This isn’t a typical RPG though.  There are no levels or experience points.  The game isn’t designed around the combat, skills, or even the relationships.  It’s designed around the personalities of the characters.  The joy of this game comes from the fun visuals and most importantly the diverse and talented voice actors.  The dialog is something to be savored rather than skipped though.  The voice talent and fun visuals made me really fall for this game but I can’t fully recommend it yet.  If you buy Consortium you will love it eventually but the game had several very frustrating bugs and I spent more than 2 hours finding a work around for one.  Once the developers work this out the game will be great.  Buy this game now if you love deep backstory, plot, and character development.  Buy this game next month if you just like RPGs.\n","January 9, 2014","true","5.0"," 72 of 93 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","72","93","0","1"

In my frustration i wrote a negative review because of its near unplayable state.\n\nInterdimensional Studios themselves admited ( and apologized ) that "Consortium's" launch was horribly buggy and thankfully this is no longer the case. With all their hard work and dedication to the project all bugs (game-breaking or just weird) are now gone.\n\nI intended on fully editing this review if the problems were solved and now they have.\n\nI can best describe 'Consortium' as a mix of the original Star Trek and Mass Effect with the shooting mechanics and engine of Half Life 2 and if that mix doesn't sound good to you ( or you didn't like any of these examples ) then it's hard to recommend. However if you're looking for epic 1st person sci-fi romp with an emphasis on story, dialogue, player choice story and wrapped up with some decent shooting mechanics look no further.\n\n'Consortium' is also the first in a trilogy and only lasts about 10 hours at the most, however it never feels "too short" and i'm very excited for what's to come. The story is brilliantly written, the game has marvelous presentation and the characters throughout the adventure are interesting and their dialogue throughout it is well done. Combat is a bit like an old school shooter mixed with Half-Life 2 (which i find works well enough) but it's hardly the focus of the game.\n\nNo, the focus of 'Consortium' is the interactions between you and the other crew aboard the ship with multiple dialogue choices and the dire consequences for most of them, and Interdermentional studios have done it brilliantly. Even with my previous frustration at launch it's obvious how far 'Consortium' has come and the Master Edition truly is worth anyone's time especially for only $20.\n\nThis is the type of game i've been wanting ever since Mass Effect came out, and it certainly doesn't disappoint.","January 8, 2014","true","4.6"," 99 of 139 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","99","139","0","8"

These choices have a significant impact in how things play out and what scenarios you are put in. Something that is very lacking in today's modern games. Too many games claim to give you freedom of choice however many of these games lead you to the exact same place/story segment and it feels cheap. Consortium however is different, decisions you make in the beginning of the game can adversely affect you later on without you knowing it. I have played through this game a few times now and I am very impressed with the degree of how the decisions you make have a major impact on what goes on.\n\n+ Its one thing to have choices, but if the scenarios are boring the game wouldn't be interesting. Consortium does a great job of putting you in some really great situations. These situations will really make you think and the outcomes are not always so obvious.\n\n+ The developers really wanted to explain everything in the game. The game features an in-game console that explains a lot of the history /characters/story to really immerse you in the game. In addition all the characters seem to act realistically given their surroundings. It wasn't until I went online and read what other people were seeing that it made me go back into the game to see how much attention to detail the developers put into such a small game.\n\n+Good replay value, play the game again and choose different options, speak to people differently and see what happens!\n\n+ Good voice acting\n\n+ I was very surprised by how good the music is.\n\n+ Included is a virtual reality mini game, it is completely optional and provides a nice change of pace to a game that is mostly about talking to people.\n\nThe Average:\n\nThe developers included partial controller support, sadly the controller doesn't seem to work in menus/inventory making controller support rather useless. You are given two choices of button layouts, you cannot remap any buttons for the controller. Just stick with keyboard/mouse.\n\nThe art style is rather ugly. It just doesn't look right, the game isn't very impressive technically either. I understand this is an independent developer and they don't have a big budget but that doesn't really excuse them for choosing such a poor art style.\n\nUser interface looks cheap.\n\nMost of the back story is hidden behind information console.\n\nSomewhat short if you don't bother to read anything in the information console.\n\nThe Bad\n\nIn a game that is all about making choices and replaying the game to see how things play out differently, it would be nice to skip dialogue. Having to listen to the same things over and over again is awful.\n\nConclusion\nI really want the is game to do well because the game has some really good design decision wrapped up in a poor looking presentation.","February 8, 2015","true","14.9"," 32 of 38 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","32","38","0","1"

A very promising game, but there are issues.  The game runs terribly, I've got every setting turned down to "low" or "off" and I've still got framerate issues.  I'm no graphics ♥♥♥♥♥, but it would be nice if the game at least ran smoothly.  It's keeping me from getting immersed into the story.  However the devs claim to be working on a patch, and I'll take their word on that for the time being\n\nThe combat seems lacking, but I didn't buy this game for combat and I'm more interested in taking the non-lethal route anyway.\n\nDialogue/writing.  I'm VERY early in the game yet, but this ain't no Mass Effect 1 & 2 (we shall never speak of 3) but it is passable, and the characters seem likable enough so far (though the doc is either poorly acted or intentionally creepy, I won't be shocked if that's a plot point)\n\nSTILL, this game seems interesting, and I'd rather be playing this than a Call of Duty, or a Bioshock clone, or whatever else is "new" that I've already played 4,000 times before, so I'm going to give it a tenative recommend.","January 9, 2014","true","5.7"," 25 of 31 people (81%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","81","25","31","3","3"

(Forgetting about the fact I've been waiting for a sequel for AGES)\nToo many games are forgettable in my opinion.  Especially when Steam has SO MANY.  This one however, was totally worth it ;)\n\nLet's skip to the breakdown:\n+ Great background music by Jeremy Soule and free soundtrack download\n+ Stanley's Parable level of unique choices with different outcomes\n+ Unique setting (it's on a plane?)\n+ Great voiced characters\n+ Detailed story with lively characters\n+ Did I mention the story?\n\n- The graphical style is unusual.  It's not BAD, it just doesn't look real\n- Fights while few, are fast, frantic and unwieldy\n- I ran into some weird graphical issues when I first played, restarting worked for me\n- A single playthrough is SHORT!  And the sequel, well I've been waiting forever!!\n\n+ The sequel is about to make its kickstart debut... FINALLY!\n\nThe real fun of this game is in blindly throwing yourself into a detailed new universe, the game admitting that, and enjoying how the world reacts to your choices.\n\nSpoiler example:\nWhat would happen if you started a new game, and didn't know much about your environment, who the NPCs were, ... even what your name was?  lol Actually that's typical, but expect this game to call you out on it if you're obvious.\n\nI recently played Undertale and it reminded of this game, choice-wise.  That's praise.\n\nAnyway, I say it's definitely worth a shot if it sounds at all interesting to you.  With TallTale taking the lead on games like this, it's nice to have new blood.

As soon as I'm done, I want to start the game again and try different things. This game is incredibly successful at engaging a lot more of my brain and 'gut feelings' than most. I'm not sure that I've ever played a game that gave the player such respect while also commanding so much responsibility.\n\nWithout revealing too much; you're thrown (somewhat 'naked') into a key role during a specific series of events. Your decisions and actions can sway how events unfold and also how the game is to be played. In most games, if you stray too far from what they want to show you, the game tugs harshly at your leash or essentially shuts down and waits for you to come back. Not so, here! As far as I can tell, the only time you're really yanked out of the proceedings is if your character dies. Then, you can load up an auto-save from earlier and try something else. That's only happened to me once so far. Basically, if you bumble, the game unfolds in a logical way as it would if someone in your position bumbled in an actual situation like this, if that makes sense.\n\nWhat kind of a game is it? Well, it's a shooter if you want it to be...I guess. It's a missile defense game sometimes. It's a 'cool special agent on a plane' social simulator. It's an alternate future reality quantum leap homage thingiemadoop.","January 1, 2015","true","3.1"," 23 of 28 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","23","28","0","0"

When originally released, it was filled with game-breaking bugs. Now, after many patches, it has some minor bugs, occasional graphical glitches, and rare crashes remaining, but for the most part it works. However the game is only 3 hours long and the replayability isn't all that great. You may profitably replay it once, or maybe twice. And it isn't a complete game; very few of the story elements are really resolved by the time you get to the end. It just tells you to buy the next game. The game is so short in fact that you get to the mission briefing for your first mission about 15 minutes before the end of the game, and you never get to play that mission. Apparently your first mission as a Bishop is in a sequel that may or may not ever be released.\n\nSome people say the game is ugly, but I find the graphics to be stylish. The voice acting is mostly good.\n\nIn short, it's kind of fun to talk to people, but it's a complete rip-off at $20 for 3 hours of gameplay that result in nothing really being resolved. If you can get it for $5 or less, go for it. Otherwise, I can't recommend this game.","July 9, 2014","false","5.6"," 63 of 100 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","63","100","0","11"

The game is somewhat unique in the fact that the world itself from what I've played continues through time like it's an actual world, now I have only played through it once so I don't know if it actually does that but it does it enough to feel alive. It's inspired by various sources but I'd say what has it inspired the most is probably choose your own adventure books, moreso then a particular game. Yes you can say Mass Effect, Yes you can say Deus Ex but a lot of these games while much longer don't quite encapture the amount of stuff you can actually do to affect the game's world the way Consortium does.\n\nAs much as I personally love this game, if you're looking for your typical action RPG this, unfortunately for you is not it, and by the end you may end up feeling like you bought a preview for what's to come as it's a trilogy that will yes, have a continual storyline. So for folks that are looking for a bit more meat I'd pass for now, check on the sequel when it comes out and buy both.

You are perfectly capable of shooting your way through the game as well, and both are viable ways to solve problems.\n\nTo complement all of this is a large cast of complex characters. I found myself reloading saves just because I was interested in exploring more dialogue options. The world of Consortium feels very alive and complex, hell, there's an in-game database that has an absolutely vast amount of backstory and supplementary material that you could spend a day reading.\n\nIf you've played the Mass Effect games, there's a strong chance you'll enjoy this game.

However, I managed to play through the game and fighting only once.  That is a rare thing, a RPG which actually let you forge a path, so far i beleive there are not that many opportunities to fight (this is episode 1, the others promise more action i think but thats speculation, there's also computer simulations for more action if needed). Although there was not much action, the storytelling was exelent. You actually get invested with the people you meet and the action you take. The characters you interact with also have a 'beyond highschool' mindset, and will speak about various things/subject (aka they do more than flirt with each others and reference the same poppular things). For instance a character is an addict to an online MMO and spen most of her time playing it. If confronted about that, other character may tell their opinion but not get invested too much as they are busy at that time. I had fun and will definitely at least replay once. I would say that the game is possibly closer to a visual novel than a full fledged action game, for part 1 at least. This does not take away from the experience, luckily.

However, even if I'd set my expectations sky high, I don't think this game would have disappointed me.\n\nFirst off, the game is rather pretty; the cel shaded graphics will likely help the game retain playability for a long time, so if you don't have the money to spend now, you can always wait for the next sale. Bonus: The developers have said there will be future episodes of Consortium that build upon the events of this game, so waiting for that may be in your best interest if you're a binge gamer.\n\nAs for the story, it feels pretty natural. If you're unfamiliar, the game puts you in the body of a person in the future. The game itself pretends that this is actually happening, so when you have to pretend you know what is going on, it feels legitimate. However, that also means that on future playthroughs, you can react to situations differently as you are more familiar with the game's lore. The game is built with this concept in mind, which makes it extremely replayable. On that note, I recommend playing the game through, living with each decision you make, rather than reloading to see how consequences change. In the amount of time I spent watching the loading screen, I probably could have played the game through at least one or possibly two more times.\n\nThe situtations the game puts you in have the feel of action-packed, suspensful movie scenes, and the game does a darned good job making you feel as if you were really in the thick of things. Also, since you're not the captain, you're not always the center of attention. In my opinion, this feeling adds another layer of deptht to the game as it made me feel more like a part of the crew, as opposed to having me order people around, Kirk-style.\n\nI can't speak much for the combat because the game gives you the options to not have to fight, except for one "air combat" mission. The controls in general felt solid. There's nothing that felt innovative here, but nothing that felt broken.\n\nThe only time the game didn't feel smooth were when I accidentally triggered an event that moved the story forward before I meant to. This is a chronic issue I have in games and may speak more about me than it does about the game.\n\nBottom Line/TL;DR: If you want to feel like you're actually in a futuristic crew on a ship flying around on missions, then this game is likely to be right up your alley. The conversation choices and reactions to actions you take feel natural and make you feel like you really are hijacking the body of someone in the future.","January 5, 2015","true","7.8"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","3"

Players were outraged because the game offered them a glimpse of something truly awesome and then snatched it away, right as the game came to an end. To be fair to the trilogy, what players felt they deserved was something most a games don't even try to provide: a true sense of player agency.\n\nThere's an obvious reason why giving players non-trivial choices is so rare. It's super hard. Every time a player makes a meaningful choice, the developer has to create all of the content for the path they chose and all of the content for the path they might not ever experience. The amount of content that needs to be written is literally exponential to the amount of content that the player experiences.\n\nCONSORTIUM ambitiously tries to meet this goal and it actually mostly succeeds. The most common complaint is that it's short. Of course it's short. It has to be. For every chunk of the game that you see, the devs had to make many that you don't. This branched story structure is essential for creating the kind of fun anxiety that comes from making real choices with incomplete information. The tradeoff is that you're paying for a lot of content that you'll never see.\n\nThe developers have tried to address this issue by making the game highly re-playable. Not only can you return to saved games to check out different paths, some elements of the game are actually different on different playthroughs. This solution sort of works, but the bulk of the dialogue never changes so replays can feel pretty tedious. The repetitiveness feels especially punishing when you have to re-load a game due to finicky dialogue and quest triggers. The game shipped with a ton of bugs, many of which are now fixed, but the triggers still require some babysitting.\n\nOverall, it's an ambitious game and a worthwhile experience. I'll definitely check out the sequel.\n\nOne final thought: CONSORTIUM advertized a large library of in-game text to read. It's theoretically optional, but there is information in there that can affect your game. Another important thing to know about it is that it's extremely boring. As much fun as I had playing the game, the world outside the aircraft is not particularly compelling.","January 21, 2014","true","26.5"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","11","15","0","1"

If you've ever played Deus Ex or Mass Effect and loved the dialogue options but been disappointed that it wasn't more in depth, this is the game for you. I have already played this game through three times and I'm still discovering things I missed in previous playthroughs.\n\nIn summary, a brilliant experience for the kind of person who really likes to delve into the backstory of different universes as well as experiment with dialogue and decision trees.","February 1, 2014","true","11.3"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","11","15","0","0"

There's enough exposition to allow you to understand the ship and the world's current situation, but there remains the uneasy feeling that, being a traveller from another dimension, you really are out of your depth, and learning more is key to getting a grip on what's going on.\n\nThe voice acting is very good, and the usual tropes are avoided in the cast of well-rounded, interesting characters. A special mention must also be given to the soundtrack, which heightens tension in all the right places. "Almost as good as Morrowind's OST," I mused, before I closed the game and discovered it was Jeremy Soule himself who composed Consortium's score. Excellent selection, developers; I'll be buying the soundtrack shortly!\n\nThe gunplay, admittedly, feels a little janky, and the inventory menu was confusing in my opinion. This gave me the incentive to avoid fights and settle problems using diplomacy and cunning - I think this ended up being the better choice, but if combat is mandatory in the second game as I reckon it will be, I hope the HUD improves. However, it wasn't a major concern for me.\n\nAll in all, I'm really looking forward to the next installment of this. The developers of this game have created something brilliant - I hate to make comparisons, but I can't help but draw a parallel between this and the story-driven TellTalle games of recent years. If you like those, you will LOVE Consortium.\n\nNow, I have some mysteries to solve...","December 19, 2014","true","6.8"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

Well first off I will say that I really enjoyed the play throughs I have made so far.\n\nConsortium puts you - Quantum Leap style - in the body of an operative called Bishop-6 onboard a high tech aircraft flying to Dublin. The entire game takes place during the flight and can play out differently every time depending on your actions. There are no right or wrong actions, just different versions of reality. You are confronted with a number of plots to solve - or ignore - which I won't spoiler. What I will say is that they are excellent, and enjoyable.\n\nConsortium is an excellent example of the "One Block RPG" where everything takes place in a small area with well developed characters but within that scope the player has great freedom. Consortium benefits from many play throughs as you explore diferent possibilities and in fact the game makes a virtue of this and saves them as detailed versions for you to look back on.\n\nOh did I mention it has a soundtrack by Jeremy Soule?\n\nThe game had a rough launch - the team who developed it are very small - but they stuck with ut  and turned it into a gem that should not be missed.\n\nIf you like good, thoughtful RPGs: buy it. If you love interesting sci-fi setups: buy it. If you like good writing: buy it, If you like soundtracks by Jeremy Soule: buy it.\n\nI'm going to go and have another playthrough now.","December 30, 2014","true","6.6"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","2"

I'm going to say this flat out, I cannot recommend this game to everyone, and a part of me still regrets spending the $20 I had on it. That being said, this isn't a bad game, but it also is not a very good one. Consortium suffers from a wide array of issues, but even with all of them, I cannot say I did not enjoy my time spent with it, it just honestly feels incomplete. It is a very different RPG experience you will not get from a lot of other games, but it has so many issues its hard to say whether or not they justify it's good points.\n\nConsortium is a FPS and also a Sci-Fi RPG. You play as a person living in the 20th century who uses a device to travel to the future of a parallel universe. You awake onboard a space ship with the task of simply living in this world. The ship is fairly small and leaves little to be explored, but all the characters on this ship are interesting for various reasons. Some people are average workers with a good personality, while some are just ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, and even one is a religious extremist. If you are into games with a heavy focus on dialogue, you might be interested in this title, the problem is that most of the said dialogue includes details of the people onboard, and not on the world you are living in. This can be a huge let down for people, as you spend most of your play time learning about people, with no depth for anything else. However, even with the lacking explanation of the world, the dialogue is pretty damn good, and almost every voice actor plays their character perfectly, it honestly is some of the best voice acting I've seen in a game, which is really impressive for such a low budget title.\n\nWhen you aren't walking around, talking, and making decisions ( which actually do have a large impact on the gameplay, and really encourages multiple playthroughs ) you are fighting... MAYBE. This I feel is one of the strongest aspects of the game, you are given the decision of lethal or non-lethal combat, or skipping combat entirely. You will be placed in a situation where combat is about to happen, but if you make the correct decisions in the dialogue trees, you can talk your way out of it. This is something rarely even seen in a game, and it really is refreshing to see it here. That being said, violence is definitely an option, and if you don't want to talk your way out of something, opening fire on anything that lies in your way is an option, which really is the best part about this game, options. You are constantly deciding things, how to interact with other people, how you are going to deal with enemies, its all dependent on what YOU want to do, which is something that should be present in other RPGs.\n\nBut even with all of these good things the game offers, it has a lot of problems that are persistent throughout your whole play through. The game, while having an interesting and colorful art style, is ugly and outdated. Its not really a problem for me, and may not be for others, but it really is an absolute fact. The game is buggy, you can get stuck in walls, characters will fade through door ways, dialogue choices may disappear which will cause a reload, it really is a mess. Apparently it is not as bad as before, but it still is a huge issue. The inventory management is annoying, it uses an "energy" system. You hold energy to heal and repair armor, and also use the non-lethal weapon. Energy takes up inventory space, which means carrying even 50% energy will really limit your choices of weaponry and items. Everything is just too heavy, and I can see this being an issue in the sequels if more combat takes place. Yes combat doesn't take up that much of the game, but I still feel it is an issue. I think worst of all is how short the game is, I finished it in about 4 hours. Granted, I skipped the like 3 side quests, mainly because I couldn't figure out what to do for some of them. Yes, it has high replayability, and it is a great experience, but the price of $20 honestly leaves a bad taste in my mouth.\n\nIf you want to play a game that has a huge focus on dialogue and choices, and don't mind how short it is, this game is something you should look at, even people who are looking this style of gameplay may or may not enjoy this experience, so just be cautious. If you are willing to spend $20 on a risk, or it goes on sale, go for it. Otherwise, you're probably better of skipping it.\n","March 20, 2014","false","4.2"," 17 of 29 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","17","29","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/abedsbrother/recommended/264240/","abedsbrother","AbedsBrother","http://steamcommunity.com/id/abedsbrother/","525 products in account","Consortium is a short, dialogue-driven indie drama defined by the choices you make. Short, because its length feels like an episode rather than a full game (took me four hours to complete a run-through). You have the ability via some satellite thingy to travel into the future and inhabit the body of someone else in that future. You wake up in a cabin aboard a plane / airship and have to immediately come to grips with your new surroundings. The entire game is spent aboard this plane; you'll look for a traitor among the crew, negotiate with a mercenary, and try to keep the plane repaired and running. The moment gameplay starts, the conversations and choices begin.\nYou can view the opening of the game here.\n\nWhich are two of the primary strengths of Consortium. Choices abound, and result in genuinely different outcomes – NOT the same out come with minor variations. This means that, though short, replayability is high. There are a lot of dialogue options, with staying silent being a valid choice as well. With so much talking, the voice acting needs to be top-notch, and it is. A few characters seem a little flat, but the primary characters are unique and reactive. There are some very funny sci-fi references as well; like when you find someone dead, one of the conversation choices is, “He's wearing a red shirt; why should I care?” (Star Trek fans will know.)\n\nA supporting strength of Consortium is the lore. This is never forced on you – you have to go find it – but there are questions that can be asked, and bulletins to read that explain a lot of the world you find yourself in. Ranks are modeled on chess pieces (you play as a “bishop,” while answering to a “rook,” and primary crew are “pawns”). And gun play is good, though shooting doesn't need to happen much if you don't make certain choices. I did choose the more violent route, and the shoot-out on three decks of a plane / airship, blacked out, with only red emergency lights pulsing on and off, was a creepy yet exhilarating setting for a deadly game of cat and mouse.\n\nThe three decks of the plane / airship are fully explorable (including the crawl spaces). Characters are generally well-modeled, though assets are re-used frequently (while every character's face is different, all men have the same body type, as do women). The graphics and environment are fully 3-D, which is an interesting choice since the game could have gotten away with being a 2-D point-and-click (would have lost that feeling of freedom to explore if the devs had done that, though). The graphics quality is plain but utilitarian; it fits the setting.\n\nUsually a game's shortness would count heavily against it, but the high level of replayability counters that. Go into Consortium expecting dialogue-driven drama, and you'll easily get your money's worth. The game ends on a cliffhanger, but with the sequel recently Kickstarted, I hope the next episode comes soon! Value-wise, worth getting on sale for around $5, but if you want to support the developers, consider purchasing at full cost. Highly recommended.\n\nNote about crashes:\nI had a few where the game would just lock up and CTD. I set the game to run in Windows XP SP3 compatibility mode, and the crashes disappeared.

There is also an impressive amount of player agency within the small bounds of the scenario. The game's simple aesthetic mostly works well, though the bare animations do detract from immersion.\n\nUnfortunately the core experience of this game explicitly relies on save scumming (saving and loading to explore different gameplay options) and while saving is quick, the slow loading times are immersion-breaking when you try to follow the game's instruction to explore conversation trees. This is the main issue with the game as it stands: exploring the many complex branching conversations central to the game is changed from an exciting and fun experience into a slog.\n\nA few other, mostly minor, issues also detract from the game. Many conversations seem to just involve finding what to say to each character to increase their alignment- though many obvious exceptions make this a minor gripe and the game is still miles better than most other games in this regard. Combat is also limited, but functional, and given the scope and tone of the game the slight awkwardness may be appropriate. Finally, game-breaking bugs do exist but fortunately the developer seems to be active in supporting and fixing those as they are encountered.\n\nCONSORTIUM is pushing forward the boundaries of the art, and is certainly worthwhile. The game brings some intriguing ideas and a good story to the table, but sadly the load issue combined with other mechanical shortcomings were enough to push it slightly over the boundary to 'not-fun' for me. In my opinion it is worth supporting this game solely for the direction it is headed, but I would not recommend it to friends as a fun way to spend some time.","January 24","false","7.1"," 13 of 23 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","13","23","0","0"

If you like real time unskippable cut scenes, you'll love this. There's a lot of gushing over this being dynamic or choices with consquences, but that's significantly overstated.\n\nThe game developers packed a crap ton of text into the onboard computers, so... if you want you can read over twenty five six page articles about something about the setting this is suppose to take place in. The story takes place on a fairly claustrophobic cartoon ship and the combat mechanic is weak. The story is kinda meta and references you playing a game, but as like a serious acknowledgement woven into the story rather than tonge in cheek. There's a lame murder mystery thing, confused only by the fact all the characters have identical titles with a number and look pretty much the same too. The definitive "clue" makes no sense in the context of a saboteur committing murder. Contrived mystery is really central to what little there is here, so it shouldn't be a spoiler to say that aspect falls flat. Rest of the game is go from one cut scene to another cut scene. Sometimes you can walk away in the middle of a conversation, sometimes the door inexplicably locks behind you.\n\nAfter sitting through an eye rolling mission briefing about Osama Bin Laden's son taking a building hostage, you paratrooper from the plane and the game ends before it starts.\n\nIt probably would be an alright tutorial or intro to a game, but this probably shouldn't have been released as if it was a real game. I can't in good conscious recommend this to a general audience. Go play the Stanley Parable if you want an unconventional narrative and an exploration into player choice.","January 16","false","6.9"," 16 of 29 people (55%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","55","16","29","2","1"

The best way I can put this game into perspective is to think of the Mass effect series games, reduces its scope to just one setting but focus entirely on dialogues choices and characters interaction.  The setting you are playing on, a huge command plane similar to the BUS in Agents of SHIELD, is full of interesting characters, of which all of them are voiced over. The people you encountered are all believable; each has interesting thing to say either about themselves, their colleagues and the world around them. Conservations seem life-like as the choices are timed so you can’t be holding on to decide what to say next, and “say nothing” is always present for all dialogue options. You can even walk away during a conversation and the characters would react to it. Talking to them is a lot of fun; the dialogues are entertaining as well as giving background story about the world. There’s even a part which your answer is breaking the fourth wall, and at first it seem like a joke response to one of the character inquiry but to my surprise, later on the game the character actually referred back to your response and if you persist  enough will become one of the subplot.\n\nNow the story, essentially you are trying to solve a murder happened shortly while you are on board but as the story unfold it hinted on a larger mystery / conspiracy hangs in the shadow.  The story is engaging but slow at the beginning, it picked up pace around the middle but ended in a cliff hanger. I would say that’s the only negative thing about the game.\n\nCombat is simple and basic but it is not irrelevant. It does feel dated as it is still using the source engine.  With that said combat has a choice of lethal and non-lethal and a fairly basic inventory system. But seeing that you can actually complete the game without firing a single shot, there is definitely less emphasis on combat.\n\nAll in all I would definitely recommend this game as it mixed rpg, adventure game, and FPS into something that is quite unique.\n","December 20, 2014","true","2.4"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Your first clue is that it claims to be real. The deal is, you used a system by iDGi to take control of Bishop-6, a general-operations crewmember aboard the Zenlilth in the year 2043. The Zenlilth is a highly advanced plane containing a chess-based heirarchy, all working for the leaders of Consortium, King and Queen. Your purpose is to do stuff, and try not to screw up the plane too badly through traitors, mercenary attacks, and intrigue. There's even a section where the high leader of Consortium calls you specifically to tell you not to kill the guy you're controlling. It is, in my opinion, well-written and creative, and if Bioware RPG's are too busy for you, this is much more story-focused and less shooting and picking flowers.\nThe combat is unique, and takes backstage. As a "Bishop", you are supposed to know how to fight, but in the only big combat scene of the game people get a bit annoyed if you kill too many people (especially the leader). Story is unique and immersive, the ending is incredibly strange and yet not out of place. So much detail is put into a facade of reality that the same section of a game might be experienced with bad space/time continuum connection the first time, and some static the next.

I've played through it once already and just started a second playthrough, and I think I'll continue playing it beyond that. No point in explaining what the game is (just read the store page), but I will say that they ♥♥♥♥ing nailed it.\n\nStarting off with the writing, I was blown away. The lore is insanely extensive, which you can find by just playing the game or accessing the terminal on the ship or reading the "iDGi-1 Discoveries" compedium (included with the game for free). It's rare to see a game take its lore as seriously as this one does. The actual writing in the game's story is great as well, with characters having their own distinct personalities (as they should) - and the way you interact with (or don't) with these characters actually has an impact on the way they treat you and even the outcome of the story. The branching paths of the story not only make replayability possible, but they seem designed around taking advantage of replayability (and replaying actually fits the lore!) - a good comparison (apparently) is Undertale.\n\nGameplay-wise, the game is mostly talking to people. There are a few combat scenarios, one being in a virtual world, but for the most part you won't do much shooting. The combat itself can be approached in multiple ways, offering lethal, non-lethal, or a little of both. This also has a noticeable impact on the game and its world. The actual combat mechanics aren't anything amazing and are rarely used, so you probably shouldn't waste what little inventory space you have trying to carry an entire armory.\n\nNow the complaints! At times, the voice acting was particularly hammy - sometimes even outright bad. Most of the time it was just decent. Visually, the game was a headache - at least at first. I can appreciate an art style but the shadows and lighting just seemed to detract from everything, and it just felt like they were progressing backwards in their art direction. The UI is especially messy, and the main menu is an eyesore. I feel like this could be attributed to the engine, as Source is and was pretty severely dated at the time of this game's release. At least the sequel seems to be rectifying that.\n\nTo quickly address the length, it is short. I can see how some might think 3-5 hours is petty for a $15 game, but with the amount of replayability and the fact that replaying actually changes things, I'm alright with that price.\n\nIs it worth the money? Absolutely. I'm actually ashamed I got this for free, and would have gladly paid for it had I known it was this good (though I did back the sequel on Kickstarter, as should you if you're reading this within 24 days of posting).","January 26","true","5.6"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/f-ingsweet/recommended/264240/","f-ingsweet","Doctor Smiles","http://steamcommunity.com/id/f-ingsweet/","650 products in account","Today, I’m talking about a little first-person action-adventure game called CONSORTIUM. Developed and self-published by Interdimensional Games, Inc. The games development had its start in a successful Kickstarter campaign, which leads us to what we have today. CONSORTIUM’s story starts off with you, the player, travelling forward through time, and to a parallel universe, thanks to a satellite that allows us to connect to a sentient A.I. that exists in the other universe. In this future universe, it seems that everything is just about perfect. Global hunger, energy, and poverty problems has been resolved for the most part, and all forms of war have almost completely ceased. We have people living in space, on the moon, on Mars, you name it. But can things ever really be perfect?\n\nConsortium1You take the role of someone named Bishop Six, a field agent and peacekeeper of sorts in the Consortium, a society dedicated to protecting the galaxy or something. But all is not well, as soon after you arrive on your ship, the Zenlil, one of your shipmates is found dead in their bunkroom. Believing them to have been murdered by another shipmate, you are commanded to begin interrogating your shipmates to find out who the traitor is. If that weren’t enough, you also have the problem of a band of outlaws currently looking to take down your ship. It’s up to you to solve the mystery behind the murder, and take down the outlaws, among other things. But you better watch out, nobody can know where you’re really from, otherwise you might end up causing a temporal breakdown and destroy the universe!\n\nSo, let me tell you right now: Gameplay is where this game really shines. CONSORTIUM really isn’t an action game, so much as it is an immersive story told through its great character dialogue, its mysteries, and the in-game lore that comes with it. You communicate to the other characters on the ship through simple button presses, similar to a Telltale game. Alternatively, you can choose to say nothing and make everything awkward with your constant silence. Like I said before, one of the major goals is trying to find out who the murderer on your ship is, but naturally, things can never just be that simple. News gets spread fast on Zenlil, and before you know it, everybody on the ship knows what has happened, which naturally freaks them out. As you question and get to know your shipmates, you find that quite a few of them are less trustworthy than they appear, and others seem way too nervous or in some cases, optimistic about the whole situation. But, for those of you out there who decide that there isn’t enough shooting involved, there ARE action segments included with the game. Depending on how you choose to interact with other characters, you will be forced to engage in combat with bloodthirsty mercenaries who invade your ship, or shoot down enemy spaceships. You are also given the choice of capturing, or outright killing their leader. Just remember: Gameplay, as well as the story itself, might turn out differently depending on what you’ve chosen to do or not do.Consortium3\n\nEverything looks decent in terms of graphics, but the game was built on the constantly aging Source Engine, so you probably shouldn’t expect anything too fancy. Because it IS Source though, you can be almost certain that CONSORTIUM will run on even the lowest-end of gaming PCs. The sound effects are pretty good too, really helping encapsulate that claustrophobic feeling of being on a small little spaceship. The music is absolutely fantastic, but what do you expect when it’s composed by none other than Jeremy Soule, the same guy who did the music for such great games as Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, and Knights of the Old Republic? The developers really use the music to their advantage here when it comes to telling the story, and really puts an emphasis on the importance of what’s going on around you.\n\nIf there was one major flaw I could point out about this game, it’s that it was too short for my tastes. If you want a short, but good little immersive plot-central game, I recommend you try out CONSORTIUM. It’s currently on sale on Steam for $19.99.\n\nhttp://wtbfun.com/consortium-review/","October 15, 2014","true","6.7"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

In the end, the actual "game" is extremely lacking and the best bits really leave you wanting more. It might have a great sequel, but as it is, I can't recommend it.\n\nThe bad stuff. So there isn't really a game here. There are the concepts of a FPS intermixed and there are even a couple VR training sessions that show off a functional shooter. It's not great, but it's functional. Oh and there's a bug where apparently the AI cannot figure out where you are if you go up two ramps from the starting level.\n\nIn the game itself, there are at most two parts that can involve combat. If you play "correctly," there will be no combat though. If you don't, it's again not very good combat.\n\nSo the experience rests firmly on the story and the interactions. The actual writing of all of the lines is pretty good overall with respectable voice acting. There just isn't any real motivating force past either advancing the game or I don't have anything better to do to actually play along. There is a ton of information you clearly are left out of, but the game never really lets you into that. Maybe with some more context or something, I would care, but as presented, I just don't.\n\nSo that sounds like all of the game. Why would this be hard for me to say yes or no to the recommend to it? It sounds boring to bad overall.\n\nThere are glimmers of something great in here. The meta story could be actually pretty interesting. I would love for there to be more to it. At the end, it even seemed to be coming through a bit.\n\nThere actually seem to be characters in this game. People have glimmers of personalities and conflicts. That all seems great. No one happens to develop anywhere near enough for me to care about them, but I can see things there.\n\nThe entire game takes place on one (large) plane. I love that in such a condensed space, you can have quite a few interactions and it felt decently real (as in a reasonable series of events). Hell, even the plane felt appropriate where there were places for people to sleep and relax and eat and such while remaining very tight and small. Unfortunately those interactions all end up being boring.\n\nSo I really want to see what comes of the sequel which I believe starts kickstarting soon. This isn't the game I wanted to play, but it is a world I'm interesting in revisiting.","December 22, 2015","false","4.0"," 58 of 113 people (51%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","51","58","113","5","0"

I didn't expect it but it was really fun talking with all the crew and finding out whodunit.

Browsing through main terminal was mainly boring because most of the texts were written as interviews with too much beating around the bush (I would prefer shorter news-like summaries).

You're a traveller to a parallel universe's Earth where you play as a Bishop (lorewise, something between secret agent and one man army) on his first day on duty, aboard a plane called the Zenlil. From the start, you will be exploring highly branching conversation options with many of the crew's members. The only thing I had heard about the gameplay before going in was that "everything you do has a consequence", and I found that to be largely true.\n\nThe somewhat limited duration of the narration means you don't get to know all of the characters in depth; the lower-ranking servicemen in particular can be one-dimensional. For those you do get to know, you learn enough of to really want to see how they'd react to future situations as well. The voice acting is solid throughout.\n\nEverything in the graphics department feels source engine-ish. On the bright side, even as a player who will sometimes not play certain games solely because of the graphics, they didn't bother me too much. They got the job done well enough, and there was enough detail put in that they weren't bland.\n\nThe combat is clunky at best, and is by far the game's weakest point, but its presence does help with the setting, which was lovingly crafted (in that it'd be harder to believe your tough enforcer background without the combat scenes to prove you're as good as they say you are/should be).\n\nAlso, there's a news article database where you can read articles on the world's lore, many of them simply there for the curious.\n\nOverall, this was a very pleasant experience for me. I'd say it's a must-play for anyone looking for a great narrative delivered in a fresh way.","May 31","true","8.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If you can look beyond the flaws, which I personally haven't really suffered, it's a fantastic game. I've only played around 3 hours (so Steam tells me) but I could swear it's been more. It's absolutely astounding, the visuals are interesting, and the world is so rich! There's a computer bank with literally thousands of ebooks in detailing the world. There's so much there I really can't even begin to absorb it. It's got a real diversity in playstyle, too. For example, the big bad of the first act, I looked him up, worked out a bit about his personality, and when speaking to him, played his ego and curiosity. This meant I could defeat him and his army, then his fleet without firing a single bullet or hurting anyone.\nAlternatively, I attempted a more violent approach, but I personally never found that to be the best way. The richness with the way you interact and chat with the characters makes you genuinely develop emotion towards them, not forced emotion, such as in The Walking Dead. They each have their own metric ton of things to say, and your behaviour changes their thoughts towards you, and the same will go for you.\n\nThe setting is very rich, like a Gerry Anderson serial, or something. I was strongly reminded of Spectrum, with the whole codename system and flying base. The only sort of problem with this is that nearly every character is designated as Pawn and then a number. This means I got very confused when investigating an incident that comes out through the game. I actually ended up screwing my alignment utterly with two characters and failing to find the bad guy. This did sort of annoy me, but the game does tell you that regular saves are a good idea, and I decided to not do that to add a more permanent level to my choices.\nI can imagine that there's so many ways to approach this game, so I can't comment on the scope of it. It can also be very tense in some parts, like when you're being interrogated about your name and stuff.\nAll in all, this is one of those games you will love if you can focus past things like attempting the usual tutorial and introduction dialouges with NPCs being met with "Are you feeling okay? You've forgotten everything" and other things. The developers have also promised to fix the bugs that have damaged some people's experience, too.","January 9, 2014","true","10.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I could blab about what everyone else has already said, but I'll just say "ditto" to what the positive reviews are in agreement about. It's a fun experience. If you are wanting a first person shooter, I can promise you this game will not deliver on that front. You play in first person and there are a couple of parts where you may shoot, but they're pretty weak and not very good. I kinda feel like the game doesn't actually need any first person (or third) shooting at all, but I suppose that might be for the sake of empowerment and a bit of realism. Long story short, the shooting sucks, but that's almost non-existent in the game. I feel like I'm making the game sound bad, but I really liked it and will buy the sequel at launch, if/whenever that might be. The story is great and there seem to be a lot of different options and ways some events can play out.

Unfortunately, you'll get little opportunity to see the results of either as the game is little more than part 1 of an episodic story whose part 2 has just entered kickstarter and may never exist. Mildly entertaining for a few hours within its confined space, and its cast is populated with interesting characters whose lives you may occasionally be responsible for.

And I'm talking about the plot as much as the game itself. First off, it looks absolutely terrible, but if you can get over that it looks like it was made by a bunch of amateurs, it's actually kind of interesting.\n\nIt's more or less a walking and talking simulator on a space ship. You interact with the crew in first-person navigating through dialogue trees to solve various mysteries that your crew runs in to. Things happen in real-time as well, so you can actually miss some clues if you weren't at a certain place at a certain time.

It has this slight feeling of leaning towards AAA games, but instead of being a few hour long rollercoaster ride with splosions and lols, it focuses more on ideas while providing more gamplay than usual indie titles.\nStory is the main point in the game, but it has so many branches that it would require a dozen playthroughs to get them all.  In one conversation you can change the whole outcome of the game, then in the next one, you might change it all again, everything depends on your choice. You can be a modest doing-my-job guy or a cocky ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ or a complete weirdo. And again, this may or may not impact the outcome. Honestly before this game I did not think you can make so many changes in story with  2-5 dialogue choices.\nWhile the game has combat which is moderate (and that's what makes the game lean towards AAA FPS rather than being full chit-chat indie title), it can completely avoided through dialogue OR you can turn the game into a bloodbath.\nGraphics aren't impresive but bearable (though somewhat unusual, thus giving some originality to the game), same about sounds.\nCONSORTIUM combines FPS, RPG and mystery solving while being heavily story driven, and makes me wish more AAA titles would adopt such ways of story telling. Not just 2-3 outcomes and call it best game ever with multiple endings, but story that changes with every choice you make.","February 14","true","3.5"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

All good fun. All while trying to figure out what's going on with the metagame without letting slip that you're actually a remote-control operator from the past in 2013.\n\nThe 4th-wall-breaking conceit behind the game is that the entire game is apparently a VR simulator delivered to you at your PC via uplink to a satellite which is making use of tachyon bursts or some ♥♥♥♥ to transmit temporally-adjusted data with an advanced, benevolent AI in the future, allowing you to remote-control an specific, nominated avatar at a fixed point in the future, generating a number of 'branched' alternate realities - based on your decisions - which the AI can track via other satellites in other parallel universes, spreading itself as a single entity functioning on nodes across all of them.\n\nThe rest of the story is best kept a mystery because it's kind of fun getting clues from the crew about the world lore and politics etc, without asking the standard, "Duh, so what is the deal with [Major Faction even a child should know about]?" RPG questions. Those options are still there but the crew will think you're a bit dozy or incompetent because of it, and start to regard you suspiciously or with hostility.\n\nThere's an in-game encyclopedia, but it seems like it only decelerates time to a certain degree to allow you to catch up, meaning that significant events and conversation opportunities can pass by or run their course without you. A veteran can probably see where most of the threads are underlying all this, and manipulate things appropriately, but if you let the smoke and mirrors do their job, I'd say this one's a fun one to get into.\n\nThe mechanics of combat and the rest are not the smoothest, occasionally fiddly and unintuitive, but you can avoid most twitch-dependency if you're so inclined, through game-choices. It's definitely more substance than style, with some kind of dated graphics.  Either way, none of this got in the way for me, so I can pretty confidently give this an overall thumbs up.","January 10, 2014","true","4.3"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","2"

After finishing this game in one session, I realized that I couldn't have been more wrong.\n\nCONSORTIUM is best compaired with story-rich First Person games like the original Deus Ex or the Mass Effect series. First, I'll get to the games strongest points. The Story is kinda weird, but in an awesome way. You make up your own background story, your seekings and how your attitude. Since you are in an to you unknown world, this leads to some comical missunderstanding, both showing a great humor and sometimes breaking the 4th wall. There are also no cutscenes in this game, never robbing you of its control and always being able to decide whether you want to be nice to someone, ♥♥♥♥ them off, just walk away from a conversation or simply staying silent. There are a lot of choices and interessting stuff to explore that you will miss in your first playthrough. In addition, most characters are enough fleshed out to be interessting and have an own personality.\n\nIf you are searching for a good shooter, CONSORTIUM might not be the right choice as I found the combat system and ammo managment to be kinda confusion. It works for the time being but has much room for improvements. If you want a great story, great characters, many choices and an awesome time, get it.\n\nAn amazing masterpiece that only Indiedevelopers can bring forth.","March 2","true","4.4"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","6","11","0","0"

CONSORTIUM is a game that holds itself together with its plot, but that's where it suffered.\n\nTo truly appreciate everything the developers are trying to do, you need to read reems and reems of backstory prose, delve into blogs, read "musings", and even play another game by the same developers. The combat is pretty terrible - it could have been removed or simplified without any real impact to the game. You're constantly thrust into weird scenarios in which everyone else seems to know something you don't. There is a *lot* of talking. Yes, the plot is very important, but sometimes you're going to feel more like a passenger than a driver.\n\nThe concept of the game itself being a gateway into an alternate reality broke my immersion more than anything else. The fourth wall was broken and never ended up being repaired. I soon stopped caring about the characters, the ship, or the mission. The setting just didn't have a good draw. The technology is advanced, and there are some interesting concepts in there, but the game might have been more interesting with more simplification.\n\nSet it on an orbiting spaceship instead of an aeroplane; provide a concise glossary or encylclopaedia; cut down the number of weapons to just one (you don't need a lethal assault rifle with a stun-grenade launcher attachment *and* a stun gun with a lethal laser mode); and most of all - utilise SHOW instead of TELL as a storytelling/exposition tool.\n\nI read all of the database entries in Mass Effect because they enhanced my experience, but in CONSORTIUM the extra information is pretty much mandatory reading if you want to understand what's going on - and the entries are *really* long. Let me put it this way: I can tell you all about the First Contact War and how the Mass Relays work in Mass Effect, but I'm still not sure I know what the Consortium itself actually is, what its ideals are, or how it does what it's supposed to be doing.\n\nConversing with the crew and interacting with them is really important, but if you miss one or two key lines, you can miss a heck of a lot of content (and it really hurts your chances of solving the main mystery).\n\nIf you get excited over the idea of a computer game pretending to be a door into another dimension where you can tell people "I'm from another world, playing a computer game, and you're all characters in that computer game. If I load a saved game, I'm breaking the timeline and creating another alternate reality..." then maybe you'll enjoy CONSORTIUM, but for me it was laid on a bit too thick.","May 18, 2014","false","8.2"," 9 of 17 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","9","17","0","0"

After a four hour experience, there have been dozens of questions created and none really answered.

It would be more accurate to call this the first episode out of three than the first game out of three. The reason I say this is that there is one set of issues to be resolved in this first game in an overall arc.\n\nWhile to me it is a design choice, I feel that where they cut off this game from the next is probably in the wrong spot. Its like TV series that put cliffhangers in seasons when you have no idea if they will get approved for a second season. Instead they should have had it concluded with this arc all wrapped up and mostly just hinting at what comes in the next games.\n\nThe graphics and voice acting for this game are very hit or miss. If you know the original Deus Ex, you have the idea.\n\nComplaints aside, this was actually a pretty fun game. It allows for multiple resolutions to situations and creating circumstances that are affected by past choices. The dialogue is at times funny and the gameply entertaining.\n\nOverall, I would say at $20 it may be a bit steep, but still worth the price.

It completely subverted my expectations about it when I started playing it. I am so used to getting into a game, listening to 10-15 min of expostition and story content that isn't developed or focused on again until the end, that when I went past that point with CONSORTIUM I was slightly taken aback and realized that this truly is a story focused RPG. And best of all it managed to hold my attention to the story throughout the whole game, and only games with great stories have managed that (sadly, there aren't too many of those). Perhaps this is only a side effect of the fact the game is unexpectedly short, even the story itself doesn't have a good conclusion. It is very much dependant on a sequel, however it is not yet clear if we are going to get one.\n\nThe game also has an FPS element to it, which is very much underdeveloped. You have an inventory and equipment system, which you manage throughout the game, so that you will be optimally prepared for combat when the need arises for it. But sadly, that moment doesn't ever come. Not really that is, there are two seperate instances in the game where you can use weapons, in the first one it is clear that the game is pushing you towards the non-violent path. The second one is a bit more mandatory, however you can win that fight simply by waiting it out...\n\nCONSORTIUM reminded me of the times when you are aboard the Normandy in the Mass Effect games and you go around talking to your crewmembers, getting to know them and their story and actually progressing the overall story somewhat. I enjoyed that part in the Mass Effect games, it made me connect with the characters. This game only has that part, but it does it so much better. It would appear they also tried to make the combat part, but given how little importance it has I would imagine they simply didn't have the budget for it.\n\nThere are two major disappointments I have with the game. Firstly, its short lenght, and secondly, the present but never developed FPS portion of the game. Seeing all the possibilities this game has on offer I was starting to think this game would be something truly amazing, with a meaning story that made you care about the characters within it, which would connect all the different missions you would embark upon. However, the sad fact is, the game ends before the first mission truly begins.\n\nWith that said I can also now reveal that the whole story in the game takes place aboard an airplane (supposedly also a spaceship), and you are fully confined within it throughout the game. All the story elements come from interacting with the people within it (well, almost all), and so it is a good thing that, for the most part, they are well written and voice acted. And with a multitude of dialogue choices and possible story paths there is never a single clear choice to take, there are only the choices you want to make. That is what is most appealing about this game, and it is also what gives it replayability, despite being so heavily story focused. I am a bit disappointed with how it ended and so I won't be replaying it any time soon, only when the sequel comes out (hopefully).\n\nPerhaps the game I envisioned after a couple of hours of play could only have been achieved with a large budget, or perhaps we will get that game after all with multiple sequels of this one. Despite this, CONSORTIUM is worth buying and playing, you just need to be prepared for a fully story focused game and you'll enjoy yourself.\n\n7 / 10","December 26, 2014","true","4.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It would be more accurate to call this the first episode out of three than the first game out of three. The reason I say this is that there is one set of issues to be resolved in this first game in an overall arc.\n\nWhile to me it is a design choice, I feel that where they cut off this game from the next is probably in the wrong spot. Its like TV series that put cliffhangers in seasons when you have no idea if they will get approved for a second season. Instead they should have had it concluded with this arc all wrapped up and mostly just hinting at what comes in the next games.\n\nThe graphics and voice acting for this game are very hit or miss. If you know the original Deus Ex, you have the idea.\n\nComplaints aside, this was actually a pretty fun game. It allows for multiple resolutions to situations and creating circumstances that are affected by past choices. The dialogue is at times funny and the gameply entertaining.\n\nOverall, I would say at $20 it may be a bit steep, but still worth the price. If it is on sale then it is a definite buy in my opinion if you like games with little combat and mostly npc interaction.","February 16, 2014","true","6.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

There are dozens of pages of lore contextualizing every character in the plot, every event in the meta-narrative, and the vision of the future created for this game. This is exactly what people of a certain old school demographic in gaming claim to want in an RPG, but it is instead built upon a mediocre Half Life-esque shooter's skeleton.\n\nI say that, but there is more than one path to progress through the game in which the player doesn't need to engage in combat at all. In fact, Consortium places gunplay in the back seat, leaving the plot to be the driving force. The more active gameplay is, however, still in the car, unlike other "games" lauded for their plot but devoid of anything but the simplest interactivity. There is challenge to the combat, sometimes born of the situations, sometimes born of the tight spaces of the ship or the sheer number of enemies players are expected to deal with in one fight. There are also minigames, most notably a Missle Command-esque game that, while not difficult, is engaging enough. The point is, Consortium, while focused on story, does not shun gameplay, or even the fact that it is a game. There are even dialogue options for players who wish there to be no 4th Wall at all.\n\nAnd the subject of dialogue options brings me to the final point in this game's favour: The degree to which the player shapes the story. Consortium is near the level of Obsidian's Alpha Protocol in terms of the permutations each event can have, and each conversation, no matter how trivial, has at least two different potential statements a player can make. This helps immensely in helping the player engage with the rest of the cast, who are all distinct in personality, and for the most part well acted, even if some performances are clearly better than others.\n\nAs I said, Consortium is a big boy alternative to the walking simulator; games that use a focus on story as an excuse to be little more than a film with a few QTEs or childishly easy puzzles. It has RPG-level depth at FPS prices and is not ashamed to go into the absolute minutia about the world it seeks to build for future sequels. If those sequels stay true to this game while improving the more combat-oriented approaches, they would deserve consideration alongside the greats in the Science Fiction genre of video games.","March 12, 2014","true","4.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I was lucky enough to start playing once the final patch was released, so I experience little to no bugs. CONSORTIUM is based in the year 2042 or something like that.

I love this game, you can choose from so many paths that will ultimatly lead to one ending and one ending only. Although the ending dissapointed me, because I really don't like waiting for sequels and the way they ended CONSORTIUM leaves the player thinking about his choices that he had made, what he should go back change, and it also leaves the player craving more. Well, atleast it left me craving more. The developers said that the first public release about the next CONSORTIUM is going to be released very soon.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Oberain/recommended/264240/","Oberain","Oberain","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Oberain/","464 products in account","Tl;Dr -  A good game with a lot of potential with interesting writing and world building marred by poor combat.  Unfortunately felt like an incomplete experience that ended far too soon.\n\nConsortium is at heart an adventure/rpg tasking players with finding who the traitor is aboard an airsip and bringing them to justice.  The premise alone sounds interesting but the problem is unlike both RPGs and adventure games items in the game world are essentially just fodder to be recycled to provide power for your armor.  Despite a few times the game tryign to bring attention to certain items, at no point could they be picked up and examined making rifling through people's storage lockers and whatnot pretty pointless.  At no point did I feel like I was a detective trying to get to the bottom is a mystery but rather just going around having a casual chat with murder suspects with no actual ability to dig deeper and snoop around their personal belongings to try to contradict their stories.  As a matter of fact most snooping and gathering of information is taken from a newsfeed console that works like a text based "Her Story".  Keywords are used to search for documents and those can be read and new keywords attempted to piece together background and knowledge about characters in the world.\n\nWhile I liked this in Her Story I found it rather tedious in Consortium.  On the one hand, yeah it's nice to have an abundant amount of lore I can read through and learn from but on the other hand...the console isn't very well explained.  Half of the...articles?  Documents?  Whatever I'm supposed to call them are sometimes written as though they were intended to be actual posted texts and other times are written with action cues in them as if they were works of fiction or we were expected to imagine we were watching a video.  This confused tone gave the overall experience a bit of a amateurish vibe as if they weren't quite sure what they really wanted to do with with console research...so they did everything with it.  Also many documents you can search for are obviously meant to be top secret yet anyone and everyone can pull them up with relatively mundane search terms in terminals found in common areas.  I would of rather much of this information be put into the actual game world such as a paper in someone's locker or personal computer or find some notes that lead me to think they have a background in programming, search under someone's bed and find some other tidbit of information...you know...actually doing stuff with the game world.  Trying to pick up a book or examine something will simply destroy the item and recycle it's energy to power your armor as stated before which...is...mostly pointless.  It seems strange so many junk items are littered around the cramped spaces of the plane when the game has only two or maybe three combat encounters total.\n\nIt also doesn't help that when these sparse combat situations happen the FPS elements are clearly lacking.   The entire experience felt as if this game had come from a past generation where early full 3D FPSes were just stepping out of Wolfenstien 3D's primordial FPS ooze.  Gunplay lacks finesse with mindless enemies running at you guns blazing with no real use of cover or indication that the people you are fighting are real people (a story trope that is hammered in a few times) but rather mindless drones sent at you like so many Doom Imps from times of yore.  You are given essentially a lethal and non lethal method of dealing with enemies but without a system in place to aid in actual non lethal combat it becomes an excercise in tedium.  Instead of methodically taking down enemies trying not to alert the hive, you're stuck with a gun having to charge blasts that may or may not take down an enemy down with very little to no feedback as to what's working and why.  Once and enemy is downed you're expected to run over to them and knock them out completely before they manage to get back up lending even more tedium to an already horrible system.  While you are given a generous amount of time to get this done, it's still very likely you're going to have to charge into the middle of the battle to try to snag all the enemies at once before they get back up leaving the rest to keep shooting you.  It's an utterly unrewarding experiance they were better off scrapping from the game entirely.\n\nThankfully the combat is the least important part of the game as you spend most of your time wandering the plane and getting to know it's crew.  This is the meat of the gameplay and is actually done pretty well. You're expected to respond to people in a timely manner and just about everything you say is remembered and has some degree of impact later on giving a pretty good illusion of dealing with real people.  This attention to detail does come back to bite the game as you are often given a limited set of responces and have found on some occations the only sensible option was to stand there awkwardly and say nothing at all.  It's a shame the world itself wasn't given this degree of treatment as I think they could of crafted something rather special.  Each character's opinion of you is tracked seperately though I have yet to actually see this make any kind of major difference other than an indication of if they like you or not.  Only the officers in the ship seem to actually matter as you spend most of your time talking and consulting with them and some Consortium characters only appear for literally a single conversation (yet their approval is still tracked).  Replaying this game is pretty much mandatory as your first run will mostly be spent trying to figure out what the game wants from you and what you can actually do in the world to effect events going on; while this is all very well and good a full third of the game is tedious tutorial things that was interesting only the first time through yet were unskippable since.\n\nIn the end my lack of a recommendaiton came down to one thing;  The original demo for Deus Ex.  You see, throughout the entire game I kept mentally likening this to Deus Ex.  The RPG/FPS elements, the clunkiness of how just about everything works yet is not quite clunky enough to make me want to stop playing and, quite frankly, the very similar plot lines.  Deus Ex was one of my favorite games growing up and I remember being impressed by the size and length of it's demo...which was about as long as this entire game. Suffice to say I can't recommend a game that bills itself as a complete product when it's clearly geared to be an episodic release.  I have to admit the game started off on a bad foot with me when I booted it up, was immediatley told of the kickstarter for the "direct continuation".  So I just got this game and now you want funding for chapter two?  The entire plot of the game felt like it was leading to this long and epic storyline that never came.  The game just ended...on a cliffhanger no less.  A cliffhanger whose conclusion they now want me to go fund out of my pocket so I can go buy the second episode of this game.\n\nThis has a lot of potential and I could gladly overlook all of the negative aspects if I felt I was given a complete game.  Unfortunately by the time I first saw those credits roll, my reaction wasn't "Man that was awesome", it was "You have to be kidding me  All that buildup to the first actual mission in the game it wasn't even IN THE GAME."\n\nPerhaps if the plot was packaged differently and I didn't feel as though I was just railroaded into the next purchase I would be recommending this, but as it stands I just feel disappointed the game fell short of it's potential.","January 17","false","6.7"," 7 of 14 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","7","14","0","0"

If you enjoy the conversation part of games like Mass Effect but want it to be more meaningful you will love this game.  Unfortunately the combat is sparse, flat and buggy and the animations cartoonish.  The voice acting is decent which is huge since that’s most of the game.  On my first attempt I ended up in a shootout after a bunch of talking to NPCs, however there was a bug and the NPC bad guy was shooting before I even got close, so I started over.  On my second attempt I noticed that my changes in dialog really affected the direction of the story, unfortunately the story and dialog choices never interested me and I never felt engaged in my role, felt more like I was part of a Saturday morning cartoon world.  In addition the bugs and cartoony graphics really killed the immersion for me, which in a game where you spend most of the time talking to NPCs without immersion there is really no point.  I ended up getting bored and moved on to other games.\n\nConsortium is alright I guess to see how conversation trees leading to different paths should be done, and I hope all the devs and talent involved in that aspect catch on with other studiosn (cough...bioware...cough) and impart some of Consortiums success on to big budget games in RPGs when it comes to dialog.  But as a game in its own right nailing the conversation aspect of RPGs only gets you so far when every other aspect of the game is bland or broken.","August 3, 2014","false","2.3"," 19 of 38 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","19","38","0","0"

The pathway to pacifism is not obvious either: like Undertale it takes careful consideration of the motives and background of your antagonists. Unlike Undertale the lore of Consortium is deeply and richly detailed, with pages upon pages of news reports, intelligence analysis, character briefings, transcriptions, etc etc.\n\nImagine if Undertale grew up.

But during the last winter sale I've decided to give it a try. And the only thing I regret is not playing it earlier.\nIt may not be a game for everyone. There are games that are longer, prettier, even deeper. But what "Consortium" IS - it's a great role-playing game. Not in the sense of tweaking your character's characteristics, but rather of living another life, while remaining yourself (literally - you are playing as yourself, only after being implanted into a different body). You choose your own actions and behavior, line of actions - and face the consequences.  Act kindly, aggressively, funny, try to flirt or impose discipline - and see the crew of Zenlil-2 react. You can even choose to reveal your true identity. Or act neturally, learning of how this new world works and adapting to its rules.\nSecond part of the game is coming to KS soon - and I myself am waiting for a possibility to live in that world a bit more.","January 13","true","17.4"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/yoshikawa/recommended/264240/","yoshikawa","Venom Krulin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/yoshikawa/","424 products in account","Consortium is a sci-fi'ish game set in the near future (there's more to it than that, but that's the easiest way to classify it). You play as Bishop 6 quite literally. It's a meta sort of thing, though that's not spoilers.\n\nThe Good: I loved the plot and the character interaction. It reminded me a lot of Mass Effect 2 in that regard, but with more life to it because people aren't always in the exact same spots. The graphics are nothing special, but they do fit with the art style. I loved that every choice in this game seemed to matter (we'll have to wait until part 2 to see how much), but it was nice to see immediate consequences and not just a change in an arbitrary karma bar llike some games. Yes, I'm looking at you Mass Effect 2. Speaking of a sort of karma bar, there isn't one, at least not one visible to the player and I for one loved it for that. As long as it's done well having no number attached to your actions that the player can see makes it mroe immersive and stops the player from "counting karma". The choices make a difference and aren't just things referenced in one line of dialogue lateer and forgot. A lot of your choices determine who lives and who dies, a thing most games are afraid to do and save for the last minutes of a game.\n\nThe Bad: Glitches. There are quite a few, but there's nothing that can't be fixed fairly easily. Aside from the game crashing when you alt-tab, there's no crash related bugs I've encountered. I run two 660 ti's in sli so I fully expected crashed and other stupid stuff, but it never came to that. The framerate is a bit choppy and others have mentioned it as well. I don't know if that's because of sli or just some other weirdness. It wasn't ever bad enough to where I couldn't play the game. It's a bit on the short side for 19.99, but I think the replayability makes up for it. Going through the game again with vastly different choices should have a huge effect on the story and make your game completely different.\n\nThe Ugly; I don't really have anything for this section. There aren't any really bad bugs, at least nothing on the scale of bluescreening or anything that severe.\n\nIn summary I loved this game. It is a little weird, but if you like the idea of a plot driven game then this is it. By plot driven game I mean it's not like most games where they wait for you forever and ever. This game will go on without you to a certain extent, but not to the point of where you feel like you're being dragged behind a car. I would say right now, get it on the sale that is going (at the time of this review) if you think you might want to try it and then wait for a patch. Like I mentioned before the glitches aren't super bad, but they may irritate some people. The developers seem quick on the uptatke and seem to care about fixing the bugs however. :)","January 9, 2014","true","11.8"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","2"

The focus is directed entirely towards areas that most games don't get enough love in. Graphics are passable, and there are some minor glitches, but this game is all about the story. With a playtime of 3-5 hours and a multi-dimensional story line, replay value is through the roof. The short playtime also makes CONSORTIUM fairly easy to play in one sitting, which highlights another of its greatest strengths: the way you influence this world really is entirely based on the decisions you make. Each playthrough you are encouraged to adopt a new approach, and seeing the story all the way through in one sitting allows you to stick to the personality you have assumed. There are only a few instances where combat is required, and even then you can avoid lethal force. Or you can kill everyone, but be prepared for there to be consequences.\n\nIn summary:\n\nPROS\nExcellent voice acting\nSmooth writing\nReal impact from your decisions\nReplay value 11/10\n\nCONS\nBelow average graphics\nGlitchy, but improving with patches\nLots of looking around in your first playthrough, no guides online that i could find, wiki is incomplete","January 20","true","14.8"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

Although I consider it a hidden gem, there are definitely plenty of things that may put other people off. If you're looking for combat, look somewhere else. However, if you're looking for a short-ish experience with some decent atmosphere, characters and story, I'd say this is worth a look. I got the game for free as part of a free weekend, and I've seen it discounted as low as £2, so I would recommend getting it on sale, as the £6.99 asking price feels a little steep. Also bear in mind that if you're one for satisfying endings, this will most likely disappoint you. The ending is a cliffhanger, leaves lots of unanswered questions, and encourages you to buy the sequel; CONSORTIUM: THE TOWER (which is currently being crowdfunded (the devs have also stated that if it does not meet its target funding then the sequel will be put on hold indefinitely)) when it comes out.

Although I consider it a hidden gem, there are definitely plenty of things that may put other people off. If you're looking for combat, look somewhere else. However, if you're looking for a short-ish experience with some decent atmosphere, characters and story, I'd say this is worth a look. I got the game for free as part of a free weekend, and I've seen it discounted as low as £2, so I would recommend getting it on sale, as the £6.99 asking price feels a little steep. Also bear in mind that if you're one for satisfying endings, this will most likely disappoint you. The ending is a cliffhanger, leaves lots of unanswered questions, and encourages you to buy the sequel; CONSORTIUM: THE TOWER (which is currently being crowdfunded (the devs have also stated that if it does not meet its target funding then the sequel will be put on hold indefinitely)) when it comes out. At a discounted price, and especially if it's free, CONSORTIUM is well worth your time.\n\n","February 6","true","15.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

(Also note, there might be some slight spoilers in this 'review')\n\nMy name is Bishop so I figured I am higher in rank than the Pawns and equal to the Knights.\nThe Rooks are doctors and pilots and the Knight is the commander, so the titles make no sense in regards to power.\n\n\nI guess if who ever is closer to the king is higher in rank it would go  Bishop -> Knight -> Rook and then it could potentially makes sense, except when I identified with being the security guy (think Adam Jensen from DeusEx) because I found that that slot was vacant on the plane and then me being higher in rank than the Knight makes no sense since she orders me around.\n\nHonestly trying to figure this out took up most of my time playing the game, all I was listening for was references to what my role is. I expected to figure this out quickly so that the game could continue and I could first of all understand the questions in relation to who I am and then answer them as I would like my character to do.\n\nI actually never found out exactly what role I inhabit in the game and when choices come up I am left guessing, I thought 'Oh well if my character is the security guy or special ops or a soldier then I guess that he finds killing people to be a necessity, so I am going to go all out lethal'  and so I did that and what happened then is that I got shouted out by people that I thought were below me in rank.\n\nAnd all of this is certainly not helped by the utterly confusing titles where everyone calls each other by their rank and number "Rook 13" or "Pawn 44". The numbers have no relation to each other, Pawn 1 is on your plane but Pawn 2 is somewhere else out in the world. I guess the developers want us to know there is more to this organization than our plane, but it just adds so much to the confusion. Also, why do we even have a "Rook 13" to begin with? There are not 13 Rooks on a chess board. There are 4, or on one side only 2. There is only one King and one Queen in the game so why can you have an unlimited number of Rooks? The game does not even have to call this Rook "Rook 13" as there are only 3 Rooks on the plane and one of them insists you call him by his name, Wade, so the developers are already playing within the limitations. (Also as a side note there is only 1 bishop and 1 knight on the plane so that is also within the limit.)\n\nThere are some references to other characters which would take this above the limit but none of them are on the plane so it is easily solvable by adding the first letter of the name of the plane (for our crew Z as in Zenlil) as a prefix to their number. So for example "Bishop Z-2".\n\nNow if these two major issues were to be addressed then I am sure the rest of the game would be tremendous, although there was a situation very close to the end where I am asked if I have played the accompanying ARG game and when I answered no I got berated for it and there was no effort made to catch me up on what I had missed and even if they did it wouldn't have made any difference because the question was asked way too late in to the game.\n\nTechnically there is nothing wrong with the game, I found no bugs or game breaking issues other than that the game temporarily freezes up between (the admittedly very rare) loading screens. I played through it in one sitting, the voice acting wasn't bad and there is a good pace of breaking up all the talking with some varying action.\n\nUnless I find a reason to play through the game again and I learn a bunch more about who my character is then I don't think I would buy the sequel and as to whether or not this game is worth it, it's fairly short (which can be a good thing), it's mostly about talking and the ending is very abrupt. I personally, even if my review has focused on the bad things, think 15€ is worth it because I appreciate the game the developers have created even if it is flawed in some ways.","January 19","true","3.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The game is extreamly short, has few things explained to you and feels like a demmo for a diffrent game. I would be nicer about this seeing how it was made by an inde group and this could be something much larger then it looks plus this is an ongoing development, but the game ultometly has choices that appear to mean nothing. I understand what they were attempting to do because it worked for games like Wolf Among us and Left for Dead the issue is that they want to charge people 15$ for an incompleat game. All the choices evenchualy lead up to the same conclusion that you need to go to "the tower" and for the same reson. If the game didn't take me 3 hrs to beat the 1st time though or if the choices made me cair about the indivigual people in the story then maybe the game would have been worth 15$ but, you are paying for the first half (or maybe more) of a game that had a big selling point of "your choices matter" but they dont feel like they do and I could cair less if villen nomber one lives or dies or if the piolet lives or dies because at no point did any of them show mutch of who they where. Maybe they will relece "the Tower" (part 2) as a free addon to this game but until they show anything beside giving this part away for free for a day to get positive revews I must say don't spend money on this thing (not yet at least.)","January 24","false","3.3"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

You find yourself as a player transported into the body of someone in another dimension (yes just like Nomad Soul) who is kind of a heavy gunner type assassin for the crew of a high tech Bowing747. The idea for the game seems to have been to throw crises at the crew and allow the player in an interactive fiction type way to be an instrumental part of the crews survival, with a combination of free roaming, actions on the ship, dialogue and if the player wants to, combat.\n\nYour experience here is short without any completed story arcs, not that the game is long enough to do a good one. The poor writing starts when you are thrown into a world without any boot strapping to tell you anything about what is going on. I only became comfortable with the organisation I was working for and even knew what my character's role on the ship was after doing some reading outside of the game, after my first play through. The dialogue is poor, mainly because the characters lack real depth, the events in the game are pulled right from badly written 90's films (Under Siege 1992). Combat is clunky, when there is combat, and the combat simulator missions are unfinished and not, fun.\n\nThis game has so many bugs! And I played the 1.2 Master Edition which is a re-release, as the first version contained a lot of bugs. CONSORTIUM does not feel like a well tested or polished experience. This really needed more time in development. The component parts are here, but it hasn't been crafter or polished into a fine product.\n3/5","May 7, 2014","false","13.8"," 9 of 18 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","9","18","0","0"

If you enjoy the conversation part of games like Mass Effect but want it to be more meaningful you will love this game.  Unfortunately the combat is sparse, flat and buggy and the animations cartoonish.  The voice acting is decent which is huge since that’s most of the game.  On my first attempt I ended up in a shootout after a bunch of talking to NPCs, however there was a bug and the NPC bad guy was shooting before I even got close, so I started over.  On my second attempt I noticed that my changes in dialog really affected the direction of the story, unfortunately the story and dialog choices never interested me and I never felt engaged in my role, felt more like I was part of a Saturday morning cartoon world.  In addition the bugs and cartoony graphics really killed the immersion for me, which in a game where you spend most of the time talking to NPCs without immersion there is really no point.  I ended up getting bored and moved on to other games.\n\nConsortium is alright I guess to see how conversation trees leading to different paths should be done, and I hope all the devs and talent involved in that aspect catch on with other studiosn (cough...bioware...cough) and impart some of Consortiums success on to big budget games in RPGs when it comes to dialog.  But as a game in its own right nailing the conversation aspect of RPGs only gets you so far when every other aspect of the game is bland or broken.","August 3, 2014","false","2.3"," 19 of 38 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","19","38","0","0"

It throws you in the deep end plot-wise, but that is actually a plus for this game as you work out just what kind of situation in. Quickly into the plot, it develops into mysterious and, for once, actually believable mystery game. The one (or two, depending on your choices, I hear) proper shooting sequence has mechanics decent enough to make it enjoyable and I assume it's a taste test for the sequel, which will likely have more. Kudos to the developer for making the mystery cohesive and giving the player a truly stumping series of events. I only got it right because I noticed the culprit doing some dodgy acts before the investigation. The culprit was believable and I did not find myself irritated by any cliches. The plotline thankfully avoids many, many cliches. It is also brilliantly well acted, and the variance of accents really gives it a feeling of a futuristic, almost united world. The plot also reminds me of 1984, and gives the player perfect reason to support any of the factions (or neither, like me). I find most games flop when they try to write as intricate plot as this, either falling into cliche or simply being way too over its head to be coherent or well written. This game, however, does it well and gets a high reccomendation from me. A little short, but still well worth the investment. Can't wait for the sequel.\n\nBy the way, your choices change a lot. Unlike most games *cough cough* Telltale's Game of Thrones *cough cough*, every choice is significant and you also know when a significant decision must be made. You understand the severity of the events at all time and the game throughout is very intense. I'm so glad this game did its choices and consequences right.","January 18","true","4.6"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

I have managed to play 19 hours roughly, and damn they were intense. The story has enough twists and turns in the story with elements that may not contribute to the main story but give it context.\n\nExample: You talk to a crew member, and find out that they have a deep friendship with blah blah crew member. They then defend said member in a disagreement that splits the crew, this actually now makes sense.\n\nYou get a lot story context, with things like you are supposed to be a combat specialist, and due to this you can use the virtual training program. People are suprised when you don't know about weaponry and what country made equiptment. It makes sense. That is why I love this game. But it at the same time manages to break the fourth wall 3-5 times intentionally in a good meaningfully way, with a good amount of plot twists that make no sense else where, but due to the story delivery due make sense to the nth degree.

The pathway to pacifism is not obvious either: like Undertale it takes careful consideration of the motives and background of your antagonists. Unlike Undertale the lore of Consortium is deeply and richly detailed, with pages upon pages of news reports, intelligence analysis, character briefings, transcriptions, etc etc.\n\nImagine if Undertale grew up.

But during the last winter sale I've decided to give it a try. And the only thing I regret is not playing it earlier.\nIt may not be a game for everyone. There are games that are longer, prettier, even deeper. But what "Consortium" IS - it's a great role-playing game. Not in the sense of tweaking your character's characteristics, but rather of living another life, while remaining yourself (literally - you are playing as yourself, only after being implanted into a different body). You choose your own actions and behavior, line of actions - and face the consequences.  Act kindly, aggressively, funny, try to flirt or impose discipline - and see the crew of Zenlil-2 react. You can even choose to reveal your true identity. Or act neturally, learning of how this new world works and adapting to its rules.\nSecond part of the game is coming to KS soon - and I myself am waiting for a possibility to live in that world a bit more.","January 13","true","17.4"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/yoshikawa/recommended/264240/","yoshikawa","Venom Krulin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/yoshikawa/","424 products in account","Consortium is a sci-fi'ish game set in the near future (there's more to it than that, but that's the easiest way to classify it). You play as Bishop 6 quite literally. It's a meta sort of thing, though that's not spoilers.\n\nThe Good: I loved the plot and the character interaction. It reminded me a lot of Mass Effect 2 in that regard, but with more life to it because people aren't always in the exact same spots. The graphics are nothing special, but they do fit with the art style. I loved that every choice in this game seemed to matter (we'll have to wait until part 2 to see how much), but it was nice to see immediate consequences and not just a change in an arbitrary karma bar llike some games. Yes, I'm looking at you Mass Effect 2. Speaking of a sort of karma bar, there isn't one, at least not one visible to the player and I for one loved it for that. As long as it's done well having no number attached to your actions that the player can see makes it mroe immersive and stops the player from "counting karma". The choices make a difference and aren't just things referenced in one line of dialogue lateer and forgot. A lot of your choices determine who lives and who dies, a thing most games are afraid to do and save for the last minutes of a game.\n\nThe Bad: Glitches. There are quite a few, but there's nothing that can't be fixed fairly easily. Aside from the game crashing when you alt-tab, there's no crash related bugs I've encountered. I run two 660 ti's in sli so I fully expected crashed and other stupid stuff, but it never came to that. The framerate is a bit choppy and others have mentioned it as well. I don't know if that's because of sli or just some other weirdness. It wasn't ever bad enough to where I couldn't play the game. It's a bit on the short side for 19.99, but I think the replayability makes up for it. Going through the game again with vastly different choices should have a huge effect on the story and make your game completely different.\n\nThe Ugly; I don't really have anything for this section. There aren't any really bad bugs, at least nothing on the scale of bluescreening or anything that severe.\n\nIn summary I loved this game. It is a little weird, but if you like the idea of a plot driven game then this is it. By plot driven game I mean it's not like most games where they wait for you forever and ever. This game will go on without you to a certain extent, but not to the point of where you feel like you're being dragged behind a car. I would say right now, get it on the sale that is going (at the time of this review) if you think you might want to try it and then wait for a patch. Like I mentioned before the glitches aren't super bad, but they may irritate some people. The developers seem quick on the uptatke and seem to care about fixing the bugs however. :)","January 9, 2014","true","11.8"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","2"

True there are glithches but with so many options the game give you to solves a problem it is not a surprise. But if you can live with a few bugs it is still a good game. The story is great;\n\nYou play as you in the body of an officer named Bishop-6 a new and important crew member on ZENLIL a Consortium Command vessel. Your job is to get the crew out of trouble and they get into a lot.\n\nYou can talk to the crew members wou all have there own unique personalities, and I even uncovered a Hilarious star trek references in a few conversations I had. Love it.\n\nI love this game, it isn't perfect but for what it is I can't seem to put it down it is just briliant.\n\nUpdate!/Edit\nHave played the lastest version of Consortium and all the bugs reported when the game first came out have a vanished, and say again this game deserves more attention then it has gotten it is a really brilliant game and the hard work the Devs have put in to fix it up and keep us updated is wonderful.
