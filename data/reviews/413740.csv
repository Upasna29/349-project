I am happy to say it is faithful to the origional and is just as much fun to play. Thanks for following through on your promises guys!","December 18, 2015","true","0.3"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","14","16","0","0"

As one could assume, the handling of the miner on the PC as opposed to a mobile device yields a much more user-friendly, efficient method of gameplay.\n\n- Great ambient music\n- Beautifully rendered atmospheres\n- Enjoyable gameplay\n- Fun upgrades\n\nThis is a great game to either enjoy on the PC or the mobile device.","December 20, 2015","true","0.9"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","0"

The game just came out for steam so theres a few bugs but the developer will take no time to fix themn, im sure of it. 10/10!!!!","December 18, 2015","true","0.2"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

In this games case its a lack of content. Im not saying dont buy the game im just saying at this time i wouldnt recommend it. I wish they had a score system instead of a recommend or not recommend because the game is not bad at all, Its just that in most other 2d digging type games ive played theres more to discover. While this one has stuff it doesnt really feel like very much at all and youll spend most of your time just grinding and looking for materials to upgrade to the next pickaxe etc and beyond that theres not really much other than the occasional conversation between the miner and the other guy he works for. That should tell you how invested i became in the story because i dont even know the guys name lol. I just really feel there needs to be more of a sense of discovery and things to find and it would up the value of this game 10 fold. For me thats one of the enjoyable things about these kind of games the sense of exploration and discovery. I think what im touching on is the pacing of the game is too slow and needs to be upped some.\n\nWhile this might be a good game for some im getting kind of bored of it already. So i cant in good conscience recommend it at this time.","December 29, 2015","false","8.8"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

I played motherload back in the early 2000 and was hooked. 11/10 game on iOS. I certainly hope the Devs add more stuff like achievements.\n\nAs a side note for steam, I was extremely unpleased when I discovered I had to play the game first before I could write a review. Meh. Prevents spamming I guess.","December 18, 2015","true","1.6"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","6","9","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/EvilLost/recommended/413740/","EvilLost","EvilLost","http://steamcommunity.com/id/EvilLost/","626 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nA boring, tedious, poorly controlled copy of Spelunky.  Almost the entire game consists of either waiting for a block to break (due to excessive number of hits required) or just running back and forth to the surface (there is no quick travel and your backpack fills up FAST).\n\nPROS:\n-Basics are all there (upgrades, mining, "caves" with loots, etc)\n-Underground area seems to be pretty big (I went down to 1200 ft but nothing really happened)\n-The voiceover sounds great.\n\nCONS:\n-NO MAP. Seriously?\n-Extremely repetitive having to backtrack to the portal to get to the surface, especially considering how tiny your backpack is. You will be running back and forth *ALOT* (probably 1/3 to 1/2 of the gameplay is just this).\n-Very slow mining. It takes 14+ swings to destroy an iron ore patch (lowest ore) with the 2nd level pickaxe. FOURTEEN swings per block !!\n-Controls are awful (especially combat).\n-Character will fly sometimes when you jump but not other times (not a major issue as fuel is prevalent).\n-Plot makes no sense. Characters will mention things you've never heard of.\n-Nothing actually happens? You just grind ores to upgrade your gear and go further into the mines...thats it? There didn't seem to be any new mechanics introduced, there was basically 1 enemy type (its size just changes), and the tiny bit of plot there was made no sense...","February 22","false","1.3"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"
