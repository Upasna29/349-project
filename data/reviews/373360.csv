"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thecyberdruid/recommended/373360/","thecyberdruid","TheCyberDruid","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thecyberdruid/","4925 products in account","In a nutshell it's Ghosts 'n Goblins mixed with Mega Man. The price point is well chosen, so if you like 8/16 bit platform games you should really consider to give this one a try.\n\nThe game isn't easy, but it is fair and the levels aren't very innovative, but still well designed. The gameplay reminded me a lot of Ghosts 'n Goblins and I think that is intended. It's really more of a homage and not a ripoff and there are a lot of new features included to keep it interesting. First and foremost the inclusion of different armor types that grant you different abilities. While this isn't new at all, it certainly feels right when you mix it with a Ghosts 'n Goblins game.\n\nThe graphics are colourful and well made. At times they might feel a bit random, but overall they are fitting to the style of the levels. The music and sounds are good and also add to the atmosphere of the game.\n\nI'd like to leave a few words about the developer of the game as I think it does matter in this case. There was a problem with the game on launch day and the developer put a lot of effort into fixing it and releasing a patch just a few hours after the launch on Steam which fixed the problem. Afterwards I posted about a gameplay problem that I had and again the developer looked into it right away and offered a fix within a day. That plus the price of the game really show that there are indie developers out there that love making games and care for their customers. My sincere respect for that.\n\nIf you like retro games and/or challenging games you should really give this game a try.","July 20, 2015","true","3.2"," 28 of 28 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","28","28","0","0"

So even now that I'm stuck at world 2 I'm not frustrated since missing the jumps is my fault (the controls are simple and very responsive). I have ignored the story so far but I don't think I'm losing anything groundbreaking.\n\nThe only thing that really annoys me is the spawn pattern of a few monsters, for some reason they will spawn on top of your character or of other monsters turning it really difficult to react in time. Oh and the HUD covers a few parts of the scenario sometimes so if you don't pay attention you may fall into pits that are hidden by your status bar.\n\nBut if you can overcome those small flaws this game really is a lot of fun. Extra points for the nostalgia attack and the awesome armors and spells ;)","July 17, 2015","true","8.7"," 17 of 17 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","17","17","0","0"

You will die countless of times, even if you played Dark Souls blindfolded. Seriously it's hard, I'll warn you!

The developers did take note and quickly sorted out the games problems (which makes them awesome in my book).\n\nThe game seems to have been heavily inspired by the classic Ghost 'n' Goblins. It looks and plays just like the arcade game from way back when, but feels much more slick and modern.","July 17, 2015","true","0.2"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","9","9","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/camelfun/recommended/373360/","camelfun","Mango Mango","http://steamcommunity.com/id/camelfun/","842 products in account","Yeah, this is definitely one of those games that went un-noticed until recently. It's like Ghouls 'n Ghosts, and it's absolutely amazing! The soundtrack is really good, especially in the later levels. To fully appreciate the game, play it on Normal first, then go to Hard, then if you're brave enough, Retro.\n\nLike Ghouls 'n Ghosts, there are favorable weapons, then there are weapons you'd consider absolute trash. In the case of Cast of the Seven Godsends, the best weapon(s) have better hitboxes as well as higher damage. When I was routing a speedrun I came across this very useful information that just might help you out: No matter what weapon you have, a god power will make it infinitely better. The Mace's arc is so bad, but with the Wind Armor's help it has a nicer angle that can help defeat those shielded enemies.\n\nAll this to say, Caste of the Seven Godsend is incredibly diverse. There are so many different potential playstyles, whether you favor certain god armors over others, or certain weapons over others. It very much rewards the player can mash attack the quickest, so keep that in mind. Either way, the game's fantastic, and it's got soooo much spirit.","December 17, 2015","true","4.7"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","3"

This game fills a void long awaiting a game like this.  I'm speaking of the wonderful similarities between this game and the amazing old SNES version of Ghosts and Goblins.  This game definitely fills that void that has been aching for a game that is wonderful to play and yet, astoundingly difficult in its platforming nature.  It's a frenzy of button pushing and jumping like a maniac throughout this game and it's wonderful!  A definite MUST BUY if you have the seven dollars to spend!  Seven dollars, that's amazing if you ask me.  The game is of good length and as I said the difficulty is pretty damn good too.  The graphics and gameplay are top notch as well as the controls for keyboard OR gamepad.  Like I mentioned before, if you loved Ghosts and Goblins, you're going to LOVE this game!  It even borrows from the Ghosts and Goblins game staples like armor equips that get increasingly more amazing as you upgrade.  Weapon diversity that is pretty damn good as well!\n\nAudio/Video: 10\nGameplay: 10\nReplayability: 10\nEntertainment: 10\nGame Concept: 10\n\nYes, it is that great of a game!  Get it ASAP!

Even with the lame weapons (axe).\n\nThe magic feature of the Seven God/Dieties in-game is pretty cool and that power-up brought back flashbacks of Ghouls n Ghosts.\n\nIf you like old school difficult, but fair in it's execution. Check this out. If it's on sale, it's a must buy.\n\nMy only complaint is the lack of save feature; which is minor, but for many modern players, it's a major downside.\n\nI suppose another downside for those interested it the lack of Trading Cards.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/guil13st/recommended/373360/","guil13st","Moby The Duck","http://steamcommunity.com/id/guil13st/","997 products in account","This game is almost literally Ghosts 'n Goblins/Ghouls 'n Ghosts, down to the intro.\n\nWhile the art is nice, something feels wrong with it, like they added too much to make it look good, but it ends up being too busy, making everything blend together and may give you some problems playing. And for some reason whatshisface keeps rollerskating in the map screen.\n\nThe commands are responsive, but the character moviment and animation feels slow and heavy, maybe the devs are trying to emulate Arthur's moviment or maybe I'm too used to playing the actual Ghosts 'n Goblins, because whatshisface jumps are not high enough for most platforms. It doesnt helps that I get random slowdowns when there is\na light source on the screen.\n\nThe game only uses 2 buttons besides moviment, attack and jump, and for some reason the jump button is set as the cancel/quit button, making me quit the game twice before actually finding out what I was doing.\n\nYou use literally every weapon from Ghosts 'n Goblins, they only differ in appareance, and probably for fidelity, they kept that one weapon which the throw arc makes it fly just above the enemies, screwing over your aim.\n\nYou also can find magic armors just like on Ghosts 'n Goblins, although there are at least 6 of them. Instead of having one armor that boosts your current weapon, each armor comes with a preset weapon, so you have to know which armor has before equiping it.\nGetting the armors is also a bit weird, you break the orb (like the chest in GnG), a beach ball comes out of it, you hold your attack button until symbols start to flash above you and let it go once the icon you want is showing up.\n\nEnemies are a pain, the first level has TWO different enemies that are immune to frontal damage, one can only be hit while he is attacking (throwing a brick with infinite horizontal range) and the other only by hitting his back, but getting too close makes him turn around and hitting him only once also makes him turn around, and he only turns back if you get really far from him.\n\nBosses are another pain, the first one took me several tries because 90% of the time he would teleport to outside my range and the second one was almost impossible since I had the previously said arc weapon, his fireball attack had a ridiculously fast tell and it made a firefield where it hits, so you have to pull a tricky backwards jump, face him, shoot away and hope the weapon arc hits his head (the only place he takes damage, of course). Then he would jump to outside my view and spam fireballs from there, where I had no time to react because I couldnt see the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ fireballs.\n\nIn short, it tries to be a Ghosts 'n Goblins, but it doesnt plays as such. Not a bad game, but just makes you want to play Ghosts 'n Goblins. Maybe if you never played one, you will do far better than I did in this game.","December 12, 2015","true","11.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Because of its simple  Get rewarded if you don't fail loop. It also manage to keeps itself fresh until the end with varying enemies and challenges.

If you research a little history about their project, it has been several long years and a lot of work for a small group of people to put together.  They are also kind and willing to listen to feedback from the community.  I can say from personal experience in talking to many other developers- this is a rare and treasured quality that you cannot learn to be but simply - ARE.\n\nNow, as one more aside, I have bought copies of this game for several people and one of them is a developer of AAA titles who found the game to be way too hard haha-  but also a quality product with few issues.  He used to love Ghosts and Goblins and this was of course a great throwback.\n\nAbout the game:\n- This game is a niche title.  You must fill several pre-requisites to enjoy this game.  You must have time, patience and a high tolerance for repeating levels in almost its entirety.  You must also be a fan of the Ghost and Goblins series and their spin-offs.  The game adheres to many of the limitations of the characters before him- no throwing weapons at an angle but only up.  You also cannot double jump or drop down a platform.\n- You DO have a health bar of a sort that you build up through picking up protection(s) when you have a special armor.  Armor are easy to come by and once you learn their locations you can power up quite a bit to withstand monumental colossal screw-ups.\n\nI can understand some people's complaints about the game:\n\n- the difficulty: yes even on normal it is punishing.  But this is the style of the title.  It is supposed to be so.  However, in today's gaming market overflowing with companies who want to strike it rich in the new virtual gold rush, it is more of a negative than a positive.  I love the challenge personally, but I have come to realize that because many gamers are now older, esp. the retro crowd, they do not have the time available to dedicate to learning tough and complicated intricacies of any one particular game.  Jumping in and jumping out with a mild or moderate challenge is enough for most people.  The challenge needs to be tuned to this crowd first, with the choice available for the purist hard core challenge seeker.\n\nAlso following Ghosts and Goblins tradition, you cannot avoid sometimes picking up some of the WORST weapons for a situation at some of the WORST times.  And you may end up stuck with it for a long time in the duration of your run through- Just like GnG.\n\n\n- There are a lot of positives though.  The sound track is great.  I love video game music and the sound effects resound sharply throughout and the music captures the mood perfectly.  The weapons can be amazing- like the sword.  I have flown through many a level without any truoble because of default armor and a sword in hand.  It is just amazing.  Once you start holding onto your magic armor abilities of the seven classes of gods you can choose from, you will have fun discovering all the variations in their powers.  There are a lot of imaginative ideas balanaced with fair charge shots versus the power of each transformed bullet you throw.  The game has some interesting art- I love the style and it feels like I am running through a rotating painted scene inside an intricate fantasy story book.  The bosses are strict- meaning that you must adhere to their patterns that you have very little time to learn the first go around.  Again, you will die quickly even if you have a lot of hits to spare.\n\nLastly, the demon armor is hilariously OP.  Once you start not taking unecessary hits, you will earn this armor through multiple drops and then destroy the game in many places.  The game will reward tenacity and perfection with what will end up seeming like a breeze with OP gear.  But what you wont realize is, that getting there, you earned it with a lot of hard work.\n\n*One important detail!!!\n- There is an update coming eventually that will address a lot of concerns, new animations as well as some gameplay changes and item pickups.  I do not know about a save option yet, but this would be great.  I personally hope they allow for a level select feature!!!\n\nI recommend this game because I respect the developers, their passion for this title and it is a fun and challenging tribute to GnG.  Good luck.  If you ask, I may even buy you a copy :D","January 23","true","6.7"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","0"

Rarely have I been so immediately and thoroughly repulsed by a game. I can't even bear the thought of loading it up again, and so I sit here struggling to describe my loathing based on mere minutes of play. But I assure you, it won't be as much of a struggle as playing the thing was.\n\nCast of the Seven Godsends opens with your baby being stolen by some demon thing and stuck on some pulsating altar, and then you die maybe, except seven mutant people combine Captain Planet style to bring you back? It's not really important, despite your character having dialogues with all the bosses and at the end of every stage. You're trying to get to the end of each level, avoiding or murdering the bizarre cast of monsters that stand in your way. Your basic attack is throwing daggers, but pickups can change them to hammers, shuriken, maces, and so on. Collecting other powerups gives you familiars or lets you transform into one of the seven godsends, each with its own special attacks.\n\nIt's not a bad premise, but the presentation murders its potential in gruesome fashion. I don't even know where to start... everything about CotSG feels wrong. The graphics are strangely blurry (the only resolution options are 720p and 1080p), badly proportioned, densely packed, and clash everywhere. The city level in particular is a chromatic fever dream of pastel backgrounds, bold enemies, fog effects, and washed-out platforms. The enemies are stiffly animated and glide back and forth like a GameMaker demo reel. Hits lack impact, sounds are missing, contact with platforms is iffy at best, and so on. Honestly the game feels more like a ROM hack than a retail product.\n\nBy the end of my fifteen minutes I was starting to feel physically ill. I'm not making this up, some games just look and feel so wrong to me that I start to feel legitimately gross playing them. Even if you're not as sensitive as me, there's no reason to bother with this mess because levels get frustrating fast out of poor level and encounter design. The nicest thing I can say about it is that it feels a bit like one of those lost NES or Genesis games that no one heard of. But then I immediately regret bringing it to anyone's attention lest they attempt to play it, so maybe we're all better off forgetting about this one.","February 16","false","0.3"," 12 of 23 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","12","23","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fandango89/recommended/373360/","fandango89","Apparently Kid","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fandango89/","599 products in account","Was so excited for this. I figured it would be like a megaman type or any other platformer. Boy was I wrong. Apparently its a ghost and goblins rip off. Which basically means theres like 20 guys on screen shooting at you or homing in on you with traps all over, and if you get hit 2-3 times total you die. Theres like no health. You have set lives, and then continues, even though we're in 2015 and this isn't in an arcade, so you should get unliited lives. Theres no diagonal aiming, which once again, we're in 2015. It just feels frustraing for the sake of it. Guys respawn within 5 seconds of killing them, meaning theres always guys coming at you from all sides of the screen. regular guys have WAYY too much health. Instead of normal platformers, where guys take 1-3 hits, many commong guys take 8-10 hits, which hilariously is more health than you. Love games where common guys have more health than you. No joke, in one part, I killed an enemy, then then jumped past where he was, but he'd already respawned and hurt me. You pick up random things, but you have to destroy globes just to get them. Random weapons have different firing arcs, which can screw you in certain situations. The jumping and platforming are also kind of janky. Skipping text is also poorly done, leading you to instead of speaking up just skipping entire lines. It's cool how you can morph into different guys. There's aren't many checkpoints, and you accidentally destroy the checkpoint. I guess if you like constantly dying and redoing things with limited lives/continues and guys that take too long to kill, this is your game. If you were looking for a good platformer not ripping/mimcking off an old NES game, then skip this one.","October 25, 2015","false","7.3"," 8 of 17 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","8","17","0","3"

If you have some nostalgia for similar games it might scratch a certain itch for you.  The difficulty is steep, but a lot of it is down to overcoming silly things. For instance in one section the platforms were poorly synced, and I had to wait for several cycles for it to line up well enough to make a jump. Boss have decent artwork, but often there is unskippable dialog infront of each one, and you will read it... a lot. Although I would assume there is more than one weapon or even armor, I never got any. I stopped after the third boss, the weapon I had was some awkward to use mace that was more annoying than anything. Enemies had a real knack for finding my dead spot, which was right in front of me.\n\nThere are better games to spend your dimes on and I highly recommend looking to those titles first.","December 14, 2015","false","0.6"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

Perhaps it's supposed to be kinda tongue in cheek, which is fine, but I had one major trouble with the game, unfortunately. :(\n\nI mean this in the nicest way possible, but its graphics are hideous. And I say that with the mindset that games like Ghouls n' Ghosts have great graphics! The graphic style of CotSD feels somewhere between pixel and flash, and it's not consistently either. It feels very blurry and everything is kinda too small or scaled weirdly to really look 'right'. The difficulty also was really easy, I kinda just breezed through the first level without any real fuss at all, so it misses out on the "tough" style that Ghouls and Ghosts was so infamous for.\n\nFor the price it may be worth it for some, but I just couldn't get over the kinda shoddy graphics, which also includes some really, really poor animations. I know it takes a lot to make a game, and folks who are good at programming/coding will short change on the art, and vice versa, so for smaller indie type games it's understandable to give and take.. but it's really hard to overlook art style in a game like this one. I hate to give it a poor review on just "it looks kinda awful", but it's enough to make me not really wanna play this title, especially when combined with the copycat feel of the gameplay.","November 19, 2015","false","0.3"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","0"

And this game is the living proof of it !\n\nWhile animations are pretty nice (and I like the death of some enemies) just like the graphics (it's RPG maker graphic style, if you like that kind of stuff, especially the hero is a clone of some RPG maker character), while the powers (infinite until you get hit too many time) are superb and changing following your weapon and so are the attack animations... I can't give this game a thumbs up and I would discourrage anyone hoping to find a reasonable ghouls and ghost clone to buy it !\n\nSo why don't I advise this game? Let me say that hit box are not well defined and so are the platforms on which you seem to jump on or not randomly + the graphics make it sometimes hard to define what is a platform what is not which makes it really frustrating.\n\nThe game play of the character doesn't feel good, you can upgrade his jump and speed ability with some powerups you find here and there but it still make the character lousy to move around and jump.\n\nAnd probably the most annoying way this game plays: Enemies ! They are repoping so fast, you don't even have the time to make a jump to cross a platform or move forward ! And let me say that you will most oftenly die because of enemies spawning from out of nowhere that from the lack of your platorming skills.\n\nThe game is unforgiving but you will encounter a lot of "automatic ave" spots to restart from that point and that was a good idea seeing how the game is and how frustrating the fast enemies spawning is.... It will always prevent you from moving.\n\nAt the volcano level you will see boulders rolling towards you and that's okay but the platform they are on is not very well defined and they will fall right on your head when you think you're crouching on a safe spot... disapointing.\n\nThen there is the problem of speed... the game is simply overdoing it with speed ! It is way too fast and the platforms and other saws are going to frustrate you because you do not have the time to jump on them and when you do have the chance to jump on a moving platform you will probably get it by an enemy you killed 2 seconds ago (no really, it's spawning that fast, 2 seconds... maybe less !)\n\nThen there are the bosses... graphically very nice, they aren't much of a challenge... you might die a couple times against a boss but when you will defeat them, it will always be because you just mash buttons like crazy so they will die insanely fast without even casting most of their attack ! So it's either all or nothing with them, you will meet one casting spray of fire and fireballs really hard to avoid and you will keep dying until you start over and kill it crazy fast... you won't even understand why? Also, there are a lot of small bosses all over and they're all that way.\n\nYou still want to buy it because you think the powers look amazing? You're right ! But think twice !\nTo get a power you first need to get one of those big sphere, since you start naked, you will first get an armor (yeah!) and the animation of getting it is really nice, I give them that ! But to get the so called power which seem so cool, you need to wear the armor and find another one of those big sphere... Let me tell you, it's not happening that much at all ! You die really quickly and I do not have any issue with that, it's unforgiving and wants to play that way? Okay, I can accept that ! But holding the armor until you get another one of those sphere to get the power is insanely hard since the enemies spawn so fast and from every corner...\n\nI reached the ice level and the only time I got one of those power was twice, in the very first level and slightly later in the swamp... Each time I didn't keep them very long because of spawning enemies.\nCharging the power is okay but takes quite a long time and when enemies spawn so fast, you don't have the time to really charge it that much... And anyway, it's better to mash enemies and try to run forward than trying to charge your power to kill everything on screen... Same with bosses!\nAnd I get fed up of the game already because you don't have the time to jump on a platform that enemies are preventing you from moving but when the platform is slippery, you're sure to die after a couple try !\n\nAnyway, huge disapointment, it's nothing like ghouls' n' ghosts which played much better than this one !\n\nIf they ever change the speed of spawning enemies, the speed of moving platforms and make fights against bosses more ballanced and so more challenging, then the game might be worth it and a serious opponent to ghouls'n'ghosts.\nMeanwhile, do not buy it, go instead buy tiny barbarian which will give you a lot more fun and challenge because this one here isn't challenging or fun, they got everything wrong ! They tried to make it unforgivable by using stupid mechanics like crazy fast respawn of enemies, crazy fast traps and moving platforms and bosses which either gives you all (and won't possible to even touch) or nothing (and you won't understand what happened).\n\nSeems the game was developped too fast as well... Thumbs down ! Devs, I would like a patch which fix those issues !","July 21, 2015","false","1.6"," 4 of 16 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","4","16","0","1"
