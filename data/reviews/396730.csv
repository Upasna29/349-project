You then have to use your mouse to goto the top left corner and click the restart button, to reload the entire level. I tried mashing every button on my keyboard, but I could not find a keyboard command (like "R" in most flash games that do this.)\n\nThat being said, I really enjoy the main mechanic of this game. With a bit more polish, this could be a nice little gem.","September 25, 2015","false","1.7"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","8","9","0","0"

Its a 2.5d platformer, in which a character has to navigate a bunch of platforms, collecting 3 orbs on the way to escape on a final teleporting like platform. Puzzles / maps get progressively more difficult and interesting. The nice thing about this game is the rotation of the environment, and the way you do it. Its kind of counter intuitive, so you need to get used to it. But ultimately its a speed through the puzzle kind of thing.\n\nI've just completed the first 10 maps (i believe there are 99 in total) in a little over an hour, so far, and am really enjoying it. After finishing the first 10 maps, the atmosphere has changed from fields to mountains, there are also additional complexity and additional tools to navigate the maps.\n\nNeedless to say it screams for Achievements and a leaderboard so you can compete with your friend for the best times through each of the maps. Most of the navigation involves rotating, walking and jumping. Unlike the other review here, i see no significant lag, or problems with jumping or any of the game mechanics, nor can i see how its relavent, as much of the time its just rotation of the environment, and dropping / falling with a bit of jumping.\n\nSuggestions, achievements, and controller support as well. All in all nicely priced, original game, go buy it .. you wont be disapointed.","August 26, 2015","true","1.5"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","6","9","0","0"

Jumping is awkward and delayed. Graphics stink. Level design is bad and confusing. If you fall off, which you will constantly, must restart entire level, and not even easily. Need to use mouse to go to top left to click button. The switching ability sucks too. Not easy at all to use. You have to go to complete edge, then press down button. This means you will accidentally overrun and die. There is no grabbing of ledges for some reason. No controller support. For some reason you die if you flip and fall more than a small amount, even if there is something there to land on. Level design makes no sense. I got to end point but it wasn't activated, but had no idea why not. So I am left wandering around confusing level with no flow. Just don't play this.","October 25, 2015","false","0.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","4"
