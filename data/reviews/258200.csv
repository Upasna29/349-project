This game is no more than a glorified tutorial for the main game, and isn't even worth the price they set during the Steam Sale. Just get the main game - it's not particularly hard to learn, and is a far more complete and worthwhile experience, even if you don't get any of the DLC.","January 2, 2015","false","4.0"," 57 of 63 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","57","63","0","0"

Talisman Prologue is completely a solo single player experience, so you will strictly play against the Adventure Cards.  Nomad Games does take it a step further than that, and they have quests designed per character on the main menu.  They also have characters available that are not currently available in Talisman Digital Edition.\n\nJust know that once you complete the quest, the game ends, whether you made it to the crown or not.  The only quest in Talisman Prologue that allows you to go all the way to the Crown of Command is The Magical Quest.  Some characters only have The Magical Quest available to them with no other quest options.  There is a distinct difference in the two games.  Be sure you’re buying the game version that will suit your play style, unless you want both, then more power to you. Truthfully I think picking one or the other would be best, especially if you’re not sure whether you are going to like it or not.\n\nClick this link to read more!\nhttp://everydaygamers.com/2014/03/10/review-talisman-digital-edition/#more-29260","March 10, 2014","true","2.6"," 40 of 45 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","40","45","0","0"

Quests quite frankly aren't interesting. Often you need to get to some place or monster, and you roll dice one by one until you get exactly you need (Sometimes I spent more than 20-25 turns just only to be on the same space as my quest's task).

In a way, it's bizarre that this... thing, actually has a price, as it's effectively a demo for the full game. If you can't be arsed to make your way through the whole of this review, all you need to know is, this is a great way to make you realise how this game could be fun with friends, but not on your own, and not as it is.\n\nBeing older than I appear, and growing up in a time when Steam Sales would sound like magic beans rather than allowing me a way to convert pocket money into actual jollies, I would spend my time leafing through the back pages of White Dwarf, imagining what it would be like to be able to play the games contained within. One such was Talisman, and I spent a terrifying amount of time imagining what the fabled game would actually be like to play.\n\nNow I know. I'm really glad my 12 year old self got that gift for free.\n\nShould you pay for it? No. No. The game could potentially be fun with friends, and this version is fine for working out the mechanics of the actual game, which you are definitely not buying here. It's kind of astonishing they still charge you extra to buy the tutorial, although I have been informed it was originally released as a work in progress before the multiplayer was released. That still doesn't mean there is any point in paying for it now, and playing it alone seems desperately sad. I cannot imagine why anyone would benefit from playing this game rather than the main one.","October 23, 2015","false","2.1"," 21 of 26 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","21","26","0","3"

Consider this to be a tutorial to the extreme, enough to be able to sell it seperately.\n\nI consider it more of an occasional distraction, probably not one of those games that you feel like playing for hours on end...but one of those that you 'pull off of the shelf' here and there.\n\nAfter playing Talisman Digital Edition, I will say that I did miss the quests. Ultimately, it could be cool to blend the two and introduce individual quests into the Digital Edition.\n\nIt seems that, at the least, Prologue will either be a quick distraction, or it will be one of those that you will enjoy here and there. (Obviously there is the possibility that it may just 'click' and it is played to completion).\n\nIn other words, for the price ... not too bad.  I enjoyed it so far, but for me it is here and there.  It would seem hard to go wrong if you can get it in a bundle or, as currently under a couple bucks.

The Prologue doesn't add anything, it removes your oppnents and gives you crappy little missions like kill 5 enemies or get to the end.  Stuff you'd be doing anyway in the regular game but with the added challenge of playing against other people (or at least the AI).\n\nThe only tiny thing you get from this version is you get to play several characters that are DLC only.  but really you'd be better off just buying those characters for the regular game.  Or just not getting the game at all.\n\nI paid $0.69 for this and i'm still not sure it was worth the money.

I own many and play regularly with my friends in real life and online friends through VASSAL.\n\nI always wanted Talisman (and subsequently Relic) based on their generally favorable reviews and the description of the game. I like similar games of the genre and planned on buying it down the road.\n\nLuckily I got the prologue in a game bundle somewhere so I could finally try it.\n\nI can't really say it's a horrible game, but to me it's really not that fun. Sure, this is a single player-based version and in a digital format, but the core mechanics are just rather bland.\nReading the reviews on Steam before I got it I figured most of the negative feedback was based on people not well versed in boardgames and assumed they may just not have a taste for them. It truly is bland, however.\n\nThe biggest problem I think stems from the complete lack of choices, tactics, and strategies. It really is random. Not just in combat, like most tabletop games, but every aspect is controlled for you. The game essentially boils down to what direction you want to travel and making a choice on the off-chance you land on somewhere interactive.\n\nAll in all I know I will never buy the boardgame. If a friend had it I may just try it to see if it's any better in person and with friends, but we have so many better games to play I'm sure it would be a one time thing.

Well, except some, which task you with; get to the centre of the board. Most are just; buy a sword, kill something, go get healed. Quest complete.\n\nThere are some that are more interesting, like rescuing a princess and returning her to the castle... But the game doesn't go far enough with these tasks, nor is there enough of them.\n\nAlso starting from scratch each time you play means re-treading so much ground they're just not that much fun to play after the first time.\n\nThe gameplay loop is essentially; roll a dice, land on a square and do what it tells you to, usually draw some cards. The cards will have items, monsters or events... And that's it. There's not some opposing force acting against you, or for you to outwit, the cards are the only thing that affect the game.\n\nLevelling up your character is a fairly trivial affair; beat enemies that you take as trophies, if you have trophies whose corresponding trait adds up to 7 or more, you can exchange them for a level. Equipment cards can also increase your stats... Which means all too quickly you become the most powerful being on the board. Ultimately there just isn't really any difficulty to the game.\n\nThat's where the event cards come in so you can randomly be reduced down to something that the enemies actually have a chance at killing...\n\nThe funniest thing is that you can lose a turn... Which just means the turn counter increases by two. All I can gather is that the game rates you upon completion of the quest and I assume it just comes down to the amount of turns taken...\n\nI can see it being useful to learn the ruleset, and perhaps that's where the "prologue" part of the name comes from... But the mechanics aren't exactly difficult, or incredibly deep that they'd require such a primer.\n\nAnnoyingly there is another version of the game released that actually has multiplayer... Which begs the question; why this version still exists… They say it focuses on the single player experience... But really, there isn't much to that experience. In so much that I can't imagine why someone who opt for this one over the other.\n\nI did enjoy my first game enough, but then when I went to play a second, even playing as a different character, I was almost instantly bored.","February 27, 2015","false","3.2"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

Ah, memories!  I must admit to still being fascinated to see how this would all translate into a VIDEO GAME, however, so while this is merely the single player "prologue" to the multiplayer version (which has since been released), I must say I was quite impressed with how extraordinarily faithful the whole adaptation appears to be.\n\nI say "appears to be", as I've only played so much of it, but enough to confidently opine that apart from reducing the epic "get-to-the-middle-region-first-and-murder-the-♥♥♥♥-out-of-the-other-players-to-achieve-world-domination" mega-quest of the board game to a number of small, character-specific mini-missions, it's, well...it's pretty much the board game.  Or at least a limited version of it, as this particular game doesn't have anywhere near all the characters, expansions, etc etc...though to the best of my understanding, the fully-blown Talisman: Digital Edition does or at least will do over time, and assuming its objective is to be as slavishly faithful to the source material as this prologue game, I can't see that anyone looking for a video game adaptation of Talisman is liable to be disappointed.  As for me, personally, right at this moment in time...I might have to give such a prospect a miss for now, not least of all because of that friend I still have who's only half-a-suburb away who, unlike myself, is probably up for reliving our wild 'n' reckless glory days of rolling dice and shuffling cards at relatively short notice.  I'm a bit over it all, truth be told, and have more than adequately sated my sentimentality for the time being, so I think I'll ♥♥♥♥ away my time with other, less painfully overfamiliar games (be they of a digital or more tactile nature; I still play board games, just not this one when I can help it).\n\nBack to the Prologue for a moment, though.  This particular product would no doubt provide an adequate "training ground" for those too daunted to leap straight into the multiplayer game, though I can't imagine you'd get much replay value out of it beyond that.  Still, it's cheap enough, especially in a sale, and if you've never played a board game in any way, shape or form - or at least not one more complicated than Snakes 'N' Ladders or Trivial Pursuit - then this may give you an idea what dyed-in-the-wool nerds USED to do before video games progressed beyond one bunch of ugly pixels shooting at another bunch of ugly pixels with little dots or dashes for ammunition.\n\nVerdict: 7/10.","October 17, 2014","true","2.6"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","7","12","0","0"

It's MMO grinding except the quests don't actually give you anything of value except achievements. I find that very, very cheap of the devs and outright offensive, really. Instead of giving something of value they just deliver grindy content.\nThe value is for people who are really into the game, like me, who want to examine different strategies. I'm really good at the game as it is, having beaten everyone and their brother on my real life gameboard, but when I want to reassure myself I load up a random character class and spend an hour leveling it in this game until I can tapdance through victory. That gets old really fast, though, and there isn't much left for me to learn.\nThe Prologue is simply a very light story to introduce you to the grinding. It pretends that each character has a cool backstory.\n\nWould be more fun if it had more going on than achievements for playing it over and over.","July 23, 2014","false","2.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The tiny golden glow around the right-menu icons barely acts as a highlight and does nothing to attract the eye.\n\nThis certainly doesn't have any of the good design and eye-candy polish of other Games Workshop titles and looks to have been a cheap out-sourced project.

Then this came out, along with Talisman: Digital Edition, and I must say I reccomend them both, for different reasons. You see in Talisman: Digital Edition you get to play online or off and are up against up to 3 other human/AI players, it is fun and is a true original edition of Talisman(Or at least from what I read), but this one is different, you see in this one you play all by yourself, and you are on some kind of a adventure ranging from getting the crown of control in the magical quest, to something as simple as  finding a cave for the Troll(Harder then it sounds actually especially with the turn limit of 20) This has way more of a D&D feel to it then the normal version because of these quests, since your not just playing as a random character through one quest anymore,you can take a character through something of a small campaign of 6 total quests, and while you do not get to keep your items, or stats from game to game, it adds a certain level of interest and intrigue to these characters that the original lacks. Of course this is also a problem with this game too, you see apparently they decided to add some new characters in there, but then wasted some of their potential by not giving them their own campaigns and more or less just gave them the magical quest. (The one for the crown of control) These include the Vampire Hunter, Amazon, Minotaur, Leprechaun, Sprite, Sage etc. if you buy this you will know them, put this with the unfortunate circumstance that it does not appear that they will update, or give this a expansion to give these characters their own campaigns and it leads to a lot of wasted potential, in addition it would be great if they not only did this but came out with exapnsions for other characters as well, and put a nice campaign with them as well, (The Knight for instance). and while I will admit this is not Talisman proper, both this version and the Digital Edition has their places. This is for the fams that like the idea of different stories, and quests to do with the characters and don't mind going solo, where the other is for the fans of the game that really don't care about that. Overall a excellent game and well worth the purchase.\n\nGraphics: The board looks great, the artwork is nice, it is a step down on somethings from the digital edition, but the graphics are still good enough to please any fan, or anyone curious. 8/10\n\nControls: Simple to control and fast and responsive. 10/10\n\nValue: I set my price for games at about 2 bucks per hour of play time I get out of them. I have already got the full 6.99 plus out of this and I am not even close to completing (much less mastering) all the quests. So yeah well worth it. 10/10\n\nAchievements: What are those? LOL, no seriously though, other then cards I have not noticed any. Not that there is any scroe for this, but if your a achievement hog, this might not be the game for you.\n\nFun Factor: This of course will vary by person, or sometimes how long a particular quest takes(It can be brutal) but overall I give it a 8/10  It's not perfect, but it is fun and interesting.\n\nIn the end: If you are just a fan of Talisman the game and don't care so much for additional quests, maybe you would consider them mini campaigns/side quests, then this might not be the game for you.

This is a pretty darn good recreation of the basic vanilla Talisman boardgame with a few extra characters. I'm not sure if there are more end quests to unlock or not yet, having only played through once, but it's possible, given that the game's introductory screen asks players to choose a character and an end quest. I have only played the original Crown of Command one, because I don't see any choices for the end quest yet, but still... possibilities. Anyway, this is a single player only version of the game, and because it's faithful to the original, it includes turn loss cards and effects, which have no meaning in single player. Other than that and a couple oddities with the play itself that are evidently being ironed out by the devs, this is solid Talisman fun. Check out Talisman Digital Edition for the full game including expansions and multiplayer. And check this out if you want to spend an hour or two playing an old boardgame friend.","January 13, 2014","true","1.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It's a singleplayer "version" of Talisman, that existed pretty much to pay for development of the "full" multiplayer game: Talisman: Digital Edition.\n\nWhile that might seem cheap, it's actually beneficial. This version gives you lots of "Quests" to do, beyond simply finishing the game. One Quest may have you killing the ghosts of your former victims, another tasks you to take a certain character to a certain place, so it's perfect for a lazy half hour. Plus each Character has their own unique set of Quests, usually based around their various abilities. It's a really clever way of teaching their abilities in fact. Gameplay as Tutorial.\n\nA word of caution though. Seemingly no attempt has been made to "balance" the various Character's abilities, with some Characters clearly better than others. While this isn't a problem in singleplayer it could have been in multiplayer.\n\nCompleting every Quest to maximum 3 Gold awards was fun too, with some quests being genuinely very tricky indeed. It never got frustrating, but sadly there's no "Kudos" for completing every quest on every Character to maximum Rank. No unlocks, no Trophies or Achievements. No hidden artwork. Nothing. It would have been nice, but there it is.\n\nFor a fiver I got 27hrs of enjoyment out of it.

I've been playing the tabletop version of Talisman sinse the mid-80's and still play the current 4th edition rules on a regular basis with friends and family and as far as a solo experience with Talisman goes you can't beat this game. A lot of modern tabletop games offer solo playability but aside from a few clunky rules you can find online Talisman doesn't really lend itself to solo play. Until now that is. While Talisman:Prologue has been patched and newer characters have been added the core original characters each have several custom quests that loosely combine into a "campaign" and it's these missions which offer the most originality and variety in the game. So much so that if I ever did want to play my Tabletop version of the game solo I'd use one of those quests. But luckily this "video game" version exists so I don't have to pull out the box and go through all the hastle of setting it up and playing.\nWhile Talisman has fairly easy rules it can be a bit difficult for people who don't have a great deal of experience with these types of board games but Talisman:Prolouge includes an excellent tutorial mode that can be turned on and off at the players will. By playing the first series of quests for the various characters new players can get pretty comfortable with the rules fairly quickly. I'd reccoment this to any gamer looking for a nice, casual bord game experience. The only down side is the lack of any kind of save function. Since most games of T:P can be finished anywhere between 5 and 30 minutes this isn't too big a deal.","March 1, 2014","true","0.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I've never played the board game, Talisman, but this is a single-player adaptation of it.\n\nYou pick a class card with preset stats and special abilities that you use as you travel around collecting and fighting to get powerful enough to pass the barriers and reach the center of the board. For most of the classes, this adaptation tasks you with goals that are meant to teach you how to use their unique abilities and the general game mechanics. It's well-done and the mechanics are solid.\n\nThe actual board game or a full multiplayer implementation would probably be better and this feels more like a demo or proof of concept. There's just not that much to do and, after you very quickly pick up the simple mechanics, the rest is repetition. In order to fully complete a mission, you often need to complete the goal in a certain number of turns and, even if that were not often so frustratingly dependent upon random chance, it feels like going through the motions.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/arachin/recommended/258200/","arachin","Arachin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/arachin/","253 products in account","A digital clone of a popular boardgame, Talisman stands out from the rest because of the diversity of characters, encounters and play styles made available to you. Like any typical RPG you roam the world fighting monsters or finding treasure to increase your stats or survival chances. Ultimately your goal is to reach the centre of the board, but that'll require preparation, and in multiplayer matches, this race can turn brutal.\nTalisman: Prologue is a single-player variant of the game with specific quests for each character. The aim isn't to beat the other players, but to beat the clock. This eliminates a lot of the tension that drives the vanilla game, but the simplification makes progress faster and more personal.\nI'd recommend playing Prologue as a tutorial of sorts... and regardless they're both on the current humble bundle: Just $1. Why not?","January 22, 2015","true","2.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I disagree humbly with the negative reviews. The main game was daunting to me (a newbie). I got a new monitor and PC, and I installed both versions again, and love both games. There are many quests and replayablity in this one. It plays faster since it is solo. I commend the developers for making a solo game, even with the fallout from the hardcore gamers. It is not a cash grab- I got this with the Humble Bundle. Anyway, support the devs you like. Missed turns count against your time to get the 3 talisman level clear.\n\nGreat tutorial and neat quests. I now know the game board intimately. Highly addictive. Not sure why some people think the gameplay is like slot machine/random. There is thought involved when it comes to choosing where to land, what to purchase, powering up, etc. In fact, it's kinda like Pathfinder.

However, I would rather not play it alone. This is a board game meant to play with more than one person. It is a decent way to get into the game because you learn the basics. But, lasting value will come from multiple people playing the game. Consider getting Talisman: Digital Edition instead.","January 7","false","4.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'm only recommending this if you got it in a bundle. Get the full version if you're buying through steam as this one is single player only.","February 22","true","1.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

At the core of it, this is all about flipping a coin over and over and seeing what happens, but I found it strangely addictive. Would I have paid for this? No way... therefore I can not recommend it at anyway.","May 16","false","5.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I have this game on my android play store also.  It's one of the "must have" board games in your collection.  Nice and fast games if you're in a waiting room.  Challenging too!","May 23","true","20.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
