Unfortunately, while it is very pretty, and the surreal geometries make for an interesting play field, I can't recommend it on the strength of its gameplay.\n\nThere are basically thirty puzzles. Sixty, if you include the 'Nightmare' mode, which takes the original thirty and adds a second objective to each. There is a small variety of obstacles, some of which move (or adjust Bob the sleepwalker's path), some of which reset Bob's location or force the playfield to reset entirely. None of the puzzles are particularly difficult to solve. Most often, the difficulty comes from wrestling with the controls, or dealing with frustratingly fine timing in placing obstacles to manipulate Bob's path.\n\nWhile the presentation is surreally pretty, its impact wears off quickly and the game never really becomes interesting beyond that. It's exhausted its suite of optical illusions and bizarre tricks by the time you're through the first set of puzzles, making the second annoying for dealing with the controls, for little reward. It really feels like they ran out of ideas after the first fifteen, and added the rest as padding.\n\n...which is disappointing, because those first fifteen puzzles are fun to play with. It's the rest that drags it down.","September 11, 2014","false","1.2"," 81 of 87 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","81","87","0","0"

It is a very short game, with simple mechanics and a lack of depth… however, the small offering of gameplay it does have should be enjoyable enough for puzzle-game lovers.  Still, the game’s clear defining feature is the atmosphere, which is clearly inspired by Salvador Dali’s famous “Dream Sequence” in the 1945 movie Spellbound.\n\nThe main gameplay takes the form of puzzles in which you move your character from an isometric viewpoint to safely guide the sleepwalking NPC, Bob, to his bed.  The puzzle aspect of the game revolves around the methods you must use to manipulate the rules of the gameworld to alter Bob’s path without letting him die.  The puzzles are mostly easy; the NPC won’t die unless he collides with specific objects— in which case the level restarts.  Fortunately if he sleepwalks right off the edge of the platform, he will simply respawn at the start; so you can let him loop around while you figure out how to solve the level.\n\nOnce you beat the game you will unlock “Nightmare Mode,” which is more challenging, but still relatively simple.  The “Nightmare Mode” felt to me like what I would have personally preferred as the baseline difficulty.  It will actually make you think a bit, and is significantly more fun.\n\nThis “easiness” of the game only contributes to the fact that the game is very short.  There are only 30 levels, most of which can be solved in a minute or less.  In “Nightmare Mode” you will replay the same 30 levels, only you must hit several points on each map instead of just the end one.  This will take a little longer to play through.  Expect two to four hours if you play through both modes.  There is also an achievement for speed running the game in less than 45 minutes.\n\nAs I alluded to earlier, what makes the game stand out from other short and mediocre puzzler/platform-lite games is: the well-crafted, surreal atmosphere.  As the game is related to sleep, sleepwalking, and the “subconscious,” the art style and soundscape are purposefully very abstract and dreamlike.  The whole dreamlike ambiance in the game is undeniably a direct homage to Dali’s work and is definitely very well put together.\n\nBack to Bed is certainly an enjoyable affair, albeit a short one.  This game is great for any fan of the genre that might be looking for something casual and light that still offers a quaint experience.  It is the kind of game you can just zone into and beat in one sitting.  If you understand this and it sounds like something you would enjoy then I would posit it would be a pretty safe bet for you.\n\nFollow my curation page to see more of my recommendations!","July 7, 2015","true","3.4"," 46 of 49 people (94%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","94","46","49","2","2"

However, the surrealist style is unlike anything else out there and as a short but affordable puzzle game, Back to Bed is worth a look.Suffering from narcolepsy Bob’s stressful condition means he’s frequently sleepwalking in some bizarre and dangerous dreamscapes. Controlling Bob’s subconscious, dog-like helper, you must place Magritte apples and later, fish bridges, in Bob’s way and guide him back to his bed. Thwarting you are fish trains, aggressive dogs, holes in the ground and the evil morning alarm clock.The best strategy is usually to allow Bob to wander off into the void while you take the level in. If the chronic sleepwalker falls off the level then he just gets deposited back at the beginning without interrupting your flow. I found myself doing that anyway as the mixture of Dali, Escher and Magritte art styles provide some stunning backdrops to the puzzle action.Reminiscent of Echochrome, the impossible architecture and disquieting staring eyes that gaze upon Bob’s otherworldly walking are truly unique. The problem is that they mask the rather plain puzzle mechanics that Back to Bed uses and never really develops further than it could.With only two campaigns available the game is only a few hours long, quicker if you have the kind of brain needed for this type of puzzle mechanic, and although you unlock a Nightmare Mode after completion there’s not enough here to fully explore the mechanics possible. That said, it’s rewarding to get Bob back to safety in the normal mode and the difficulty ratchets up nicely as you progress adding the fish bridge mechanics and enemies that cause a reset of the level if they wake up Bob. Aside from the surrealist art-style mash up that amazes and unsettles you, Back to Bed also has a very weird sounding narrator explaining the simple mechanics occasionally. It’s close to being ridiculously silly but fits in perfectly with the style of the game and when playing you know you’re in the hands of someone with a unique style they wanted to convey.I feel a little caught in the middle with Back to Bed. It’s a very stylish looking game with a unique surrealist bent but the puzzle mechanics don’t feel developed enough to fully engage me yet. The payoff for finishing the game isn’t enough to make some of the levels worthwhile and it feels like Back to Bed is selling itself short by being constricted to just two campaigns.  That said, Back to Bed is reasonably priced and if you’re a fan of the art-style mentioned or want something a little different to play for a few hours then there’s value here.","April 28, 2015","true","78.5"," 27 of 27 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","27","27","0","0"

I know, I know - that's a lofty assertion! You can't just throw "best puzzler" claims around all willy-nilly, and I get that. I understand the terrible consequences to loose declarations. But trust me when I say this is fun, this is challenging, and there is nothing on the market right now in this quirky, surrealist style. "Back to Bed" is what happens when you let Dali, Escher, and Magritte develop a game.\n\nBob is a narcoleptic, and this stressful state has manifested into very bizarre, often dangerous dreamscapes. If left alone Bob will wander aimlessly until plummeting from the world into the endless void. He'll reappear unscathed but will continue this futile exercise until you help direct him to his... mind's bed? And what are you exactly? Well, you're Bob! Or you have Bob's face. With a blue cat body. Perhaps you're Bob's subconscious? It's all very strange. But suffice it to say you have to keep Bob safe. From plummeting. From fish trains. From vicious dogs and alarm clock men.\n\nIf you're anything like me you'll just let Bob plummet to his death for the first few minutes of any given level just to take it all in. Magritte apples litter each level. Melted Dali clocks drape Escher stairs. Tentacles writhe in the background while large, unblinking eyes watch from starry night skies and dreamy clouds. It's very stylish and mesmerizing. But eventually you'll have to get Bob to bed. This requires a fair deal of thinking. You'll manipulate apples to block and guide Bob's path. Later levels require you to create fish bridges to get across gaps. Aforementioned dogs, trains, clocks, and toothy manholes will need to be avoided. It's very rewarding to get Bob to safety.\n\nNow this is a short title. I wrapped up the main game in about an hour and forty minutes - and I am NO good at puzzles. I never found myself stuck for longer than five, ten minutes tops. There are two "campaigns," a rooftop themed world and a harbor one. But once you finish there is a nightmare mode of these two worlds that is much more challenging. The levels are the same but you'll now have to grab a floating key to unlock the bedroom door. This will be the mode that provides the most stimulating experience.\n\n"Back to Bed" is charming, weird, and fun. It's short but well worth six bucks for the ride. Puzzle fans and surreal aficionados rejoice.","August 6, 2014","true","2.2"," 60 of 85 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","60","85","0","7"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/recommended/308040/","mrninjasquirrel","MrNinjaSquirrel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/","1478 products in account","Sleepwalking is something I struggled with for most of the early years of my life. Not the (mostly) harmless sort where you pace around your room a bit or go to the bathroom in your sleep; the kind that saw me walking straight out the front of my house as if I was possessed, often waking up in fits with no idea how I’d gotten where I was. Bob might possibly have it even worse however, as the tedium of his job has caused him to fall into a deep sleep as his body takes over and attempts to guide him back to bed (oh hey, that’s the title of the game), no matter how precarious the objective becomes.\n\nBack to Bed doesn’t cast you as Bob though, instead placing you in control of his internal guardian Subob, who must frantically navigate the surreal world of Bob’s dreams in order to direct him into the safety of his waiting mattress. You do this by placing giant apples and, er, fish, to change Bob’s direction and protect him from anything that might disturb his slumber as he walks zombie-like through the eccentric puzzles of his dreams.\n\nAlthough the puzzle designs are perfectly solid, Back to Bed runs into the problem of ending itself far before its mechanics have any time to grow. After just fifty minutes I was already watching the credits, never having gotten to the point where the puzzles actually began to challenge or even really interest me. The actual framework of Back to Bed is excellent, but how it applies it is a lost opportunity. Even with how brief the game is, I found myself losing interest the longer I spent with it, as the puzzles are simply not engaging enough to be stimulating or satisfying to solve. The additional nightmare mode you unlock after completing the main levels remedies this slightly by adding a new challenge of having to collect a number of keys before you can unlock the door to your bed, but it provided but a small increase in challenge which wasn’t enough to make up for the fact I was playing through the exact same content again (it also only managed to double my playtime, which still felt far too short and insubstantial).\n\nWhat makes Back to Bed engaging despite the shortcomings of its puzzle designs is the wonderfully bizarre nature of its world, and the great atmosphere it creates. Aesthetically it blends the styles of Escher and Dali into a new, even more abstract look, with the impossible twisting and layering of its architecture adding a special flavor to how puzzles are laid out. The eerie dialog (which was recorded with the voice actor saying the lines backwards, and then played in reverse) might be the weirdest, most compelling aspect of the game, doing more than anything else to engross you in Bob’s dreamscapes.\n\nBack to bed is both a hard game to make a case for, and one which I wish I could completely recommend. It appeals both to my love of abstract art and puzzle games, but at the same time feels like an unfinished game. The ending comes far too quickly and provides little payoff for the tenuous puzzles than preceded it. There could have been something brilliant here had it not cut itself so short, but as it stands Back to Bed feels like being woken from a good dream too soon, leaving you feeling confused and annoyed as you attempt to hold onto something that is already beginning to fade from memory.\n\nFull disclosure: Back to Bed was reviewed using a copy of the game provided by the developer.","August 6, 2014","true","2.1"," 32 of 44 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","32","44","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/linibot/recommended/308040/","linibot","Lin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/linibot/","556 products in account","tl;dr: A too short puzzler with a striking visual theme that completely overshadows the conventional and mostly uninspired gameplay. Recommended with caveats.\n\n***\nThe most interesting thing about Back To Bed is clearly the art style. The game's aesthetics are firmly rooted in iconic imagery from classic surrealist paintings: René Magritte's bowler hats, fishes, trains, odd mirrors and the prominently featured green apple from "The Son of Man" meet Salvador Dali's floating "Eye" and the dripping clocks from "The Persistence of Memory". The structures you're walking on echo Chirico, but they're obviously mainly inspired by the perspective bending optical illusions of Escher's "Relativity" and his "Ascending and Descending" staircases. Even the little creature you control seems plucked straight out of a Hieronymus Bosch nightmare. The result is a bright, clean, colourful and charming comic style that actually represents its impressive bucket of inspirations brilliantly well.\n\nThe unfortunate thing is that these inspirations remain the backdrop and wrapping of the game, they never really leap onto the gameplay.\n\nI can count one or maybe, if I'm charitable, two puzzles that somewhat utilize odd perspectives and optical illusions; the rest of the game is a conventional, uninspired puzzler of rather low difficulty, with some real time elements. You are asked to escort the clockwise-only sleepwalking Bob back to bed, by placing apples as blocks and fishes as platforms, while avoiding leaps into the void, angry wolves and killer whale-trains. Despite the timing elements, the game rarely punishes you for failing (Bob mostly just respawns), and therefore there is no real sense of urgency - which will be a positive thing for some folks and a negative for others. There are 30 something levels to the game, some of which are very very short, and after finishing them (in about an hour) "nightmare mode" is unlocked: The same levels, with the extra objective of collecting a number of keys, an addition that forces you to rethink the level's pathfinding and makes the game more challenging. I may or may not revisit the game to finish the rest of these, but frankly, with no real new elements being introduced, game+ feels very much like it should have been the original game instead of an attempt to prolong its length, and therefore doesn't feel worth (re-)playing.\n\nThis disconnect between gameplay and graphics makes the game feel somewhat of a disappointment. It is a pity that the developers would choose to tackle such a unique theme, only to then ignore it completely when designing the actual gameplay. It makes the whole experience feel sadly shallow.\n\nThankfully the soundtrack and the minimal yet interesting and well placed audio cues from the creepy narrator ("The apple is a hat...") enhance the game's dream-like atmosphere and reinforce the feeling of floating within a surreal dream. Another plus is the general feeling of polish: Technically I encountered no problems and all the expected player conveniences are there, including pause and fast-forward buttons and the ability to mute the game's music and/or sound effects. However I would advise anyone to play with a controller; playing with a mouse feels unintuitive and fiddly.\n\nSo yes, I do recommend the game, with caveats. It is an interesting world to traverse, a beautiful art style to walk through and the smart sound design will allow you to transport yourself into a surrealist painting for the short time the game lasts. It is unfortunate that there are so few interesting things to do within that painting though, so maybe you'll wonna wait for a discount.","December 7, 2015","true","2.0"," 17 of 18 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","17","18","0","4"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/markdj/recommended/308040/","markdj","dj.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/markdj/","2973 products in account","Back To Bed tells the story of a sleepwalker named Bob and his ‘dreamdog Bob’ (it's some sort of dog’s model with the face of Bob). that has to guide him through his dreams. It's a puzzle game at heart inspired and influenced by games like Monument Valley, Echochrome and The Bridge, games that were in turn inspired by the Dutch artist M.C. Escher.\nThis means that the game allows you to walk on things like walls - things that aren’t physically possible for us humans (not without any help at least)  - and huge, watchful eyes and flying hats soaring through the air are very common in this game, too. In short; things that don’t make any sense, like most of our dreams. Welcome to Back To Bed. (edit: the review continues)\n\nThe goal is to bring Bob back to bed (hence the title) and to do this you have to help him by picking up and placing apples scattered across the environment. Every time Bob encounters an apple he will walk clockwise. There are only a limited amount of apples available in every level so sometimes you have to quickly move the apples around. In the later levels the levels are twisted in that famous M.C. Escher kind of way, making it deceivingly hard to navigate quickly. Moving objects and items like walking clocks and blowing steam pipes are also added to the mix later and as a result require that you both act and think fast in order to overcome the challenges presented to you.\n\nThere is a restart/retry button and in the beginning you’re wondering why it’s there. There are no disadvantages to dying/letting Bob fall off (i.e. unintentionally waking him up) until later in the game, where you can get hit by trains or fall down tiles and once that happens it’s an instant failure and you have to retry the level.\nThere’s a small bug whenever you fail by colliding with an object (which results in the Retry/Quit menu appearing). In order to navigate through the menu you obviously have to use your controller (or mouse) but if you use a controller (like me) it also still moves around your character. Nothing big or even game breaking but something I wanted to mention nevertheless.\nAnd another thing I’d like to mention is the fact it sometimes is hard to see the depth of a level. I’ve had multiple times where I thought Bob would walk properly on to the next part of a level except to see him fall off seconds later.\n\nThe graphics aren’t as colorful as stylish as the games I previously mentioned but it has a charm of its own. It all still looks nice, just not amazing. The changing background is a nice touch, and everything else is nicely animated as well, with all kinds of objects moving in the background.\nI do think the camera is zoomed in too far, because you have a much better overview when it’s entirely zoomed out. But it’s probably done this way to you a connection to the characters instead of just putting it high up there and letting it become ‘just another quirky puzzle’ game. It’s just too bad that these characters have no real depth and we know nothing about them, nor do we ever learn anything about them during our journey.\n\nAt first I thought the ‘narrator’ was just poorly chosen because the way he tells you about things (objectives, warnings) is done in a slow and unnatural manner, spoken with a deep voice. But the more I thought about it the more I changed that opinion (especially because later on it starts to twist everyday words). I still don’t think it’s the best voice out there, but they did manage to evoke a feeling of creepiness and something you could come up with in your dreams. The music itself is slow, as if time is slowing down. Combined together, they actually work very well.\n\nUnfortunately it’s a pretty short game and just when you think the game is starting to throw some tougher puzzles your way it abruptly ends after finishing only two worlds. Completing these two worlds will take you 90-120 minutes I think. After that you can try the Nightmare mode. Now, this mode doesn’t unlock any new puzzles (as far as I know, at least) but they ‘remix’ the levels by letting you first collect a key before you can get through the door towards Bob’s bed. It’s harder and obviously meant for the die hard puzzle fans out there (or those who just want to play more of it/can’t get enough of it) and  I think you can add another 1-2 hours to the total amount of playtime here. It’s not much, but still, more gameplay is always welcome I guess. Unless it’s a bad game. In that case, it’s never a good thing.\n\nBack To Bed is a cute experimental puzzle game that I’d like to see more of in the future. Change up the graphics a little bit to match the unique puzzle style and make the puzzles more like the ones we’re presented near the end of the game. And above all, make it bigger.\nIn the meantime this will do nicely. Very nicely in fact.\n\nSo, I think a nice PSA seems to be appropriate here:\nAttention to all M.C. Escher and puzzle lovers out there: Back To Bed might not the biggest game out there, but it is a game with a big heart and one that deserves your attention.\n\n[Rating: 74/100]","August 6, 2014","true","2.8"," 33 of 47 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","33","47","0","1"

You control a benevolent dream cat or dog creature that tries to guide Bob the sleepwalker to his bed within dream. Bob obeys three big rules: He continuously walks forward and turns right in front of obstacles. Letting him wake up loses the game.\n\nYou can influence his movement by blocking his way with big dream apples and let him walk over crevasses using bridges made of fish. These are the only tools you get. Also some monsters and environmental objects can and have to be affected by these tools. It's very nice that you can see where Bob is going by footsteps that appear in front of him, making it easy to see what's going to happen next.\n\nPuzzles are usually simple and easy and often have several solutions. They consist of two parts: get the apples and the fish and then use them to navigate Bob through the maze. Usually you have plenty of time to act, but at later levels you have to be fast as well. Still, the only times during the 30 levels of the game I got stuck were because of the non-Euclidean graphics tricking me into thinking I can't do something. I consider this a flaw because it was merely confusing and served only as deliberate confusion, a distraction from the puzzle.\n\nIt takes less than hour to complete the game for the first time and the subsequent speed-run achievement is not difficult to earn after you've completed the game once. After beating the game once it presents you with a more difficult "Nightmare mode". It adds to the basic levels several keys that Bob has to grab before the bedroom opens. These levels can be quirky but nevertheless not difficult.\n\nGraphics are quite nice except for the occasional confusion they induced as mentioned above. Music consists of hazy and forgettable tunes appropriate to the dreamworld. But the voice acting! I disliked the voices that sounded like a drunken person struggling to speak with throat noises. They probably mean to create atmosphere, but to me, they were mostly annoying in their derpiness.\n\nI should mention that I experienced problems running the game: my desktop powerhorse could not run it because of an unknown error, but I finally managed to play it on a laptop. I used mouse for the whole game despite it suggesting a controller. Mouse controls were fine but they did require a bit of getting used to. Basically, the dream cat walks towards the cursor when pressing left mouse button but then it could get stuck in the way to an obstacle - there's no pathfinding to work around this.\n\nThere is little to no story unless you consider the few cutscenes in the dreamworld a story. Basically, Bob (who apparently is a narcoleptic sleepwalker if that's a thing) falls asleep and needs to get to bed. So really the puzzles are the only thing to experience here. They can last you for three playthroughs, each one taking from 45 minutes to one hour. As it costs only 5 € I think it's worth it if you like puzzle games. Remember though it's only a short experience and there's basically no replay value afterwards. If you're merely intrigued, get it on sale.","February 1, 2015","true","3.3"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","13","16","0","0"

This game involves a sleep walker named Bob that has a penchant for strolling off roofs along his dream guide Subob. The player must control the mutt and lead Bob safely back to bed by the use of strategically placed apples.\n\nThe biggest selling point of this game would be its presentation, a surrealistic dream world with a cartoonish ring attached. The art did a good job in setting the atmosphere, it was unique and refreshing from the usual fair. A shame that the graphics had nothing to write home about, but they are certainly a step up from what you’d expect from a flash game. Similar things can be said about the music as well, since it was just ambient and quite most of the time.\n\nThe puzzles were mildly taxing with a good difficulty curve, I had little trouble during my play through of the 30 stages. Nightmare mode was understandably harder, but still a relatively simple ride if you’re not a stranger to this genre. With unlimited tries and no penalties, it took me around 5 hours to complete this in earnest.\n\nWith the reasonably cheap price tag, I would recommend this as a short distraction, though you’ll do much better if you buy this during a sale.","May 16","true","5.8"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","2"

It is oozing with Dali influences (melting clocks, etc) and is easily the highlight of this game.  I also felt some Twin Peaks influence, especially in the voice work.\n\nThe premise is simple. Bob is a sleepwalker and you have to prevent him from falling while he is somnambulatory using a little human/dog hybrid looking thing with the goal of each stage to get him...back to bed. It's very easy to get the gist of and the puzzles start getting more and more challenging as one would expect.\n\nIf you enjoy puzzlers and this art style, at its current price point (approx $5.09), I'd say its a worthwhile pickup. But its not something I can suggest you jump on immediately unless you fancy this sort of game and are in need of a new puzzler.\n\nIt's plain to see the developer put a lot of heart and soul into making this game and it's teeming with wonderful artistic references.

The art style is strong, emulates classic surrealism like Dali, Magritte and Escher, and fits the mood perfectly. The game is very good at introducing new puzzle element at a decent pace. The puzzles never get too tediuous, and the mechanics work with it's style.\nBut with all this, I can't say I very much like this game. It's not very hard. There are only 30 levels, plus 30 extra levels of "Nightmare Mode", which are variations. Most of the levels usually consist of going and fetching objects which are out of the way, then placing them in some proper spot, which isn't very enticing puzzle design. It's not necessarily bad, but it didn't grab me. I felt as though not enough of them engaged other puzzle solving techniques. I can't recall many distinct or gratifying levels in the game. Maybe it's because none of these levels feel really inspired. In fact, very little in Back to Bed feels inspired. I guess that's the real issue I have with this game.

Escher-esque levels.  I features strangely distorted voice work while you run around as a small creature, moving apples around to block the sleepwalker's path.  Sufficed to say, it's weird.\n\nPuzzles are pretty straightforward and thankfully allow the use of a fast forward function to speed up the rather slow moving sleepwalker.  Some levels include moderately mind-bending parts utilizing the twisted dimensions of the Escher-esque style, though nowhere near as complex as The Bridge.  It takes a bit of strategy and a bit of speed and reflexes to complete the levels, but nothing that's unreasonably difficult.  I did find myself needing to make quick adjustments to complete a few levels which some people may not like.\n\nThe only disappointment with this game is its length.  The game contains 30 levels and has a speedrun achievement to complete them all in less than 45 minutes.  I completed it on my first try, though I tend to be pretty quick and made frequent use of the fast forward function.  There is also an unlockable nightmare mode after you finish all the levels which requires you to maneuver the sleepwalker to pick up several keys before completing each level to add a bit more challenge.  It never really gets difficult however, and I feel like the game was just getting started when it ended.  I would like to see the game expanded, or a sequel with more and more difficult puzzles.\n\nOther than the disappointing length, it's a very good game.

The sleeper, Bob, sleepwalks around levels and turns right whenever he encounters an object. To get him back to bed, you have to rearrange apples and fish, keep him away from alarm clocks and dogs, and remember that dream levels work like M.C. Esher paintings. Seriously, level 2-14, don't forget.\n\nThis game looks really good, honestly. They nailed the aesthetic they were going for, with weird dreamscapes out of a Dali painting and cartoony characters. There's a cool voice-over that talks like a backwards recording and some really neat setpieces like the whale locomotive. The puzzles ramp up in difficulty pretty evenly (as long as you remember the Esher thing!) and do a good job of introducing new mechanics. It's solid and pretty and clever, which makes me sad that it's so short. For some reason, the main game is split into two chapters of 15 puzzles each, 30 total. The first few are tutorial-style levels to teach new mechanics, and the gradual ramp-up in challenge means only the last 3-4 puzzles of either chapter are actually hard. There are Nightmare versions of both chapters you unlock by beating the normal ones, but those are just the same levels with extra keys you have to direct Bob to pick up. So technically there are 60 puzzles, but half are hard mode repeats. I beat all 30 normal levels and the first 7 Nightmare levels in a little over an hour, so yeah, it's pretty short.

Which to be fair looks like something Pablo Picasso envisioned while on drugs and having night terrors. contd-below\nhttp://youtu.be/-JAz20Zm65E\n\nThe art style is unique and appealing, lending it extremely well to the games rather bizarre mind bending puzzles and reality. The same applies to the player’s character; Subob. Which looks like a rabbit-dog with tentacle limbs, and a human’s face.\nDotted throughout Bob’s subconscious are ever watching eyes, a rather bizarre and strange twist, almost as if Bob can sense people in the outside world watching him as he randomly falls asleep.\nMaking things even more strange and bizarre, are the randomly dotted tentacles, which I have not been able to figure out yet. Add in the rather strange and downright weird announcer voice, which for all I know could be a sick Xenobite that has actually trapped poor Bob in a sick realm for pleasure; and things constantly feel out of place and uncomfortable.\n\nThis bizarre and somewhat twisted setting is what helps to make Back to Bed such a unique, and rather enjoyable puzzle game. I can’t say I’ve ever been fond of these types of games, but I kept playing without realising.\n\nThe puzzles start out extremely easy, with the announcer usually giving you a singular hint. “Apples are hats”, or “Watch out for the clock”. They might sound odd, and the voice certainly is; but they’re all you need to figure out what to do.\n\nBob can only turn clock-wise, a form of OCD accompanying his narcolepsy, which is the basis of the puzzle game. You have to try and manoeuvre him back to the safety of his dream bed. To do this you guide him, obstruct his path to prevent him from falling into the abyss, and by turning his direction by making him bump into apples.\nThis all needs to be done without waking the poor fellow, as he might just have a mental break judging by his bizarre subconscious.\nHere and there are strange stairs that allow Subob to move onto walls, change dimensional directions, and jump platforms. All for the sake of finding over sized apples, and fish with which to help poor Bob. Portals also play a role, taking the form of mirrors with quicksilver. Some are used simply to  acquire some apples, while others are a vital part of the maze through which you need to guide Bob.\n\nThe game’s art style, music, and puzzles all blend together to form an extremely enjoyable experience. Even for someone like myself that has never truly enjoyed puzzles games.\nYou’ll easily find yourself spending a few minutes here and there playing Back to Bed; or even lose a few hours without realising it.\n\nBedtime Digital Games really have a great game here, and it’s a must buy for puzzle fans, let alone someone that wants to give a unique Indie game a try.","August 6, 2014","true","0.7"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"

Set in a 3D, isometric, cartoonishly-creepy M.C. Escher-styled world of checkerboard platforms and stairwells. You run around placing objects and bridges to coerce and allow Bob the sleep-walker to navigate his way through hazards and drops safely back to his bed. There's 30 levels of increasing complexity and mechanics.\n\n"Nightmare mode" takes you through the same levels with the added requirement of navigating Bob to pick up awkwardly-placed keys along the way to unlock the door to his bedroom in each level. Playing this mode felt more like the puzzling challenge the game should be from the get go, but it's only unlocked once beating the game the first time (an unfortunate design decision in many such games).\n\nIt's a fun couple hours of chin-scratching, so it's worth the play for a puzzle-y diversion, but as with many of these small puzzle games, it could have squeezed a lot more out of its potential by including more levels, and taking advantage of its under-used mechanics in more unique ways (such as introducing the player-character's ability to trasfer to different planes of gravity into Bob's own repertoire).\n\nIt recommends a controller, but I had no problem playing the whole thing one-handed with a two-button mouse.","April 28, 2015","true","2.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/himmatsj/recommended/308040/","himmatsj","himmatsj","http://steamcommunity.com/id/himmatsj/","138 products in account","The one thing that really led me to buying Back to Bed was Monument Valley, a truly superb mobile game. More specifically, it was the similarity in art styles. Let just say, while the art is nominally similar, both have got very different gameplay and Back to Bed does not make as much use of the twisted dimension as Monument Valley does. So if you buy this game just based on that accord, you will most probably regret your purchase. Back to Bed doesn't come anywhere close to Monument Valley in art, sound nor gameplay.\n\nNow, to reviewing this game in its own right. The biggest downside for me is the absolutely terrible, and frustrating keyboard controls. I know the devs clearly state a controller is recommended, but I did not expect the controls to be this bad. For instance, the fast forward feature has no keyboard shortcut at all. And it is so easy to get stuck at stairs that allow you to go on 90-degree walls. You can't edit the controls, and the tutorial only explains in terms of controller controls. The game is still playable, but rather frustrating.\n\nThe art style is somewhat haunting. I do like it and appreciate the many dreamlike features it has. However, the art is still very limited. It is not fully explored. Also, the gameplay does not make much use of the various mind bending dimensions to good effect. There are some puzzles that use it, but far and few between. I do not like the voice acting that sounds like a drunk guy slurring, and the soundtrack was negligible in the fact I barely even noticed it.\n\nAnother thing is the entire presentation of the game, with the huge iconed in game UI, clearly speaks of a lazy mobile port.\n\nI am not the biggest fan of puzzle games, so I cannot comment on the difficulty much. Some say they completed the game in under an hour, but I am not finding it that easy. The good thing is this isn't supremely difficult, so if you're a casual puzzle gamer, you might like it. There are thrifty normal levels, then thirty more harder nightmare levels.\n\nAll in all, I would say I am disappointed with the game. It personally doesn't feel as great or beautiful to play as Monument Valley, the primary driving force of me buying it. Then the poor keyboard controls support, limited graphics and sound, mobile UI and mechanics that are not fully explored in this haunting escheresque design style means that I find it to be like any other basic puzzle game. It's not completely bad, so depending on what you expect out of it, you should make your own decision to buy or not. A good thing is the price seems ok for me.","August 7, 2014","false","5.4"," 20 of 55 people (36%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","36","20","55","0","0"

The game doesn't try to step beyond the boundaries of what it can accomplish as a little indie game...which is to the game's benefit, since less is typically more when it comes to puzzles.

There's a significant level of polish here for a freshman title, however the 30 levels lack the depth of other mature puzzle platforming games. Once the player has learned the basic verbs for solving these challenges, the rest of the game can be completed in a breeze and the Nightmare Mode doesn’t offer enough variety to keep hardcore puzzle solvers interested.\n\nHowever, while Back to Bed may be a slumber start for Bedtime Digital Games, it shows some promise and a high understanding of its theme that provides a pleasant and relaxing interlude between the far more difficult and obtuse puzzle games from the indie scene.

It is only an hour long and a clear mobile port. There is no real story, and the only voice is the narrator which sounds like he has a speech impediment. You are some random dog thing that places apples and fish to block a continuously walking guy so he gets to his bed. That is the entire game. You do the same thing every single level, and it gets super boring and repetitive quickly.\n\nThe only draw of this game is the MC Escher vibe of the levels, but even that is just a clear gimmick that isn't implemented well. The guy's path never takes him walking up walls or weird stairs or any of that. The only time you do is from walking up stairs onto walls to pick up an apple, a cheap way that doesn't affect gameplay but that they can show pictures to make it seem like it matters. This game is all about puzzle solving. The problem is sometimes the level design and environment make it so you can't solve the puzzle yourself. Multiple times I couldn't find a solution, because a platform that looked to be two tiles over and way above it, was actually on par with a tile 2 to the side, and I could place a fish across, but I had no way of knowing because it doesn't look that way. There are other cheap tricks, such as knowin what will happen with a chess piece. Also, the game doesn't tell you that the guy can fall off and you won't have to restart the level, something that you NEED to know to beat some levels. So for a puzzle game to expect you to beat puzzles when they don't give you the tools or knowledge to do so it stupid. There are 30 levels, and 30 levels of "nightmare mode" which is just the same levels but with some collection, a cheap way to pretend to have the game longer. Avoid this at all costs and just look at the pictures.","August 29, 2015","false","3.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game has good mechanics that work well and the confusing multi planed world can make for interesting puzzle solving, the problem is there isn't enough levels to justify the standard price tag. For a game that will take you about two hours to beat in total I'd recommend waiting for it to go on sale for under $2.49 USD. It's fun, the problem is that there are more games available with just as good content a better hour/enjoyment per hour than this one.\n\nIf the game is on sale grab it and you won't regret it, but at full price I would wait. It's a fun puzzle game with good execution and I can say I enjoyed the game.","October 22, 2015","true","3.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It has no story which makes it simply much too short for a game. The game is well polished, but the puzzle elements have been done 100x before, and better, with nothing new to add other then a little spit and polish. Also, I found the narrator's voice plain creepy. Yes it's supposed to sound reversed and weird as it's the dream world, but it didn't captivate me in a cute way indie games normally grab me. It felt unnerving.\n\nAlso, what I found really bad was item selection. When an apple was next to a fish, no matter which direction I was facing I always seemed to pick up the apple. The game isn't that difficult, so it's easy to find away around this. Still, it was an annoyance.\n\nWhen it's available for 50 cents, and you love simple but logical puzzle go for it. For everyone else, I can't recommend this tiny  55 minute game. 5/10.","January 6","false","3.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The build-up in complexity is gradual and thought out. Some small things you have to discover by trail and error, but no unreasonable hard solutions. The levels get quite challenging and didn't frustrate me. It was always my own fault when failing. No glitches or hickups experienced. Beautiful artwork and an overall surreal atmosphere. It a bit short (30 levels, which all can be playing in normal or 'nightmare'-mode) in general, however considering the low price-tag, completely worth your money.","June 25, 2015","true","3.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is also extremely short and mechanically simple, so you shouldn't expect a whole lot out of it. The Nightmare levels that are unlocked after beating the main game are copies of the original levels but add a new mechanic that forces the player to take paths and risks that might not have been considered otherwise, making what could have been a simple change in difficulty into something worth playing immediately after beating the game. All in all it's a simple, relatively easy puzzle game with an interesting aesthetic. It does what it tries to do well, even if that's nothing new or special. It's worth what little time it takes to play, as long as you can justify spending money for something that isn't going to last much longer than 2 to 4 hours.","December 31, 2015","true","5.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
