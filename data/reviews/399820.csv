Single player and local multiplayer with controller and keyboard support are implemented, and generally work well.  XBox 360/XBox One controllers should work out of the box.  Other controllers should work through X360CE, and oddly enough, my DualShock 2 through a USB adaptor worked, though I did have to remap the buttons.\n\nThe downside is that there is no network multiplayer support - only local multiplayer support.  The developers have stated that they're working on adding the support before the game exits early access, and I hope that they do because this game is seriously fun.\n\nI wouldn't suggest buying this game for full price right now, at least until it exits early access.  Pick it up while it's on sale and have a grand old time re-living working through Nintendo World Cup at the age of 8!","April 10","true","3.7"," 25 of 26 people (96%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","96","25","26","2","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ultanium/recommended/399820/","ultanium","Ult","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ultanium/","409 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThis is the product of what would happen if the fast-paced and thunderbolt world of Super Mario Strikers met the charming and intense world of Sensible Soccer. Sprinkle some unforgettable scenes from Shaolin Soccer and you have Kopanito All-Stars Soccer.\n\nImpressions\n+ I have never had so much fun slide tackling in to opponents. Traditional grassroot rules do not apply, so get out there and break those legs!\n+ Gameplay is solid and fully responsive between keyboard and gamepad. There is a learning curve involved, but once you discover the importance of team work, dribbling and tackling, everything feels a lot friendlier.\n+ Visually a very charming game. The cartoony art direction is certainly a good call and works well. Player animations are solid. Goal celebrations are... ahem... animated.\n+ Not a lot to offer in terms of sound effects and soundtrack, but the current offering delivers to a satisfactory standard.\n+ A large assortment of competitions to unlock and play through including custom tournaments, practice and friendly matches.\n+ Powers can be huge game changers and injects new life to the sport. There are four powers in total with individual strengths and weaknesses.\n+ Support for up to four additional local players. Grab your friend(s) and charge through various tournaments as a team.\n+ Full keyboard + mouse and gamepad support. Keys can be configured to your heart’s content.\n+ The greater the goal difference, the more resilient and alert the AI becomes to your tackles and dribbles. Something I have not seen before, but it's a mechanic which works extremely well in an attempt to avoid further catastrophes.\n+ Leaderboard and fame points work really well side by side. Adds a whole different layer of depth for players to continue playing and reach the Platinum League.\n+ 225 achievements and in-game trophies. That’s 225 individual pieces of effort and excruciating dedication to unlock.\n+ Match challenges offer objectives for players in search of small modifiers (ie. avoid using powers, score three goals in 30 seconds, and so on). You gain fame points in return for your efforts.\n+ Friendly user interface with all the standard options you would expect from a PC title.\n+ Online multiplayer is planned for release with the final version of the game.\n\nEarly access consideration and dev feedback\n- A friendly warning: The AI will torture you during your first few sessions/hours until you figure out how everything works. You may even grow suspicious of cheating AI. I most certainly did. The important thing is to try and play as much as you can to get to grips with the gameplay.\n- Slight overkill with AI catch up speed compared to player catch up. I don't feel like the sprint button does anything when chasing the AI.\n- The need for more power ups or other methods of scoring (ie. volley or header) is great.\n- There is an audio balancing issue. Almost all audio during play comes through the right speaker/headphone. I have tried using two perfectly functional headsets and a speaker to cancel any malfunctions on my end.\n- Only international teams are playable. It would be great to be able to play in a league filled with fictional teams/players, just to shrug off the feeling of international play. Pro Evolution Soccer has done this for many years with great success (ie. North London: Arsenal; Hampshire Red: Southampton; Merseyside Blue: Everton).\n- It would be an even greater feature to allow players the freedom to create their own teams, team names, players and kits from pre-made designs, then to incorporate this team to a randomly generated and fictional league.","February 7","true","8.7"," 23 of 25 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","23","25","0","1"

Game mostly based on you fast reaction.\n\nIn the game you will find in one team of 6 players, your main goal , is should be obviously, because this is a football game, so you should win a match. Beside this you will get for every match different goals like do clean sheet etc. Here to play you can pick a various national teams, but at the start only a few available, other ones you will unlock them when you win a different tournaments in different difficulty level. The basic is a football, but here you will not find too many rules, only some basic like a corned kick, throw in. Also here you will found some special skills what you get randomly after some time and can use it, for example super shoot or teleport.\nHere you will find besides a single player tournaments a local multiplayer mode and in future also an online multiplayer.\nThe game controls are very simple , you can easily learn a basic element, they are well presented in a text with picture, also you can do practice.\nThe game style well fit to the game style, all characters looks a bit funny, but nice. There you will not find to much sounds, but they are good.\n\nSo my verdict:\n\n+enjoyable gameplay\n+some unusual in football games\n+nice style\n+leaderboards\n+local multiplayer up to 5 player\n+different difficulty levels\n+steam cards and achievements\n\n-at the moment no online multiplayer (will come in future)\n-in some moments can be frustrating\n\nWell i think this game you should try out even if you are not a football fan. This game looks fun and can bring enjoyable moments for all age players. Gameplay is based in you skills and fast reaction, but after some practice this shouldn´t be a problem for you. So if you want to get some fresh experiences and try out your skills, this game is for you. Game still in early access, but the announced future updates should do this game even more funny and enjoyable.\n\n","March 9","true","7.3"," 21 of 27 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","21","27","0","4"

Overall I recommened this game to anyone that has that "sports itch" at the moment and is looking for something to play.  I also recommend to anyone that likes sports games in general too.\n\nFrom a singleplayer point of view:\n\nI was never into sports games or watched any sports in real life, but I do enjoy playing the games from time to time.  I am one of those that got the "sports itch", I looked around and saw this game.  The graphics are very welcoming and fun which pushed me to buy this.  When I started playing, I was amazed at how fun the game actually was, the overall mechanics are simple, but there is an underlying depth to it which makes it hard to master.\nAnyone can pick up this game and play it right away with no problem.  The fun factor was instant, I just wanted to play more and more.\n\nWhat also appealed to me is that, there aren't any rules, except when kicking the ball out of bounds, anything goes beyond that.  You can slide tackle all you want and watch your opponent eat grass all day if you want too.  This to me is awesome because sports games with all these rules turn me off, I just want to play for fun, if I want rules then I'll play the other fifa games or w/e.\n\nOverall I would recommend purchasing this game, especially if you play with friends, I can see lots of enjoyment coming out of it.  If not then definitely keep an eye out.","September 19, 2015","true","3.3"," 18 of 23 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","18","23","0","0"

But at a price point of 10.99 (CDN) there just is zero meat on the bone to want to keep playing. It took about 4 hours to play all the tournements on the beginner level to unlock the other ones. Then you are to move up to the next difficulty to again, unlock the next tiers of tournements.\n\nIn lies the rub, there is no variety in the games. Yes, it's soccer. But all it is as simply put is; slide tackle, run for 5 feet and then start spinning with the ball and hope the never missing AI might miss a tackle. Then use the sniper mode to aim for one of the corners..... Rinse repeat. That is the whole game. None of the teams have any 'differnce' other then the colours of their shirts/player faces. No team is better then the other and you can NEVER outrun a defender. If you have the ball you run at 75% speed any defenseman can run down forwards. It's just a little silly.\n\nIf it's on sale, grab it for a few hours of something sports on Steam. Don't expect it to hold your attention for long once you are past the first few games and your doing the exact thing every game.","February 20","false","5.1"," 21 of 30 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","21","30","0","0"

Khan, Pepe, J. Barton, Gattuso, R. Keane and Diego costa.\nAnd essentially just let them loose because this time there is no ref to sent them off.\n\nThe game sounds simple enough, all you got to do is score and everything is legal.\nBut its alot more challanging then it sounds. Well placed curlers, slide tackles to reach a pass that was a little off, and correctly timed interceptions is pretty much key in this game, aswell as obviously passing, crosses etc.\nThere is pretty much no time to rest or think of a strategy since its extremely fast paced.\n\nItll take quite some time befor unlocking every team/tournament, especially on harder difficulties.\n\nOh and playing this game as a local co-op with friends is def. recommended. Especially local 2vs2 is alot of fun. You will also learn too hate them every time they use a special power.","February 9","true","7.5"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","92","11","12","5","0"

You pick your team (5 players + 1 goal keeper) and you can play a friendly match or try to win a tournament or cup.\nThere are no fouls, no referees, no team formation, no tatics, no stamina.\nThe game has a smooth gameplay, you can tackle as much as you want, but that doesn't mean you're going to easily steal the ball.\nWhen you press and hold the kick button the game slows down and you can change the ball direction, making the goal keeper's life difficult.\nThe super-moves are a nice addition to the game: you can freeze your opponent, you can use a magnet to pull the ball, you can teleport to another region of the field, you can perform a super shot or use a windmaker to blow the ball away from your goal.\nYou can play locally with your friends: up to 5 local players, using gamepads and a keyboard.\nIn the beginning you can play just one tournament. You need to win it on the Beginner level to unlock another tournament and so on.\nEven though the game has 100+ teams you can pick just a few in the beginning and you need to unlock the other teams.\n\nRating:\n9/10\n\nPros: Cartoony and cute graphics.\nSimple gameplay.\nNice tutorial.\nAchievements.\nShort games.\nFast pace.\nYou can generate GIF from your goals.\nCons:\nThe team supporters are too quiet.\nThe AI difficult needs balancing. From the Beginner to the Amateur level it gets way too difficult. The devs are already working on it.\nThe ball rebounds needs improvement.

I totally love the cartoon-look of the game and the more or less easy controls. I can't really fit my thoughts into sentences so here is a little list of what I liked and what I missed:\n\n+ Cartoon-looks (also the very simple menu)\n+ Easy-Controls\n+ cool Idea of slowmotion when shooting\n+ one Challenge in each match (for example: Dribble the ball for 20 seconds)\n\n- many frameratedrops (I have quite a very good PC)\n- The practice wasn't playable for me with gamepad. Keyboard always was Player 1. (maybe I did miss how to change that)\n- Some translation-mistakes (german)\n- After selecting a team, I couldn't press "Start Match" with gamepad. Had to do it with Keyboard\n- Slowmotion effect didn't really brought action to me (Maybe adding a zoom or something? 0.4 sec of slowmotion didn't really made me "fear" if the ball is going in or not)\n- Some Challenges were little bit too hard (Scoring 3 goals in 25 seconds)\n- too few Power-ups in 4 minutes of gameplay\n\nWhat I'm missing in the game and is probably going to come:\n- Character (+Ball) customization\n- Replays\n- Selectable Celebrations\n- Harder Challenges get rewarded more\n- Online-matches\n- Some more crazyness (chaotic gamemodes, ((((playing as animals :D)))))\n--> more powerups in 4 minute matches\n\n\nI definitly will write another review of this game in some months, when development is more advanced.\nI also can't wait to play this game with a group of friends (5 Player can play local).\n\nThe developer Merixgames did a very good joob for this point.\n\nHope the review is helping you to buy this cool game!","December 23, 2015","true","3.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

What a move, Ladies and Gentlemen. Exceptional talent displayed from this player but . . . Hold on, WHAT A CRASHIIIING TACKLE from the second defender, so hard that his boots are the only remains on the pitch! Did you see where he landed, guys?” I love commentating Kopanito All-Stars Soccer matches; we see great moves, great tackles and no dives! Plenty of boots here and there but definitely no dives.\n\nKopanito All-Stars Soccer is a fast paced arcade-ish sports game. As per the intro, this sports game is absolutely frantic, to say the least! Well, there are no referees on the pitch and we do not care about this silly offside rule. All we have is two teams of six players each who go in to battle fiercely to win the match.  You will be able to use super moves when you fill the energy bar (I call it that), every successful pass, tackle, shot and goal will help you to increase your charge bar. Then you might get the super shot and score; you might get the magnet to pull the ball back to you (this is what Germany used in the Semi-final against Brazil in the latest World cup, for sure); you might teleport a player up field, or even get a massive ventilator behind the net so the ball can’t cross the line! JUST FUN!\n\n16 tournaments and leagues to play either solo or with friends on local multiplayer which supports up to five players (four on gamepads and one at the keyboard) and four levels of difficulty. I would recommend that you start playing on the beginner level for a while and familiarise yourself with the gameplay. As soon as you move up to the amateur, the difficulty increases dramatically.\n\nDuring each match, you will be given a challenge - if you manage to succeed you will receive points and in-game achievements. 114 national teams to choose from but a large number of them need to be unlocked.\n\nI really like the cartoonish graphics; the game is very well balanced and the controls very responsive.\n\nPositives:\n~~~~~~~\n\n-	Really fun gameplay\n-	Great cartoon graphics\n-	100’s of national teams to play\n-	Great number of tournaments and leagues to play (including custom ones)\n-	Local multiplayer\n-	Trading cards\n-	Stacks of achievements\n\nNegatives:\n~~~~~~~~\n\n-	The levels of difficulty increase rather steeply\n\nIt is fast, fun, competitive and even frustrating at times. Kopanito All-Stars Soccer is a must-have!\n\n9/10\n\nKey provided by developer/publisher for review purposes.

It has even better playability than SWOS. It's a great achievment, because it's much more advanced than Sensible Software masterwork. As in SWOS you used one key to any action (passing, lobing striking, tackling) - here you have 5-6. But do not worry - difficulty levels will help you to advance (or you can still have lot of fun on the easiest difficulty setting).\n\nCreative and dynamic game, lot of fun (e.g. super powers) - the all you want.","January 16","true","68.3"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Whose not charmed by cute cartoony graphics? I’m sorry if that’s not you but it describes me. I’m not as deeply passionate about football (soccer) as I am about other sports but as a sports mad Australian I do love watching it from time to time and I certainly enjoy playing the hell out of football games. Football Manager, a bit of FIFA, Pro Evolution Soccer, etc. that’s me to a tea. So when I saw Merixgames’ Kopanito All-Stars Soccer on the Steam store I was all over that like a bad rash.\n\nKopanito is as basic to play as any sports game on Steam. A controller, though I believe that you can play with keyboard, and some two button mashing and you’re all set. Or are you? Although those are all you need to start playing the game caught me by its difficulty in my opening few matches. The goalies were almost impossible to beat. The game seemed to be unbeatable. But then suddenly I worked out a few strategies. Because the game is such a casual game of football so too are the rules. Literally. The tackle button immediately became one my favorite action in the game. Kevin Muscat eat your heart out. The dirtier you play the more chance you have to win because it means that you have a greater likelihood of winning possession. There’s even a special little trick where you can keep attempting to tackle the opposition goalkeeper when they have the ball and occasionally, ever so semi infrequently, will jar the ball loose and into the goal. The only rules that are called are out-of-bounds and corner kicks. The rest of the game is a mad cap free for all. As disappointed as I may sound it actually adds to the casualness of the game which is a good rather than bad. It’s just not going to suit those seeking a hyper realistic experience.\n\nLearning the necessary skills such as shooting, passing, etc. and then ultimately learning how to best utilize the various special power ups that the game has built into it are important on the higher difficulty settings. This will bring those of you who want a casual yet hard and rewarding challenge well and truly worth it. The addition of Steam achievements would be a nice touch later on but for now are unimportant. What is important is getting all of the features the dev team want to put into their game. But there are no massive complaints at this stage. The game looks, plays and feels as good as a casual sports game needs to look.\n\nKopanito All-Stars Soccer is the perfect game for those looking to scratch a sports game itch without having to dive into something as serious as Pro Evolution Soccer or deeper still a Football Manager.","January 14","true","6.4"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

I, along with my 6-year-old son, have completely fallen in love with this game!  This is the best football game on Steam, bar none.  Better than Pro Evo and light-years ahead of FIFA.\n\nIt's one of those games where you look at it and think, meh.  Then you play it for the first time and probably still think, meh.  Then you play it a second, a third and a forth time - and then you start to get the feel for it.  Then it becomes amazing!\n\nIn my opinion, there have only ever been 2 truly great football games.  Sensible Soccer on the Amiga and ISS Pro Evolution (1 & 2) on the original PlayStation.  You could argue Kick Off 2 to make 3 truly great games, but I always much preferred Sensi!  Kopanito, if the devs can crack it, has the potential to sit proudly beside those 2 (or 3) games.  Quite simply, the potential of this game is enormous.  Given Steam's massive user base and connectivity, something which neither of those previously mentioned greats had the privilege of playing to, Kopanito finds itself on the fringes of greatness.  I really hope it can make it!\n\nThe game plays a lot like Super Mario Strikers, which was released on the GameCube in 2005.  It also plays similar to Sensible Soccer, except the ball (usually) always sticks to your feet and the view is horizontal rather than vertical.  If you liked either of those games, I think it's safe to say you will love Kopanito.\n\nThe game is still in Early Access.  The presentation is a bit rough around the edges and there are still a few bugs to iron out.  The gameplay is already verging on perfection though.  Just a few tweaks needed to tidy it up.\n\nLike I said, the potential for this game is enormous.  As much as I love it right now, in my opinion, the game needs to try and move away from the style of Super Mario Strikers and become more like Sensible Soccer.  If the devs could somehow manage to incorporate both game types, each one selectable as an option, then that would quite simple be the holy grail!  A game that, I would imagine, would sell by the bucketload...\n\nRegarding the visuals, I wasn't sure about the cartoon look at first, but I've since grown to love it.  Also, I understand the copyright problems regarding kits, but they need to at least be the same basic colours as those in real life.  The kits are easily editable, though and it won't be long before identical kits are available by way of mod files.\n\nI can't wait to see how this game progresses.  I hope, like Sensi and ISS Pro Evo, that I will still be playing Kopanito in 5 or 10 years time.  Please make it happen!","January 16","true","156.2"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

I really enjoy soccer games overall, especially ones that don't take it too seriously. Mario Strikers Charged was one of my all-time favorites and the existing reviews, when I bought Kopantio, reflected the same love for the Wii title.\n\nWhat I love about this one are:\n-The number of teams and tournaments available\n-The fact that the teams are small. Five a side plus keeps is perfect.\n-Trick shots and trick defence.\n-The price is not unreasonable at all\n\nThat said, what I find troubling:\n-The fact that a majority of the teams and tournaments need to be unlocked and the easier difficulties may still too hard to unlock the things you want to unlock\n-The slide-tackling mechanic needs work. Missing a slide tackle is fun when your opponent jukes you, but not when you were a micrometer off on your analog joystick\n-My plug in controllers were garbage in Practice mode, but somehow work in other modes\n\nOne more troubling thing I should mention:\nI have a 10 minute rule, where if I can't have a meaningful game play experience in 10 minutes, I ask for a refund. I did this with Crusader Kings II, as I didn't have a clue of what I was doing. Anyway, It took me a good 20 minutes to figure out the plug in controller situation (I broke my own rule because I wanted to like this game so much). My advice to devs is this: Make this bug your highest priority.

I can't stand the sport as a real thing but casual arcade fun is great so I saw this and thought "hmm this looks like jokes" The thing that got me is that it is both fun and serious which is fantastic. I don't have to watch stupid transfers and training; I can just play but I have to play well. There's a lot of skill involved in playing this but not necessarily at the start which is good. It gives you time to warm to the controls and play around with the super skills - which are hilarious.\n\nOverall, the game may look silly but it's a real football game. The one thing that threw me off was that I had hoped it was an online multiplayer but unfortunately not.

The learning curve from beginner to amateur level is immense and seemingly insurmountable. Things that would let the computer take the ball from the player have no result when the player attempts them against the computer. Maybe if a player learned the secret commands the computer seemingly has access to (as well as instant knowledge of all actions taken without consideration for human reaction time) the playing field would be more level.","April 12","false","7.6"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

Fun game with tons to unlock, for $12 why the hell not?","April 25","true","3.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Still did the same slow download for a good ol 256 w/e mb. Still froze at the end of the download, was able to restart steam this time and it finished downloading. Back to a positive review...for the most part. Great arcade style soccer game. Nice visual updates recently as well. GPU usage is still all over the place however.","April 22","true","20.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Some major things are missing here.\n\nI highly recommend if they are able to add online multiplayer..  I feel like there's a big chunk of mechanics missing as well, like the x button should do something on defense.  Arial plays; headers, chest traps, and bicycle kicks are completely absent.  one-timers need to be smoothed a little.\n\n","May 27","true","6.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
