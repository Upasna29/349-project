Rekshun","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rKrDuDe265/","357 products in account","These guys are seriously charging $5 for this garbage? When you look at this store page, you're not watching a trailer. That's a full walkthrough, because that's literally all you can do. You walk in a straight line, sit on a bench, listen to a song with subtitles on, and walk the f**k out. Game over.\n\nYet despite how small this game is (at 47 Mb), they still couldn't even make it run properly. It skip and jitters almost constantly, and it's not just me. You can even see it in their "trailer". Not to mention the fact that when I played it, the old woman's animations glitched and I was unable to get up from the bench (or so I thought. Turns out that spending $5 let's the old lady kick the bucket while sitting on the bench). How f*****g incompetent do you have to be to make a game (and I'm being generous by calling it that) that's only 5 f*****g minutes long and still have it run like garbage and experience glitches? I saw the flat 2d tree decals disappear in fron of my eyes multiple times, and the shadows appear to be doing something which can only be described as "sh*****g themselves".\n\nI'm so happy that this was gifted to me as a joke because if I had paid even a penny for this pretentious mound of dog s**t, I probably would have shot somebody. I can understand attempting to make an artistic statement with a game but there's nothing here to begin with. The only emotion this envoked was confusion. And not at anything that I played, I was just confused as to how the hell this got released.\n\nI never thought that I would look at a game and genuinely regret wasting time on it, but congratulations "Tale of Tales", you did it.","November 27, 2013","false","0.3"," 134 of 168 people (80%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","80","134","168","9","3"

You play as an elderly lady in a graveyard and your only possible action is to walk forwards until you reach a bench and sit down. A song then plays for a few minutes and you either get up before the song ends or you remain and quietly die. That is the entire game.\n\nInterestingly enough, for a game that has absolutely no gameplay The Graveyard actually has a gamebreaking bug. If you remain seated during the song and die you will be forced to use ALT-F4 to end the game as the only real way to exit is to get up before the song ends.\n\nPoetry, Art, Experience. I do like that there are game developers out there that are experimenting with new things but charging gullible consumers money to play, what is essentially a postcard where you have to press the forward key for a few seconds to see it all, is just dishonest and greedy.\n\nThis is not a game, some might consider it art. I consider it a money grab.","June 18, 2013","false","100.6"," 66 of 79 people (84%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","84","66","79","2","0"

I do. I've actually played other 'games' like that. The thing is, those were mostly very well done. This is crap.\n\nIt uses standard wasd controls, but a and d turn instead of strafe. This makes movement awkward unless you're going straight forward. Fortunately(?), the camera angle is fixed and you have literally nowhere else to go because invisible walls block you from leaving the path forward in any meaningful way. Technically, you can travel a brief distance down the side paths before encountering them, but that hardly makes any difference.\n\nThe worst part, really, is that it fails even at what should be its strength. The movements are poorly executed and frequently fail to match up properly with the environment. The birds, about the only moving things in the game apart from the protagonist, constantly clip through objects such as your character and the pavement. And the art assets themselves, even on highest settings, are mediocre at best in comparison with other 3D games of the last 5 years or more, and often considerably shabbier.\n\nYour experience of the game will not even vary in any significant way as near as I can tell. You will walk her to the end of the path where she will sit on the bench. Then, a transparent profile of her will appear along the right side of the screen, and a song about death sung in German plays, with subtitles. At some point during this song, she will die.\n\nThe instructions are misleading, as they say you will walk her back out of the graveyard, ending the game, after it is done. I did three playthroughs, altering various things to try and see if she would survive so that I could, indeed, walk her back out and end the game properly, including going very slowly and letting her rest frequently and at length, in case it was linked to overexertion (perhaps as a way of punishing the player for not taking the time to appropriately appreciate this 'art'?). In the end, nothing worked. One of the only things I did not try was turning clockwise to sit down on the bench instead of counter-clockwise, and the idea that this could be the deciding factor is asinine, and I refuse to waste any more time experimenting with it because the game is so tedious and boring.\n\nI honestly don't even know why this is for sale. I could see this being made as a hobby project or maybe some kind of tech demo, but charging money for it seems almost unconscionable. This is easily in the running for the worst game on Steam.\n\nIn short, if you still have any interest in this, just watch a youtube video of a playthrough instead. You'll get the exact same experience minus pressing the w key and then a or d to turn around and sit (which she does automatically). Don't waste your money on it.","June 15, 2013","false","0.5"," 56 of 64 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","56","64","0","5"

I feel he was ripped off and should be given a refund. I've never been irritated by a gift before, but this one left me wishing I could have the time I wasted back. The only difference between the full version and the free one is... she dies on the bench. No sense of reflection. No walking back to the fence. No exploration of the graveyard (in either version). The entire game is shown in the trailer above. The instructions also detail the entire game (I wanted INSTRUCTIONS, not a plot spoiler with no alert... if you call that a plot... ?)\n\nThe reviews are complete jokes. Most are mocking the game... yet giving it a thumbs up? Thanks, guys. Way to encourage everyone to waste money on this, rather than on other artistic games - ones that have real time and effort put into them.\n\nYes, I love art. Yes, I own and love quite a few games that are artistic and most are rather short. Yet they tell a simple story. Some have had me in tears. I'll never forget the impact those indie games had on me. Their styles can be very unique, which is why some people do not even call them games. But this? This is incomplete and pathetic. I waited for 15 minutes for something... ANYTHING... to happen before I finally had to "force quit" in order to exit the game.\n\nWhy should we support these indie developers? If they want your money, they should at least have the sense to put a "quit" or "exit" button at the end. Regardless, this takes less than two minutes to complete. It's not interactive. You don't even control when she sits down. You can't look at any of the gravestone. Come on, seriously? I don't understand why Steam even allowed this to be posted here.","January 2, 2015","false","0.3"," 63 of 89 people (71%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","71","63","89","5","2"

You play as a three-legged elderly woman exploring robust and realistic looking graveyard. Along the way you will encounter birds, a stone wall, stone tombstones, foliage and more until you get to the final boss, a standard sized park bench.  What happens next will leave you breathless.\n\nControls: 3/10\nResident Evil style controls with up and down moving forward and backward while left and right are used to turn. Grandma is as slow as a tank but without the bonus of destroying everything in her path. And when she finally does destroy the only thing she can, there is no way to quit the game after your victory. Also, there is no controller support.\n\nGraphics: 7/10\nSome nice chiaroscuro in a beautifully rendered locale. Grandma's thick saggy jowls are a bit outdated, but you can imagine what she might have looked like 60 years ago.\n\nSound: 6/10\nPleasant sounds of a park; not even grandma's death get in their way. Or did you not play the full version?\n\nMusic: 5/10\nAll that setup just to get me to listen to a song by some guy named Gerry De Mol. He also has a song called "Doof Me" that you can check out on youtube.\n\nCamera: 4/10\nAssuming this was an open world graveyard game, I tried taking grandma down a side path in the cemetery to give her a little more time in this world and see if I could get any power-ups before facing the final boss. The camera didn't follow her movements and she disappeared. Having little value for my own time left on this planet, I tried to turn her around and have her walk back without seeing her movements (instead of just having her walk backwards) and ended up losing even more of my own life to this game. Now that I think about it, I never actually tried to walk backwards in The Graveyard, but I wouldn't be surprised if the programmers left that function out since time only moves forward.\n\n\nFinal Thoughts:\n**Spoiler** If grandma doesn't die in the demo then isn't the promise of eternal life free? If you pay for things, you die; and please listen to Gery De Mol: that's the real message here.\n\nThe creators really should have added a 2x speed option for those of us who would have preferred a painless death.\n\nIf you want to experience a graveyard on a nice day, go to a graveyard. If you want to see death up close, spend your $5 on a bus ticket to a retirement home. If you want to hole yourself up into a virtual solitude, put a blanket over your head, grab a bowl of popcorn and enjoy the final cutscene of The Graveyard. It will bring you closer to death.","September 25, 2015","false","0.2"," 31 of 36 people (86%) found this review helpful 26 people found this review funny","86","31","36","26","0"

On the other hand you would not call it a game. It is no game and I feel an little resistance in my inner guts to go so far and call it art or an experience of any kind.\n\nThere shouldn't be to much words about this... whatever you might call it, but I will give you an inside perspective of my kind of view on this one as well as any other... thing... in my game list.\n\nThe wonderful world of surroundings that point your eye when you start the game might give you high hopes on the graveyard. It turns out that the atmosphere happens to be kind of relaxed and the black & white effect is underlining the cold but still hopeful overall touch that goes smooth with the sounds. As you keep going forward at the incredible speed of continents drifting away, you might consider what this world would look like if it had more colours in it or if it would have hurt to speed up the granny by giving her rocket powered rollerblades.\n\nAs you keep passing the stones on the sight of the walk, you start to witness black birds and start asking yourself if you could fight back if an baby would happen to come by and steel your purse right before the bird attacks. Time goes by and you start to ask yourself what the name of this dot-based flashgame was where you happen to live an whole life from born to death in about 30 seconds and you wonder how many times you could have played it by now.\n\nLater in game you happen to get to the next task. You have reached the bench and you have to turn around and sit down - all together at the actual speed of dripping stalactites (thank god this is going into automatic, otherwise I wouldn't have made it)\n\nThe next step is hard and sometimes glitchy, but I think that you might be able to do it anyway: Hold still. I know it sounds crazy and after all the rushing you might be thinking that you are unable to hold back, but try to ignore the spiders that try to use your armpits for webbing nets and chill for a second.\n\nThe music you can hear has subtitles in many languages, even in english. If you are going to freak out at this point and you start screaming: "What is this? How do they even come up with the idea that I might be able to understand english in the first place?!" I can chill you here. You might think that you can't understand that language, but it is only because of the long time of isolation that you have been gone through since starting the graveyard.\n\nAfter a short while you will then slowly pass away. Everything will become grey highlighted and peaceful. About 5 minutes after that, the old lady in the game will also pass away.\n\nI know that I am on a point now where I would usually rate the game by my personal experience and than give an last catchy phrase next to it, so you get to see if it is fun or not, but I kind of got into an state of xtasy as if acid would run through my veins and I can not just go with something easy.. so I need to calm for a second.\n\nThinking...\n\n...keep thinking....\n\n..well..\n\nokay...\n\n..I think I know\n\n\n$#/10 "I don't know!"

I was stricken by an overwhelming sense of serenity and appreciation. Over out at the lake there sat an island with a giant tree, who's branches had been made home to a number of birds nests. From the lake, I could catch sight of elderly men fishing, children playing with bread crumbs and ducks, a couple holding hands and taking a walk, a shirtless man on a jog, two women passing by on a bike. Every one of them wrapped up in their own world, but all the same, part of an ecological system that brought upon a feeling of peace, safety, and a certain pure beauty that made me aware of just how nice the cool breeze felt running across my skin from the hot summer heat, the underlying frailness of some waterside flowers that reflected beautifully on the lake's surface, and the pleasures of smell the fauna brought simply from its own life and death cycle.\n\nNone of that resonated in this lifeless game, it has absolutely no artistic merit, and the song sucked.\n\n10/10, would put my wrinkly old woman butt on a bench again.","July 28, 2014","true","0.8"," 33 of 49 people (67%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","67","33","49","6","2"

The only diference from the complete version is that, in the complete version the old lady dies. And it is not a spoiler, it is told in game. So when you buy it (if you buy) you won't feel cheated and you will know that you bought just for support indie and artistic games.\n\nProbably, when you play The Graveyard you will say: Man! What the ♥♥♥♥ is that?! - And, ironicly, that's why I recomend this game.\n\nYeah... I said that too. However I played it several times wondering what Tale of Tales was trying to do when they made this, and I think I found the answer.\n\nWhile mixing game and art, Tale of Tales tried to create in the gamer the defamiliarization that all the artistic work aims. So, after the defamiliarization, you need to open your eyes because you have a new and unknown thing before your eyes.\n\n"The Graveyard" isn't a good game. Some will say it isn't a game at all, some will say it is pretentious. This game is not pretentious. Tale of Tales is not pretentious. This is a very good piece of art IMO. It is just hard to understand. I can say one thing: It is a freaking "shock treatment" for the expansion of concepts, and that's why I recomend it.\n\nIf you want give it a try, play the demo.\n\nBut you'll ask: How much you liked The Graveyard.\nI liked enough to ask for a translation for my language.\nI liked enough to offer myself to translate it.\nAnd I did it.\n\nAnd I am proud.","November 27, 2013","true","0.8"," 21 of 28 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","21","28","0","2"

You walk (slowly) to a bench, turn around and sit down, then contemplate life while listening to a song. It actually even has something extra in the video, as after three full playthroughs, my old lady never stayed alive long enough to get up off the bench and walk out of the graveyard. Coincidentally, this is what you need to do in order to actually exit the game via the game controls, meaning I needed to exit via keyboard shortcuts every time. I guess when they say the full version includes the chance of death, they really mean that there's a very small chance of living. I can't stand playing any more to see how many attempts it takes. In any case, as much as I actually tend to enjoy the "art" games, this really has nothing worthwhile to it. Of course, having gotten it in a bundle with other games I actually wanted, I really don't care, but if you are thinking of spending money on this, go watch paint dry for five minutes instead. You'll have almost as worthwhile of an experience. I will give them this, in that the game description is quite accurate, though "explorable" and "walk around" are stretching things a lot. I was expecting to actually be able to, I don't know, maybe walk around and explore the graveyard on my way to the bench.","May 11, 2015","false","0.3"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

It's unfortunate that most of Tale of Tales games seem to be less a game and more a proof of concept or tech demo of sorts. Whilst the developer manages to create a unique experience they don't actually do anything to take advantage of it. It's as if Tale of Tales is an advertising agency, creating 30 second commercials, amongst a sea of giants who make 2-3 hour feature films. Yet they still charge a similar price of admission.\n\nIf you want to make the experience infinitely more amusing, throw on some DMX (I recommend Party Up) whilst you spend five minutes walking down the path of a graveyard to sit on the bench of existentialism.","March 6, 2013","false","1.2"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","2"

Gifted to me by a close and dear friend, known for his witty choice of games, I was originally skeptical. The download for the game was quick and efficient. Upon first opening the game you are thrown straight into the gameplay, this originally threw me off guard as the controls were quite hard to get used to. However with perseverance anything can be achieved. After I had fully mastered the controls I began the game, before playing I advise you get headphones to play as the music is truly inspirational and the game is not complete without it.\nThe first thing you see after starting the game is a divinely animated graveyard with a variety of different grave designs included. The lady you control moves at a smooth speed, which one could compare to a the speed of which a snail moves towards a particularly appetisizing piece of grass. The goal is far in the distance though, being not as smart as many players who had played this game prior to me I had to check the menu, which can be found by pressing the escape key. The goal is to get to the bench in the center of the graveyard. On the way towards the bench I found myself going on a journey into my inner consciousness, questioning my very existence upon this world. To sit down on the bench upon arrival you must slowly direct the lady backwards onto the bench until she glimpses poetically back at the bench before firmly placing herself on it. This is where the real story begins.\n\nSitting on the bench transports you to an entirely new plain of existence. This is the part of the game which you definately need headphones for as the music here is both emotive and inspiring. Though the song sang is in german it speaks to you on an emotional level, without reading the lyrics I instantly knew everything the song was saying and I almost felt as though I was the lady I controlled. The emotions of her past flooded into my mind, emotions I have never felt before and I am sure I will never feel again. To my suprise once the song ended the lady did not wake up and I now know this happened because it is possible in rare circumstances for the lady to die, of natural causes, during the game. This came as a shock to me and something shifted inside my heart. "Why was I chosen to witness this" I have asked myself every night before I fall asleep and the only answer I could find was that I had been chosen by her.\nWriting this review I am finding it hard to control my urge to cry as this game has truly touched me in many ways.\nMasterpieces like this are hard to find these days so I strongly suggest you buy this game.\nWell done Tell a Tale games. 10/10.","November 1, 2015","true","4.1"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","55","6","11","4","2"

It's an art experiment. I sort of enjoyed the idea, and I support the fact that it exists, but for anyone looking for more than a few minutes of something vaguely interesting, I guess I can't really recommend it. As I said already, it really isn't a game at all. There are "games as art" types who would probably not appreciate this, but, as much as I can in fact get behind this sort of thing, it really has no lasting value. Hum.

I loaded it up and was instantly assaulted by spinning .jpeg trees.  I ignored those though, instead focusing on the atmosphere.  As I made my way to the bench, the futility of it all slowly grasped me.  I began to think about what the old woman had been through - how many of the graves surrounding us were her friends?  Her kin?\n\nAs I urged the woman ever closer to the bench, I began to feel that we shared the struggle - and furthermore, that it was a pointless one.  I thought that maybe if we just gave up, it would all end.  Was there really a reason to keep moving forward?  To crawl through life with nothing to live for?  The game became real to me...  And then we reached the bench.\n\nAs soon as we sat down, this god-awful song started playing.  It completely destroyed the atmosphere, and the emotions that were building up in my mind.  And it lasted for minutes.  After it finally ended, the struggle of moving through the graveyard became a race to end the game as quickly as possible.  In the description of the game it says that it's supposed tell a story without words, but there was a lot of those in that horrible, horrible song.\n\nIf that was removed from the game, I would rate it positively.  As it is, I'd give it 2/10.  I know it's harsh to rate it so low, but the song took up a good half of my playthrough, and ruined the last walking sequence.  Therefore only the first couple minutes were actually worth playing.  You done goof'd.\n\ntl;dr: I got attached to the woman because my vivid imagination made it all very real.  After we reached the bench, the whole dark little world I had built up in my mind was shattered by that terrible song.  2/10\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd yes, it took me more time to write this review than to play through the game.","December 28, 2014","false","0.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","1","0","0"

I was a little old lady in a graveyard, not great right? I thought I'd explore to begin with. Turns out you can't do that. The camera doesn't follow you off screen and with slow walking and tank controls I thought I'd lost my character and had to restart. I managed to get back on screen again and made my way to a bench. So far I've been playing for 5-6 minutes and I've literally walked to a bench and sat down. Then old lady starts looking around aimlessly. This goes on for maybe 30 seconds untill she keels over and dies. As if that wasn't bad enough, some terrible German pop music about people dying starts playing. Then nothing. Just watching some old dead ♥♥♥♥♥ on a bench and little birdies occasionally landing then flying off untill finally I get bored and have to open task manager just to close it. I'd have a very hard time recommending this game to anyone, I genuinely think I've found real graveyards more entertaining.","September 26, 2012","true","0.3"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","2"

The old lady can die as well but I haven't experienced that (yet). It's weird, it's twisted, it isn't fun. If you look at it like some sort of art game, then it still isn't fun, but you'll probably understand why they created it.\n\n[Rating: 52/100]","July 2, 2011","false","0.1"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

Possibly could have just been a video. All I could do is control her walking very slowly, which basically ended up with her walking into an invisible wall because she only goes to the graveyard with the intention of sitting down, not wanting to look around or, say, visit anyone she has lost. You could start rambling about deep meaning you found in the game, but I'm pretty sure you can do that with many things.... for free. Pretentious stuff, perhaps an artsy project for school or something they decided to try to get money from. Luckily I only got it in a bundle, so can just hide it from my library and forget about it.\n\nI can appreciate things without action or explosions, and I didn't expect it to be a game or anything long, but there was no story here at all and the artwork and music was actually pretty rubbish. Isn't that essential for a good atmospheric experience? I know it isn't exactly new, but it is poor even for 2008. Perhaps it is about time it became free to.... "play".

Possibly could have just been a video. All I could do is control her walking very slowly, which basically ended up with her walking into an invisible wall because she only goes to the graveyard with the intention of sitting down, not wanting to look around or, say, visit anyone she has lost. You could start rambling about deep meaning you found in the game, but I'm pretty sure you can do that with many things.... for free. Pretentious stuff, perhaps an artsy project for school or something they decided to try to get money from. Luckily I only got it in a bundle, so can just hide it from my library and forget about it.\n\nI can appreciate things without action or explosions, and I didn't expect it to be a game or anything long, but there was no story here at all and the artwork and music was actually pretty rubbish. Isn't that essential for a good atmospheric experience? I know it isn't exactly new, but it is poor even for 2008. Perhaps it is about time it became free to.... "play".

The "gameplay" is literally 5 minutes (the other 5 is checking online if really that was all there is to it, and figuring out how to exit the game as there's no exit function >.> )\n\nI don't recommend it. Even if I take it as an attempt at some atmospheric artsyness, the graphics are kinda bad (kept being distracted by the trees' revolving paper thin foliage), and the song is both way too cheerful for this game and kinda boring and pointless O.o I regret the 50p I spent on this "game" D:","September 26, 2015","false","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I really should have read all the information around here because there are enough signs that say that this "game" is not good.. well this isnt even a game.\n\nIt is a shame to call this a game. This is more like an example for tryhard "art" - pure nonsense. It is not emotional, it doesnt have a "deeper sense", it doesnt have a good atmosphere or a message.\n\nHow to "beat" this game:\n1) Start the game\n2) Hold the "W" key for around 2 minutes\n3) When you reach the bench, turn around and sit down\n4) Listen to a horrible song and die\n5) The end (you have to close the game via taskmanager..)\n\n\nSeriously this is just a scam like Bientot lete and I stop here because I already wasted more time to write this review than someone needs to "beat" this game.\n\nBtw I tried to survive the game several times but it seems that she dies every time.","November 14, 2015","false","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

No, don't sit there like a muppet, buy it.","January 30, 2012","true","0.3"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"
