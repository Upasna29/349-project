The entire game is full of clumsily written speeches that feels more like they're coming from the author than the characters themselves.\n\nA huge focus in this game is discrimination, which I thought would be interesting. But instead of being shown instances of the discrimination our PC apparently faces we're just sort of told it exists. According to the author we're obviously supposed to care about it, and you don't really have much of a choice.\n\nIf you choose to be uninterested in politics and instead focus on your sister (who is DYING by the way) you're almost punished and berated by the game, which is absurd. The author also seems to hold a bit of a grudge against certain characters, like the character Griffin (who's a RO!) whose only crime as far as I know is that he enjoys a bit of attention and isn't very bright.\n\nThe author really needs to begin distancing themselves a bit from what they're writing because it's not doing them any favours. There's nothing wrong with having social commentary in your game. But author, if you're reading this, please try taking a step back in your next games and let the characters and world speak for itself. It's jarring to feel judged for your choices by the author in a game that's supposedly built on choices.","April 8","false","4.5"," 161 of 173 people (93%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","93","161","173","5","0"

I had high hopes this would be of similar take. So I will just list a few things here in the likes and dislikes to avoid spoilers and other fun stuff.\n\nLikes:\n*The characters, far more diversed this time around.\n*Anything with you doing hero work proverbially.\n\nDislikes:\n*When you aren't doing hero things, story drags and gets a little to hung up on political way to much for my taste.\n*Felt rushed and then incomplete. I know this is the first of the new set, but I was left more going okay, then I enjoyed it like the first three.\n*The lack of connection to characters, while there are a ton of interesting you never really interact at all in the story. Felt the connections were stronger in the first three.\n* Another area where stats are built like money and serve no purpose, I want to see it matter.\n\nSo I will stop there, this isn't a bad game, it just feels weaker then the others. I will likely buy the sequel to this just to see if it picks up. I will only recommend this to fans who enjoyed the series and want to see it start fresh with a slightly new outlook. Otherwise I would say skip this until the second story is out and buy them in a cheap set.\n\n","April 8","false","5.4"," 70 of 75 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","70","75","0","0"

I didn't like this one. The game doesn't make me feel like the main character as much as just being an excuse to have to read very preachy thinly veiled propaganda over and over again. The second interlude felt extremely artificial for instance. i've racked up a lot of hours in this game simply because I couldn't do more than a few pages at a time before needing a break from it, and left it running while tabbing out.\n\ni believe the creator will salvage it, this is more a prologue for the actual story I hope.. But compared to the other Heroes games and the Versus game.. this is really weak. On it's own, I would never recommend it.

Sad to hear, but I'll continue to support the series no matter what. I have been following the game since the first day so to say that the game is a bit of a disappointment is an understatement. I like it of course, excited to see the next part but let's me just say, the game feels really disconnected somehow. I still love it though, would look forward to see more stories from the author but this is just not my favourite installment in Heroes Rise world.\n\n\nThe game on Steam version seems to work fine, albeit a few glitch then and there but the game for iOS version seems to have the stat screen frozen which is pretty much uh? I paid most of my time on the iOS version instead of the PC version, but I finished it a few times already so here goes.\n\nThe interactions are lacking. You get to see from others' perspectives twice in the story, that's nice. But outside of that, there aren't much interaction with other characters. Instead, you get to see from the eyes of these seemingly important but in reality, doesn't make much of an impact on the main character. Of course, Weaver works as your handler and you can unlock of a romance with him, that's nice. Lyra is the producer, but to be honest, so far, I really don't care about her. It's a nice tidbit to know what happened between your character and their romance partner but the lack of response for Prodigal romance kinda hurt. Especially since she uploads her personality to MeChip server, I would like her MeChip personality to at least acknowledge of the hero.\n\nThe Finalists go by in a breeze, some characters receive more attention than others, only for them to be kicked off the show in the blink of an eye. Other characters like Crystalline, Transfer, etc. receive an enough amount attention to get to know them. But their personality also gets extremely ambiguous at one point, it might cause disinterests in many people. It's nice to see the characters from the previous game to come back like Mach Girl, Fumble, etc. But interactions with them only go as far as that.\n\nAs some previous reviewers stated, the game focused too much on discrimination against the character's Powered ability without proving it. Remember, showing not telling. Or else the reader won't be able to relate to the problem since it's pretty obvious to most that the sister is in dire need of help and deserve more attention from them. Which is true, and I believe many others would also choose to focus on saving her. That said, I also like JK a lot, she's really interesting and it's nice to have a sibling this time. But in the end, the writing's still more or less too personal.\n\nI also wonder if it's possible to delete saves in the future since I have a lot from old games and it's cluttering up.","April 10","false","1.2"," 33 of 39 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","33","39","0","1"

I really enjoyed the previous Heroes Rise games, and I liked Versus, and I want to like Redemption Season. The problem is it's over the top portrayal of discrimination. Every other page the author feels the need to preach to you about oppression and social justice. And God forbid if you try to take a rational or middle road opinion, you'll be seen as a villain.\n\nNow, over the course of all of these games in the Heroes Rise series a common theme reveals itself, there is no room for nuance. You're only ever allowed to have a one sided opinion. If you try to keep a rational balance of opinions you're punished for it. I can't in good conscience recommend this game. If this is made into a new trilogy it might be worth a look, if and only if the author tones down on the social justice monologuing in a massive way, it'd be way more fun to read.","April 17","false","22.4"," 21 of 25 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","21","25","0","0"

The Heroes Rise Trilogy was great, so when I found out that this game came out, I bought it instantly.\nIt was a mistake.\nOther reviews have mentioned this, but this game was unbearably preachy. I can't really even remember the lacklustre storyline because I was being bombarded by laughable characters left and right and extremely cringe-worthy social commentary.\nI understand that the author feels (very) strongly about his views, and it is fine to put them in a game, but in moderation, please. There was a certain point where I got tired of reading about how oppressed everyone was that I just started skimming the social commentary until I got to the actual story. Occasionally I would stop and read what the characters were saying and just roll my eyes because of how ridiculous it was.\nThe issues of the 'Underrepresented' was probably the main focus of this game, and they completely overshadowed everything else. Almost every single character in this game is 'Underrepresented' in some way and they will absolutely not allow you to forget that!\nAlso, in order to get a good outcome, the author basically forces you to become a social justice warrior. If you adopt an alternative social stance, you are punished with a character dying. If you decide that focusing on saving your dying sister is more important than championing social equality for all, she ends up hating you.\nTo sum it up, I didn't enjoy this game at all and unless you are (very!) into the idea of becoming a SJW with superpowers, you mostly likely would not enjoy this either.","May 2","false","3.7"," 20 of 24 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","20","24","0","0"

It ends extremely abruptly and without much resolution. It is perhaps, the longest of the 4 games but that only serves to add to the annoyance when you come to the end and it feels so rushed and incomplete. Obviously we're aiming for another trilogy here.\n\nAlso, this may be an unpopular opinion but I feel as though the constant focus on 'gender indentity' takes me out of the story somewhat. Words like 'ze' and 'hir' just served to become more annoying as the game went on.\n\nOn the plus side, I very much enjoyed the 'power set' of this new hero, and whilst there are a few typos the game is fairly well written, but let's cut out all of the gender fluid/ gender neutral bs.","April 10","false","3.5"," 21 of 26 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","21","26","0","0"

For everyone else, wait til the next one.\n\nEDIT: The reason why I say all this, is because I like the old heroes rise stories, and I want the author to improve.

The long playtime is indicative of how long it took me to commit to completing a single playthrough of it. I had the same issue with the author’s last game, Versus where I was just not able to finish it in a timely fashion, because I had similar issues that I did to this one. Left on in the background as I attended to other things, because I wasn’t interested in anything it was saying. It took most of the issues of that game, and accentuated them.\n\nThe game centred far too heavily on the idea of discrimination, and attempted to work it into a laboured analogy for minorities today. It’s nice to have some sort of message in it, but it interferes completely with any aspect of escapism involved.\n\nIn that sense, I was never allowed to feel like a super hero, which certainly was not the case with the Heroes Rise Trilogy. That series had a focus on what you wanted to do with the powers, and how you shaped your own morality, and made your own choices to shape the story around you. Here I felt bent to the will of the person writing it, being constantly reminded of their morality that they intended to preach, rather than taking any opinion I had on a situation and implementing it. The only “underhanded” thing I was able to do was make an elimination vote for some character I had no reason to save, and even that seemed to only exist so I could be made continuously feel bad for doing so.\n\nMy options tended to range from whether I felt strongly about underrepresentation, to whether I felt very, very strongly about underrepresentation. And I suppose that isn’t what I wanted the game to be about. At the end it tries to make me feel bad about a death that I only tried to prevent, while guilting me for helping heal my dying sister instead of worrying about said underrepresentation (especially when I was supposed to make a choice at the expense of her well being that was ignored at the end.)\n\nThe whole animal shape shifting and all was its own issue as well, where now I’m being implored to guilt people for forming any kind of impression about whatever animal form my character woke up in that day. It’s a silly plot device as it is, and along with taking me out of connecting with the character I’m supposed to be creating, it further removes me from the connection I’m supposed to be feeling with the story, which is already tenuous at best.\n\nCharacters within the game were given little chance to showcase what they were really about, both within the context of limited screen time, and doing nothing with said screen time. Everyone simply passes by or dies before they make any impression. And it feels like they’re not supposed to, because the game isn’t about any of them, or characters in general.\n\nMy ultimate summary of this game is that it feels less like I’m choosing my own adventure, and more like I’m being told how I’m supposed to observe an adventure that was dictated in full before I began it. I would hope that it changes pace with a sequel, but considering the singular direction in which this story was written, and the manner in which this author’s style is continuing to change, I feel like it would likely get worse.\n","April 27","false","47.1"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","11","15","0","0"

We're told (quite often) about the various trials that marginalized hero types face, but rarely see it in practice.  It's definitely part of the background, but for the most part, you're simply told that "X circumstance exists, and needs to change" without much in the way of showcasing it.  That said, I honestly found it LESS jarring than an instance in "Heroes Rise: The Hero Project" where a discussion of "camp" completely derailed things for a few pages before returning to action as normal, and that's likely because it's a central story-arc this time around.\n\nThat said, this seems to be playing up an X-Men vs. Brotherhood of Mutants deal regarding your character, who's an "ani-powered" (think Beast Boy, but with no semblance of control over what form he takes each day), though there's no payoff in this particular game for it.  Like the original series, odds are this one is going to be setting up a few factors in order to include them later.\n\nOverall, worth playing the Demo - if you like it at that point, feel free to buy (if it gets too preachy, you shouldn't have enough time invested to void the Refund option), and if you don't, you can save yourself the time/money.

I enjoyed the first trilogy, and I like Redemption Season so far as well. I want to encourage the writers and developers to keep on 'keepin' on' with this series.\n\nPros:\n\nI enjoy the fact that you can carry over your character choices from game to game, and I like the fact that you can see the results of the first trilogy's events played out in Redemption.\n\nI like the stat system and mechanics as well as the fact you don't have to grind stats as you do in some novel-style games.\n\nThe plot and setting are engaging, and the concept sparks my interest.\n\nI picked up a Danielle Steele novel the other day and found it remarkably boring compared to the action-packed writing you have here, which could either be a testiment to the game's good writing or a reflection of my own warped taste.\n\nThe concept behind the reader's character (their powers and background story) is interesting for me.\n\nI am a long-time fan of choose your own adventure stories. I like being in control of the story's direction. Plus, it's like getting a bunch of different books all in one package.\n\nI am pleased to see that the reality show producers are evolving as characters as well and have bigger goals, nobler purpose and more of a vision for the show than just to get the biggest ratings for the bang, so to speak. (I also like to see their failures and backfires and how they are learning from them.)\n\nEven though I'm a pretty straight shooter when it comes to my romances, I like to see that this game has options, and a ton of them, for whatever orientation floats your boat.\n\nCons:\n\nIt's tough that you can't save and need to take the consequences of your choices (or accidental clicks) or start over, especially for someone like me who ends up duffing romance options because I'd rather save the world and succeed my way without compromising to accomodate the demands of a potential dating prospect. (Hope I didn't ruin my chances with Weaver because I voted one of his contestants off.)\n\nThere is a some heavy-handed material in this novel about social inequalities, discrimination and activism. Folks who like to read fantasy/sci fi to get away from politics may want to steer clear. I don't mind it too much. Sometimes it gets a little 'in your face', but there are some good questions and points raised by the characters about these issues that could reflect on the issues of today. I would hate to see this trilogy evolve into a social studies lesson about human rights however. My preference is to keep those issues relevant, but not overshadowing the heroic adventures of the protagonist him/her/hir self. If the foreshadowing is any indication, however, it looks like the story may shift its focus soon anyhow.\n\nNeither good nor bad:\n\nThis series, as the trilogy before it, forces you to make tough choices. There were times where I just couldn't decide what to do and had to leave the game for a while to think about it  before coming back with my decision. The consequences can be dramatic to the story and there's no going back except to start over, and I'm too cheap to spring for the hint MeChip thingy.  I like stories that make you think. It drives me bonkers when the consequences take the story in a direction I sincerely wish it hadn't, or come up with an ending I find disappointing because I made that one choice way back 25 choices ago.\n\nOverall, I liked it, though. I like the characters. Some are flat and predictable, but some have unexpected surprises and layers of depth you weren't expecting until you choose to get to know them. It makes me want to use whatever system/software they're using to create my own adventures.  The game itself is not that expensive, but I waited until it went on sale on Steam and picked it up. It cost a heck of a lot less than a book at the bookstore, and I feel I definitely got my money's worth. So thanks, creators and writers! Please continue to improve your stories and enhance your writing style. I, for one, want to see what happens next.","May 5","true","9.8"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

It's wonderful to be able to go back in time to the days of reading through a CYOA book as a kid.\n\nThe Heroes Rise trilogy of games followed your own individual character who you coould customise with a few options such as gender, sexual orientation, codename, powers, etc. Throughout each game, you'd be faced with choices, some critical and some not so much, which would further tailor your character in terms of their sense of justice, their morals and their opinions on how powered individuals fit in society at large. It was a great story told over three games and there was a real sense of being a small cog in a big machine as other characters in this world evolved alongside you throughout the three games. In short, you should definitely go and play those three games before playing this one.\n\nIf you have played the Heroes Rise trilogy, you can choose to carry your save data over to this game (though I did encounter a very annoying bug which meant I had to play through the whole of the last game again to make a fresh save which could be uploaded) which means that even though you're playing as an entirely new character, you'll get to encounter some fun little callbacks and some additional worldbuilding, courtesy of the choices you made in the HR trilogy.\n\nBut what about this game? The Hero Project (THP from now on) has you once again take on the role of a customisable super hero who, in short, is tasked with saving their sister's life. It's a classic story made much more interesting by placing your character in a reality show environment. I got some real Hunger Games vibes from mingling with my fellow contestants and delivering interviews with my answers playing a role in whether or not I'd be going home or advancing to the next stage and it's this which is my main issue with this game. Although THP is a CYOA game and the choices, big and small, do indeed carry weight throughout the game it is pretty clear that the writer wants you to follow a set path. There is a theme running throughout the game of the oppression of the downtrodden and how as a member of the downtrodden, you could take it upon yourself to use your new reality show platform to reveal the true plight of your kind or, in theory, you can ignore this agenda and focus on helping your sister. Only you can't. Maybe I've not made the right choices but I was greeted by three game over screens (you can imagine my frustration after spending around an hour combing through the text and deliberating over my choices that I was told I'd failed and could either restart the whole game or sacrifice my legend score (a stat which tracks your hero's fame/notoriety) to go back a few choices and try again. No checkpoints, no save state.) after trying to pick three different sets of choices which followed the beliefs I wanted my character to have (a straight-talking, private person with a soft spot for her sister. Her only motivation for going along with the contest being to help her however she could. She had no particular interest in any political message and was just there for family). On my fourth go at it, I decided to have my hero take a much more vocal approach to her thoughts on the political landscape just for the sake of trying to get past this one part and was rewarded by being allowed to progress through the game. I can only wonder why the option to not have a particularly strong opinion on the plight of 'ani-powered' heroes was included if you can't actually progress through the game by going down this route.\n\nAlthough this decision by the writer has soured my opinion on this game, I still recommend it. At least to those familiar with the series. THP is a nice spin-off to the main HR series and it's pretty neat seeing decisions you made there coming back in some form here. The writing is great, characters are varied and memorable (JK is truly endearing) and this game will keep you hooked if you're a fan of the source material. If you're looking at this game and think it might be for you but haven't had the chance to play any of the other three then I highly recommend you look at those first.\n\nPros -\n- Customisation. Name, codename, gender, sexual orientation, costume, sense of justice and more. Though do bear in mind that most of your potential enjoyment from this feature will come from your imagination. You can't choose your character's appearance or even something as basic as the colour of their hair but to me at least, that wasn't an issue.\n- The ability to upload your save data from the main HR series (though this game will only take a completed save from the final part of the trilogy).\n- An engaging story with twists and turns and memorable characters. JK, Weaver and a certain blast from the past definitely helped convince me to recommend this game.\n- Some truly creative super powers.\n- All of your stats are kept in one easy to find place where they can be readily referenced at any time.\n\nNeutral -\n- This is a text-only, CYOA game. There are no images and your enjoyment of this game will derive entirely from how much you enjoy reading and using your imagination.\n\n\nCons -\n- Some illusion of choice.\n- Hidden stats that affect whether you'll be able to progress through the game, get to try again at the cost of a huge chunk of your character's fame score or have to restart entirely from scratch resulting in you having to click through a bunch of text you've already read and typing in names that you've already written.\n- Personally, I wasn't a fan of the main character's superpower.\n\n///SPOILER/// You get to harness the abilities of a different animal every day. And also their appearance. You literally spend some of the game as a chicken man/woman. And as a wheelchair bound bumblebee person. ///SPOILER///\n\nIn summary, THP makes for some nice worldbuilding in the thoroughly enjoyable universe of Heroes Rise. If you've played that trilogy or will be playing it in preparation for playing this game then you're going to enjoy THP a lot more than you would if this was your first taste of the series. £2.09 (until April 15th) for a very well written book that you can influence the outcome of is a very good deal indeed. Just give the main series a look first.","April 8","true","5.0"," 25 of 47 people (53%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","53","25","47","0","0"

I dont usually write reviews but the negative reviews below made me want to offer a different perspective. The majority of the negative reviews only critisize the existance of marginalised groups being portrayed positively and an apparent "social justice" agenda. I don't know what they thought was going on when reading the original trilogy, but there has always been an anti-discrimination "agenda" in Heroes Rise. And I love it.\n\nFrom the moment GG mentioned a Season 2 of THP, I wondered what would happen next. If you HAVE played the first three in this series, you know that the protaganist of those games fight against prejudice as an Infini Powered hero. I finished the trilogy having managed to bring "anti-powered sentiment" to an all time low and honestly felt a real sense of pride.\n\nThats what I like to see in fiction. Stories that make me FEEL.\n\nThe Hero Project: Redeption Season takes this to a new level. We saw in the Heroes Rise trilogy that there were many AniPowered heroes and villains who were vindicated for who they were. Most of them were the villains in this story. This is the first time we get to see from the other side. The first time you can REALY sympathise with what they go through. Before we only saw AniPowered through an outsiders eye. This time we get to experience what its like. We may not actually experience the painful transformations that our protaganist does, but their experiences are what drives this story.\n\nAdditionally, like the Heroes Rise trilogy, the LGBT+ representation is outstanding. There are multiple characters who exist outside the gednder binary, possibly including you. You are able to play as male, female, intersex, or non-gender conforming, as well as specifying being a transwoman or transman.","April 20","true","3.4"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"

It's kind of saddening really, there isn't even like, any comedy from this. Wasted opportunity.\n- The political message in this is hamfisted. EVERY opportunity it gets, it slaps you with it, to the point where I have to say: If you want to put your own political message into your game, that's fine. The error here is that you let the message, BECOME the game. It's painful to see this series adopt this as a main theme, when in the previous games these themes were a side-plot, where they belonged.\n- Some of the characters are rather.. Uninteresting and kind of tacky, however that might be because I haven't really interacted with them enough.\n\n-- CONCLUSION --\nOverall I recommend this game with a caution: The author clearly has some kind of fascination at the moment with Equal Rights and has let this become the main theme of the game. If you are someone who doesn't want to get wrapped up in this kind of political conversing, perhaps you'd be better off finding a better game. I'd personally recommend the original trilogy if you still want to play any of the Hero games.\n\nMaybe it's becuase I deal with daily job-rejections becuase of my disabilities and my mental health issues, but a game where I'm constantly reminded that sometimes society treats you like ♥♥♥♥, kind of isn't all that fun.\nThe sibling moments are brilliant and JK is genuinely interesting, but from what I've played so far it's kind of just the author shouting "TREATING PEOPLE DIFFERENTLY BASED ON THEIR LOOKS IS BAD!", which really?

But this new book just added a new sense of urgency in a lot of aspects in our society, from the individual unit outwards. It tackled issues on psychologoical behaviour of individuals and the ever-present discrimination of people of different nationalities and ethnicities(politically and sociologically correct term for races when referring to humans). I can relate to Zachary Sergi much more deeply now that I have read the four books of his Heroes Rise universe. To tell the truth, I only played these games just to pass time, but then I got so hooked up in all the representations of human society packed together with fantastical plots and characters. I have to admit, even though I have my own set of ideals and beliefs, Zachary Sergi ended up reenforcing these ideals and renewing my perception of society and my morals as an individual. As a social science student, I can understand and appreciate the scenarios presented to the player with each choice he makes. These may be a few of the many novels and books that actually tackle social issues with clear stands and clear support for ideals. I higly recommend reading this series for those who feel there is something wrong, inappropriate or missing in our current culture.

Heroes is a trilogy is this is made off the best part of the trilogy, Hero Project, a super hero reality show. Obviously comparison will be made regardless of necessity. So between first Hero Project and Redemption, I choose first because it was way refreshing sequel to the first part. But between the first trilogy and Redemption, I choose this because the stats are way better refined and it is not hard to grasp.\n\nStory is good and intriguing especially temptations to change side. If it materializes, it would be good. I did like the dynamic with sick jelly sibling. Obviously sequels are being set up but somehow the story seems more linear than the trilogy which seems unsettling, hopefully I am wrong. Also when MC connects the dot about what a certain psychic told to do and the reason behind it, seems a like a plot hole big as The Falls itself. I could have missed something but when I read it, I was stumped and clueless how the MC made head and toes of something like that. Plus no further explaination made, bugs me more.\n\nTalking about bugs, first I could not transfer my Hero Fall saves to Redemption. I had to play through again which was annoying. What was more annoying is the fact I bought my warning DLC yet unable to use cause of bug.

Your gender identity (cis, trans, intersex, or agender), sexuality (straight, gay, bi/pan, ace), ideals, motives, actions, and it all seems incredibly deep.\n\nIt far exceeds any of the other games put out by Zachary Sergei (the Heroes Rise trilogy, and Versus: The Lost Ones), and it completely blows all of the other Choice of Games out of the water.

A world where race and sexuality issues are just magically "solved" was unrealistic to the point of being dumb as far as I was concerned. Now I see this wasn't a cheap attempt to sidestep a serious issue (and miss out on characterization opportunities) it was more a way of communicating in a way that wouldn't immediately put a lot of people's guard up.\n\nOf course It didn't really work; plenty of people still complain about this being preachy but those people complain about preachiness when dealing with other people in real life who have unfamiliar problems. One way or the other you can't make people listen if they don't want to. So I applaud the author's attempt here to sneak in some higher level thinking but, no dice.\n\nAnalyzing this experience purely as a game/piece of writing I thought it was pretty damn good 8/10.

I've been a big fan of the Hero Rise games even before they ended up on steam and I think Zachary is one of the most gifted writers I've ever come across. However if you are looking for an adventure similar to the Hero Rise trilogy, you'll probably be a bit disappointed.\n\nRedemption Season I feel is more a game that'd be enjoyed by tumblr activist or SJWs than anyone else (nothing wrong with that). The plot of the story is that you're entering the Hero Project as a underprivileged, underrepresented, minority figure who's trying to help his disabled sister get medical treatments and focuses a lot more on discrimination and activism than it does you being a superhero. The game REALLY hammers in the themes and ideology of systematic oppression so if you're not really passionate about those kinds of politics, you'll probably have a few eye roll moments especially due to how frequently they come up in conversation. Personally I don’t think it’d be as bad if the story showed a bit more of how people thought less of your character’s traits rather than have the characters say that’s how people view them. To it's credit though it never got to the point where I was annoyed enough to stop playing and I did feel like it was written with the awareness that these kinds of issues aren't as black and white as calling people names and shouting at the top of your lungs. Also part of what I think makes Zachary such a great writer is that there is an extremely high amount of diverse well written characters ranging from different genders, sexual attractions, race, body type, and beyond. Even if I didn't like this game as much as I'd want to, I do think there needs to be more games and media with this kind of diversity. The game can be addictive even if you're not the biggest fan of hearing this kind of stuff constantly on loop  but overall you'll probably love it 100% more than me if you are a big fan of these kinds of issues.\n\nCompared to the original trilogy, it does takes some risks in it's formula and I can't fault it for that even if there are some things I didn't like. For example, I didn't like how occasionally you'd switch perspectives to different characters. I understand that it really helped the story flow a lot smoother but I felt like it took me out of the experience of role-playing as MY character and it felt like the choices I was making as these characters didn't have any real weight to them or that they were done to cheat and make the game easier for my character (such as choosing to give myself more legend points). Again though, it is a very well-written story and it'd be hard to get those perspectives otherwise so it's not really a loss. Other than that, maybe it's just that I haven't played the other games in a while and are now better at these, but I felt like this one was easier than the last ones and the tone of "better watch your step" wasn't as impending.  The biggest difference though is unlike the first few games where the atmosphere was all about the new underdog hero with high hopes learning to find his way in adolescents while having impossible odds stacked against him at every turn and overall teaching the lesson of what it means to be imperfect and live with your decisions, I felt this one was more about the underdog who’s forced to be a statistic and advocates for equality and learns things aren’t always so simple or black and white. Both are good, but I prefer the first more because it isn’t a lesson I see very often and I already know to treat people fairly.\n\n\nOverall It's very preachy at the beginning and midway points of the game but eventually it does dies down after a while and become more of the same spirit that I loved from the first series. If you're someone who is interested in human rights issues and superheros, I'd highly recommend this game because you'll have a blast. If you’re not, it isn’t a bad game by any means but you probably will have to get used to it or pass completely.\n\nI'd give it a 6.5 out 10\n\nIt was good enough that'll I'll probably play the next installment when it comes out but not so much that I'm dying to know what happens.\n\nSide Note; it was great to see how everything in Hero Rise tied into this game. I especially love the MeChip XD","April 12","true","22.0"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

I found the story being told to be pretty interesting, though the interludes were a bit odd and made the whole story seem a bit more disjointed. I think my biggest issue with it though was simply that it cut off too soon. I am certainly looking forward to seeing what will hapen in the next installment though.\n\nAnd I do have to say, getting to see my Heroes Rise hero and so many other characters I came to really love return to the story was a very satisfying experience.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SRVAL/recommended/459310/","SRVAL","VAL","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SRVAL/","80 products in account","The Hero Project: Redemption Season is a text based RPG in which your decisions affect the story.\n\nI have not played the original Hero Project trilogy so this would be my introduction into the world.\n\nAlthough the basis for the story is very promising and engaging, it more than occasionally suffers from ham-fisted writing that detracts from immersion. You play as a character of chosen gender and sexuality whose physiology mimics an animal and morphs on a daily basis. You use this power to enter the Hero Project on the agreement that, by succeeding, your sister will be healed.\n\nAlong the way you are introduced to power based inequality and group targeted hate crimes against those people who have more 'unsavory' powers. The game opens a wide conversation into inequality and the treatment of marginalized groups. However, the story falls into pits of monologues that stray from the focus of the story and seem to try to educate the reader on societal issues.\n\nOverall, this is an enjoyable game if you can overlook the jump in the focus of storytelling every now and then. I feel that the reason this game has mixed reviews is because of this and it's a shame because beneath it is an enjoyable story with interesting and memorable characters.\n\n7/10","April 21","true","6.2"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

Fair warning, while the story itself is good then the author hamfists the political message way too much. At times you may feel like you are reading some SJW manifesto and it is not pretty. All love to ya Zach, but give it a rest. Instead of adding to a compelling story it starts to detract from it and worse starts to make the world seem more unreal than sluggin superpowers do. Please for the next one dial down the hamfisting and make this series great again.

Of course, this ties with political ideas of this society, and how YOUR character fits into all this, if you believe you should be changing the views of society, or merely filling the stereotype.\n\nGame-play:\n\nThis game is definitely (In my opinion), a good succession to the Heroes Rise trilogy, as I like the authors direction with this new series, bringing up political ideas and allowing your character to follow you ideals in believing their should be change within this society. I can see why people can play this and see this as 'off putting', but honestly it brought depth to this already good game.\n\nStory:\n\nThe story isn't anything ground-breaking, as it is essentially the second season of "The Hero Project," with a new cast of unique characters, with a variety of super powers. #lovethereferences, #lookingforwardtopart2. Although from the first series, this time around it felt more genuine and more like a story with the changed perspectives to show the player other personal conversations that effect the players character, without spoiling the story to the player. This addition I really enjoyed, as it felt more personal to me to understand another characters circumstances, that effect my choices, rather than making them feel two dimensional characters.\n\nMark: 8.8/10 Amazing.\n\nTraditionally for Choice of Games, the main verdict comes down to the games story, and for Heroes Rise Redemption Season, it is certainly a game series not to be overlook. I was a huge fan of the first series, and I was sceptical of the second series not standing up to its predecessor, but after purchasing this game and experiencing it for myself, I was immediately re-hooked back onto this new series, as the mature concepts are really what makes this games story exceptional, as traditionally what hero story's lack in comparison is to delve into darker concepts, Zachary Sergi however, does not overlook this feature. For anyone who is sceptical about if this game is worth purchasing, the answer is 100% yes, as this is a fantastic continuation of the previous series, as I will definitely be going back to this game and playing through the different outcomes, and seeing different parts of the story.\n\nNote for Author:\n\nThanks Zach for continuing this series its been one of my favourite Choice of Games to experience, take your time with the next one, I'm really looking forward to it, and where the story is going.\n\nSide Note:\n\nWhen the MC's Me-Chip was introduced my first thought was "It's gonna be a good day."","April 9","true","6.5"," 4 of 12 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","4","12","0","0"

With anime, and cartoons, and good scifi, and comic book movies. And it all bleeds in to be something I look forward to more then any AAA game. The story is the oldest thing humans love to share, and it forms the core of much of our culture and being. So it delights me that the stories coming from this author and many like them are starting to reflect all the changes and interesting new developments our world has gone through.
