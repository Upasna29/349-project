I backed it on Kickstarter, I enjoy the tabletop version and turn-based squad-based combat is one of my favourite genres. Unfortunately, it's not very good. Not truly horrible, but not good.\n\nThe camera has improved with patches, but it's still wonky. Many battlefields have tall structures messing up the camera and you can't zoom far enough out to get a good view. This is one of the main problems with the game.\nThe UI takes up too much space. Gets worse because of the camera issues.\nThe character selection process is not intuitive and not very responsive, mostly a problem when units activate out of turn.\nThe rules are neither transparent enough nor a direct translation of the boardgame. That makes playing the game a tad more confusing than necessary, though it's not a really big deal.\nThe developers went with a square grid movement system for no fathomable reason, when there are hexes available. Not a big deal at all, but it annoys me.\nThe AI is stupid. Single-player skirmishes are only worth it as practice runs.\nI have severe CTD-troubles. If you're lucky, this is not a problem. For me, the game is not currently playable because of this combined with the next problem... [edit: I have conquered the CTD menace by setting graphics to the lowest setting possible. It works, but you can scratch the below comment about graphics -it has to look like Minecraft if I want to play.] [edit 2: Oh, it's back. Even on lowest settings.]\nYOU CAN'T SKIP CUTSCENES! This is unforgivable in any game. [edit: diligent research shows that you can, indeed, partially skip most cutscenes but it's not good enough and the fact that I had to be told on this forum how to do it doesn't help. "Enter" key, if you need to know. Not "Esc", oh no.]\nEdit 2: I still haven't figured out how to save during campaign battles, pretty sure it's impossible. For a game with CTD issues and where battles can easily take an hour, this is a problem.\n\nThere are good things too: The game looks and feels good, the single-player storyline is OK, there are frequent patches to solve known issues. Unfortunately, it's just not good enough.\n\nIf you don't suffer from CTDs it should be OK, but there are better games out there to spend your precious time on. Try it if you like the setting and get it for cheap.\n\n[Edited because I take my reviews very seriously and listen to constructive criticism.]","January 3, 2015","false","34.7"," 367 of 414 people (89%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","89","367","414","14","11"

I was perfectly fine with that, they were trying to get the game fully released so all its kickstarter backers could enjoy what they paid for.\n\nUnfortunately, the game ended up feeling hacked together when it was officially "released".\n\nThe single player campaign, although it was enjoyable to be given different scenerios to overcome, there were just a lot of things wrong with it. The camera was, and still is pretty unbarable, the UI would not always play nice with the map you were on, and the AI was not very challenging and followed a very specific sequence of moves unless you put a target right in their face.\n\nThe cutscenes were something out of a launch Playstation 1 game. Completely still models with the camera panning to whoever was talking, and even then you had a hard time seeing who it was because of the lighting. With how much work that was put into the in game models, you think they could have animated the scenes. That said, the in game models are pretty nice, fans of the table top will appreciate how the characters and warjacks look animated.\n\nThe multiplayer was meant to be the bread and butter for this game, a way for people who enjoy the table top, or even new comers, to come press a button and be put into a game of warmachine instantly. The multiplayer feels like its lacking A LOT. Yes you can be matched with another player, most of the time. It is not uncommon for the "quick match" option, to not be quick at all. The multiplayer as a game functions, bugs excluded, but it not very enjoyable because of the problems the overall game has, as well as very simple win conditions.\n\nThe UI is just awful. Actions feel unresponsive, it is arranged in an unappealing matter, text can be hard to read, and it difficult to traverse the playing map. Getting information to appear on your spells and abilities usually requires you to click the button for it, thus committing to the action.\n\nThe grid system is also not executed as well as it could have. It feels clunky and sometimes even inconsistent.\n\nWhat is worse about knowing all these things is the price tag that has been on it. The DLC model is also kind of a turn off, especially in the state the game is still in. If the game were in a relatively bugg free state, charging DLC is reasonable.\n\nDeveloping the DLC seemed to be as high, or perhaps an even higher priority than making the game as functional as it could be.\n\nTLDR: Game is no where near as functional as it should be. UI is unbarable, camera is wonky, gameplay is not strong enough to hold it all up. DLC seems to take a place above fixing bugs and improving overall functionality.","June 29, 2015","false","41.7"," 137 of 156 people (88%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","88","137","156","9","1"

Just to be clear, I do not think the early access is worth the extra money. The UI is unfinished which makes it frustrating to move warrior models around (and the lack of Units in the game makes moving 11 Mechanithralls "solos" a very time consuming process), game breaking bugs abound such as certain knockdown effects not affecting large base targets, some spells are listed on the UI but are not in the game yet, 20 FPS is about the max anyone can seem to get despite current gen computer hardware, and it is generally a painful rather than fun experience at the moment. I will happily create another review when the game is done, but as it stands I cannot recommend this purchase.\n\nOne thing I can say about the game in its beta state that will carry over to the final product is that this is *NOT* a clone of the tabletop game. Many spell effects and abilities differ, major effects like Disruption do not function the same, point costs have been changed since everything is now a solo, Warjack systems have been removed entirely so a jack with one box left functions just as well as a jack with 20 boxes, everything rolls three dice for attack and damage, and everything is grid based with an always-visible grid (read: pre-measuring). The devs have listed a full list of changes in the forums: http://steamcommunity.com/app/253510 These changes may appeal to you or they may frustrate you, just don't buy this game thinking you will be getting the same experience as the tabletop.","July 9, 2014","false","17.2"," 1,298 of 1,759 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","298","1","0","21"

Actions were clunky at times, sure, whatever, I can deal. Units performed completely randomly at times, that was anoying, but in keeping with the tabletop to PC feel of the thing. Not a AAA title, but it never claimed to be. It was building up to a decent game, pieces at a time. There were annoying parts fixed, like global spells lens flare-ing the screen un-playable for a small buff, that were fixed. Generally it looked like a nice game without the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ish nature of some people who shall not be na-*cough*EA*cough*-med.\n\nThen a funny thing happened with the Mercenaries faction. It was originally availiable to play with the standard game. Then it was shoved ceremoniously behind a DLC paywall. Same with the Retribution. And there's so much of it. For the price of the DLC and the game itself, I can put together two, maybe three physical armies on the cheap. Anyone who knows about how expensive miniature wargames are, knows that this is ridiculous.\n\nThis could have been a nice cheap entry point to the physical game for some, but it's not anymore. Could have been a nice turn based strategy for others, but with two of the factions locked out of the multiplayer and a bluh campaign, it's not. It could have had a great story for the Iron Kingdoms, a setting oozing with so much badass flowing through it's rivers that even the goblins wear shades and walk calmly away from explosions, but it wasn't. Not the worst story, but could have been better.\n\nSorry, and this saddens me to say, but I cannot reccomend this game.\n\ntldr; Don't buy it, DLC is too much for too little, doesn't do enough with what it has.","October 19, 2015","false","9.5"," 150 of 176 people (85%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","85","150","176","6","1"

Unless you already know all the terms and what each unit looks like you won't know what you are doing.\n-Many Textures aren't crisp even on highest game settings\n-Cinematic scenes are just models frozen in position.  The camera pans around and there is voice over but that is it.\n-The UI, all of it...\n-Buggy cursor registration\n-Completion of unit action phases is buggy, sometimes not completing properly and other times getting extra "outside of action activity"\n-Tiny mini-map with no configuration.\n-Whenever voice-over text or instructions are displayed, all UI elements are disabled\n-You cannot return to menu during a cinematic, you can quit the game though.\n\n\n---\nI have friends who play the tabletop version and I was interested but didn't have the time or money to get into it.  That said, they were excited about it so I backed the kickstarter for this game.\n\nI finally ended up getting my Steam key last week because I noticed the game was on sale and I still hadn't even gotten my backer key yet.  The turnaround was fairly fast from contacting them to getting my key but I still wasn't impressed that I never got a notice or key when the game was released in the first place.\n\n--- Update:\n\nI wasn't able to get powers and abilities hover information to work previously, even waiting 15 seconds while hovering over different areas.  I was able to get these to work today after Eyl's comment stating that they were working for him.  My problem last time could have been related to crash issues and forced process termination.  The problem still remains though that there is no visual differentiation between what are section names, weapon names, abilities, special abilities.  It is all in list format with no standard in font sizing or type.\n\nFor example:\n\nWeapon name has a smaller font size than weapon damage/range information.  Weapon damage/range information is the same font size as the "Melee Weapons" or "Ranged Weapons" headings.  Shadowing on the fonts is random and appears to be a problem with it not being toggled on/off properly as it isnt standard across units or even in ability listings on a single unit.\n\n\nEven if that was fixed right now the game still wouldnt be worth the $40 price tag.  If they fixed all of the ui issues, cursor registration, buggy animations ( units turn backwards and then forwards upon completion of a move action ), and put actual cinematics or even comic style cinematics into the game I would consider looking at it again.

The game is better, prettier, and more stable than ever before. It still might not be for everybody, but it's worth a look.\n\nLong version:\nI've been playing since Early Access, but wanted to wait until the last of the Kickstarter DLC was released before writing a review. In the meantime, I've watched a nearly unplayably buggy game get lots of fixes and polish from the developers, and now I feel like it would be fair to give it a balanced review. APRIL 25, 2015\n\nPROS:\n+Excellent character models and animations fully capture the look and feel of the Iron Kingdoms setting.\n+Very deep core gameplay draws many concepts faithfully from its table top origins.\n+Single player story is decent, written by game creator Matt Wilson, and has some fun missions.\n+Each faction is very distinct, and has a good (not great) variety of models.\n+Multiplayer is fun and intense. I've only dabbled, but I could get hooked.\n+SP Skirmish mode is okay for testing teams or admiring art assets.\n+Highly active and invovled development team communicates regularly with players.\n\nMinor Drawbacks:\n* Some spell and engine effects are too shiny/intense for my taste.\n* The balance between troops and warjacks has shifted quite a bit in favour of the former. Feels different from tabletop.\n* No Man's Land single-player campaign leaves out two of the factions almost completely (3 if you count Mercs).\n* Limited unit selection in early matches means not as much replay value for single player campaign.\n* The user interface has been improving, but it takes up a lot of screen, and isn't the prettiest.\n* Some of my favourite units aren't out yet, and I know I'll have to pay for them as DLC someday.\n* Controls and camera are better than ever, but still take getting used to.\n* There isn't a large enough player base to guarantee fast MP matchmaking yet.\n\nMajor CONS:\n- Core game features are not yet implemented\n(no Hotseat, no Asynchronous MP, no painter, and only stupid-easy Skirmish difficulty)\n- Single-player campaign has bad AI, and compensates with waves of suicidal dummies.\n- Certain graphics configurations caused the game to crash frequently. I'm good now, but it was unplayable at times.\n\nI recommend this game more than I ever could have before, especially to people who tried an early build and gave up because of the bugs and lack of polish. It is very playable, very fun, and worth coming back to.  For new players, I would recommend it if you are a fan of the Warmachine universe, or if you like skirmish tactics games.

This is not entirely the actress's fault, though she doesn't help with an odd accent on her voice that comes and goes. She has very little to work with as the dialogue she has been given is terrible. As the major character of the Cygnar campaign, she is kind of important, but sadly she is probably the worst of all the early game characters. This is pretty bad considering none of them have particualrly good dialogue, they just did an even more terrible job with her.\n\nMusic is inoffensive, though entirely forgettable. I'd suggest just switching it off and playing some of your own instead.\n\nGraphics are competent, though no more than that. Farly standard and won't blow your mind. Though there are ridiculous things like, why the hell are the character portraits of such low res terribad quality? It would literrally be a 10x improvement if they just took a screenshot of a characters face in game instead. It is mystifying to me.\n\nAnimation is weak. Most of the basic movement is fine, though jumping onto and over obstacles is very stilted, particularly the transition from being infront of the obstascle to interacting with it, it just looks weird. Death animations regularly bug out, so instead of a rag-doll of a corpse, you get a weird pixellated spasm of colour and then the body is on the ground. Melee combat animations are generally stilted and way too slow, there is also too much disconnect between the impact and the effect on the target, making it look rather silly when a character gently waves their sword in the direction of an enemy and after a very noticeable pause, the enemy flies backwards as though they have been hit with considerable force.\n\nCamer work is sloppy. It generally works acceptable well for navigating the map and issuing orders. But as soon as the game seizes control of the camera, which it does to zoom in on combat and other events, it all goes wrong. If there is a piece of terrain available for the camera to hide behind, it will find it. I believe at least 50% of fights I have 'watched' from behind a wall, or tree or other terrain feature. If you aren't going to bother to put the effort in to handle camera zoom properly, there is really no reason to do it at all. Currently they have made a net negative impact to the game with this, rather than just leaving it out.\n\nThere are also a number of bugs remaining in the game, that seem to randomly block you from issuing context sensitive orders to your troops, for example not being able to issue melee attack command during melee combat, instead having to walk out of combat and shoot the enemy. If I was not familiar with Warmachine from playing the tabletop game, I may have thought some of these bugs were my misunderstanding of the rules and therefore not realised they were bugs. That they still exist is an example of the lack of polish that remains in thsi game.\n\nGameplay is largely competent although the AI is non-existent (more later), but does not flow well. There are numerous little ♥♥♥♥ly (n i g g l y) issues that do not work properly. For example facing, it seems to be half random as to which direction you end up facing after moving. If you move, you'd expect your finaly facing to correspond to the general direction you moved in, but this is not always the case, you could instead end up facing either left or right of the direction of movement, a fairly minor point, as you can adjust facing after moving, but as you have to do this for all your units it quickly gets tiresome. This is clearly an issue in the programming of the game, as the enemy always ends up facing the wrong way after moving as well, and has to re-orientate, adding more waiting time during the enemy turn. Which is another fairly major issue. There is no way to skip animating the entire enemy turn. This is not a problem when playing a human, as you actually want to see what they are doing so you can react, but the computer will never do anything even slightly unexpected, it is easy to predict the exact position of all enemy units 4-5 turns in advance and there is never any doubt in exactly what their response will be, namely headlong charge into primary weapon range and attack, as soon as you get within the scripted spotting distance.\n\nSeveral missions into the single player campaign and I have yet to find any evidence of any independent AI activity whatsoever. All enemy activity is scripted to such a predictable degree it is ridiculous. Basically like this. Either the enemy will remain entirely passive until you are within a pretty close proximity and then rush to attack the nearest unit with his primary weapon, or you are fighting a wave assault and the enemy will rush you in waves from maximum range. There is no attempt to perform coordinated assaults or flank you or any other slightly more complicated manouvers.\n\nAs a re-creation of the tabletop game, sadly this fails badly. Weapon ranges are stupidly short, warjacks retain full capability until destroyed, to name but two glaringly obvious fails.\n\nOverall, Warmachine is a fairly competent game, but it is obvious that the team at White Moon Dreams are very inexperienced, with possibly a couple of experienced developers/managers among them who have failed to sufficiently spread their expertise to avoid rookie mistakes. Without knowing the details behind the contract, it is impossible to know where the blame for this failure to hire sufficient experienced staff lies, but it has clearly impacted the quality and polish of this game.\n\nIf this review seems very negative, it is because it is my first impressions, and it was the bad points that stood out. The aspects I've skipped over or not mentioned were pretty much competent, but not particularly worthy of praise for being outstanding or notable either.\n\nI would still not recommend this game, though it is a huige improvement on when I last played it. The price is still a bit too hgh for the technical quality of the game. Once the price drops to about £15 I may reconsider the value for money. The main fault of this fail lies squarely with Privateer Press management, their decision to pass this project to White Moon Dreams. A totally inexperienced studio who have clearly done their best, but made all the standard rookie mistakes and clearly have no experience to make a decent AI. Which even experienced studios regularly fail at (Hi CA and Total War). I don't know if this was done to retain more creative control, or to cut corners and milk the IP... sorry, for budgetary reasons (like Privateer Press are short of a bob or two), but it has resulted in a dissapointingly substandard experience, which will probably end up costing PP more in lost revenue.\n\nPS. I'll review this again once I've played all the way through and played some more multiplayer and see if I change my mind. I'll also try and condense this ridiculously rambling text wall into something vaguely readable, at some point. Oh, and I LOVE how Steam censors <n i g g l y> but arsed is fine, lol.\n\nPPS.

There is no way it can be as buggy and blocky like it was in Beta.  Right?".

Very cringeworthy\n-Subtitles look like a game from a PS1 game that didn't get the proper funding.\n-DLC before basic mechanics are finished. I mean, look at the patch notes...\n-No damage boxes... I know it was stated that this was going to be the direction from the get go but with this "final product" it just seems like someone said, "Screw it, people will still buy it.".\n\nI wanted to make a video and at least show how the multiplayer was fun but it crashes with every video cap program... just straight up fails on the opening.\n\nWith the last note under the Cons, I am tired of this feeling.

While there's a whole host of performance and mechanical issues with the game, the reason why I keep uninstalling it is because far too many design choices are simply self-defeating.\n\nHere's a few of them:\n-No saving in single player missions.\n-seemingly unskippable cutscenes (which can easily last 5 minutes, making replaying a mission truly obnoxious).\n-no way to leave multiplayer quick match without force quitting.\n- the utterly bizarre decision to fill cutscenes with frozen characters. Descends into farce when the camera zooms into motionless characters' faces when delivering exposition.\n-The conversion of the Warmachine ruleset into something where it feels like absurd effort has thrown at the simplest of enemies.\n\nNone of these seem to be design features that should have escaped QC, let alone early access. In particular, the unskippable, farcical cut-scenes smacks of a hole in the budget that got filled in an 'arty' fashion. Game balance feels truly out the window, simply because everything feels extraordinarily pillow-fisted, so massive effort has to be hurled at largely inconsequencial enemies.\n\nThe main gameplay feels like a kludgy, sticky mess where you often feel like you're fighting the controls more than the enemy. The AI is pants-on-head dumb, making Skirmish mode some what akin to shooting fish in a barrel. The conversion of the Warmachine ruleset often feels extraordinary restrictive and often poorly signalled (it is often hard to tell a unit's facing, which makes the facing rules a frequent pain). Knowledge of the tabletop game feels essential to making the game playable, yet the game doesn't clue you into the changes it's made to units' abilities so even that knowledge is often wrong. Mechanics and effects often feel wonky or unpredictable (I've watched an electro-leap leap to an enemy a screen away, which basically the opposite of what it's supposed to do). It often feels like the camera is deliberately annoying you, hiding itself behind terrain when you're trying to see what's going on.\n\nMultiplayer feels extraordinarily hampered by a limited pallette of options as well as the aforementioned Quick Match issue. Frankly, I've gotten one game of multiplayer in the year I've owned the game. Apparently, multiplayer missions have flags and killboxes, but I've no idea what either looks like because the game doesn't seem to show them.\n\nThe core campaign is little better. It's your bog-standard 'discover macguffin, fight to macguffin, fight off people who want it, then destroy it' plot that seems to be the default RTS plot design and Sturgis might as well be called 'Arthas' for the originality in his contribution. Due to Jakes being as pillow-fisted as the rest of the units, the missions often feel like they've got a reversed difficulty level, with some of the toughest missions coming at the start and the late game missions feeling much easier. Again, the AI is dumb as a box of bricks, often letting you dictate the pace of missions because enemies often won't activate until you attack them (the sterling winner has to be a late mission, where the Butcher will gleefully run around in front of your guns like a headless chicken). Mission design itself often feels profoundly unfun, with many missions with multiple fronts, something that just doesn't work with the Warmachine game mechanics. The game often doesn't signal the arrival of enemy reinforcements, leading to you often just spotting reinforcements by accident halfway through a turn. I shouldn't have to play 'hunt the mechanithrall' at the start of the turn, but there's no better way to check you know what's going on. Missions often require you to keep a number of character units alive, but this often causes auto-wipes half-way through missions as they're profoundly squishy. Special marks have to go to the second longest running character in the campaign, known either as Sarge or 'Trencher Sergeant'. Looking identical to his fellow Trenchers, he's easy to lose to enemy attacks and suffers the indignity of never being given an actual name.\n\nThe unit selection feels a lot like someone went through the minature game, picked their favourite models and stuck them in. In particular, once you've unlocked Jakes' feat, it really doesn't feel like it works well with the rest of the Cygnaran army. It's a close combat buff, but there's only two melee infantry available and one of them already has all the buffs she hands out. There's also a paucity of repair units, which only makes the campaign harder. The 'alternate weapon' variants of infantry (like the Trencher Grenadier and Winter Guard Rocketeer) have almost identical (if there is a difference, I haven't noticed it) appearances, which means you often have no idea what the enemy troops are armed with until they fire it at you.\n\nSo the big question is 'can this be fixed?' I really don't think so. The game cries out for a complete overhaul of the mechanics, but that'll take ages and if it hasn't been done yet, I doubt it's ever going to happen. Fixing the awful cutscenes would cost a ton. Realistically, the only things that can be overhauled are the array of bugs and poor design choices. An option to save during missions and skip cutscenes would be a nice start to making this a lot more user friendly.\n\nSo in the end do I recommend this game? No. It simply never feels fun to play. While it has a few bright spots (a late game stealth mission is surprisingly fun for a stealth mission) the single player has a difficulty curve more akin to a roller-coaster, terrible cut-scenes and profoundly bad mission design. Skirmish mode is as challenging as beating a puppy and just as much fun. Multiplayer seems to be completely dead. It's a shame, but that's the truth.","February 18","false","38.8"," 50 of 54 people (93%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","93","50","54","3","0"

Didn't bother with the early access though, as I've learned it could spoil the fun of finding your way through the game once it's released, so I waited till official release became available.\n\nTo my dissapointment, at the time of writing despite being released the game is far from actually feeling like a polished product ready for shipping. At best it's a public beta. Counter-intuitive in-game controls, camera which is tending to look everywhere other than where you need it, blurry and very slow graphic (12 FPS on GTX 650 1920x1020, seriously?). Obviously it hasn't been playtested properly yet, so a patch or two might get it all fixed.\n\nUnfortunately, lack of optimisation it's not the only problem. I didn't play the original tabletop game, but I do enjoy turn-based tactic strategies such as XCOM, and, I am sorry to say that, this game falls short of the modern standard for the genre. The introductory narrative in the beginning of the single player campaign fails to communicate even who I am, who the war is with, and for what cause, main characters say pretentious fluff and refer to georgraphic locations I've never heard of, voice acting is dreadful and amateurish. As a result I lost interest after 30 minutes of playing, and will uninstall the whole thing.

Textures are very pixelated in close-ups (no texture filtering at all).\n\nThe gameplay itself could be good if interface, camera and performance issues wouldn't ruin the experience.\n\nEvery mission starts with the camera in a stupid position and you need to adjust it, fighting with unacceptable camera controls: the camera turns around its own pivot instead of turning around the scene. It also can be zoomed in beyond the ground! It feels like a free floating debug camera. Also, the camera jumps back and forth in order to focus on every performed action, which turns out being very annoying. There are so many strategy games to look at for inspiration; I don't get how it can be like that.\n\nThe clumsy GUI requires some effort to get it (not the most intuitive one) and some of its elements are way too big, e.g. log and dialog texts (huge and blurry). I play PC games in front of my screen, no need to make texts readable to my neighbors ( ;\n\nLast but not least, the interactions with the units and buttons are sometimes screwed up, so you need to deselect-reselect your unit.\n\nSo overall, the game shows some promise, but it feels like there's still a lot to polish.

Units will face the wrong direction even when you tell it to change facing.  This leads to two different units with their backs touching but they are swinging swords at each other??  Colors for walk/run/control area are very hard to see in the background colors of the boards and you cannot adjust them.

I don't play the table top game which may or may not have to do with it, but I was looking for a fun and good a strategy game. Sure you go through the first nonsense levels which are boring and more of a learning tool. The stragtegy is sort of there but how you movement and action is somewhat linear. Your not making any big plays. Pretty much your biggest decision is how many points of action your going to give what warjack.\n\nI wasn't looking for an X-com experince like so many people are, but the game would feel a lot more fun if you chose your load outs, which you can do in pvp. Your stuck with what you got.\n\nAdvancement is another issue for me.  Your main character does advance but it keeps everything on par, It sort of reminds me of dead island is the way of advancement, it doesn't change the game all that much. Zombies or in this case trenchers and war jacks are on the same level as you, to the point that you never really even get that slight edge through side battles or a tech tree.\n\nCombat is rather boring in general.  No new weapons or any major skills. Combat can be annoying because when you want to attack you have to turn a trencher or war jack in the direction you want to attack, which doesn't cost any action points but I don't understand why they just can't make trencher turn around on his own when you want to attack the baddie. It may sound trival but it's annoying when you spend 5 minutes just turning your guys around.\n\nYou might have 2-3 trenchers with 87% chance of hitting the target, yet two out of three miss. For having these high percentage rates of hitting the target there is a lot missing going on.  Healing is sort of a joke, you get one or two points back which is a good deal but it's prolly not going to save you.\n\nNothing new is really brought into this tactical game, which sometimes is a good thing, but you sit there and think..."okay attack this guy, you attack him. Now you. Hmmm still not dead, okay you attack". It's pretty much, moving around in a small stage saying "This is what I got, I see what you got, let's do this".\n\nEven in x-com your % range is off, but the cover system is put into place for this. You don't have a cover system.\n\nGraphic wise, i'm not a grapic snob but they seem fine. I don't want to beat up on the game too much, no one really caes about the voice acting unless it's actually good, It's cheesy and can be over looked but there is something to be said about having great voice actors. They make you like the character, there really is no attachment here.\n\nThe game is sort of average, I'm not sure how I even feel about it. I sort of want to give it a four because I thought it would be different, but that's on me. I give it a 5/10 because it's just average.  I can't get excited about it.","December 28, 2014","false","1.4"," 59 of 85 people (69%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","69","59","85","4","0"

At this point it's pretty fair to judge it on what's inside it. Overall the price reduction is well warranted and helps justify purchasing this game.\n\nAs a Warmachine player and gamer I cannot recommend this product unfortunatly. While it's very fun seeing these models come to life the UI and gameplay is still "buggy" and clunky.\n\nIn comparison to other turn based strategy games, it is entirely too easy to give improper orders. A total lack of in game saves turns this problem from a mild irretant to a rage quit. Further the AI is a mixed bag of being exploitable while the rule set can easily see important models murdered in one lucky turn.\n\nThe core campaign's gamemechanics are too close to the tabletop to produce a strong experience. I have had a miserable time trying to force myself to finish the campaign and have had all kinds of weirdness, stupidity, and frustration occur on missions 5 and 6. The infinite-respawning enemies are not clearly marked and it takes attempts to learn the eccentracies of the missions. Again the lack of save states hinders a smooth experience.\n\nBeyond that the dialogue and storytelling are a bit lackluster. There are novice errors throughout. It feels both indie and professional at the same time which leads to mixed expectations.\n\nI'm not sorry that I own or purchased this game. In point of fact I'm happy I supported this adventure.

The price as many have indicated is based on KickStrater, and for most people I would recomend waiting until release when the price will be much lower.  However, those who have played the TT will realize the $65 is nothing compared to how much money and time it takes to get a army up and running.

But I remain confident the PP will grant us a game worthy of the title Warmachine.  A few major issues for newbies, is the lack of explainations of abilities.

For those TT players I say you will miss the in person interaction with your enemy.  You are forced to sit there for 3-10min per round in silence watching a turn go by and there is no chit chat.  I miss the cheers of "WHAT A HIT" or the cries of "YOU GOTTA BE KIDDING ME!" as the game played out.  A audio connection would be great or a chat box would be nice at least.\n\nUnits have moved from single point kills  to multi-point health, and that is nice, but I feel that this has greatly shifited the balance of power.  Now a few "solo" units can easily take down a  warjack in a turn or 2, and a Warjack can have 2-3 hits on a SINGLE unit and not kill it.  So when your Jack is ganged up on by 3 units, it has almost no chance!  Something needs fixed on that.\n\nOverall this is a game to get.  For those who have played TT, now is a great time to buy, it's a low cost compared to what you have spent already on TT, and you'll get free stuff, Newbies its great to learn in a beta with few armies options, so the matches will be as even as they will ever be.   However, PP will try to sell the the moon with in-game upgrades, so if this game releases at $20 (and who knows!) the $45 you'll save may be better spent upgrading to the units you want, and not the freebies they'll give you in the Deluxe.","July 30, 2014","true","14.5"," 36 of 51 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","36","51","0","0"

A typical skirmish game takes about 30-45 minutes.  For $40, I think that's a pretty fair price for what you'll eventually get when this game is complete, not to mention that there's going to be a 21-mission single player campaign too.\n\nFun is what it is, and it's pretty close to the tabletop miniature game.  It has so much ridiculous potential that if you're a fan of the Iron Kingdoms lore, miniature wargaming, and/or the X-Com style of turn-based strategy combat, then you'll have many hours of fun with this game in my opinion.","September 25, 2014","true","14.1"," 36 of 51 people (71%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","71","36","51","2","0"

I played single player multiple times and multiplayer twice.  The game plays up the randomness too much.  While it translates a lot of the rules from tabletop, theres a different feeling when you are the one rolling the dice rather than a randomizer.  Having an entire turn of misses scroll across the screen is demoralizing.\n\nWhen I'm playing single player, my guys were just as survivable as the enemies.  I've done a fair number of turn-based games and when you're fighting against a force that respawns, your guys are usually just better.  I played mission 8 (the one where you kill a bunch of inactive juggernauts) and stopped.  Unless you get the perfect rolls and do things in the right order, one of the 3 (Rourke usually) gets smeared into paste by stray shots after holding him back the entire game to avoid it.\n\nAnimation isn't smooth.  It's incredibly choppy and the game plus along at 8FPS.  It's terrible seeing as I'm playing far more power hungry games at better graphics levels with no issue.\n\nFinally, the mechanics within the game seem random.  So I move Jakes up and cast Positive Charge on my Lancer before attacking (doable on the tabletop) to get the bonus.  Instead, everything stops.  At other times, I can cast and attack.  Or the Lancer changes from a 2x2 grid size to a 1x1 grid size.\n\nWhen making charges, you are warned about opportunity attacks.  So I'll pick a charge lane, go at it to find out that they didn't notify me of this opportunity attack.\n\nAll-in-all, this isn't a complete game.  If you want this style of game in fantasy, look at the Fire Emblem games from Nintendo.  If you want it in Sci-Fi, look at XCom.  But for the love of all that is holy, don't get this in it's current state.  I've wasted too much time trying to play this and I'm always frustrated by the end.","December 21, 2014","false","19.3"," 31 of 43 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","31","43","0","0"

Now there's plenty of people hopping on thanks to the Humble Bundle during March of 2016.\nSo for those either veterans to Warmachine of just interested in purchasing or coming back. Here's the lowdown, the ruleset from the tabletop are almost perfectly executed here. The turn times are as long as the tabletop, so this remains pretty faithful to the traditional game. HOWEVER, the UI is clunky,and the performance is mediocre. However, it seems the devs are beginning to come back to this game and patch it.  They also rolled out something that seems a bit more reasonable DLC model that would almost encourage me to buy them if the game ran properly. But we shall see won't we?\n\nThe reviews highlighted as of writing this are quite dated, they're before the VOW OF IMPROVEMENT by the devs. I bought into it after some of these so called improvements and still find them wanting. However, keep an eye out yourself, this game has the potential to be amazing, anybody who has even a remote interest in tabletop wargaming can find something appealing about this. It's just not there yet.\n\nYou see, there's a lot of things going for this game. Those who were interested in the tabletop game but didn't have a local hobby store to play it could effectively get a more flashy digital version in theory. For the most part that's correct. But right now the UI is clunky, it feels unresponsive and the forced motion blur on unit movement is almost sickening. Not too bad if you get the right angle however. The models on the other hand are beautifully crafted, in fact I think they put the most effort in the visuals of the models rather than the gameplay.  Which I guess SORT OF makes sense, because a miniature wargame based on detailed models should have some pretty damn detailed models in the digital incarnation, but that doesn't excuse shoddy practices. But their price adjustment seems to be pretty faithful.\n\nSome things that need to be fixed\nOptimization\nTone down motion blur effects\nStreamline the UI and make it more accessible and responsive.\nUI Should be more customizable\n\n\nIn closing, do I recommend this game? Yes, but on one condition, if you're a gambler who wants to see the devs polish this diamond in the rough, and boy is it rough. But there's a diamond in there, I assure you. So my advice is to keep an eye out on their announcements, and check the discussion board every now and again, maybe people will start saying some nice things rather than tossing insults at the devs who only sort of deserve it. Hey, we're gamers, it's our money, we have a right to be ♥♥♥♥♥y lil gobshites. I'm certain there's a great game under all of this, and with the HUGE patch coming, I figure it'll become a lot more obvious. Overall, I do indeed recommend it, but you can always play it safe and keep an eye on the community's developing opinions.\n\n\nUpdate 3/14/2016: Managed to talk to the devs, they really seem to be dedicated to fixing the game, which gives me even more confidence in my purchase. The gameplay of the game is solid as of writing the review, you just have to fight the UI at times.","March 10","true","4.3"," 19 of 22 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","19","22","0","1"

It's graphically beautiful with excellent animations, fun ragdolls and a boatload of fantastic effects. It's very clearly a labour of love too, visible in all the little details you can find in the textures and on the models. The boardgame rules translate flawlessly onto the PC as well, turning a game that can take hours to play into something you can play in half an hour or so. The abilities are cool, the units feel unique and powerful, and tactical play is just so genuinely satisfying.\n\nI'm not seeing a lot of cons either. Most of my issues with the game as it stands come with the fact it's in Early Access. It's an incomplete, in progress game. It's got its crashes, its glitches, its frame drops and all that, but it's so easily forgivable. I don't regret a single minute spent on this game and I'm excited to return to it as it gets updated. This is also definitely a game that I could see myself gobbling down DLC for, getting new armies and units. The content you get with the main purchase is definitely, in my humble opinion, a full game's worth too, so I don't feel like it's unwarranted to do so. A solid singleplayer campaign and a nice selection of armies and units for multiplayer. It feels complete in that regard, and I'm certain they'll be adding onto it before the game comes out proper.\n\nThat being said, I do need to point out that this is a boardgame turned into a PC game, and thus the main crowd it attracts are the boardgamers, the war gamers, the tactical turn based gamers. It's methodical. It rewards understanding your units and their abilities, thinking through your actions, making smart plays and using positioning to your advantage. It's not for everyone, but boy oh boy, it's definitely for me.","October 16, 2014","true","4.8"," 45 of 68 people (66%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","66","45","68","2","0"

I have a 6-core 3.5Ghz processor, and while my graphics card isn't all that hot, it is an Nvidia gaming card... and this is not a real-time FPS.  It's a table-top game with "flavor" animations... most of the game, very little on the screen is moving, yet I have to turn the video settings way down to keep the audio from being choppy, and I still get terrible frame rates.  There is no reason a game that is presenting a mostly-still image should get such terrible performance, even with a cheap video card.  I was really surprised to see the game released and it still be hardly any better when I tried it out shortly after it went into beta.  The developers shouldn't have started working on DLC, they should be working on fixing the problems with the game.\n\nAs others have noted, the UI is very clunky, and the number of times I move a unit to the wrong location because the UI interpreted my click wierdly is annoying (and I've only played 4 hours!), and accidentally entering melee with a unit you meant to shoot at can mean the difference between winning and losing a battle.  The camera is difficult to maneuver, it's hard to find all your foes (you can't see the mini-map during focus allocation), and it's easy to lose track of active enemy units among all the dead enemies and visual clutter.\n\nThis game had lots of potential, and it could still be fixed... I'm just afraid that the developers don't see the problems here.\n\nThe reproduction of the tabletop game is, as far as I've seen, rather good.

Bad UI. Bad gameplay. Bad board-game port. Bad graphics. Bad sound. Bad skirmish-mode. Bad campaign. Good not one thing I could find. I've been trying to force myself to play this game in the hopes of eventually liking it, but but I cannot find a single redeeming quality.\n\n28. Des. 2015 - One year after release.\nUI: Mouse-clicks need to hit the correct pixel to choose units, meaning I need to click 3-9 times every time I want to choose a new unit. UI is otherwise very clunky and dependent on on-display buttons to control your units, which slows down gameplay to a crawl. Plenty of UI glitches causing unit-control to fail and causing a turnover for my most powerful units.\n\nGeneral Gameplay: Developers chose an engine what was unable to handle the board-game. The result is a game uning the Warmashine brand without being Warmachine. Everything in this game is a poor look-alike. The difference in particular doesen't use the PC-medium to improve gameplay, rather being a result of poor development and decisions. The developers also doesen't have a clue, evident in the many many unelegant solutions for gameplay and presentation. They made mistakes I haven't seen in PC-games since the 90s.\n\nGraphics and Sound: All the lines are too soft, affording the game a generic cartoonish look. The colors are way too vibrant. The music and sounds are very repetitive and I turned them off after playing for about an hour. I was getting a headache.\n\nSkirmish and Multiplayer: The maps are very small, leaving no real room for manouvering. The game is so poor that the entire worldwide playerbase can be measured in two digits, making finding players for mm a chore.\n\nCampaign: The missions are drawn-out and have an unappealing design. The dialogue make me cringe, and are partially unskippable. Cutsceenes are ugly, meaningless and unskippable. The mission objectives are very unclear (Example: Protect the train - but the train is 1/4 of the scenario graphics and there is no way of knowing which pixel you need to protect or how fast and under which conditions the enemy can harm it. Example: Move down the gorge - but the gorge have 3 directions and there is no way of knowing which way is "down".)","December 27, 2015","false","43.0"," 18 of 21 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","18","21","0","0"

It has really good graphics for a game of its type (though unoptimized at this point), the sounds and music are great (though some sounds appear to be missing), the UI is currently a placeholder, and it works, but is ugly and unintuitive. There are two maps (which are nicely designed, but there need to be quite a few more), 4 armies (though there is no customization of what you're taking yet), and a single singleplayer mission.\n\nThe pricing is unfortunate, but if they'd priced it lower than the kickstarter beta access, they'd have ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off early backers. But pricing it the same pisses off Steam users. Probably would have been better not to do a Steam Early Access, or at least do it closer to release at a more reasonable price point. At least there are goodies included with the extra price, which you won't get with the standard edition.\n\nIn conclusion, I'd like to give the game a 'sort of' recommendation. On the fence? Wait for release, buy it for $20 (I think that's what the final game will cost).

If it's advertised as so, it's a lie. It's very much unpolished - you can, for example, zoom into the ground, revealing hidden units or objects (NOTE: This issue has been corrected in the recent patches). It has potential to be a great game, but there are a few things you should consider before buying. First of all, this game came from Kickstarter, where it received more than 1.5 million dollars to be produced. Anyone who plays it, though, wouldn't say that it feels like a "1.5 million game". There are much better games in the market produced with less money. I was a kickstarter backer and I feel kind of deceived, because it doesn't look like all the money we gave to the developers was well spent in producing the great game that was promised.\n\nVoice acting is bad, the story is bad, gameplay is decent at the very best, and the main characters are very poorly animated. I don't know how they decided that "animate the wind blowing the character's clothes" was more important than "ANIMATE THE MAIN CHARACTERS FACES WHILE SPEAKING". Really, in all dialogues what you get is a blunt face staring at emptiness, while a voice-over is played - done by someone who clearly isn't a native English speaker. Hell, I'm not even english or american and I can tell the voice acting is bad and done by someone who's not completely fluent.\n\nBottomline: if you're a fan of tactical turn based games like me, wait for a Steam Sale and get it; however, you should also be open-minded and have a lot of patience to overcome Warmachine's current shortcomings. If you're not a die-hard fan of the genre, don't even bother.\n\nIt will also depend on how developers will fix/improve this game with patches over time.

I loved the tabletop wargame and was looking forward to this like you wouldn't believe. And as far as a port of the tabletop game...it works. Visually it may not be stunning, but it's faithful to it's source...the control system is easy to use and manages to reflect the tactical side of the tabletop game...so if you are playing against a human opponent, this does what it set out to do.\n\nThe campaign doesn't.\nThe campaign has a horrible habit of spawning opponents with no warning or indication, even repeat spawning, so the tactical side of each mission goes to the wayside. I think the mark of a good strategy game should be the ability to complete each map by being good at marshalling your forces and being a good commander...not by having played each map to the point that you know where all the spawns are and how long to hang around in one place. But repeat plays are the order of the day, here. You play the maps, get your butt handed to you by the enemy forces...not because they were better, but because they got a spawn...and then once you learn all the stuff that happens you play through and win. Your strategy is dictated by the timed events in each map, which leaves you with little actual room for innovative tactics.\nThe map that drove this home is one where your force is breaking through a gate, while being attacked by pursuing forces. Those forces are represented by increasingly tougher waves of spawned enemies, that will just continue to spawn until you move through the gate...so setting up a defensive line and weathering the storm is not an option...you're forced into a survive then run tactic.\nAnd thats the problem. For a tactical game...the campaign wants you to do what IT considers the best tactic. Railroading is not fun in these kinds of game. So until that improves, I can't recommend it.","January 31, 2015","false","2.3"," 23 of 32 people (72%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","72","23","32","0","0"

Buy it if you're a die-hard Warmachine fan, but it's different from the tabletop.\n\nBeing fully released for a while now, Whitemoon Dreams has certainly made an impressive game for only having a little over a year for development and being an Indie Developer. That being said, the game still suffers from optimization issues and bugs. They are almost doing themselves a disservice by putting an FPS moniter in the corner of the screen. Playing through the single player campaign, my FPS changed with every mission, some hovering around 50, while others struggled to get above 15. The graphics setting do allow you to gain a few FPS by knocking down the quality, but sometimes that doesn't even help. Another big stumbling block is the bugs, which have gotten better. Sometimes these bugs are a simple graphical glitch, but other times, they either make the game crash or don't let a unit finish attacking, effectivly ending the game. In the campaign, the cut scenes are sometimes fully animated, but other times, it's just panning shots of still models. I actually prefer this to the way other games just plop the idle characters into place, idle animations and absense of lip-syncing ruining your sense of immersion. I understand that Whitemoon can only do so much, being an indie developer, and have limited manpower, but the cut scenes just feel inconsistant.\n\nTo anyone who plays the tabletop, this is a similar experiance, but there's a great differance. Some good, some bad. For one, it's a grid based system, as opposed to freely moving about the field to whatever distance is desired. This system makes melee ranges interesting. Stats are made more akin to a "out of 5" system, making some things hit harder than the tabletop, while others suffer. Another change is that Warjacks no longer have systems on thier damage grids, and it is instead more akin to a health bar now. Of all the changes from the table top, I really wish this one had stayed. In addition, certain units have gained abilites, like Assault Kommando Flamethrowers can now "Flush out" enemies hiding behind cover and push them back. On the subject of warrior models, there are no units in this game, all grunts are now solos with about 8 - 15 health. As a result, some damage has been amplified, like corrosion does 3 damage a turn and fire is even more potent. Warcasters, however, keep the same health they have on the table top.\n\nDespite all this, I still adore this game. I love seeing the tabletop game come to life. I love seeing the animated cut scenes in the campaign. I love the progression that the main protagonist goes through. I love seeing units breathed new life with new abilities and mechanichs. I love the communication that the Developers have with the community, and how often they update the game.\n\nAll in all, it's not perfect, but I love it all the same.","December 7, 2014","true","76.1"," 40 of 63 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","40","63","0","0"

Though I am happy that it is mostly a faithful recreation of the original tabletop miniatures game, with just enough new and different elements to make it unique and interesting. This is more than just what battle chess was to chess (ie, fancy animations added to a classic game), but instead every unit and mechanic of Warmachine is given a revamp to suit what is basically a squad based tactical game.\n\nI love the progress in the game so far (being early access beta) and can't wait for the finished product, so I can twist the arms of people I know to grab a copy, so that I may play against them.","October 18, 2014","true","14.5"," 21 of 29 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","21","29","0","0"

This review is based on a single player experience.\n\nThis game is like a daily crossword puzzle.. There is a slight challenge and an even slighter sense of accomplishment when you complete it ultimately though no one goes online and reviews a crossword puzzle cause well it's a crossword puzzle.. This game doesn't allow you to do anything other than play their missions who show up one after another after another without a pause in between to save the game and go eat (or something crazy like that). One unit "levels up" after each mission and I use the word level up loosely cause all that happens is one of those units gets a stat increase that is not in your control, it just happens. You have no say over any part of the missions, the game gives you a goal and tells you what to do..\n\nThis game is boring enough without adding more to this review but unfortunately there is a MAJOR flaw to the game which is the camera.. Please watch gameplay reviews before buying this game cause the camera angles (which constantly change every time an action is taken) are horrific, more often then not the "action" camera will zoom into the wrong area thus not letting you see what the opponent actually did! The only way to play this game is to continuously adjust the camera to an overhead angle and zoom it all the way out or else you have no idea where everyone is. So graphics mean nothing (not that this game boasts good graphics) in this game when you are playing a far overhead game..\n\nAnyways, my two cents","November 22, 2014","false","2.7"," 32 of 49 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","32","49","0","0"

And my reaction as soon as I touched Warmachine was, "THIS GAME IS WAY MORE POLISHED THAN MORDHEIM. HOW IS IT'S RATING WORST!?"\n\nThe answer is of course that Warhammer's IP is more popular, so people flock to that. Warmachine did alot of things right. I shall endeavour to explain why I feel this game deseves more love.\n\nTHE KEY TO HAVING FUN: Is to understand that this is basically a digital TABLETOP wargame. Expect long turn times, units on a table, and numbers you could care less about reading. That's pretty faithful to the source material, so I can hardly fault the developers. People are upset because the Models' mouth don't move during cutscenes or the controls are weird, or whatever. Who cares.  I treat it as a board game and has loads of fun. If you can keep this in mind and understand that miniatures shouldn't be animated anyway, you won't have much to complain about. Cheaper than buying the actual models right? Of course, if they made this as a pure digital boardgame, it would probably be way better.\n\nWho Would Like this Game: People who like motion blurs, somewhat complex boardgames and tea breaks in front of their computer, have no problem with the dice gods and aren't anal about faithfulness to the source material (2 die, 3 die, who cares?)\n\nWho Would NOT like this Game: People who care alot about perfect animation, smoothness, perfect controls, a thriving multiplayer matchmaking service and a populous community. And video games. None of which applies to this game.\n\n+ Proper ruler Based Movement (none of that WASD FPS nonsense Mordheim gets up to where you can't see what's around the corner- instead, it emulates the ruler based movements of the tabletop fairly well)\n+ Small map (thank goodness, otherwise games would take forever)\n+ Zoom out for bird's eye view (for proper tactical gauging)\n+ Easy to comprehend information bars.\n+ Excellent Unit Models, Lots of Factions\n+ A kind of still alive Multiplayer (you may want to arrange games through the community groups, play with friends, or campaign. If you want a definitely alive TBS multiplayer, Warhammer 40k: Regicide is what you want).\n+ Not a pure RNG game. Positioning is actually somewhat important as are "Combined Ranged Attacks".\n\nCons\n- Motion Blur can be eyewatering. The key, I find, is to just find an angle you're comfortable with and play, the map is small, there's no need to move around as much.\n- Stupid control scheme, takes some getting used to, but once you do, it's fine. (I hit tap the X key for unit deactiviation. Saves me time and sanity)\n- Long turn times. I move all of my units and attacks. The opponent does the same. You want TEA while you're doing this. Not really a con per se, because this is what a tabletop game is like.\n- Annoying numbers and things you have to read. Fortunately it's organized. Fortunately you can just ignore it. I DON'T READ. I zerg Rush and Bayonet the enemy. Like a Baws.\n\nTLDR; Try the Demo, treat it like a board game, not a video game, it doesn't hurt and you have full access to the multiplayer (minus some units).","March 9","true","2.5"," 22 of 31 people (71%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","71","22","31","2","1"

If the "early access" is like $20 then maybe it be ok but even then it's still asking a bit much.  What you see in the trailers on steam you honestly aren't getting any of those yet.\n\nThe game is poorly optimized if at all.  I realize it's in "beta" but even with my machine it's having frame issues.  There's no voice over for any characters so the game feels dull when you move them.  The UI sucks, there no graphics to the UI, it's literally just a wall of text.\n\nFrom the beta I played for the KS backers there was only 2 factions to be.  I'm not sure if there was multiple maps because the game was so bad I couldn't stand it.  I closed the game in the middle of a match with another player.\n\nSeriously, this is the type of game Privateer Press think it's OK to put up on steam for $65 especially at this stage?  You might as well just keep this crap to in house testers and still label it as pre-alpha.\n\nFuture game developers/publishers...  Stop using Early Access to rake in easy money.  Either let people sign up to test your game for free and actually give you feedback instead of making them spend X money and hating you for putting out a shoddy title.  I'm sorry but people's review that gave this a thumbs up are either trying to justify their poor purchases or they really like to ride that warjack pole.\n\nAnyone who reads my review you have been warned, definitely not worth $65 and I actually wish I can get my backer money back this is some BS.

So check those discussion threads and make sure this game will work for you now before buying it, or wait untill the the full release.\nAs it is currently Warmachine is a fantastic tactical game with good balance and different feel between the factions.

Contrary to most, this game will actually decrease in price as it gets clsoer to release, just like we have seen with Planetary Annihilation. Therefore this review is based on a 20$ game.\n\nThe game itself looks gorgeous. There does seem to be a little overemphasis on the glow effects, but other than that and a few graphical bugs expected during beta the game is a real beauty. There is a definite lack of features and areas to play in, but that again is also to be expect in the game's current stage of development.\n\nGameplay wise it could not be better. This game more than any other I have played brings the tabletop to the desktop. They have very succesfully transferred what is a very top quality tabletop boardgame and directly applied it in terms of look and gameplay to the PC. Players take turn moving their (now fully animated and awesome) miniatures and attacking, with all of the actions avaliable in a simple and effection fashion. The UI is clearly unfinished so we cannot take a good look at that yet, but the layout is very intuitive and the ability to move your camera right down into the heart of the action makes for some really exciting action moments rarely seen in the turn based genre.\n\nOverally I conclude that the game is already enjoyable, but only about 50% feature complete and I very much look forward to the final product as all of the work so far is superb.","July 18, 2014","true","8.0"," 39 of 66 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","39","66","0","0"

However for a "released" game it is lacking in some basics that other turn-based strategy games already have inplace. Such as oh I don't know the option to save in mission; either you complete a mission or you have to start the mission from the beginning. There is also no fog of war in this game, so when you are in a mission you can see all the enemy units (excluding any trigger created units).Looking at other reviews I see I am not the only one who is very disappointed in the choppy camera functions but this could easily be fixed. The controls for the camera are terrible and simply awful in comparison to other strategy games. Rather than a simple hold shift (or other key) and move the mouse to adjust the angle or rotate the camera, you have multiple sets of keys you to use in order to manipulate the camera to the desired position. But overall, I would still recommend the game. I just hope that the developers fix the various glitches and the camera controls.","December 8, 2014","true","11.0"," 18 of 27 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","18","27","0","0"

That being said, it pains me to do it, but I just can't recommend this game.\n\nMinutes in, you'll see how horribly optimized it is with framerate drops, freezes, etc. And sweet jesus, someone needs to explain to me how you can miss 90% chance hits, 90% of the time. The game will make you want to put your head in a vice and start squeezing.\n\nMy biggest issue would be with pathfinding. While a lot of times, you won't have an issue running off into the distance to regroup, sometimes your units will choose to run right in front of multiple enemies versus taking the equally long, but wide open route. The free strikes involved will make a huge difference in-game.\n\nOther small issues are all within the quality of the game itself. The voice acting is unbearable, the cut scenes are of PS1 quality where the ragdoll effects are fairly competent (priorities?), the camera is TERRIBLE. There is no way to get it just straight up and down with the maps, or to redirect it to look around buildings and similar when trying to move units. This results in your clicks, though clearly on the ground around the corner, to be redirected to the front of the building. sacrificing your movement.\n\nClearly I've got some gripes, but a small part of me believes that with these frequent updates (anywhere from 500MB to 3GB), one of them will actually get it right. Till that happens, I can't fathom giving this game a thumbs up. It's physically painful to play.","December 20, 2015","false","5.9"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","11","14","0","2"

This could be an awesome game. As another reviewer noted, Warmachine: Tactics is ideal for a board game to PC game adaptation, due to its complicated rules of combat and movement. But this seems more like a prototype than a finished product. The basic complaints are all true, the buggy camera is especially annoying. The music is irritating, and apparently never changes. After a couple hours I finally just turned it off entirely. In spite of the bugs, I really gave this game a solid try, but 6 hours in and I'm just giving up.\n\nThe big deal killer for me is three times now, after 30-40 minutes of play on the train crash map, a system notice will pop up, taking focus off the game window, and the game instantly crashes. This wouldn't be so bad if progress was saved, but nope, gotta start the map all over again. Compare Warmachine to XCOM: Enemy Within, which was released around the same time.

While it is faithful to the tabletop game it is based upon, it currently offers little for the large price attached to it. I will go into more detail below.\n\nPros\n+ The Asthetics - The game is set in the Iron Kingdoms, a high-fantasy world designed by Privateer Press that mixes magic and steampunk technology, resulting in the trademark multi-ton Warjacks of the franchise, and the Warcasters who control them. Each faction has a very distinctive design and colour palette (from the armoured and crimson Khador to the clean white and gothic-like Protectorate), so no matter what your taste one or several of the factions should appeal to you.\n\n+ Performance - In eight hours of gameplay, I have only suffered a single crash and malfunction in the game. The game seems to be in a surprisingly stable state. My only complaint about the preformance would be that on a low-medium setting, I am only getting 15-20 FPS. However, I am unsure weither this is because of the game being unoptimized or because my computer is getting a bit old. Nevertheless, if you have a somewhat modern rig, you shouldn't have any problems running the game at a pleasant FPS.\n\n+ Fun-factor - Being a player of the tabletop Warmachine, the prospect of seeing the normally still and silent models come to life is very entertaining. Then watching the behemoth Warjacks swatting away infantry like insects is thrilling. The team behind Warmachine: Tactics has faithfully remade the tabletop units into the game. and they look, move and feel as they should. Add to this good sound and visual effects (I have no doubt these will be further improved upon) and satisfying ragdoll effects.\nEven in its currently limited state, I have enjoyed every minute of the eight hours I have so far spent playing Warmachine Tactics, and I am certain that I will continue to play it for hours to come, both before and after the game's release.\n\nCons\n- Early Access - As it stands, the game is in a pretty unfinished state. While the game runs quite well (Only one crash in eight hours of gameplay, and no game-breaking glitches or bugs.), it is unoptimized. Alongside this, many of the features that are intended to be in the final release are not yet implemented. All four main factions (Khador, Cygnar, Protectorate, Cryx) have only one battlegroup of units available, and this battlegroup can't yet be modified. There are also only two multiplayer maps, and one singleplayer mission available.\nThe advantage of buying the game during the Early Access is the addition of the Digital Deluxe edition, which includes some future paid DLC for free.\n\n- The Price - For what the game Currently offers, it is expensive. When the game is released it will be sold at a lower than current price, but at the disadvantage of not including some of the paid DLC that will be released after the game's release. By buying it now you will recieve the game, some future paid DLC for free And being able to play the game in it's current form.\nAccording to the developers, the combined cost of the finished game and DLC will be higher than the current price for the Digital Deluxe edition on sale here.\n\nConclusion - Before you make any purchase, you should look up some gameplay videos on YouTube. There are many to chose from, and don't be afraid of watching several before deciding weither or not this game is for you. I also need to stress that the game is Unfinished. It is clunky and rough around the edges (In addition to it being expensive for what it currently offers.)\nBut that should be expected from any Early Access title available on Steam. Do not buy this game expecting a finished product filled with content, because you wont find that here.\n\nIf you are fan of Warmachine and don't mind playing an unfinished and work-in-progress game, in addition to paying quite a bit for it, I can safely say you will enjoy Warmachine: Tactics. However if you aren't feeling the urge to immediately play it, you wont miss out on much by waiting for the full release and a cheaper price.\n\nIf you are less experienced about Warmachine, I again recommend you look it up properly before you make your purchase, else perhaps wait until the finished game is released, and along with it a lower price tag.","July 18, 2014","true","61.8"," 23 of 38 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","23","38","0","0"

You will maybe like it.\n\nFor everyone who is playing tactic games: Don't even think about it!\n\nThere are many reasons for it (sorry, I'm working as a QA in the gaming industry and maybe I found more things, where somebody else would say: Come on? Really? The game is fine for me, it doesn't bother me that much!). So here we start:\n1. You can't choose any other language, it's only in english. Not really a problem for me, but even Games for 5€ like "Knights of Pen and Paper" got more language packages. Even subtitle would be fair enough for people who don't speak english.\n2.

Not even once, or move their lips.\n3. A part of the second one, is the 3rd crap... You got 3D-Models and they do nothing? oO All videos are like this. 3D-Models standing on the same position, camera is moving around/switching positions, but the whole situation is static! It's like you looking at Barbie and Ken standing there and you listen only to voices. This is so epic...\n4. Gameplay / Control settings... OMG, this isn't only the 4th reason... There are so many issues... Didn't they gave it to someone else who just said:"Rly? Who would play like this?", or they said:"I can handle it, it's fine for me, bring it on!"\n4a. The camera moving, it's fine with the keyboard, if you get into a curvy level with alleys... it will drives you crazy, of switching the fews.\n4b. Camera again, but this time the "Enemies Turn" -.- You always... RLY F***ING ALWAYS!!!!!! Move back to your champ... This means... (camera view) The enemy make one move... The camera switch back to your champ... (camera view) The enemy attacks... The camera switch back to your champ... and it's all the time like THIS! After a match of 30mins, you are getting crazy!\n4c. If you didn't played the TG-Version, you are confused after the tutorial. Well, not really confused, but in my opinion, when you played a tactic-game you can move your characters to covering position and when you got some movement points left, let your character defend/attack when an enemie is in the line of sight. Here is only "Done" the option.\n4c. Choosing another target. You get missions, where you have to destroy mission objectives. "You played the tutorial? Yes. You see all the overload of informations? Yes. You can attack the objectiv? No. Did you saw the little buttons with "Next"? No... F***!" and it is like I said. You got massive buttons to do something, an overload of informations and two little buttons for "Next" to choose another target.\n4d. Combined attacks for example is one of the features, where you first don't know what the hell you got to do. Till you found out, you don't even need another character, no. When you combined it, with the characters who are able to do so, it happens nothing... Till you click again on one of these characters to double-ok-lets-this-finally-finally-finally-finally... It feels like: You want to uninstall it? Are you sure? Are you sure? Are you sure? Are you sure? Are you sure? Are you sure? Are you sure? Are you sure? Are you sure? Are you sure? Are you sure?\n4e. No automatic-"End Round"?! oO... What the hell... You made your moves, you can't do anything... after 10sec you realized, you didn't click the "End Round"-Button.\n4f. Why you need to show a timer, how long the AI need and you needed for your turn? Who cares? When you put a time-mission into it, make a counter and stop it, when the AI make his turn...\n5. Clipping bugs... When you got a curvey level with many alleys, you will hate this level so much. Mostly you don't see anything, cause the automatic camera moves into houses/hills/etc, so you can see everything inside the houses/hills/etc, but not what happen outside of it...\n6. Sound bugs -.- I'm playing with a headset. Mostly I get shocked of a massive, but short sound interrupt from nowhere. You done a mission and befor the "intro" for the next mission starts you got a short sound-queue of the winning sound for 1-2 seconds, which is so loud, it will blow you up sometimes. ;)\n\nTo conclude:\nYou might got some fun, if you are a TG-Player. If you "only" like tactic-games and played some others befor, you won't be satisfied. There are too many things which will make you so angry and you will ask yourself, which person decided this and if this person really was the right one for this job, cause even a reta** wouldn't do this.\nThey got really nice ideas, but only ideas... So many companies try to reinvent the wheel. Cause they wanna be someone. Games are for gamers and not for a Product Director, or a Game Designer. You want the people like your game? Make easy controls, put some lifeblood inside, stand behind your project and when you be really cool, invite 10-20 people to play that game WITH NO INTERRUPT! And see what they do!\nWell, I'm out... I will try to continue this game, when I'm so bored and really got nothing else to do and even to do nothing would be bored.","January 29, 2015","false","1.3"," 15 of 23 people (65%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","65","15","23","2","1"

The optimization is lacking a bit as the frame rates will be surprisingly low on high settings for rather powerful computers. That being said, the system flows very well, it is very pretty for a turn based strategy game, and if you enjoy the Iron Kingdoms lore, it is very hard not to enjoy the game.

I realize there are many fans of the Warmachine franchise that play the table top game and may differ in what they are looking for. I had no clue what to expect, have never played this game in any capacity (VG or TT), that said, this is one heck of a turn-based strategy game. I love TBS games, X-COM, Jagged Alliance etc., so for me, this is absolutely perfect. I was able to pick up the rules relatively quickly, there are a few warlock spells and such I'm still trying to get the hang of, though overall I feel it's very adaptive and natural to play if you give it the chance. I can't say enough good things about the game, it definitely needs to be refined and optimized more, though I haven't had a single issue with it, no crashes or stability issues (sound sometimes intermittently stops for no reason, talking like for 1/16th of a second, though it's noticeable). The current six different sides (with Merc and Scyrah expansions) are all unique and offer something different, plan to get the expansion: The Retribution of Scyrah and hope to see Convergence of Cyriss added at some point. The game had me interested so checked out Privateer press and noticed some amazing units in the gallery and an additional faction. Khador is fantastic to play with, easily my favorite. Definitely recommend this game to any fans of TBS games, this is a rich world similar to Warhammer, really enjoying it!

While the designers attempts to capture the feel of Warmachine are admirable they fall short. Some abilities had to be changed or altered and this is understandable. Feora's feat doesn't function correctly at all. The changes to make infantry are interesting however the execution fails especially with weapon master models. The scenario modes all lack kill box which is a pain when you are already playing with a shortened unit list. I had one game where a Knight Errant walked up and hit The Avatar for 18 damage with a critical. Speaking of which the randomization doesn't seem random. There are streaks where you will miss frequently and then only get critical hits after that. My dice are more average then the random number generator and I rolled 7 sets of snake eyes in a single 50 point game at Lock&Load this year. The maps lack terrain and you don't get to see your opponents deployment if you are player 2.\n\nNegatives\n- Warjacks don't have systems\n- Weapon ranges are messed up\n- No counter deploy\n- Lack of terrain\n- No kill box (screw you Severius)\n- Feora's feat doesn't function correctly (I'm sure there are other issues but really?)\n- 3 Weapon Master Infantry will drop Avatar with criticals\n- When you boost a spray all to hit rolls seem to be boosted with a single focus\n- Limited by using a grid system (you lose so much finesse with the placement of things)\n- You can't cast a spell then fail a charge for extra movement\n- Star system is janky as hell, opaque, and demonstrates a failure to understand Warmachine.\n--Using the numbers from Warmachine would at least make sense as it is math. The star system isn't consistent as it bins certain numbers together. i.e. def 16-18 may all be 4 stars\n-Criticals in general, everything can critical\n-The FAQ and manual are useless, go lose some quick match games and you can slowly figure out how things work by losing\n- In general I feel like the designers took Warmachine and tried to make it their own version while tossing away an already solid system for something they came up with while drinking one night. People have spoken with them at conventions and during early access about the star system and other things. The designers answer was a fairly condescending "Trust us, we are game designers." You should just code the existing game, not hack it to pieces.\n\n-Pros\n\n-Nice idea to change infantry over (I still feel it was unnecessary to alter the game this much)\n-Animated warcasters! Seriously this is probably the second best thing\n- Best thing is you get to play a story in the Warmachine universe\n\nTL;DR Can't recommend, Won't recommend, Disappointed Kickstarter as we were promised warmachine on the computer and we got poop.\n\nedited some spelling typos.","June 8, 2015","false","7.7"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","8","10","0","0"

The developers had enought time to fix some major bucks or design flaws, but they didn't. Performance issues are still at hand: if your game kept running  for a respectable amount of time without a crash, than that just means a crash is a soon-to-be occasion. Not a "possible" occasion, a crash -will- occure. The UI is quite obnoxious, but usable, and keeps looking like a developing kit.\n\nFor Lover's of the tabletop: Yes, it is nice to see some of your beloved units, 'jacks and 'casters moving, but that depends on the FPS rate at which you stop talking about movement. Same goes for the cutscenes betwen the missions of the No Mans Land campaign: they are more like the stills with subtitles on a classic Nintendo game, but with sound/voiceacting. The Nintendo would've had sound, if the system could've done it. The PC/Mac System could handle motion...\n\nBut back to the issue for people coming from the Tabletop: Its not a good representation of the game you know. It has a good number of similarities, yes, but sadly just enough to make you wonder (or in case of a backer: shake your head out of utter lack of understanding) why they didn't designed the game as closeley as possible to it. From a lackluster point system to represent the ability scores of your army to a just as bad changed scale of for the hitpoints.\n\nNever dream of seeing a Trencher act in a concert with 5-9 fellow unit members. He's just a solo with massivly boosted hitpoints, to keep large numbers of grunts out of the game, because "the engine could not handle that". That leads to a things like AoE's being of more than maginal value against, well, anything, because they were designed to benefit from te existence of single-wound infantry or low HP medium Infanty. Quite easy to see the error here. Well, wrong engine then, I would say...\n\nKeep in mind how the game is named: WARMACHINE: Tactics. Warmachines. That are, to my understanding, the Warjacks, the defining feature and a great bit of the appeal the whole system has to most of its fans. It's steam-powerd fantasy. The Trencher is not steampowerd, the Ironclad is. And the Warjack didn't get the same treatment of powerscale adjustment the units got, which lead to funny things like 3-4 mechanithralls ruining a warjacks day.\n\nTo my dispair, as much as I like Kickstarter and as much as i cheered for WMD to take the challenge of creating a video game adaption for warmachine, I think Kickstarter allowed WMD to get through with what they tried the first time they started developing for Warmachine: taking a bite way to big for their mouth, trying to design something that's way too large for them, playing in the big league while not able to hold the bat straight.\n\nW:T has potential, much of it, but I can't quite see the nurturing enviroment developing it needs to flourish.","June 7, 2015","false","124.6"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","0"

It is. But aside from that, Warmachine Tactics is a turn-based tile map strategy RPG set in the Iron Kingdoms world, and seems to be loosely based on the tabletop game of the same name. Even at this early beta stage, the game is showing a lot of polish and in the new and work-in-progress Unreal 4 Engine itself, runs fairly well. I was able to maintain 25-35FPS in the midrange settings. I have no doubt that this game will run like hot butter when it's optimisation is completed.\n\nThe game is very pretty, and the range of spells available between Warcasters, Warjacks and Infantry bring pretty interesting gameplay. However my initial impression of the 'direction' facing mechanic is that it is somewhat obtuse, but after some playing you get used to it. One of the things that also frustrated me some was that when you being taking actions with a unit, you can't 'save' actions for later in your turn. You must complete all possible actions or end that unit's turn in order to take action with another unit. That being said, the one single player scenario available in game is a lot of fun, and when it was completed I was only left with excitement for the next piece.\n\nClosing this up, my only regret is that I don't have more time to play it RIGHT NOW. It IS a little bit prohibitively priced, but with the extras you get when the game goes into full release I'd say it's probably worth it. This is how Early Access should be done, and even in it's early beta state, with pretty solid gameplay I must give this game an 8/10.","July 16, 2014","true","4.9"," 26 of 45 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","26","45","0","0"

Game play wise it's closer to the new XCOM than Mordheim and I actually appreciate being able to select what units move and when. Camera control is better than XCOM 2 as well (yeah I'm aware you can dl free camera mods, but it's nice that the thought was put in right out of the box here and I won't be corrupting my savegames just to enjoy the privilege). Everything is a little rougher than a triple A title to be sure (and arrg there's a little too much bloom on everything) but there's still a lot of slick animations (mantling for instance). Dunno if I'd be happy to pay 20 dollars for it yet, i got it from the humble bundle after all. I just thought I'd write my review to weight in on a few things.\n\nMost of the critical reviews have nothing to do with the game itself. More than half are protests about dlc policy. A large portion of the remaining critical reviews are are outdated, there are complaints the game doesn't run well but i'm on a mid-tier system and even with everything but lens flare on "Awesome" settings I'm getting some crazy-stupid high frame rates without the fans kicking up to jet engine levels or the celcius climbing.\n\nAs for my thoughts on the actual game? The tactical combat itself seems excellent and looks to have a lot of solid systems in place. I particularly like the allocation system because it requires you to make a judgement call, examining the feild in advance to determine whether the warcaster or warjack is going to do you more good this round at the start of your turn, which calls for a bit of a tactical appraisal and a bit of gambling. I also like the ability to spend focus to improve accuracy. I can't recall a turn-based strategy game I've played since Jagged Alliance 2 that let me do something like that and it's been sorely missed.\n\nSince it is reminiscent of XCOM I should probably make a few comparisons about differences since a lot of people will be familiar with that system. While you can select what order you want your units to move in, once you use part of a unit's moves here you have to use all of that unit's moves up at that time or forfeit them. It takes some getting used to but focus can be used to make the system flexible at least. A UI feedback addition I particularly like is that when you're planning to move a unit, visible lines of sight are drawn from the potential location to any potential targets as you hover over the tiles. How many times in XCOM2 have I been shown the damned little targeting icon only to find out I'm illogically not able to hit the target I wanted to hit or once I've moved to that spot I'm not allowed to target any units at all, even though I was told beforehand I would be? Not a problem here, if moving one square over would block my LOS, the line vanishes and you know before you commit. Also you can play the game with any controller if you so please,  though the movement cursor zips around so fast (and the sensitivity is not adjustable) that you might just opt to use a keyboard and mouse even if pads are your thing. The option is still there though.\n\nMaybe it's a matter of not coming into this review with any grudges over kickstarter this or DLC that (and the price of entry I paid can't hurt) but I'm actually enjoying this game quite a bit so I think I'll recommend it.","April 11","true","2.4"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

This is a faithful reproduction of the tabel top game. The factions are currently limited to 5 or 6 so differnt units and 1 Warcaster which is a long way away from the 50 or so in the table top game. Having said that there have been weekly updates which introduce knew units. So for instance tommorow there are knew warjacks being released for each faction. The look of the units and the quality of the graphics could not be better.\n\nEven in this beta version I would very much recomend this to anyone who is familiar with the tabletop game. I think this is pioneering work being done by Privateer Press and £37 is not much money  to support this, and certainly nothing in comparrison to collecting and painting the figures outside of the virtual environment.\n\nFor those not familiar with the game but interested, there is no better way to learn than playing the beta and being forced to  use just a handfull of units. The alternative is to wait for the full release and instead be faced with the daunting prospect of learning and understanding 100+ units with 1000s of combinations in what I think will be a competitive scene.\n\nI give this game a big thumbs up and think and hope  it will be a huge success.","July 28, 2014","true","95.7"," 17 of 28 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","17","28","0","0"

The systems and gameplay are all there and work great- it's very fun to play. But the UI and controls/camera feel like absolute ♥♥♥♥.

If you absolutely love the idea or love Warmachine then I would heartily recommend the game. It's fun and works well, but the devs are still actively fixing and optimizing things to work better. Hopefully within a few months there will be a UI overhaul or at least they will tighten up a few loose ends here and there.\n\nIt's a great game but it may be worth holding off for a while longer. If you think you can stomach the difficulties of actually controlling the game itself then by all means jump right in.\n\nDon't be alarmed by the amount of DLC either.

Overall, the game is quite tactical as promised and the combat looks and feels visceral. Since it is still in beta, I will not comment of the bugs, lack of all playable features, etc. since that is to be expected from any beta. It is still too early to judge the single player storyline too. The gameplay, multiplayer-wise, is already quite fantastic even in beta.\n\nI have 3 concerns. First, it is for a very high end computer. It barely runs on any computers from 3 years ago or older, especially laptops. I have confirmed this on a number of computers from the pre-2011 lineups. On lowest settings, I run at 3-4 fps. Don't expect to get any higher than 20 fps unless you bought the computer in the last two years with a mid-to-high-range (at the time) graphics card. Surprisingly high requirements should bar a good numbers of players, expecially at a time when PC/laptop sales are in a historic freefall.\n\nAlso, there are specific issues for the two major groups of players: those familiar with the tabletop game and those who aren't.For those who are familiar, they may be very turned off by the rules changes from the table top, namely that the units of infantry are much smaller in number and thus scaled so each infantry is considerably more powerful than the tabletop version. For those who aren't familiar, the price for the game on Steam, particularly for the digital deluxe, seems a bit of a gamble. If they aren't certain they will like the game's universe, that is asking for a lot. Thus, both groups face a major downside with the purchase of the game. I wish they at least catered to one of the groups, preferably the tabletop fans, who probably backed their kickstarter with capital already.","September 24, 2014","true","4.5"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

It's been more than a year and a half since the game was released and despite all the patches there has been no real improvement to the fundamental problems.\n\nThe UI is a clunky and obtuse mess.  Simple tasks are needlessly complicated to the point that it can be difficult to tell if a bug has occured or if, for example: the character isn't moving because the UI is in some state that precludes moving.  Even just cycling through characters can be difficult.  Hit 'tab', nothing happens, end turn: "You still have characters with actions left".  Hit 'tab' again and they select.\n\nWith a little thought Warmachine could have been an X-Com competitor.  Add a few context sensitive menus and a bit of object picking to the mouse and do away with the awful stateful button menus.  The entry to making an attack shouldn't be deciding you'll make a ranged attack before deciding which enemy you're going to make the ranged attack on.  The default enemy chosen when ranged attacking is usually not meaningful.  Let me select the enemy and then select what I want to do to them.\n\nRather than popping up hints on how to calculate the various 'things' let me hover the mouse over something and show me the modifiers for it.  An obvious reason for why I can't exit a characters turn would be helpful too.  It feels like no effort has been put into user interaction at all; there are problems all the way from the blurred and stretched fonts to the poor - and largely absent - presentation of what's going on on the battlefield: who still has abilities left, what abilities, which enemies etc...  It's all really bad.\n\nCouple the UI with poor voice acting, poor writing, unfinished cut-scenes, a host of bugs  and some dodgy AI and you're left a game that looks nice in screenshots but is almost painful to play.\n\nSpend your time elsewhere, play X-Com or Fallen or Divinity or anything else instead.","April 10","false","4.1"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

On the upside it is pretty and fun to look at with an engaging story and when the controls cooperate the game really seems to come together.\n\nCONS.\n1) Clunky and touchy controls.\n\nThe controls at first seem pretty straighforward until you try and use them.  It can be hard to tell how you trencher or warjack will move what facing they may end up in.  Getting a unit to face the proper direction can at time be very frustrating as the controls for facing are extremely sensitive so make sure you have the arrow pointing in the right direction before you click that mouse button.  Simply point getting you units to move and do the things you want them to do can be frustrating.\n\n2) The terrain.\n\nI have noticed numerous times units moving through various terrain features on the map.  but this isn't the big issue here.  First, I cant tell what is and what isn't rough terrain.  Also your movemnt lines tend to get obscured by piles of dirt, rocks and grasses making it hard to get an idea of where your unit might end up after it moves.  I had to guess a few times and click hoping my trencher would go where I wanted him to go.  Other times the visual contrast such as line against snowy terrain make it nearly impossible to see what you are doing.\n\n3) Numerous and varied glitches\n\nFirst, most of the game breaking glitches have been ironed out.  That being said there are ALOT problems with various graphical effects and some abilities not working the way they are supposed to.  There is a bug reporting tool if you feel inclined to send the developers a note of your problems.\n\n4) The UI\n\nThe UI is takes up a little bit to much of the screen and sometimes seems to get in the way of your mouse.  Information seems to get cluttered when you have a bunch of units engaged in a giant melee making it at times rather difficult to tell what is happening at a quick glance.  The last part of this is the mini map IT STINKS! It is completely useless.\n\nCONS\n\n1) Graphics\n\nApart from some minor bugs it looks fantastics.  Nuff said\n\n2) The Story\n\nI have only played through a portion of the campaign so far at the story is engaging and fun.\n\n3) More offten the not is gells together and feels awsome\n","November 21, 2014","true","33.7"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","10","15","0","0"

In my opinion, the game is heading in a good direction, trying to keep the tabletop experience as realistic as possible. Gameplay, I'd give a 9/10. Now, for the bad stuff. The game is hardly optimized, to the point of averaging ~12fps. While I figured there was a workaround, judging from the forums, this is not the case. The other negative is that they are trying to monetize their units in a simlar manner to the tabletop version. DLC consists of a couple units here and there, or sole units. This has been done to the point where the DLC outcosts the base game. Warhammer 40k seems to have found a good route, where each expansion has the full set of units available, without microtransactions. Customization is also non-existent as of yet, and you are pretty much stuck with the base schemes for each unit.

A lot of still portraits, and in many cases, still models in cutscenes whose mouth's don't move while they talk. Various UI glitches that may force you to skip unit activations. Scripted events throughout the campaign make it less about tactics, and more about just getting through the mission. No saving mid-level (this means if you don't have at least an hour or so each mission, you are likely to lose a lot of progress if you have to stop playing).\n\nDespite all of that, there are a lot of good things about Warmachine Tactics. A unique world, setting and units based on the award winning tabletop game: WARMACHINE. The rules and interactions are very deep with many different things to consider throughout a match. There is an unlimited amount of replayability as unit selection and opponent choices make it so no two matches are exactly alike.\n\nIf you are willing to look past various annoyances in the production of the game, this title has a lot of excellent tactical wargaming to be had.

The game itself is very poorly implemented, with a clunky and primitive grid system rather than the more typical "stand where you want to" that is the industry standard for RTS games. Use of a hex system would have been better if the devs were unable to manage a non-grid. The display starts out fine, but every corpse, ability, spell and so on adds to the clutter and general poor presentation; this is amplified is the grid display is turned on (to allow counting of ranges etc), rapidly becoming a tangled mess. If there's a control-area spell or feat in operation the display is utterly useless, as it colour-fills every square the spell or feat is effecting. It gets to the point that the player cannot see where the various units are or even which ones are still alive.\n\nThis game is missing basic functionality. The game only saves between missions - there is no option for saving mid-level, even in the single player campaign. This means that the player has to dedicate around an hour minimum, solidly, to each level. Need to go out in 45 minutes? Have something else you need to get done? Your wife/child/pet etc need you for something? In that case, you're either unable to start the level or, if mid-way, have the choice between ignoring the thing you need to do or loosing all the level and re-starting later. Very poor.\n\nThe control system is clunky and can lead to gameplay problems. Changing the direction a unit is facing often snaps to the wrong direction (ie not the direction you clicked on), leaving problems such as being unable to shoot, presenting your back to the enemy or being unable to charge next turn. Lines of sight seem rather arbitrary, leaving the player guessing at who can see whom and from where.\n\nThe AI is frankly laughable. Enemy units will sit where they started unless you get close to them or shoot them, meaning most levels are simply a case of nibbling away until the enemy are all dead. There's rarely any challenge. The level design tries to compensate for this by spawning more and more enemies, including heavy warjacks, but this leads to a very unsatisfying experience.\n\nAs a port of Warmachine to the computer, the game also fails. For some reason, they've fundamentally altered most of the rules (eg Def and Arm, RAT/MAT and so on being 1-4), the feel of the game (infantry are unreasonably tough), the scale of the game (you'll have a handful of infantry and a couple of 'jacks - maybe 20 points on the tabletop) and the abilities of almost all the units. All infantry operates independently, with no units.\n\nOverall, I would call this game a failure, and give it 3/10. Do not buy.","February 27, 2015","false","24.9"," 10 of 16 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","10","16","0","1"

I'll start with some of the things I liked before I get into any of the bad things.\n\n1. The character artwork is great! I saw images of some of the mechs on zbrush central and I started looking for this game right away.\n\n2.Controlling and allocating focus to warjacks was an interesting take on a turn based tactical game like this.\n\n3. I enjoyed the combat and gameplay mechanics. There are many games with these mechanics but the theme was very interesting and exciting for me.\n\nNow I'll go into some of the things that i don't like and again please understand that I only played the demo so my experience is only limited to the 3 missions in the demo.\n\n1. The camera is messed up in the city levels. Every time I would do an attack the camera would start rotating or something around the two characters fighting and the camera would go behind the wall and I would not see the attack or how much damage i did or if i missed.\n\n2. The dialgue was really lame. and to top it off the characters apear to not have any facial rigs. When your in a cutscene with two characters talking the mouths don't move and the camera moves around like its supposed to be a movie or something. I feel they should have gone to text because it threw me off so much that their mouths were not moving. It made it look like some college students last minute project where they had a scene and characters and only had to deal with camera angles. It was so annoying because the camera would even cut to the person talking but all that was happening was the audio but nothing else. I don't know maybe its just a thing that gets on my nerves personally. it doesn't change the outcome of the game in the end so i guess it doesn't matter.\n\nI don't want to put a recommendation out because I haven't played the full game. I will however say that I will not buy this game enless its like 10 dollars. I am interested and I want to play the rest of the game, but based on some of the issues I pointed out i feel it was slapped together at some points and the Camera issues I had in the city level were unbearable. I can't wait till i goes on sale though I really want to see the rest of the Warjacks and character art.\n","March 8, 2015","true","1.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

The game is fun, but can be buggy which takes away a lot from the experience.\n\nSecond, this is not Warmachine, but closer to FF Tactics with giant robots. Be prepared for that shock if you were expecting a video game version of the tabletop game.\n\nThird, the game is not worth its full price. The first person game is fairly short (only about 20 mission) and not that inspired so far (I'm about halfway through). The vrs mode is fun but is seem like half of the models are DLC's, which is ridiculous. It feels like the game is trying to penny pinch you and they're doing a good job of it.\n\nIf you are interested in this game, wait until there is a sale where you can pick up the game and the DLC's for cheap. Otherwise, its not worth it.","June 2, 2015","true","21.6"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

It's clear the game was SUPER buggy when it first debuted in Early Access and a lot of impulse reviews were responding to that. But I played it anyway, and I was pleasantly suprised. Mind you, there are still some bugs and glitches, but the game is quite fun. Even the voice acting of the campaign characters is suprisingly good, the graphics are great (with a few bugs) and I genuinely had fun playing. It even made me more interested in considering to try out the tabletop game.\n\nIt seems virtually all the negative reviews are either about bugs in the game, or features that were late being delivered.

Familiar terms are used, but the game is fundamentally different. You are probably better off just trying to play a game an VASSAL.\n\nIf you are looking for turn-based tactical squad combat, you are better off going to play XCOM, this game is poorly optimized, still buggy, and interactions within the game are not well explained.\n\nThe price and volume of microtransactions make this game an even worse buy.\n\nI was hopeful for this game, but they strayed too far from the original mechanics, devoted a larger percentage of their time to modeling than they probably should have while under optimizing it, and even cut core concepts.\n\nI have not yet finished the campaign, but so far it feels far too much on rails and forced, what they want to happen will happen regardless of what you try to do to stop it (for story reasons). You get the units they give you, and must play according to what you are given to succeed. They don't explain things you are shown until they feel you need to know, in an early mission you are shown in-game cut-scenes of someone running around at least 2-3 times before they tell you anything about what you are seeing and why it is relevant and potentially too late for you to react. It feels like all of the events that occur are just sitting waiting for a certain turn number before it tells you about it, I was stuck on one mission waiting for a thing to occur because I'd done too well the turns before. The leveling mechanic was a great idea, but also felt very generic. I would have enjoyed earning experience on unit types and being able to customize my forces.\n\nOverall, it feels like this was wasted potential. There was a lot of money and support behind the game, but it feels like the developers went over budget in some early areas and were forced to cut back on concepts that they could no longer afford to develop, specifically lack of units, number of models on the board, size of the board and the campaign. At least I hope that is the case, because if the current product what the developers intended to make, I feel like that was not well communicated during the inital backing process.","January 28, 2015","false","44.6"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

The interface and terrain are two things that should never get in the way of functionality.\nThere are die-hard fans that will argue these points to death, but as someone who is not vested in the warmachine universe, I can say that even at the current sale price of $23.99, the game doesn't offer much of a deal.","March 21, 2015","false","52.0"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

The graphics are pretty good for a kickstarter game, some CG cutscenes would have been amazing (especially of the duel between Orsus and Sturgis) but that's really asking too much of a limited budget. The gameplay is well done, with actual thought being required so that you don't open yourself up to enemy charges or block your own movement and/or line of sight with an ill-timed activation. That's one aspect of the game I've really enjoyed so far which is good because there are a lot of minor areas that need at least a little improvement.\n\nThe bad: The story. The story is almost cringe worthy in its absolute lack of originality and, so far, bad presentation - I mean, another superweapon that could change the course of the war / end the world as we know it plot line? Really? Even the opening scene almost made me facepalm when Jakes stated that "I...I killed Commander Stugis". My reaction was no, no you didn't. I haven't even played the storyline yet and I know this, stop being a drama queen. Given the fluff available in the books I was really expecting better, even the game characters seem almost caracatures of themselves compared to their presentation in the books. There is one twist that might have been interesting but since anyone with even a nodding acquaintence with the game likely knows what happens to Stugis it's a moot point. I would have liked something more along the lines of the old Dark Omen game where your actions and decisions decided how the story progressed and what units were available.\nThe voice acting isn't bad, not great, but somewhere in the middle and they did seem to match their characters. However the pronounciation of Brisbane as Bris-bane really irritated me for some reason.\n\nSince I haven't finished the campaign yet I can't say the storyline is difinitively horrible but I'm not hopeful for a turn around though if it does happen I will edit this review.\n\nThe mediocre: A couple of small issues that will likely be fixed in future patches, the UI really needs to be adjustable with at least a scale though being able to move, fade or remove selected elements in addition would be better. Having subtitles not take up almost a third of the screen would also be nice. The cost is about average for the standard edition but considering there's a lot of DLC in the works that you'll have to buy seperately... well maybe the DLC will reasonably priced.\n\nI'd recommend this game if you're looking for something fun that will likely focus around multiplayer battles. I haven't come across many bugs at all so far, mainly just a few with speech and sound clips not playing or not playing quite right. Definetly no game breaking bugs which is great. Whatever you do you should not buy this game expecting a great or even good story but the gameplay is solid especially if you enjoy mulitplayer battles.\n","November 21, 2014","true","34.2"," 10 of 17 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","10","17","0","0"

I am not very familiar with the setting beyond hearing the name a few times in tabletop circles, but the story and world shown is execellent.  The graphics are also great for a genre where they are usually an afterthought.  I only wish the gameplay itself seemed like less of an afterthought.\n\nI have to wonder how much experience the gameplay and UI designers have with making games.  You have to manually select each unit before giving them orders instead of auto-selecting the next unit in the list.  There is also no easy way to move the camera so you can actually tell where you're moving.  While I enjoy seeing the action from almost any angle, can we include a consistent way to get an overhead view next time?  And the unit actions themselves can be confusing to navigate and are (again) inconsistent in how they are executed.  Sometimes you click a circle in the unit menu and other times you click on an enemy unit itself.  These are all pretty basic mistakes that should have been caught early on and make the game feel incomplete.\n\nThere's a great game buried in here somewhere, but it's hidden behind the terrible controls and clunky camera.","November 30, 2014","false","3.5"," 11 of 19 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","11","19","0","4"

Everything is fine and dandy IN THEORY -- until you actually try and play the game.\n\nI would probably enjoy this game if it weren't for the UTTERLY HORRIBLE user interface. This is much worse than XCOM's designed for consoles ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t UI. It never does what you expect it to, and relies on some antediluvian interface design concepts like having large number of buttons on the screen you need to press to do anything. I can't even select unit, de-select it to select another and then re-select it again, as it somehows expects that I'm done with him or something. Really?! Something wrong with just using a minimized mouse-driven UI with context-sensitive actions, maybe context-sensitive menus, simple action point system that stops predicting what the player is trying to do, like when he's done with a unit, whom to attack and so on, and just let the player do anything he wants with minimum effort. Too much?\n\nIf you're a game designer or want to be one, please do play this game and take notes on how to NOT design your UI and inputs.\n\n+ I like the free camera, once you toggle it on (kind of confusing to mention those free camera controls in tutorial since it's by default toggled off). Too many games restrict me to their idea of ideal camera angle, which is usually wrong.","February 21, 2015","false","0.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The characters are fine, the setting awesome, but there are just Too many noob mistakes and game breaking bugs to recommend it to anyone but the most avid fan of the Warmachine miniatures game.\nMuch of the time it feels like you're trying to force the game to behave more than thinking tactically. This is due to a series of major annoyances:\n- The 3d engine cannot seem to understand which square you're pointing at, making you constantly 'misclick' and have your troops move to a wrong square, which can cost you the game if someone you need buys it to a free strike\n- Free strikes, while we're on it, do not seem to follow the same rules for the player and the ai.\n- When moving, the trooper will often turn to a random facing after finishing the move, which looks hilarious at first - the tropper dashes over barrels and walls, then turns around as if pleased with his little hurdles run, but is soon annoying as hell when you have to spend time turning all your troopers back to face the enemy after moving.\n- The game rules are explained only in a rudimentory sense, making it near impossible for a person who hasn't played the miniatures game to understand, and is then changed in arbitrary ways. Since when does a Bastion have a charge move longer than the range of a Trencher's rifle? Why no hit locations, systems to disable on jacks? And infantry have Lots of boxes, while jacks have not been significantly boosted.\n- Line of sight does not take object height into account; a jack cannot shoot over the heads of infantry. And it seems that if any los possible crosses a square with a friendly trooper, there's no los.\n- Scenarios feel forced; there seems to be little to no room to actually Play here; you pretty much have to solve the problem the developers want you to, or fail, to the point where overwhelming forces are put in to push you as fast as possible this way or that. And not reading the mind of the developers correctly the very first time Will cost you the fight.\n- No save. Which makes the next problem even worse:\n- The games take a Long time; a fight often takes over an hour even if you fail pretty fast, and I've yet to play one that could be completed in under 1½. This is Way Too Much Time, and feels very unnecesary.\n\nAll in all, I am sorely disappointed. There is still hope, but this one needs Major fixes.","April 12, 2015","false","12.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I enjoy turn based strategy and I really like the Warmachine ethos and concept. However I cannot recommend this game yet because the user interface is the\n\nCLUNKIEST GAME INTERFACE SINCE GAMES WERE PLAYED ON STONE TABLETS!\n\nSeriously this is almost unplayable! Whever play tested this for the developers must have had some kind of deal with a rival firm because there is no way this should have passed testing. It's not the size of the UI or the fact that the units move on a square grid (these are pretty much the same as XCOM and that gameplay is excellent) it's just the fact that it will often not register what the player is doing. Trying to change the facing of your units is best guess because often the arrow pointer just wont follow the mouse direction so you just press excecute hoping that the 25% chance you have of getting the orientation you want will come out. Also whilst the units move on a grid the curser option does not and so it is often pot luck which of the available squares your unit will move to. This could all be fixed witha  decent patch but it needs to happen before the game can be played.\n\nOn another topic buildings block the camera and so unless you are playing on an empty map you can't get the camera into a position where you can accurately see what is going on. The entire second campaign mission is played through narrow streets and no matter where you place the camera it is trying to look over a wall. This can make the UI even more infuriating as you try to wrestle with the camera to get it to look at the squares you want only to find that the UI has frozen your unit so it can only move in the opposite direction!\n\nThe other thing I noticed is that the game can be very tight lipped sometimes about which unit you should be using. If you have a unit that hasn't completed it's action you can't select the next unit even if all you can do with the previous one is end it's action but it often won't tell you which unit you should be selecting. This is likely something that will come with practice and as I said I only played the demo so maybe it is something I will get used to in time.\n\nAs I said at the beginning I did enjoy the missions I played of this and I am going to keep it in my wishlist but until they patch the UI and camera I certainly won't be spending any money on this and I suggest you don't either.","February 22, 2015","false","1.6"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Small details that iron out rough edges, but still leaving large flaws that run through the game.\n\nBarring a severe overhaul of the game on every level, I still say to pick up the demo of the game and see how you feel with that, Otherwise, behave like there's still an 'Early Access' banner on the page.\n\n----- Original Review ----\n\nDespite what the site says, despite what the people promoting the game may say.... this game is still deserving of the term 'Early Access'...

The controls are not intuitive and allows for background items like trees to block your ability to interract with the maps.  Occasionally a click to a specific square will instead rocket your selected unit across the map somewhere else.\n\nThe part that is most frustrating was that during the time the game was being developed and kickstarted requirements, while never confirmed, were said to be within the normal performance for games of these era.  Guild Wars 2 at full effects or FFXIV: ARR, no problem on my system.  Warmachine Tactics however ends it.  Its been 7 months with only minimal improvement on the stability end.\n\nIf you have a modern gaming rig (8gb Ram, 3+ ghz quadcore processor, NVidia 900 series, etc) then by all means play the game.

It was incomplete, buggy and not very well optimised. The majority of the negative reviews seem to focus on this.\n\nHowever - I would say it has come on in leaps and bounds since then.\n\nI backed the Kickstarter though I hadn't heard of Warmachine, let alone played the table top game, I like turn-based games and liked the sound of the theme.  When I first got access to it, all the points I touched on in my first paragraph left me frustrated, So I stopped playing it for a while, now though coming back to it, I've found it so much more enjoyable.\n\nWhiteMoonDreams have added a ton of content and have been releasing fixes and updates on a regular basis.\n\nThe focus of the game, and subsequently the development, is on the Multiplayer which means that the Campaign is still lacking -The AI is basic and doesn't offer much of a challenge (this is slated for improvement in the future). The same can be said for Skirmish - however it's a good place to test out a list or a new tactic, albeit whihtout a sensible response from the opponent, before trying it in Multiplayer. My point here is that if you are more interested in the Campaign than the Multiplayer, you'll be disappointed.\n\nA Multiplayer (with limited unit selection) demo has just been released - it allows play against existing players as well as other demo users. I'd suggest giving it a try.\n\nThe next feature that I am most waiting for is asynchronous play - being able to take a turn at a time when I can fit in 10 minutes without necessarily having to be online at the same time as my opponent will be great for me. By that time I also expect lots more fixes and improvements. I'll probably come back to this review at that point and give some more thoughts.","February 20, 2015","true","292.1"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

Its features were heavily limited, it was full of bugs, and it was poorly optimised- all things you'd expect from an Early Access game.\n\nIn the following months, the developers have shown that they care about both the game and the community- almost everything has been fixed in weekly patches, features have been implemented at an impressive rate, and a huge amount of our suggestions have been taken on board. For a debut game from a new studio, I'm mightily impressed.\n\nWarmachine: Tactics, as with the tabletop Warmachine, is about clever army construction, positioning, patience, ruthlessness, brutality and keeping your cool. A warcaster defines how his army functions, so the same list can play very differently with the change of a single unit, and there are currently around a dozen units and four warcasters for each faction, so there's a huge amount of customisation possible.\n\nIf you've ever lost an evening to a turn-based tactical game, then I can recommend this.\n\nAs for downsides? The UI could use a little work and Mac performance is a little wonky, but there's nothing gamebreaking. The learning curve is steep if you've never played Warmachine, but you'll be rewarded if you persevere.\n\n\n\nTL; DR: Wizards with guns throw robots at each other. 9/10","December 17, 2014","true","207.5"," 13 of 24 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","13","24","0","0"

Of course, this is early access or whatever you want to call it so there are a few bugs and the game isn't polished - the AI is very unpredictable and broken, the RNG is often massively frustrating, graphics are a bit flickery and so on - but the core is pretty solid.\n\nI play the tabletop game and I can say for sure that although this isn't a 100% rule-for-rule stat-for-stat remake of the tabletop game, it captures the spirit of it very well. A few things are different here and there and a few of the most popular units in the tabletop game are unfortunately missing (Though, with the promise of paid-for (boo!) additional units and characters later) but overall it's pretty faithful to the spirit of the actual game.\n\nThe only thing that's not faithful to the spirit of the game is the very stingy microtransaction system that's being talked about. That's much more something I'd associate with Games Workshop than Privateer Press who are usually very good about being very inclusive with what you spend money. A bit of a shame but I suppose that's the age of gaming we live in. I will say that a Microtransaction system which will include characters and units, not just cosmetic items, is not something I would have expected to see in a Crowdfunded game and is not in the spirit of crowfunding.\n\nTL;DR - Game is good.

There are still a whole lot of weird problems such as:\n-Inability to see your movement grid in the snow.\n-The camera. Cant see units on the other side of walls, controls weird.\n-UI is akward.\n-Story scenes feel lazy. (Stationary character models with voiceover)\n-Selecting troops is a chore due to its unresponsiveness.\n-Misspelling in the Campaign and Tutorial sections...(really)\n-Dumb AI\nThat said, The game actually looks really cool. The environments and models are just fun to look at. And if youre a fan of the tabletop game like myself, just seeing your favorite models come to life is awesome! Even now the game is still fun to play and If the controls were more responsive, the game would be a blast.\nThe Devs do listen to these complaints and have said that they are fixing some of these problems.  In the future, I believe a lot of this stuff is going to get worked out. I believe in this game and I am going to stick with it. I really want to recomend this game, I Just dont think this is currently "Full release" quality.","April 8, 2015","false","12.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

A focus on smaller skirmishes as opposed to the large sclae battles seen on a tabletop has the potiential for an interesting game.\n\nWhere everything falls apart however is the UI. It is so clunky, so user-unfriendly that it borders on ridiculous. Having to fiddle with a units facing just to get it to look in the correct direction as the thing you want it to kill, and then take 3-4 clicks from there just to make your attack feels frustrating and takes absolutely forever. Movement is a chore, having to constantly rotate the camera so that you can click the exact spot you want to move to, because a small rock was blocking it from vision, and hope to god you don't misclick anything and send your unit off in the wrong direction, with no option to undo (Which can happen freuquently because...) Selecting units is a huge pain. You can of course click on their name in your army list on the side of the screen... which is hidden from view most of the time while controlling a unit, or you can click the actual unit, which is as fiddly as it gets, if you accidentally select the wrong unit, you can proceed to accidentally move it where you didn't want it to go as you try to pick the right one.\n\nUltimately, Warmachine: Tactics is a game that could be great, it just needs more time and polish than even devoted fans are willing to give it.","February 17","false","2.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I mean dont get me wrong it's still somewhat enjoyable, but that is mostly due to the fact that its Warmachine. The demo is suffering from so many technicial issues and its REALLY obvious that the devs bit of more than they could chew and that the game would have needed at least another year to be properly polished and done. The sound is just horrible, badly mixed annoyingly loud and everything sounds as if the source of it is directly in your brain. The textures are really poor and low res (especially the environment) and often dont load properly and the framerates are fairly inconsistent. The hud often bugs out, units turn 180° arround although you specifically ordered them not to and they didnt even bother to animate the "cutscenes". Its just some horrible dialouge and standing modells, and the worst part was that you had to sit through the entire thing. Several times if you blew the missions, which happened rather frequently because the game often doesnt properly tell you what it wants you to do, and since there isnt even a save feature (in 2016!) youd be forced to do the entire thing all over again. What really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off tho was the fact, that they are trying to sell you the missing factions via DLC when the core game is still this broken and bugy. Guess they recocnised that they would not be able to finish it and just wanted to make some cash on their way out (thats propably why they put it up in the humble bundle). Oh and the hit chances are just plain broken, I have the feeling that i fail at least 50-60% of the standard 74-75%er Attacks. Damn the longer I play the more BS I find. So apparently you fail basically every mission if anything that isnt a proper line man dies, and since it only takes a lucky crit to kill the solos you have even more chances to watch the beautifully "animated' cutscenes","March 10","false","5.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

And then they said "now make a list of everything we could do better using a computer than a table top game".  and then they took those lists, and put them into one list and said "don't put any of these things in the final game".\n\nThey have masterfully combined a tabletop game with a computer game and somehow managed to take only the worst aspects of both, carefully dodging any positive aspect they might have accidentally picked up.  In fact, they did such a good job making the game terrible I think they might have gone the extra mile and made lists of everything they could make worse from the table top game.  And then they had a brainstorming session of ways they could make you less satisfied with your time.\n\nTim:  "You know how the miniatures game has you take turns because its really hard to simulate simultaneous movement in a miniatures game?\n\nGreg:  "yeah, sometimes playing that game I wish there was a way to streamline that process so both players could have less time simply waiting for the other player to move"\n\nTim: "and you know how since we have computers that can simply work everything out accurately and in real time we could simply get rid of that problem?"\n\nGreg: "... yes?  where are you going with this Tim?..."\n\nTim: "well I think we should not do that.  Lets keep it turn based so that players don't have to deal with enjoying the exciting combat"\n\nGreg:  "genius!"\n\nTim:  "And not only that, but this way we can give all the characters completely static animations and have them stand perfectly still almost 95% of the time"\n\nGreg:  "fantastic idea!  Having good graphics and smooth animations might allow players to become immersed in the game.  This way is much better, there is almost no chance players will feel any excitement during a battle"\n\nTim: "exactly!  It is definitely best to avoid capitalizing on the fact that since this is a computer game we could actually render out the battles instead of having the players imagine them like in the mini war game"\n\nBob: "oh hey guys, I just wanted to share my idea that for the opening cinematic we could have the characters talk about really exciting battles and interesting plot events"\n\nGreg: "I dunno Bob, that sounds a little to interesting for what we are trying to make here"\n\nBob: " but thats just it, we wont ever actually show what they are talking about.  It will be a huge entirely empty room in which two characters discuss interesting events that the player doesnt ever get shown"\n\nTim: "good idea Bob, we could even go a step further by not bothering to animate the characters mouths and not giving them any interesting body anguage at all"\n\nGreg:  "If we play this right we can take something that might have once been interesting and gotten the players excited to play our game and instead make it into a boring lecture that feels like it lasts for years"\n\nTim:  "hey bob, this is a turn-based skirmish level tactical strategy game which is almost exactly the same as the table top game, even using almost the same dice system"\n\nBob: "yeah..."\n\nTim: "well maybe we should consider changing the type of game slightly since the only people who are likely to get into this game already are invested in a better version of the same exact game?"\n\nBob:"...."\n\nGreg:"..."\n\nTim: "BWAHHAHAHAHAA oh my god I really had you guys going there"\n\nBob: "Hehehe you sure are a joker there Tim"\n\nGreg: "oh man thats a good one!  The game might have actually had a purpose if we did something crazy like that"\n\nTim: "for real though I think we should take it a step down even from the table top game and set everything on a grid"\n\nBob: "Tim, you always know how to suck the life and joy out of everything"\n\nTim: "aww you're flattering me "\n\nJeff: "hey guys"\n\nGreg: "[sigh] what is it now, Jeff?"\n\nJeff: "well its just that I looked at that old E3 demo where it was sort of a tactical third person skill based hack and slash with elements of strategy, third person shooter, and squad commanding/building.  It really seemed like a good way to let the players experience the 'no holds barred iron fury' warmachine is all about.  and whats great about it too is that this is a totally diferent perspective on the iron kingdoms that would be inviting to new players, perfect for people already into privateer press games, and not compete directly with the-"\n\nTim:  "shut up Jeff."\n\nGreg: "nobody likes you"\n\nBob: "please leave, we need to push this product out with almost no actual advertising now"\n\nTim: "wait hold on, we cant put this out in this shape.

Whoever decided to reduce damage while increasing unit health and completely eviscerating the warjack damage table should be hung.\n\nUI blows chunks whenever you try to do anything remotely like clicking a button and the AI is neither artificial, nor intelligent, id est, natural stupidity.\n\nIf you're bored to death of banging your head against a wall for lack of anything better, feel free to waste your money on this game for the cheap thrill of building a walking wall of artillery.

I, however, was one of the people who bought the Humble Bundle so yes, I am that cheap but I am also a uni student and hence, broke 80% of the time. Now this game was a mixed bag for me. I love the steampunk aesthetic and the units look amazing, the animations are very well done (slight clipping aside), all in all, the game is visually solid.\n\nI played this game once before I actually owned it, there was actually a big chunk of time between trying it and buying it. When I tried it, there was one thing that really get on my nerves and that was, the game ran like ♥♥♥♥. You'll be glad to know that after buying and playing it, it no longer had that problem. The game runs great.\n\nSo I've already given a few pros to the game, now I'm going to present some cons.\n\nThe first and foremost, the UI sucks. There's a lot of things on the screen at once, a lot of numbers and different sections of the UI. There's a part of the UI that tells you the stats of the currently selected unit, if I actually played the game more seriously, I would've found it useful, instead I ignored it because it was ugly along with the rest of the UI. Useful but ugly. I ended up playing a couple games vs the AI without even looking at that part of the screen so it was basically steampunk XCOM at that point.\n\nThat brings me to my next point, I played against the AI a few times after completing the tutorial. To put it simply, the AI is moronic at best. I won one game vs the red faction (whatever they're called, they had three hard-hitting mechs/warjacks), due to the fact that the enemy warcaster charged ahead of the rest of his squad and proceeded to get wrecked by my two warjacks and the rest of my squad. Anyway, it is what it is. You can exploit the imbecilic AI to learn the units in your chosen faction and learn about other factions as well. Other than that, there's no reason to play against them because they play like a human with a few extra chromosomes.\n\nI've heard the camera does weird things sometimes, from my experience, it happens every now and then, not everytime.\n\nHere's a major gripe that a lot of people had about the campaign/story mode. The characters' lips don't move when they're talking. While the complaints aren't necessarily wrong, they made some odd decisions which didn't help it. If the cutscenes don't show the characters' mouths actually moving, then they should've done it either the characters don't move at all so kind of like a comic book style where it's basically a picture rendered in 3D or have an actual drawing. Instead, the characters are moving about, swaying, breathing while their lips aren't moving and it looks...amateur to be honest.\n\nHere's the real kick in the teeth with this game. It's really fun. The game itself is great, I enjoyed the time I spent with it (albeit it's not a lot but that's what happens when you have exams). Despite all the negative points I made above, the game is really good and really fun. But you will have gripes with it. It is not by any stretch a perfect game. But it's fun.\n\nEDIT: I forgot to mention a few parts of the game.\n\nLet's just say the keybindings are really helpful once you learn them but some keys have odd placements. It's something I overlooked because I wasn't playing very seriously and used the mouse 80% of the time but I did try to use the keybindings.\n\nAlso, the game tends to punish you for choosing the wrong unit because once you select a unit, you must give it commands because if you desselect it, the unit won't be able to move. They can shoot and fight but they can't move. It's quite bad when you select your warcaster and decided that you wanted to move the warjack instead but that's fine, if I was a little strategic, I probably wouldn't have a problem with this.\n\nOne of the things I really like about the game is that when you're telling a unit to move to a certain spot, the game tells you which units are in range. It's a nice feature that allows some tactical positioning. That isn't to say that you won't miss but you know who you can shoot.","May 11","true","2.3"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

By default the graphics are set to "medium" or something, which means all characters, the terrain and the characters' portraits are extremely blurry which stands in stark contrast with the pixel-crisp GUI. The game was probably optimized for tiny screens, like 640x480 or something, as on my 1920x1080 the GUI elements are tiny and are scattered in the edges of the screen. The level minimap, for example, is smaller than a single soldier when viewed from max zoom out.\n\nEven after I set all graphical settings to maximum and restarted the game, everything was still blurry. There might be something wrong in their shaders code or whatever, but all objects are too glossy and too bright, with large spots of plain white on many objects. The tutorial text is written in huge blurry font. Tutorial messages tell about what on-screen buttons do but at the same time the whole GUI is hidden, so you don't know what they are talking about. You will stop understanding the explained game mechanics about 1/3 into the tutorial. After that you will keep clicking the highlighted areas/buttons with no clue what's going on. Obviously the developers never tested the tutorial on anyone except themselves. The cutscenes are ugly and some of them can't be skipped. E.g. I wanted to exit the game during an endless cutscene, and the dialog to confirm exiting was there, but when you press "Yes" (yes, please exit) it just hangs. This was the last straw for me.\n\nMy guess is that 90% of people who try the demo will exit it and uninstall it right after the tutorial stops showing its messages and lets you finish the first mission by yourself. Or rather, most will exit even before the tutorial shows anything, after seeing the super-blurry font.\n\nAll that said, the combat system seems to be pretty interesting (from what I could understand) and feels like something between XCOM Enemy Unknown and The Banner Saga. It's a pity that this promising system got such an atrocious implementation.","January 14","false","0.7"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

And apparently some people are trying to run the game on a toaster. Tip: your toaster will not run this game. Try a computer.\n\nHaven't suffered a single crash to desktop, did once get a freeze, but considering the state my OS is in, that's generally fine :P at least it wasn't a CtD or a blue screen.\n\nGameplay is fun, although some of the scenarios can be kinda brutal. I wouldn't say the AI is smart or dumb, but it's generally competent. Occasionally I saw it miss out on a prime charge opportunity but I think that's a part of the way their priorities are weighted - typically the AI will try and kill your warcaster rabidly and sometimes it can be a little less than defensive if you take advantage of that behaviour.\n\nBGM is majestic but unobtrusive. It's appropriate without being distracting. Ingame graphics are decent, so far no animations for cutscenes, which is a shame but I can live without. I generally enjoy the voice acting, occasional incidents of "nope, try again" but generally good and excels in some places. Not a game where I would go "THIS VA IS AMAZING" but not also one where I'd be like "CANNOT PLAY BECAUSE OF THE VA".\n\nOccasional problems with the interface. Sometimes I'll attack the wrong thing because it's tricky to line up the target, but not that often, frankly. Still could use a little work. Don't seem to have had a problem with the camera as other people do. But yeah, definitely a game I can recommend for people who don't mind an indie title.

No paint or modeling, but is that so bad? I am not an avid Warmachines player on the tabletop, but I might be after playing this game!\n\nPros\nGreat models and textures that give the game a Warmachines feel.\nThe campaign has difficulty. I am not just blowing through it.\nAI adjust well to your movments, Not always the same everytime.\nMassive potential for expansion more campaigns are allready in the works. All factions are supposed to have there own.\nA decent story in the first campaign.\nMissions vary from just kill everything.\nMultiplayer - Tabletop from home when you can't make it to your local shop.\n\nCons\nCamera is unpredictable during opponents movements and requires quiete a bit of adjustment on your turn.\nCamera obscured many times by talll buildings and trees.\nFPS issues randomly during play. Not always, but definitely noticable.\nUI maybe a bit too simple. (It works)\nCan be a long wait for multiplayer games\nAt the time of this writing leaderboard is not working.\nResource intensive\n\nOverall this is a great game and I definitely recommend it. Just wanted people to know some issues they might run into. I am sure patches are incoming and that multiplayer will grow as more people buy the game.

It's very much beta, hold off for the release version.\n\nThis is a review of the early access version, which is a beta. I will update it depending on my time played and upon release.\n\nNow then, the game:\nCurrently you have access to one single player mission and a limited multiplayer. Judging from that the game seems very promising, but still lacks a lot of polishing. The current interface is atrocious for example. Apart from that, we have a solid combat system, that's easy to understand. If you are familiar with the tabletop game that is, since there is as of yet no tutorial only a bunch of vids. But the tabletop rules seem to be translated faitfully into the game. Combos can be applied in the same way. Warjacks feel nice and stompy. Infantry give great utility.\n\nThe graphics are nice and very faithful to the originals. The sound effects are great and the animation looks nice, too.\n\nSo if you are a fan of Warmachine and don't mind paying for an early access, or just have to start playing right now, I recommend you get this game.\nIf you look for a tactical game, like steampunk and magitek and want to see the game grow, I recommend you get this game.\nIf you are looking for a fully fleshed out tactical game that will get you your money's worth immediately, I remmcomend you surf over to humbledbundle.com and pick up XCOM.

Furthermore the models once killed have been flying all over the place and clipping through the scenery which in truth is too busy and does not make it easy to understand the game. This game does have a few good points to it, the models are in truth very close to their resin and metal counterparts but in truth i'd take a functioning game over one that just about passes for aesthetically pleasing...

There are some problems tough, but most of them are currenty beeing adressed as i read some of the patch notes and the negative reviews. It is glitchy but most of those glitches can be circumvented by re-selectingthe unit or something as simple.\nMy only real problem is that the cinematic camera is really bad. Most of the times you cant see anything becaouse of some terrain blocking the view. Its nothing that major but it would be nice if they could fix that. There are some problems with the models transitioning from one animation to another but that is barely noticable.\nOverall i think they fixed most of the real problems (except the camera thing) that was mentionaed in the bad reviews, and they work constantly on upgrading, and fixing it.

As others have written, it is still pretty buggy and lacks a lot of polish.  Further, as of this writing, many many models from the tabletop have not yet been implemented in game.   The four base factions are represented with four warcasters each, as well as a small amount of Mercs.  There are plans for Retribution at some point in the future.  There are no Hordes armies, or plans to introduce them.\n\nThe good news is that the Dev team is responsive and chugging along at a pleasing rate.

I have just recently got into playing the table top game with a friend of mine and wanted to get this as a companion game to kind help learn some of the flow of the game.\n\nThe games can have some frustrating camera issues sometimes. It is not fixed to 90 degree rotations like in X-Com you can move the camera freely in all directions. This is really cool as you get a look at the battlefield at any point of view and can help get some killer screen shots.\n\nUnits really have some presence. When the jacks are walking about and attacking they really feel like they are giant metal constructs.\n\nGraphics are pretty good too, I run a GTX 770 4GB and I am pretty consistent in the 50-60 FPS on ultra settings (called awesome in the game)\n\nAlso note the variety of faction units is pretty small at this stage of the game. Devs say they are trying to get all the units from the tabletop into the game when it's all said and done.\n\nGame still has some work to be done but the developers seem like they are pretty hard at work with frequent updates and interaction with the forums.\n\nSome of the work that needs to be done that really catches your attention is the cut scenes in between missions are not really animated at all. Characters don't move no facial expressions or anything, just still screen shots with voice overs.

Eight hours is enough to do the tutorial, a couple of missions, and a couple of skirmishes. Initial impressions:\n\nPluses:\n-Great IP, faithfully rendered.\n-Simple, but deep\n-Excellent range of units already in-game\n-Graphics generally pretty good\n-Game never feels like it's 'cheating' as it does in games such as XCOM: Enemy Unknown, where you can miss a 100% shot\n\nMinuses:\n-Blurry graphics\n-Awful dialogue\n-Hard on GPU's\n-Terrible dialogue and voice acting\n-Camera panning is clunky\n-Dialogue and voice acting in single player campaign is utterly horrible and can't be skipped\n-No in-combat save system\n-Dialogue and voice acting are criminally bad, can't be skipped, and will make you want to kill yourself\n-Additional units as paid-for DLC (although I'd let that slide if they'd fix the voice acting and dialogue)\n-Doesn't look like you can cripple jacks by damaging components (ie a lucky shot blowing out a Jack cortex)\n-Lt. Allison Jakes is possible the most annoying character ever... and I've been annoyed by the annoying orange\n-Multiplayer/skirmish should have a range of points values, not everyone is looking for a 'big' game\n\nNeeds:\n-Map/module/scenario/campaign editor\n-Better scripting and voice acting\n-Camera movement refinement\n-Serious optimisation of graphics\n-Better tutorial, covering things like combined ranged attacks and unit facings\n-Better AI as opposed to simply 'more enemies'\n-Custom warcasters who gain skills as they level up would be a work of genius\n-Unit customisation/cosmetics (paint schemes, weapon shapes/sizes, slogans etc) even if pay2paint\n-Multi-multiplayer (3, 4, 5+ players at a time with a turn time limit)\n\nOverall, as a turn-based tactical (TBT) gamer, I'll give this game a 7/10, 8/10 if you're familiar with the IP and the tabletop version. It's a good game, it's just a little clunky. I have every confidence it'll get better.\n\nI'm looking forward to the next patch.","December 26, 2014","true","16.2"," 9 of 18 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","9","18","2","0"

I'm going to break it this time.\nIn theory this should have been a game I would have enjoyed but it's not. The makers may have had a great vision but were clearly way over their heads when it came to execution. Abysmal performance, The only game I have found with worse performance is "Legends Of Dawn" and that is saying something. Abysmal presentation. What passes for cut scenes is a joke. Holy cow even 'comic sans' would have been a better font choice. Abysmal UI and camera. If one or the other had been even acceptable it may have made the game somewhat playable. Patch after patch has come and gone and I've waited to see if the game would get sorted. It's mind blowing they would add DLC to game that's practically unplayable. Advice to devs; If you're going to persist with this game. Fix the performance by about 300%. I'm sure you crippled the camera to hide the fact the game frame rate will slide into single digits. If you actually have a graphic artist (which I doubt), fire them using kind words and hire a real one. Have a look a few tactical combat games and find a UI that works and copy that.\nAlternatively; Apologize to your buyers and shut the game down. I am not a bitter person, I am not going suffer after  losing my money on this game but an apology would be nice.\n\nUpdate: I've been rethinking this review as being overly hash. I get what the dev was trying to do and if it actually worked it would be pretty awesome. I like the idea of it being more a tabletop conversion than remixing the license into a game with it's own mechanics. I sincerely hope the dev can get the UI under control, improve the performance and AI because I would reverse my negative review in a heartbeat.","May 13, 2015","false","9.1"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

I also play the tabletop.\n\nWarmachine Tactics is yet another multiplayer-centric game that wants to charge you a box price and then additional expensive DLC bundles just for new multiplayer units. The problem with this is that their multiplayer mode isn't robust at all. It's like having a dedicated online FPS with only one match size (6v6, for example), one game mode (deathmatch), and a few maps.\n\nAn expensive box price or expensive multiplayer DLC bundles. Pick one. $15-20 for faction bundles is is silly on top of a $40 box price. I might as well purchase models for my actual Warmachine army instead.\n\nIt's important to note that if you have no previous experience with Warmachine, this game is not a very helpful place to start, as almost nothing is explained and what tooltips there are, are not useful. This is doubly true in multiplayer, where only previous Warmachine experience will make sense of the squad building menus.\n\nI really want to like this game, but they translated a lot of tabletop mechanics poorly, the controls are finnicky and punish people who don't play the tabletop, and the campaign is painful. Very little documentation in-game about what stats mean and what the various units are does not help this situation. It tries to be an 'almost Warmachine but not quite', and succeeds at being different. Different, however, is not better.\n\nThe graphics are really nice, the game just suffers from being very time-consuming in unnecessary ways. The primary draw of Warmahordes is objective-based gameplay, territory control, and good scaling of game mechanics from small skirmishes to large battles. There's only one mode (kill the enemy warcaster) in Tactics, one battle size (50 points), and only a few maps. Because all matches are 50 points, there's no such thing as a 'quick game'. All matches will typically take an hour or more to conclude, and that's a large problem for casual play.\n\nI wanted this game to be a gateway drug to Warmachine's tabletop, but only people who already enjoy the tabletop will be very interested in playing this, or paying for DLC expansions for their favorite factions. It lacks the strategic depth and breadth that makes the wargame so interesting, and that's a shame, because with more game modes, variable match sizes, and maps balanced for objective-based play, this game could be something great.\n\nInstead, they're developing expensive DLC faction add-ons for an anemic multiplayer experience that desperately needs more features, such as hotseat play. The ability to speed up or disable animations would also be nice, when you consider overall game length and how much of that is spent watching units take actions.","February 19, 2015","false","13.2"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

Normally, if I leave my warcaster standing around with nothing between him and the enemy warcaster, I've lost the game... but the AI isn't smart enough to go for an assassination, unfortunately.  That said, in multiplayer, the other players *are* smart enough (of course), and I think multiplayer is where the game really shines.\n\nThere have been a considerable number of patches to the game, and several partial factions added, plus several waves of additional units added.  It's going to take awhile for the game to catch up with the 10 years that Warmachine's been around in terms of variety of units, and they're likely going to need to add larger maps if they ever want to add colossals... but for a game that is trying to capture the spirit of a tabletop miniatures game on the PC platform, it does a good job.  Since I play it fairly regularly, it must be a pretty good game.","May 12, 2015","true","24.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","1"

I have to say first that i love warmachne the miniatures game and have been collecting and playing it for years. I also understand like all irl games made into video games that this was not going to be the same as the tabletop, however I did expect something close for non campaign modes. I was very dissapointed by privateer and all else involved here. the graphics are decentish and I enjoy seeing the models I've loved move with some with animation. Gameplay is were this game truly hurts me as a gamer and fan.\nthe gameplay is terrible right now. I would love to see something more of a guide or stat card set up for the game because while im playing i feel like any strategy matters little and im just clicking one guy to move then do whatever action it recommends. My W/L is 2/2 and hinestly I can't say really why i won or lost, it didnt really feel like a victory when i won and losses just felt bland i didnt feel like i had lost anything.\nI dont know how much money was invested into this game by privateer or the kickstarter, as a backer id give it more time before raising the refund army. yes this game was released way to early in development and should be called an alpha but if its really worked on i believe this game could be fixed.\nNOTE TO PRIVATEER!\nplease pull out from whitemoon and switch developers. please put more serious work into this game. i would love to see it succeed.","March 31, 2015","false","3.2"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

The UI is not optimized for high resolutions, the graphics are not optimized at all and are terrible at anything lower than high settings, cutscenes are simply character models standing there with a big box of subtitles at the bottom as there are no animations, the tutorial is rushed and not much is explained other than the bare basic stats which led to several incidences where units werent functioning as I wanted them to in certain instances because I did something wrong.\n\nThis is a simple case of developers were in the middle of making it and something happened whether it be running out of money or being pushed by the higherups to release a product and just pushing it to market with the foundation but nothing else in place.

So many people that are upset about the price.\n\nOK let me break it down for you.\n\nWhen a game that you are genuinely interested in is released at a standard price point, for example £30 both on the web or via steam, I don't see anyone whine or anything, if you want it you buy it, if you don't want it you don't buy it, simples.\n\nTake note of the above scenario, no whining, no complaining, no problems.\n\nBuuuuuuuuuuut.......on the other hand, the scenario below is quite different.\n\nWhen a game comes along that many people like the look of, they wanna play it, they are not sure if they would buy it in future or not, but regardless they still have some interest in it. Now in this case we have a game that is in late alpha/early beta stages of development, bugs, glitches and lack of content. During this period of time the game is open to those who wish to BUY INTO the beta testing phase for a higher fee which is matching that of the initial KS backers.\n\nOn top of this the deal is sweetened by the addition of extra content after the final release.\n\nNow it must be made clear that the second option/scenario is INTENDED for one of 2 possible groups of individuals:\n\n1) Die hard warmachine fans who simply cannot possibly stand the time of waiting and cost is no object to them in the face of not being able to play their treasured game franchise.\n\nor\n\n2) Those who do have some interest in the game, possibly not as much as a die hard fan, but nonetheless they are interested, however they have a very strong interest in shapeing the games continued development, learn more about the game, help find bugs and generally be part of the ongiong development process and are happy to pay the increased initial price of entry.\n\nNow when we look at those complaining about the price point of this game, they clearly are either trolls, or people who should be waiting for the game to be released at the standard £30 price point and at that point either choose to purchase or back out and play something else.\n\nHowever they are not.\n\nIt is clear to to us all then, that those who are whining (trolls/patient release purchasers) are simply making all of these whine posts because they are butthurt, they want the game NOW, but are not interested enough to pay the premium price, and hence they whine because they have to live with the fact they have to wait.\n\nWhat can we take away from all of this?\n\nWell apparently quite a few people have some growing up to do, simples.","July 12, 2014","true","0.6"," 20 of 40 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","20","40","0","3"

I'd try back in a few months maybe, or wait for a demo. The game itself might be fun save for the performance issues, UI, camera and controls. But truthfully even then it feels cumbersome and monotonous. Moving my soldiers felt like a chore - and I was happy in later rounds when a lot of them had died off.\n\nI think they tried a little too hard to stay a tabletop game, and the result is a game that plays 2-3x slower than it should.

Having been playing Warmachine for years, it looked like a good adapatation using the rich and detailed setting. As an advance graphically on previous games I've played, I did purchase some hardware upgrades, which had been overdue anyway.\n\nI'm afraid I did not back the kickstarter, as it really didn't look like I was needed. Nonetheless, I kept an eye on the development logs and awaited it coming into open beta. I purchased it when the price dropped from the deluxe £60 to the standard £20, as I really didn't need or want the extra shinies offered.\n\nWhat I got in beta was a game that was very much in beta. The multi-player game worked with a few bugs, but it did seem to roll along.  There was a certain scarcity of players, as several backers I'd talked to offline said they'd be waiting for it to be finished, while others were scared off by reviewers with higher standards than myself.\n\nI played the multiplayer games on and off for months, reporting the occasional bugs and making new friends. When the first (of four?) single-player campaigns came out I was pleased, although the decision to then declare the game released was a little surprising. There were still a few bugs, which cropped up as I played through the campaign. Given the lack of an in-level save function (and a new baby at home) my progress was slow, but I encountered 3 crash-causing bugs in 20 missions, the first two of which were down to performance issues on my PC, and the last was swiftly fixed by a patch. For a game still in development, I am happy with this ratio.\n\nAfter many hours of play, and reading the forums for this game, I think that White Moon Dreams has built this as a labour of love. It was a little premature onto beta, and again onto release, but it's now running smoothly, and WMD continue to work on it, add features, and interact with their players.\n\nIf you'd asked me when I puchased this game, I'd have said "wait a few months". A few months later, and I would reccomend this as an interesting and characterful game, with a lot of playability. For the standard price, I have already got my money's worth (in hours of entertainment) from this game and look forwards to the extra (and free) campaigns to come. The multiplayer side of things is also getting new content, bigger maps, etc, for those who focus on that.\n\nI look forwards to seeing where this game goes next!\n\n","December 19, 2014","true","83.3"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

I've been an intermediate players of warmachine, and really love the world/theme that the Iron Kingdoms titles have to offer. When the game came on sale, I decided to give it a try (despite the enless pages of negative reviews). I gave myself two days to try the game before writing the review. I really wanted to see how the game took me, and not just offer my initial feelings. So... the pros.\n\nPro's:\n-(Gameplay) The game is a great computer adaptation to the warmachine franchise. It gives you a real sense of strategy and tactical requirement to play.\n-(Gameplay) The units are very well modeled and armed after the tabletop. This allows a player who is familiar with the game world to get an immediate feel for how the units are supposed to play.\n-(Gameplay) Above all else, once you learn the UI, this game is FUN. That's right, FUN to play. This isn't a CoD style action game, but more a kin to UFO style combat. Your decisions and dice rolls will have immediate consequences in your battles.\n-(Campaign) The landscapes of the game are fantastic. It's crowded and but believably built.\n-(Campaign) The characters of the campaign are diverse, offering a variety of witty, funny, and serious moments to the game.\n-(Multiplayer) I really wish the game had co-op featuers. If not for the campaign, perhaps for larger multiplayer matches.\n-(Multiplayer) I played a single match between kador and cignar. The match was very pitched and until the end, we weren't sure who was going to win.  Ultimately, an assassination run by my charger clinched the victory (combined with a disruption pistol on my opponents dreadnaught).\n-(Multiplayer) The range of units and unit synergy are fantastic. And they keep releasing new units, which will further change the dynamics of the matches. From disruption bolts, head-butts, and stunning lightning bolts, there's seemingly dozens of combinations to change a dire situation into a chance!\n\nCons-\nO.K... There are a lot of cons. As I'm sure you've all read. But the one things that I'd like to point out. These Cons can be FIXED. This game feels EARLY, like a beta. Hopefully, the developers will continue to smooth out the engine.\n\n-(Gameplay) I really wish that you could CHOOSE the upgrades your units/warcasters get at the end of the mission. It would be a nice way of customizing the hero to your own preferences.\n-(Camera) The camera is terrible. You frequently find yourself needing to change your angle and rotation to get a good view of whats going on. Sometimes, things are going on that are obscured by terrain when your opponent is moving. I found the arrow keys better for moving around the battlefield than the mouse commands\n--Objects(Like buildings) can get in the way of your issueing move orders, even if you do not SEE a structure in your way. It's due to poor clipping during object creation. Measure twice, move once. You may need to change your angle before continueing your move.\n--WHY does the camera rotate around beneath your god-view feet, and not rotate around where your focused? Developers, please fix this...\n-(UI) The UI is also... horrible. It's takes a while to get used to, and offers little to no explaination as to why things can't happen.\n--There is no seamless change from your turns movement to out of turn movement (energize or quick work).\n--There is no explaination to which unit you are currently "stuck" on (untill you've ended ALL it's phases/turns). There may be a slight hue to the circle below it, but that's not much to go on.\n--The UI takes up too much of the game screen. It may have pertinent information (it usually does), but it also impedes the atmosphere of the game.\n-(Grapics) I realize you saved a ton of money by using still art for the cut-scenes... but really... you think it would kill you to have moving mouths and a believable conversation going on?\n-(BUGS) The game is very buggy...\n--Units sometimes graphically face the wrong way.\n--The game will crash if you complete conversations or objectives in the wrong order (In your very first mission, I crashed my game when I ran to activate Bandit with my warcaster earlier than the game wanted me to (Since I know in game that warcasters can activate jacks). I bypassed the first conversation (about being attacked) by fleeing straight to bandit (where is bandit conversation) and when the first conversation finally happenned, it crashed the game. So please, treat this game like a story, and follow the flow of the game.\n\nConclusion: I'm recommending this game. It's a diamond in the rough. Some very... rough... rough. The problems that exist in the game are superficial and can easily be learned and avoided. The core mechanics of the game are still very fun, and if you're into this style of tabletop emulation, I highly suggest trying it. It's all the better with friends. And please, wait a day or two before writing a review out of anxiety. The UI isn't impossible, it's just not intuitive.","January 22, 2015","true","30.9"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","1"

I did not jump on the bandwagon during the early release because the price tag seemed a bit high for me when those early reviews weren't very favorable. Same story when the game was released.\n\nFinally tried out the free demo. I'm very sad to confirm that everything people have said is true. The game isn't unfun - it's just an unpolished mess that wouldn't be considered finished by most standards. Lack of animated dialogue is a glaring example. Not a deal-breaker, but how can Whitemoon really expect us to pay full price for a game where so many obvious corners have been cut?\n\nAt half the price, I'd still be very hesitant to buy in because you're only getting a core list of units. We're expected to pay an addition $2-$3 per extra unit type that we want to add? Nice try - give us an entire expansion worth of units for $10, work on the animation issues, and then I might consider purchasing the game... if I can get a good sale price.","April 26, 2015","false","2.1"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Which is odd because the game runs perfectly fine else. The motion blur is sickening, but can be disabled.\nThe camera is a absolute mess, on 50% of the actions it clips through walls or buildings, and it randomly jumps between your previous location and the current action of your enemy. Instead the camera should stay on the enemy, if its the enemies turn.\nHotkeys for ability seleciton and general UI seem unfinished. As an example: sometimes you can boost the attack (aka chance to hit) or the power (dmg) of a selected skill, sometimes boosting attack does both, but the UI shows a total useless "power" button too, instead of having a third kind of button "attack + power".\nUnit selection progress is a mess, and the game doenst communicate basic rulesets to you, for example choosing combined range attacks on normal soldiers will only allow you to move and attack with normal soldiers, until the attack is finally executed. Another example would be out of turn actions. In general you are never sure in which "phase" of a turn you are in, or which units actually still have moves/actions left to perform, and why.\nAnother problem, in direct comparision to XCOM:EW, you cant move units while others are still in their movement, even worse, the game forces you to watch a action cam of every unimportant action you take with any unit (third person camera follows basic foot soldier on a simple move command). A game like this should only highlight important actions or at least give you a option for it in the menu, thats pretty much standard. Instead it unnecessarily makes the game slow, and you are often just waiting for your own units to peform ,rather then thinking about what to do.\n\nIts a shame that there is so much negative to say about the game as the basic idea is actually pretty good. You can only use your mechs when your hero is in range of them, making it vital where you position your character. Normal food soldiers are uterly useless if not used in the correct way. Further you have to think ahead and decide if you want to do more with your hero or your mechs, as you have to divide focus points between all of them at the beginning of your turn, which are a vital resource for power attacks, spells and boosting chance or damage of your attacks for either of the units.\n\nSo my final verdict of the game is the following, it has a really good base concept under the hood, but the lackluster UI, the very limited camera, and the forced action cam, as well as unclear mechanics make it to much of a hassle. The game simply feels unpolished and unloved on everything it does.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mothmanprophet/recommended/253510/","mothmanprophet","Mothman Prophet","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mothmanprophet/","171 products in account","Warmachine Tactics is a thrown together mess. If you plan to buy it, wait for it to be on sale. The campaign is hardly worth the effort as it is broken rather than genuinely difficult. The skirmish matches are OK, but the enemy AI leaves much to be desired. Think of this game as a multiplayer only rather than any kind of fulfilling single-player experience.\n\nSTORY:\nThe campaign is arduous and the difficulty mainly comes from the game being broken rather than genuinely hard. The campaign flip flops on which characters are critical to your success and nothing is more frustrating than seeing "Keep Jakes, Sarge, Rourke, and your Warjacks alive." However, several missions throughout the game only have "Keep Jakes alive." as your main objective. It gets incredibly frustrating when you have taken the enemy units apart and their one remaining unit runs past all our others to critically strike one your five or more essential characters, causing you to instantly lose the game after you may have put an hour or more into it. Though the campaign claims to sport an "extensive, story-driven experience"; I felt that it was sloppy and the story is one-dimensional and dull. Your character, Lt. Allison Jakes, proves her worth as she makes the worst tactical decisions possible and costs countless lives of her loyal men as they die for her petty revenge quest and foolish mistakes. Multiple times in the story, she defeats an enemy warcaster who then begs for their life causing her to stay her hand, only so that they can attack her while her men stand idly by. So many of the "story moments" in the game involve Lt. Jakes forcing her men to charge into completely avoidable conflicts causing them to die in droves as she celebrates her tactical genius. I hated Jakes by end of the campaign. But worry not all you fanboys, all of the other characters will constantly yammer on and on about how amazing and brilliant she is.\n\nPRESENTATION:\nThe game has nice animations and I really enjoyed the look of each unit. However, glitches abound and many times the enemy characters can run straight through walls to attack you when you thought you were safe. During the enemy turn, the camera bugs out like mad, crudely snapping back to an overhead view of your troops before being wrestled away from you to watch an enemy character stroll towards you and snapping back into overhead again. The process can be nauseating and since you will usually be hilariously outnumbered (in the campaign), prepare to watch the sickening camera jolts for a good 3-5 minutes each enemy turn.\n\nAll who have played Warmachine know the importance of unit facing. If you haven't, then basically you get a higher chance of damage by hitting units in the back; also, you need to actually be facing a unit in order to attack it. Warmachine Tactics seems to think that it knows where your units should be facing better than you do; often crudely spinning your units to face a random direction after a completed movement. This forces you to micro-manage your units' facing after every single move.\n\nSometimes the textures and colors of the terrain completely blot out your unit movement graphics (the little colored halo on the ground that indicates where you want them to move to). This makes viewing countdown timers, movement grids, facing arrows, and many other essential graphical cues, nearly impossible in some levels.\n\nThe game also feels the need to prevent you from pausing it, ever. You can bring up a pause menu, but the game continues to run in the background. This can be very annoying even though with a turn-based game you don't need to worry about being attacked during your turn.\n\nSUMMARY:\nThere is a lot more I could say about this game, but in the interest of brevity I will hold off for now. Just know that for $39.99, you will be getting little better than a late Alpha or early Beta stage game that is riddled with issues. Yes, the units look pretty and there are plenty of different units to choose from (go Stormblades). Unfortunately, this game shames its table-top counterpart by being sloppy and bug infested. I do enjoy playing the Skirmishes and the multiplayer is not bad. If you really love Warmachine, pick this up, but only when it's on sale.","February 1, 2015","false","36.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

This plays far more like a reasonably far along early access game than anything.  Graphical and sound glitches are everywhere.  Campaign cutscenes are just character models standing *completely* still while the camera pans.  The HUD is atrocious, with no clear way of cycling through troops or immediately telling which troops are still active.  The screen is constantly marked with the version number and framerate, insisting that this isn't even a 1.0 release.  The list continues.\n\nIf this game was in early access, I would quickly overlook these problems.  After all, the core game is here and it is pretty solid.  But to call this a finished product is ludicrous.  It's too bad, too.

I especially enjoy the ability to combine volleys of ranged attacks, as well as the dynamic of focus allocation.  The units are sufficiently diverse, and it seems to have all of the elements needed to be great.\n\nTHE BAD: The view/interface is terrible.  An ability to see the battlefield is CRUCIAL for this sort of game, but the zoom feature doesn't allow you to zoom out to a level that would be strategically useful.  You're stuck in tunnel vision.  It sounds like a small thing, I know, but it's integral to gameplay.  It'd be like if an otherwise brilliant shooter only allowed you to play in the third person.

I still recommend it for the multiplayer, but I believe that is only one part of the game. The single player campaign is terrible. There isn't a difficult level option, and no option to save/load. The AI is stupid. And I have serious doubts if the percentage values of the attacks is correct. Every mission is the same thing, stupid and unclear objectives and waves of enemies. You are in a perpetual disadvantage in comparison with the machine. I'm mean, the disadvantage is unfair, is not like Xcom where the enemies begin with the better position and know the terrain, but you gain better equipment and the soldiers really develop. No, not in warmachine. Here your unities doesn't, your caster improve from the weak warcaster to the regular warcaster. Different of the Xcom, when the enemy have a fixed number of unities, here the machine just doesn't. In certain missions the number of enemies is infinite. The last mission you take damage for the enemies and from some evil machine, and not a low damage. No, is more than 50% of health of your unity! Thats stupid, thats unfair. That's atari level of design!  Even the last  mission of Warcraft 3 and Frozen Throne is not that level of difficulty. Seriously, after xcom that game is a shame!\nSo, there are better games of turn level strategy in steam. Don't buy this game only because the graphics look cool. They are, but the gameplay, eve in the multiplayer, still broken. All the attacks and magic look the same, doesn't matter if it is an electrical attack, or fire attack or ice attack or a shot or a explosion.\nSee, I really like Iron Kingdoms, a have minis, books and all, but that game just doesn't do justice to the scenario.","March 20, 2015","false","107.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Warmachine Tactics is essentiantially the Tabletop game put into a videogame. I bought this game because I used to be a Warhammer tabletop player and was looking to get into tabletop games again, I heard about Warmachine and Privateer Press. What this game does is essentially introduce you to the world of Warmachine and the playable races. This is absolutey fantastic! Rather than go out and spend hundreds of dollars on models and books and hours of painting models as a new player only to learn that you didnt like the faction you picked this game is a great introductory into the rules, spells, abilities and over all combat doctrine of each race.\n\nI see complaints about UI and all sorts of bugs, I got this game, created a unit list, and started playing quickmatch and figured it out in about 5 minutes.  The game is lacking in unit rosters but has enough variability for each race that you can build your battlegroup any way you want to play. It isnt the most emmersive or the most well-toned game but for a digital tabletop this game is fantastic considering it isnt a AAA title.\n\nI reccomend this game to anyone interested in either the tabletop or just want to play around with a Stratego on Steroids.

It captures most of the elements of the tabletop while still having its own unique feel. The amount of warrior health and lack of warjack systems is weird at first but you get used to it. Warriors have a nice dynamic of having useful buff/debuffs while still being fairly weak.\n\nThe beta is fairly rough, but it is coming along nicely from what i've seen. I've seen a number of community suggestions be implemented, which has improved a lot of the gameplay.\n\nThe price is high but that is out of fidelity to the kickstarters. It is also an obligated purchase of the deluxe edition which comes with the mercenary faction and Apotheosis casters and jacks. The base game with full campaign and all four full factions will likely be much cheaper.

RAAAAARGH' and I can understand why, they got it on early access and forgot the fact that its not finished and its a work in progress..\n\nThere's also a number of people out there that, like me, play the miniatures game.. and they don't like it because its not the computer form of the miniature game.\n\nAnd there are probably the small minority of people that got it later, dont play the miniature game, but dont like something about the way it works or something..\n\nNow while all these points are totally understandable, and in some cases, correct..\n\nI like it.\n\nI kept in mind its not the finished, polished end product.. that its not a direct pc copy of the miniature game and that there had to be limits to what it could do. because well.. lets face it the miniature game has an infinite number of possibilities in how its played..\n\nThe campaign is pretty cool.. I'm not a Cygnar player, I dont know loads about them.. but I'm enjoying it. It's a little clunky at times.. there are levels in white snow where your direction and movement markers are in white.. so its kinda guess the movement.. but largely the game is fun and its well thought out.. I had a go with Cryx on skirmish mode the other day and that was pretty cool too.. I'm looking forward to my first multiplayer game soon.\n\nI would recommend this game to any one that wants a turn based steam punk ish strategy game and is happy to know that its not 100% perfect, but its close enough that it'll keep you entertained for some time..

From a strategy game perspective the controls are horrid in every respect(camera, unit control, etc), fps rarely goes above 40 even on the lowest setting, randomly chugs when the computer does anything, and the story mode has no real hub or mission select that I can tell, it just starts and goes from one mission to the next with no down time.  As for its relation to the tabletop, it's complete crap.   They had an entire game system laid out for them, quite literally all they had to do was make a dice rolling program and movement controls, but no they decided to go from scratch and just borrow the name of stats rather than using the tried and balance numbers given by the game.  "Units" are broken into solos that take far too much to kill and do far too much damage to a 'jack to be reasonable(the point of casters is to feel like a badass who controls mechs that can stomp people to dust, but apparently these are just paper mache replicas of those mechs).\n\nOther little things that annoy me are the volume levels in the game(I had to turn the music down to 2 just to hear any people over it) and the lazyness in the 'cutscenes', they didn't even animate any of them, they didn't animate the mouths moving or even just a simple walk animation.  The quality of the game compared to how much money they got from the kickstarter for it is just appalling.  I would advise any sane person to stay away from this and just get vassal if you wanted to play warmachine online or Xcom if you need that strategy fix.","December 19, 2014","false","10.2"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","5","12","0","0"

Sadly, the only thing that really makes it worth playing is the single player storyline, which is decent, and the atmosphere. The game mechanics have been redone to the point where it's a completely different game system - so different that my interest in the multiplayer is quickly dying. It's not a game for WM/H gamers, it's a generic computer game based on Privateer Press IP, and it's not a very good one.\n\nFor people who aren't into the tabletop game, there is little point in buying this. I enjoy it mostly because of my love for the setting, I doubt I'd have played more than a few missions otherwise. The camera is annoying and takes a lot of work, the interface is clunky and inelegant, the game is riddled with bugs (including crash-bugs and bugs that allow both the player and the computer to do things like walking through walls), there are still minor problems that should have been gone long before launch (like the colour of various important lines and markers being too light to see on snow, or disappearing under landscape features), the default settings for sound and graphics are way off (I had to reduce the music volume to 2/10 to hear voices), you can't skip cut-scenes (adding to the irritation when you have to restart a mission - there is no option for saving during missions)... the list goes on forever.\n\nIn short, this game had a lot of potential, but it is so far away from being what it could that no amount of patching can fix it. I regret buying it at full price, and would caution others against doing the same.","November 27, 2014","false","39.4"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","5","12","0","0"

I really enjoyed the first dawn of war game and the second was... Fine i guess, but I had really gotten into the Iron Kingdoms, so this was it, my chance to play some Warmachine. The first issue arose immediately, the price, a kickstarter game should not be so ridiculously expensive, but that was OK, I'd just wait for a steam sale like I usually do and play some of the demo while I waited. The second issue peaked it's ugly head above water while playing the demo, the gameplay was an entire city constructed primarily of klunk and the unit selection was puny, but it was only a free demo so I just (incorrectly) assumed that there was a veritable cornucopia of content just behind the locked door, what a fool I was. Even with access to the full game the unit selection was pitiful and the klunk city limits stretched into the horizon, but maybe patches will fix it, thought I, which is where the third issue burst forth from the ground like some horrible cyclopean beast, the same beast which has strangled so many potentially great titles in their cribs, I speak of course of DLC. As other reviewers have no doubt mentioned the DLC is overpriced, even with the newly announced "price cut" each clocks in at $10 and while this may not be as egregious for the Mercs or Retribution bundles (it still is) the Warcaster and Jack bundles are simply ludicrous, 4 units for $10? I would rather not sell my home, but thank you for the kind offer.\n\nSo the question still remains, is it good? Is it worth my hard earned dollars/pounds/euro/whatever? The answer, in my opinion is an emphatic but remorseful no. If this game wants to be anything other than a floundering, half funtional cash grab it needs a lot of work, the klunkiness needs to be reduced considerably, the factions need to be expanded and the DLC needs to be added as regular content available upon purchase and expanded as well. If they do enact these changes I truely believe we will have a game which both promotes its source material and allows enthusiasts without an outlet (such as myself) to experiance the world of the Iron Kingdoms. Until then keep an eye on the reviews, you never know, the creators may decide that they don't need to bleed their creation for every cent and give us the game we crave and deserve.","April 7","false","10.4"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","2","6","0","0"

The real reason I cannot recommend this game is the AI.  It is absolutely atrocious in the skirmish mode, and pretty weak in the campaign.  It is a waste of time to play against the computer in skirmish mode as it constantly makes ridiculous moves that make the game a pushover.\n\nThose of you who have played tabletop will understand what I mean with a simple example: in a recent skirmish game, the computer ran Severius (a squishy backline caster) up to be adjacent with my warcaster, who happened to be the Butcher (actually Butcher3 from the minis game minus his argii/arguses).  Didn't attack or anything else.  Just ran him up base-to-base with what may be the deadliest warcaster in the game.  Another example (and even those who haven't played tabletop will understand this): Cygnar Gunmages.  They have the word "GUN" in the name of the unit.  So what do they seem to do most of the time in the game?  Charge into melee.\n\nI've played to mission four or five in the campaign and maybe it shines there, but I doubt it.  I also have my doubts about DLC.  It didn't affect my recommendation, but I feel like this game is very expandable.

A solid indie game with a lot of heart - and some awkward choices. The UI looks like it was done by the coders who have become so use to its appearance that they have just accepted it. Which is a shame because it is the game’s biggest flaw. However, once you accept it yourself the game is just what I hoped it would be.\n\nThe game creates an excellent representation of playing a table top game (TTG). I myself was not a Warmachines veteran, but I have played other TTGs. So not being able to judge the mechanics – only the experience it is very successful. Part of how this is done comes from the lack of mechanization a significant amount of what you do is left completely up to you. So if you move a character and he is facing the wrong way and you forget to adjust his direction (there is a button for this) that’s too bad. A HUD will not prompt you or attempt to fix it automatically. Do you see what I mean just like a TTG. This sort of infraction during a traditional game happens and can be exploited.\n\nI found the best way to understand the strengths of the various factions was to use the skirmish mode. This is the heart and soul of Warmachines: Tactics after you finish the campaign and is the only repayable portion of the game. There is no option the replay the campaign under a different faction, or other campaigns for other factions. Oh well, I’m sure the developer will offer them as DLC (which is no worse than buying campaigns of physical models) but for some reason the fan boys are crying over this idea. Whatever. I like that they are offering more models, more environments etc. It means they are still involved and looking to grow the idea.

Played the single player tutorial mission, and 3 multiplayer matches. I lost the first 2 and won the 3rd. Each battle was exciting, involved and at times very intense. The last battle, in which I was The Protectorate of Menoth and my opponent was Khador, was really a lot of fun. It took a long time to resolve, as both of us were playing smart. Victory tasted sweeter for being hard fought and hard won. When you start to understand the synergies of your units the gameplay feels very satisfying; you feel like you have to earn victory against a competent opponent. It is also easy to see that there is plenty of depth to be had here, once you start to absorb the subtlties.\n\nThere were a few minor issues, but nothing game-breaking and no crashes or disconnects.

Graphics are OK. However I don't reccomend this game at early access. There is extremely limited functionality at this stage, it's hard to even call it a beta. The gameplay is clunky, Even for a turn based game. It is difficult to figure out when you can and can't fire for example. Also there is virtually no-one who is playing multiplayer which means all you get is 1 small level.\nHopefully the full version makes up for this and people get onboard for multiplayer. If the gameplay is tweaked a little, you can play the campaign and you get to select your own units the full version could be worth buying when it becomes available.

That being said, I suspect that the Steam price of $65 is highly inflated and not at all worth the price of admission from what I have experienced so far. Assuming that everything is released, even with improvements, there will invariably be comparisons made between this game and other strategy games: Starcraft II being the most likely. If I were to compare Warmachine Tactics to Starcraft II at the price point at time of release, Starcraft II wins.\n\nThe performance of this game on my PC is fairly poor. While my PC is not a high end gaming machine, it beats the low end minimum specs while failing shy of the recommended specs. I have to play at the lowest resolution (1280x720) and low graphic settings to get 18 FPS. Compared to other strategy games, where I can get 30+ FPS, I'm a little troubled. Starcraft is real-time; Warmachine is turn-based. My performance is currently halved and that's at minimum quality. The UI is cluttered, though that isn't aided by playing at the lowest resolution the game allows. Which begs the question: how can an older RTS like Starcraft II perform so much better than a modern turn-based game? Were new DX features implemented because it was new and shiny?\n\nAll in all, as a (disappointed) backer, I get the game for $20.  Had I waited for release, I would pass on this title at full price, even when completed, because there are games out there with a lower cost of entry. There are _free_ games out there that perform better than the currently available game.\n\n"That’s what we want you to experience in WARMACHINE: Tactics, the turn-based tactics game that, with your help, will bring the award-winning WARMACHINE miniatures game from the tabletop to your desktop PC or Mac." With all due respect, it does not: http://steamcommunity.com//sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=275624464 - Imagine my surprise when a warrior model had hit points and didn't die when shot...

The camera is so bad and frustrating that it has caused me to rage quit the game several times. I can only take so much of the stupid camera clipping into terain/walls/etc. Also, whoever did the programming for movement indicators on tiles really messed up with how they show up in snow. In the 4th mission (escape from the train) I cannot even see the movement markers against the snow terrain because the colors are so oversaturated.\n\nAlso, unit movement is really a pain to manage, and I am constantly making unintential moves.\n\nFor whatever reason, the game also seems to redraw the scene everytime it moves across the map to show different sections. This results in huge fps drops and freezes every time a new unit moves. Major pain to watch. I have very good system specs, so I know it is not the issue, looks like just bad coding. Honestly have no idea why they decided to make this thing in Unreal...if it was simpler it would probably be a lot more playable.\n\nCutscenes so far are all still images and not animated...feels very cheap and unfinished.\n\nCompared to other tactics type games, this one is pretty bad and definitely feels like it was done by amateurs, especially when compared to games like xcom.

Take note though, if you are into fast paced action this game will not be for you.\n\nWarmachine: Tactics a a very accurate PC conversion of the tabletop wargame Warmachine. If you know and love the tabletop game, you'll love the PC version as well. Any tabletop wargamer will instanly feel at home though. The game takes place on a fairly small map where you depploy, move and fight with your Warcaster (general), Warjacks (mechs) and Infantry.  The game feels well balanced at the moment.\n\nThe single player campaign is reasonably fun but more importantly sets you up well for the multiplayer part of the game. That is where the true heart is for Warmachine, facing other players. That's also the only real downside. Since the game is turn-based you are dependant on how fast, or slow, your opponent plays. Be prepared to stare at your screen for minutes while your opponent does nothing.\n\nOn the positive side though, Warmachine is an enjoyable game. Terrain and use of skills is critical an conveys the feel of a true tabletop game. The game looks nice and runs quite well. The UI isn't very pretty but does an adequate job considering the fairly large amount of options each skill and sub-skill has. It prevents the need for cumbersome menus. It also feels pretty inituitive to me.\n\nAll in all you cannot get closer to tabletop gaming than this. The game isn't for everyone but if you enjoy this sort of thing you can't go wrong with Warmachine.","January 6, 2015","true","6.4"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

And that's not the worst part.\nThe UI IS THE MOST AWFUL THING I EVER SAW. The game designer is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and they have no art direction for the 2d part of the whole game. Every thing not in the game scene is ♥♥♥♥ing ridicolous and horrible. You can't play this game. Camera controls are freaking awful and you will misclick every time. And this game is so stupid that you will lose a mission one hour long cause you clicked to move a unit but you couldn't see where you clicked cause the ♥♥♥♥ing interface is UNDER the snow textures and suddenly you clicked on a wall where there was the ui visible but you cant click there so the unit go the other direction, dies and you lose the stupid mission. is so unplayable it's a ♥♥♥♥ing alpha and they sell it for 25 bucks are you insane?\n\nShort version: Gameplay is good but you can't play the game so don't spend your money cause whitemoon are a bunch of noobs at their first game.\n\nHopefully they will read my comment, be shamed of themselves and spend some money to buy some good art direction and some SERIOUS technical director to deliver a decent product.

I already play Warmachine, so I was excited to be able to play an electronic version of it, so I have options when I can't play with others. But sadly, I can't recommend this right now. On the Mac version, the framerate is so low, even with lowest graphical settings, and lowest resolution, that it is unplayable. 15 fps, not even consistently is pretty bad. It freezes often, especially if you rotate the view and it clips into a terrain wall. I'm frequently waiting for it to return control to me. This is especially frustrating when it tends to lag and skip graphically, and you find the view takes off out of your control, and then your stuck waiting for it to catch up. The developer has admitted that they have not optimised as well for the Mac, and this is pretty apparent. I have a high end machine, with 20Gb of RAM in it, and have no problems running other games full screen, with all the bells and whistles turned on. I'm hugely disappointed. I just hope they will be able to fix this, hopefully not too far in the future. Don't worry about adding more features, get the basics right first please!

As it stands would like it to show a list of players waiting on game instead of having to find a host in multiplayer. Follows the rules for the most part to the miniatures game and thanks to it learned some rules real life players have been nerfing. The Focus allocation at the beginning of each turn is better now also than it was before as well just wish it had a chat window but personally could make games take longer.\n\nLong story short as stands limited but updated regularly. High priced to match Beta level backers of the Kickstarter but at least Early Access buyers can get 20 units free. Some graphics are buggy but I've seen worse in betas and some rules nitpickings but that's betas. As it stands content and can't wait for the actual release.\n\nIt's not on here to give them more money only but if you want beta access with some freebies then by all means otherwise they announced a base game will release at launch so no need to worry too much now. With being backed on Kickstarter and a parent miniatures company of over ten years will be glad to see it finished in a month.","July 15, 2014","true","29.3"," 13 of 30 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","13","30","0","0"

A complete departure from the Tabletop game, which wouldn't have been awful it had been done well. Turns are slow, very slow, it's not unlikely to be waiting 15 minutes for an opponent to take their turn. The 5 star stat ranking system is an awful idea, it makes no sense and gives no real indication of the ability of a unit. Basic units, Winterguard, etc, have up to 12 hit boxes which serves only to slow the game to a crawl. Two Jacks are manditory in every army. There's a cap of 16 models per army.

The game is still in beta and is looking to be released in a month's time.\n\nMy gaming rig has a Intel i7 3770 @ 3.4Ghz, 16GB DDR3 1333MHz Kingston Value RAM, Gigabyte GTX660Ti 2GB, runs off a 1TB HDD 7200RPM. (I am getting a EVGA GTX780 very shortly so I'll edit for the difference in frames per second.)\n\nPricing: I'm not a Kickstarter Backer. When Warmachine Tactics was released on Steam for Early Access, I brought it immediately, didn't really care about the price. I had read what the game currently has for content. For a Digital Deluxe Edition, £49.99 is a decent price point for what players will be eventually getting when it's fully complete. I've paid more for other games but they were complete games, all content was there except for the future DLC with Season Passes. I didn't do any tutorials or play the Multiplayer yet, I wanted to see what the game could potential offer.\n\nGame Performance: Moving onto the actual game itself, I pumped the settings up to max as high as they could go and played the Single-player scenario. The game was soild, running around 25-40fps @ 1920x1080 @60Hz, this is still beta and is subject to change until the release date for further optimization as well as future improvements. It played very nicely, no crashes or errors while playing the scenario. A bug with the units running through market food stands at the beginning of the level but that can be sorted out.\n\nVisuals: The game looks very nicely crafted, the game models are very accurate to their original tabletop models and can individually pick out what warcaster or unit is. The map for the single-player scenario is beautifully created and solid representation of the Warmachine world, with the weathering effects are good so far, something you'd expect for the winter feel.\n\nInterface: The UI is decent but large on a 1920x1080 though boarders and such aren't polished so they don't fit the role. I hope they are refined later on.\n\nSounds: As you'd expect, the sound effects for melee and range thus far a good. Background music is fitting.\n\nDisclaminer. Just a reminder I've only played the Single Player scenario, that's all.\n\nSo the important question, is Warmachine Tactics worth it. Personal opinion, with the price now at £37.97 (£49.99 previous price) with the current content and now with an update (have yet to play), it feels a little more worth it but I'd rather wait till all the content for the Digital Deluxe there. So I'll say I do recommend the game but with a 'Buyer Beware' caution solely on the content to price ratio.\n\n---- ---- ----\n\nSide Note:\nAfter tweeting and posting a message on Facebook. I really would like to know why the price changed since I did buy it for £49.99 from the developers and those who brought it for the higher price. Is there a possible chance of getting the difference refunded to the Steam Wallet?","July 15, 2014","true","0.7"," 13 of 31 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","13","31","0","0"

While the game has bugs (this is beta after all) WhiteMoon Dream has always been very transparent about what is going on with the game.  Player issues are addressed, bugs are taken care of, and input is welcomed.  The game looks great and even with the current issue of low frames, its not choppy enough to be a deal breaker.  AI for the missions seem a little to hard scripted (very limited awareness) but we have only been give access to one mission and its the second mission of the campaign and I feel they are going easy on us.  The heart of this game is around the Multi-player mode.  Playing against real players with a diverse set of units and skills lends itself to making each MP game unique.  Replay will be very high even before all the DLC comes out in the months to years following(for those don't know the TT Warmachine has MANY MANY times the units currently planed for release).\n\nA review for the game would not be complete without a comment or two about the current price of the game.  At $65 many people complain that its too much.  WMD has addressed its reasoning for the price and will not be changing it till after the game it out of Early Access.  The only important question left then about the price is this, is there VALUE of the game.  The short answer is Yes! How do i justify it beyond my above comments? Three little words..."Collectors Edition Release".  Many of us, myself included, have and do pay far more then $65 to pre-order collectors editions that don't have half the DLC that is being offered here.  Stop trying to look at this as a pay to play Beta and start looking at it like a Collectors Edition that happens to offer Beta access.  So if you are not a Collectors Edition buy just kick back and wait till normal release or a steam sale in any case it will be money well spent.","July 10, 2014","true","83.2"," 32 of 71 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","32","71","0","3"

If you don't want to pay that much, wait for the full release, and don't get the mercs or Apotheosis units.\n\nAll that being said, the game does show a lot of promise in it's current stage.

It plays like most turn based, grid based strategy games. You have zones representing your move distance and your ranged attack distance. Attacks have a percentage chance to hit. Your "warcasters" have an interesting mechanic, where they have a limited number of action points per turn, that they can choose to spend on extra attacks or attack boosts for themselves, or give to their golem-like "warjack", which is big and powerful, but has to stay near them.\n\nHowever, you probably won't care enough to learn more about the game than this. If they didn't claim otherwise, you'd think this was an early access title. I have never seen a worse camera in a game; half the time you won't be able to see your own units. The action camera will switch back and forth between normal view and zoomed in view every time an ally moves or attacks, which results in it flickering back and forth multiple times for every single unit. Everything looks like a blurry, pixellated mess. Attack ranges are unclear from the interface, and unless I am missing something, there's no way to undo a move after realizing you've moved out of attack range.\n\nNot worth your money unless they release some pretty major patches in the future.","November 28, 2014","false","0.8"," 1 of 7 people (14%) found this review helpful","14","1","7","0","0"

As for the game it's buggy, has performance issues, and is simply not finished. Moving your avatar or the camera can be more of a challenge than the enemies you face. This game is not worth $40, I was hoping for something like a fire emblem or fanal fantasy tactics, but this game in its current state comes no where close. In my opinion one flaw I do not like is Pre rendered level ups, I haven't got to far into the game, but it seems only your main avatar will level up one stat at the end of each level, i think the stat that levels up has all ready been chosen, there is no exp in this game as far as I can tell. The game does do some things really well, use strategy to move your characters into places to trigger more powerful combo attacks to defeat powerful ememies in one turn. Until they patch this game more it is not worth $40, and selling it for $40 is the main reason I'm giving it a negative review.","November 24, 2014","false","1.3"," 5 of 16 people (31%) found this review helpful","31","5","16","0","0"

So here is what gets me.  The negative reviews are on a game that is in developement.  If you would have read all the info you would probalby understand this.  How can paying $65 now be a bad deal?  Once the game is released in full I will be getting a lot of cool stuff to play with that others will have to pay for, get the good deal now or wait till later and don't get the cool stuff.  I say get a job and you will realize that this is not that bad of a price point, especiallyl if you play the tabletop game, I never hear anyone complaining about the price of models, how many hundreds of dollars have you spent playing the tabletop game.  Let me get to my point.  Enjoy the early access for what it is, give input that can help in developement of the final product and stop complaining and just wait for the full release completed game. rant over!\n\nThe review above was from last year when the game came out.  Then I have been waiting patiently and more patienlty and now finally the graphics on the Mac are fixed but it is still slow and buggy and it loses mouse control, freezes up and then I have to force quit.  So at this point I am giving up and will check back in 3 or 4 months.  frustrating.  maybe I will buy a PC an see if it works so I can justify giving it a thumbs up.  I wouldn't say its a complete failure but definitely not what I expected, maybe the tech company got in over their head on what they could deliver.

This game has gone from completely unplayable to freakin' fantastic in the space of a couple of patches.  They fixed the clunky controls and now it's nice and smooth to play.  Highly recommended for fans of tabletop games!\n\nHaven't seen the cutscenes yet, but if they remain unchanged, I'd still give this a 4/5, I can work with crummy cutscenes if the game itself is awesome.  Looking forward to playing this with some friends online!\n\nOriginal (now outdated review)\nI want to be able to recommend this game, I really do.  In some ways, I really feel like it does capture the tabletop experience.  Here's the problem: even at full commercial release, it still feels like a beta, perhaps even a fairly early beta.  The UI is quite clunky, and I don't even want to talk about the problems I have sometimes trying to adjust a unit's facing.\nFramerates can also be quite terrible, doesn't work at all on my Macbook, only my dedicated gaming PC.  Finally, the "cutscenes" are frankly unprofessional.  Using a model of a character and having it remain static while narrative audio plays is...well, something not really acceptable in 2014.  Maybe in the 90s you could have done something like that, but not now.  I could tolerate the cutscene issue if everything else was superlative, but the clunky controls are really what are killing me.\n\nUltimately, playing the pc game made me want to pull my minis back out and finish painting my pikemen.  They at least got the atmosphere and the theme right.  I'm hoping I'll be able to rewrite this review in a few months for a much more finished product, but we shall see.

Unfortunately that's all I really like about it. It was fun to have a few games because I miss being able to play tabletop and I tried to like this, but gameplay feels too clunky and the menu feels very unintuitive.","April 15","false","3.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Customisation grants it immense potential.\n\nI would like to point out that despite the overall disappointment towards the game by many reviewers, the patches fixed a lot of issues over time as well as adding new stuff, even though some glitches and bugs are still out there and the performance of the game isn't at its best yet.\n\nI am therefore quite confident that in time this game will become what it should be, which is an excellent turn-based tactical game, since the devs really put the effort in it.\n\nbesides the universe is simply fantastic :)\n\nEdit : sadly after so much time it is now very hard to find any excuse for the result. Plus most of the promised stuff is still not out and, we're in 2016, this AI design level is simply a shame to the human brain.","November 21, 2014","false","136.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The core tactical strategy concept seems pretty good, reminiscent of "Valkyria Chronicles." I like the mind-controlled mechs too.\n\nInstead it's an amateur, unfinished mess. If the developers fixed the myriad issues mentioned by others, such as the infuriating camera, terrible UI, abysmal performance and laughable AI. (Amongst other things like the disconcerting cutscenes that should have been animated.) This could be a very good game.","April 25","false","5.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Hell, Mechwarrior didn't do these stuff until MW3(with their expansion packs).\n\nI won this game in a giveaway with its DLC's and I wouldn't had bought this game if I knew that it has game affecting DLCs.\n\nHowever, the concept of gameplay is great, the graphics are beautiful and it could've been one of those successful indie games if it had none of the issues above.\n\nIn conclusion - WhiteMoon Dreams and Privateer Press need to get their s**t together and fix this game or even give this game a whole overhaul, without trying to hand out their hands straight up for cash - because this is not how games made.","April 23","false","12.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Very tough on the hardware though. Not sure if that's entirely justified.\nThe camera flies through buildings, which kind of ruins the immersion. But it's pretty flexible in general, although you can't control the viewing angle, which is a shame.\n\nClunky/vague unit control and UI. Sometimes random things happen, and for some reason I won't be able to have a unit perform an attack. And you can't switch to another unit after having browsed its actions menu, even when it hasn't performed a move/attack yet. XCOM did that better. I guess I find it bothersome having to plan all my units' actions ahead.\nFor some reason it's very difficult or sometimes impossible to select a friendly unit. And I still haven't figured out how to select and view info on enemy units (might be me). There are these elaborate mystic circles to indicate a selectable unit, but they're more messy than helpful.\n\nNo saves/checkpoints in the campaign. I don't mind not being able to save (i.e. cheat) during missions, but I sure mind having to replay an entire mission when I fail. Especially when there are multiple scripted events throughout a mission that change the situation in an unforeseeable way. And let's not mention all the random/endless unit spawns. Wasting literally hours of my time like this is a big con for me.\n\nFairly decent voice acting and story (as far as I've seen).\n\nYes, the missing animations in cutscenes. Guess they ran out of money. Not such a big deal when the gameplay itself is solid. However...\n\nI can't say I'm looking forward to finishing the campaign at this point. I foresee much frustration. So this will probably be it for me. Lots of potential here, but too unpolished to risk wasting hours and hours on.\n\nGet this (on sale) if you're a fan of tabletop games or specifically Warmachine. If you want a casual campaign experience, like me, just don't bother. I got this in a Humble Bundle, so no harm done, really.","May 26","false","6.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The animations buggy, the fps dips. At it's current shape it still should not be a fully released. (Even the patch version says 0.9).\nStill it's strategy turn based games which we have few good ones to chose between. Alot of missions is hard the gamplay intresting (When the animation not convicning you you are turned the wrong way or you managed to deselect a unit thereby skipping a turn) and the mulitplayer is decent.\nMy recomendation for now for anyone waiting to buy it. Wait for the release patch to at least say v 1.0 and the game is on sale.\n\nUpdate, So completed the Campain after giving them ample time to fix it. Gotta say it got a bit of story still not fixed yet. Bad optimization and considering the amount of effort the developer put into it it's sad. Can't reccomend it to anyone that's not really into Warmachines Tactics or have a desprete need to find a turnbased strategy game and can't take som eyesore bugs.","September 29, 2015","false","32.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
