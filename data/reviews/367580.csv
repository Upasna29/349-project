Expect about an hour of thinking in this lovely little project with a minimalist approach.\n\nThe Pros:Great Design - If you've played this king of games, you won't feel anything new. It follows the philosophy of less is more, and for a game that was built around a prototype, it's a great choice. You'll find a simple color scheme, almost no UI, and a generic backing music.\n\nInteresting Gameplay - You have to remap circuit like structures by rotating nodes to guide the signal of your buttons. The goal is to retract the variously shaped bars without them colliding. Think of it as the electrician's lockpicking game.\n\nSelf Cleaning Levels - I love it how when you clear part of a level, the now useless wiring and nodes disappear on their own. It makes following wires easier and lets you concentrate on the remaining part of the puzzle.\n\nDirt Cheap - Honestly, you can't ask for more money on a game that is so short, but damn it, for the one hour of pleasant wiring I've done, I'm glad I bough this dev a coffee.\n\nAchievements - Achievement hunters, rejoice! A single achievement is required, and that is completing the game!\nThe Cons:Short - The game mechanics are awesome, I loved the idea, and I am sad there are only 50 levels of content, which will take you roughly an hour to complete. Custom levels would have been amazing to see here, but sadly, it is not the case.\n\nNo Menus - The game is short enough that you will probably just pass through it in one sitting then you will leave it dusting on the hypothetical shelf until you are bored, so I understand why he didn't bother to include menus, but I still have to deduct points for no options whatsoever. Especially that you have to go through levels one by one. That is to say, if you enjoyed level 35, prepare to increment your way to it!\nConclusionThe game is fun, interesting, and literally costs a cup of coffee. You have nothing to lose, grab it!\n\n\nIf you enjoyed this review and want to see more of my work, consider joining my group and follow my curator page!

As written previously by other players, this game is short and you can complete it quickly. In my opinion I think this game is totally worth the $0.99 that you have to pay. The levels were simple, but became harder at about 35ish. There are only 50 levels currently in this game. I would like to voice my opinion that I wish there were more levels. This could possibly be achieved by maybe opening up level design to the steam community and the workshop. I also hope that what is so far in the game could maybe be an introduciton. Another thing I loved about this game was the simplicity of it. It created a very relaxed enviroment, which the music also contributed to. I would reccomend this to anyone and everyone.","July 10, 2015","true","1.6"," 32 of 33 people (97%) found this review helpful","97","32","33","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gog-protoss/recommended/367580/","gog-protoss","Protoss","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gog-protoss/","4010 products in account","What is Hook?\n\nHook is a minimalistic and short puzzle game where you must hook in hooks. Sounds easy, is it for the most part.\n\nIdea: The idea itself is nice but simple, there might be some unused potential, but overall the concept makes only for an easy, zen-like game. You solve the puzzles because you want to solve them, they are no real brain teasers but rather resolving challenges, such as opening a knot. You have a series of interconnected hooks and lines to them. Your objective is to reel them in in the correct order so no hook touches another one. Later stages give you three tries for each puzzle before it resets. You should not need any of the additional tries anyway. Earlier stages have unlimited tries.\n\nGraphics: The graphics are held entirely in black, grey and white. While I have per se no issues with the graphics, there is one thing that is annoying. More than once I tried to unhook something that I thought to be the next hook but it still was interconnected somehow, so I solved the wrong one. Maybe it is because I get near my thirties, or because I always had some bad eyesight, but to me sometimes it is difficult to see what hooks are connected to what. The solution might have been to color the hooks, although that should be an option and not enforced as it would destroy some graphical charme.\n\nSound: The sound is minimalistic as well, with no artistic value. It is all made to be calm.\n\nControls: The control is done with the mouse. As they are completely intuitive, you spend more time thinking than clicking.\n\n\nRecommended: Yes, but for one dollar or less. There is a free version on Kongregate which can be viewed as a demo, as the author also states on the store page. The game is calming while still managing to be something to think on, but not too much, just the right amount to relax, which is appreciated.\n\nThe game has 50 levels and they are generally short since the concept itself is not allowing for much difficulty. I finished it in just under an hour.\n\n\nVerdict: Calming puzzle game in the Zen philosophy. (The philosophy of Zen is to live in the current moment, neither thinking of the future nor the past.)","September 9, 2015","true","0.9"," 34 of 38 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","34","38","0","1"

Prepare to grimace as an unexpected movement occurs you hadn't planned on occuring happens. But throughout it all, expect to be pleased and gratified each time you solve the puzzles.\n\nNow if you've played Hook before, you may go, "Pfft, I played levels 1-10.... it wasn't all that...." And you'd be right. My first experience with it was rather indifferent. As I first started playing the levels, I said to myself, "This isn't a puzzle game, this is a push the correct button in the right order game.... Meh." But I stuck it out. And I recommend you do too.\n\nThe music is pretty good and relaxing, but as is typical with me, I listened to something else while I was playing. Netflix is a constant unless something takes 100% of my attention.\n\nThe graphics are minimal, but that's all the game needs. Really doesn't need anything flashy. In retrospect it would have been nice to have a negative option, instead of an all white background, with black graphics, an all black background with white graphics, but it's not at all a deal breaker.\n\nThe game itself works essentially like so. Remove the pieces in the order that will not cause them to be hooked on each other, by following the electric lines. The game doesn't actually call them electric lines, but that's how I thought of them. As simple as that sounds, it becomes much harder than initially imaginable as can be seen in my original observations of the game.\n\nIn any case, the game is short, but good for what it is and doesn't claim to be anything more than that.\n\nOverall: 8.5/10 - Sure you might be able to find other ways to spend a dollar, but this is a pretty good one.","May 12","true","3.1"," 24 of 26 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","24","26","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PieceOfMind1/recommended/367580/","PieceOfMind1","PieceOfMind","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PieceOfMind1/","2414 products in account","A short but enjoyable deduction puzzle game.\n\nHook is extremely minimalist. In fact the menu screen is itself the first puzzle of fifty.  In each level you must carefully toggle switches so that when you push one of the dark circles (which you could think of as sending an electric pulse down that wire) then all connected wires will retract their "hook".  I call them "hooks" but it's hard to describe what that means.  They are the bolded lines you see.  If you make a mistake by trying to retract a hook that will run into another one, you start the puzzle again.\n\nThe game is paced extremely well, and even without a tutorial the game is immediately intuitive and new gameplay mechanics (switches mostly) are introduced at just the right times and the player is never left confused about how to proceed.\n\nThe visual aesthetic is perfect for the game.  Everything is black and white but you will never find yourself wishing the game was colourful.  Background music and sound effects won't grab your attention but they don't need to.\n\nThe only real downside is the game's length; People used to puzzle games will likely finish the game in under an hour, where they will get the game's only achievement!  The game is very cheap though so it's reasonable for it to be as short as it is.\n\nOverall, highly recommended!","January 9","true","0.9"," 24 of 27 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","24","27","0","0"

It’s safe to say that I’m glad I did.\n\nThis game is simple, short but satisfying. With 50 levels, it took me around 65 minutes to complete. It definitely won’t keep you busy for long but the time it does, I think you will enjoy it.\n\nI love puzzle games with more unique mechanics. Games like Splice, KAMI and LYNE are always the type of thing I am looking out for. Hook is nice little addition to the group. The mechanics are simple to pick up and get increasingly harder as you go along whilst still being fun to work through.\n\nDespite the praise above even the hardest levels didn’t feel too much of a head scratcher. If you are looking for a more casual puzzle game to play, this may be it. But if you’re looking for a hard-core challenge well you might be disappointed.\n\nEither way this game is great. The music is very chill, the graphics are decent and it was all around a good buy. I paid about 70p for it, so no complaints here!\n\nThis game only has 1 achievement and that’s for completing all the levels. So in terms of getting another perfected game, this one couldn’t be easier.\n\nAll in all it’s a nice little game, I’d definitely recommend it.\n\n\nTL;DR : Short little puzzle game with unique mechanics.

Well now's your chance.\n\nHook is a deceptively simple puzzle game where the object is to clear the field of all sticks.  The sticks don't lay over or under each other but pass through and interfere with each other.  Because of this the order in which you remove the sticks is vitally important.  One mistake and you have to restart the level though the last 10-15 levels allow 3 mistakes.\n\nThe game starts off simple, the sticks don't even overlap, but after a while they interlace and have bumps that must be accounted for.  They also introduce switches to control the flow once you hit the go button or one of the go buttons and even "wireless jump" elements to further complicate matters.  The higher levels often contain 10+ sticks, 10+ switches, multiple paths and multiple wireless jump elements.\n\nHerein lies the weakness in the game.  While it will probably only take you an hour to finish the game, the first 40 of 50 levels feel like tutorials to introduce all the mechanics and once you get to the high level problems, the stars of the show, it's over all too quick.  More of the complex problems would be ideal or some sort of steamworks integration.\n\nAll in all it's still a great little puzzler for the price and well worth a play.","August 15, 2015","true","3.6"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","14","15","0","0"

I was torn on whether to say Yea or Nay to it. Ultimately, I decided to not recommend it—even if it is pretty neat.\n\nPuzzle games are my thing, for sure. Simplistic and minimal? That counts for double. For what this game is, the vibe is absolutely perfect, starting right from the title screen/first level. I have to give props to the game trailer, too. Leaving it to the player to discover what the game is about is very compelling.\n\nHowever, sometimes you have things are too simplistic and too minimal. I'm afraid Hook falls into this category. I completed all 50 levels of the game in 50 minutes. That's all there is. There is nothing for me to go back to. (I wish there was.)\n\nThings don't get satisfactorily difficult until the last 10 levels. To me, the first 30ish levels felt like an expanded tutorial. They built up new concepts nicely, but in the end there are very few levels where you are really challenged on them. In fact, there is one mechanic that is introduced then abandoned after just 2 levels, never to be seen again. Why put it in if you don't have a real test for it later in the game?\n\nI read the reviews for this game beforehandand I knew that I was going to get what amounts to a disposable, one-time use product. You buy it, you use it, you're done with it. I'm satisfied with what I got, but that doesn't mean I'd recommend it to everyone.\n\nHook is a neat game, but it's not a good value. There are many other games, on Steam or on smartphones, that also cost less than a dollar, but they will have much more content and are probably worth your time more than this one is worth your money.","July 8, 2015","false","0.8"," 69 of 120 people (58%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","58","69","120","8","6"

I really enjoyed the game, especially the more advanced latest dozen of levels - I think the game's best aspect is that it doesn't try to sugarcoat itself. It's what it looks like, from the reviews it's easy to see that it's 1-2 hour long, has 50 levels, and the game only cost 1€. I really recommend this to you if you like puzzles,  it's a good deal - especially if you get it during sale, but full price is also a fair amount for it's content.","November 23, 2015","true","2.0"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","1"

You press a button, and whatever that button is connected to will retract.\nNaturally, it starts out as simple as "figure out which of these buttons to press first" but it soon starts layering on more complicated mechanics, such as the titular hooks, rotating connections/corners, segmented endpoints that require a certain order to be untangled, and a couple others.\n\nNow, you might be thinking that sounds a bit too simple, and would naturally just come down to mashing the button in different combinations until you beat the game, but this game is slightly more clever in its design and how it treats failure: Whenever you press the button at the wrong time, the level resets.\n\nEarly on this doesn't really matter much, as it's quick to reset, but as the tangle gets larger and more complicated, losing your progress becomes all the more displeasing, though it never gets frustrating. This is due to the fact that eventually, it will allow you 2 strikes before it fails you.\n\nIt's an unexpected balancing of a difficulty curve that you don't normally see in these sorts of minimalist puzzle games. It helps keep your pace through its 50 puzzles, but it also doesn't quite remove the difficulty or keep that pace the exact same throughout your entire session.\n\nThe full game will end up being about an hour more or less, but like plenty of others have pointed out: it's priced accordingly. And if you're the type of person that needs that "finding the next missing step" itch scratched, I have a feeling you're gonna return to this one after some time has passed.","July 7, 2015","true","0.0"," 14 of 19 people (74%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","74","14","19","2","1"

It's not very challenging, as long as you take your time to think the puzzles through. I'd say it's more relaxing, than anything else.\n\nThe objective of the game is to pull all of the hooks into their "homes," at which point they will disappear into some other dimension. But if you don't pull them in the right order, they get caught on other hooks. To make sure you trigger the right hooks, you must change the direction of the circuit the trigger is connected to. It's all very simple and easy to understand.\n\nThe music for  Hook  is very soothing. It playing in the background, matched with solving puzzles, is super calming. I could listen to it all day, and never tire of it. It gets two thumbs up from me.\n\nOverall,  Hook  is a very nice experience. It's definitely worth the price it's asking for.

Then after that there are two, and three, and before you know it you're navigating diagramatic screens that take some directed thought to solve.

The object of the game is to retract all of the hooks on the screen. You do this by pressing the buttons, and any hooks connected by wires to the buttons will attempt to retract. You need to do this in the correct order, because if any hooks collide and fail to retract, the whole board resets and you have to start over. Later in the game, there will be many hooks connected to one button, and you will be required to manipulate gates to cut the connections to the hooks which shouldn't retract yet.\n\nThe game only has 50 levels. The first 39 levels are practically a tutorial to make sure you understand the mechanics. The real challenge starts with the final 11 levels, which are quite complex, and give you three failing attempts before the board resets instead of just one.\n\nFor a $0.99 game, I was very satisfied. I would recommend it to any puzzle game fans and achievement hunters who would enjoy a momentary lapse into something original, yet simple.","August 25, 2015","true","1.4"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","0"

Minimalist in its design, with only a white background and black lines and buttons for presentation, you’re thrown straight into the puzzle without so much as a tutorial. And that’s okay, you don’t really need a tutorial. Every time a new item is added to the puzzles,  you’re given a very simple version to solve that teaches you what the new symbols do. The basic idea is that you will remove the items in order, taking care none will hook or get stuck with another.\n\nWhen I say the game is minimalist, I do mean it’s minimalist: it doesn’t even have a menu. Normally I’d be pretty annoyed without control over the sound, but in this case, I didn’t need it. Hook’s sound effects and backgrounds music/sound are soft, pleasant, and as relaxing as the rest of the game is.\n\nThe puzzles themselves aren’t difficult, in fact, the game is quite easy and short with only 50 levels, and only the last few levels are more complicated (because of all the ramifications, and not because they’re actually hard) The game even offers you 3 tries on those latter levels, so that you won’t lose at the first mistake.\n\nThe only complaint I had was the windowed mode. Alt+enter did take you out of fullscreen and into window mode, but at the same resolution. I made the mistake of resizing the window on the hopes it would help the resolution aspect, but it only cut off part of my puzzle area; alt+entering back to full screen did not reset this, nor did resizing the window again, so I was forever left with a thin black line at the top and bottom of my game screen that cut off a tiny bit of the puzzles.\nStill, it wasn’t game breaking as I didn’t resize it too small (thankfully).\n\nIf you like these kind of puzzle games (and even though you might not find a huge challenge in this), if you need something relaxing to play then I definitely recommend it. It’s worth the money.\n\n* Key Provided by Developer","October 2, 2015","true","3.9"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

I got this game on Humble Bundle, while it's on sale (which doesn't save much consider the full price is only 1 dollar CDN), yet somehow, a little part of me still feel that that's roughly one dollar I'll never get back ( and perhaps will be wiser spent tossing into a wishing fountain or something). But I really do admire indie developers trying to put out new content and if the developers of this game sees this, please consider the following advice for your next game:\n\nGraphics: Even though Puzzle games rely most heavily on game mechanics, that doesn't mean your player won't notice how bland your graphics are. Even if you just add a few set of color palette and switch it around would definitely make the game that much more visually interesting and engaging.\n\nSoundtrack: If audio editting isn't your strong suit that's fine, but just like graphics, even if you toss a few simple bell tone on it would make it more interesting than what it is now.\n\nInterface: Maybe the game menu is surprisingly absent because you can't do it, in which case it's high time that you educate yourself to fufill that role. But I can't stress how imporant for a game to have basic fundamental option such as a few graphic setting (resolution, window mode, etc), and maybe a proper exit button.\n\nLength: The game only have 50 levels, really? 50!? There are a lot of puzzle games online that revolves around mechanics just as simple and they could easily churn out hundreds of levels; I think this one just shows a lack of creativity, perhaps spending some time online trying out some other puzzle games might give the developers some inspiration on how to design more levels in their future puzzle games.\n\nTL;DR: as much as I would like to recommend this game, you're probably better off surfing one of those online flash game site if you're budget for entertainment is that low.

Generally, they deliberately offer such a short experience so that you really cannot judge how good the game is by its length. You really can't expect much for a buck.\n\nSo what it ultimately boils down to is whether that short experience is worth not only your one euro, one dollar, slightly less than one pound or whatever, but also whether it's worth your time. What you're essentially getting here is one hour's worth of gameplay for your money - maybe a little more if you struggle with logic puzzles.\n\nThe problem with Hook is that the game never really takes off into greatness. You spend the first 25-30 levels asking yourself if this is all that the game has to offer, after which the game starts to up the difficulty slightly, giving you hope that you may eventually be challenged.\n\nMany puzzle fans, sadly, will be disappointed. Hook blows its contingent of new features by the mid-way point and never introduces anything new thereafter except slightly increased complexity in the layouts. And ironically, it's a hook that Hook is missing - you don't get much of an "a-ha" feeling when you solve a puzzle - each one is solved by simple patience and superficial logic, the kind that electronic engineers will doubtless be familiar with from reading circuit diagrams.\n\nHook certainly won't give you the feeling of having wasted your dosh - especially so if you buy it in a sale or bundle. Its contemporary miminalist visual and audio style is serviceable and functional but by no means revolutionary. But it will have you wondering if it was an hour well-spent. And as it spends an hour teasing greater things, it will likely frustrate you that it ultimately doesn't deliver on those "a-ha" moments.","September 7, 2015","false","1.2"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

If you enjoy solving puzzles like picross or sudoku you will probably like it. Essentially, you just set up the hooks so that the free ones will pull and the stuck ones will not pull. It's just a matter of checking to make sure everything is set up right before you click each time. If you like games where you just have to notice a pattern and click the right button, this is for you. Only the later 10-20 puzzles really make you have to concentrate, though.\n\nIt is very short. I finished it in probably about 40 minutes -- I have 1 hour play time but in the middle I did stop to eat dinner and make tea and left the game running. $1 for 40-60 minutes of puzzles may or may not be worth it to you -- considering you can find tons of puzzles with a similar feeling of satisfaction online for free, or buy something like a sudoku or picross book for a few dollars and get way more than 40 minutes of the same type of enjoyment from it, it's kind of steep. But $1 I feel was worth to support the developer, and hopefully they will be inspired to make similar games but with more levels.\n\nThe game teaches you how to play without language or tutorials, which is a very nice design. New concepts will be added slowly and give you time to fiddle with them to learn how they work without having to consult a guide or make too many errors.\n\nThe only complaint I really have is that the entire game is black on white. An inverted option (black background with grey hooks) would have been very nice. Or the ability to select colors yourself by simply editing RGB values or something. Simple menus would be nice. The developer said themselves they were simply too lazy to add a menu, though... So perhaps that is enough to convince some people not to decide to support the developer by buying it.","December 12, 2015","true","1.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Especially considering that it is only $0.99, which is a rediculously low price. This game starts off extremely easy, a bit too easy, but it gradually becomes more difficult after every level. Hook really starts to become difficult once you reach 36, however, almost every level before level 36 are very easy, these levels take no more than 10 - 60 seconds which is way too quick considering these levels take up more than half the game. After then the game really does feel like a relaxing yet challenging puzzle game. The sounds are soothing and soft and the music is so tranquil and beautiful, it really does fit the game perfectly. However, I wish there was a bit more variety to the sounds, as well as more sound tracks just to give the game a bit more variety in terms of audio.\n\nSounds / Music Score: 7.5/10\nGameplay Score: 7/10\n\nOverall Rating: 7.25/10 (72.5% / Good)\n\nI highly recommend this game, it is perfect if you are looking for a relaxing and simple puzzle game that is easy to learn and cheap!

It is definately worth the dollar and you should definetely purchase it if you enjoy puzzle games.","August 5, 2015","true","1.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The basics of the puzzles are that you need to hit a button to remove lines from the board, but you need to make them in a certain order so that the lines do not hit each other. New mechanics like rotating junctions and portals/transmitters are added every few levels to change things up and keep you hooked. Pun intended. There isn't really music as such, more like ambient sounds but given the relaxed nature of the game it fits appropriately.\n\nI'd say the price is about right but some people might think it is too much for a game this short.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Twistorian/recommended/367580/","Twistorian","Twistor","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Twistorian/","4393 products in account","TL;DR: Minimalistic and nice but short, casual puzzle game about untangling hooks.\n\nRarely does a puzzle game start so leisurely. The first couple of levels of Hook are impossible to fail, their sole purpose being to demonstrate core mechanics. After all, a single hook cannot be tangled with itself.\n\nIn Hook bunch of abstract hooks are piled in an elaborate manner to present a puzzle. Your mission is to pick out all hooks one or few at a time without them getting stuck to each other in the process. Pressing a button, connected to a hook by a line, activates the hook to be removed. If it's not obstructed, you are one step closer to success.\n\nHook is well designed. Success is usually not too difficult but it still feels satisfying as you solve a puzzle. All new features are introduced naturally by incredible simple and easy puzzles instead of bulky tutorials or manuals.\n\nA couple of special features spice up the puzzles: there are rotating switches that control which hooks get activated; plus there are "antennae" that transfer the "hook activation signal" like teleporters. These add up to increasingly complicated puzzles.\n\nMost puzzles admit no mistakes. Later on, once the puzzles get larger and more complicated, three mistakes are allowed. The difficulty curve is generally super. Music fits the game well, being a pleasant ambiance mixed with occasional sound of nature, e.g. a bird tweet or a stream.\n\nPerhaps the only thing that the game really falls on is its length: the 50 levels can be beaten in a mere hour. Then again one hour of entertainment for one euro (or equivalent) is pretty adequate to me.","February 29","true","1.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The first levels are obviously a warm up, and I found myself genuinely bored at first, but as time commenced, it really started to challenge. Unfortunately, that challenge didn't come until I was already 80% through. If you play a lot of games like this, it's a breeze. Even if you don't, you just have to look and see how the bigger picture plays out. It's minimalistic entirely, minimal sound outside of ending FX and the hooks retracting. If you screw up, there's no going back - you restart the level. This changes at level 40, where you seem to gain "lives." 3, specifically, indicated by small black circles on the far left of your screen. These will probably be necessary. Gets real convoluted from there onward. Difficulty spike is a bit shocking, even. Like I said, though. Just look at it - it's all right there.

In other games you might complain if something had been reduced or "refined" but in Hook it's been done to reduce the pressure and potential annoyances that are common in other puzzle games. What you end up with is a short, sweet, simple, relaxing and fun step-by-step logical puzzle game.\n\nHighlights\nEverything in Hook from the lack of menu and loading screen to the lack of music and fancy animations exist to serve a purpose. Even simple things like the exact number of 50 levels are symptomatic of the design of this game: Less is more when it's well designed.\n\nThe simplicity and reduction in Hook means it's only about thinking and proceeding and everything is natural, there's no need to think about controls or options, which servers to relax your mind and make it a joy from start to finish.\n\nMistakes and Annoyances\nMy only concern with the title is the short length or lack of content. Hook excels as a simple and relaxing game to play when you have spare time and want something mellow. So not to be able to come back and play more when you're in those moods is a real disappointment.\n\nRecommendations\nHook is priced smartly and correctly. Most games priced under $1 are aimed at being impulse buys and don't feel well polished or lack a lot of what you might expect. Hook doesn't oversell and it's just a plain simple short puzzle game sold at a fair price any time you need something to do for an hour.\n\n* Rainbow Train have a bunch of cool games, prototypes and demos available on their website[www.rainbowtrain.eu] which is well worth a look\n* The initial or prototype version of Hook is still available for free on Kongregate[www.kongregate.com] and offers some timed mechanics which aren't in the Steam version","December 26, 2015","true","1.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The precepts of how the pieces interact are intuitive and the puzzles themselves are skillfully designed, with my only frustration arising from taking longer than was intended to figure out how overlapping pathways do and do not interact. The sound design and music fit well within the overall aesthetic.\n\nThis game does not present real challenge or require creativity. Even the most complex looking levels are fairly simple to sort out by a mental process that ends up mainly being the process of elimination and following lines, and there is generally only one way to solve each puzzle. I recommend this game for someone who enjoys the simple satisfaction of carefully putting things in place for an experience rather like a jigsaw puzzle. There's nothing here that you will force you to return repeatedly or develop a novel solution.\n\nI doubt using the same puzzle building blocks would allow for the addition of new and deeply challenging problems. In any case I would rather see more of the same: simple satisfying puzzles that can help you clear your mind.\n\nAll in all, worth your dollar.","July 7, 2015","true","1.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It’s Short, Cheap, Minimalist Fun. Genre: Minimalist Puzzle Game\nDeveloped & Published by: Maciej Targoni, Wojciech Wasiak and Rainbow Train.\nPlatform: Windows, Mac, Linux.\nBusiness Model: Single Purchase\nCopy Purchased by Myself Overall Gameplay Thoughts\nHook is a short minimalist puzzle game. It’s so minimalist that there isn’t even a main menu. The game just throws you right into the first simple puzzle to explain it’s main mechanic. This is a game about figuring out which order to push all of the buttons on the screen. Each button is tied to a hook(s) or line(s) that must be retracted in the right order. What it then does is explore how far it can push that mechanic through a mess of lines that have to be traced through to make sure you don’t activate any other hooks that you don’t want to. Eventually, there are switches that change which lines are affected by a button press that you have to work around. You only get one chance to fail each puzzle up until halfway through where the game gives you three chances to fail. In total there are 50 puzzles that you can do in about an hour. Which seems to be a decent length considering what the developer was working with. I’d say my only criticism of the pacing is that the puzzles don’t get really challenging until the 30th one, for myself anyway.\n\nPC Settings\nThere aren’t any PC settings in Hook. At all. The game seems to auto-detect what the resolution is. It runs at 60FPS. That’s all there is to say. It works on Linux just fine. I’m willing to forgive it considering it’s short length but yeah, there’s nothing to talk about here.\n\nFinal Thoughts\nYeah, so that’s my thoughts on Hook. There’s not a lot to examine or talk about in Hook. It’s a well done minimalist puzzle game that costs $0.99 and doesn’t pretend to be anything else. Kudos to the devs for being straightforward on the marketing. So, if you need another one of these, give Hook a look. An hour of casual entertainment for 99 cents, not a bad deal. Recommended.\n\nRead this review and more about other minimalist puzzles on A Paladin Without A Crusade[kingisaaclinksr.com]","March 18","true","0.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's short, but well priced. Its ideal use is probably downloaded from the google app store and played while you're waiting for your flight, because it reminds me of some short puzzle book you pick up at an airport book store - except it isn't $1,500.\n\nMinimalist is probably the right word because it gets to the point of what you are there for without a needless amount of useless and annoying user interface.  Controls for the switches are easy and intuitive and gives you easy walkthrough levels to learn how things are going to work when it starts to get complicated. Progress is saved after you unlock the next level in case you buy this game two hours after you should have been in bed and realize that might have been a mistake.\n\nSome of the higher level puzzles look daunting, but honestly all of them are doable as long as you commit yourself to sitting down and thinking about things before you do something stupid. Failed attempts restart the level, but they even realize this might be frustrating at high levels and give you basically "three lives" before a restart. That's nice.\n\nBetween its plesant experience and price, I do recommend this game highly.","February 23","true","2.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/brokenneckman/recommended/367580/","brokenneckman","Broken Neck Man","http://steamcommunity.com/id/brokenneckman/","40 products in account","The Premise: Hook is a game of circuitry-style puzzles.  The goal is to close a circuit between an activator button (a solid black circle) and a "reel" (symbolized by a bold line or bold hook).  Once a reel is connected to a button, then the reel retracts, if it is not prevented from doing so by another reel (watch the video if that doesn't make sense).  The circuits get progressively more complicated.\n\nMy Opinion: I loved this.  I have never spent $.99 and gotten more enjoyment.  The puzzles were really well done.  I hope there is a sequel.  I bought this game as a gift for someone and they enjoyed it, too.  It took me about 100 minutes to beat all 50 puzzles, and that's with me going slow.  Try happily spending 100 minutes for only $.99 cents somewhere else.\n\nIf you forced me to complain about something, I think the soundtrack got a little annoying after a while.\n\n10/10","July 7, 2015","true","1.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

A neat little puzzle game that's primarily about sequences, finding the right way to set all the pieces so that you can retract hooks without colliding into other hooks. The puzzles start out simple but by the end have a fair bit of complexity and new mechanics are added the entire way to keep things fresh. It's not particularly long (50 puzzles that I completed in 35 minutes, according to steam) but for the price, I'd say it's fair. The graphic style is simple but effective and the music is quite relaxing and enjoyable. Fun stuff.","July 7, 2015","true","5.0"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Having it onscreen was pleasant. That's largely why I aquired it.\n\nBut I didn't particularly enjoy playing the puzzles. Many of the levels, perhaps half, weren't difficult at all. Then the game seems to try and generate difficulty through complexity, meaning that the main reason you'd fail at a puzzle is not that you don't know what you need to do, but that you simply have trouble telling what is conected to what in the jumble of black lines on-screen. This makes the game more about repeatedly tracing lines than about figuring things out. A few levels did involve some sort of insight, but only a few, and always insight of the same sort.\n\nAlso, the game is very short. I beat it in what Steam tells me is 64 minutes of play time, and I was AFK for at least 10 of those, probably more. (So that's < 54 minutes from start to finish without any prior familiarity with the game.)\n\nAll that is not to say it's an aweful game. This might be some people's cup of tea, and the price is right. But for minimal puzzlers I'd rather play something else.","August 15, 2015","false","1.1"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

Their's no need to make a ♥♥♥♥ out of me for saying this.)\n\nA game that only takes up half an hour of your time can't really be classified as a game (but rather a 'mini-game').\nThe only reason i brought this game was because it was the second most popular game that was under £4. I realised that not much went into this game, for example their was only one achievment available which was to complete the (mini)game,\ntheir was also no pause menu or main menu which would've been easy to program in about 1 hour (trust me, i know this because i program myself).\n\nMy verdict of this is that (mini)games such as these should not be on steam and rather on google play or 'the app store'.\nSteam games are for users to be interested in the immense dilema of each game (Story wise) and mini games such as these should be on your phone for when your bored and want to do something to do to pass some time, This game would be brilliant on the phone or any portable device and i know that because this is already quite a popular mini game and these are my only issues with it.\n\nThank you for spending your time reading this, i hope this feedback can get to the developer.\n\n","April 1","false","0.5"," 18 of 35 people (51%) found this review helpful","51","18","35","0","1"

It offers 50 challenges that introduce new challenges like intermingled lines, hooks, wireless connections, and rotatable connector thingies at a quick pace keeping things interesting. You have three tries for a puzzle before it resets which I initially thought would be frustrating but it does make the push of a button pretty tense sometimes, but you do find yourself back into the downright maze-like puzzles. The minimalist design keeps the game very clear, although a little indication of where the current is flowing through in the moment would be nice to know where you got it wrong.

It offers 50 challenges that introduce new challenges like intermingled lines, hooks, wireless connections, and rotatable connector thingies at a quick pace keeping things interesting. You have three tries for a puzzle before it resets which I initially thought would be frustrating but it does make the push of a button pretty tense sometimes, but you do find yourself back into the downright maze-like puzzles. The minimalist design keeps the game very clear, although a little indication of where the current is flowing through in the moment would be nice to know where you got it wrong. But maybe that's the challenge. Beating the game took around an hour but for -,99 I can recommend it. Hopefully we'll see more from the developer, who clearly has an idea of constructiing, designing and pacing a puzzle game.","July 7, 2015","true","0.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I've played much more challenging games on websites like Newgrounds or Kongregate, with much more content and even much more options. OPTIONS.\n\nI can not stress this enough, if you develop for PC you MUST have at LEAST some basic windowed/fullscreen options in addition to sound options.

I would't reccomend playing this around friends, as there is some peaceful serenity that comes with this game that is disturbed by other people. So play it alone for the best results.

Like that time you went fishing and wound up catching not a fish, nor seaweed, but instead caught your pal who happened to be standing behind you when you started to cast your line. This game is exactly like that moment. However, this time the hook is already "hooked", and... it's your job to unhook it. Be careful though, if you make one wrong move, you'll have to start all over (on the level that is).                                    Note: There arn't actually any fishing hooks, people, or fish in this game (that I've seen) and everything I said was used as an example (except that it's fun :)) and also... yes, my happy face does have a double chin.","July 12, 2015","true","2.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The puzzles, whilst not especially challenging, are rewarding enough that I felt compelled to blast through them all in one sitting. It’s shortness is something of a detraction, especially considering that the addition of a level editor and a way to share user created levels would ensure a near endless supply of content. Still for the asking price I don’t think anyone will really mind the lack of content as $1 for 1 hour of entertainment is pretty good by anyone’s standards.\n\nRead my full review here: https://www.therefinedgeek.com.au/index.php/2015/07/17/hook-short-and-sweet/","July 16, 2015","true","1.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The music in this game isn't anything special but, for what the game is, it's calming and simple, adding the the simplicity of the game.

It's hard to give it a bad review at 99 cents, it'll fill an hour... but there's no repeat value or anything deeper.\n\nYou'd be much better off getting a game like LYNE which has some similar mechanics and ideas, but has hundreds of levels plus randomly spawned challenges daily.\n\nThere's just too little here to reccomend.

You have completed the level when all the thick grey lines have been retracted away and all that is left is the switches and buttons.\n\nit is easy going at first but as the levels progress and new features/mechanics are introduced it becomes trickier to solve these puzzles, but i found that it never got to the point where i was stressing over if i would ever solve it. To me it was the perfect combination of difficulty and peace with the soft sounds of a forest in the background and the piano making an entrance every once in a while, to me it made my mind think clearly and not cluttered with the stress of the outside world.\n\nI loved this small puzzle game and i would recomend it if you like puzzles or not and i wish for the developer to make more games/ levels like it/for it. It is a really good stress reliever, time passer and if you have any spare coin lying around i really recommend you buy this game. It looks simple, but it is fun and very relaxing.","July 9, 2015","true","5.6"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","25","1","4","0","0"

The puzzles are basically of the form "find one of the few available moves, set things up to make only that move". In a puzzle or two it's occasionally impossible to make an arbitrary single move, but that just means the sreach for an available path is more tedious. Basically, there's almost no depth from the beginning to the end.","May 15","false","3.2"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

You're activating electricity through clicking on a power supply button. The electricity will flow through the wire to its gate/object/goal. The object which is connected to the wire will slide backwards and disappear. This will free other objects which now can be connected to free others and so on. There are a hand full of object types you can interact with: a simple line, a curve, a Y junction and three types of wireless transponder to solve the puzzles.\n\nPros:\n+ charming concept\n+ artwork fits\n+ smooth soundtrack\n+ smooth rise of difficulty\n\nCons:\n- not difficult at all\n- only 50 level\n- with 1h a really short play time\n- too expensive for this play time (and i brought it on sale for 0,99€)\n(- missing animation to see where the electricity flows)\n(- missing option to control the animation speed)\n(- missing other control objects)\n(- missing a better level navigator to jump directly to a level)\n\nSuggestions:\n~ the game would be much cooler with more levels, with more upcoming freaky puzzles and with more difficulty\n~ another improvement would be an animation where you see the electricity flowing and a button to control the animation speed\n~ the last idea would be to create more control objects\n: forming object, where electricity changes its color or form\n: infrared objects, where electricity will be ported from one place to another but only vertical or horizontal\n: timing objects, where the divided electricity needs to be timed to get to its gate\n: etc\n\nAs you can see there is a lot of potential, but it's currently not really used to be a fully-fledged game.\n\nNot Recommended, even if it's on sale, because it lacks content really hard.\n\n4/10","September 14, 2015","false","1.0"," 1 of 8 people (13%) found this review helpful","13","1","8","0","0"

Farther into the game new mechanics are introduced through pseudo-tutorial levels; nothing is explicitly explained to you, but the levels are very easy to complete so that you can easily understand the new mechanic before going into a difficult level with the same mechanic.\n\nAfter 1 hour of play time, I can highly recommend this game.","December 20, 2015","true","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You have to route "power" from a button to the various devices to remove them, via switches. Catch is that if you touch another component in the process, you have to start over. After the first few, it gets easy to see which component needs to go first. Some of these puzzles are real doozys ( Doozies?) and had me doing a double take ( or triple).  It's a good puzzler, good exercise for the brain. A t 50 levels and only 1 achievement to speak of, it isnt terrible.  I do think more could be done with it, maybe trading cards, challenges (ex. race the clock, race friends), a design your Hook might be a nice touch.  I would even suggest a story could be made out of this but thats just me.\n\nshort version: give a shot, see for yourself.

It's a fairly simple puzzle game that goes from quite simple to complicated (at around level 37 if you're playing and wondering when its going to get hard) (insert obligatory ♥♥♥♥♥ joke here). Very nice game that you should definitely drop a buck on.\n\nThe puzzles are very intriguing in a 'if I press a button, how do I only move what I want' and are usually quite challenging in a neat way. Some of the later levels get a little convoluted and I found myself having more problems understanding the puzzle than I did solving it. All the mechanics are simple to understand and typically have one introduced every 4 levels or so, apart from one point where you have 2 more difficult mechanics introduced in following levels which is when the difficulty ramps up, would've like 3 or 4 levels inbetween to truly make the most out of each,\n\nOnly a few small things that affect gameplay in no way. First, theres no menu or ability to edit noise volume (that I saw anyway). The music is nice, but I would've preferred just to have rainymood.com going in background. Secondly, a Level selection option seems mandatory in a game like this, but the only option is to go through levels one by one, even if it is a single playthrough sort of game it can be exasperating, I was hoping to look back on simpler times by level 46 and found I'd have to go level by level, no thanks.\n\nWell worth the slight thinking induced haze im in right now\n\n9/10, buy this game its only a dollar","December 9, 2015","true","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a short game, but that does not detract from the experience in the slightest. All of the puzzles feel doable from the very beginning of seeing the complex gordian-knot-esque amalgamation of wires and the titular hooks and straight lines.  The game is never fustrating because every puzzle builds upon another and there are no puzzles that feel unfair or out of left field with their solutions. The music, while being a loop, creates a calm atmosphere that creates a very positive enviroment for solving the puzzle. Overall, the game feels tight and has no loose ends.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/YanterCZECH/recommended/367580/","YanterCZECH","YanterCZE","http://steamcommunity.com/id/YanterCZECH/","25 products in account","What is Hook?\n\nHook is a minimalistic and short puzzle game where you must hook in hooks. Sounds easy, is it for the most part.\n\nIdea: The idea itself is nice but simple, there might be some unused potential, but overall the concept makes only for an easy, zen-like game. You solve the puzzles because you want to solve them, they are no real brain teasers but rather resolving challenges, such as opening a knot. You have a series of interconnected hooks and lines to them. Your objective is to reel them in in the correct order so no hook touches another one. Later stages give you three tries for each puzzle before it resets. You should not need any of the additional tries anyway. Earlier stages have unlimited tries.\n\nGraphics: The graphics are held entirely in black, grey and white. While I have per se no issues with the graphics, there is one thing that is annoying. More than once I tried to unhook something that I thought to be the next hook but it still was interconnected somehow, so I solved the wrong one. Maybe it is because I get near my thirties, or because I always had some bad eyesight, but to me sometimes it is difficult to see what hooks are connected to what. The solution might have been to color the hooks, although that should be an option and not enforced as it would destroy some graphical charme.\n\nSound: The sound is minimalistic as well, with no artistic value. It is all made to be calm.\n\nControls: The control is done with the mouse. As they are completely intuitive, you spend more time thinking than clicking.\n\n\nRecommended: Yes, but for one dollar or less. There is a free version on Kongregate which can be viewed as a demo, as the author also states on the store page. The game is calming while still managing to be something to think on, but not too much, just the right amount to relax, which is appreciated.\n\nThe game has 50 levels and they are generally short since the concept itself is not allowing for much difficulty. I finished it in just under an hour.\n\n\nVerdict: Calming puzzle game in the Zen philosophy. (The philosophy of Zen is to live in the current moment, neither thinking of the future nor the past.)","October 2, 2015","true","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/YanterCZECH/recommended/367580/","YanterCZECH","YanterCZE","http://steamcommunity.com/id/YanterCZECH/","25 products in account","What is Hook?\n\nHook is a minimalistic and short puzzle game where you must hook in hooks. Sounds easy, is it for the most part.\n\nIdea: The idea itself is nice but simple, there might be some unused potential, but overall the concept makes only for an easy, zen-like game. You solve the puzzles because you want to solve them, they are no real brain teasers but rather resolving challenges, such as opening a knot. You have a series of interconnected hooks and lines to them. Your objective is to reel them in in the correct order so no hook touches another one. Later stages give you three tries for each puzzle before it resets. You should not need any of the additional tries anyway. Earlier stages have unlimited tries.\n\nGraphics: The graphics are held entirely in black, grey and white. While I have per se no issues with the graphics, there is one thing that is annoying. More than once I tried to unhook something that I thought to be the next hook but it still was interconnected somehow, so I solved the wrong one. Maybe it is because I get near my thirties, or because I always had some bad eyesight, but to me sometimes it is difficult to see what hooks are connected to what. The solution might have been to color the hooks, although that should be an option and not enforced as it would destroy some graphical charme.\n\nSound: The sound is minimalistic as well, with no artistic value. It is all made to be calm.\n\nControls: The control is done with the mouse. As they are completely intuitive, you spend more time thinking than clicking.\n\n\nRecommended: Yes, but for one dollar or less. There is a free version on Kongregate which can be viewed as a demo, as the author also states on the store page. The game is calming while still managing to be something to think on, but not too much, just the right amount to relax, which is appreciated.\n\nThe game has 50 levels and they are generally short since the concept itself is not allowing for much difficulty. I finished it in just under an hour.\n\n\nVerdict: Calming puzzle game in the Zen philosophy. (The philosophy of Zen is to live in the current moment, neither thinking of the future nor the past.)","October 2, 2015","true","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/YanterCZECH/recommended/367580/","YanterCZECH","YanterCZE","http://steamcommunity.com/id/YanterCZECH/","25 products in account","What is Hook?\n\nHook is a minimalistic and short puzzle game where you must hook in hooks. Sounds easy, is it for the most part.\n\nIdea: The idea itself is nice but simple, there might be some unused potential, but overall the concept makes only for an easy, zen-like game. You solve the puzzles because you want to solve them, they are no real brain teasers but rather resolving challenges, such as opening a knot. You have a series of interconnected hooks and lines to them. Your objective is to reel them in in the correct order so no hook touches another one. Later stages give you three tries for each puzzle before it resets. You should not need any of the additional tries anyway. Earlier stages have unlimited tries.\n\nGraphics: The graphics are held entirely in black, grey and white. While I have per se no issues with the graphics, there is one thing that is annoying. More than once I tried to unhook something that I thought to be the next hook but it still was interconnected somehow, so I solved the wrong one. Maybe it is because I get near my thirties, or because I always had some bad eyesight, but to me sometimes it is difficult to see what hooks are connected to what. The solution might have been to color the hooks, although that should be an option and not enforced as it would destroy some graphical charme.\n\nSound: The sound is minimalistic as well, with no artistic value. It is all made to be calm.\n\nControls: The control is done with the mouse. As they are completely intuitive, you spend more time thinking than clicking.\n\n\nRecommended: Yes, but for one dollar or less. There is a free version on Kongregate which can be viewed as a demo, as the author also states on the store page. The game is calming while still managing to be something to think on, but not too much, just the right amount to relax, which is appreciated.\n\nThe game has 50 levels and they are generally short since the concept itself is not allowing for much difficulty. I finished it in just under an hour.\n\n\nVerdict: Calming puzzle game in the Zen philosophy. (The philosophy of Zen is to live in the current moment, neither thinking of the future nor the past.)","October 2, 2015","true","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The learning curve absolutely fit my playstyle.\nThe game ends after 50 puzzles - which makes an average of 1 minute per puzzle. Taking money into account, I paid about 2 cents per puzzle.

Which is obviously why I greatly enjoy puzzle games, because they fill me with a sense of intelligence after overcoming certain particularly difficult puzzles. It sort of gives me the feeling that I’m smarter than whoever came up with these challenges in the first place. And I know that this is a very inaccurate representation of people who make puzzle games, because I realize that coming up with these difficult brainteasers in the first place requires an intellect far greater than mine in the first place.\n\nOne of my favorite ways to interact with puzzles is if they require spatial awareness. The goal of each level in Hook is to untangle the mess of connections you see before you. But since it’s a plain 2D affair, it’s more reminiscent of electrical circuit diagrams than anything else. And it also works quite the same way. You have the equivalent of logic gates available to you in order to steer the “electricity” from your button to the appropriate elements. And since all the elements are interlocked in some way, shape or form, you have to keep track which piece has to be removed next. One wrong move, one incorrect decision means that you’ll be trying to remove more than just that one hook you had it out for and send you frantically going over all of your connections again.\n\nDon’t be fooled by the deceptively simple design of the title, it does have quite a few hard puzzles to solve. Unfortunately, to get to them, you’ll be treated to around 30 to 40 levels of mostly very simple puzzles and tutorials that you’ll breeze through without much stopping you. But the final 10 levels – and yes, the game contains a total of 50 levels – can test your patience quite a bit and require a lot of preparatory work, before you even touch one single logic gate.\n\nIt’s also unfortunate that the game is completely devoid of an options menu. There isn’t much to complain about the performance that would require an extensive selection of settings, but basic features like resolution and sound options would’ve been much appreciated.\n\nIf the price were any higher than what the developers are currently asking for – which, for the record, is $1 – I’d probably have more qualms over recommending this short little title, but as it stands, you could spend that amount on a lot of worse entertainment that doesn’t tickle your brain to the extent Hook does. So yeah, I’m willing to give this short little game a recommendation, because it’s flawlessly executed, elegant and simple in design, visually and aurally pleasing and doesn’t require a big investment for the privilege. The only real downside is that I would’ve liked some more levels. But in the end, isn’t that really a compliment if you want more of the same out of a title?","August 10, 2015","true","0.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

At higher levels the original puzzles are tricky without being super difficult, and the minimalist style and subtle music really helps one to zone out for a bit. I definitely recommend playing this game when you have to take your mind off stressful things for a while, it gives you something else to focus on in a relaxing, mellow way. It's worth the full price, it's an afforadable gift, and it's actually fun.\n\nMy single complaint is that the concept isn't taken further or deep enough. After you complete a few puzzles, new tricks are added in a thoughtful way that teaches you problem-solving and increases the difficulty.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/JacquesLeSauve/recommended/367580/","JacquesLeSauve","JacquesLeSauve","http://steamcommunity.com/id/JacquesLeSauve/","591 products in account","If you like rods then this game has you covered! As the game itself is so eager to stress, Hook is a short puzzler based on a web game prototype remade for Steam with 50 original, format-specific challenges. Looking not too dissimilar to a monochromatic circuit diagram, a series of sexy, sexy rods are laid out across the screen, connected by not so sexy pathways to thoroughly unappealing buttons. When these buttons are fiddled with, they retract the rods and remove them from play, taking the button and pathway with it. Remove them all to pass to the next challenge.\n\nThe catch is that some rods cross through one another, or have sweet curves surrounding the tips of other rods. If a button is pressed for a rod that isn't clear of all other rods then they bang hard against each other and force you to restart the puzzle (though, later, more difficult ones allow you three bangs before you're out). Remove them in the right order to gradually free them all up and reach the white screen climax.\n\nAlong the way they make it harder for you by adding things like buttons that deshaft multiple rods simultaneously, or pathways that can be altered, or having buttons and rods that aren't directly touching each other but are instead activated over distance remotely. But as complicated as this all sounds, in practice it's a relatively straightforward task to work out which order to tackle everything, or in a worse case scenario, it's pretty simple to figure everything out through a process of elimination as you push on these mysterious little buttons and try to understand just what the hell they do.\n\nIt's a fairly basic game that tickles your mind a little without taxing it too much, and in the hour it took for me to complete, I had fun at every point without ever feeling stressed out or frustrated, as can sometimes be the case with other puzzle games. It's short and minimal, but that's reflected in the low price that makes it an easy proposition to take a chance on. Hopefully this is just the start and more challenges are planned, as I'd gladly invest in future puzzle packs if they were released periodically for the same price until I either ran out of money or stopped being so interested in rods, that's how much I enjoyed this. I guess you could say I'm, ahem... hooked!... Please don't ever tell anyone I said that, this is just between you and me, OK?

And then it introduces switches.\n\nEventually in around the last ten levels, you get 3 try's to complete the level, instead of the usual 1 try, which helped me quite a bit.\nThe game only has 50 levels, which is more than enough for $1, especially with the work that has been put in to make these levels challenging enough to not be boringly easy, but not too hard as to make you want to rage quit.\n\nAll in all, this game is really, really good, but my only complaint about this game is how short it is. It took around 1.5 hrs to complete with no help or walkthroughs, but I would really love to see some sort of map editor and Steam Workshop support for this game.","September 5, 2015","true","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There are buttons, wires, and hooks. When you click a button, all the hooks to which it is connected by a wire will try to retract. If one hook hits another in the process of trying to retract, you fail. You have very limited ability to rework the wires, so the puzzle is in working out how to set up the wires so that you can retract the hooks in the correct sequence.\n\nThere are fifty puzzles. It seems to take most players a bit over an hour to complete the entire game, so as you can guess you'll be ripping through most stages very quickly. Hook never gets especially deep, though, so it's probably for the best that the game ends while it still feels relatively fresh. It's also just a dollar, and an hour of entertainment for that little is actually pretty good value.\n\nIn short, if you have seventy or eighty minutes to kill and are in the mood for light puzzles, then Hook can fill that niche quite nicely.","March 20","true","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I read another reviewer say they finished it in 1 hour 30 minutes, I finished it in around 46 minutes. This included the time I spent in it when I first started it up to find it's a fullscreen game with a white background. I couldn't stand staring at that for long, so I tried a couple of things and discovered Alt+Enter worked in making the game run windowed. It's clear, however, that though the game re-renders itself fine if you make the window smaller, it's not made for this, as it made it much harder to tell which of two lines was the one that went through the other. The game is also fairly easy. Going through the 50 puzzles, the first one to really stump me was puzzle 49. I then proceeded to do puzzle 50 very quickly without faults.\n\nIt's a tentative recommendation. It is a good kind of puzzle game, and cheap, but it is over fast, and also has no replay value that I can see.","September 1, 2015","true","1.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There are buttons, wires, and hooks. When you click a button, all the hooks to which it is connected by a wire will try to retract. If one hook hits another in the process of trying to retract, you fail. You have very limited ability to rework the wires, so the puzzle is in working out how to set up the wires so that you can retract the hooks in the correct sequence.\n\nThere are fifty puzzles. It seems to take most players a bit over an hour to complete the entire game, so as you can guess you'll be ripping through most stages very quickly. Hook never gets especially deep, though, so it's probably for the best that the game ends while it still feels relatively fresh. It's also just a dollar, and an hour of entertainment for that little is actually pretty good value.\n\nIn short, if you have seventy or eighty minutes to kill and are in the mood for light puzzles, then Hook can fill that niche quite nicely.","March 20","true","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You remove an object by clicking on a black circle which is connected via a matrix to each object. You are able to affect which parts of the matrix are connected so its important to make sure you are connected to the next object(s) that needs to be removed but not connected to the objects which should not (i.e. will be hooked as you try to remove them)\n\nThere are a total of 50 levels and it took me around an hour to complete them all.\n\nThere are no time or other pressures. The only restriction is that you can only make 3 mistakes before you are forced to replay the current puzzle from the beginning. Although I made the odd mistake I never had to restart a level.\n\nI doubt whether there is any replay value in the game as there is only a single achievement for completing the game\n\nProsShort\nThe difficulty curve was well managed\nRelaxing to play (no time etc. pressures)ConsOnly plays in full screen modeMarks Out Of 5\n5) Must have - stop whatever you're playing now and play this\n4) Worth the asking price and considering as your next purchase3) Maybe purchase if you're stuck for choosing your next game or mildly discounted\n2) Only purchase if it is heavily discounted\n1) Not worth getting even if given away free\n\nThe best thing I can say about this game is that I'd instantly purchase a follow up :)\n\nWhere I got the game from\nI bought this as part of the [Indie Gala](https://www.indiegala.com/) Friday Special Bundle 26.\n\nPlatform Played On\nIntel Pentium G3258 Anniversary Edition, 8Gb RAM, Palit GTX 750, Windows 10, EasyAcc Mouse & Steelseries MERC keyboard.\n\nMy best guess for a  PEGI Rating\n3: I can't see any reason to raise it above this.

Which is obviously why I greatly enjoy puzzle games, because they fill me with a sense of intelligence after overcoming certain particularly difficult puzzles. It sort of gives me the feeling that I’m smarter than whoever came up with these challenges in the first place. And I know that this is a very inaccurate representation of people who make puzzle games, because I realize that coming up with these difficult brainteasers in the first place requires an intellect far greater than mine in the first place.\n\nOne of my favorite ways to interact with puzzles is if they require spatial awareness. The goal of each level in Hook is to untangle the mess of connections you see before you. But since it’s a plain 2D affair, it’s more reminiscent of electrical circuit diagrams than anything else. And it also works quite the same way. You have the equivalent of logic gates available to you in order to steer the “electricity” from your button to the appropriate elements. And since all the elements are interlocked in some way, shape or form, you have to keep track which piece has to be removed next. One wrong move, one incorrect decision means that you’ll be trying to remove more than just that one hook you had it out for and send you frantically going over all of your connections again.\n\nDon’t be fooled by the deceptively simple design of the title, it does have quite a few hard puzzles to solve. Unfortunately, to get to them, you’ll be treated to around 30 to 40 levels of mostly very simple puzzles and tutorials that you’ll breeze through without much stopping you. But the final 10 levels – and yes, the game contains a total of 50 levels – can test your patience quite a bit and require a lot of preparatory work, before you even touch one single logic gate.\n\nIt’s also unfortunate that the game is completely devoid of an options menu. There isn’t much to complain about the performance that would require an extensive selection of settings, but basic features like resolution and sound options would’ve been much appreciated.\n\nIf the price were any higher than what the developers are currently asking for – which, for the record, is $1 – I’d probably have more qualms over recommending this short little title, but as it stands, you could spend that amount on a lot of worse entertainment that doesn’t tickle your brain to the extent Hook does. So yeah, I’m willing to give this short little game a recommendation, because it’s flawlessly executed, elegant and simple in design, visually and aurally pleasing and doesn’t require a big investment for the privilege. The only real downside is that I would’ve liked some more levels. But in the end, isn’t that really a compliment if you want more of the same out of a title?","August 10, 2015","true","0.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
