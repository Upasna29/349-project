I've already unlocked a second set of tracks, and a second tier of bikes of which there are 5 as far as i can see. the tracks are pretty big and take a while to make a loop around the entire circuit. The sense of speed is what really stands out, I was using a Oculus DK2 VR headset, and the environment really whips by, when you come close to the walls you really feel like you're in danger.\n\nI will look forward to unlocking more of this game and beating the other races. It looks like there are over 12 tracks to race on, so still quite a bit of content left for me to discover.","May 27","true","0.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

For sure there is some realism in the contact with other bikers. The game is not forgiving at all when it comes to collsisions with other racers, but I feel that it is fairly acurate to what would actually happen, so even though it makes the game more difficult, I feel that its justified.\n\nIn all I think that I will keep coming back to this game when I need a bike racing fix. Theres something that is more freeing and exciting with cycle racing that I just dont get the same feeling when I'm playing a car racing sim.","May 27","true","1.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This game has nowhere near the level of playability, physics, and refinement  (yes I get it's early access) of the MotoGP and Ride games from Milestone (which are both far from perfect).  Here's my experience so far with this game.\n\nLoad game, main menu, no career mode as stated in the description, see a very limited option for races, select easy race 1 oval, choose default bike (only option) and go, despite the decent graphics (in highest setting), surprised at the primitiveness of the race mode, blew by the computer racers after about 3 seconds and lapped the oval 3 times without brakes (minus crashing once into the incredibly slow AI before finishing).\n\nTried another race - california circuit, started out passing a bunch of slow AI until running into a clusterf*ck of AI that crashed into each other.  Physics were very difficult to manage on circuit course, and the AI lumped together and crashed every single turn making it impossible to pass without crashing.  Eventually respawned outside a barrier, unable to get back on track, then kept uncontrollably crashing then finally falling through the graphics into a bottomless pit.\n\nEnded up quitting after 7 minutes.  I want my money back.  Game needs a ridiculuos amount of work.\n\nEdit: I have the non-VR version of the game.","March 5","false","0.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"

If you are a fan of motorcycle racing, you will find a lot to like here. The different racing catagories are divided by CC class, and the courses for the most part are road courses.\n\nThh mechanics are simple, you have gas and brake as well as gear changes. The AI is basic, but creates enough of a barrier ro just breezing through the race without any obstacles. You have to be really careful in passing, if you bounce off of one of the other racers, you will immediately loose your balance and fall off the bike. This adds a ton to the challenge.\n\nOverall, I think that Superbike is a success, I will remain a significant challenge while I try to complete all of the other tracks and unlcoks the remaining content in the game.","May 28","true","1.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
