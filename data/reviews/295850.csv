Just this snippet:\n“A city gone mad with violence and the mass murder of its people. Your choices can either lead you to the ultimate destruction of this fallen metropolis, or the demise of a vicious butcher. Will you save this city as promised or will you fall prey to the killer within?”\nAlong with the system requirements.\n\nRather baffling I tried looking up the Developer website, only to find that they have no site. Next I tried the Publisher. They didn’t even list the game, so I emailed them just to confirm the game is from them.\n\nAs it turns out Vlad the Impaler is a choose your own adventure graphic novel with some light RPG elements. A rather interesting concept to say the least, and instantly made me think of the old Goosebumps horror books I read as a child.\n\nDetermined to get into the think of it and create a powerful character I was surprised to find that you only have three classes to choose from, and you’re unable to really customise them in anyway.\nYou have the explorer, essentially a rogue, the warrior, and mage. A rather standard trio in RPG games. Sadly you’re unable to mix and match them or even their attribute points. Which can only be altered in gameplay due to dialogue choices and events.\n\nThe main mechanic is choosing your own adventure by being presented with several areas to wander in, and occasionally have two choices to choose from. Yes, only two. A rather tiny amount for a game that so heavily relies on user choice as its core mechanic.\n\nEven so the game and story is riddled with inconsistencies, and ultimately your choices have little to no true bearing on the game or its conclusion.\nI’ve often finished a chapter without realising simply by exploring an area, as the each chapter has a set amount of ‘turns’ or clicks you can make. Thereby shooing you along further into the game while feeling unsatisfied and wanting more of the game world. This is where the inconsistencies hit you quicker and harder than jumping in front of a bullet train. As I entered the palace’s kitchen a man apparently thanked me for saving his son. “I’m sorry, who are you and when did I ever encounter your son or you?”. That’s what I would have asked, if even given the option, but no the game carries on giving you but two options. Either drink the stew he offers as a reward, or don’t.\nI don’t ever remember any of the mentioned events, and this could only have happened less than 20 minutes ago in the previous chapter.\n\nMore inconsistencies constantly surface, even in the final act of the game. Where you somehow have all the items you need to somehow combat your foes. Such as meeting three damsels in a castle and suddenly having wild roses, which you exclaim wards off and incapacities these vile creatures. Okay, yes. Magical flowers I somehow picked up somewhere. I don’t know where, nor did I ever do so.  There are gaps in the game, and it’s a shame. One would think that since choosing your own adventure is the core mechanic the game would be simply packed full of content and choices. Sadly it’s all rather lacking, with barely any content to sate any person’s gaming or reading appetite. It fails on both accounts.\n\nThere are different class and character attributes, strength, constitution, agility, magic, and charm. The latter being emphasised throughout the game, and always highlighted. Instantly alerting you to its significance. These ware all affected by in game choices, such as speaking with someone, or witnessing something. In the case of constitution, my character lost a point simply while having his lunch and witnessing a man being executed. This was a permanent loss of one point, rather annoying but nothing series.  As mentioned charm is highlighted, and turns out to be the most important, not for simply speaking to people you encounter, but also the final conflict with the stories antagonist. It matters little that my magic points were the same as my charm ones. I was unable to cast a single spell as a mage during this encounter, and simply overpowered and subdued the creature by appealing to their humanity. So, what’s the point in all the previous options for actions, or attributes?\nWhat little there is to Vlad the Impaler was rather enjoyable, but sadly horribly marred by the serious lack of content, and depth beyond merely having a Yes or No option.\nThe ‘game’, simply rushes you through in about an hour, and despite claiming to have replayability due to user choice changing the story; it’s simply false.\nThe beautiful and dark art, and music is fantastic and I truly enjoyed seeing and listened to it. Still, I simply cannot recommend this ‘game’ to anyone. Whether they want a dark RPG, or a visual choose your own adventure book. There simply is not enough content to justify the price tag, and makes one wonder if this was not the reason for information and details regarding the game not surfacing on its Steam page until a day or two after launch.\n\nA true waste of what could have been something dark and wonderful.","July 21, 2014","false","1.2"," 264 of 323 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","264","323","0","7"

There is no in-game manual, no forums or creator's website to check on, you will have no idea what each of the 8 stats do and how they affect the game. You will choose among the places opened to you to visit per chapter, and subsequent chapters open up more locations and these locations hold events that shape your adventure, and each time you visit a location you will get a random event from a pool created by the developers(you may get them randomly, but the events themselves are always the same), these events will usually ask you to make one of two choices, that will have the conclusion pertaining to your choice. You have to note that the characters that you picked are not you, they are your avatars with their own history, and during events I find that characters will use their hidden knowledge that players didn't even know they know or that they are qualified for, or using clues you've obtained which was never properly explained. Depending on the places you visit and the choices you make, you will be rewarded predetermined or penalize stats(in which you have no idea how the developers came to the conclusion that these are what you should profit or lose from the experience of the event). With this method, I find it defeats the purpose of making your own choices, since a player will see all the events via multiple play through(see the spoiler to why), then pick the most advantageous choices to maximize stat gain.\n\n(Spoiler) At the end of the story you fight the boss(which is the only time these stats seem to have any use), and you choose from among the ambiguously named choices on the left panel(which are actually battle events that utilizes your stats to "fight" the boss). The higher your stats are, the better the story result for that option you picked, if you win in the story event against the boss he will take a strike, with 3 strikes on the boss you win, the opposite is true if the boss wins 3 battle events. In which case kills your character, ends the game and deletes the save pertaining to that play through.\n\nIt just feels to me like this game is made to be a quick cash grab. Contrary to the bit about the developers knowing what we want as a gamer, this game is far from complete, alpha stage at best.","July 16, 2014","false","3.8"," 161 of 217 people (74%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","74","161","217","0","0"

At its most basic, it's a choose-your-own-adventure type of game, but of course, the subject matter is different from the traditional children's books. Your character is sent by his liege, the eponymous Vlad, to investigate the increase in murders and violence in Istanbul, and depending on the character you choose, you will have different means to conduct your investigation, and defend yourself when attacked. Your character has stats, and they will increase and decrease during the adventure, making him or her better at surviving in different ways.\n\nThe writing is gripping and engaging (though for some reason, the word "and" is always missing), and while a playthrough can be completed in fifteen minutes, you'll find yourself doing quite a few of them, because it's impossible to do everything in one playthrough.\n\nNegative points about the game are the fact that you don't know what outcomes your choices will have (and sometimes they'll be questionable), and that the stat increases and decreases seem to be a bit strange at times.\n\nSo if you like reading and playing a choose-you-own-story type of game, and you have a vivid imagination, you can buy this one while it's on sale. Its regular price isn't justified, not out of quality concerns, but by how short a playthrough is.","October 31, 2014","true","1.5"," 64 of 72 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","64","72","0","5"

When I first bought the thing, it didn't even work until a patch was released so we can play it. It takes about 20 minutes to beat the whole story, and the story-line structure/mechanics in the game are organized poorly (E.g., You have a stat system in-game that doesn't serve any function until the **Spoiler** Boss battle.) Although, I do admit that the art and the gui in the game is pretty neat, it still looks more worked on then the game itself. I enjoy good reads however, but with the presentation of a premade story (Which pretty much destroys the whole "Create-your-own-adventure" feel),vague character "classes" (Which serves more as a cosmetic, since Classes barely do anything except give you different starting stats and look), and the lack of effectiveness a result is from a choice made makes this game a display of wasted potential.\n\n<If I could refund this game, I wouldn't.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Skogbeorn/recommended/295850/","Skogbeorn","Skogbeorn","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Skogbeorn/","170 products in account","Let me start off by saying that this is not an RPG, like a great many of my fellow reviewers would like to think. Vlad the Impaler is an adult-oriented visual novel, and is built on storytelling and atmosphere rather than hacky-slashy action bits. You do not play by mastering game mechanics so that you can beat the final boss, but by learning how the world works and using your wit.\n\n\n\nGAMEPLAY\n\nThe gameplay consists first of fifteen days you are free to spend as you see fit within the city of Istanbul, in an attempt to reveal the source of many sinister murders within the city walls. You click where in the city you wish to travel, and what you wish to do once there. You will for the most part be reading, and appreciating the artwork of the game, and then making decisions for your character underway. These decisions will affect your stats, meaning that your character is shaped by what he does in the game. For example, if you were to gain favor with a crowd of people for winning an argument with a corrupt cleric, your influence within the city would rise, thus increasing your charm stat, allowing you to much more easily persuade people to do as you would have them. Or, were you to witness a particularily horrifying sight within the catacombs, your constitution would go down as a representation of your mental health.\n\nSome people complain about this system, because it is sometimes hard to see why a particular stat has gone up or down, and becuase you sometimes cannot influence it. But I found that stopping and thinking for a moment when in doubt as to why the game had given me the stats that it did, it made sense in the end. And though it may sometimes feel cheap to lose stats because of an event which you couldn't predict, you should be fine as long as you do not actively seek trouble. For example, delving into the catacombs alone and with no map should to most people sound of mind sound like a poor idea.\n\nSOUNDTRACK\n\nThe soundtrack in this game is amazing, and adds a lot to the game's atmosphere. However, it is on the short side, so you can expect some of it to loop after you've played the game for a while. This isn't really something you will notice unless you go out of your way to listen for it, though.\n\nGRAPHICS\n\nThe artwork is all beautifully hand-drawn, and invokes a sense of dread and despair fitting very well with the game. Though the game is largely text-based, the artwork along the text serves to increase immersion. I found myself searching up various scenes from the game after having completed it just to look at them again. Though art will always be subjective, I personally adore the style that the game went for.\n\nSTORY\n\nThe story follows the grim journey of your player character as he attempts to unravel the mystery of Istanbul. The city is descending into darkness, murders happen on a nightly basis, and several cults and creatures are starting to rise to the surface. Sent by your old friend Vlad, you will quickly find that something has gone horribly awry, and that those who preach of goodness and piety might well carry the greatest darkness of them all...\n\nThere are plenty of side-stories to follow, all of which are really well written. However, the game suffers from some disconnection as you might start a side-story and never end up finishing it, or finish a story that you did not start. There are also some grammatical errors, as the game is not made by native English-speakers. However, I find that this is not enough to break the atmosphere that the game builds, though some people may react more strongly to it.\n\n\n\nCONCLUSION:\n\nPlaying Vlad the Impaler is like reading a good horror novel. It's scarier than any game I've played before, including Outlast, Penumbra and Amnesia. Not because it's got scary monsters that pop out at you, but because it builds a sense of inescapable dread and despair, the likes of which is found in the works of Bram Stoker, H.P. Lovecraft and Edgar Allan Poe. I would hesitate to call it an artsy game, but it definetly takes inspiration from great works of literature. If you're a fan of horror, or just classic literature, play this game. It's great value for the price. However, if you're after more of an RPG or traditional visual novel, this might not be the game for you. It also does require an appreciation for good art and writing.\n\nI don't like rating games from one to ten, because it's all so very subjective, especially in this genre. I will say, however, that this is an amazing visual novel, and it's perfect for a gloomy night, alone with headphones in a dark room.","June 23, 2015","true","3.5"," 30 of 35 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","30","35","0","0"

Come on, Steam. This isn't actually a game. I played it through from start to finish in less than half an hour.\n\nWhat small amount of game there is, isn't bad. The core concept is cool, the artwork and 'main menu' event choice isn't bad. The writing isn't completely terrible, but it comes off as confused due to how limited the decisions are (and having to guess what the developers think your character should do based on a few words for each decision is annoying). The modular format ultimately leads to the feeling that your character doesn't matter whatsoever, and you're just navigating through a bunch of randomized binary events which don't have any cohesion.\n\nNot only that, but if I can play it from start to finish in half an hour and the only replayability draw is a 'gotta see 'em all' approach to the random events (which really don't have much relevance, except for the psuedo-combat event at the end), you can't really call this a game. At least the Hero Project (which is a CYOA in the same vein) had a large amount of content and was worth a couple hours of gameplay per chapter. While I wasn't overly fond of Hero Project's writing and design, it had enough content that I'm comfortable calling it a game. This isn't a game.\n\nBefore it can be called a game, Vlad would benefit from a couple really basic design decisions like a 'choose your own backstory' that personalized your character and a plot that has a logical progression from one event to the next, instead of a bunch of snap shots cobbled together (and only 15 total, at that) which affect your stats in unpredictable ways and have no ultimate point (as your stats only affect one outcome, the finale).\n\nPretty disappointed that Steam was willing to put this up for sale as a complete game.","July 18, 2014","false","0.5"," 81 of 122 people (66%) found this review helpful","66","81","122","0","3"

It has many good aspects, but too many bad.\n\nThe art is nice, but it's composed entirely of still scenes made to appear to move by camera pans. The selection of a player type (basically explorer, warrior, mage) seems to offer promise. But it quickly reveals itself as only offering the illusion of a non-linear game. You are given options as to what part of the city you wish to visit, and a menu selection of options once you arrive there. But the options come from nowhere, with no background. ("Find the soldier's head." WHAT soldier? "Buy a falafel." Same menu, honest to God.) And no matter which you choose, you will end up with the only one that actually furthers the story.\n\nThe eventual result of your "choice" will be the increase or decrease of certain character attributes. This is where 'Vlad the Impaler" REALLY gets squirrelly. For example, breaking into the dock master’s office and finding 6 brutally murdered bodies increases "charm". Carrying a dying girl to the doctor decreases your "intelligence", with no explanation. (NEVER with an explanation.) Making a deadly enemy by humiliating a street preacher increases "charm". Maybe it's cultural.\n\nSpeaking of "cultural", many of the deficiencies are made up for by the humor created by language barriers. Several example of which:\n"It seems to elude that there was a secret temple to Medusa..."\n"Keeping the jagged knife just beyond the slice of your flesh..."\n"You hurl your torch at the thing that's grabbed hold of her are suddenly struck with terror..."\nAND my personal favorite;\n"The Order of the Dragon Hmmm"\n\nShould I ever change my Steam ID, it will be to "The Order of the Dragon Hmmm".\n\nNot the worst game ever.

But I don't care that it was short, it was so cool to play. I Definitely recommend it. I loved the writing some of the stuff that happened in the story was really interesting and exciting. I really liked the presentation, so many beautiful sketches, great music along with the narrative created a really awesome atmosphere.\n\n(optional let's play footage)\nUnfortunately for some reason steam does not like the URL for part 1. But if you are really keen to see some gameplay footage of this game find it in my Youtube channel here instead.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBBH5tCnDps\nHow would you describe this game? The best way I can think of to classify is as an illustrated choose your adventure novel with RPG elements. It's a has very dark, ominous, macabre atmosphere. Each part is backed by hand drawn greyscale scenes illustrating events which are described in text. You have the city screen where you choose where to go and investigate next. You are only able to visit 1 to 2 place each turn. You are not able to keep tabs on the entire city everyday because there will be anywhere from 5 or more locations to choose from. Within each scene you will be presented with two choices and have to make on of them. For example whether or not to carry a weak woman off a boat, I chose to help. But it turned out that she was a vampire and the reason she needed assitance was because she was unable to cross moving water. You actions have consequences. Usually choices result in the increase or decrease of your stats such as strength and magic or a change in your reputation. So, yeah basically the game boils down to choosing which places to visit each day and which choices to make in each place. That's how you interact with the story.\n\nThere is basically no animation and virtually no colour in this game. But I really liked the literally very black artwork. I liked the omninous, atmospheric music. I really liked the written narrative and the setting. For example it was cool to be able descend into catacombs and be confronted by some pretty ghoulish characters. Some of scenes are pretty gruesome, terribly mutilated bodies strewn around the city's streets and some brutally violent events. For example my poor guide through the catacombs basically had a chunk of her skull ripped out by the jaws of a ghoul. Even I gasped a little when I came to some parts. The game has a very strong horror theme!\n\nSo, so far I'm really impressed by this game (doesn't that make me sound horrible straight the previous paragraph lol). Okay so I haven't put replayability or variety of twists and turns of the story or it's outcomes to the test yet. But I sort of got the feeling that with only being able to choose 1 to 2 out of 5 or so locations per turn and different choices made at each place that the game has potential for different experiences for each player and playthrough. In addition there are two other character classes you can choose from that I haven't looked at yet which should affect things further. Also I got up turn 10 of 15 turns in only around 30 minutes. So if the ends at turn 15 then it's a pretty short game. But to be honest as long as I enjoy the rest of the game I would consider it is short and sweet and that would enough to satisfy me.\n\nAs much as I loved this I have to admit for such a short game it may be a bit expensive for those who wish to get the most gaming time for their hard earned cash. Also I have to let you guys that the game seemed to bug out slightly at the end for me, in place of like the last paragraph of the story there was a wierd message with underscores through it. Also I've looked at one of the other reviews here and apparently at end of the some of the images didn't render properly and they could only see a big blue mass or something. But hopefully more people don't have these problems.\n\nIf you like this game, click here for my review and let's play videos of Soul Gambler. It's similar sort of game, which I really liked although it is pretty short.\n\nClick here for more let’s play videos =)","July 16, 2014","true","3.3"," 58 of 94 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","58","94","0","7"

In the key events your success is based on stats, so careful character development (giving the light RPG feel) and discovering the outcomes of the individual choices is a crucial part of the gameplay.

Oh yeah, it's definitely a short game that can be played through in roughly 30-60 minutes, but choosing where to go and what to do next is fun, even if you pretty much already know what's going to happen in the end. It feels like a visual novel with some small RPG elements, which is a nice mixture. Well, for me, at least. I played through the game with a mage but I'm replaying it again soon with a different character to see if anything changes in the way the story is told. In any case, it seems very likely.\n\nThe music is the least thing I liked about it, because there's very little variation and it seems to repeat quite a lot.\n\nAnd visually this game isn't a stunner; the artwork is mostly static with a few small animations here and there. It's nicely done anyway, and has a certain gothic feel to it that absolutely fits the game and story.\n\nYup, it's still a pricey game, so better wait for a sale if you're not entirely sure about it.

And believe me when I say this is not a game "for everyone".  If you're only into action-packed games which show off your "mad skillz" at mashing buttons...definitely not for you.  If you're the kind of person who complains about game length, and associated "value for money"...also definitely not for you (unless on sale for, say, a good 80% or 90% off).  And if you're the kind of person who finds themselves frequently questioning whether a game even IS "a game"...yeah, you may wanna avoid this one like the plague.  Vlad the Impaler requires an open mind and a perhaps vested interest in the "experimental" possibilities of contemporary video gaming to even HUMOUR buying it.  So I suspect that's 95% of you counted out already, and probably fair enough.\n\nSo what does one actually DO in Vlad the Impaler?  I'll try to explain.  Um...it's mostly a text-based adventure game where, at least until the final confrontation with good ol' Drac himself, you only ever get TWO choices to make per scenario you encounter; the end result of which is more text (some of which is actually very interesting and imaginative...and definitely not for the squeamish) and in all probability some minor adjustment to your Stats, which only have any bearing (as far as I can deduce) on the final confrontation.  The scenarios themselves are instigated by choosing one of a very limited number of locations in the city of Istanbul, and after fifteen such stand-alone encounters, or "turns" (which gradually unveil an overall plot of sorts...kinda...sorta...up to a point), events shift up to Castle Dracula, which seems to only consist of only a few areas - which play out exactly the same every time - before you enter the throne room of Vlad himself, where you make one of a handful of decisions as to how to handle him, and sit back and read the results.  Oddly enough, I managed to defeat him twice by choosing to "Charm" him (don't ask me...in real life, I have only marginally more charm than the dude from Zero Charisma, so I'll be ♥♥♥♥ed if I know how this ♥♥♥♥ works).  And that's about it really, and I managed to play it through three times in 90 minutes, apparently...though certain encounters being randomly (?) repeated on subsequent plays did help me to speed through it all the quicker on successive play-throughs (so maybe an hour per game, at best).  And there's only three character classes, and having played them all I can't honestly say that there seems to be a HUGE amount of difference between how they affect the game...\n\nSo why in Beelzebub's good name would I be RECOMMENDING this, you ask?  Well, firstly because Steam reviews don't allow me to hit a button precisely half-way between a yay or a nay, so given that this is essentially a "quality" product in as much as what it aims to achieve, my conscience dictates that I must vote in the positive.  Some of the writing is actually very nice, the hand-drawn artwork and music are both quite exquisite and suitably atmospheric, and some of the events are impressively gruesome (not visually, just in concept...mayhem involving children seeming a particularly recurring theme for some odd reason, so if that kind of thing easily offends you, there's yet another reason to steer clear of this product).  Honestly, if it was free or had a preposterously low RRP (say, two or three dollars at most), I'd be singing its praises at least slightly louder...but $9.99 is taking the ♥♥♥♥ just a little, I gotta say.  Wait for a really, really good sale price, or just avoid completely if it doesn't "sound like you".  Me, I'm the curious type, so I don't tend to get too bitter about these things.  It is what it is.  And what it is ain't all that much, when all is said and done.  A free copy of the soundtrack would certainly add a tiny bit more value to something which I can't otherwise see anyone getting more than a few hours' worth of entertainment out of, even with replays.  The decision is yours, on your head be it...\n\nVerdict: 5.5/10 (and even then, only on sale).","July 29, 2014","true","1.3"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

However it does suffer from a few drawbacks, the main one being that the developers have tried encouraging players to replay the game dozens of times with the choice of multiple classes, outcomes and weapon choices. The problem with this is that the game lacks variety, mainly with not offering enough different scenarios to keep each play through unique. After the third or fourth time you've easily done every possible scenario at least once with very little varied difference.  Even if there was the same amount of scenarios but more than one piece of art and choice was given each time I think the game would have defiantly benefited.\n\nAnother drawback is that the game contains quite a few spelling and grammar errors that were never fixed. Makes me wonder how the game wasn’t proof-read?  I can only assume the game wasn’t originally English. While this isn’t a huge deal it is distracting and completely breaks the immersion of the story. Finally the game has an issue where it displays a black screen upon launch, this is fixed by verifying the game cache but is pretty irritating and really should have been fixed by now.\n\nFor its current price of $0.99 I would defiantly recommend still giving this game a chance, while it’s far from perfect and disappointingly shallow, it’s still worth the price and sinking a few hours into.\n","February 1","true","16.2"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

The decreases are incredibly obnoxious, especially if your choices are being influenced by whether you need to aim for a high or low morality.\n\nMost disappointingly there is something a class system which unfortunately seems to only influence your initial attribute scores: there is no change in dialogue or choices for each class which severely hampers potential replayability.

There are 3 classes to choose from which are explorer, warrior, and mage.  There is a karma level which will change your main class into one of two subclasses.   For example, if you are a warrior and did mainly good karma choices in the game, you will become a paladin.   On the other hand, if chose mainly evil karma choices,  you will become an assassin.   The impact on the game becoming one of two subclasses seem to be none.  The choices, good to evil or neutral, seem to have their own unique rewards/penalties which will add, for example, stat to your strength.  There are 6 chapters with 3 "missions" (each where you will make a choice) per chapter.  In the very end,  finally,  you get to make choices on how to fight Vlad the Impaler.  Seemingly the only combat you will do in this text-based RPG game.\n\nAt first walkthrough, it was very interesting experience but on the second and third walkthroughs,  I was going through exact same missions (You can't pick all the same missions due to limit of missions per chapter but nevertheless, the missions do not change) and thus I found a significant hinderance to replayability value of the game.  For anyone who are looking into this game, you are likely to lose all the value in playing after 4th or 5th walkthrough.  As I have started skipping dialogues because I have already done the missions, some more than twice, before.\n\nDue to lack of replayability value,  I am not recommending this game.   If this game is heavily discounted and you are looking for a few hours of valuable experience, then this game becomes barely recommendable.   Expect more than few hours of valueable experience, just walk away from this game.","November 21, 2014","false","31.4"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","8","12","0","0"

Except for some fights, (i.e. against Vlad) you can make some choice on where to hit him or what to do in the fight. There isn't any 3D movement, it's laid out in a page format kind of like a book, and you can choose where to go in parts of the city to find tips or clues on the storyline. You may also have characters you meet such as old ladies in graveyards, and you have no idea what they might do, so choose your decision wisely, leave her alone or see what she's up to! It has a branching storyline so it can affect yoru outcome in many ways. It's worth the ten bucks i bought it for, but barely. I probably won't get more than ten ganeplays in before it bores me. But I definitely recommend it to anyone!","July 19, 2014","true","1.2"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","0"

You are presented with places to "search" (or go, fight, investigate, etc)  where you're given one or more options.  Your choice determines the derived experience -- meaning what you learn about the state of the city (corruption, undercurrents, what evil abounds), or you just get your ♥♥♥ kicked along the way.  Unfortunately, it's not airtight.\n\nKey Plus factors:\n+ Outstanding writing.  Best aspect of the game. Potentially overwhelming with the amount of information you gather, the descriptions and language read well.\n+ Understated graphics. Black/white impressionistic at start/finish of chapters.\n+ The atmospheric and authentic element is successful.\n\nKey Minus factors:\n-- Extensive discontinuity.   Conceptually, consider multiple doors that lead to different rooms along different paths.  Great theory, especially for replayability, right?  BUT  ...You may go from point A to C without the critical knowledge one gets at B.  (or you're later rewarded/penalized for a decision you never made).  This is especially true for the subtle cluegathering as you solve the mystery, but such a game would be way to ambitious from a small studio.\n-- That said, replayability is compromised because you can only make an either/or decision two ways.\n-- Your attributes are raised/lowered based on your choices.  Unclear how attributes even make a difference.  A manual would be really helpful here.  Sometimes impacts are unpredictable.  Sometimes, you may need to compromise attributes to gain information.  What's "charm" anyway?\n-- Enjoyable music, but after a couple of hours, it might grow tiresome.\n\nNeutral:\n-- Permadeath.  Dying in later chapters means you completely start over.  Do not pass go, do not collect $200.\n\nClean up the discontinuity and you'd have a nice $15 game.  For now, consider it bundle padding.","October 3, 2014","true","51.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

I am expecting all these in an rpg graphic novel. Given very little control over the battle mechanics, I find it more constrained when the characters I choose have skills that I didn't know of, and activated in story options that I have no clue of.\n\nWhile some choices unlocked other beneficial options (eg killing the kidnapper allows the father of the rescued boy to give you some stats boosting potion, and grant access to the sultan's kitchen for more stats boosting concoction), the whole game didn't appear clear to me.

No manual, no form of a tutorial, no helpful information. Especially for those who have no knowledge or of lack the history of Vlad the Impaler, this game will be confusing. There is a lot of reading/information in text form (this is where at least some voice over would have been divine) and a lot to process. Yet it feels even with all this information being given to you, you don't really know what is happening. In multiple cases the dialog ran along the lines of 'It had been 3 days since...' yet I had only just arrived in the city and there is a counter in the middle of the screen of how many days you have been in game. Rather confusing.\n\nThere are a number of ways to complete the game but all end with the almost the exact same result.

It seemed like perfection in theory: you make decisions, you can be good or evil, Vlad, nice graphics, you can be a mage/rogue/soldier (cookies for the devs that the female character is the soldier not the mage and there is functional armor), you are a badass, vampire and monster lore, what else could a girl want?\nThere are some interesting quests, some horrifying, some witty and sassy lines, some awesome art and some of the endings I saw so far were pretty surprising, but sadly none of these can balance that this game is seriously repetitive and irritating the more you play it.\n\nIt can be maddeningly unhelpful and buggy. I played through several times already, yet I still don't understand how certain quests activate or what stat is required for what. You can ask about something on Steam community (as this is about the only place where someone actually answers), but you will probably only get a "find out for yourself" answer from others, so you have to try making other decisions and decision combinations which certainly will try your patience when the number of your playthroughs is in the double digits.\n\nYou only get 2 options every decision: most of the time one of them gives good karma, the other evil karma. Your karma decides what specialization you get around Chapter 3.\nYou can die between the chapters, if your 'relevant' stat(s) aren't high enough (and sometimes the stat you need isn't the one you think it is), so you don't really have too much choice over your build. Fortunately or unfortunately it doesn't matter much what specialization you got, because everything is pretty uniform in the end.\n\nThere are 3+6 achievements which are the most aggravating thing in this game. You have to choose the eight weapons of every class (meaning: 3*(3 light weapons+3 dark weapons+1 light legendary+1 dark legendary)). Add to this that the legendary weapons sometimes won't spawn even if your 'relevant' stat is in the 20s range.\nSo yeah. That probably means around 24 or more playthroughs, if you don't forget to write down what weapon you already chose and you are lucky enough to have the 3*2 legendary weapons to spawn.\n\nAnd let's not talk about the last fight, because that can be one of the most colossal ♥♥♥♥ups in the history of gaming and you pretty much only have a chance to win  without charming (which has its own stat too)  if you either had high enough stats or you got the specialized legendary weapon (which only happens if you had high enough stats at the end of Chapter 5). But sometimes the whole sequence gets buggy and you can't go back or forward so you are stuck and you have to start the whole game again, because the save feature is just... I don't know? Let's go with totally useless and let's say that it has room for improvement (but it won't probably get improved because I'm pretty sure that it was intended to be like this, so you are 'encouraged' to play the game over and over again).\n\nSo you can roleplay and die a lot, but if you actually want to win sometime then you are practically back to only doing those quests which give you the needed stats AND good or evil karma. You actually don't have much freedom while playing.\n\nAll in all:\nI will collect all of the achievements in the end, but after that I'll never replay this game and it'll probably gather dust in my Library, because I certainly don't want a nervous breakdown over any of this ♥♥♥♥.","November 3, 2014","false","4.7"," 10 of 18 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","10","18","0","0"

However, the art style and music are very nice, in my opinion. I enjoy the black and white art. Sadly, after a couple playthroughs it gets quite dull due to the repetition.

Each playthrough offers a different experience and immersive story totalling two hours of content."\n\nThis is entirely true. The story that the novel tells is quite short: In 80 minutes I have been able to make one playthrough each with the three classes available and there's still room for more runs.\n\nThe game offers little in the way of instructions and throws you to the hub-screen immediately. The story progresses by selecting one of the locations (starting with Port, Square, and Bazaar, with Catacombs and Basilica added in a later chapter, and Palace last of all) and then deciding how to proceed in the provided scenario. Your choices alter your stats and might have some influence on later scenarios. After finishing three scenarios the story advances to the next chapter, with the climax after the 15th scenario. The stats aren't used until the very end of the climax when you encounter the Great Evil.\n\nAll in all I found the game and its story to be interesting. Even though its fairly short I find the possibilties for several playthroughs to make it worthy of the 9.99 euro pricetag.","July 23, 2014","true","1.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The gameplay is confusing as to what each stat does, and it seems that it doesnt except for the end game.\nThe story, writing and artwork is superb. But that too is confusing - how does the character discover the things in the chapter transition story? And one annoying thing is that the events are disconnected from each other.\nFor example at one event I was thanked for a thing I had not done and I was a bit confused, and on the next playthrough the event I was thanked for actually happened. Very immersion breaking.\nAfter one play-through, had to go back and check if this game is early-access. It is not.\n\nAll in all I really like this game even with its many flaws. But for 10€ in its current state I am not sure if it is entirely worth it. I hope more content will be added and the events changed to feel more connected.

Not even good socks, but mismatched ones with holes in the toes.\n\nWrapping paper: The art, GUI and music are all utterly gorgeous. Holey socks: The game mechanics and story are a complete wreck.\n\nVlad the Impaler takes place over the course of fifteen turns, broken up over six chapters. Each turn allows you to take a single action, which gives you a little snippet of story and presents a moral dilemma, and your decision affects your stats. For example: you can go "Buy a Falafal" where you run into a fugitive, then choose to help or condemn him, which results in a plus or minus to certain character attributes. After three of these events, the chapter ends, and you get new information about the plot.\n\nThe trouble is, there is no guarantee that the three actions you take will be related, and there is no indication anywhere which ones are most important to the main plot. Some events seem totally random, and the story appears to be unaffected by your choices to the point that it moves on without you. Because you can only take three actions in each act, and thus only get three little vignettes of plot that may or may not be directly related to each other, you will never have all the information necessary to make real sense of the events that come later, unless you play through the game several times to read everything, which is an extremely ♥♥♥♥♥♥ way to tell a story. Entire chunks of plot just end up missing; and when each chapter ends, characters you've never met before may pop up and allude to events that haven't happened because you didn't play through them.\n\nIn most visual novels or other games with choice based gameplay, events you play through are flagged by the system and ONLY storylines pertaining to the actions you've actually taken play out. That's not the case here, and it makes for a frustrating experience.\n\nThere's also the fact that, while choice is a selling point in games of this type, there is a lot of God Modding in this one that make your choices seem arbitrary and worthless. Free will is mostly an illusion in Vlad the Impaler, and the plot moves you where it wants you to go without your say so. Suppose you choose to follow a mysterious woman who catches your eye and end up back at her home; when she tries to seduce you, you kill her and slice her head clean off--and the only part of this that was your choice was following her. You aren't given the option to coax information out of her before beheading her, or let her carry on with her seduction, or anything else, because God Modding is in play: you WILL do what the plot decrees whether you like it or not.\n\nIt doesn't help that the prose leaves a lot to be desired. It's sufficiently atmospheric, but the grammar is terrible, a lot of punctuation and whole words are missing and many of the events are cliche. I might be more forgiving to those if the rest of the game's problems were less annoying, but as it is they're just salt in the wound.\n\nIf the devs ever do an update that allows for more events or choices each turn or at least fixes some of the grammar and punctuation issues, I would reccommend this in a heartbeat. (With the usual provisos about its content--it's violent, and falls into many of the usual tropes that are pretty boring at this point.)\n\nAs it is, I'm going to have to say: give it a pass unless you can get it for at least 50% off.","June 28, 2015","false","16.4"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ArtixSA/recommended/295850/","ArtixSA","Artix","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ArtixSA/","287 products in account","I can, at best, say that I enjoy this game in an ironic way. It's a CYOA with some light RPG elements (though good luck ever figuring that out from the available screenshots and videos) but that would be giving it more credit than it arguably deserves. You have a choice of three main characters to start with, but the only differences between them are a slight difference in starting stats. Once you're in the game proper, it's divided into five "Chapters" of three days each, and on each day you can go to one of six or so places and see an event (it was originally random which event you got, but has since been patched to allow you to choose). Each event has two different outcomes - sometimes you get nothing for your trouble, sometimes you learn information or get an item, and regardless of your choice you usually get a small stat boost/penalty.\n\nOstensibly, this is meant to be a setup where you can learn different information and do different actions along the way to make each playthrough unique, but the plot doesn't follow through with that at all. At the beginning and end of each chapter, you will always be in the correct spot for the game to continue, regardless of what you actually did over those three days. In fact, the only difference between playthroughs (aside from the events themselves) is your stat spread, and which options that opens and closes to you. There are more stat checks now than there were at launch, but the number of times that your strength or magic score actually matters can still be counted on both hands if we're being generous. There is also a morality system, though as far as I can tell the only thing it does is determine which of the two "promoted" classes you become.\n\nForgetting the game and its structure for now, the actual writing is laughably bad. The developers were going for "dark" (which is in-and-of-itself not a bad thing, considering the subject matter), but went straight past it into grimdark-trying-too-hard territory. I mean, for god's sake just read the "About the Game" section of the store page to see what I mean. To the game's credit, there are a couple points where it all comes together and actually works, but those moments are few and far between (and mostly in the second "half" of the game). For the most part, the writing is dull and grimdark for the sake of being edgy.\n\nThe one thing I will say that I like about the game is the decision to go with the all-greyscale artwork. There are times when it makes it kind of difficult to tell exactly what's going on, but on the whole it works. The music is entirely forgettable, all five or so tracks of it.","October 21, 2014","false","3.0"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

You read text, you make choices, those choices affect your stats. The art reminds me of Gustave Dore's art for Paradise Lost (which is actually kind of fitting given the subject matter) and is mostly black and white with a bit of brown thrown in. You can choose one of three characters. Your choice doesn't really impact the game that much, although they appear to get different events. There's some great writing and atmosphere in this game, from cannibal priests to ritual murders to attending swanky parties at the Sultan's Palace, you'll find all that here and more.\n\nThe game reminds me very much of the Yawhg (also a text-based horror game( but unlike the Yawgh, it seems to lack any random elements. Events seem to play out the same way for each character regardless of stats, your stats only really seem to have an effect during the final battle and that.....is very disappointing..... it's also really short, my first playthrough maybe took me twenty minutes because I was carefully reading everything, subsequent playthroughs took about five minutes.\n\nDespite being disappointing in a number of ways, I'm giving it a tentative recommendation because I love text-based games like this one, and if you liked The Yawhg you should definitely check this one out. If the game were a bit more random I'd certainly recommend it, but as it is now, I like it, I think it definitely has potential, but the execution is....not as great as I'd hoped.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/taylort210/recommended/295850/","taylort210","Wagglesworth","http://steamcommunity.com/id/taylort210/","3054 products in account","Vlad is an interesting beast, though not nearly for the best reasons. Having the benefit of knowing exactly what this game was, prior to the eventual retooling of its originally more misleading store page description, I was not taken aback by what it proved to be: a choose-your-own-adventure literary experience, and little else. But oddly enough, despite some decently written miniature tales and absolutely superb artistic direction, it’s soon evident that the writers behind Vlad had absolutely no idea how to connect the individual pieces into a single, coherent storyline, and it leads to an utter mess of a tale.\n\nDespite previously calling it so, Vlad should barely even be considered a CYOA. Calling it as such would imply that that there is some reasoning behind your decisions and actions, and that the overall narrative follows a distinct path of your choosing. Rather, you’re given a series of locations in which you can randomly choose to visit. Choose, and you’re given a several paragraph snippet of some unique occurrence, where you’ll be given a single option that will usually reward or detract skill points from any number of your available stats. These events have no relevance to overall narrative, and serve only to manipulate your stats, which themselves are completely irrelevant until the very end. The actual narrative is only touched on at specific points after a certain number of “turns” have passed. Only, these points, while not necessarily “jumping around”, speak of events that never happened, of people and groups that you, the player, likely never have heard of prior, and attempts to piece together a story using only the beginning, several middle points, and end, without ever offering what happens in between.\n\nIt’s evident from the store page and individual stories present in the game that there are some very talented writers behind Vlad, the problem is that there’s never any attempt to combine the different pieces into a single, or several, branching narratives, like a real CYOA. In retrospect, it’s really no different than Telltale’s more popular efforts, like Walking Dead and Wolf Among Us, but unlike in those, Vlad’s narrative never truly becomes coherent, nor even attempts to hide the fact that your “choices” amount to nothing more than a statistic. More so, the “game” lasts no more than a half hour, provided you calmly read through each piece. The gall of such developers to try and charge $10 for this is laughable and naïve on their part, assuming they believed that word wouldn’t quickly get around to avoid like the plague. But even so, while I would certainly call Vlad’s narrative broken, I wouldn’t designate the entire experience as a wholly negative one. The art is absolutely fantastic, and is the highest contributor to Vlad’s quality, and the individual stories, short as they are, are a joy to read. While the overall narrative is poorly meshed together, the “lite” RPG elements barely tacked on, and the asking price positively ridiculous, despite my negative grade, I would recommend that once this is bundled, to give it a run through, or even several. There are more unique events than you can visit in a single playthough, and they are fun, very short reads. As a CYOA, this “game” is a veritable failure, but as a brief and unique diversion from the more common experiences on steam, Vlad can entertain for the very short while it lasts.","August 8, 2014","false","2.7"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

I don't know why, but after spending a while thinking about it, having an achievement for it makes me want my money back.\n\nI wouldn't recommend this game to anyone I'm friends with, and I wouldn't want to be friends with anyone who would be my friend if I recommended it.","August 4, 2014","false","1.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I've played this game through several times and noticed that a Lot of times the word "and" is missing. I mean, as far as I can tell that's the only problem. Every Time there should be an and connecting two parts of a sentence it's just not there and it's confusing unless you realize that.\n\nExample from not the game: "His knees were weak his arms were heavy." instead of "His knees were weak and his arms were heavy."\n\nBesides that though everything is fine I guess the game just seems off. The game gives you 15 days to make choices and boost your stats with interludes between every three days. I have Never been able to get past a certain point after the 15 days are up because my stats just aren't right I guess and I've even died during the interludes because my stats aren't right. If anything the game just needs a good polish and I have a really good feeling that's never gonna happen. The game's been out since July of 2014. If this game was going to be polished and made better it would of happened by now.\n\nI mean you can buy this game if you want it's okay, but it could be way better. It's only five bucks so hey whatever. The only reason you'd want this game besides if you're into these kind of games is if you want to play it with a group of people.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Maxmetpt/recommended/295850/","Maxmetpt","Maxmetpt","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Maxmetpt/","704 products in account","Vlad the Impaler is a text-based game with some RPG elements, set in 15th century Istanbul (or Constantinople/Byzantium).\nYou're sent to the city by none other than Vlad III (the Impaler), to investigate and annihilate the darkness involving it.\n\nDo NOT expect an historically accurate narrative. It deals a lot with religious and supernatural themes (not in a very serious manner, but more to set the tone), and it represents Vlad more as the Dracula we're familiar with than the historical character.\nSome of the events may resemble actual history/culture, but use it as a stepping stone to investigate yourself and nothing else.\nI'm mentioning this because of some Community Hub discussions that arose from this confusion. These discussions are great, with people researching for something and exchanging ideas, but please, don't take it completely out of context!\n\nA good comparation for this game would be, I believe, The Yawhg. It's not quite the same, but close enough to be mentioned.\nEven less, is FTL or Weird Worlds (some aspects).\nAll of these are designed to be highly replayable, with several branching paths (mini-archs) and some overall goal and story that you learn about as you play more and more.\nThe 2 latter games have far deeper mechanics, while this is almost exclusively text-based (each encounter has a binary choice), with different stats that will define your fate against the final "Boss".\n\nI have enjoyed the game during my 2 first playthroughs, and I was initially going to give it a recommendation... However, the more I played, the more problems I've found with it, and how flawed the game design actually is. In these 4 hours I've done 5 or 6 runs through the game.\nTake into account that the first was significantly lengthier, since I was reading every piece of text carefuly. The more I played, the more repetition there was, and shorter the runs got.\nIt's not a long game, by any stretch, but you can experiment more than it seems at first.\n\nHere are my in-depth thoughts.\n\nStarting with presentation, its visual style has probably grabbed your attention.\nIf you know what you're getting into, it's very, very good. Expect still images, mostly textural, to give some more atmosphere to the writing.\nIt achieves that purpose with ease! Everything is in grayscale and seems to have been hand-drawn (with a lot of texture added), and it really sets the oppressive and gothic tone of this game.\nI have no complaints here, I really enjoyed just looking at some of the scenes.\n\nThe music was both great, and very limited, to be honest. Sound design was almost inexistent. There's one song (maybe 2) in the whole game. And while those songs do add to the mood, they're also very short, and often lead to silence for a few seconds, when you take longer to read. It was very atmospheric, sticking to the background.\nA cool thing that could have been done was similar to the Bit Trip series, or even FTL, and it could be done with a single theme as well. Just make several layers or it. Using the same structure and melody, you can use several different instruments, with different intensities, etc., and switch them up to fit a particular scene. (In FTL, for example, the battle theme was the same as the travelling one, but with added percussion, and more aggressive in general) This is great for immersion and atmosphere, since it doesn't break the flow by switching songs, but it can also affect the atmosphere.\nThis is would have just been a nice addition, nothing worry-some!\n\n\nNow, onto the game itself!\nIt has a very simple structure. You have 15 turns to explore the city of Istanbul. After those 15 turns, you'll go back to Vlad's castle. Each place you explore (event) takes one turn. The game is divided into 6 chapters. 5 of them in the city, and then the final one.\nWhen you first begin, you can only explore 3 places in the city, with another 3 added in later chapters.\n\nAnd that's basically it. You have 3 classes (each with different focal stats), with some events playing out different depending on it. The first 5 chapters, mechanically, are for you to increase the right stats as a result of your choices in those events. Some will go well, some will not. In the last chapter, your performance will highly depend on those.\nOne problem that comes with it, is that those events are more or less random (each area has different events, more likely to occur in different times of the game/turns). This makes it very hard to control how it will all turn out in the end, being almost a dice-roll, unfortunately. After several playthroughs, you'll get an idea of which choices are more favorable, but at the same time, it's not very fun at that point, as you can imagine. And the events may also be the ones you didn't want.\n\nThis may not have hurt the game very much, seeing that defeating the Boss is not the focus, but the journey there, and exploring the city's mysteries.\nHowever, there narrative design is probably the biggest issue here. You see, while there is an overarching story (with exposition at the end of each chapter) the actual "meat" of the game, in my eyes, is the other chained events that happen. Some of the events are self contained, but other are supposedly part of a chain. Maybe you find a clue early on, and you'll follow it later... This could lead to some really interesting paths. You wouldn't choose the place to go randomly, but in reaction to what you found out previously. Unfortunately, your actions have absolutely 0 impact, and makes for a very confusing world, since you'll find out what happened at the wrong points... There's no need to actually encounter the first event of a chain to encounter the last. And encountering the first does not help you to get to the others either. Which means that I've "followed" the events in different playthroughs. Maybe I'd find the 3rd on my first run, and on my second run I'd find the 2nd event, etc... Its design is all screwed up, from this perspective. There's no cause and effect. And once you realize what's going on, the game loses a lot of its appeal and becomes a confusing mess.\n\nNow that I've explained the problem, here's a possible cause/solution. Each chapter has only 3 turns. That's very short for the player to leave an impact with each one. So, by making these longer, you could give the player a chance to follow and finish these chains, while having other random encounters as well. As it stands, there's just no room for everything, and it's not good at all. It just feels... incohesive? The exposition happens as if you were following a lead for a while, when you're actually encountering the situation for the first time. It's like reading a book while choosing chapters randomly, over the course of multiple playthroughs.\n\nThis is why I was going to recommend the game. In the first playthrough, I didn't understand everything, but I didn't see anything too wrong. The problems come when you're actually unveiling the mystery; you then see how flawed that is.\n\n\nThat's basically all that I have to say about Vlad the Impaler. Amazing art direction, for sure, and I really like the concept of the game. The mechanics, however, were not designed very correctly, from both a gameplay and narrative standpoint. I haven't played The Yawhg before, but it seems a better take on the concept, overall. Also, FTL and Weird Worlds are two games that use similar concepts, so you might want to try those before Vlad.\nHere's hoping that the developers manage to solve all of these problems, learning from mistakes and eventually focus all the talent into a much better experience!","September 20, 2014","false","4.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

A lot of people complain about the randomness of the game, but I truly believe there is a lot of depth that escapes some folks in their search for instant gratification and fairness. Indeed, this game is unfair and imbalanced and volatile. Those things only add to its charm, for me at least. Life isn't as cut and dry as many video games attempt to label it within their isolated universes. In Vlad the Impaler you have your standard RPG stats, but those stats influence events so deeply in the background that when they affect the outcome of an encounter they do so quite enigmatically. This allowed me to focus more on the events and the atmosphere of the game, but apparently many people found it jarring. Rather than speaking to the "randomness" of the game, I would say the numbers that drive the encounters to their unpredictable conclusions are simply obscured, leaving the player isolated from the usual control they have in many games. The player is simply forced to rely on their wits and to be guided by their moral compass. 9/10. Excellent music, graphics, and story elements. Takes me back to the choose-your-own adventure books of my middle school youth in the 90s. Only the grammatical errors and clear mathematical miscalculations make this game not earn a 10/10. For me, it was pretty easy to let even these rampant minor annoyances slide and be immersed in the incredible atmosphere this game generates.

Whether you get these stats or not is determined by your choice of action, and these may not always fit the character you originally chose.\n\nWhen this happens, the game may become a bit repetitive as there is no way to recover a past save for the line you were playing. You have to start from zero, and you may be reading the same options over and over. The options do not change  depending on your choice of character either.\n\nBut the story is very interesting and the artwork is very fitting, reminding of Gustav Doré´s engravings.

And strongly recomend it. You should take it genre in consideration though, because it is a text-based game. As such, there isn't much "gameplay" or game-mechanics and it's quite random and you might spend a lot of time, getting the end you want. The game itself is interesting, nonetheles, if you are into mediaval age and mystic stuff, like vampires and undead.\n\nOn the bright side, there is interesting story, which does not easily repeat itself over and over, atmospheric music and art. Also, its replayability is quite high and since average playthrough time is rather short, you can spend all evening playing.\n\nOn the other hand, though, it is quite random and you might spend a little too much time getting the ending you'd want.\n\nAs far as text-based game go - I'd prefer this game over a dozen of others...","January 26, 2015","true","4.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Its the fact that you make one wrong move and ALL your progress is erased and the game makes you start from the very beginning. I find this very unfair, why would you put save games on the main menu only for the saves not to matter at all?. Most of the time it takes more than one try to get anywhere, it took me five characters to even get past the first part no matter what Stats i had, And finally when i got to the last boss i was killed very quickly.\n\nI would reccomend this game for the beautiful artwork, lovely narration, personalities, and great music, But at the same time not reccomend it because of its unfair erasing of your saves and how hard the game is to get used to or even get far in the choose your own adventure.\n\nThis review will change if the saving thing either gets changed or an ability to save before a choice is added.","February 25, 2015","false","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

With two choices in each encounter and a lot of different encounters, it fails to bore you. How you get stat modifications through the choices you make is something new to me that I enjoyed a lot.

The typographical errors I found easy enough to gloss over--though that is not to say their existence should not be criticized--, the barebone numbers of choices makes for little replayability, and there is definitely some inconsistencies in the story that I encountered which makes it feel very amateurish.\n\nI don't know if this is their first attempt at a game or what, but if it is a first try, I think it's actually a damn good one. Certainly worth a dollar, if you know ahead of time that it's scuffed up. The visuals are amazing, the music is simple but serves to amplify the aesthetics. The story, in spite of occasional typoes and inconsistencies, is quite well put together.\n\nMistakes were made, sure. But all in all, I think they did a pretty good job here.

I have many gripes with its implementation, but given its low price and short playthrough time, there’s no real reason for other gamebook and visual novel fans to not give it a try.\n\nDETAILED OPINIONS:\n\nVlad the Impaler is a horror-genre visual novel with RPG elements that features awesome gothic art and honestly disturbing writing—which I consider a plus in a horror story. Overall, my feelings about this game are pretty conflicted: there’s a lot done right, but there are a couple significant issues with it that are difficult to overlook.\n\nThe most immediately obvious issue is the seemingly un-proofread text: there are blatant errors, such as missing words, in just about every paragraph. I honestly find this bizarre: the content of all of the writing (the situations, word choice, overall tone, etc.) is quite good, and presumably required some care to write, so how can it possibly have so many errors?\n\nAnother annoyance is that there is no continuity in the overall story. Some late-game storylets refer back to earlier storylets that you may or may not have seen, and the chapter transitions are extremely jarring (how the heck did I go from exploring the sewers to on a rooftop with an assassin?!).\n\nFinally, the RPG elements seem really pointless. There’s no real control over which stats are boosted/penalized, so clearing the mandatory skill challenges seems very random. I’ve seen visual novel/RPG hybrids done well before (such as Long Live the Queen), but they were poorly implemented here.\n\nIf this were a longer or more expensive game, I couldn’t recommend it, but I think the quality of the art and writing is good enough to justify spending $1 and 30 minutes on the experience.\n","January 28","true","4.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I was propelled forward, from one macabre and disturbing moment to the next, my character stumbling through some poor choices, but mostly making progress.\n\nAnd then I got to an encounter which I failed and resulted in my death.  Okay, I think... I'll do it a little different this time.  I pick a new class, other encounters, avoid the ones that turned out badly.  I do better, I think, and then... I fail again.  At the same place.  I try again.  And again.  Every time, in spite of what I try, I fail at the same place.  I recognize right away that the game is just a little too obtuse in its delivery to create a cohesive narrative and method of approach.  I realize that in order to "get" this game, I would have to chart all the encounters, or at least a lot of them, and then figure out the best way of traversing the game.\n\nBut that sounds like too much work for a game that was already started to anger me more than entertain, so I just looked up someone else's guide on Steam and finally, after one more try, got through the obstacle that had held me up.  After that, the final chapter unfolded and I reached a successful conclusion.\n\nMy conclusion:  At this price, its worth the play, especially if the macabre is your thing.  The game has great atmosphere.  But its opaque.  There are simple mistakes, like misspelled words and poor grammer.  The game doesn't explain itself, which is fine, but you really don't feel like you are building a narrative, and you aren't.  You are having a series of semi-related encounters that either buff or nerf your character, which at some point results in death or the final chapter, which could also result in death.  But the conclusion was satisfying enough, and its very inexpensive, so I don't think you'll feel too badly if your opinion is less than mine.","February 7","true","2.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I was initially put off by the mixed reviews wondering if I should give it a chance or not, and for those of you in a like scenario the answer is a resounding "yes." The art is a Gothic dream with its monochromatic shading perfectly depicting the battle between light and dark taking place on the streets of Istanbul, and the music blends seamlessly into the background. Keep in mind that this is s stat-raising game, and a fairly challenging one at that: my recorded playtime (2 hrs) is how long it took me to get to the end with my cleric. Despite the numerous typos (mainly just missing words like "and" that are easily filled in by the player) this is overall a beautifully crafted game and I can't wait to finish it with all the other classes.","April 4","true","3.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
