And by the leveling, more skills are acquired. There are also more treasures to find, and there are some side quests involved.\nThe artwork, especially of the enemies, is good, and the music is nice with a pleasant variety.\nSo, do you need to play the first one to enjoy this one? Not really, but I would advise playing them in order for the cohesion of the long range story ---- and, at the low price for both ---- why not?\n\nAll in all, if you are a fan of these classic games, this one will keep you entertained for hours, and is a good addition to the series. Recommended for sure.\n","January 28","true","19.5"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

I've played many, many rpg games , this series is by far the worst ; seems to be made to make a fool of anyone stupid enough to buy it ...","March 5","false","10.5"," 3 of 12 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","3","12","0","0"

FANTASTIC, I only opened for two minutes and i was already blown away by the fantastic game menu! After play for 5 minutes of gameplay I was ready to write my review.

Because it is shorter.\nWay shorter.\nEnemies go after you like heat seeking missiles, there are a grand total of two sidequests(hey, the first one had none) and the story is so boring I didn't even bother to pay attention.\nI'm seriously thinking of never playing the third game, for the sake of sanity.","May 28","false","3.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
