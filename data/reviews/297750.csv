Now, that wasn't so hard, was it? And if you truly had played any of the predecessors, you'd realize that this version works just in the exact same way.\n\nBy the way, you can press spacebar to activate range info (I have command influence range as standard). There's a comprehensive list of keybindings in the manual.\n\nNow, off to the game. CC is a top down, real-time action WWII strategy game, with roots as far back as 1996. CC is legendary for those beknownst to it. It continues the style of a few other games in the series with a grand-campaign-style strategic map. This strategic map will progress on a turn basis, with battles occuring after a movement phase. Battles will take place one by one, where two battlegroups clash on the grand map. Available at some points on the strategic map are also air support and artillery (to inderdict). When you battle, you will get loaded onto the proper map for the region you're in on the Strategic map, and the real-time action starts. The battles are realistic and intricate, with morale, cover, angle of attack, suppression, ammunition and range all being important factors to the outcome.\n\nOf course, you can scale the difficulty yourself, do skirmishes instead of a grand campaign, and set up your own battles, or even campaign if I recall correctly. Last time I checked there was also a functional multiplayer. And I guess this would be really fun to play with (against) friends.\n\nAs for the price, I had to get it, not nescessarily because it's fairly priced (although I don't find it that steep) but because I want to support the making of anything CC, since the series are one of the few classics that stand out with great quality, which in my opinion should get all the support it could get. We have enough throwaway games today published by companies that care for nothing but money, with employees that have no passion for it whatsoever.","February 5, 2015","true","74.7"," 78 of 91 people (86%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","86","78","91","3","4"

I am severly disappointed about #1 The Opening Graphics (I feel like I am going back to 1991 when I first CHOOSE my mission). #2 The movement of troops and tanks are ABSOLUTELY horrible. #3 You are no longer able to change specific Units like you were able to in the past 2 Close Combats (granted this gives it more historical basis but when you are the Nazi's it is almost a sure loss.) There are more errors in this game than what I have reported, but this is what I have seen in the reviews that not many people/nobody has brought up.

However a few things really irritate me. One is the price! its utterly ridiculous and greedy by the developers they haven’t added nearly enough in the way of improvements or balancing to the game to warrant that price tag. This isn’t a HD remake or anything to that regard its just the same game engine  with the same ai and a few tweaks.  The Second is the games lack of support after launch. Where’s the patches? Literally where’s any attempt to improve the game or fix some of hit detection issues or ai bugs. The game has a terrible UI it really does , its so awkward you have to learn a fair few hotkeys to get anything done. I want to like this game more I really do its something so different and simulation esc but at the same time I cant stand the lack of support after release instead relying on fans to make the patches? Its scandalous. I feel sorry for diehard fans because from what ive read there’s better games in the Close Combat series its just this one is on steam  so of course people will buy it.

Very annoying.\n\nWould like to see this thing go on discount. Also, previous titles on Steam would be nice!\n\nAll in all, if you enjoy RTS, want a really historically accurate one, and don't get all huffy any time you see drawn sprites, you'll enjoy GtC.\n\nAlso, your Sherman is already on fire, even though you haven't bought the game.

Линия фронта уже давно была в тылу, и солдаты были отрезаны от основных сил и подкреления. Деревня превратилась в руины, округа была усеяна сгоревшей вражеской техникой, а мои ребята все еще окапывались и держали оборону и отражали штурмовавших гитлеровцев. Часть сил вражеской пехоты пыталась пройти через кустарник с запада, но была остановленна пулеметным расчетом, Базукой выбили еще одну Пуму, из которой экипах высыпал, как грибы, и разбежался в разные стороны.

Many times, the AI is supposed to be attacking, but just sits there....forever.  Pathing and tank disabling with hedges is to the point of ridiculous and absurd.  What was not broken in the original CC series they somehow systematically found a way to break?   How? why? who knows, but the remake is plagued with bad game design choices/paths.  Like Panther's in the Fog, it was a complete disapointment for me to the point I'm wary of any future purchases from this developer. Skip these remake titles from this developer and just buy the old windows 95/98 versions.\n\nBefore someone says..ya but..ya no!...lol.  The multiplayer is not that special and yes..the old CC had multiplayer. (rolls eyes)  The only improvement is updated graphics and network abilities for new operating systems out there...but who cares if ya broke the game mechanics and playability?  (I've gone back to playing the windows 95/98 versions)","August 27, 2015","false","9.6"," 21 of 28 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","21","28","0","4"

After being away from the series for many years and losing a bout with nostalgia, i have decided to give it a second go. I must say that it feels like i have never left...\n\nIndeed, Gateway to Caen simply takes the old CC games (admittedly mostly the good parts) and adds a touch of polish and a new setting. The explosion, smoke and sound effects are much improved and the campaign/strategic map is nicelly done. I also like the new, more realistic mortar and fire support systems. I know that other factors have been revamped (weather, moral, weapons) but i think those changes are hard to see and the troops pretty much behave like they did back in the day.\n\nI have also seen many complaints about the price of the game being too steep for a fairly simple ''reboot''.  I must say that in this day and age it does feel a little bit pricey but that in the end, you will probably end up spending hundreds of hours on this game, which makes it pretty cheap by the hour.\n\nRecruits: Enjoy this vintage game.

When they are shot, men don't run: they hide and they get fear, when they are hit, they are wounded or directly killed. With the right click on an unit you can give several orders like fire, launch smoke, run, walk, sneak, defend and ambush, with very different effects on your men or on ennemies, also you have infantry, leaders, tanks, guns, machineguns, mortars, anti-tank support, flame-throwers as units and airplanes/mortars/guns as support.

The campaign mode is improved from the original, as it adds in a turn-based strategy layer to define how the real-time tactical game plays. The multiplayer matchmaking is not very effective, and I think it relies upon a forum to find opponents. Overall, I think the $40 price is too much for the scope of the game. There are plenty of campaigns, operations, missions, and you can create your own, to create several hours worth of gameplay. However it's limited in terms of scope, as you will always be fighting in the hedgerows and towns near Caen with British and German units. Watch for it on sale - definitely worth it around $20.

Since then, I've played on many of the releases and found them to be fantastic.  This game, however, has been a massive disappointment.  The interface is no bigger than 1024x768 and the map screen is a massive step backwards compared to previous releases, it just feels like a cramped mess.\n\nThe battles themselves are entertaining.  I mean, they’re still exactly the same as the old games, so yeah they are good!  However, the interface is really, really dated now.  Scrolling through the map is painful, especially if you're ina  hurry. Trying to select and give orders is infuriating.  The AI has not been improved at all (as far as I can tell).\n\nThe worst thing? The price.  My god. I’m all for supporting games like this, but £30?

Not the most in-depth one, but I've always liked how fluid the gameplay is for the most part in Close Combat. The new effects and sounds are a welcome addition, really brings the battles alive and the sound of a MG42 opening up is as terrifying as ever. The AI in combat is OK. I find it really depends of the scenario and difficulty. I stalled the Allied advance almost instantly in the Grand Campaign playing as Germans, but after playing 5 turn of operation "Digging in" as Allies, the AI is putting up a good fight. I also see improvement in the driving AI, it's still not perfect and tanks often swirl around like idiots, but once I ordered a Tiger tank to drive down a road just barely big enough for it, it did follow it flawlessly.\n\nSome might say the graphics are dated, but I would disagree. This is a top-down strategy game. Graphics rarely matter in this genre, and I must say, it does look rather good compared to the older games in the series.\n\nThe only gripes I really have are the new mortars introduced in PitF. Basically, when you order your mortar to shoot at a target, it takes 20-25 seconds to aim the first round, 5-6 seconds to aim the second and after that it starts to hit very accurately. This is devastating if you are not inside a multistory building. Also, the MG42 is a bit too accurate in my opinion. Most german infantry squads carry one and they fire 8 rounds per burst, making the extremely effective against the Allied infantry.\n\nBut all in all, it's a very good game. Of all the CCs I've played (CC2 through PitF), I rank it among the best in the series.\n\n8½/10","June 13, 2014","true","78.4"," 14 of 20 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","14","20","0","3"

I used to play this game religiously when it was first released almost 20 years ago. Having it remastered and re-released for modern operating systems is, quite literally, a dream come true. I thought I'd never play a Close Combat game again.\n\nDespite the decades old, hand-drawn graphics -- which are a totally charming aspect anyway -- this is another Close Combat which sticks to the forumla and delivers an unmatched tactical experience. This game really brings home what it is to command a Company in combat. Every last detail of your soldiers is considered, their ammunition, fatigue, morale, suppression, accuracy, and courage or cowadice. You will revel in their success and you will cringe at their destruction. You alone are responsible for both.\n\nNotable improvements include revamped explosion graphics, the addition of waypoints to movement orders, and, finally, persistent tracking of individual soldiers between battles. Your men maintain their kills, awards, and performance. A word of warning, don't become attached to a particular Platoon, because there is nothing more gut-wrenching than watching a decorated, three battle veteran, finally succumb to his own bravery.\n\nMy rating: 9/10. I cannot recommend this game enough. I am a biased reviewer, that's for sure, and if you're new to the series then perhaps you'd want to wait for the price to drop. However, if you're looking for a visceral, challenging, and realistic tactical strategy game, then you cannot go past Close Combat.

Very often you see the units getting stucked in each other. So the pathing could have been much better done.\n\n2. They could have improved the game so it's much more responsive. Just to move units takes an eternity... Like 10-15 minutes just to move a canon a few centimeters. Together with that and the unit easily gets stuck frustrates me a lot.\n\n3. No tutorial exist.\n\n4. Looks manual don't explain all things in game like for example how to deal with unintuitive battle group screen.\n\n5. 3D graphic would be great to have, instead of 2D where you see all ugly pixels (almost like in minecraft to exagerate a little or 10-15 year old games).\n\n6. A price tag as for a AAA game but which feels 10 years old, both regarding graphic and game play, is way to much. A price tag of $10-$15 max would be a better price. The price Valve and Slitherine takes feels like a scam to me.\n\n7. I need to have line of sight to shoot with most of my units. I can't even shoot through bushes. It's not very intuitive to use the mortal team for example. They seam to lack grenades as they never launch the grenades!? There is a mortal button I can press but it looks I can only use it once during a whole battle!!! Don't know if that button is for my mortal team!? If it is then I can only use that squad once in each battle more or less!? So why have a mortal team if so.\n\n8. The UI isn't very intuitive. When you for example want to zoom in to see units closer with mouse wheel you instead switch and start to look at other units!!! The line of sight thing is also something which frustrates me especially when you have canons which needs to move around to be able to shoot against tanks.\n\nSUGGESTIONS for next game:\n\n1. Much better graphic. You know 3D graphic from today.\n\n2. I hope next game will include more options regarding what you can do with units, like throwing grenades, using bazokas, use mortal team, etc... Right now it feels strategy light.\n\n3. An improved UI wouldn't hurt which is much more intuitive.\n\n4. Pathing and units which moves slightly faster could be improved. Units should move much faster if you choose "fast move". Units should almost run and not walk in slow motion.\n\n5.

The latter one including vehicles, armor and static weapons. The combat itself comes down to suppressing the enemy troops as you attempt to outflank them and using your support-platoon to deal with entrenched infantry and enemy armor. Your units may refuse to follow your orders, act on their iniative and even surrender if the situation is dire. Each side has a certain morale depending on previous battles and current events on the battlefield, if this drops to zero or you lost all victory points, you will loose the battle.\n\nThere's single battles, operations and campaigns in the singleplayer. In the latter two, you control serveral companies that you move in a turnbased-fashion around a larger map. Battles will most likely be fought on the same map serveral times during these, where you start off around  the victory points you control, a nice feature being that wrecks, craters and ruined buildings remain throughout the entire operation or campaign.\n\nThe negative aspects are that it does a poor job at explaining some of it's mechanics and evidently the previously mentioned graphics from 1995. And considering how little has changed since the previous release of "Panthers in the Fog", it's not really worth the current asking price. But if it's on sale, I would strongly reccomend it.","February 26","true","17.5"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","2"

If you want a slower paced, more strategic RTS experience, then this game is right up your alley.  On the battlefield, position, moral, ammo, physical conditioning, line of sight, and many other issues come into play as you decide where to place and move your soldiers.  Battles are slow, gripping affairs, as every single soldier is valuable and the fog of war is dense.  Indeed, it is very possible for matches to end in stalemates, as both sides decide that it is completely unsafe to advance into the open killing fields.\nOn the campaign map, you have to decide where to move troops and where to place support options.  Having artillery ready on a map can mean the difference between victory and defeat, but if you deploy your options in the wrong sectors, you may find that your lines and resources will be stretched completely thin.\nIt's very old fashioned, for sure, and it doesn't look great compared to Company of Heroes or any of the other modern RTSes.

It is a good idea but poorly executed.  I don't mind the 2D look but there needs to be more player aids to deal with it.  Often you cannot tell what unit has Line of Sight or what obstacles block LoS.  In addition, you are often engaged off the screen and scrolling around is tedious(esp. if you are being fired on by someone who is concealed and you have to play "find the pixel" to locate them).  You also cannot zoom in and out in order to deal with this problem. The second issue is the speed of the game.  It is slow even on "fast." Seriously, it takes a minute for infantry to "move fast" 30 meters(with no obstacles) in game.  While it is probably a feature, it seems like a work around for control/AI problems. The third issue is you cannot rebind the hot-keys.  While there isn't that many, they aren't that logical.  The alternative is to find the unit, right click it and find the command you want.  Fourth is the inability to customize squads.  This makes it extremely difficult to play axis because there is almost no way to defeat Churchill tanks in the 6-8 battles I played.  I have tried to ambush it in side but that didn't work either.  This inability to deal with heavy armor is compounded by the fact that you cannot retreat(or I haven't figured it out).  Lastly, there is no tutorials when there is clearly a button for them(it is greyed out).  It would of helped in order to deal with the controls.  Overall, this game feels half finished and the price(while on sale) was not worth it.","June 10, 2014","false","3.6"," 15 of 28 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","15","28","0","1"

I had two section with HQ platoon moving into the northern end of the map as similar amount of men to the south attached to a single Cromwell tank.

They responded with high firepower and Rifle section flanked. We repelled the jerries at distillerie however as we moved in. We ran into an large Panzergrenadier company with several SKDZ vehicles and backed by Mortars. We suffered heavy mortar fire and I directed the centre to flank the PzGren as i resumed the south force to clear through the south unopposed.

They cannot, by any means, pass through such an obstacle.\n\nAlso, said tanks will think it's a great idea to dance around a chokepoint, e.g. one created by another tank or a stationary gun. Since they are deadly afraid of touching a hedgerow, they will just rotate on the spot, looking for another way to go to their destination. So just sit near a chokepoint, ready to one-shot them from their vulnerable back.\n(Even weak allied tanks can easily take out Tigers at great distances this way(as long as they hit, which is not a given, but rear attack seems to pretty much equal instakill.).\n\nSo yeah...I liked CC series back in the day. But Slitherine obviously does not do anything to improve the series. They polish up effects so things look prettier, but stupid pathfinding and tank AI were in since the beginning, and nothing seems to have changed.\n\nI got this as part of a humble bundle at 10$ tier, and I feel it's not worth even that. While generally I would like a modern version of the Classic CC games, this studio does not seem capable of delivering that.\n\nEdit: Oh, also, forgot to mention: I am writing this review since I accidently blocked my only way out from deployable area with a stationary gun. So, my tanks are trapped in a corner. Yay. Since its a tank division, tanks is all i brought(really, ersatz truppen or tiger tanks? no competition) .

The game doesn't bring many new features, but this is not a bad thing, because Close Combat series was always good, so is no point to change much. For someone who never played it, the game can looks little bit simple, but a soon you start to play you can notice that it is an advance strategy game, not like Cannon Fodder :-) if you know it. If you don't like the price, wait for the sale and grab a discount. I definitely recommend this game for players who likes WWII real strategy games. Game is very easy to learn and offer many maps.

It is the same engine as the Close Combats of past times, with the exception of the wonderful new explosion and smoke graphics - they look great, but thats where it all ends for graphics - vehicles and human models still move awkwardly and have extremely poor animations.\n\nGameplay wise, the AI is still horrible and cannot mount any sort of offensive movement or use terrain with any advantage.

What got me to like this series was how it got you close to the action and provided you with an efficient interface to command your combating soldiers. To me every battle I've played has been a mini *insert-your-favorite-war-flick-here*. Before long the battlefield is scarred by explosions and fire, the dead and dying are piling at the victory points and you are sitting by the keyboard ruing for Fritz or Cambell who's lying in ambush trying to capture that Sherman/Tiger-tank off-guard.\n\nThe strategy portion of the game is as it's been since it's inception and as always to me a distraction, I find the heart to be in the battles. Each battle can range from 30-60 minutes so set aside some time if you choose to play the campaign.\n\nThe system is impeccable, with only minor changes here and there from the previous games, and as always a wonderful historical accuracy. The battles and missions who are just based on history are noted as such.\n\nThe interface is the only main concern I have. But this may be because I'm so used to the bottom-centered interface after years of playing that I'm unable to get to grips with the changes. I haven't played so much yet so maybe after a couple of more hours I'll get a hold of the new setup.\n\nEvery battle is a story and if you have the time to dedicate you'll not be sorry. This is if you have a little interest for military history and good strategy games, but who doesn't? Now I just hope they'll start porting the classics too, I'd like to play The Russian Front and Invasion Normandy again, this time with support for multiplayer via Steam.

It's a fun little addition to the Close Combat family and for those who love this game it's more of the old, good classic gameplay with a few new fancy things (the explosions are neat). It's also a good part to introduce the newcomers, as the campaign map is pretty straightforward and the battles are on large, mostly open maps which give you a lot of leeway and let you play more with the armored troops.\n\nThe only con? The price of course - I don't doubt that Matrix games put at least a little effort in making Gateway to Caen, but there is nothing that justifies the expense. Wait for the discount.","July 6, 2015","true","22.1"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

Micromanagement is (still) required to prevent tanks moving in utterly stupid ways. Most galling is the little jig they can do, before crossing a small hedge, only to be tracked (movement disabled) which wouldn't have been as likely to happen if they hadn't spent so long dancing on top of that hedge. They seem to like turning 330 degrees one way, when 30 degrees the other way would be quicker; and turning to face their rear, weaker, armour towards the enemy as the result of a small tweak to position. This stuff should be fixed by now.\nThe strategic map is clear as mud to me. I'm off to read the manual again. Fog of war should apply during battle, not operating game mechanics. There are new features (units moving past each other, resting, merging, ...) which seem great, but they've not been implemented clearly. I'll keep at it though, because the game is ...\nGood: Good old Close Combat (sort of computerised Avalon Hill Squad Leader) working at full resolution on an up-to-date PC. You either love these games or you don't. I wouldn't pay "full price" for this, due to the issues still not fixed, but am very happy to have paid "above the average" to get it in a Humble Bundle. I'd pay the same again (each) to get refreshed versions of all the old CC games I've already got.\nDon't buy this if you expect a fast-paced 3D experience such as from the Total War series.","July 11, 2015","true","33.8"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

If you like game that rewards patience and strategy over reflex and brashness, if you like a game that lets you impliment in real time a course of action only for it to fail because your soldiers cower under the realities of battle conditions or heroicly stand to the last man and snatch victory from defeat because of courage and comradery, then this game is for you.\n\nI never met anyone who did not love this game once they learned to understand its intricacies. Every bullet counts. Not just because you can run out of bullets but also because, desperate, a courageous AI will pick up weapons and ammo from the battlefield dead while a coward will break and run with your best vehicle and ammo right before you need him most.\n\nThe interface is clumsy for the modern era and their will be a learning curve as this game looks like it belongs in Windows 95 not 10. The graphics are not optimum for the modern era but functional. Vehicle drivers are terrible and so you will need to micromanage the drivers to keep them on the path. this may be the weakest part of the entire series.\n\nStill, if you can get past that then you will find the best Company sized military strategy game available, far exceeding the modern AAA such as company of hero's. it doesnt have there AAA looks, but its much more realistic psycology model and battlefield tactics makes this an infnatry commanders dream training tool.","August 30, 2015","true","17.1"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

Gameplay is similar to A Bridge Too Far, the last Close Combat game I played, and this is a good thing. Really, this is what I like about these games - the realistic battles that require some degree of actual skill to succeed at.\n\nThe map editor feels awkward compared to the older style, but seems like it allows much better campaigns to be developed once you get the swing of things. Infact, there is a whole new campaign design to it, albiet one I don't personally find overly interesting.\n\nFavorite new stuff: New additions such as long distance mortar and artillery support are kinda neat. There are lots of little tweaks and stuff to the same units, and a bunch of new ones. Quite a few UI updates.\n\n\nLeast favorite new stuff: As I say, I'm not a fan of the new campaign setup beyond the above mentioned parts. I might just not be great at it, but it's really too restrictive to feel like a proper grand strategy element. It feels like you need to replicate the actual events of the battles depicted to actually succeed in most of the campaigns, which is not great when you're a pretty casual WWII history buff like me.\n\nAlso, they seem to have removed the ability to see LOS during deployment, something I remember being in A Bridge Too Far, and really a ♥♥♥♥-er of many otherwise good plans. Perhaps it's a realism thing, but I think a real MG team would notice if they were setting up facing directly into a a slight bump that would completely block their line of sight.\n\nSumming it up, I am a  mixed on it because I think A Bridge Too Far does just as good a job of the parts that I enjoy. Maybe even does it a little better, really. If you somehow have a working copy of A Bridge Too Far, you might want to check out some gameplay videos of the grand strategic mode to see if it's your thing before dropping $40 on it.\n\nDunno if it's worth $40 if you have a working copy of Bridge Too Far, but it's the game you expect, for sure.","June 13, 2014","true","120.3"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","2","8","0","0"
