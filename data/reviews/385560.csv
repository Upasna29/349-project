I played it multiple times on Xbox 360 years ago and it was great fun, one of the best Metroidvanias I have ever played. I also replayed the game on Xbox One when they added backwards compatibility and then again on PC when it was given away for free on the Epic Games client. Now it's on Steam and I bought it day one. What does that tell you?\n\nIf you've never played this game before, think near-future 2.5D Metroidvania set in a mazlike military base. You kill enemies, search for hidden collectibles and slowly build a futuristic suit which allows you to double jump, swim, breathe underwater and power punch enemies into oblivion. It's a blast.","May 3","true","3.0"," 84 of 103 people (82%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","82","84","103","9","5"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/recommended/385560/","TeamTom","TeamTom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/","2819 products in account","Product received for free\n\nShadow Complex Remastered is a remake of the critically acclaimed Shadow Complex, which was released on the Xbox Live Arcade back in August 2009. The remake was released on Steam in May 2016, with a console version of the game being released in March 2016. The Microsoft Windows store offered the game for free back in December 2015 for a brief amount of time. Having no exposure to the console version of the game, I went into this game only with the knowledge that it was one of the better games to come out of the Xbox Live Arcade.\n\nGame play is done in a 2.5D platforming style which includes a handful of 3D elements.  Your movement is restricted to two-dimensional systems though.  You find yourself in the middle of a huge spy plot, as you explore an underground base which is holding an entire army ready for overthrowing the American government. Throughout this underground complex, you are faced with plenty of different puzzles to solve. The puzzles aren’t massively complicated; they normally involve some sort of jumping mechanic. Other puzzles will require the use of other pieces of equipment which you will discover throughout the course of the story.  These pieces of equipment vary from different weapons such as rocket launchers, grenades, foam guns (question mark?), grappling hooks, all the way to supersonic speed for running through walls and boosted jumps for scaling walls.\n\nThe gun play in Shadow Complex is a little tricky to get a hang of. The game uses twin stick controls for aiming meaning you don’t always get a huge amount of accuracy.  The 2.5D environment also causes a lot of confusion and hassle when trying to aim at enemies but you have to be in a certain position in order to shoot at enemies in the rear of the scene.  You will come across plenty of enemies whilst exploring, these can be dispatched in a number of ways, using range combat, or an easy to use melee combat system which changes style depending on where you are attacking for example, if you are jumping from above, you’ll land on top of the enemy to knock them out, whereas attacking from behind will result in you being a little more stealthy.\n\nBoss fights throughout the story mode differ a fair amount between them. None of them are your usual style fight where you just volley a ton of ammo in their general direction. A lot will take into consideration the environment you are fighting in, such as needing to throw grenades underneath a tank to hit its weak spot. I found the boss fights to be a nice challenge which you wouldn’t otherwise get from the regular enemies you’ll come across.  As you unlock new abilities and pieces of equipment, you’ll often find yourself in a position to be able to backtrack to previously visited locations.\nEven though this is a remastered game, which runs on the Unreal 4 Engine, I was a little disappointed with the graphical fidelity of this title. The environments look really poor, and at times you are able to see the textures quite close up and they are really pixelated which take the edge of the remastered effect. The character models look average, nothing special sadly. Animation in character’s faces can be a little off-putting at times if you focus on them whilst they are speaking, as well as a few awkward movements in cut scenes to boot.\n\nPlot wise, the game is fairly interesting but somewhat cheesy at times. The opening prologue of the game bares no relevance to the actual story itself so I was a bit confused as to why it was included. The main protagonist is Jason Flemming, who happens to be on a weekend away with his new girlfriend, Claire. Your new girlfriend gets kidnapped and you are tasked with finding her and bringing her to safety. As the plot unravels everything turns out not to be the way it seemed. Although a lot of it is largely predictable, I still found myself interested in finding out what happens at the end. The dialog between Jason and Claire can be quite cringy at times and often felt like it was written by a twelve year old.  Thankfully you don’t need to follow the story too much in order to get the most out of Shadow Complex.\n\nThe voice acting across the game is nothing special, and you may even be better off turning it off as it did make me wince with awkwardness at times. The rest of the game’s sound effects are as you’d expect from an action game like this. There are moments where you really should be hearing a sound effect, such as background noise when you are on a factory floor, but you don’t hear anything. This can really knock you out of the immersion of any game, and sadly it happened all too frequently throughout this one.\n\nShadow Complex comes with a variety of different difficulty settings, most will be sufficiently challenged on the normal mode and however you can change the settings on the fly, and so I would advise start as high as you can to see how well you handle the combat. The easy mode is no challenge at all and you may find yourself getting bored of the combat system if you aren’t being challenged.\n\nI wouldn’t consider Shadow Complex Remastered to have any replay ability unfortunately. There are a number of achievements which people may be after which will force a number of different play throughs, but the regular gamers amongst us will find themselves being satisfied with the single play through of the story. I did like the in game leader boards comparing your progression with people on your friends list who also have the game though; it adds a little competitive nature to an otherwise single player experience.\n\nOther than the control issues being a bit of a pain in the 2.5D environments, the only other technical issue I had was that even when playing in full screen mode, your mouse does not get locked into the game window, meaning anyone who plays with more than one screen will find themselves minimizing their game more times than you would even believe to imagine. The only way I was actually able to play the game without this happening constantly was to move away from my preferred control method of keyboard and mouse to use an Xbox controller. Granted this got around this annoying technical problem that brought along its own problems with the lower accuracy when shooting due to using the joysticks rather than the more precise mouse movement.\n\nShadow Complex Remastered shouldn’t really be classed as a remastered edition in my opinion. This is the first time the game has come to the PC platform, and it doesn’t really show off the platform to its full potential.  The game play itself is enjoyable with a lot of interesting and unique abilities at your fingertips, but there is so much room for a potentially amazing game here that I was left feeling disappointed at the end.  The $14,99 price tag is probably nudging the boundaries of being over the average for this game so you may want to wait till the drops in price a little bit before picking it up.\n\nTom's Score Card\n1) Stay away\n2) Not Recommended\n3) Only recommended when on sale\n4) Recommended\n5) Highly recommended\n6) This is a must play\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please give it a thumbs up.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/el_kemosabe/recommended/385560/","el_kemosabe","El Kemosabe","http://steamcommunity.com/id/el_kemosabe/","1115 products in account","Even on my fifth playthrough, Shadow Complex is still an incredibly enjoyable game.\nHaving played Shadow Complex four times on my Xbox I was very excited to finally see the Remastered version on Steam. Shadow Complex is a 2.5D side-scroller developed by ChAIR Entertainment that originally released on Xbox in 2009. Jump forward seven years and the game has been remastered and released for PC on Steam. In Shadow Complex you play as Jason Flemming, after your girlfriend Claire is kidnapped by a strange organisation you venture into their base to find and rescue Claire. Unfortunately for you this organisation is anything but friendly and they have some serious firepower, you’ll need to learn how to use it if you want to survive here.\n\nShadow Complex doesn’t have cutting edge graphics but it looked good when it came out and it looks even better with the updated graphics now. The visual effects are also pretty good and all of the in-game models look good too.\n\nThe game features a large map with indoor and outdoor portions, it takes roughly 8-10 hours to beat the game. You’ll see pretty much all of the map just by playing through the story but there are some secret areas where you’ll find upgrades. These upgrades range from how many grenades you can carry to how much armour you have and they’re incredibly useful, especially on the higher difficulties.\n\nAs you progress through the game it does get a fair bit more difficult, again even more so on higher difficulties. There are a few advanced enemy types but generally you’ll just find more enemies, sometimes in awkward positions making it even harder to fight them. Every so often you’ll also run into a boss. The boss fights are enjoyable and tough to begin with but once you figure out the main strategy to beat a boss they become less challenging. Generally these strategies involve the different equipment items you’ll find over the course of the game: grenades, missiles and a strange foam which prevents enemies/objects from moving. While the main purpose of these items is to break through part of the environment (for example using a grenade to get through a locked door) they can also be used to great effect in combat.\n\nThe other item used to get through things in the environment is your gun! Whatever gun you have (the first one you find is a basic pistol but you’ll find others as you progress through the game) can be used to break through some objects, such as metal coverings for vents, allowing you to reach a new area. The gun is also what you’ll mainly use during combat, though you also have a melee attack. The gun is obviously good at range while the melee attack is always your best bet when you’re close enough to the enemy as it’s an insta-kill. The melee attack triggers a mini-cutscene, of which there are a few variations, in which you pretty much beat the crap out of whatever enemy it is you’re attacking. Of course, there are some enemies who can’t be killed with the melee attack but the enemies you’ll see most regularly can.\n\nThere are some other pieces of equipment in the game too. You get a flashlight early on in the game which is obviously used to illuminate dark areas in the game but, when shone on objects, it also highlights objects which can be destroyed by your other equipment, for example orange highlighting means it can be destroyed with gunfire. Without giving too much away, you’ll also find some high-tech armour along the way, each piece of the armour adds a new mechanic to the game. You’ll find the armour parts as you progress through the story.\n\nSpeaking of the story, it’s actually quite good. The story of Jason trying to rescue Claire is reasonably interesting but it’s the game’s backstory that’s really enjoyable. There are a few points in the game where you’ll be able to listen in to the conversations that take place between some of your enemies in the game. These conversations give you an idea of what the organisation in the game is like and what their goals are. Missing or ignoring them won’t make the game’s story hard to understand but you will really miss out of some cool stuff. The story is based around ideas in Orson Scott Card’s books. While I haven’t read any of his work it seems that he has strong, often controversial right wing views. It’s worth mentioning that Shadow Complex isn’t politically driven so don’t worry if you don’t agree with his views.\n\nReturning to upgrades, as well as the collectible upgrades you find you’re also ‘upgraded’ through collecting EXP and levelling up (an automatic process). The Hardcore and Insane difficulties offer more EXP for killing enemies/completing objectives, meaning you’ll level up considerably faster, but these difficulties are also a lot harder to beat. When you level up, three things happen. Firstly, you’re maximum health will increase. Secondly, you’ll return to full health (this has saved me from death a fair few times). Lastly, one of your stats (such as accuracy) will be increased (some levels also have special bonuses, for example the full map is revealed when you reach level 20). The level cap is level 50 which will take an incredibly long time to get to (after 6 hours I’m level 12, playing on hardcore difficulty) but you keep your level when you start a new game (though you lose your weapons, items etc.)\n\nAs much as I love Shadow Complex, it’s not without its issues. The biggest problem I have with the game is the save system, there are checkpoint rooms every so often where you can save your progress and from where you’ll restart if you die or quit and then return to the game later. I always prefer it when games allow you to save at any point and it can be quite inconvenient in Shadow Complex, especially on the higher difficulties, since when you die you’ll have to walk back through a fair bit of the map (dying won’t respawn enemies but when you quit and come back the enemies you killed will be there again). My second issue with the game is with the aiming controls. Being a 2.5D game, not all of the enemies are exactly to the left or right of you, sometimes they’re off at an angle or horizontal to you. The problem is (at least when playing with a controller) that the aiming system is designed for a 2D game, in other words it’s made for you to fire in straight lines in front, behind, above, below or anything in between. Because of this, when aiming at an enemy who’s not in the same plane as you, you have to be aiming at just the right angle so that the gun aims into the scenery/level rather than straight ahead. I realise that’s probably not the best description of the problem but basically it makes some enemies incredibly difficult to hit which results in you spending more time than necessary trying to hit them, often translating into you losing a fair bit of health. Other than that the controls in the game are solid which is important since there’s a fair bit of platforming in the game.\n\nVerdict\nEasily one of my favourite games, Shadow Complex is a great 2.5D side-scroller with enjoyable, challenging gameplay. If you’re a fan of the genre then this is definitely a game you ought to have in your library.\n\nLone Ranger Reviews.\n\nEl K.","May 18","true","6.5"," 36 of 40 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","36","40","0","3"

I was afraid it would be another bad PC port, and I was wrong. It's just like I remember it from XBOX 360, and works pretty darn well too. Never any bugs or lag. Enough about the porting side of things. Let's talk why this game is good.\n\nThe game starts out with you having nothing but a pistol. As you progress through the game, you get better weapons and useful side weapons. These can be used to access parts you weren't able to access earlier. The game's story is actually really short, and you can finish it in under 2 hours (hence the achievement in which you have to complete it under 2 hours.) However, there's a lot of items placed around the map that take a while to get if you want to actually 100% complete the game. What I really like is you can complete the game with 100% items (which is quite satisfying, as most games won't let you do that until after the game ends) or with the least amount of items you possibly can. Whether you're wanting to do a speedrun or absolutely complete the game, it's all fun.\n\nThe only negatives I really have about this game is that the graphics aren't completely "remastered." They look just a bit worse than I remember them looking back when I first play this. That doesn't take away from the fun at all.\n\nPros: Great for speedrunning, great for taking your time to complete 100%, super fun combat, smooth gameplay, replay value (leveling up, trying different approaches), overall a unique game.\n\nCons: Graphics are old looking.","May 3","true","10.2"," 31 of 43 people (72%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","72","31","43","4","1"

You have all of the graphical options you'd need, and it runs at a constant 60fps for me.\n\nThe game is a metroidvania game, in the sense that you have a vast map that you can go back through at any time. As you progress through the game, you will unlock new upgrades and weaponry that allow you to access areas you couldn't get to before.\n\nIt's incredibly fun to slowly grow stronger and stronger. Eventually you'll be going through previous areas much faster than before, because you're now more experienced at the game, your upgrades make you a badass, and the enemies will crumble under your might.\n\nThe game will still pose a threat to you in later areas. Different enemy types will force you to react differently. There are multiple ways of disposing of your enemies to keep the game fresh. Not only do you have different weapons you can use, but the environment can be used to your advantage. Many rooms allow you to flank enemies from underneath or above, and you may shoot drones off of walls, which will then explode. If enemies are caught in the radius, they will go flying. If the game is too easy/hard, you can change the difficulty, which will also reward you with less or more XP depending on how difficult it is.\n\nThe combat is actually incredibly satisfying. Headshotting, exploding and meleeing enemies has them ragdoll away, while it rewards you with XP. The PC version allows for keyboard+mouse or gamepad. Both systems work totally fine, and you can actually switch between them on the fly. Throughout the game, I've been using an Xbox 360 controller to play, but during the 2-3 turret sections in the game, I just switch to the mouse because the game allows for totally free aiming during those points, so the mouse is far superior. Throughout the rest of the game, I found both control schemes to be equally as good.\n\nThe story is the game's weak point. It's really quite stereotypical and forgettable. You try to save "the girl", and that's more or less the only real plot point. It doesn't bother me, as I just play the game for the gameplay, and it's quite evident that the devs didn't put too much care into the story.\n\nOverall, I really love the game. I've played through it 3 times now on different platforms, as the gameplay always grips me. Even though I've gone through it that many times, I barely remember the story. (That's how non-existent it is). If you enjoy the genre, you should definitely pick this game up, I had an absolute blast with it.","May 4","true","8.2"," 30 of 43 people (70%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","70","30","43","3","5"

The premise is simble, America in the future, has a home grown group of terrorists trying to force a civil war, Jason Flemming (the main character you play as) Meets a girl at a bar and decide to go exploring a cave as a date. The cave turns out to hold the main base of the terrorists and she gets captured and you have to save the girl and save the day. There is some fun dialogue and the writing is entertaining but not memorable.  What is memorable is the gameplay. If you ever liked the Metroid series or Castlevania series, you know exactly how this game works. Find a interesting bit of gear, this gear lets you explore the area until you either fight a boss or find new gear. Once you get the new gear, you can carry on forward or go back to get to areas you could not get to before and find more goodies hidden around the map that way.  Repeat. The combat is fun and entertaining with ever improving quality of guns (5 total) and uprades for your character, Either Missles, grenades, Foam gun, Hook shot device, or even double and triple jumping and hyperspeed running where you can even go zipping by enemies while on the roof!\nThe only real negative I have for this game is I originally bought and played this on my Xbox360 and it played completely fine, smooth frame rates and seemless transitions between sections of the map. Here on PC, I can get frozen screens, stuttering and for some reason the game likes to default to the lowest quality graphics settings whenever I exit and log back into the game, forcing me to change them back whenever I start playing again. All in all, the stuttering and temporary freezes happen enough to be noticed but not enough to really interfere negatively with the game experience itself. I Do have to wonder if the devs ported this without being fully optimized properly. I have other games with much higher system demands than this that I can run without these problems, and other games using the same engine as this don't have these problems either.\n\nTo sum up, If you have missed the old school Metroid style of exploring for fun and profit, You will most likely love this game and is well worth the price.","May 5","true","4.7"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","9","12","0","0"

Visually looks like it drops to 20FPS at times.  [4.7GHz 4-core with R9280X and 16GB RAM, Win7U] [210 FPS steady with dips to 140 sometimes to 63 (!?), 180 steady during combat. ]\n- The sense of pathfinding is ruined when direct lines, telling you everything, are on by default. [press "X" on the map to change this]\n- HD is not kind to the faces.  Reminds me of Silent Hill.\n- There are 6 AA modes, and they won't tell you what they are.  Would love to know what "Alternate AA" means.\n\nAs always, it's 2.5D and therefore a gamble with aiming at times.  Not the worst implementation, but the annoyance 'is' there.\n\nYes; It's a $15 game, and I dont regret the purchase.","May 8","true","2.1"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","4","6","0","0"

A great Metroidvania, and more like Metroid than Castlevania (which is a little bit unusual for the genre, at least until Axiom Verge hit). Slickly put together and enjoyable, decently quick pace too. The graphics are not going to set any new standards in 2016 (they rocked in 2009, though), but the developers were thoughtful enough to do a proper HD upgrade to the game and you also have some advanced graphics controls that can dial things in. At high resolutions, the game looks great and plays smooth. I'm on strong hardware for 2013, but I get the impression you really don't need a monster rig to run this thing at all. I mean, it was a 360 game, no amount of HD textures is going to change that :)\n\nOne thing I loved:\nThe shooting gameplay is nice and tight, with a hint of a twin-stick twitch shooter feel if you disable the auto-aiming.\n\nOne thing that bugged me:\nSave points seem a little infrequent. For a game that lived on HDDs from its inception, sure does rely on the old "Save Room" mechanic heavily. It's somewhat frustrating to die after getting a pickup, for example, but before saving your progress. But this isn't a game defining frustration, just a minor annoyance and a common problem for the genre until more recent games mostly opted for autosaving on important things like item pickups and boss fights, in addition to save points.\n\nGreat game though, so far, really immersive and the gameplay is right up there with Axiom Verge for enjoyable, Metroid-inspired side scrolling shooter gameplay (though less inventive, at least so far - no out-there weapons).","May 9","true","7.6"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","0"

I have been having an absolute blast with it.\nThe enemies are hard to fight and provide a good challenge on all skill levels. Moving to different areas to get a better shot at you.\n\nThe upgrades are not so rapid you feel like you are getting too powerful too quick. It is interesting to see the protagonist moving from being afraid of killing to a powerful killing machine. And unlike some other games he does not whine about shooting people, it is more comments like "oh great something I can shoot at that does not require me to kill someone."\n\nEven though it is does seem weird that you are going to such great lengths to save a girl that the game implies you met the night before at a bar....\n\nWhen you backtrack it is for logical reasons and there is enough new content you meet on the way it is not overly tedious.

Was excited that this game finally came out on PC as I thought it would never come. However, after playing this game I was throughly let down. This game is nowhere near the caliber of and is actually vastly inferior to games made 30 years ago such as: Metroid (NES), Super Metroid, Super Mario Bros., Contra (NES), Castlevania:SotN. Control mechanics are atrocious: very floaty, imprecise, and clunky. The game isn't necessarily difficult to play because of it, but just isn't honed enough to make this a fun fine-tuned run 'n gun platformer in the style of the games mentioned above. You can tell right away when you start walking and jumping around - just absolute slop.\n\nThe game is also billed as a platformer. Platformers require tight, responsive, and precise controls; this game just doesn't have it.\n\nGames of this type which I actually recommend: Oniken, Odallus, Bionic Commando:Rearmed, Exile's End (cheap budget but way better than this junk), Axiom Verge, Super Cyborg (Contra-like), Strider, Vulgar the Viking, maybe Shovel Knight etc.\n\nGame is also bloated with crappy cut-scene story... yes, you CAN skip them, but why should I even have to bother with getting my game interrupted?\n\nI would maybe buy this game for $2.50, but $15 is exceedingly too much. I am in the process of requesting a refund.","June 3","false","0.4"," 1 of 7 people (14%) found this review helpful","14","1","7","0","1"
