The Edward Gorey-esque opening title sequence is brilliantly done, as is all the artwork throughout. Gameplay and progression are rather refreshing for this genre. HER Interactive has added some nice and unique investigative methods, which allows you in the title role to really show your stuff. The game asks you to pay attention to what's happening in each scene, but doesn't get abusive if you don't get something right the first time.\n\nThe storyline and plot are clever and immersive, with several twists and turns. Everyone is a suspect and everyone has their own agendas. The end result (without giving anything away), is actually satisfying. The vocals are well done too, as the characters range from seemingly smart to down right ditsy and don't miss a beat. There are a few timed puzzles that keep you on your toes, but again nothing so taxing that you won't be able to finish the game. Another fact in its favor is that it runs smoothly and without bugs. Money well spent!\n\n","July 3, 2015","true","8.4"," 19 of 21 people (90%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","90","19","21","2","9"

It suddenly stoped three days ago. And I have done everything that was recomended on the Website of HER Entertainment. Sadly, this also doesn't work.\n\nI wonder if other people also have this problem? That the game shuts down at halfway through the progress, and never again can be started. If it's the same with your program please give a shout about that.\n\nAt the moment I can't recomend the game, because I have to reason, that I might not the only person affected by these troubles.","April 20, 2015","false","4.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Its up to you to find them and then figure out which ones match to solve the puzzles on the screen. A fan with a broken power cord? Match it with the sticky tape. A piece of paper stuck the the ceiling? Match it with the fixed fan to blow it down. It's a enough of a twist that it gives the dosier games a unique feel. The voice actor who plays Nancy in Her Interactives main Nancy Drew series is back for the dosier games and gives a good performance, in fact all the voice acting is good as is the music and general presentation. The plots are suprisingly good for this kind of game too and I found myself quite caught up as the mystery deepened. Reccomended for fans of Hidden Object games or the main Nancy Drew series who are looking for something a little different.","April 18, 2015","true","4.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

At first seems simplistic, but it's the same thing you always do in Pt&Ck without as many transitions to and from an inventory bar - it's a more streamlined approach. The P&C segments are routinely broken up by decent minigames throughout. Individual lines of dialogue can also be skipped, a rare treat. Other than a couple of overly tricky challenges, a surprisingly engaging and enjoyable game.","January 10, 2015","true","3.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"
