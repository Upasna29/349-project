"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rocketkiwi/recommended/255710/","rocketkiwi","rocket2guns","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rocketkiwi/","183 products in account","This is an outstanding game. This is an exceptionally outstanding citybuilder game, in a genre that for too long, has been deeply troubled with over-casualization, poor optimization, ill-thought out concepts, microtransactions, and general publisher shenangans.\n\nHighs:\n\n* Excellent Performance. I find that my city runs extremely well on my laptop even as it grows. I have not really noticed any dips in performance. The game seamlessly transitions between following an entity, and zooming out to broadly appreciate my traffic network.\n\n* Intuitive game mechanics. I was able to jump straight in and make assumptions about mechanics that made sense, and those were reflected in the game. As an example, I assumed people would use a variety of methods to get to work (hop on the metro, then take a bus), When I tracked people, they would do this.\n\n* Full Simulation. Things just make sense, you build a dam - the water level raises. People go to the store. People go to work. The water gets dirty from pollution. I get a sense that the city is a living and breathing entity - it gives me context to the experience.\n\n* Free, Focused Construction. You place roads and zones freely, focused around the placement of the roads. The zones are indelibly linked to this. It was a great design decision and simplifies the more annoying aspects of construction. It also makes the transport very obvious as one of the key aspects of the game.\n\nLows:\n\n* The listed city population seems much lower than it should be. My city looks like it should be about 100,000 people, but the listed population is only 30,000.\n\n* Not enough snapping options. This makes it really hard to make your own cloverleaf in highways if you are particulary OCD about this kind of thing, it's almost impossible to make angles of a similar basis repeatedly.\n\n* The Metro + Bus placement lacks feedback and is difficult to expand once done. I feel that you are really fairly blindly approaching this, at least at the start. Over time I might grow to understand this more. Also the numbers don't often line up well. My metro station might say "100 per week" but in the overall transport graph only 20 people are said to be using the metro.\n\nVerdict:\n\nIf you like citybuilders, buy this game. Not since SimCity 4 Rush Hour have I enjoyed an experience this much. I find it hard to suggest major ways to improve the concept. I strongly dislike casual approaches to the genre, and this is not one of those. Yet I also think it makes the genre more accessible.","March 10, 2015","true","59.5"," 2,793 of 2,881 people (97%) found this review helpful 89 people found this review funny","97","793","2","89","48"

At this point I was doing terrible with electricity, because I really didn't want to make many coal plants, so the second I saw Dams unlocked I saved to make one. I found a great spot that could solve my energy needs forever, and placed the dam. As I clicked I knew I made a terrible mistake. I made the dam directly beside the densest part of my Residential District. Water poured over the side of the dam and into the city, drowning my population and creating abandoned buildings. When the water finally calmed down it was in the form of a lake in the center of the city, halfway in residential, halfway in commercial. In an attempt to fix this I started pumping the water out (which actually seems to have worked), but I put the output in a place where it flowed into both of my main water pumps. And while I was only pumping plain water out of my city, the game counted it as waste water. I was feeding my citizens fresh water poop. So while water was killing the center of my city, poop water was killing the rest. The surge of water also managed to destroy my garbage collection, so I got this terrible mix of overflowing rivers, overflowing garbage, and overflowing sickness.\n\nAll in all an absolutely hilarious experiance. Great game.","March 14, 2015","true","25.0"," 2,381 of 2,455 people (97%) found this review helpful 2,756 people found this review funny","97","381","2","756","18"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/umph/recommended/255710/","umph","Umph","http://steamcommunity.com/id/umph/","129 products in account","In 2013, after 10 years of waiting, the Sim City community of modders, fans, and aficionados rushed out to purchase the fifth installment of Sim City. Ten years is a long time to wait for a game, but people had a lot of faith in Maxis when they announced the title. Long story short, it was a massive dissapointment. Maxis and EA crippled Sim City 5 with DRM, Always On APM, tiny maps, forced origin installation, lacking mod support, no steam support, and a forced multiplayer aspect.  I decided to not purchase the title, so it may have been a decent game, but 2 years later a team of 12 people created a game that does everything maxis insisted was utterly and totaly impossible.\n\nEverything the mod community did that kept Sim City 4 on the shelves in Wallmarts across America for an entire decade was ignored. Maxis (and to a lesser extent EA) ignored the fans, and gave the people who had kept them in business for twenty years a crippled subpar game.  And for that Maxis is now out of business. They will never make another game, and it is no one's fault but theirs.\n\nNow pretend none of that happened. It's 2013 again, and here it is people: Sim City 5.\n\nThe game balance is a bit on the easy side for veterans of the genre, but the potential map size is ENOURMOUS and customizing your city could fill up years of gameplay time.  The game runs so smoothly with so much going on, it really shows how lazy Maxis was with their approach.  The glass in buildings reflects the sun and the buildings near it, there are dynamic shadows, zoning is back, and it is not 'dumbed down'.  A single tile in this game is twice the size of the alloted map in Sim City, and you can purchase dozens of additional tiles to expand.  The map editor is awesome, the community is thriving, there are mods to do anything you want, and this is the city building game we've all been waiting for.  I can not possibly reccomend this more.","April 19, 2015","true","181.9"," 1,428 of 1,472 people (97%) found this review helpful 108 people found this review funny","97","428","1","108","8"

I couldn't let that happen, so I bulldozed every medical clinic and hospital and replaced them with cemetaries so the citizens knew exactly what their future looked like. While more and more people got sick, the population continued to decrease by the thousands. It took no more than fifteen minutes before every citizen was dead. Every citizen except for one.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/doc_rock2/recommended/255710/","doc_rock2","Doc Rock","http://steamcommunity.com/id/doc_rock2/","485 products in account","Cities Skylines Review\nIts been a long time since a really good City Builder has been on the market so every time there is a whisper of a new one being developed, fans of the genre like myself become eager with anticipation. Unfortunately, we have been left wanting for nearly a decade. Yes, its been that long since a really decent sim has been released. Upon learning that one of my favorite publishers, Paradox Interactive, had a City Building simulation in the works I knew this was a game I could not wait to get my hands on. Paradox Interactive is known for being a leader in challenging and entertaining  strategic games so I felt if anybody could do it right, they could. Having been able to test the game for almost a full week before its official release I can say that my trust was not misplaced. Cities Skylines is everything I hoped it would be. This is city building done right.\n\nI have played most every City Building game ever made and consider myself somewhat of an expert in the genre. Perhaps I am over-critical at times when it comes to my favorite gaming genre but it comes from the desire to find the Holy Grail in city sims. I can honestly say, Cities Skylines is far and above, the best city building simulation ever made. Period. Colossal Order has come up with a recipe that ingenuously combines just the right amount of simplistic game design with a flavorful amount of challenging gameplay to create a masterpiece. Fans of City Building simulations will definitely not want to miss grabbing this game.\n\nThere is a very realistic feel to this game. Its not just about throwing out color-coded building zones, but more about true city management. Do things right and your populus will be greatful and steadily grow. Do things poorly and your city will clear out faster than a zombie apocalypse could make it happen. Numerous tools are at your disposal as expected with an interesting dynamic that truly brings the realism into the game. Cities can be carved up into different districts and each district can have its own set of policies and characteristics. Players even choose the names. But it doesn't just stop there. Players can give custom names to just about everything in the game including its citizens.\n\nTransportation and pollution will be key challenges as with any game of this type. Having experience with previous endeavors like the Cities in Motion series, Colossal Order has easily found a way to challenge players along these lines. Cars and trains, ships and planes. Cities Skylines has it all. The water simulation is spectacular as well. Placing your sewage disposal upstream, for example, could result in contaminating your citizens' water supply. Realistic flooding is another possible scenario. The maps included are gigantic and beautifully designed terrains that offer endless possibilites when planning your city and continued population growth unlocks the ability to expand to adjacent tiles on the map as well as making more buildings and options available (such as taking out loans). These options are tied in with overall success and not just simply from having enough funds available, a feature which definitely enhances the experience.\n\nI could go on and on about all of the things I admire about this game. The graphics are solid but not overly done which allows for most systems to be able to run this game smoothly. The UI is easy to use and understand. The "Chirper" social media feature is a clever modern touch that keeps mayors abreast of public opinion and concerns. And, perhaps one of this game's best features is the inclusion of asset and map editting tools to allow the Steam Community to heavily mod this game in order to continue its growth and stability in the future while adding tons of extra content and replay value.\n\nIn fact, about the only area I found lacking in this game is not having a variety of random events such as natural disasters. I cannot say with certainty why the developers chose not to include them and perhaps they will be added later as DLC since most Paradox Interactive games are known to offer quality additional content long after initial releases. The modding community could possibly offer them as well, since I predict the Steam Workshop will quickly fill up with a large variety of added content. Fires, floods, pollution, infrastructure and transportation issues are still more than enough to keep players challenged and fully engaged though, so overall its not really a major concern.\n\nThe Good:\n========+  Solid graphics and rich detail\n+  Realistic simulation elements\n+  Challenging gameplay with various difficulty settings\n+  Variety of buildings\n+  Many customization options\n+  Easy-to-use UI\n+  Extremely high replay value\n+  Mod-friendly with editting tools included\n+  Steam Trading Cards & Achievements\n+  Pleasant audio/background music\n\n\nThe Bad:\n======-  Lack of random events/natural disasters\n-  Graphics could be more life-like\n-  Terrain cannot be changed during actual gameplay\n\nFinal Thoughts:\n===========Cities Skylines is the best City Building simulation developed in a long time and quite possibly the best ever. Expect this game to continue to grow in popularity and become the new industry standard for games of this type. An amazing game with well-designed features integrated into it for such a small development team and a limited budget.

I'm having trouble finding ANYthing wrong with this game. I've played most SimCity's, Anno 2070, Cities XL and almost fell for the Cities XXL nonsense. Then I found this game, and my life is complete.\n\nSome of the things worth noting:\n- The UI is simple but intuitive, it doesn't have that featureless feeling some of the plainer UI's have.\n- The game itself runs incredibly well, however you do need a good processor and a few GB of RAM to play it idealy.\n- Gameplay is silky smooth and addicting, no glitches or anything. There's even a little in-engine physics to things like cars, rivers and trees.\n- Road design is incredibly free and grid layouts are 100% accurate, unlike 2013's Simcity.\n- Full workshop and in-game modding support with an expanding community and many interesting items and maps to choose from, Copper Creek on the workshop is my favorite.\n- This list just goes on and on...\n\nThe only thing I can really notice being undesirable (to a small extent, it's not really a big deal) are things like garbage and deathcare. They tend to get overwhelming and lots of weekly money needs to be spent to fix them. (When your landfills are full or more people are dying than you can transport to a cemetary kind of thing) I'd recommend finding something better on the workshop or using the asset editor to lower/raise some gampleay values in those buildings slightly.\n\nJust a fair little heads up to newcomers, your citizens in this game are born, age, and die eventually. Don't worry though, they'll be replaced by their children for the largest part. But there may be a point in the game where a lot of people suddenly die and it's a little scary. This is because of your senior citizens getting a little too old. if you know what I mean. Be sure to prepare for this if you find it to happen, I am not completely certtain if it's just that playrhrough of mine of if it's actually a phenomenon within the game.   :P\n\nTo sum it up and make it nice and short for you, this game really is a worthwhile investment and it honestly, coming from someone who's a dear city-builder fan, steps on all the other titles and I mean ALL of them. You'll love it.\n\nFind my review helpful? Have anything to say or any constructive criticism to give? No problem!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/princecoo/recommended/255710/","princecoo","princecoo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/princecoo/","541 products in account","Cities: Skylines is a City Builder/Simulation game, and it’s fantastic.\nCities: Skylines absolutely destroys EA and Maxis’ 2013 effort, Sim City, in every conceivable way.  Where Maxis managed to somehow fail in a genre they pretty much invented, Colossal Games and Paradox Interactive have treated Maxis’ effort as a treatise on what not to do.\n\nThis is, without a doubt, the game Sim City 2013 should have been.\n\nFirst up, the graphics. Skylines is very well optimized, with large detailed cities bustling along with no hiccups, and some nice options in the settings to fiddle with if you do experience any problems. The game looks great, with lots of detail. Buildings grow and “level up” as you watch, changing their value and appearance and attracting different types of people and businesses. You can easily identify different areas and specialties, as well as transport, power and sewerage systems by colour using the (mostly) intuitive UI. Clicking on people, houses and buildings will give you more details, and identifying problems (or successes) is made very easy.\n\nThe gameplay is where Skylines shines, however. You’ll be juggling residents needs and wants by ensuring access to clean water, power, efficient transportation, entertainment and medicine, to name just a few. You’ll have to control pollution, both physical and noise, crime and disease. There are a variety of ways to do this, how you go about it is up to you.\n\nYou’ll start by placing roads. Then zone areas off the roads into a category: Residential, Industrial, Retail and Office. Then set up a functioning power grid and clean water/waste water sewerage system. After that, it’s all about placing public services to attract more people, and expanding your city across the map. And what a map! You initially start on each map with a 2 square kilometre parcel of land in which to build, but can expand out over 8 such parcels out of 25 available per map. That said, it is trivial to mod out the limitation, and if your computer can handle it, you absolutely can build on the entire map. As a bonus, if you don’t like any of the premade maps the game ships with, you can easily use the in-game map editor to create (or recreate!) your own map to play on. There is even an asset editor too, so you can create and modify the in game assets to your preferences.\n\nThe game systems make sense, and work how you’d expect them to. This is a simulation game, after all! After you’ve finished zoning your city, you can then create districts, which allow you to apply policies city wide or just to select areas. Make the CBD have compulsory smoke detectors and free public transport, while giving the poor and destitute section of town a rebate on green energy. Ban heavy vehicles from residential areas to lower noise and decongest traffic!\n\nIndustries will make you money, but require careful planning. Take advantage of natural oil reserves, mine ore, farm, cut down your forests or simply go for “Generic”, where you’ll be making random stuff. The finance and taxation system is easily understood and superb.\n\nThe game models traffic behaviour very well and in fact figuring out a way to manage high density traffic is one of the hardest aspects of playing Skylines. To that end, you’re given plenty of options, such as numerous road types, public transport, cargo ships, trains and aeroplanes.\n\nSurprisingly, the game has an incredibly effective water simulation too; Dams will burst and water flows realistically throughout the map, and pollution will be carried downstream with currents.\n\nThe icing on the cake for Cities: Skylines is the fact that Skylines is 100% mod friendly, with integrated Steam Workshop support. People have already uploaded thousands of custom maps and assets to the workshop, as well as gameplay tweaks and it’s pretty safe to say that if you find something wrong with the game that you think could be better, there is a very good chance that there is already a mod for it on the workshop.\n\nNow you’ve heard me gush over how great this game is, what are the cons?\n\nThe game doesn’t auto-save! This is a real pain if you mess up. But, there is a mod for that.\n\nThere is no day/night cycle, which would have been nice. But, there is a mod for that.\n\nThe camera doesn’t let me go low enough to get a good look of my city streets up close. But, there is a mod for that. There is another one that enables a First Person View from and person you click on in the street!\n\nNot a lot of maps to choose to play on. But, the workshop has hundreds available, downloaded and added to the available maps with a single click.\n\nThere is even a mod that allows you and a friend to explore your cities in First Person online, using the in game people as avatars. Why? Who knows! But it’s possible!\n\n\nIn conclusion, if you like city builders or simulation games, you cannot go wrong with Cities: Skylines. It is everything you could want out of this genre.\n\nSim City, eat your heart out.","April 24, 2015","true","74.8"," 458 of 475 people (96%) found this review helpful 38 people found this review funny","96","458","475","38","8"

A balance between looking good, and performing well. While not top of the line graphics, Skylines found a sweet medium between realism and cartoony that actually works rather well. It's not distracting in any way, and you wouldn't really notice until you zoomed in close to individual cars and people. The city feels alive and bustling, and the game still performs well at large simulation levels. The interface is very, very well thought out, along with each of the overlays. It is clear they are all heavily inspired by Sim City (the good ones), which isn't a bad thing. Why fix what isn't broke?     Gameplay  9.5  This is what city-builders have been waiting for, for a long time. Ever since Sim City 4, city building games have either performed poorly, or massively under-delivered gameplay wise. Skylines has come onto the field full force, and delivers a polished, seamless world to build in, with a gigantic area to boot. Manage your water lines, power, trash, health care, leisure, and more. Of particular note are the public transit routes, refined by the former Cities in Motion games. Also of mention is the small, but wonderful ability to create districts which allow you to section out portions of your city and assign each of them unique names and policies (no high-rises, less water use, etc). Skylines took plenty of notes from the old city builder games we all loved, and refined the experience into something absolutely wonderful. They've even included a mode to allow you to play with unlimited money, and everything unlocked, so you can build without worry and create the city you've always dreamed of! The only minor frustrations that have emerged are some struggles with boats and routes for roads, but that could be my lack of patience for getting down into the nitty-gritty details of layout.    Story  N/A  No story here, besides the one you mutter to yourself as you cut off your city's water supply.    Multiplayer  N/A  No multiplayer in Cities: Skylines.    Replayability  10  This nearly comes with the territory of city building games. They always call you back to try creating a different city, or try new ideas with your layout. Or perhaps unleash havoc on the city to just...see what happens. Take all that joy, polish it, and you have Cities: Skylines, at your beck and call.    Overall  9.6/10  If you have been waiting for a worthy successor to Sim City 4, you have just found it. With free content updates down the road, Steam Workshop support, and developer's that listen to their audience, Cities: Skylines has everything good going for it, and my does it sing its song well. From the refined interface, to the focus upon you having control over your city, to the sheer size of the cities you can create; Cities: Skylines delivers on every front, and is exactly the city-builder game you hoped it would be. Though it isn't revolutionary in any of its gameplay elements, it has risen to the challenge that was so long failed, and now carries the torch of the city-building genre. Highly recommended, now get out there and build the city you've always dreamed of, and be sure to stop by the Steam Workshop for some neat mods!\nIf you liked this review, feel free to check out my curator page:\nThe Tipster\n\nYou are also welcome to join our group and play/discuss games together, here:  The Tipster","March 12, 2015","true","26.1"," 659 of 703 people (94%) found this review helpful 57 people found this review funny","94","659","703","57","0"

It's the best in generations. BUT, like any other game, it has it's downfalls too.\n\n\nMAP SIZE: 10/10\nThe city size is HUGE. At first you start out in a 2kmx2km area, but you can expand to a total of 9 of them, for a 18x18km area or 324 km or 201 mi area. Another pluside is that there are already mods to expand your city size to a total of 25 tiles, for a 50x50 km area, 2500 km, or 1553 mi area. The size of this doesn't make your computer lag, either, unless you don't meet the minimum requirements for the game.\n\nAI: 7/10\nThey all have diverse personalities, and you can explore the lives of each of them. The only problem is the traffic. It's terrible: If there all 6 lanes available, they will all go in one lane. Genius.\n\nINTERFACE: 9/10\nThe interface is great. It is just a little cluttered.\n\nHOW IT RUNS: 10/10\nIt runs extremley smooth and only starts to lag when you have HUGE cities. For an example, watch this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVoP1Um95Sg&list=UUZYqx1ak0C-YKhUQY6QtxDQ\n\nTHINGS TO DO: 9/10\nThere is a LOT to do, from perfecting neighborhoods to fixing water pipes. The only reason I knocked 1 point off is because there are no disasters, which in my opinion is something required for a city building game.\n\nDIVERSITY: 9/10\nThe only reason it is 9/10 is because the building colors are almost identical and painted-looking. Despite this, you can model your own buildings :)\n\nDIFFICULTY: (not how hard the game is) 9/10\nThe only reason it is difficult is when you get to huge cities it becomes literally difficult with everything in your face all at once.\n\nGRAPHICS: (for the average graphics of the time of the release date) 9/10\nThey are amazing. I've seen better, but it is still great. It has it's own style.\n\nCLUTTER: 8/10\nUgh, when your in a city trying to build, pop ups everywhere makes it hard to work..\n\nPRICE: 10/10\nFor this great of a game, it is very cheap at the time of it's release.\n\nOVERALL SCORE:\n90% To Perfect\nWould I recommend this?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sonoralax/recommended/255710/","sonoralax","Sonora","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sonoralax/","456 products in account","For 2 weeks I debated purchasing Cities: Skylines (I'm sure I annoyed most of my friends by weighing the pros and cons with them!) Eventually I said, "screw it" and made the purchase: I have not regretted it since.\n\nIn a nut shell, Cities: Skylines is your basic city simulator. You start off with a blank landscape and a highway off to the side, of which is the key to growing your sprawling city. Sounds very simple, yes? Well, not quite. Cities: Skylines goes beyond just throwing houses and shops together. You're required to check pollutants in the form of ground and noise, dissiptating clogged roadways, providing entertainment, and so much more. Essentially, this game is everything that you could ever ask for in a simulator.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\nPros+ Replayability value is here 100%\n+ Sound effects are great and very life-like\n+ The graphics, my oh my, the graphics - they are absolutely stunning; if you're able to play on high graphics, then go for it. The view is very rewarding and satisfying. Great job, Colossal!\n+ There is always something to look out for: budgeting, job and housing demands, etc. This game is definitely no joke. It demands your every attention and is not something you can just idle\n+ Related to the graphics point: I love how this game works so well on my non-gaming laptop. I have a Toshiba E45T which is not one by any means. This game is so well optimised, I can still enjoy it to its fullest though\n+ The "basic" version of Cities: Skylines offers a lot at a decent price. If your budget is fairly tight, then disregard the Deluxe Edition unless you really want 5 extra monuments (plus as a way to support the developer's further). You can always get the 5 extra monuments through the workshop\n\nNeutral± DLC's are a bit pricey and I'm not sure if it's really worth it. In the end, it's your call\n\nUpdate 26 May, 2016: I've finally gotten around to purchasing both DLC's and I'll provide a brief breakdown.\n\nAfter Dark DLC: comes with some new lanes and a couple edicts, leisure and tourism specializations (night clubs, etc.), and extra buildings. Some people are noting that it comes with a night and day cycle, but I was experiencing the cycle without the DLC... maybe I'm just confusing something!\n\nSnowfall DLC: snow, obviously, hah! Also snowmaps, snowplows and snowpiles, more edicts and heating systems.\n\nVerdict: In my opinion, the DLC's are not worth it at their full price. Yes, they serve to enhance gameplay and also act as a way for you to support the developer's as well. With the little amount of content that both of them offer, however, and at $12+ price tags, I'd say your money would be better spent elsewhere. So, either wait until the DLC's are cheaper (I'd say under $8 would be more appropriate), avoid the DLC's completely, or just splurge because you want to. If you're an achievement hunter like me, then you'll need to purchase the DLC's.\n\nIf budget is an issue, then I would suggest getting After Dark first. It has been much more enjoyable due to it's far more superior offering of content. Quite frankly, I haven't even really played with Snowfall since it doesn't offer much beyond its name. It's completely up to you!\n\nCons- Realistic traffic please! (There is a mod for this though)\n- Can there be an undo button? It would be extremely helpful\n- Connecting roads can be a real hassle at times, especially when you're looking to upgrade them\n- Would be very useful if we could just upgrade buildings for a fee, such as the Cargo Harbour to Hub (without having to go through the process of destroying it first)\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\nAll in all, Cities: Skylines is honestly one of the best purchases I have ever made to date on Steam. I've already lost 22+ hours since my purchase 4 days ago, and it has left me impressed each time I've exited the game.

As a SimCity player since the 1989 original, I was chomping at the bit to get my hands on this thing. I’ve spent about 40 hours on it so far, so the question is: does it succeed in its goal of topping SimCity? Well, in a word, YES.\n\nAs is tradition, you start with a blank plot of land and a set of tools at your disposal. Generally the goal is to build a city, grow it as big as you like, and make sure it doesn’t die. You have a single highway connection to start out with, which acts as the first of many entrances to your city. Use the road tools to draw some roads, and you’ll see that you get groups of tiles extending from the side of them. These tiles can be filled with three types of zones: residential, commercial, and industrial, which will become homes, shops, and factories. Although more come into play later on, like high-density residential and commercial zones, as well as office zones, the central system of RCI demand is very much in play here. The more demand for a zone you have, the more people will move in to fill those zones and the more service buildings you'll require, so you’ll want to balance their placement with the other needs of the city. Beyond these basics, it’s totally up to you as to what’s next.\n\nAnd thankfully you’re not limited to your initial map size. That starting plot of land is 2 square kilometers, but once you start reaching its borders, you have the option to buy more, up to 36 square miles worth (more if you mod the game with the excellent tile mod on Steam.) Although, sometimes the game gets a bit bogged down in ambiguities regarding its logic, mostly regarding traffic, services, and lack of UI information. But once I started to figure these systems out, the challenge in fixing them was hugely rewarding. Cities XXL and SimCity 5 were entirely too easy, and if you screwed those cities up, that was a real feat of ineptitude. Here, a doomed city can arise from something as simple as building an intersection instead of a multi-lane traffic circle, and that’s kind of awesome. But it doesn't feel cheap, it feels like something to learn from and perform better next time. There are also some included mods from the developers, which act as cheats and difficulty settings in lieu of more traditional menu options. And on top of that there's an incredible potential for user-made mods, with a full blessing from the developer to do so with the included Steam Workshop support.\n\nLet me just say it: This is the game I’ve been craving since SimCity 4. My few complaints are just drops in a sea of truly satisfying gameplay. It’s the kind of game that I can play for so many hours at a time that when I leave, I start seeing zone layouts in my ceiling, and traffic patterns in my cereal. Just give me a pot of coffee and watch me while away dozens of hours creating the perfect balance of land value, city services, and mass transit systems and be completely content. It’s blissful, stressful, and compelling on a level that few games ever achieve for me anymore. There are so many details that I love, like the way you can paint zones with different brushes, the sweeping orchestral soundtrack, the guidelines that appear when placing roads, the fact you can flood your city if you dam a river improperly, the way any zone has buildings that fit into any plot shape, and on and on.\n\nAnd it runs great too, even when surpassing 100,000 citizens, it still played solidly with minimal frame rate issues on both my desktop and laptop. Colossal Order pulled off a true colossal order here: they made a better SimCity than Maxis could (requiescat in pace.) And all this with a comparatively small budget, a team of a dozen or so people, and the Unity Engine. Just... wow. Cities Skylines is a total slap in the face to SimCity 5, and man is it a beautiful thing to behold. And the price... you get twice the game at half the price of its rival's launch price. Folks, this is what I like to call “doing it right”. They could’ve charged double and I still would recommend it, but wow. This is a top-notch game at a bargain launch price, and it makes me want to cry tears of joy.","March 11, 2015","true","111.0"," 328 of 338 people (97%) found this review helpful 25 people found this review funny","97","328","338","25","5"

But the most annoying problem is it's traffic I guess. Sometimes, they prefer to go 1 lane than using all the lane that are available and caused the traffic jams.\n\nAnd also the death waves occur when you plot a big area of residential at once. http://imgur.com/gallery/5xz1CYa  What happen is they will die simultaneously as they have the same age and the hearse cannot pickup all the dead body at once and most of the citizen will abandon your city. So you need to build your city slowly and not plotting huge area of residential at once.\n\nOther than that, it is a good game and I really enjoyed playing this.

Even though there are no interactions between cities that are on different maps, it is frankly not necessary, with the help of the powerful yet easy to use building tool, you can build multiple cities on a single map.\n\nDespite its humongous size, the developers paid close attention to details, in fact, detail is the word I’ll use to describe this game. From the entire traffic network, down to individual citizens, every aspect in Cities: Skylines are properly simulated. You’ll find lorries, colour coded depending on what they are currently carrying, delivering their cargoes to their designated factories, citizen actually living in a permanent home, and ambulances rushing to accident scenes, then little paramedics will get out of their vehicle, and few seconds later return with a patient on a stretcher.\n\nI also love how water works in this game as well as the fluid physics, it is completely unnecessary to have it in a city builder but in this case it has added so much more to the experience. Water has currents and flows, so you'll want to pump water on the upstream and set up sewage pipes on the opposite end, else you’ll start pumping polluted sewage water back into the system. You can even drain a lake dry completely, or accidentally flooding your city because you demolished a dam, playing with water has never been so fun.\n\nThis is a city builder perfected, and with the support of Steam Workshop, further enriched by the endless creativity of the community. Cities: Skylines is a must buy for anyone who has the slightest interest in city builders.","January 3","true","8.9"," 400 of 434 people (92%) found this review helpful 25 people found this review funny","92","400","434","25","13"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/spiritreviews/recommended/255710/","spiritreviews","Spirit","http://steamcommunity.com/id/spiritreviews/","732 products in account","Full disclosure: review copy provided by developer/publisher!\n\nI come from a long, proud line of urban planners. My father is an urban planner, as was his father, and his father before him (his father's father's father copulated with goats and is seldom brought up in polite conversation). But the fast cars/money/women/goats lifestyle of urban planning never appealed to me. Much to my family's chagrin I pursued writing, and they were (and continue to be!) devastated. Before disowning me my father sat me down at the computer and urged me to play Cities: Skylines. “This is in your blood son,” he smiled, weary from a hard day of urban planning. “Please. For me. For the family.”\n\nSo I started to build my first city across from a scenic river... and, I don't know. I don't know how to explain it. It just clicked. I stretched roads in a grid and began zoning – visitors to my fair city would be greeted by our booming industry district, noisy and dirty and beautifully anarchistic; past the fuming towers they would admire our chic commercial district, busy with pedestrians and bathed in neon lights; further still they would find themselves in our residential district, with manicured lawns and parks and homes galore. But to build a city you have to do more than just plan. You have to create.\n\nI built powerful turbines to power my city and laid pipes for water to rush in and out. Satisfied I unpaused the game and watched. Slowly, skeletal structures emerged from the earth, supports were raised and lowered, and buildings became occupied. Little storefronts popped up, factories rose up, and dream homes were built. Cars flooded my little two lane streets, full of wide-eyed country bumpkins presumably. And things were good, for a time. I sat and watched my little citizens rush to and fro, traffic ebb and flow, and more buildings appear from empty lots.\n\nPerhaps my father had a point.\n\nOh, an achievement unlocked!\n\nBad Mayor. Have 15% Happiness.\n\n♥♥♥♥.\n\nI guess I wasn't paying close enough attention – wait, what do you mean “sewage is bubbling up?”\n\nAnd so my city, 420BlazeIt360NoScope, drowned in a sea of human waste. Langston Hughes, a dream deferred does indeed stink of rotten meat, for the record. It was also crusty.\n\nCities: Skylines is the sleekest, smartest, and most potentialicious city builder available currently – and may possibly remain so thanks to integrated, dedicated modding support. You'll start off in the vanilla game with a single tract of land and an off ramp. To get your city off the ground you'll do what I mentioned previously - sans massive sewage backup. You'll zone districts, set up the water and electricity, and watch your little hamlet bustle. As your population grows so will your abilities and responsibilities. You'll have to build accessible clinics, police stations, schools, and fire stations. You'll have to keep pollution (sound, ground, and water) in check. Districts lines will be drawn and policies enacted, like establishing an industrial sector in a particularly fertile area as a farming region, or banning smoking in a residential area. Prompts will flash if garbage is getting out of hand, buildings are abandoned, taxes are too high, etc. In addition Chirper, the game's Twitter feed thingy, will tweet pertinent (if sometimes repetitive and annoying) information.\n\nWith every addition and upgrade you'll have to expand further and further, balancing the budget, happiness, and health of your city along the way. Eventually you can purchase as many as nine map tiles, upgrading, rebuilding, rezoning, public transit, shipping... the scope of it is a little overwhelming (old hands at city building sims will find themselves in familiar territory and will likely have bustling metropolis' in no time. For the uninitiated I'd recommend watching the frequent Twitch streams and Youtube LPs)! Mastering C:S requires a great deal of foresight. Sure, you can build the cheap coal and oil power plants, but pollution will skyrocket and illness may spread. Build the more expensive green energy alternatives and you'll contend with noise pollution and have to choose more specific locations to place them. Traffic will begin to bottleneck on busier roads, and buildings out in the boonies will be more vulnerable to crime and fire (and fire crime, “arson” sounds much to pedestrian). When you have a breather, however, it's one of the most relaxing, satisfying games I've ever played. Watching your citizens go about their days is mesmerizing... people walk their dogs, firetrucks blare by, garbage trucks make their rounds. It feels alive.\n\nDespite some technical glitches (trains jumping tracks, cars driving into burning buildings, little oversights with no bearing that SHOULD be patched early into release), I don't really have any complaints. Yes, seasons and a night cycle would have been nice, more aesthetic “flavors” for buildings and locations would keep things fresh, and more “disasters” to deal with besides those created by player ineptitude would be fun to contend with (natural, human, seasonal, or just plain silly). While the vanilla game might get boring after twenty or thirty hours, there are already mods, new assets, and maps to spice things up. Just like a real city, a REAL community, this game's replayability will be dependent upon community involvement. And I predict a lot of brilliant mods and patches to come.\n\nThere's something really special about C:S and I can't quite put my finger on it. It's like waking up on DESIGNATED APPLICABLE HOLIDAY morning to a big present, and you unwrap it and it's one of those farm playsets, or when you're zooming toy cars along the roads of your city map rug, or admiring an elaborate diorama in a quiet museum.\n\nAnd then somewhere nearby a toilet explodes.","March 10, 2015","true","20.9"," 779 of 887 people (88%) found this review helpful 845 people found this review funny","88","779","887","845","25"

This is Pablo, from SimNation.\n\nCities: Skylines goes back to the core City Builder experience of SimCity 2000, 3000, 4... and improves on it.\n\nSimulation is epic. Each citizen is simulated, with own age, workplace, home, household, education level and happines. They can even own cars. And all of this is persistent. All of them are living in your city until the day they die out of sickness or when their time comes.\nTraffic and Public transportation is properly executed as well. Heck, even water is simulated with the Fluid simulation. I think we all have seen the dams and the poop flowing by a river at the expected speed and direction.\n\nThe economic system is awesome. RCI is meaningful. Commerces import goods from the exterior, or local industries if available. Citizens must purchase different kind of goods to be happy. And all of this is executed, and you can get down to street level and see it for yourself.\n\nBuilding a city on Cities: Skylines is this long, epic journey, where you will be laying out the city infrastructure through proper city planning and engineering (the game will punish you for not making road access or dispose your sewage properly), dealing with Noise Pollution, dead body collection, and all with the right level of micro management to make you feel you are in charge. From laying down the routes of buses or metros, to defining Districts and setting unique Policies to change the way it behaves, or help a sector get back on it's feet by lowering taxes or making public transportation free.\n\nDespite the lack of polishing of many aspects of the game, from user feedback, to user interface and lack of content variety (chirps, buildings, billboards), you are not going to focus too hard on it because of all the other things the game gets right.\n\nIf you like city builders, this is hands down a safe purchase. A game that will most likely be supported for years, with an insanely amount of Mods and great deal of free patches to come, which will hopefully fix those rough edges from day 1.","March 10, 2015","true","103.6"," 281 of 308 people (91%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","91","281","308","11","5"

Avoiding the mistakes made by EAs most recent Sim City release, Skylines does without an always online connection, supports large building areas and user created mods.\n\nAnd while avoiding these pitfalls, Collosal Order and Paradox have also made a very addictive and entertaining game.  You can easily lose hours making sure your bus routes are optimized and your fire departments can get to that shack down the road that keeps burning down.\n\nThe UI is clear and easy to navigate, building roads and designating zones for construction is simple, yet requires some careful planning if you want to make the "best" city possible. There are many tools and overlays available for viewing crime, water quality, power consumption, etc. Economy isn't overtly deep, simple sliders for taxes, and options for different policies.  For those wanting to go deeper, you can rename every citizen, vehicle, building, create districts, individually manage them, alter bus routes, and plenty more for the mayor that wants to really get down to street level.\n\nPlanning traffic routes is of prime importance in this game. Industry needs to move products, emergency services need to get to calls, and dead people need to be removed from their homes. More so than pretty much anything, you need to keep your eye on this. This isn't surprsing given the developer's history with Cities in Motion (despite being a Paradox game with a similiar name, this isn't part of the Cities XL series).\n\nGraphics look good for the genre (don't expect GTA V detailed cities), and everything is running smooth for me at a population of 45k as of this writing. The sounds are what you'd expect, nothing really stands out, and it's not annoying, fairly average.\n\nWhile the variety of options in the game is plenty, there are still some things I'm sure some people will miss from other city building games. No day or night cycle kind of spoiled my desire to see my city lit up at night. There could be a bit more variety in buildings, and public services (libraries, museums, prisons, zoos and some other notable buildings all appear to be absent). I'm sure modders will fill in this gap given some time, but I wouldn't mind paying for a hefty expansion if they decided to release more content in the future.\n\nPS:\n\nKill Chirpy.","March 15, 2015","true","27.3"," 176 of 182 people (97%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","97","176","182","12","6"

It is incredibly fun, insanely addictive and somewhat challenging, although it has some minor drawbacks.\n\nPros:\n+ It is so addictive I spent 36 hours playing it in the first three days after I got it\n+ Transportation system is very detailed, and agent-based simulation works very nicely with it\n+ Zoning works very nicely with free-form roads\n+ The available territory is quite big - up to 36 square kilometers in base game (9 tiles), up to 100 square kilometers with a simple mod (25 tiles) and whopping 324 (!) square kilometers with the less stable 81 tile enabler\n+ Unique and fully working fluid dynamics system\n+ Districts and policies allow for fine control over your city\n+ Globally unlocked buildings help to vary playstyle in different cities - from building an eco-friendly utopia with lots of parks and low taxes to an industrial hellhole full of illness and crime\n+ Modding is quite encouraged - the community is very active and the tools are easy to use; by now there are hundreds of great mods and assets avalable on the Workshop\n+ Dev team keeps in touch with the community and pays a lot of attention to the feedback\n+ Free patches significantly improve the game, introducing great features like tunnels, European themed buildings, day-night cycle, in-game terraforming, canals and quays, increased object limits and improved mod tools\n\nCons:\n- It's not very challenging past the first 10k - the biggest hurdles left are traffic and congestion (there are numerous mods rebalancing the game to be harder more realistic, but I can't vouch for their quality)\n- The amount of assets included in the base game is relatively small (but bigger than on release), so you'll see a lot of repetition (although it is remedied by mods and community-created assets, you have to keep an eye on RAM and VRAM consumption)\n- Day/night cycle doesn't really make much of a difference in vanilla gameplay (again, there's an excellent mod which overhauls the mechanic - Rush Hour)\n\nAll in all, Cities: Skylines is an amazing game that's certainly worth a purchase, especially with its low price. But you may not enjoy it as much if you are not a fan of the genre.","March 20, 2015","true","447.4"," 184 of 193 people (95%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","95","184","193","5","0"

A whole lot better when compared to the latest simcity which is plagued with many problems such as map size and DRM.\n\nPros:\n\n- Realistic water simulation; if you build your water intake down the river and the waste output up the river, you're gonna feed your citizens with poop water. And dams will alter the flow of the river\n\n- Noise pollution is taken into consideration (Can be caused by traffic, windmills, industries etc.).\n\n- District zoning (allows you to micro-manage your city easily). Policies can be introduced only to the specific districts. For example, in district 1 it is legal to use recreational drugs while in district 2 it is illegal.\n\n- Easily accesable info view where you can see the stats of your city, such as education, crimes, and so on.\n\n- Natural resource exploitation for more income.\n\n- Detailed public transportation systems which allows you to plan the routes.\n\n- Very easy to learn especially if you have played city building games such as Simcity before.\n\n- You are able to see the complaints of your citizens in a notification box above the screen which functions like twitter. This allows you to pinpoint and correct problems quickly.\n\n- Very big map sizes allows you to build metropolitan cities.\n\n- Limited service buildings are available at first but becomes available as your city grows (makes it easy for new players to learn)\n\nCons:\n\n- Road mapping can get wonky sometimes and you end up building roads that are slanted. This kinda irritate the OCD side of me.\n\n- The unavailability of service buildings early in the game means that it is harder to plan your city early on. And you might have to sacrifice a couple of houses to accomodate the buildings.\n\n\nI will continue to update my review as I put more hours into this game.

Also economic and human disasters would be awesome..i.e WWIII breaks out and the fights come to your city due to its important economic means and its military base\n\nElections and Council: Have a mode or option where you to put your record and city building skills on table and run against an opponent who may take your mayor position away. Also allow the option of adding a city council that can help or hamper your city planning by blocking or giving out city resources and land.\n\n\nMajor Company HQ's, Sporting Events/teams and world events: Let us negotiate deals with major companies to build hq's in the city which may require tearing down a popular city spot.

The game proven that it has done many thing right the first time its come out and exceeded what sim city was however there is more work needed for the game especially in terms of the end game content. Overall the game itself is an exceptional city builder that everyone has to play if you enjoy this genre.\n\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqfpr9MV00k&feature=youtu.be\n\n\nPros\n+ Runs really well and is decently optimized, even with a bigger city depending on your rig the game would still run really smooth (Window 7 64 bit from my end)\n\n+ The interface is straight from sim city so those with experience knows how to jump into the game with ease. Easy enough for new players to  understand and complex enough even for the hard edge veterans.\n\n+ The cities goes looks fantastic with modded material and district creation, the area changes on its look depending on what type of police you set in place.\n\n+ The traffic system, water, and power system all works in this game right from the start in the game creating less stress to the player( WOW!)\n\n+ The district systems lets you color out zones and implement polices for the game giving you the option to create bans on certain things such as pets or smoking ban and creating unique distrits throughout your city\n\n+ Easy to use tax system and system to use for\n\n+ Bigger map sizes for building. I had a Simcity complex where I would build in the small square a while taking up as much room as I can and being efficient as possible. It was easy enough to maintain a city and then expanding. Once expanding the city gets bigger and bigger and looks amazing.\n\n+Mod support on day one players are able to download others maps, building objects etc through steam workshop. The editor is also very easy to use and import/export material in to work with.\n\n\nCons (Or things that Cities Skyline needs to add)- The game lacks depth and challenge for end game content. I find the game is easy and even on hard mode( which I play on) it was pretty easy if one knows how to balance out efficiency and building his city.  In the end you will make a ton of money and just basically start plopping amazingly huge cities without a clear goal. There isn't any concept of material needs for the game to improve the lives of the people of the city (Which sim city had) to give it that extra depth.\n\n- The snap for placing road sometimes can be a bit wonky and needs a bit more work. There isn't a city preplanning tool to help you preplan and no rewind button. Once ya place it you delete it and replace it etc.\n\n- No dynamic day/night cycle and disasters. These two are important function because seeing your city glow in the night is simply amazing and having disasters give you a sort of thrill in when it does occur. Without it the game doesn't offer much of a challenge unless you mess up your electrical/water or one of the needs of necessity in which case you create a disaster from it.\n\n- The npcs are not that entertaining to watch since they do not adhere to a day and night cycle rule. Therefore they aren't as robust and dynamic if one actually follows them for a for a few.\n\n- No multiplay ( Don't know if this will ever come true in the future)\n\n- Blurry graphic at times at highest settings, turn down shift helps a bit and a bit of film grain is added to the game.","March 12, 2015","true","28.5"," 177 of 204 people (87%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","87","177","204","6","0"

Coming from early SimCity games and then to Cities XL, I can say that C:SL is a very, very recommended game that I will always recommend to any person interested in these games. I love city builders, and C:SL was amazing from the start. Many features include budget management, detailed transportation info, and many options on roads and how you want to build your city. You can expand your city limits and make your city thrive. With very little bugs and massive modding support, this game is the best of the best.\n\nCities After Dark has made it so much better, with activity in your city slowing down (which in turn makes your economy slow down at night, adding a new challenge to the game), as night progresses. Some parts in your districts can be set to accomidate night life to make even more money to compensate for the lost revenue. Taxi services, train lines, bus lines, and subways are options for public transportation. Water and electricity management are vital to survive as a municipality. I love Cities: Skylines!","September 24, 2015","true","156.8"," 117 of 126 people (93%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","93","117","126","6","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Deszcz/recommended/255710/","Deszcz","Obama-san","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Deszcz/","711 products in account","To me, this game has become the new modern standard citybuilding game. It's a game that feels like it is pushing the citybuilding game genre back to it's roots. Clearly the developers learned from the mistakes of Maxis and EA with SimCity; everywhere it failed to deliver, this game has got it. With a focus on things like Steam Workshop and modding it seems a thriving community will come of this game and clearly hasn't been made to become a DLC machine.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jnWhIaxgpM\n\n\nPros:\n\n> Wide audience appeal. It feels that it can be as casual or as serious as you want it to be. Not at all daunting for a first timer to use, and even includes things like hard mode for the more seasoned city builder.\n\n> The game feels very well optimised and runs very nicely. Both my laptop and desktop PC play this game very well.\n\n> Easy to use world and assets editors for deeper customisation. Asset creations such as parks, buildings, intersections, props and even trees. All uploadable and retrievable through Steam Workshop.\n\n> It has a very detailed simulation of city life. Features things like dynamic water that makes dams usable, or gives you the ability to poison the city water supply with poorly placed pumping stations and drain pipes. You can follow people, cars, buses etc and you can see these people are living out daily lives. The city does feel alive.\n\n> Huge expandable worlds to build in. No more cities the size of a village like on SimCity. You can actually build massive sized cities!\n\n> You also have freely controllable taxes, funding and policies not only at a city level but also at a district level that can change the feel and dynamic of the cities and the people that live in them. You have a twitter-esque system that gives reports on how people are feeling based on tweets they make about the city.\n\n> There's lots to do with the roads. Many different shapes and sizes, one-way systems, highways, dirt roads, pavements etc, and they can all be raised, curved or done freeform.\n\nCons:\n\n> No day or night cycle! It seems so many situations on the roadways (rush hours etc) can't be experienced, which makes the traffic feel a bit basic a lot of the time.\n\n> Whilst there is a lot to do with the roads, it's not always as accurate as I would like. It makes building more complex road systems a bit of a pain, and won't let you connect up roads and paths in a way you may want. I hope it gets an update soon to let us customise our roads even better.\n\n> I notice a lot of the same buildings appearing next to each other, like having a street with just the same burger bar a few times on it. More building variation and randomisation would be nice, but I imagine this could be solved with user-created content.\n\n> Some of the figures feel a bit off. The population figures always feel a bit low compared to what you may expect from the current state of your city.\n\nOverall it's a lovely feeling game and comparatively to other city builders to come out in recent years, this is definitely the pick of the bunch. It's well priced on launch compared to competitors, especially SimCity.","March 10, 2015","true","31.0"," 97 of 108 people (90%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","90","97","108","5","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/FreakOramaXD/recommended/255710/","FreakOramaXD","FreakOrama","http://steamcommunity.com/id/FreakOramaXD/","737 products in account","Cities Skylines is said to be a "modern take on the classic city simulation" and after playing around for many hours, it is on that path and it's the best we have of a new modern city building simulator, and it's the best we will probably have for a while.\n\nThis is, to an extent, the city building game we've been waiting for, at least the best one we're going to get that's is satisfying, not buggy, not overly restricting, but one that's made with care, that's free from tiny shackles, with freedom and space to have creativity built in it, and one that's design nicely, combined with support for community support.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHbfMpcvEuk\n\nThe look of the game is decently great, at least better looking that a rehashed game for the third time, but lowers than a heavily funded one. it's working, compared to other recent city builders, it has minimal bugs, runs smoothly, even hours after playing the game with a lot of structures being built. The restrictions on the game at its peek is minimal, exponentially smaller than a triple-A produced game of recent years, with the ability to remove all restrictions.\n\nThe gameplay is slick and smoother, with normal decent controls and a good UI, and an even more detailed view of finer data like the space need to build a structure alongside a road, a better resource and feedback view, and other new elements introduced like noise pollution with elements and tools at hand to counter it. The game uses a nice system of the industry type zoning, with placing them in specific types of land with resources, and then applying the type of work they do with the use of the district painting tool. Certainly a new way of production that I haven't seen before, and it's kind of nice and sort of makes some sense instead of having just one building produce one specific type in mass.\n\nThe transportation and traffic controls in the game is real and it packs a punch, as it was created by the same developers who made Cities In Motion 1 & 2, which was mainly focused and is specialized on the transportation systems. So if you don't have a nice road map for you city, you will probably have issues with other cervices doing their jobs and as a result having more issues to deal with, which is great.\n\nThe problems with the game consist of the game not teaching you well enough on how the systems work, but you I managed to learn almost everything to make a decently big city on my second playthrough. My first time playing the game was arguably created a horrible city, but my second playthrough was a lot nicer after having all the experience and knowledge I gained from my first go at it, and at this point it's fine tuning with my third time at creating a nice city. Not a problem, more of a nit picky thing, the monuments in the game where mediocre in it's scale and design, as I wasn't overwhelmed by it's looks or scale. Plus, the game doesn't have any sort of flying services, which left me heavily focusing on my structural groundwork immensely more so I don't screw up later on and damage my city.\n\nOverall Cities Skylines is a wonderful city builder that I and many others needed, from the glorious days of the past, to the disappointments of modern times concerning a nice city builder, SC brings joy and hope that we finally get to have in this genre, for the asking price and for what you get and what you will get later on with support for community support, this is a definite good purchase.\n\nShameless link[ksalue.com] to original post","March 10, 2015","true","42.1"," 138 of 167 people (83%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","83","138","167","8","0"

It took me some convincing before I would buy a game worth that much. After I've watched/read various reviews of the game, which were all positive, I finally decided that I'd buy the game, and I'm happy with the decision. As of posting this review I only have about 2 hours played, but I can tell already that I'm going to love this game and probably play many more hours. There are so many features in this game, from big things like creating individual districts that have their own policies, to small things like renaming the residents of your city.\n\nThe only visible flaw of this game to me, is the game's font. It's so small on my screen that it is almost unreadable. This problem is being experienced by many other players of the game aswell. As of now, that is my only problem with the game and I hope that it'll be fixed soon.\n\nI definitely recommend this game to anyone who likes the City Builder genre.

I have some tenure with three different SimCity games and it usually amounts to moneyflow being non-existent, and I just get frustrated and nuke the town with UFO's, Tornadoes, and Volcanoes. It was great fun for when I was younger, but now at my age I demand something more satisfying.\n\nCities: Skylines delivers. With a modicum of patience, starting relatively small, I am actually capable of creating a city that functions.\nGranted I have a few issues, usually with traffic and land value. (My games I can’t usually afford to throw decent parks on every corner to make everyone happy). Regardless, my values tend to be over 70% in most cases and I call that a victory for my usual tenure in City-Sim games.\n\nThat's not to say how much FUN I'm having with the game. There's just something so satisfying about seeing all those plots of zoning evolve into buildings, and in turn watching those buildings evolve on their own as they get better educated, higher land values, and more customers. I want to see them succeed because I want to see what they look like next!\n\nThe workshop helps in this endeavor. One of my earlier complaints was that, after a few hours, building after building looked a bit same-y. The workshop introduces entire collections of buildings and downloading a few helps with variety and it's lovely to see.\nUsing mods locks the ability to earn achievements. Practical, due to the infinite money mod available in the base game. However it's annoying in practice since I am treating this game like a sandbox and a toy, so I activate a few mods and then just let the fun fly.\nThankfully the fun factor outweighs my need for achievements.\n\nUltimately, it's one of the first Sim games I've been able to succeed at. It's taking me away from some of my other duties on MMO's and the like, and considering playing one MMO is like having a part time job in its own right, this is quite the accomplishment for a quaint 30$ game.","March 28, 2015","true","39.9"," 75 of 85 people (88%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","88","75","85","5","0"

No need to call it a spiritual successor or anything, this game apes Sim City in every way as far as I can tell. I recall faint memories of attempting to play Sim City 2000 back when I was a little kid but the interface and gameplay was far too complex for me. I had more fun loading up the pre-set savegames of a sprawling metropolis and destroying it with robots or aliens and whatnot. I don't even really have any experience with any city simulators. However, this game does a modern Sim City better than any other game has done in recent memory.\n\nI don't have much experience with any city simulators. Now, I'm certifiably addicted to this game. The interface is stellar, the music charming. The sound effects are invigorating. The little dings as buildings level up fill my heart with happiness. The way your tiny ant-like populace pours out of your metro system after arrival is satisfying, as you know they're not using congestion-inducing personal vehicles. The ability to "paint" different zones, whether residential, commerical, or industrial is so delightful it's difficult to describe. Watching little buildings pop up, filling with residents populating the area is incredible to behold. You can even name every single object in the game, whether it be a building, a citizen, or even some random cougar roaming in the countryside. I took it upon myself to name every High School I built after any American presidents i can think of.\n\nI never thought this would happen, but as of 3/16/15 Cities: Skylines is my GOTY of 2015. It's been quite some time when a video game can suck away my time as well as this one. There's always more land to develop, more resources to export, more ways to attempt to fix your horribly congested traffic ♥♥♥♥ups. While the game doesn't do a perfect simulation, as the AI drivers refuse to take up multiple lanes in some instances, the amount of detail is incredible. Everyone wants to go somewhere, and all the cars are traveling with a purpose. It is important to make sure all the needs of your city are met, whether it be water, waste, dead people, sick people, schooling, fires, it really becomes overwhelming really quick. In fact, most of your first attempts at this game will create perpetual hellholes of civilization, tall gloomy buildings stuffed with stinking dead bodies and backed up sewage. However, in my opinion this does only galvanizes you to make your city better, by redirecting traffic and building public transports to lessen the load on commuter roads. Who knew city planning could be so fun?\n\nCities: Skylines isn't perfect, as evidenced by the traffic stingy AI and sometimes confusing circumstances where pressing criteria around the city aren't clear. There aren't any disasters that can hurt your city (other than accidental flooding from a Hydroelectric Dam). However, as seen by the ridiculous amount of mods that have hit the steam workshop a mere few days after release, this may be remedied. You can even create your own landscape using the map editors, and I dread to see what messing around with that will do my free time in the future.\n\nIf you have any interest in city simulations at all, you need to get this game now. Probably the best one to come out in a long, long time.","March 16, 2015","true","52.1"," 65 of 71 people (92%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","92","65","71","5","1"

But I can assure you, you can stop reading reviews for this game and buy it right now (or as soon as you can). Simply put, this is the best city-builder released for more than 12 years, since SimCity 4. Half the price as SimCity 2013 but with many more features, this game is easily worth the $30 price tag. Perhaps even buy the deluxe edition for the extra $10; the developers deserve it (the game was made by a team of about ten people).\n\nSo stop reading this review and buy the game.\n\nFor those still unsure about their purchase of this game, I'll now list some of my favorite parts, many of which SimCity 2013 and other city-builders lacked.\n\n1.) One-way-roads and roundabouts\n2.) Water physics: water pumps, sewage drains, treatment plants, and dams influence water levels\n3.) Parked cars. Doesn't seem like this should be a new feature in city-builders, but it is. Cars park on the side of the road and in parking spots.\n4.) Districts and policies: paint districts on certain parts of your city to keep track of things better and issue local policies.\n5.) Mods galore. The workshop is filled with various mods and the game has an asset and map editor built in.\nHopefully that small list of a few of my favorite things has convinced you to buy the game. Cities: Skylines will undoubtedly reshape the city-building genre, and will continue to do so for years to come, as the devs have promised extended support to as much as ten years.\n\nUPDATED Sept 24th, 2015:\nFor the DLC haters out there, this game will have plenty of DLC during it's long run. However, they'll be cheap (the one just released, After Dark, is only15 USD) and add actually new things that matter. Releasing along side every DLC is a patch that adds plenty of new features for people who don't buy the DLC (in the case of After Dark, non-DLC people will still get the day-night cycle among other things for free).","March 14, 2015","true","127.2"," 55 of 57 people (96%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","96","55","57","4","0"

This is an exceptionally outstanding citybuilder game, in a genre that for too long, has been deeply troubled with over-casualization, poor optimization, ill-thought out concepts, microtransactions, and general publisher shenangans.\n\nHighs:\n\n* Excellent Performance. I find that my city runs extremely well on my laptop even as it grows. I have not really noticed any dips in performance. The game seamlessly transitions between following an entity, and zooming out to broadly appreciate my traffic network.\n\n* Intuitive game mechanics. I was able to jump straight in and make assumptions about mechanics that made sense, and those were reflected in the game. As an example, I assumed people would use a variety of methods to get to work (hop on the metro, then take a bus), When I tracked people, they would do this.\n\n* Full Simulation. Things just make sense, you build a dam - the water level raises. People go to the store. People go to work. The water gets dirty from pollution. I get a sense that the city is a living and breathing entity - it gives me context to the experience.\n\n* Free, Focused Construction. You place roads and zones freely, focused around the placement of the roads. The zones are indelibly linked to this. It was a great design decision and simplifies the more annoying aspects of construction. It also makes the transport very obvious as one of the key aspects of the game.\n\nLows:\n\n* The listed city population seems much lower than it should be. My city looks like it should be about 100,000 people, but the listed population is only 30,000.\n\n* Not enough snapping options. This makes it really hard to make your own cloverleaf in highways if you are particulary OCD about this kind of thing, it's almost impossible to make angles of a similar basis repeatedly.\n\n* The Metro + Bus placement lacks feedback and is difficult to expand once done. I feel that you are really fairly blindly approaching this, at least at the start. Over time I might grow to understand this more. Also the numbers don't often line up well. My metro station might say "100 per week" but in the overall transport graph only 20 people are said to be using the metro.\n\nVerdict:\n\nIf you like citybuilders, buy this game. Not since SimCity 4 Rush Hour have I enjoyed an experience this much. I find it hard to suggest major ways to improve the concept. I strongly dislike casual approaches to the genre, and this is not one of those.

There's no bullcrap always online, you can expand your borders quite far - and they all merge into one map so you don't have a loadingscreen while switching between them. There is also support for a modding community to add to the game.\n\nBuilding a stunning metropolis spanning a huge area is both easy - perhaps a bit too easy, but I expect patches and mods will add some more challenge - and a lot of fun!\n\nIt's simply everything SimCity should have been, and more.\n\nGameplay: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aecMX3s5Eok","March 10, 2015","true","10.5"," 86 of 104 people (83%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","83","86","104","4","1"

I always wanted to build a big city, manage it and what is most important feel that the city is alive. And this game delivers.\n\nAs in every game you start with nothing. You start building roads and zoning and people starting to move in. They require electricity, water and other services. After you provide people with everything they need the buildings start to level up and grow.  Step by step your little city becomes more beautiful with every year. After a while your city is full of skyscrapers and is busy 24/7. With the „After dark“ update you got the night/day cycles and it looks amazing. You just look at your city every night, it‘s so beautiful. Also you as a mayor can manage your city. Apply various policies to districts, like ban smoking, encourage biking or ban heavy traffic just to name a few. You can set the taxes for your residents and business and set the budgets of city services like garbage collection, electricity, water, public transport and a few dozen more.\n\nPeople in this game are not just pixels moving in random directions. Every person has a name, home and a job. He goes from his home to a job to a commercial district and back home. Every resident is simulated individually. Similar to Tropico series, but Cities skylines has much more to simulate.\n\nOf course like every game this one is no exception and has some flaws.\nThe traffic is the most annoying. You will spend a lot of time managing the traffic, building and rebuilding roads. The previous game these developers have done is called Cities in motion and we can see it influenced Cities skylines, because required attention to traffic is a little too much. AI cars are stupid and don‘t know how to use lanes thus causing congestions. Of course every city has congestion problems and stupid drivers exists in real life too. So maybe it‘s not that bad, but anyway it could be better. Some mods can improve the traffic, but they don‘t change much.\n\nThe game lacks in management aspect. Yes you can manage your city but it lacks depth. It is too simple. I would like to have poor districts with bad education levels, where crime rate is high and police officers get shot often and you could apply some stricter policies over there or just leave them be in anarchy.\n\nGraphics in Cities skylines can be very beautiful, especially at night. Sometimes colors are off a bit, but all in all the game looks amazing. But this comes with a price. I get 25-30fps with GTX970 wich is not acceptable, but because it‘s not an action game i can live with that. I could lower some settings but i want my city look good, it‘s not an action game so it‘s playable at 30fps.\nDevelopers support modding very much, the game has steam workshop full of mods. I doubt anyone is playing this game without mods. You can download cars, planes, trains, buildings etc. to beautify and diversify your city. Also there‘s color corrections, some gameplay improvement mods and many more.\n\nIf you like city building and management games this is a must have. And considering the price it‘s worth it even without a sale, you‘ll get hours of playtime from it. Do not expect much on economic side, but all the city building is done almost perfectly.\n\nPros:\n\nLets you build big cities\nLooks gorgeos\nBuilding themes lets you build a different looking city every time\nMod support\n\nCons:\n\nLacks depth in managing\nDumb AI causing traffic problems\nPerformance\n","February 26","true","43.1"," 60 of 65 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","60","65","2","1"

I have played a lot of city sims in my day (Simcity, Tropico, CitiesXL, etc) and I can say this is the best I have played. While the game may be hard to wrap your head around at first (the game does a poor job introducing you, and there doesn't seem to be any real tutorial) once you start learning how to create your districts, city blocks, highway systems, services, mass transit, etc. the game really starts to take off in sheer size and scope. The maps are huge and could easily take you weeks to fill out with a single city. It's a far cry from the tiny 'districts' from the latest Simcity. The mechanics, such as placing buildings and infrastructure, are intuitive and easy to use for the most part (the transit lines could use a bit of work), and rarely did I have to wonder "why can't I place this here" or "why isn't this working?". The amount of in-game content for your city is also quite robust, and the ability to download additional content via the workshop lets you add even more.\n\nThis is a rock solid city builder that any fan of city sims or simulation games in general needs to own.\n9/10","May 27","true","36.3"," 63 of 70 people (90%) found this review helpful 28 people found this review funny","90","63","70","28","0"

She was a golden retriever named Sparkey and she was the best damn dog a kid could ever have. Was she perfect? No. She would seek out and consume cat poop and begged at the table when we tried to have dinner, but I didn't care. She was an awesome dog and I spent hours playing with her.\n\nNear the end of her life, her liver shut down. She started to ♥♥♥♥ and puke in the house, and even started to snap at me; she was in a lot of pain. In the end the vet suggested we put her down. It was a sad day. I had lost a best friend that I had for years, but it was for the best.\n\nLater we got a new dog. A Yellow Lab/German Shepard mix named Milo. Milo was not Sparky, but he is still an awesome dog. Playful, good with kids, cutely vocal and a big lump who's good for hugging. He isn't perfect either, he sheds like crazy, but that doesn't make him a bad dog.\n\nWhy did I ramble on about dogs?\n\nThe Sim City Franchise is Sparkey, with 5imCity 2013 being her post liver-failure. A game series I remember fondly as the stuff of my childhood, willfully editing out what happened at the very end.\n\nCities: Skylines is Milo. A new dog, a different dog, but an awesome dog.\n\nIf you are a fan of city building games at all, you are going to want to pick this game up right now. It is only $30 AT LAUNCH. That is not a sale price, that is the full undiscounted price and it is worth double that (which, by the way, is what 5imCity 2013 cost at launch). It is stable and fun out of the box and with adamant mod support and a dev team that is actively listening to the community feedback, it will get even better.\n\n","March 10, 2015","true","183.1"," 206 of 286 people (72%) found this review helpful 104 people found this review funny","72","206","286","104","14"

Warm colors.\nGame is easy to start and if you don't mess up completely in the beginning getting your city up and running shouldn't be an issue. Has hard mode where things are more expensive and you can also start with unlimited money if you just want to build.\n\nBig area where you can spread out your fledgling little town and thanks to mod support you can have even more space where to build.\nYou can also make your own assets or download ready ones from Workshop and plenty of different mods are available too. From traffic management to automatically bulldozing abandoned and burned buildings.\n\nDealing with the traffic can be a pain in the posterior sometimes in this game and you should be prepared to deal with it. Enough jams and nothing works. Fire engines get stuck in traffic and fires start burning your place down.\n\nThere is no disaster system in game currently if that's something you miss and need from Sim City titles.\n\nGame runs okay, with larger cities it might start slowing down a bit. Every citizen is simulated where they are coming and going and it takes it toll when you have large enough population.\nIf you're planning on unlocking all the buildable area with mods and your computer isn't quite up to date it's something to keep in mind.\n\nThere are occasional bugs here and there like ships roaming the country side if you do certain things and traffic not using all the available lanes on a road.\n\nDoesn't have always online requirement but you can't build multiple cities and have them work together either.","April 3, 2015","true","113.4"," 56 of 60 people (93%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","93","56","60","6","0"

You can design almost every detail including appearance of buildings, parks and other stuff, but it is only for the most fanatic players. General player population (Inc. Myself) will get with projecting town streets where the game also gives you a huge opportunity to be creative by designing every angle, every corner of the streets and planning where will be commercial, residential and industrial zones as we know it from the old Simcity franchise. You have to care about your citizens to make city prosperous, build hospitals, police offices, fire stations, cemeteries, public transport systems, roads etc. and enable easy access to these facilities.  If you do it right there won't be problems with traffic jams and that's the biggest obstacle not only in every simulator of this type, but also in real life.\n\nSo the Cities: Skylines has everything it should, but it also has another assets to offer: unlocking buildings like Hadron Collider or Fusion power plant and many more can get your attention and believe me achieving those is a long way. One of the most interesting things are districts and policies. You can divide your city into smaller districts applying another policies in different parts. For example you can lower taxes in newly developing areas to grab attection of investors or ban smoking and demand smoke detectors in industrial areas to prevent them from fire threat and many more. I really appreciated land value index by which you can deduce how different city parts are doing.\n\nThe game can entertrain you for hours and it's really fun, but there are some imperfections I have to criticize. The most significant is  once you get from the first struggles of a newly developing town, after making the first profits the game seems to me too easy, I'd appreciate some random events, all i care after that is traffic and that's what can be really annoying after a while.\n\n7.5 /10","June 6, 2015","true","35.5"," 51 of 54 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","51","54","0","4"

It is an actual city building game (which doesn't require an internet connection btw) that has pretty much everything I liked about the older games in it, but it also adds in a few fresh mechanics that keep things interesting. The traffic patterning, the modeling of pollution, and the electrical grid I find to be vast improvements over older games mechanically, and I love the water effects as well(I spent a good 5 minutes watching a dam fill up. It was mesmerizing) The only thing that I can gripe about if I get really nitpicky is that you have to plan transit routes and I would like more transport options. However, those could be easily rectified with a mod similar to NAM for simcity 4, and this game is designed to be easily moddable. Other than that, it's a very stable game which isn't terribly resource intensive for your PC. 10/10 would inadvertantly flood the highway leading into town with a dam again.","March 12, 2015","true","179.0"," 53 of 58 people (91%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","91","53","58","17","0"

Each starting city part is already bigger than tiny SimCity maps and you can buy adjacent lands to make it x9 times bigger still.\n\n- Smarter traffic controls. Though there are some issues with cars disappearing or turning in the middle of the road or going through each other - at least routing works. You don't have to wait hours for an ambulance or fire truck to reach its point, garbage gets collected, resources get sold.\n\n- Paint and fill tools for zoning (finally!).\n\n- Road connections can be edited. You are not restricted to just one entry point.\n\n- Pipes and power lines are back.\n\n- Can move buildings to another spot for a fee.\n\n- Fluid mechanics when placing an electric dam.\n\n- Overall better UI, city info panels and responsiveness (no fudged data like in SimCity - the number of workers and residents adds up).\n\nCons:\n\n- Plopping/building snapping. Unfortunately they added the same damn thing as in SimCity and restricted placing buildings only near roads. This results in a lot of wasted space between road connections and in small spaces. It cannot be switched off either.\n\n- No tutorial whatsoever and the hint system doesn't cover everything. Took me a while to realize that my elderly population doesn't work and i have to constantly build new houses like in Banished.\n\n- No landscaping tools.\n\n- Not enough parks. Most of them are huge so there is really no way to make beautiful city centres unless you are building in squares.\n\n- Weather and time of day do not change.\n\n- Zoning and placing roads is often a chore since they rarely snap at proper angles... again unless you build in squares.\n\n- Annoying sounds and twitteresque replacement of the "news ticker" from SimCity.\n\n- Biased approach to power plants - they are basically forcing you to be eco friendly since wind turbines are cheaper and more efficient than everything else. This is very unrealistic and unfair in my opinion.\n\n- Can't view overlays and build at the same time. Huge oversight since you need to know where to zone industrial for ore and farm placement.\n\n- All of the public transportation lines look the same, got same colour (all of the bus lines are the same colour and all of the metro lines too) and are generally hard to create and distinguish.\n\n- Lack of building upgrades. This probably was the only good idea from SimCity that should've been copied here.\n\nOverall there are quite a few annoyances and issues at the moment but all of them are compensated by the fact that this game is actually fun and doesn't feel like a couped up  tiny sandbox like SimCity.\n\nIts definitely better than CitiesXL as well, since it performs and runs smoother, uses more than 1 core, does not appear to have memory leaks and feels generally better made. The only issue i've encountered so far is some sound stuttering.\n\nSo i can recommend this if you like city building games and were disappointed by every other game in the last few years.","March 11, 2015","true","38.6"," 55 of 62 people (89%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","89","55","62","2","3"

I always been a big fan och city builders and was a little worried that this one would not live up to my expectations, like some other games in the genre....\n\nBut boy this one delivers more then I could ever hope for, it's only been out for a few days and it feels extremely well polished and the amount of effort put into the small details is amazing. Probably a quarter of the time I spent in my cities have been just enjoying how it looks and following the citizens around doing what they do. The agent system the citizens are based around works quite good and basically everything can be renamed, from people to buildings.\n\nIt is also possible to zone different regions in the city and give them individual focuses and different policies wich is an amazing feature that does alot for the immersion, and I would imagine could be awesome for those that likes to recreate irl cities.\n\nThe tools the game has available for creating roads is really solid to, personally I love to create spaghetti junctions and overly complicated networks that barely work and then try to fix them up. The traffic simulator is working and it feels like it responds to changes in the network quite well. Public transport for the game I have mixed feelings about, you have to manually create lines for busses, trains etc using a similar but less complicated system from Cities in Motion. This has the potential to be something really good but at the same a tedious task, and it makes me wish there were more tools to track groups of citizens travelling paths.\n\nI haven't played around with mods and custom assets yet but the built in features seems to be really good and the steam workshop integration allows easy access to other peoples creations, some amazing mods for this is bound to happen.\n\nI could write alot more about this but I don't have time...

It was mind-blowing.\nIn fact it was a concept that rocked so hard that the Los Angeles based Guns N Roses\n(the "One Direction" of the late 80's*)\nreleased a song to celebrate its greatness called Paradise City.*\n\n(*These facts may be erroneous and are awaiting citation.)\n\n\nUp All Night\n\nSo now we've witnessed the city building "big bang" we need to get out of here before the Libyans find us.\n\nIt's time to go back, not to the future, well to the future of the past, but not the future of the present!  (I love time travel!)\n\nIt's 2011, One Direction have just released their first album (One Direction rose to popularity to fill the gap in the time line left by Guns N Roses who may or may not have gone missing during the alien attack on Los Angeles in 2010 as depicted in the documentary "Battle Los Angeles" **)\n\n(** Almost certainly true but citation is pending.)\n\n\nBus Replacement Service\n\nAnother important event of this time period was the release of "Cities in Motion".\n\nAn excellent little  transport simulation game by Colossal Order which had you placing bus stops and metro stations across little city maps then sitting back and watching the ensuing commuter nightmare as your ineffective planning came to light.\n\nMy own gaming limitations aside, this was a gem of a game and left me wishing that I could manage the city development around the transportation network I was building.\n\n\nThe Ice Queen Cometh...\n\nIt's back up to 88mph again, a flash of light later and we're in 2013.\n\nThe Monstrous  Sea Creatures emerging from the "Pacific Rim" have failed to take out "One Direction" and in a desperate attempt to free our airwaves from the ironically titled "Best Song Ever" Disney released a counter attack by way of Princess Elsa begging these Guns N Roses replacements to "Let It Go" ***\n\n*** This information may be slightly inaccurate as I fell asleep during Pacific Rim and went outside to "build a snowman" shortly after Frozen started.\n\n\nIt Grows if you Play with it.\n\nThe other big news of 2013 was the release of Cities in Motion 2. The BIGGER is BETTER sequel to the previous transportation sim. It was prettier, the maps were much larger and your transportation decisions would impact city growth.\n\nWhilst still only a transport sim and not a city builder this was another great game in the franchise.\n\n\n1,2,3,4.....errr...1\n\nThe other, other big news of 2013 was the release of SimCity.\n\nYes I know we started our time travelling journey witnessing the birth of SimCity back in 1989, but it seems that,  despite spawning 3 sequels over the interceding years, a meeting was held by shady men of power where they discussed what they could possibly call the next game in the SimCity Franchise.\n\nThey'd already had SimCity, SimCity 2000, SimCity 3000, SimCity 4 (I assume they'd dropped the three zeros because they thought their audience incapable of counting up in 1000 increments any further.....)  so they came up with SimCity 5.\n\nI speculate that It was at this point one of them decided that the One Direction haggled minds of the current generation could not be expected to count all the way to 5.... so they decided to drop the number off the game title all together and SimCity was reborn!\n\n\nSham City\n\nAnd what a rebirth it was, not since Elsa had taken off her gloves and started freezing everything she touched like a frigid version of Gold Finger had such outrage been  seen.\n\nYou had to be online all the time to play the game,  their servers were overloaded so you often couldn't play at all! (both of these issues were fixed later)  but most importantly, the maps were tiny, tiny things with very little room for the one thing this game was supposed to be about, City Building.\n\n\nOn The Road Again\n\nIt's time to charge the flux capacitor one last time, we're going home!\n\nIt's 2015, Not content with their domination of the airwaves, One Direction are on tour.\nA public warning has been issued labelled  "On the Road Again"\n\nThe announcement includes the groups  whereabouts and an anticipated timeline to allow the general public to avoid several high risk locations, which are often large venues where people would normally gather, despicable.\n\nAnyway,  the Bigger news of 2015 is that the city builder is back!\n\n\nCity Building Games are like Buses.\n\nYou wait for years for one to come along and then two arrive at the same time.\nFirstly we've had the release of Cities XXL, a competent  city builder in its own right, but much like many of One Directions songs, it's almost an  exact copy of what came before it.\nThis hasn't gone down well with people already exposed to that particular franchise, if you've heard one song, you've heard them all, right?\n\nAnd now we have Cities Skylines, but is this the salvation of the city building genre we've all been hoping for ?\n\n\nA Little Misunderstanding\n\nWhen I first fired up Cities Skylines I was immediately filled with disappointment.\nIt was pretty, it seemed to have all the features I could want in a city builder, but the map size was tiny, SimCity 5000 tiny.\n\nThe same white dotted line marked out the edges of the postage stamp sized buildable area as I'd butted against in SimCity so many times before.... but I was wrong!\n\n\nGame Changer\n\nYou can't imagine my relief when I realised I could purchase new plots of land to expand my fledgling  metropolis.\nThe map is in fact huge, you can buy and unlock land to expand out not only in "One Direction" but in which ever direction you choose!\n\nI swear I've never felt such relief when playing a game before.\n\nIt was like finding out that Guns N Roses hadn't really been taken down by aliens, It wasn't only an amazing discovery, it was a game changer!\n\n\nCities In Motion\n\nAs you would expect from a developer who's previous titles have been transportation management sims, the transportation mechanics in Skylines are excellent.\n\nYou can place bus stops, set up bus routes, implement a tube system, play with trains and even boats. The public transport system is so fully realised and well implemented I really can't fault it.\n\n\nCities In Motion Too\n\nRoads aren't neglected either.\n\nThere's plenty of choice between different road sizes, one way systems, Yes, you can set streets up so cars can only go in "One Direction" (Best Pun Ever*) , roundabouts etc. All there waiting to help solve your traffic problems by way of substituting them with the problems of noise pollution instead.\n\n(*Best Pun Ever, may have been the  hidden bonus track released by the unexplainably popular boy band - reports are unconfirmed but it does seem to relate to the noise pollution issue).\n\n\n<snip>\n\n( To view the full review (and others) please take the time to visit http://www.review-well.com/  )","March 13, 2015","true","110.9"," 57 of 73 people (78%) found this review helpful 43 people found this review funny","78","57","73","43","0"

Doing this gives me insight into how I can make my city a better place for that citizen to live in...whether it's improving the transit system, putting in some commercial zones closer to their house, etc.  Being able to see real citizens going about their day to day tasks from cradle to grave is amazing.\n\nI bought this game based on the early positive reviews I read, and I have nothing but praise to add to them.

I remember playing Sims City 4 Deluxe Edition and thinking of how good it was, this game may have surpassed it's greatness. This game released a little over two years after the disaster that was Sims City 5. Picture everything wrong with that game, then think of the exact opposite and you have Cities: Skylines.\n\nPros\n- Very good graphics.\n- The little details (building signs, people biking, store fronts, etc).\n- Few repetitive buildings in close proximity, looks more realistic.\n- The traffic system (yes, it has some positives but I'll address the negatives in the cons below).\n- Day/Night cycle, it almost seems to change the whole look of your city.\n- Well optimized.\n- Frequent updates and patches.\n- Water physics.\n\nCons\n- Traffic will stay in one lane even if it is a 6 lane highway. What is the point of having different road types if your citizens use one lane? It is not a deal breaker for this game, but it does pull you out of the fantastic city environment Paradox Interactive worked so hard to make.\n- Maybe 2-3 crashes within my small time played. It's not really an issue but I thought I would list it.\n\nMy Verdict: 7/10 (If the issues with the traffic are fixed it is easily a 8/10)","November 30, 2015","true","11.7"," 34 of 39 people (87%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","87","34","39","3","3"

But the speciality of areas to section into your city seem lacking. However my biggest issue is no shock here. Taxis. I thought the taxis would work like buses jut spawning the needed amount for the area or route. Nope Taxis are a limited number. Making them nothing but flash for your roads and never making the expense money back. It seems that with more they add to the game the more the games traffic isses become more bothersome. Yes I can fix it with mods. However, I say I shouldnt have to. Because this game was made by the same dev that made City in motion. So clearly they have an understanding of what a city needs to run. However, they seem to have cut that out in this as in transport that has diffrent type of mass transport and effectivness in this game. The game seems to be designed for a road/highway based city. And any other methods bedamed. Which I personally find very not upset just wishing it was better. Tunnels add a new useful way to manage roads/highways. However the tunnels are not labeled so over time underground ends up looking like the L.A. freeways system but underground.Further there is not enough detailed information. Industry will complain about not having enough resources. However there is no way to just add the import costs to the city expenses. Which is very confusing because there are city view overlays that show trucks driving to industry with imports. It seems that over time the industries are not able to order more imports. This problem also effects office/commercial these sectors also lose the ability to get the goods needed to function. Moreover, If you connect industry to office/comm industry for a time sends the needed goods to the formerly mentioned sectors. Alas the mentioned issues mean that after a time the problems kick in so massive amounts of these sectors are abandoned. So you will have to delete large sections of those sectors. Moving on to transport it works by placing lines in the path you want it to go and press the  line to place the stop. That is how the game explains it to you however that it is very messy to place many lines on bus and trains/subway. Traffic is another big problem. And can not be fixed without placing messy lines of highway making your city look like the L.A. freeway system. Oh and the cars on the highway drive like ♥♥♥♥ cutting each other off and slowing down the other cars in the lanes. No matter how many subways or buses or trains I place in hotspots. People still use their cars. After playing the game for another 100+ hours my traffic controling skills are better so after about 90,000 people in my city THEN the trafic goes to poop. However this game is not marketed as a grand city builder just a basic one. So it shouldnt have taken me and extra 100 hours to get a handle on the traffic and mass transport. Moding is highly easy for this game I still find myself using very little "big" mods other than road intersections and what not because heavy mods make my game crash.   ALL PROBLEMS i LISTED ARE FIXED BY MODS, STILL BETTER THAN SIMCITY5 !!!","May 10, 2015","true","080.0"," 35 of 42 people (83%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","83","35","42","9","6"

Where do I start. I have played this game for what does it say, 18 hours or something like that? I dont even know anymore. The reason I do not know anymore is because when you start playing Skylines hours in real life seem to just disappear. You can start for the first time at 8 pm and not even realize it is now well past midnight.\n\nYou start your city with nothing but an in an out road. Maybe a Train track. You build, you develop neighborhoods, commercial areas, and industrial areas just like in all the SimCity games. Eventually you get enough people to buy an expansion slot which allows you to make your city bigger, and bigger and bigger until eventually you have this huge map that seems like there is no end to it.\n\nThe only grip I would say I have about this game is that there is a max amount of expansion slots you can buy for your city. Which I guess is alright, but it would be nice if you could just keep going and going. Then again I dont know how well that would work or even if you could keep up with maintaining the whole city from Burned Down buildings or abandonded buildings, or making sure there are enough Cemetarys in your city to go an pick up all the dead bodies each day.\n\nDo I recommend this game? ♥♥♥♥ yeah.","September 18, 2015","true","98.2"," 30 of 34 people (88%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","88","30","34","4","0"

Cities XXL was a huge miss as Focus Interactive did nothing to improve their terrible running and clunky game so the question is, did Colossal Order (a Paradox dev responsible for Cities in Motion) deliver? Yes, oh my god Yes!\n\nCities Skylines is another game in the long list of city building and managing simulators that have been trying to succeed in the shoes of what was Sim City 4; released more than 12 years ago. From the dev that created Cities in Motion, Colossal Order does something that no other city sim has done and make a truly great game that brings back the feel of Sim City 4 and my favorite of the series, Sim City 3000. They brought it back to its basics which included zones, different building types like electrical, water, fire, police, medical, fun and even the unique landmark buildings.\n\nWhen you start creating your city you start in a small 2km x 2km square that can expand as your city gets bigger and you annex other areas to a possible 25 tile, 100km2 area (with the support of a mod that is already in the steam workshop). The game also locks different building, zones, etc. behind population goals so that it isn’t too overwhelming however there are mods that allow you to unlock everything to start if you wish along with unlimited money. The game will also allow for steam workshop when it releases for people to create their own user content to add to the game which could include more buildings, new modes, user made cities and much more.\n\nAlong with the buildings and zones there are also the financial and policies that make a city sim a true city sim. They are simple enough and not as annoying as was the advisors in sim city 3000 but they change things greatly including outlawing private traffic in certain zones forcing people to take mass transit instead. What those policies and other specific buildings do is increase the happiness of the people in the commercial, residential and industrial zones. As your happiness increases they are more likely to accept higher taxes and recommend more people to move in causing an increase in desire for residential and other financial zones. I can also say that Colossal Order certainly know how to make their transport lines work and work well because every form of transportation was easy to create and maintain.\n\nThat being said the roads themselves were difficult to make sure they were right especially having off ramps connect to highways. When I bought my first annex there was a highway running through it. I thought it would have been easy enough to figure out how to implement a overpass/rounded off ramp to have access to the other side of the highway however I had to do a lot of work to get a new one working. First I had to delete the existing off ramps and highway to make way for a 4 way off ramp. On top of that in order to make sure a one way road/highway continues to go one way, instead of detecting which way automatically the roads go you to build the road in the same direction traffic would flow. Took me about 15 minutes to realize this. Hopefully it’ll be something they patch after release because I can imagine it’ll be something some people will complain about.\n\nOne other complaint, and maybe it is something I’m not used to due to the simplicity of zones in Sim City 3000, I don’t like the way zones sit for  “squares” off the road for each road you make. I’m more of a fan of dragging and dropping to make a zone like it was in SC 3000. That is just a personal preference. However all you can do with the roads is quite impressive and though I did play this game quite a bit I wasn’t able to play it enough to truly design a city that looked great.\n\nNow this game looks quite impressive and the buildings are quite varied enough to make the cities and areas look unique. Mod support and steam workshop is only going to improve the variety of buildings after release. The engine runs smooth, however capped at 60 fps (not that you really need more since this isn’t a action moving game), and looks great. The UI is clean and they actually made a change to it as I was playing my review copy in the last week.\n\nThe sound isn’t anything spectacular, however it is there and does work well with what the game is. If you zoom in to roads you can hear cars going by, if you do the same for various areas you hear what you would expect to hear if you were walking on the street. The ambient music also makes it nice to listen to while you are designing away. So nothing over the top but fits quite well.\n\nOverall, Cities Skylines, I feel, is truly the best city sim game since Sim City 4 and in fact is better than 4. It has everything that you could want in a city building game; large building areas, variety in design and buildings, unique challenges in building and managing and a great looking engine.  This is a must in my opinion for anyone that was looking for the next good city builder especially those that like to play in offline mode.\n\nReview with screenshots: http://fg-2.com/2015/03/10/review-cities-skylines/","March 10, 2015","true","4.8"," 52 of 72 people (72%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","72","52","72","4","1"

For instance, one thing speaks to how much thought has and may continue to be put into this game: the ability to close off a body of water with a dam, build pumps in it, and drain it. A short while after draining the body of water, grass soon grows on what was once dirt and you can plop down more city. You can even put sewage pumps along that area beforehand, remove the water pumps before turning them on, and flood your new stretch of city with poop water. If you really hate your citizens, you can place new water pumps in the ruins of your new-ish poop-flooded part of the city and your citizens all throughout your city will become poisoined and die.\n\nSure most of that has little to do with the whole city building thing most of the time but it tells me everything I need to know about their dedication to detail and sandbox mechanics.","March 13, 2015","true","32.8"," 29 of 34 people (85%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","85","29","34","15","0"

Secondly, I played SimCity 4: Rush Hour until today.\nNow I don't have to, because I have Cities: Skylines, which is truly a successor of it.\n\nPROs:\n- Road-engineering is really next-gen!\n- The graphics/physics are not just good, but feature cool/cute details too (for example, when a truck ramps on a highway, it bounces a bit)\n- I love the water/wind simulation (besides it is just a very small part of the game)\n- People-based simulation is fascinating, and even over 40.000 population the game runs perfectly\n- The different map layers look good, and are useful\n- The game is almost bug-free on day one! (Hello EA, I am waving at you)\n- Map size is small at the beginning, but can be expanded later, at the end is somewhat the same size as the 4x4 in SimCity 4, which is huge (EA? Are you still here?)\n- Mod and custom asset support!\n\nCONs:\n- It is hard and easy at the same time. Let me explain: to make a perfect traffic in a big city is almost impossible, if you don't want to destroy everything and make your city a big highway intersection (which I am not a fan of). On the other hand, keeping everything in terrible traffic have no consequences at all! I think this is bad, because the game doesn't reward you if you make a good traffic. I have just watched a stream when a guy used only dirty roads in his city over 40.000 pop, and the city worked perfectly. In SimCity 4, when you do this, people moves out of their homes, because the commute time is so high, and so the offices/commercial/industry will fall too. I really hope they will fix this.\n- The public transportation has some issues too. According to my experiences, only buses can be operated profitable. Also, train traffic is ridiculous: even a metropolis should have less train-traffic, and most of them operate nearly empty (10/240 passengers or so).\n- I am not a big fan of working cities with only skyscapers. In SimCity 4, when you zone high density residential, but people feel they don't want to live in a mega-block, they will build some low-dense housing instead. Like in a normal city. Here, you zone high-everything, and they just build a Manhattan in the middle of nothing.\n\nBut overall this is a great game, and I highly recommend it! Also, I am quite sure they will fix all the bugs and consider changing some of the cons I mentioned.

You can build your own interchanges/intersections/pretty much anything from scratch, and the AI will realistically follow it.\n- Mod support (Steam Workshop enabled too). The developers even endorse modding. Does EA even know what modding is anymore?\n- NO DRM! Yes yes, I know, SimCity doesnt need to always be online anymore. But this game has no DRM other than the cd key you get on Steam.\n- HUGE maps. You start with a small plot of land, but are able to purchase neighboring plots as your city grows. This means you can have a sprawling metropolis with multiple town centers/airports/highway systems.\n- The ability to divide your city in to separate districs, each able to have their own policies/taxes.\n\nIf you are on the fence about this game, definitely go for it.

To sum it up: If you only want to design a nice looking city you'll probably like this game. But if you want to build a city and to deal with challenging problems in this city you'll probably be bored very soon, because the game mechanics are too simple and not challenging at all. In my point of view this is mainly caused by the following issues:\nTraffic: Probably the only challenging problem within your city. It's ok or even a little bit too low within downtown but much too high in industrial districts. Furthermore traffic jams are often caused by the stupid AI. You'll spend much time optimizing it by building additional roads, railroads, bus lines and so on. But then again - there are almost no penalities for having a bad traffic system. Only if the traffic becomes too bad growables won't get enough resources, which again causes your citizens to abandon them.\nPollution: It has only a range of one or two blocks around your industrial areas. You only may not build residentals in this area. If you do so you'll never have any problems with pollution in your city.\nEnergy: You can build several different powerplants. Which ones you'll choose is almost completely irrelevant and just a matter of MW per $. For example: There aren't any calms, so it isn't risky powering your city with only wind energy. Coal energy generates much pollution, but then again pollution only has a range of one or two blocks. . . . . .\nCity-Services (Crime/ Fire/ Health/ Education/ Deathcare/ Leisure/ Garbage): Just build one of these buildings here and there and your growables will be all happy. There's almost no need for a clever placement of those buildings.\nGrowables: Achieving the highest levels for all of your growables is easy, because the level mainly depends on the amount of city services, which are in the neighborhood of this building.\nTourism: It is still completely broken. You cannot focus on tourism, because there are never enough tourists visiting your city.\nResource chain and industrial production: They are also very simple. Basic resources (oil, food, ore) are transformed into general goods which are transported to your commercials and then bought by your citizens. You cannot specialize into anything, like car industry or hightech industry, here.\nZoning: You almost don't need any strategy for placing your zones well or choosing a good ratio. Just avoid building too much industrials because of the traffic jams and your city probably will be fine. There's almost no variety like ways of specialization here. So appending new blocks to your city becomes pretty boring after a while.\nIncome: You will never know how well your city works, since this game automatically tries to adjust the tax income of your growables, so that your total net income is somewhere between 10 000 $ or 20 000 $. This adjustment only fails if your expenses are much too high.\nDisasters: Not really available in this game. There are just fires. They don't even spread and only destroy a single building if the fire fighters don't arrive fast enough.I could still continue with this list for a while. But at least in my view the above mentioned flaws within the game mechanics are the most important ones. So I'll stop here. There are also some minor issues with the graphics (scales of growables are wrong) and with the GUI (placing roads and bus lines often becomes tedious). But I could easily forgive those issues if the basic game mechanics were better.","November 22, 2015","false","176.6"," 565 of 948 people (60%) found this review helpful 31 people found this review funny","60","565","948","31","51"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thatcigarette/recommended/255710/","thatcigarette","Ttack","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thatcigarette/","148 products in account","After 10 hours\nThis has been a very pleasant city simulator so far in big part due to the user-friendly user interface and mechanics. The city is a joy to build, prod and tweak and you only need a few keys and your mouse buttons. While many good lessons have been learned from mobile gaming (simple menu structures, addictive feedback FX, hint stream, etc.), the game offers a good amount of depth, freedom and player challenge. The city will grow automatically but not run itself and will certainly need a strategist and grand architect. The player's role is as it should be: balancing, optimising and developing the city, not monitoring every last building and citizen, yet you still can if you want to! Speaking of, the citizens behave in a consistent and logical manner (if not an entirely rational one, but that is arguably good simulation!), making the city feel alive and controllable.\n\ntl;dr - Fun to play, full mechanics, satisfies tweakers, AI is good.\n\nThe Steam Workshop support brings a massive boost to the content just weeks after release: if you struggle with building intersections like I do, there are dozens, even hundreds of ready-made and user-tested Workshop ones available! No more eternal gridlock! There are also buildings, decorations and all sorts of stuff if the basic selection gets too repetitive. The default selection is nicely finished and has a good level of detail.\n\ntl;dr - Steam Workshop provides ideas, help and variety.\n\nThe only negatives so far are the pretty limited soundtrack, not enough variety in Chirper messages, no road ruler (grid), and the Steam Workshop items are missing their thumbnails. These are minor inconveniences so far and two can be circumvented; play your own music and keep a manageable number of content installed so you know what is what. The roads do snap straight, but sometimes it is not clear when they do, and different angles are hard to produce accurately.\n\nAll in all a great experience so far, and I haven't seen half the content yet!\n\nPS. Compared to SimCity? Better flow, nicer UI mechanics, less obtuse, better mod and community support - and no EA/Origin! There is a Paradox account you can register, but it is not mandatory. I don't know how the performance will be once my city reaches beyond two map squares, but so far there have been no slowdowns or glitches.\n\nAfter 24 hours\nStill going strong; the game has switched focus from pure growth to efficiency and large-scale management. I still get to build simple and fun new places (these maps feel pretty huge), but the core of the city is now an optimiser's dream. Education, roadworks and public transit are a real balancing act.\n\nI still can't get enough even after failing two cities miserably - they just feel like learning experiences. My main city is a place I constantly want to go back to and build and improve.\n\nThe engine shows no signs of slowing down or glitching even with four (or was it five) map squares built, and game load times are fantastic. No real bugs or glitches in sight, everything Just Works. Except Tweeter; that thing is really starting to annoy me, because it has no relevance or variety anymore.\n\nStill very much Recommended.","April 4, 2015","true","94.1"," 19 of 19 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","19","19","0","0"

The game is so easy in mastering, that you don't even need any kind of hints or tutorials when you start playing it (even if you didn't play city-builders before). You just pushing "new game" and play, interface is so handy it's like you already know where and which tool is placed. Cites: Skylines is extremely absorbing so make sure that you can allow yourself to spend huge amount time on things like videogames. Trust me, you won't even notice how your precious hours will be gone without a trace.\nHowever, the game is not perfect, there are pretty much of flaws left by developers (poor traffic AI for example). The good thing that almost all of them can be easily cured with help of mods from Steam Workshop. So if you install mods from following list, the game will be definitely a piece of cake for you :з\n\nRecommended mods\n\nAutomatic Bulldoze\nAutoSave - Configurable\nAll 25 Areas purchasable\nMod Achievement Enabler\nPrecision Engineering\nTraffic Manager + Improved AI\nP.S.\nAfter Dark is nice, but not really essential.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ErickaUnlimited/recommended/255710/","ErickaUnlimited","💝💝ErickaUnlimited💝💝","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ErickaUnlimited/","777 products in account","Overview\n\nCities: Skylines is another contender in the city simulation/building management genre. It plants its roots among games such as Sim City and Cities XL to name a select few. What Cities: Skylines does is take those games, turn them upside down and offer a fresh new perspective on a dated genre. To say the game surpasses previous games of this type would be an understatement. The game pulls ahead of the race and never looks back. The developers wanted something new and exciting and Cities: Skylines has it in spades.\n\nThe overall gameplay is much the same: you start out on a pre-defined landmass with a stack of cash and only your imagination standing in your way. It's your job to name your city, form your plan of attack and make your city thrive (or fail if that's your thing). Much like previous installments in the genre, you'll have your selection of various densities of residential and commercial business, as well as industrial zoning. Cities: Skylines adds to that, offering you the ability to specialize areas for specific purposes with city ordinances - farming and forestry, higher taxes, lower taxes, pollution control, heavy traffic bans, legalization of marijuana...you get the idea. Rather than just zone an area and let it grow, the game offers a deeper look in balancing out wants and needs of your city.\n\nAside from zoning and city ordinances, Cities: Skylines delves into other noteworthy favorites: Emergency services, schools, recreational and public transportation (roads, buses, trains, airports...etc). While most items don't have much involvement aside from adjusting budgets, you are given the ability to create a multitude of transition lines and customize the stops, name them and change the vehicle colors. It helps keep everything neat and orderly.\n\nWhere the game really shines is within its ability to create mods and custom assets that can be implemented into the game by the community via the Steam Workshop. This takes the vanilla game to a whole new level, introducing new buildings, cars, parks, landscapes to build on, monuments or something entirely brand new. Without the workshop, the game is still pleasant and quite enjoyable, but there is a lot missing in terms of diversity. The workshop gives you that diversity, practically slapping you in the face with it. It takes Cities: Skylines from a great game, to an outstanding game.\n\nNow, like all games, there is always room for improvement. While I feel the game is great and I've thoughly enjoyed my time playing it, I feel it falls short in some of the deeper city management aspects. Taxes, for example, don't often need adjusting outside a very fine line unless you want to go bankrupt or have your citizens moving en mass.\n\nOnce you get your city off the ground, it's very difficult to "lose", if you will. You'll be making money hand over fist unless you crank up the difficulty, which then makes budgeting more of a necessity, especially in the beginning of the game, but less so later on as long as you don't do anything drastic that puts you in the red. Since there are no natural disasters as of this review, and fires are localized to just the building on fire (mods do change it so they spread), widespread epidemics aren't a threat, making the need to prepare all but nonexistent.\n\nI feel the game is wonderful for what it offers, but feels too easy at times. However, I don't feel any of those negatives negate the enjoyment the game offers.\n\n\nPros\n\nModding Community - The modding community brings out this game's full potential.\nBuilding Space - The maps are huge, opening up a lot more options and the ability to have widespread districts and cities.\nThe visuals - The game is colorful and detailed enough to give your city a diverse, pretty landscape.\nRenaming - You can remain everything - from businesses, homes, vehicles and even livestock.\nWhat It's Not - The game is not Sim City 5.\nCons\n\nManagement Systems - The game lacks any in depth management aside from taxes, budgets and ordinances.\nDifficulty - The game can feel too easy once you get the feel of the mechanics. Increasing the difficulty helps to mitigate some of that, but in the long run it can still feel that way.\nNatural Disasters - As of this review, there still are none. I hope this changes in the future.\nResources - The game can be a little resource heavy and if you're like me and like assets (currently have 400+ new ones), the game can take some time between load screens, even on higher end computers.\n\nOverall, Cities: Skylines is a great city builder. It's something I had been waiting for since I played Sim City 4 into the ground back in 2004. If you're into the genre and looking for the right one, Cities: Skylines is, in my opinion, one of the best games out there at this moment. I highly recommend it.","July 9, 2015","true","145.5"," 24 of 30 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","24","30","0","0"

The simulation, the tools and the gameplay is all just so fluid. Everything runs extremely well and cities feel legitimate and alive.\n\nThe game does have some flaws here and there, yet it's still a very simple and straight to the point city builder with no bull ♥♥♥♥ attached. (DLC, DRM) It does takes quite a bit aspects from SimCity 2013 though (honestly a scary amount) but thankfully leaves all of the bad ones out.\n\nWith regards to how it compares to SimCity 4 though, I'd say SC4 is still superior but just barely. Cities: Skylines offers a more simpler and easier yet less balanced economic system than SC4 did, which isn't necessarily a good thing. SC4 also had better information screens, the ability to modify landscape in-game, and doesn't have this questionable building unlocking progression. Also, I need to mention the lack of 'God' controls and commands such as disasters that SimCity 4 did have.\n\nBut thankfully, the game has just been released and the dev team will continue to make updates for months maybe years to come and the modding community for this game is already phenomenal.\n\nGraphics: 8.5/10\n\nAudio: 8.5/10\n\nGameplay/Replay-ability: 9.25/10\n\nInterface: 8.75\n\nTraffic/Simulation: 9.25/10\n\nMod Support: 9.5/10\n\nOverall, I give this game a 9/10.","March 16, 2015","true","92.2"," 18 of 20 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","18","20","0","1"

I could deal with that - except the mods are poorly supported and very frequently break with patches leaving you with useless save games.\n\nI could even deal with that - if the patches that  the developer was putting out were fixing major issues. Thing is..they haven't. CO seems to have forgotten about the many annoyances of this game and been happy to let the modding community sort them out.\n\nUnfortunately it seems that many of the issues that this game suffers from just have not been adequately addressed by mods. Traffic is a complete nightmare with the AI behaving oddly and as such designing a high density city is incredibly tedious as you will spend 99% of your time fighting with traffic.\n\nOk - fine, we can say that the traffic is the core challenge of skylines as really beyond that the game is trivially simple - but even that turns into hours of frustration as the tools you have for building roads are amazingly clunky. Some of the most popular mods are ways of disabling pillars, road intersection angle limitations and slope limitations for roads - but even those mods are tedious to use as you have a very clunky interface for building roads and no built in teraforming tools. The mods that do exist are clunky to use or result in incredibly ugly and unrealistic looking roads.\n\nThese are all issues that have been listed from day one - so where are we a year later? Same place of course! CO has released a pair of unimpressive DLCs which are mostly cosmetic and at times annoying. After Dark does not add much except tunnels that is of any use and the night mode is just another layer of frustration as building at night is difficult - unless you get that mod that lights up your mouse cursor. Snowfall adds trams which are basically expensive buses with no other advantages that I can see - there is effectively no real reason to use them besides aesthetics as metro and buses get the job done better and easier.  Heated pipes offer little change in the game.\n\nSo here we are - a year later and the game still feels like it needs ~30 essential mods to enjoy and even that enjoyment is basically fighting with the road building system for 2 hours to build a single good looking and working highway off-ramp.\n\nI really want to love this game but every single time I play it I feel more drained and frustrated by it than my day job.","February 22","false","68.1"," 27 of 36 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","27","36","2","0"

Did you not play city sims before, and you are looking for a good place to start? Either way this game is a brilliant choice for you. The content offering it provides is abselutely insane. Compared to the already mentioned SimCity, I would say you get 5x the game for 1/3 the price. After 450 hours of gameplay, I have never "finished" any city to the point where I could not expand any further. To top it all off, basically any annoying gameplay issue you encounter can be solved in 5 minutes of browsing the workshop.\n\nI will now get picky and point out the biggest weaknesses I have found during my hundreds of hours of playtime, but keep in mind that I would never play the game that much if I did not love it in it's current state.\nThe DLC is not worth it. The DLC almost costs half of the game itself, and adds very little to the gameplay. After Dark mostly makes it very annoying to build half of the time, because it is, you know... dark at night. Apart from that the gameplay around the day/night cycle is not that appealing, to me at least. Snowfall would be worth if there was a season cycle, but you either have permanent snow, or no snow at all.\nSome mods are almost mandatory. I don't consider this a big issue, but I know nothing about the performance implications of mods on low end machines. The game is totally playable without mods, I actually had every steam achievement available before DLC, so I have enjoyed quite some hours with no mods. It is just that when you first start modding, it's really hard to go back(this is why I don't have any of the DLC achievements, lol).\nSome costs seem very unbalanced. In the "standard game" I often found myself splitting my budget 50/50. Between garbage plus death services, and everything else... Why is as expensive to burn your garbage as it is to upkeep all your hospitals, fire stations, and police stations combined? These things are really easy to mod on your own though, so again, it's not a game breaking issue.\nIf you think you might enjoy the game a quarter as much as I do, it's probably your best buy you ever made.","April 5","true","487.1"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","15","17","0","0"

Yeah, you saw that very intensive simulation in spreading work force and trash trucks, haha. (besides it was obviously possible to play off line from the beginning)\n\n\nUPDATE [24/05/15] Some minor stuff has been fixed. And although I did not play with the newest patch released some days ago yet, most issues which annoy me are - according to patch notes - still there.\n\nWhen rating the game, I do so without mods. And without, the game gets pretty fast boring (for me) if you want more than just a "build the prettiest city sandbox". In my opinion mods are great for enhancing replayability or making smyller adjustments - but they should not become a necessity.\n\nAnd even though I had to think a long time about it, I still find my negative rating fitting.\n\n\n\nThis game is sort of a hate-love-relationship.\nWhen I started playing it I really love the game:\n- graphics is not overwhelming but looking good, giving a nice city building flair\n- sound is soothing and does not get onto one's nerves\n- relatively good balanced progress\n- not feeling too fast or slow and I only seldom sped up the time\n- building/maintenance costs are fine\n- tax management simple but still ok\n- love how water/energy systems works (not too simple, not too much micro-management)\n- street system is doing good\n- district system nice, especially with the different resources for industry\n- actual water physics simulation! Building a hydro dam(n) needs real planning (and some testing, save your game ;) )\n\n\nThen I found some flaws; the in-game message chirper is kind of annoying (and badly placed btw), it's ridiculous to not being able to scroll with holding right mouse button, some view management is sorta weird and transportation volumes are not realistic.\nThis is where the mods come in: for all those and more minor issues I found good working fixes in the workshop and from what I saw, some of the issues were fixed in the past, so in time you might even be able to go without them.\n\n\nBut - here it comes - in the long run, the game does not fit my needs.\nIn general it's too easy. After some harder times (in terms of cash problems) in the beginning, it gets pretty easy as soon as you get to use the high density zones. In my second city,  with a tax rate of 12% for everything after setting it to 14 for a short time, then going down to 12   I had a plus of 10k+/week. Even though I kept building here and there and making everything looking nice, I was not able to spend my money faster as I got it.\n\nUp until then it is real fun. But from this point, it is making the game a bit too sandbox-like with the focus on "how to make it look nice" and without the hassle for careful planning how and where to expand the city.\n\nBesides this, there are some really down-bringing issues in the game, that get more un-nerving in the long run.\nThese are mostly unrealistic behavior or balance issues:\n- Electricity production is a joke. From the beginning, wind-energy is in term of $/W not only cheaper than any coal or gas plant, but also non-polluting. As soon as you get the solar power plant, you don't have to worry about energy at all, as it is even cheaper. Also neither wind nor sun energy has differing output, like dynamic wind speed or clouds. So there is no reason at all to not build wind/solar plants\n- The resource system does not have a real depth: Yes, you can set specific districts for agriculture, ore, oil or forest industry. But besides more/less tas and pollution (and different buildings, obviously), there is no really meaning in that. Yes, you can use the oil for your oil energy plant, but why? Wind is still cheaper. And there is no big difference in export or anything, too.\n- While the water pollution system is nice, the land pollution is very very friendly. Have a coal power plant? Well, pollution only spreads about one-two blocks - after that you can build residences again.\n- AI for garbage and death care needs improvements. Death care: In larger cities (30k+), there are continually areas where dead people wait for transport to the crematory or grave yard - even if you have enough of them and they are not using all of their vehicles yet. Garbage: Trucks are working (yes, SC in your face :D ) but the system to send the garbage from a full dump to a incineration plant is not good. Even the old SC4 was working better in that case.\n- UI/views. I still cannot click a street and see who is going where, like SC4 rush hour -> this might improve the generally nice transportation system a lot!\n\n\n\nOverall:- The game lacks in terms of content: some areas (medicine) are great - others (power, industry resources, politics, tourism, ..) have too few buildings/possibilities.\n- Simulation is not realistic enough/goes not deep enough. Too easy power simulation, too easy fire/crime/medicine/education system, no real impact of industry/resource choices, etc.\n\n\nAs said before:\nIf you want to just build a nice city, go ahead. I had a great time so far with the game. Had to install a few mods for that, but with them it is fun for some time.\n\nIf you expect a nice city builder simulation, maybe it's better to wait for a DLC/the next part. Seeing that the game seems to be quite successful in terms of sold copies, I guess there is a good chance for one or the other :)","April 3, 2015","false","65.6"," 657 of 1,175 people (56%) found this review helpful 73 people found this review funny","56","657","1","73","59"

You like building, you will love this game, shoot if you love managing or sim games you will love this one.

There is a load of unique buildings, many transportation options, and so much more. Anything you want in a city builder this game has it! However, it is also a challenge, you wont have incredible city very quickly. A lot of issues can hit you hard while your population expands, my only complaint is that you need many, many, many, service buildings to cover a very large city, To much in my mind, I hope they tweak that because it can really drain your income.

The lacking aspects beyond some more services (such as libraries or museums from SC2K for example), are mostly in the fine details, as creating transit lines can get quite finicky, and having to manually demolish abandoned building becomes a chore with a large city.

More on that later, first my list of pros and cons;\n\nPROS:\n\n- Water has current, which you have to plan for so as not to polute your own shores.\n- Water can controlled, both current and levels using hydro dams.\n- Citizens have specifically assigned residences (and jobs), making traffic more realistic.\n- The various interface overlays makes determining the placing of utility structures very easy.\n- You can practically do anything you want to when it comes to roads/highways/ramps.\n- Graphics are superb and performance is amazing, regardless of zoom level.\n- You get the feeling of SimCity, without the bad taste it left behind.\n- Completely customizable routes for buses, subways, and trains.\n- High number of road types for you to select, everything from gravel to highways.\n\nCONS:\n\n- Constant "tweets" got pretty annoying after a while.\n- Tweets about problems that shouldn't exist (ex. dead person, with a crematorium next door).\n- Building with full fire coverage would burn down and prompt you to check fire coverage.\n- Not enough options to deal with garbage and collection ranges seemed unrealistic.\n- A lot of specialty buildings had "noise" zones that seemed unreasonably large.\n- No real options to deal with industry polution, other than to keep it away from everything else.\n- Not enough random building names, I'd often find 6-8 buildings in a row with the same name.\n- Small number of maps included (although more are available).\n- No way (that I've found) to have a subway come to the surface.\n- No streetcars\n- Ships (cruise/cargo) movement seemed extremely unrealistic, as if it was an afterthought.\n- Music is EXTREMELY repetative, I had to turn it off after a while.\n- Road "snapping" can be annoying when working on highway offramps, even when it's supposedly turned off.\n\nNow that I've given you that basic list, let's get down to brass tax.  Everyone is correct when they say that this game is everything that SimCity should have been.  That said, it is lacking in a few basics that SimCity actually had.  The biggest thing in my list of pet peves for this game would have to be garbage collection.  In my 80,000 population city (real life) there is one garbage dump and the entire city's garbage has been going there since the city was built.  In this game, by the time my population was 10,000 I had 4 garbage dumps spread out across the landscape.  By the time I hit 80,000 there was an entire district devoted to garbage dumps (10 of them) with 6 insinerators trying (unsuccessfully) to keep them from being full.  I even had the recycling policy in place, and still my garbage dumps were overflowing.  Oh, that's another thing, no recycling centers?\n\nAnyway, when you put this game beside SimCity there really isn't any question that Cities: Skylines is the superior game overall.  It does have it's issues, but it's by far the best all around city building game that's been produced.  Don't go into this game expecting your every city building dream to come true, just enjoy it for what it is.\n\nEDIT:\n\nSince the addition of the Workshop to Cities:Skylines most of the problems I mentioned are easily solved by downloading 3rd party workshop items, like a recycling center.  This game is now my #1 city building game.","March 19, 2015","true","39.1"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","12","13","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rockstarcro/recommended/255710/","rockstarcro","RockstarCRO","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rockstarcro/","252 products in account","This is a fantastic city building game, but if you are looking for the ability to drive around your city as shown in Sim City 3 and up, not quite it. I'm also going to give you a warning that this game may eat away at your hours.\n\nReading over the reviews, I've seen this game a multitude of times compared to Sim City. The biggest comparison I see is that, this game has been labelled "easier". In some sense it's true, but when you realize how big your city can be and the unique styles you can give to your roads, it can get complicated. The game is about building up a city, but eventually turns into managing one instead of it managing itself.\n\nThe gameplay is relatively simple. Everything is laid out for you, and as your city grows, so does your ability to build upgraded or newer buildings. Taxes can be adjusted, budgets can be adjusted (for parks, buses, water works, electricity etc...), and loans can be taken out. Even if you are not extremely familiar how economics work in a municipality, the game does it's best to advise you of everything going on. Placing police stations, fire stations, hospitals, or even schools becomes very easy as the game does an extremely good job in showing which areas are covered. What can drive a few people nuts is putting water pumps near sewage dumps. At first, you may smile as you see water is being delivered to your residents and that the sewage water is far away (especially in the first level with the lake). You'll then notice a lot of water being polluted and eventually making it's way up to your water pumps.\n\nIt is imperative that my readers know to build down stream or to use water towers where sewage may be an issue! They also make it easy to see what crime rates are (check the top left of your screen), what your citizens happiness is, pollution, electricity and water availability, natural resources and a few others. The biggest feature in the game to me it seems, is the ability to really architect the roads. In Sim City, you are able to put zones wherever you please. In Skylines, you have only the choice to build near roads. Zoning is made easy and can be done with a fill brush tool or individual squares can be assigned. A huge feature in Skylines is districts. Districts are designed by you and are designated by you as well. Want a forest industry? Want a mining industry? Want a farming industry by residential areas? This can be done through districts. Definitely a notable feature in the game. Bus stops and other sort of transport is available. They try to give you as much control as possible within the game. Bus stops are designated by you and are placed where you'd like them to be. At first it is difficult to control where the bus goes when placing the stops, but choosing the RIGHT side of the road is important for it to work properly!\n\nVisuals and sounds are appropriate. The music is neither condemning or over the top, but the repitid Sounds follow your screen, and you will hear buildings burn if they are on fire. At first glance, I thought traffic was extremely horrible in my city. I zoomed in closer and saw they actually park their cars in front of their house. Good to see the attention to detail put in.\n\nI bought this game on sale and am quite content with the product. I would like to have a feature where I can drive through my city or even go on a rampage with a truck. Maybe it's asking too much from a city builder, but having complete control like this is what differentiates the best from the rest.\n\nRATING : 7.5/10\n\nGameplay	B+	Story / Campaign	N/A	Visuals / User Interface	B	Sounds / Music	B	Replay-ability	B-	Overall 	B\n\n\nScreenShots :\nSCREENSHOT 1\n\nSCREENSHOT 2\n\nPretty much completed\n\nNot the ideal screenshot of showing off a bridge\n\nI thought the bus stops in my city were crowded\n\nEven emergency vehicles do not pass a funeral procession","May 26, 2015","true","47.5"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","12","13","2","0"

I believe that it was called Cities: Skylines for a reason. The usage of plural noun, in this case 'cities' instead of 'city' really lives up its name.

Over the years I have created many custom buildings (mainly Paris and medieval themes) and mods (amongst other the Jupiter (weather) and the Aurora mods) for simcity-4. Simcity 2013 was a major disappointment on all accounts.\n\nI have been fortunate to have been invited to test Cities Skylines' modding tools during the beta phase for the past couple of months. And during that time I have also been able to play the game. Cities Skylines exceeds my expectations. The potential that can be unlocked by the community and by DLCs provided by CO is unbelievable. I am absolutely overwhelmed by how great this game is.\n\nAdditionally, I have gained the utmost respect for CO. It is unbelievable what a small team of creative people can do. Aside from developing a fantastic game, CO actually listens to the community to the best of their abilities.\n\nBound by an NDA, it has been challenging for me not being able to respond to all the comments, questions, critisicm, (sometimes unjust) speculation on the forums. And I kept thinking if only you could get to play the game for half an hour and - like me - become captivated by studying the little CIMS in their daily routine, or laying out the most amazing road interchanges. Finally a game I can enjoy again without having to shoot someone.\n\nOff course some I do share some of the criticism that also has been shared on the forums. I could even create a list of a dozen or more features that I would like to see changed or improved. But all that is driven by my enthusiasm for this game, and there is a time a place for everything. So for now I am just giving this game a 10/10.","March 10, 2015","true","275.6"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","0"

But after the initial wow factor, I am finding it rather shallow in terms of challenge.  There are a lot of tax tweaking options but i've never had to touch them, I have a very healthy income whatever I do.  Where are the problems faced by mayors?  People are asking for help on how to get the crime rate above 50% achievement - this shouldn't be something people need help with, it should be easy to make happen just through bad city management.  I wish my doctors would go on strike, or that a riot would happen, or that schools demanded a bigger budget.  Even the wind reducing a bit during certain seasons would give me a challenge because my city is powered 100% by clean wind power.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/whoota/recommended/255710/","whoota","[T-A!] Whoota","http://steamcommunity.com/id/whoota/","307 products in account","City building, one of the great monuments of mankind. Isn't the blatent repurposing of the earth's bounty for our mundane consumption and shelter the epitomy what it means to be human? Yes it is. And when you play Cities: Skylines you will come to appreciate the craftsmanship and skill involved in such an undertaking.\n\nIt took me seven resets before I finally got a city running properly; and even then did I throw all my progress and work out the window just because it wasn't perfect enough. City building is strategy game in the truest form. It requires long term planning and foresight. Overlooking any aspect at the start can come back to haunt you later on. Like in my first city, everything was running smoothly until everyone fell ill from polluted drinking water. The tides from the coast weren't very good at disposing the sewage. So instead of fixing it, I decided to throw all that away and found a new city alongside a flowing river instead.\n\nWith the water problem covered for now a new plague rose up. Power. I had to learn a few tricks from a pretty good youtuber to get the basics down; he showed you could start a city with a single wind tubine and save much more money for facilities. However, turbines are fickle and the wind is their enabler. As a result, it became a structural struggle to provide power for my budding metropolis. Once again, I threw the stuff away and started a new city, besides a river, on a hillside.\n\nAt this point it should be clear that this game has a significant learning curve. You really need to invest and try stuff to get the hang of it. However, it does turn out to be rewarding, as your city vivibly evolves under your direction. It is welcoming to see a game so strong in visual feedback. A bustling city is more amusing to behold than a dying one, so it is an extra motivator to keep exploring and trying for new stuff.\n\nNow I'm in my 5th game and power and water are no longer a problem. The real challenge presents itself when you're expanding. Expanding is hard. You basically have to create a new city from scratch, and you effectively double your resource consumption in the process. Once again, your early choices make all the differences. Depending on how you positioned your first district in regards to the highway can make all the difference for the new stream of inhabitants and commuters. You'll have to consider traffic flows from a very early point to make them work in the long run. And that is how I began my 6th city.\n\nSo after much trial and error, I am now running my 8th city and it is running like clockwork. I even have a booming oil and ore industry, as well as a modern office district and many options for easy living. At this point it helps to explore the extremely well crafted advisor windows. These intergrated menu screens can give you a direct glimpse into the affairs of your metropole. Fire safety, crimerate, congestion, pollution; it's all expertly depicted with easy to understand colour graphs and real time feedback from the system about current problems. The interface is such a marvel, I think more games could benefit from it.\n\nAs your city grows, your scope zooms out and you move away from street corner politics and small scale renovations. Your footprint grows and so does your city. City: Skylines is possibly the best city building game ever made. Thanks to its direct feedback from the real time game, excellent interface and amazing graphics, it is a game worth building a city in, and then to wish you could one day live in it.\nGranted that you don't mess up at the start because no one wants to live in highway congestion. Punishing at the start. It certainly rewards the intrepid frontier's men/women.","March 20","true","20.9"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","12","15","0","1"

You can say that this game is community called Sim City 5, because this is more of Sim City that Sim City 2013. It playes well, it runs well, maps are huge and expandable, it's sometimes hard, but as soon as you get used to it- you're good to go. Yet it lacks some non critical stuff, like terraforming in Mayor mode and day and night cycle. I really desire to see those implemented in future updates if that is even possible. Everything else is a mix of SimCity 1 and 4 with tons of cool additions, like districts, resource system, sound pollution, few new services, it's a great mix i must admit. Developers also care about modmakers, they supplied us with object editor, map editor and implemented steam workshop, this will give a huge lifespan to this game.

I poured countless hours into it and created huge sprawling cities, one after the other. But when I started to dig deeper into the gameplay and strategic elements of this game such as managing the cities economy and taxes, I've come to find that the game falls flat in many aspects. The overall look and feel of the cities you create come to feel quite lifeless with nothing much in the design giving much excitement. Landmarks are very limited unless you go through the modding community, end game structures are completely broken, such as practically leveling up every building to maximum across the whole city with one building, plus unrealistic in their function. The maps themselves are very uninteresting, and flat. I would have hoped that the expanstions would have brought more to the game but the night expansion was a complete waste of money and gave me maybe a couple hours of interest. And an expansion to add permanent snow? No thanks. I also can't understand the idea that poorer people are happy to pay more taxes and wealthy people are capped at paying someting like 11-12% and even if you improve their area, it's not ever possible to raise the taxes without them abandoning. The district system seems interesting at first but despite it looking to deep, I've never really found any interesting ways of implementing them other than 'oh industrial area so I guess I'll add the fire alarms ordinance here' etc... its all very obvious and repetitive. I really want to like this game, and I like Paradox games in general, but I just can't agree with the amound of praise this game is getting. Even the zoning design is terrible as patches of grass appear everywhere making the city look incomplete. Having lived in a city my whole life I know what a city should look like and Paradox are not quite hitting the mark I'm afraid. Also the farms are terrible too, since when are farms zoned in small blocks? They just don't look realistic at all. The one thing this game does well and that is the traffic system. Controlling the flow of traffic on this game is quite beautifully done and that is what the game is, it's basically one big traffic sandbox. I do hope to find a new found interest in this game some day, but unfortunately I think that its lifespan may well have turned out to be even worst than SimCity :s","February 20","false","165.3"," 55 of 95 people (58%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","58","55","95","8","7"

It’s very easy to spend hours/days/months on a single map and fine-tune it to your liking, which is a tremendous value.  The fact that it supports a map editor and Steam Workshop is all the more reason why the price tag is more than generous.  Some may see “Cities: Skylines” as a “SimCity” clone, but honestly, who cares?  If we put aside the fact that the former does things the latter doesn’t do, there aren’t enough stable and fun city-management games out on the market, so why complain?

The maximum land size was one of them. A measly 2x2 KM block of land was ALL you could get in SimCity 2013.\n\nNow you might ask why do I bring up SimCity? Because, obviously, this game is a lot like SimCity (who would have guessed!) except it doesn't have its flaws.\nThis game is, in my eyes, by far the best city builder since Simcity 4.\n\nOne of the biggest issues with Simcity 2013 was the plot size. Well guess what, this game can be 8 times larger at the very least and 24 times larger with a simple mod!\nThat's also part of the exquisite beauty of this game; mods. This game fully suppors modding if you didn't figure it out already. There's already several thousands mods on the Workshop, and that number is expanding by the hour!\n\nAnother big issue in this game was traffic, even though traffic behaves mostly the same, from what I've seen/played/heard/read the traffic is much more manageable in here, simply because you can expand your cities, easily upgrade your roads and build intricate intersections, overpasses and so forth.\nSomething new this game has is called 'Districts'. Districts carry a load of potential, as they can specialise your chosen area to a certain type of Industry, limit your density of Residential, Industry or Commercial Zones and put certain Policies per District.\n\nIt is quite a bit slower than Simcity 2013 though, don't expect to hit 400.000 citizens within 5 or 6 hours, your city builds up slowly.\nOne of the main complaints I've seen is that cities seem much more populated than the civ number, this is because the civ number shown is the actual number of simulated agents. The actual people you might see is probably quite a bit higher.\n\nI have no idea whether or not this review makes a lot of sense to you, but if it does, be sure to check this great and time-consuming game out because DAMN is it awesome.","March 14, 2015","true","52.3"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/arkangel/recommended/255710/","arkangel","Iron Angel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/arkangel/","42 products in account","I will start off with saying that I can't recommend this game. Which is a shame.\n\nIt just isn't a finished product in my opinion. You will get something that resembles a release ready product if you choose to use the Workshop and download assets and mods. This will however prove to be an unwise decision as when a new DLC+patch comes, you can most likely say goodbye to your city. You will at least have a very hard time getting it to run like it did the day before said content was released.\n\nMany are praising the game for its water dynamics, I won't. Actually I think the water is really bad. Build a dam? The water will have none of that and start flowing upstreams just to get away from it. I would had been excited over the water if you could add streams when creating maps in the editor. Like drawing a stream with a special tool to tell the water which direction to go and intensity.\n\nLet's talk about powerplants.\nThere are seven of them to choose from, two of which are windpower and two which you most likely will never use. Those two would be the dam and the solar power plant. The dam is useless because of how water functions in the game, no it is not me that is incompetent. I have done a lot of testing in the editor to try and get it right for a dam, and honestly it is such a pain to get it to work that you are better off just plopping down windpower or any of the rest. Even the solarplant would be better. Nice clean energy to power your city, right? No. Nighttime was added to the game, and for some reason in the universe this game plays out in, they have not invented any method to store generated extra power. So when the darkness falls, there will be no tv watching or showering for your cims, as the plant produces 0 energy for the duration of the night.\n\nDid you read somewhere that they where introducing weather in the newest DLC+patch? Did you also hear them saying that the weather was cosmetic? Well...it isn't. Apparently the "cosmetic" fog will block out the sun and lower the effeciency of your solar plant. "Cosmetic" rain will make the temperatures drop so your cims use more power to heat their homes. Doesn't really sound that cosmetic, does it?\nAll that is fine, this is what happens in real life with weather, but the cluelessness of the publisher stating obvious wrong facts in interviews is not. So with the nighttime and fog, you might just want to skip that solar power plant.\n\nThe AI in the game is horrible. I am sure you have heard about it on forums and such. The cars will force themselves into one or two lanes instead of using the full potential of the roads. Emergency vehicles will patiently keep behind the other drivers and so on.\n\nAnother thing that is quite annoying is the complete lack of developer presence on the game's forums here on Steam. In my opinion, if you choose to release a game on Steam you should also be bothered with the big community it will gather there. I think that the sole reason for Cities: Skylines "success" is that people where desperate after something else after being let down by Simcity: 2013.\n\nIf you decide to buy this game you will get some fun out of it at the beginning, but you will with no doubt get more and more annoyed later on when finding more and more stuff in the game that simply does not work, or works in a very odd way.\n\nDefender of the devs need not comment about this and that, if this is the best game in the world for you and everything works like a charm then go and make a positive review and enjoy your game.","March 1","false","152.0"," 24 of 38 people (63%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","63","24","38","4","0"

You start with a fairly decent sized square of land and can expand this out into a sprawling metropolis - giving you the satisfaction of seeing your efforts bloom into a real "city" rather than just an increasily busy, small square.\n\nOthers have covered far more in-depth than I have - but from my point of view, as a casual player who likes to dip and out of the game, slowly building up a city that I can see previous efforts and decisions continue to impact, the game is an absolute winner.\n\nHighly recommend it!","March 12, 2015","true","7.5"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

I feel bad for saying this because the people at Paradox Interactive seem like a cool group of people. I'm pleased it has done so well for them in such a short period of time. I hope it leads to further improvements! CO seems interested in gathering feedback on the forums.\n\nSkylines does many things right - ease of road construction, traffic modeling, and the city builder basics. By far the aspect I enjoyed most was building roads and watching the traffic. I don't get into the creative aspect of city building, so my contentment comes from overcoming challenges provided by a detailed simulation. I need to feel like traffic problems matter more than they do in Skylines. People should be mad when traffic prevents them from arriving at their destination. Businesses should shut down if their workers never arrive. I didn't really have money issues, which maybe would be solved by using the hard mode mod. It is a pretty beginner-friendly game, so don't expect a great challenge out of the box.\n\nI think creative types would get more out of the game then I do, and beginners to the genre are given a warm fuzzy hug. My negative comments aside, I do think it is the best of the 'traditional' city builder type of games - the new SimCity and Cities XL. It's also kept my interest longer than Banished due to the interesting road building in Skylines. By their nature, city builders can get repetitive and I don't have a high tolerance for that.\n\nI hope the game gets a lot of post release support, and Paradox has a great track record when it comes to that. Maybe after some updates my opinion will be a little more positive.

It's such a smooth game to play. It runs like a throughly tested, well polished game. The vibrant colors and excellent soundtrack in the game instantly puts me in the mood to build my dream city. The game tools provides one with an abundance of creativity. So much so that I felt overwhelmed with all that I am able to do. I'm only limited by my imagination not the game mechanics which is awesome! Some of my favorite aspects of the game is the simulated people, yes folks each little pixlated person is an indivisual in City Skylines! I love the water dynamics and how they can create a challenge which adds to gameplay and not take away from it. I love all of the transportation options with more types promised in the future. I love the soundtrack and if I had only one regret, it was not getting in on that pre-order offer to get it.  But what I love most, is the potential of this game through the modding community. This game is built with modding in mind. Can you imaging the many props and gameplay mods that will flow from the talented modders for this game? I can hardly wait, and guess what? The modders are already making assets and gamemods for Cities as you read this. I honestly can't praise this game enough. If you are interested in City Builders and you've been burned by other games, look no further. Cities will most likely satisfy everything you've ever wanted in a city builder game.

I had my pet peeves with SimCity 4 and was very much so looking forward to SimCity 6 (2013) which ended up being an EXTREME disappointment and should have been called SimTown instead. I was finding myself completing a City in less than 2 hours, and got so frustrated with the game that I took to their Facebook page and left a rather lengthy post that hundreds of others seemed to share the same feelings in regards to the lack of attention put into the game.\n\nThen comes Cities: Skylines. My girlfriend actually purchased a copy for me as a gift and I had my eye on it for awhile, just never made the purchase because I didn't have time to play (full-time developer).\n\nI can honestly say this is everything that SimCity SHOULD have been, or at least what EA Games promised us it would be.\n\n-> [ Steam Workshop ]\nThe steam workshop is the HUGE seller for me. Almost any building, tool and mod is available to integrate into the game. I have well over 200 addons packed into my game, and almost an endless supply of buildings I can place, which ensures my city doesn't look the same everywhere. This is probably my FAVORITE thing about the game, is the huge support for this game through the workshop.\n\n-> [ Detailed Building Tools ]\nEverything from the terrain tools, the different types of roads you can place, and the ability to toggle the grid system on/off makes it possible to pretty much create anything you want. No two cities should look alike if you truly utilize the tools you are given.\n\n-> [ Sandbox Mode ]\nWhen I play these simulators, I don't like going through and playing the scenarios and having to watch my money. This game gives me the ability to have an unlimited source of money, and just build away.\n\n-> [ Game Engine ]\nEverything is beautiful in regards to the games appearance and performance. FPS is extremely smooth, and the entire city looks amazing (especially at night with the lights on). I haven't ran into any bugs, and I can pretty much crank the graphics up to ultra for everything, and the level of detail is very very real.\n\n-> [ Traffic ]\nIt is relatively easy to control traffic in this game. You just have to map out where your dense traffic is going to be, and adjust accordingly with the right roads, and the other methods of transportation are great as well! (Bus, airport, tram, etc).\n\nI did find one minor annoyance. It appears that Sims get sick quite frequently, especially in a highly populated city. Theirs almost never a moment where I don't hear an ambulance screaming past me where I'm building.  In fact one time, I was just browsing the city, and one of my main busy roads had 17 ambulances one after another, going to different calls... that's a little excessive.... I don't even see them that much in Los Angeles...\n\nOverall, it's a great game, and definitely worth the price. I think the DLCs are a little over-priced for what they provide, but that's certainly not a reason to not by the game.\n\nIt looks like EA Games is no longer the king of City Simulators.\n\nRegards,\nRichard\nYouTube: IAMRichardT","April 9","true","18.9"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","82","9","11","2","3"

It was a good game on Day 1 but it has went downhill since with prominent issues not being fixed, pointless/cosmetic DLC being introduced, and the community being mostly ignored by the developers. Paradox Interactive staff have been brilliant with offering support/help for the game, it's just a shame they are acting as the middleman between the end user and the developers.\n\nUntil the core game mechanics are fixed, I will not be recommending this to future buyers.\n\nEDIT: As of now it seems that the Developers have almost completely abandoned this game and ran off with their money.

Sure you have Tropico and like games but they just are not the same, you are building an island nation, instead of zoning you are plopping everything down, much like Sim City Societies which flopped for that very reason (See the paragraph below).\n\nFor ten years these fans have wonder though the wastelands waiting for a true sucessor to SC4, first came Sim City Societies but it was much like SIm Town, a game where you just placed everything down much to the distaste of anyone who wanted to zone the land and watch as the sims took up shop and resident in to the city. You also had the Cities X(X)L sersies (by NO WAY related to this game, the devs of this game made Cities in Motion). WHose frequent bugs, non working code, and failed promases time after time left a bitter taste in these fans mouths. The dev of Cities X(X)L have a habbit of just releasing the same game year after year full of the same bugs.\nThen you have SIm City 2013 (aka Sim City 5) This failure of a game was due to many reasons, the inability of EA knowing what made Sim City a sucessful and much loved sersies. Instead of sharing our creations with the world we had to now play againts the world (when it worked!) and always be online which was a "tenchinal limitation" (until it wasn't) The failure of the glassbox engine to actually simulate things outside of poop was also an issue (Those who are going to say it simulated more then that I know, I am making a point).\n\nSo today brings us Cities: Skylines a phenox in the burt ashes of hopes and dreams. Even if the phenox is a circular blue bird who chirps out what sim..I mean cims are thinking it is still a job well done by CO. Although basic in many levels as opposed to SC4 it is a much needed refresh form this small studio, I expect many great things to come in updates, patches and DLC.","March 10, 2015","true","34.1"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

That feeling of "wow this is going to be great, a modern take on city building"? Do you remember the sheer disappointment that was experienced when you discovered that you not only had to queue for hours after purchasing the day, it was online only? EA at the time said it was because their Agenting System Glassbox was doing intricate calculations and that most PCs couldn't handle it. Of course, that turned out to be rubbish. Anyway, do you remember being locked down to your 2x2km area and wishing you didn't have to exit to the region and start a new city? With Cities: Skylines, Collosal draws upon those promises and excels. Building from their Transportation simulator, this game is the modern city builderthat you wanted. That isn't to say that it is perfect. There are stil some odd UI design choices and other input designs, but it does all those things that it was claimed SimCity couldn't do.  Today, I followed a citizen in a car. He was uneducated, and going home to his house in his district. He also had a dog. Then he went to work a convenience store. After work, he went back to the same address in the same car with the same dog. There is no slowdown in my experience, but I haven't built a huge city either. From what I can tell the game does provide a challenge and it also has that cool "tilt-shift" camera perspective that was used in SimCity.\nThe game is gorgeous. Not only that but there is a terrain editor and an asset editor built in. For the money, you get a lot of value. Also there is still room for DLC! Special things no doubt which would only add to the game. Oh, did I mention that the game features left and right hand driving? I think there is also a multiplayer mode.\n\nWith the asset editor you can build your own road configurations. So instead of just dragging out streets, You can just place predefined Streets. Want to build your own intersection? You can. Want to build your own park? You can do that as well! There is also SteamWorkshop from the start. You can download whatever you want. Built a cool map of London or Johannesburg? You can do that. Because while yes you are intiially restricted to 2x2km of building space, You can purchase more lots of land up to an official 6x6km map size. This is 3 times the size of SimCity Maps!\n\nThe game contains so much more value than SimCities or Cities XL/XXL. You might think it would be very expensive, but the price is more than reasonable. In fact the devs could easily have charged twice, and I still would have gotten it.\n\nI am terrible at city builders, but needed to have an itch scratched. This game does juat that!

Replace the entire broken simulation engine with something that actually works and scales well. Make the map bigger and massively expandable. Throw in a whole bucket of small "why didn't anyone think of THAT before?" features that aren't quite transformative but deliver enough of an impact to get you grinning ear to ear.\n\nOh, and divide the launch price by two. Voila! You have Cities: Skylines.\n\nWhile this is not quite a genre-defining, groundbreaking upgrade over the 12-year-old SimCity 4 (it still lacks region play and inter-city trading), it manages to build on most of that legendary title's major milestones while also replicating almost entirely the presentational charms of its botched sequel. The game has its fair share of mild annoyances, most of which involve the way its massive piles of data are presented to the player, but it speaks volumes that one of its greatest issues is how difficult it is to praise it without comparing it to SimCity.\n\nMaxis is dead. Long live Colossal Order. A tiny studio from Finland (with a hilarious CEO) has accomplished a feat that previously eluded more illustrious development teams for more than a decade.

I want to keep it simple because of the lack of hours however, here I go for the new players =D\nPros: 10\n1.  Very nice balance you have to integrate in your cities' design between the  residential (low/high density) vs commercial (low/high density) vs industrial.\n2.  Day and Night cycle affects the functions of cities which is new for me. Ex The sound pollution at night in a leisure district affects low density residents.  There are many more examples.\n3.  This game doesn't spell anything out for you besides using the basic functions of zoning, road connecting, traffic etc.  You have to experiment for yourself to see how policies, roads, crime, or new building work together.  If you are a cookie cutter gamer, you might not like this pro.\n4.  The economy is how you control your city. Its the lifeline.  IF you have no money all you can do is raze structures, rezone, tax higher, redistrict.  No more city buildings to aid your zones.\n5.  Land values increase your taxes, if you design your city well to meet individual needs, equity goes up.\n6.  Graphics are fantastic. It makes it easy to get lost in your creation.\n7.  Rename businesses, districts, citizens, buildings.\n8.  Workshop content keeps the game fresh once you break that last few achievements.\n9.  You can create your own maps to build your own cities in if you dont care for default variants.\n10.  Set paths for buses and metros to combat the terrors of the common enemy in cities: rush hour.\nCons: 4\n1.  The Zoned buildings will be repetitive.\n2.  Puting in water pipes can feel like busy work.\n3.  No natural disaster to spice up the game once you are satisified with your creation(possibly a future mod or expansion I hope).\n4.  Traffic lights = Inefficient. No other way of putting it.  Combination of timing with lights and the AI pathing the vehicles.\n\nConclusion:  If you are into building cities, Get this game.  Its relaxing, interesting, and stunning.  Be creative and be the next Robert Moses (New York), Hippodamus of Miletus (Ancient Greece), or Georges-Eugène Haussmann (Paris) of the modern world.","January 3","true","99.8"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","11","16","0","4"

You can get highest tier of city in no time, money is very easy to get and it becomes boring after a while. But the game itself is good. It's very friendly for mods(which are cool) you can make a nice city but i'm really missing a target in this game. someone could say that you don't need a target in game like that... well... true but if you played a very old game called City Life(there's a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ remake of it on steam) you know that trying to get everyone happy, employed and get every group of people is very fun. That game was making you strugle to get that 1% of snobs and so on. in Tropico 4 you also have targets and it makes it a fun game(would be pretty boring without it). so you get me by now. its just a pointless city builder. it's not even economical game(like a lot of city builders).

It's pretty hard not to make a comparison to EA/Maxis's SimCity 2013 here, because that is what this game looks like, but it feels so much better. The simulation is really solid. Traffic is awesome and your city can contain up to a million individuals that have an actual life-cycle. Features a really simple building and zoning system with excellent tools to make it how you want. Maps are huge and has water with real dynamics.\n\nAll this, on the Unity Engine, which is pretty amazing! Oh, and it comes with full modding support (w/Steam Workshop integration)!\n\nNow, It's not perfect and could use some improvments in some areas (see below), but I'm sure Colossal Order will provide us with plenty of updates and expansions in the coming future. This game is well worth the ~20EUR. There are hours and hours of fun here!\n\nWhat I did not like (this might change):\n- Bulldozer tool does not support destroying large areas, only one object at a time\n- Laying down water-pipes is kind of boring (Maybe I just got spoiled by SC2013 here)\n- Placing buildings on curved roads can be kind of hard in some cases\n- Placing down large intersections from assets kan be hard if the terrain is not perfectly straight\n- Placing roads straight relative to the border is really hard because the road does not snap (SC2013 had the Shift key for this)\n- The "Tutorial" you get when start the game is not that good\n- The "Tutorial" popus can get annoying\n- Music does not seem to be normalized, becoming way to loud in some sections\n\nWhat I liked:\n- Everything else","March 11, 2015","true","58.6"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

I like my city builders. And although Simcity 2013 had its flaws, it had many good things. For example, city specialization are good and graphics are really nice (except for the intersections.) All in all, Simcity 2013 is a great game with two major downfalls, traffic and map size.\n\nOn to Cities: Skylines. Traffic has been vastly improved on and map size is literally 9x that of Simcity; 25x with mods. Rather than paragraph form the good ♥♥♥♥ and bad ♥♥♥♥, here is a fancy list.\n\nPROS:\n\n- Map Size\n- Road System\n- Many building sizes\n- Better zoning system than Simcity.\n- Transit control\n- Difficulty. Getting a perfectly balanced city without issues is near impossible so lots of content.\n- As mentioned, lots of replay value.\n- Large community\n- Steam Workshop\n\n\nCONS:\n\n- Lack of bridge styles\n- Lack of building styles\n- Awkward park system; only way to make custom parks is via the asset editor (I think that's what it is called.)\n- Money made almost always is greater than money used.\n- No multiplayer (as of writing this. Maybe they'll add it?)\n\n\nOverall, 9.8/10.\n\nAs what everyone else has said, it's the game Simcity 2013 should've been and more. Had a great community and a great developer.

Every last citizen (or "Cim," in a nod to the Cities series' inspiration) is modeled; every last car or truck on the road carries a Cim or else cargo for a defined destination. Busses pull up, and individual Cims board and depart. They drive, take the train, or even walk to their destination. It is this level of detail that truly defines the transit side of the game: if one of your roads is clogged with congestion, there are very specific reasons why, and your options for dealing with it are vast. Add more roads? If so, which type? Would a bus line help? Probably not if it's all truck traffic; maybe a cargo train station? Hell, if it's all one factory that's causing the congestion, which can be checked by clicking on the individual trucks as they come and go, maybe you could even destroy the factory.\n\nBut outside of the transit side of things, the game is just ridiculously easy. As a veteran of SimCity 1 through 4, the defining challenge of that game -- the fact that you're always broke -- is gone here. My second city was generating such insane amounts of cash by the time it hit 10k citizens that money stopped being a factor altogether, letting me do completely insane things like putting entire interstate highway systems underground or putting subway stops in every insignificant little suburban area. Things like crime and health require very little attention to manage. Your town's buildings are apparently made of gasoline-soaked cardboard and are constantly catching fire, so you need something like 5 fire stations for every police station, but again it's not a big deal since money is a non-issue. Your city's expansion is limited by your ability to do all that tedious R/C/I zoning.\n\nWell, that and your ability to manage your city's transit. It's like all the rest of the game is just an excuse to frame the devs' real interest: creating an intricate transit simulation, with every last train, plane, ship, bus, truck, car and scooter simulated individually. So while the series pretends to be the offshoot of SimCity, it's actually the offshoot of Cities in Motion.\n\nBut whatever the shortcomings are, it's certainly better and far more fun than the dumpster fire known as the latest SimCity. Actually, I bet dumpster fires could be kind of fun IRL, but never mind.

Uncontrollable and just spreads everywere. Also no undo button for this (10/10 would have to make a new map 3 times).\n- The #use of #haschtags in #all the #tweets. @developers, please #reduce the amount of #haschtags thank #you #yoloswag.\n- No special districts for office zones (marketing, software, entrepreneurship etc.)\n- No actual Hadron colliders.\n- You not having it in your Steam library\n\nMy score  10/10\n\nMy necessary silly review quote:\nI renamed a guys car to "The Hippie Van" and watched his house burn down, probably because I doused his kitchen in gasoline.

The reason is simple: I was skeptical whether a team consists of roughly 10 people would be able to deliver a game matches its price. You know, think about EA's SimTown...And that infamous Cities XXXXXXXL...Not trying to make excuse anyway. Just don't want to be let down.\n\nAnd after log into the game and start playing, it's like time slitting away from my palm. Normally in SimTown as long as you cover the city limit with buildings there will not be much point keep playing on it and in Cities XXXXXXL long before that it's going to lag to unplayable. So generally I will not be absorbed in it and will eventually lose interest and get a life.\n\nHowever in Cities: Skylines I have already obtained "Metropolitan" title and the city just looks astounding. There are much, much more buildings in my metro than you can ever build in SimTown or Cities XXL, nevertheless the game is still smooth like hell. I mean it. I'm using a Core i5 and GForce 750M laptop and the fan is blazing, but any camera pan/ rotate will be in order immediately.\n\nThe mechanics is similar to simtown. Nothing can be blamed since simtown has already got a pretty good system, yet of course the bloody "seperate township“ has to be excluded. Notable differences include the induction of "Noise" and power grid, etc etc. The power grid system is a bit unrealistic since as long as your suburb is extended to the point you would like electricity to flow into you don't need to pull high-voltage wire to connect it to the power plant. Clearly it can not be achieved otherwise we'll not see utility poles around in our daily life.  (Sorry to be pedantic but I'm doing electrical engineering :(\n\nYou can open an economy panel and tune tax rate/ policies however this bit is oversimplified IMHO. For instance there is not much noticeable effect if you change the tax rate for houses except your income.\n\nThe graphic is not bad. You can complain it to be rough and undetailed, but I would rather want smoothness over a bit of detail, since with the game itself lag like s*** nobody will ever interested in zooming in to examine the minutiae of the city.\n\nTweeting system is freshening but annoying in late game. Developer might want to expand the dictionary.\n\nThis game is even equipped with a tool to form the terrain your city will be situated on. Even with a tool to enable importing of geographical data to automatically generate height offset! You know, I am currently using double screens, with google map on one screen and the game on the other, trying to create a city of Melbourne. And after terraforming, I am going to copy the city of Melbourne, street by street, building by building, onto it.\n\nWhat if you can't find the exact building in the game, you may ask.\n\nCreate it then. This game has building creation tool. Pretty much like it in Spore.\n\nSee, the replayability is vast. How amazing will it be, if you duplicate your hometown onto it, and do a bit of experiment on it maybe? Blast your home away from it? Merge this road with another to see the impact on traffic? Do whatever you like.

Its a simple concept but such an amazing game! The graphics are very good and the game itself is amazing, it's such a well executed game! It costs a lot but in some sales it goes down to arond£9.00, you can get it cheaper online though. Its very good as it doesn't force you to do anything, on your first city it gives you tips but in general they just leave you alone to play! Its quite realistic and has lots of ideas which you can relate to in the place you live. The new snowfall expansion is sounding very promising, released on 18 february! The after dark expansion is great, it doesn't add much for the price but adds a new element by adding the prison and taxi service. btw the after dark expansion doesn't add the day and night cycle, its already on the game. (it advertises this on its page!) I especially like trying to control the traffic as it is difficult to keep it flowing; if your traffic flows your city flows! Overall i really like this game and would recommend it to anyone who likes city builder games!\n\nI'd rate this game 89/100","February 17","true","54.6"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","8","11","0","0"

Unlike the latest SimCity, which was far too fantastical to let me build cities that resembled those in the real world (size limitations and not being able to establish proper zoning districts drove me crazy), this Colossal Order production nails just enough of what is fun about running a municipality in the real world. Proper zoning, room to grow, and the addition of policies and districts that let you plan out sensible city development make for a (mostly) bona fide experience in the virtual mayor's chair.\n\nMaking comparisons between games is not always helpful, but in this case, it's difficult to ignore the tight relationship between Cities: Skylines and its SimCity inspiration. Colossal Order delves deep into what Maxis and EA once made so popular with a traditional city-building approach. Few surprises or even significant innovations can be found here: There is just a standard single-player mode of play in which you choose from a handful of maps representing territory types ranging from flat plains to tropical beaches. You may also play the game with standard conditions, dial up the difficulty, and/or turn on sandbox and unlimited-money mods. No tutorial is included, either, which makes for a learning curve at the beginning. At least tips are provided on a continual basis during regular play.\n\nMultiplayer is totally absent, as are frilly options like disasters and giant monster attacks. There are no multiple-city games, either. You have one city to deal with, along with a mostly invisible outside world that allows you to buy and sell goods on a common market. The game has been developed with modding in mind, however, and it ships with a full editor. Therefore, you can expect a lot of user-made add-ons to hit the net shortly. Nonetheless, at the present time, this "just the facts" focus makes for an initially bland experience. The plainness is exacerbated by stark menu screens and dated visuals that are attractive enough to get by, while at the same time cutting corners by cloning buildings and signs, as well as lacking amenities like a day-night cycle and weather patterns.\n\nIf you have been jonesing to be a virtual mayor, though, Cities: Skylines gets nearly everything else just right. First off is zoning. You have full control over zoning neighborhoods as low or high (medium is absent, although I didn't miss it) residential, commercial, and industrial. These basic mechanics provide thorough control over laying out cities, which gives you a real sense of being in charge. Second up is map size, which allows for a lot of stretching out. The initial size is restrictive at 2km by 2km, but you can access more plots of land to eventually expand to a metropolis spanning a whopping 36 square km. That allows for expansive burgs, and an incredible sense of freedom. You always have room to correct mistakes and grow out of early problems, making you feel more like the super-mayor that you should feel like, and not the goofball constantly demolishing whole neighborhoods to fix problems you couldn't have foreseen three hours ago.\n\nTwo other great features involve establishing districts and policies. This allows for the creation of boroughs with separate identities (policies can be set to take in entire cities, as well) by drawing them out with the Paint District tool. If you want your very own Brooklyn hipsters or a hardhat neighborhood for factory Joes, you can paint out city blocks and then tweak localized settings. This allows you to offer free public transit, boost education, give away smoke detectors, get into high-tech homes, ban high rises, and even alter tax rates for different zones. You can also set up specific industrial areas to focus efforts there. So if you want a green city, allow only farming use in industrial zones. If you want to go in the other direction with the sort of hardcore factories that killed grandpa, you can set up oil or ore districts and watch the smokestacks pump out poison.\n\nPolicies are on the fanciful side, and establishing wildly different rules on social activities and even tax rates between neighborhoods in the same city will not go over well on election day. But I still love the ability to fine-tune cities without delving too deeply into micromanagement. The district and policy features combine to let me sketch out what I want in each part of my city--yes, this will be my gentrified borough for snotty white-collar professionals, complete with a smoking ban, no pets, no high rises, recycling, allowance for the use of certain controlled recreational substances, high-tech homes, and, of course, stupid high taxes--and then sit back and watch neighborhoods evolve.\n\nThe challenge is not pronounced, especially if you have city-building experience. You needn't worry about random sparks somehow taking down whole blocks, or other acts of God obliterating all of your hard work. This gives Cities: Skylines a relaxed character, instead of coming across like a rigorous game loaded with set objectives and problems to be solved. It's an old approach, but a great one, as it allows you to concentrate on the abstractions of building, instead of mindlessly racing around meeting random goals related to citizen happiness or residency numbers.\n\nThe only aspect of the game that becomes annoying to handle is transit. Given the same developer's Cities in Motion series, you might expect roads, buses, and the like to take on a vital role. Ultimately, however, transportation systems are overly Byzantine and convoluted, particularly when it comes to bus routes. It's difficult to tell if transportation woes are your own wrongdoing, or if there are problems with vehicle pathfinding in the game itself. You can muddle through, although you never exert the same level of control with transit as with everything else.\n\nNevertheless, Cities: Skylines is the best city-builder on the market right now. The game's presentation is stodgy, but it is all but guaranteed to provide you many hours of carefully crafting cities, laying out zoning, and establishing districts for specifics residential and industrial uses…all free from real-world mayoral headaches like 6 a.m. phone calls griping about snowplowing. Right now, there is no better way to take a peek at life as a mayor without filing your papers to run for office in the real world.","April 1, 2015","true","30.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

The only online aspect is the integration with Steam Workshop.\n-Deep modding. Game include's both a map editor and an asset editor. Workshop is already bursting at the seams with stuff.\n-Giantic room for constructing cities. You start with a single 2x2 km square, and you can eventually purchase 8 more squares. There's already mods allowing to purchase all 25 squares a map has (that's 100 sq km).\n-Cims (Skylines' version of Sims) are fully simulated and actually make sense.\n-Traffic simulation is incredibly deep (though there's still some issues with cars accumulating in a single lane sometimes).\n-No building upgrade.\n-Specialization is not as deep as in SimCity, but the District system allows you to essentially create individual cities within the same map, with their own laws, taxes, and industrial focuses.\n-Several info overlays are almost copied from SimCity, even in their presentation.\n-Skylines is less colourful than SimCity, but also a bit more realistic.\n-Music isn't bad in Skylines, but SimCity's better.\n\nCompared to Cities XL\n-Map are just a little bit smaller (Cities XL has 110 sq km, Skylines has 100 sq km with mods, 36 sq km without).\n-Zoning is much, more comfortable, particularly with curved roads.\n-No lag (although large cities can be taxing depending on your computer). Brisk road building even for huge tracks.\n-Graphics are somewhat similar.\n-Interface is far more user-friendly.\n-Traffic simulation is orders of magnitude more interesting.\n-Road variety is more or less the same (just in terms of types. Skylines' free-form roadbuilding allows for pretty much unlimited road-building methods).\n-So far, I've encountered not a single memory leak or similarly wrecking bug.\n\nOverall, the game is great. It is true it is in some aspects less deep than SimCity 4 and it does have some usability nuances (such as zoning not always looking exactly the way you want, though this is the price we pay for free-form orientation, I suppose), but it does so much stuff so great that you quickly let that pass. Traffic itself is so well done that it becomes a game unto itself (which is no wonder, considering the game was developed by the same people behind Cities in Motion).\n\nModding support is also excellent. Though the base game comes with a somewhat limited variety of buildings, ten minutes in the Workshop will land you with several dozen new structures that will seamless integrate into your cities, and new stuff is being made faster than we can check it.\n\nSome of the missing stuff, such as tunnels, is already being considered as free DLCs in the near future.\n\n10/10 game. This is both the citibuilder we wanted and the citibuilder we deserved.","March 15, 2015","true","100.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Right now, there is no better way to take a peek at life as a mayor without filing your papers to run for office in the real world.","April 1, 2015","true","30.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/topperfalkon/recommended/255710/","topperfalkon","Topperfalkon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/topperfalkon/","1676 products in account","It's perhaps easy to see how Cities: Skylines has done so well, considering the failure SimCity 2013 was.\n\nI've played SimCity 2013 and Cities XL (not their latest iteration), but so far I consider Skylines to be a far better City Builder.\n\nSimCity got a hard rap for the online-only requirement, followed by a week of connectivity issues post-launch. The shame of this was that it detracted from an actually rather good simulator mixing challenges with creativity.\n\nSkylines has no multiplayer element, so likewise there are no weird online-only requirements. There are a bunch of available regions to start off in, each with differing amounts of available land and resources. When you start your game, you'll be presented with a highway connection and a basic guide to get you started, similar to other city builders. The game unlocks more tools as your population increases, making sure that you don't overbuild when your city is young. For the most part, all of these features are identical to other city builders.\n\nWhere Skylines differs are the range of public transport available, and how they work. You can set up individual train lines, metro lines, and bus lines. This isn't a surprise, given that the game comes from the same team that developed Cities in Motion.\nOne of the most interesting features I've experienced in the game so far is their water flow modelling. You start off having to place water pumps and sewage outflows into your nearest water source. However for rivers this means that you need to build your pump upstream of your sewage to avoid poisoning your population.\nWhere it gets even more interesting is when you build hydroelectric dams. These dams will have a variable rate of power production based on the strength of the river it's blocking. Building a dam also has an interesting side effect; it causes the water level upstream of the dam to rise, which makes it really easy to flood your city if you're not careful. It's not something I've experienced in a game before. Oh, the game also lets you decide what side of the road your people drive on, which is a first as far as I know.\n\nThis leads me on to some of my frustrations with this game. There's currently no option for terraforming an active city (as far as I can tell), which means that making flood-preventing earthworks is currently impossible. Likewise, thngs like road tunnels are completely missing from the game as well, although the developers have said these will be planned as part of a free update. It'd also be nice to have some better info overlays around road usage, as by far the biggest challenge in this game, like many other city sims, is dealing with traffic flow around the city. As an aside, it would be nice for one of these games someday to allow us to try out different junction types.\n\nHowever, by far the stand-out boon for this game is it's excellent Workshop support, which has already seen thousands of submissions in the short time the game has been avaiable, including contributions from the occasional former Maxis employee. I spent yesterday being captivated by a selection of highway interchanges by some dude in Germany (I think),  that's no joke. I could easily spend more time in the Workshop than the game itself, there's so much to see.\n\nThe game was made by Colossal Order, but it's under the stewardship of Paradox Games. Given the game's success so far, it seems like this game will more than likely recieve plenty of support for years to come, with expansions and DLC being provided in a CK2 style, along with free updates and the like.\n\nSummary\nPros:\n+ Familiar city builder style, mixed with some novel public transport and water features\n+ No crazy online-only requirements\n+ Excellent Workshop support\n+ Its current success ensures it'll be well supported for some time\n+ Cheaper than Cities XXL now, cheaper than SimCity when SC was released\n\nCons:\n- No obvious ability to terraform, making flood defences impossible\n- No ability to create tunnels limits road options or the ability to create tunnels under water bodies\n- Not as many features or items as other city builders, which might reduce effective play time.\n\n\nVerdict:\nHonestly, at this price I have to recommend this game to anyone who enjoys city builders. It may not have quite the same number of features as other games, but the mod support means there's more than enough stuff you can add to the game until the first round of content updates start coming to keep you going.","March 22, 2015","true","56.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/welcomeaboardmate/recommended/255710/","welcomeaboardmate","BlackEagle","http://steamcommunity.com/id/welcomeaboardmate/","501 products in account","If you're one of those people whom, like me, was let down by the release of SimCity 2013, this game is for you.\n\nIf you're one of those people whom was pleased with SimCity 2013, this game is for you.\n\nIf you enjoy city builders, THIS GAME IS FOR YOU.\n\nLet's begin.\n\n\nFirst, why is this game for those of us let down by simcity 2013?\n\nThis game harnesses what made the older simcity games great and adds on to it the way I expect a sequel should have added on to the previous major installment, SimCity 4. There is no online DRM whatsoever, the map sizes are initially restricted to a 2x2 km square like SC 2013 but can be expanded up to 6x6 in any arrangement, or modded to 10x10 km (25 plots of 2x2 land). That's a lot. That even matches up with the "huge" cities XL franchise, and I feel like it may even surpass it at times as ALL maps are capable of reaching this size.\nThis game brings back features that some may like, some may not - power lines, water pipes, some of the busywork we found ourselves doing in older simcity games. Despite having no in-game terraforming, the game does have a map editor that uses easy-to-use terraforming-style tools you would use in simcity games, as well as supporting heightmap importing and exporting allowing you to easily create real world locations to build in, or make your own and export them to the steam workshop for others to enjoy. An asset editor, much like the old urban renewal kits, allows you to modify buildings or add new ones, as well as upload them to the steam workshop again or download ones others have made.\nAs far as straight up gameplay features, you will be happy to see the return of mass transit on a large scale that SimCity 2013 removed most of. You'll have trains, boats, planes, buses, subways, and highways to manage, as well as being able to create lines for each that add to the realism and also control of the game rather than plopping stops and letting the mass transit roam free. You'll also find that while there is no regional play, you instead have cities within cities - districts, you can say. Each can have their own ordinances/policies, their own tax rates, and be specialized differently than other districts or the rest of the city. Zones find the addition of a new type of zone, Offices, which act as a form of clean industrial zone. You'll also find yourself now dealing with the dead, and having cemeteries and crematoriums to send them to.\n\n\nWhy is this game for those of you that LIKED simcity 2013?  (repeats a bit)\n\nFirst of all, the graphics in SimCity 2013 were without doubt the greatest a city builder has ever seen. This game matches, and in some ways, surpasses what SimCity 2013 was capable of in the graphical department. You keep the tilt-shift effect which appears to have been improved, and texture work is beyond amazing.\nNow, you won't be finding any multiplayer or regional play in this game. However, what you WILL find is mods. A lot of mods. Hundreds of mods, maps, and addons on the steam workshop already at the time of this review. They're easy to obtain, and you can turn them on or off within the game itself. You'll also notice map sizes are far bigger, which means you have so much room you can effectivelly still do your regional play - cities the size of that in SimCity 2013 were 2x2 km in size, and this game allows you to get 9 such plots by default, 25 plots with a mod. That's 25 spaces that could be used however you want, all linked to one another not by a preset highway, but by you and how you want them to be connected. It's also likely that anyone who's played SimCity 2013 has played a previous simcity, and you will find every feature of those old games - minus the regional play and neighbor deals as a direct result - in here. You will also still find city specialization in a different style than that of SC2013. Rather than placing individual buildings, you will instead create districts (cities within cities, each having their own taxes and ordinances/policies) and specialize them to agriculture, oil drilling, ore mining, or forestry. The industrial zones you place within these districts will then switch to utilize your chosen specialization, replacing their buildings with ones suited for what you want. This allows you to create far bigger specialized areas, and far quicker and with more ease. In the event you require resources that would otherwise be extracted from these specializations, such as to run coal or oil power plants, they will be automatically imported through trains, boats, planes, or simple road at no extra cost to you - just keep the traffic flowing so the delivery trucks can reach their destination.\nIf this sounds easy, it's not. This game can bite you alive several hours in. You will find it far more challenging than simcity 2013 or cities XL ever has been, and that's without activating the built-in hard mode mod. At first, it will be easy - that's due to you building in a small area of land with limited building availability. It's when everything is unlocked and you're sitting there with 100,000 fully simulated citizens running around their daily lives that all hell crumbles down on you.\n\n\nDo you enjoy city builders? You play tropico, or cities XL, etc? Play this.\n\nI'm going to skip the basic stuff and say it straight forward. Anything you can do in Cities XL or Tropico (in regards to city building, I'm aware tropico has dictator stuff going on that you won't find here), you are more than capable of doing here in a much easier way. You have more control over customization, more control over the city, and all taking place in a game that looks better and has one of the best developers and publishers out there at your back for support with the steam workshop throwing hundreds at the time of this review, THOUSANDS in the near future, of mods, maps, and addons in your direction to play with as well as letting you make your OWN with ease. That is all.\n\nI grew up playing SimCity, and soon found myself playing other city builders in the form of Tropico and City Life. Cities XL was a game I tried to like and just couldn't due to how unplayable it was, and tropico is re-releasing a similar game every year with little effort to innovate anymore like PopTop used to back in the day. SimCity 2013 looked promising in trailers, but upon its' release I tried my hardest to like it with 130 hours of game time but I could not make myself like it. It was simply too small scale and too easy, and I just missed everything you could do with the older simcity games. Modding was so easy for SimCity 4, and the cities were so much more fun to make, that upon going back I wondered why I had ever tried to like SimCity 2013 in the first place. I even dug up my old SimCity 2000 and 3000 discs and got those running, and since I'm not old enough to have experienced SimCity for the SNES when it initially came out, even got myself a cartridge for that off of amazon and gave it a whirl. Each gave me hours and hours of enjoyment that 2013's verison never could. Cities Skylines I was rather worried about actually, as I thought they would focus too much on fixing the city sizes and offline to actually add anything worthwhile or fun beyond that and this game would end up along the lines of Cities XL for production value. I have never been more wrong and I am really, REALLY pleased to say that. I owe an absolutely massive thank you to Colossal and Paradox for making this game in such a fantastic state. They have managed to bring a childhood game back for many of us in a fantastic way.\n\nThis is the greatest city builder in over a decade to be released. Colossal Order and Paradox Interactive have stated that more content and updates are going to be on our way for years to come, so we can only expect it to get better from here. Also, did you notice the game is only $30? Why are you still reading this...\n\nGO AND BUY THE GAME ALREADY!\n\nRecommend: YES. YES. YES. SO MUCH YES.","March 16, 2015","true","76.8"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

My own highlights:\n\n* Complete design freedom: if you can think about it, you can make it in the game. The game doesn't offer what you want to do? There's probably a mod for it in the Steam Workshop; if there isn't, you can easily make one and share it with all other players!\n* The best traffic simulation I've ever seen in a city management game.\n* Gorgeous graphics.\n* Cross-platform: Windows, Mac and Linux compatible.\n\nWhy are you still here?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/welcomeaboardmate/recommended/255710/","welcomeaboardmate","BlackEagle","http://steamcommunity.com/id/welcomeaboardmate/","501 products in account","If you're one of those people whom, like me, was let down by the release of SimCity 2013, this game is for you.\n\nIf you're one of those people whom was pleased with SimCity 2013, this game is for you.\n\nIf you enjoy city builders, THIS GAME IS FOR YOU.\n\nLet's begin.\n\n\nFirst, why is this game for those of us let down by simcity 2013?\n\nThis game harnesses what made the older simcity games great and adds on to it the way I expect a sequel should have added on to the previous major installment, SimCity 4. There is no online DRM whatsoever, the map sizes are initially restricted to a 2x2 km square like SC 2013 but can be expanded up to 6x6 in any arrangement, or modded to 10x10 km (25 plots of 2x2 land). That's a lot. That even matches up with the "huge" cities XL franchise, and I feel like it may even surpass it at times as ALL maps are capable of reaching this size.\nThis game brings back features that some may like, some may not - power lines, water pipes, some of the busywork we found ourselves doing in older simcity games. Despite having no in-game terraforming, the game does have a map editor that uses easy-to-use terraforming-style tools you would use in simcity games, as well as supporting heightmap importing and exporting allowing you to easily create real world locations to build in, or make your own and export them to the steam workshop for others to enjoy. An asset editor, much like the old urban renewal kits, allows you to modify buildings or add new ones, as well as upload them to the steam workshop again or download ones others have made.\nAs far as straight up gameplay features, you will be happy to see the return of mass transit on a large scale that SimCity 2013 removed most of. You'll have trains, boats, planes, buses, subways, and highways to manage, as well as being able to create lines for each that add to the realism and also control of the game rather than plopping stops and letting the mass transit roam free. You'll also find that while there is no regional play, you instead have cities within cities - districts, you can say. Each can have their own ordinances/policies, their own tax rates, and be specialized differently than other districts or the rest of the city. Zones find the addition of a new type of zone, Offices, which act as a form of clean industrial zone. You'll also find yourself now dealing with the dead, and having cemeteries and crematoriums to send them to.\n\n\nWhy is this game for those of you that LIKED simcity 2013?  (repeats a bit)\n\nFirst of all, the graphics in SimCity 2013 were without doubt the greatest a city builder has ever seen. This game matches, and in some ways, surpasses what SimCity 2013 was capable of in the graphical department. You keep the tilt-shift effect which appears to have been improved, and texture work is beyond amazing.\nNow, you won't be finding any multiplayer or regional play in this game. However, what you WILL find is mods. A lot of mods. Hundreds of mods, maps, and addons on the steam workshop already at the time of this review. They're easy to obtain, and you can turn them on or off within the game itself. You'll also notice map sizes are far bigger, which means you have so much room you can effectivelly still do your regional play - cities the size of that in SimCity 2013 were 2x2 km in size, and this game allows you to get 9 such plots by default, 25 plots with a mod. That's 25 spaces that could be used however you want, all linked to one another not by a preset highway, but by you and how you want them to be connected. It's also likely that anyone who's played SimCity 2013 has played a previous simcity, and you will find every feature of those old games - minus the regional play and neighbor deals as a direct result - in here. You will also still find city specialization in a different style than that of SC2013. Rather than placing individual buildings, you will instead create districts (cities within cities, each having their own taxes and ordinances/policies) and specialize them to agriculture, oil drilling, ore mining, or forestry. The industrial zones you place within these districts will then switch to utilize your chosen specialization, replacing their buildings with ones suited for what you want. This allows you to create far bigger specialized areas, and far quicker and with more ease. In the event you require resources that would otherwise be extracted from these specializations, such as to run coal or oil power plants, they will be automatically imported through trains, boats, planes, or simple road at no extra cost to you - just keep the traffic flowing so the delivery trucks can reach their destination.\nIf this sounds easy, it's not. This game can bite you alive several hours in. You will find it far more challenging than simcity 2013 or cities XL ever has been, and that's without activating the built-in hard mode mod. At first, it will be easy - that's due to you building in a small area of land with limited building availability. It's when everything is unlocked and you're sitting there with 100,000 fully simulated citizens running around their daily lives that all hell crumbles down on you.\n\n\nDo you enjoy city builders? You play tropico, or cities XL, etc? Play this.\n\nI'm going to skip the basic stuff and say it straight forward. Anything you can do in Cities XL or Tropico (in regards to city building, I'm aware tropico has dictator stuff going on that you won't find here), you are more than capable of doing here in a much easier way. You have more control over customization, more control over the city, and all taking place in a game that looks better and has one of the best developers and publishers out there at your back for support with the steam workshop throwing hundreds at the time of this review, THOUSANDS in the near future, of mods, maps, and addons in your direction to play with as well as letting you make your OWN with ease. That is all.\n\nI grew up playing SimCity, and soon found myself playing other city builders in the form of Tropico and City Life. Cities XL was a game I tried to like and just couldn't due to how unplayable it was, and tropico is re-releasing a similar game every year with little effort to innovate anymore like PopTop used to back in the day. SimCity 2013 looked promising in trailers, but upon its' release I tried my hardest to like it with 130 hours of game time but I could not make myself like it. It was simply too small scale and too easy, and I just missed everything you could do with the older simcity games. Modding was so easy for SimCity 4, and the cities were so much more fun to make, that upon going back I wondered why I had ever tried to like SimCity 2013 in the first place. I even dug up my old SimCity 2000 and 3000 discs and got those running, and since I'm not old enough to have experienced SimCity for the SNES when it initially came out, even got myself a cartridge for that off of amazon and gave it a whirl. Each gave me hours and hours of enjoyment that 2013's verison never could. Cities Skylines I was rather worried about actually, as I thought they would focus too much on fixing the city sizes and offline to actually add anything worthwhile or fun beyond that and this game would end up along the lines of Cities XL for production value. I have never been more wrong and I am really, REALLY pleased to say that. I owe an absolutely massive thank you to Colossal and Paradox for making this game in such a fantastic state. They have managed to bring a childhood game back for many of us in a fantastic way.\n\nThis is the greatest city builder in over a decade to be released. Colossal Order and Paradox Interactive have stated that more content and updates are going to be on our way for years to come, so we can only expect it to get better from here. Also, did you notice the game is only $30? Why are you still reading this...\n\nGO AND BUY THE GAME ALREADY!\n\nRecommend: YES. YES. YES. SO MUCH YES.","March 16, 2015","true","76.8"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Furthermore, the sheer fact that it was a city builder and being aware how good Cities in Motion 2 was (350+ hrs I've put into it...) I was extremely excited but I guess you could say I was a bit aprehensive too.\n\nThat apprehension is long gone.  This game is an instant classic, on par with the likes of SimCity 4.  Let me tell you why;\n\nBuilt to be moddable, at the time of writing (72hrs post release), there has been a staggering 6000 submissions to the Steam Workshop with some fairly advanced mods, it's not just the cosmetics.\nNo more towns- up to 1,000,000 people can be simulated.  They all have their own homes, workpalces and families.  No more GlasBox nonsense from EA here, this is the real thing.\nExtremely accessible, with more advanced and micro-management available but slightly hidden away so that it's not intimidating\nDid I mention this was made by just 19 people?\nThere are obviously some minor hiccups here, nowhere near as bad as SimCity and no DRM or online nonsense either.  Day/Night cycles are gone and so are tunnels but the latter has already been planned as the first FREE DLC for Cities: Skylines.  Also, seeing as CO are a small team, the mod community are working tirelessly to work on the superb foundation CO have set for us - the vanila expereince is amazing but the sheer flexibility and moddability of this game will see this title have a life cycle similar to that of Sim City.

Game starts as expected. Build some roads, electric, water, and zones.  Bulldozing gives money back instead of costing money.\n\nYou don't spend money to zone or re-zone.  You can easily lose if you screw up this part. A second failure point that can crop up at this stage is placing something now that creates a pollution hub later.\n\n2. There is a lot to manage but you start small - then as you get bigger, the more you need to manage. Progression feels good and appropriate for a game in this genre. Pacing is also smooth. The Pace is dictated by Milestones, as you reach certain goals in the game you get to purchase more land, unlock buildings and more upgrades.\n\n3.  Mods in this game are pretty good in their potential.  Anyone can make Assets or Maps.\n\n4. There is enough to simulate to entertain you but there isn't too much depth.  The level of depth feels appropriate.  Not dumbed down by any means.\n\n5. Lots of potential room for DLC, Expansions and more content WITHOUT being stripped down to nothing.  This is not a half-game awaiting the rest in microtransactions.\n\nCON: No big flaws yet.\n\n1. Some parts of the UI are primitive.  When you click to view Energy, Waste, Fire or Crime, it doesn't tell you how much money you are spending on it. So there is some juggling of one tab to the next.\n\n2. You cannot move or re-size the windows that open for you when you click buttons.\n\n3. The music could have a better presence.  It is a bit quiet and often I hear nothing but birds.\n\n4. "Forced" to start small and build big from scratch.  You "can cheat" if you like, but playing without cheats you cannot just start building a large city. Some people might dislike having the same starting situation evey single time on terms of what you can build and how you advance.\n\nLinear Progression is the rule of this Sandbox.  Fortunately, you can advance in a non-linear way.\n\nOverall:  9/10.  The only thing that could have made this game better is to have more control over the size of Zones - the "Zones" appear next to road types when you build roads. You don't place "zones." Once the road is placed and the "Zone Spot" appears next to the road, you may designate that as Residential, Commercial or Industial.\n\nThis is the best City Builder on the market, period.","March 10, 2015","true","365.3"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","0"

They have made the game wonderfully accessible and deceptively deep if you love the micromanagement side. I won’t list what this game does right and what others fail to do as others already have, all I will say is this game is well worth your time.\n\nSide note It amazes me how a small team of six (I believe fourteen now) can make this wonderful gem of a game that will no doubt become the next pillar for city builders meanwhile at EA and Maxis they mess up so badly.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Mittsies/recommended/255710/","Mittsies","Mittsies","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Mittsies/","72 products in account","Cities Skyline is a great game if you like to build modern cities. The road system is incredibly well done. I like how they chose to link zones directly to roads. Everything feels neat and clean. It has in-game tools for creating your own maps and game assets. You can create, for instance, a custom power plant with your own model or build it out of pre-existing models and determine it's stats such as cost and power output. Best of all your creations can easily be posted to the steam workshop and the game is incredibly mod-friendly. I like almost everything about the game; in fact my only major complaint is that the game is too easy.\n\nIt's virtually impossible to "lose" at cities skylines. Even if you play like a complete idiot, going bankrupt is very rare unless you want it to happen. You can just have insanely high tax rates and let people move in, get totally reamed, leave angrily only to come back later. You could be the worst mayor who ever lived and make millions with ease. With the exception of losing a valuable structure to a fire or something, there's virtually no consenquences to anything you do. Some might say it's not about winning or losing, aiming instead for effeciency, but there's a fine line between "min-maxing" (making your city as effective as you can) and having no challenge whatsoever.\n\nSim City 3000, for instance, was much harder to get into the green; requiring you carefully plan your city or to plague it with casinos and toxic waste dumps (which were unique buildings you can only build when given the opprotunity to do so) in order to get ahead. Whenever you had enough money to build something big, it really mattered. You had to decide if you wanted a new hospital or some reinforcement to your educational system - and if you would have enough income to support your new object. Expanding your city size and adding more zones was also a very careful decision players made in Sim3K, because if you could not adequately support a new burst of population it could mean trouble. There were legitimate consequences to your actions - cranking up tax rates won't just make people leave, they will riot and start fires. Even with Skyline's "hard" mode which is tucked away as an optional mod you can turn on (right next to infinite money) the game feels way too simple at times.\n\nUltimately if you just wanna mess around and build stuff, Skylines is obviously a massive upgrade to the original sim games - but it's kind of terrible as an actual game that imposes challenges and problems you have to overcome. With modding, though, I'm sure the community could find a way to make the game more difficult. The game has a good soundtrack (pretty sure I hear some references to older SimCity music in there, too), cozy aesthetics and enough variety to keep most players entertained for at least 20 to 30 hours. Definitely a good purchase for both people who like city builders and those who are new to the genre.\n\nRating: B+\nPS: Death to chirper.","March 17, 2015","true","19.4"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","6","8","0","2"

I even remember the teacher showing kids how to play the game.  What better way to teach kids the value of well funded schools?\n\nThis game exists mostly because under the ownership of EA the Simcity series has really faltered.  Major technical issues and limitations and lost opportunities and hurt the series.\n\nThis game is easy, much easier than any Simcity game I’ve played.  Some of it is easier because things just work better, like the water pipe systems.  The economics are just a lot easier.  I actually think this is more realistic.  I live in California, and here government funding isn’t really an issue, the issue is that throwing money at problems doesn't really help a lot.  Traffic isn’t an issue of money, it's an issue of what to do.  Same goes for crime, education, and especially water, or even pollution.  City skylines emulates this, money isn’t a big problem, but planning and management is the heart of the challenge.\n\nPros\nGreat aesthetics.  Night time is absolutely beautiful. The city looks great.\nSo many options as far as roads, zoning, utilities, really fun variety.\nI like the easy economics which let you just focus on city building.\nSteam workshop and lots of mods.\nThe size of the maps is amazing.  As your city grows you will unlock more and more land, faster than you could fill it.  It really puts Simcity franchise to shame.\nCons\nIt's going to push your system a little bit, but luckily frame rate isn't super important in this genre.\nThe mass transit bus/train stop system with routes feels a little clunky and odd to me.","December 3, 2015","true","12.2"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","0"

It reminds me Sim City 4, but with modern improvements! It is easy to play, and the game explains the core concepts as you go.  This is the city builder that we have been waiting for. Click Add to cart, now.\n\nBefore I describe the game, I have had absolutely no choppiness and I have the game maxed out.  If you have a quality PC you should have no issues running this game.\n\nYou have 9 different maps to choose from.  There is no random map option, but there is an editor included that you can create your own maps or download maps from other players. So, you will always have new maps to play on.\n\nThe game has a few interesting subsystems that work together.  The more educated your citizens are, the less trash they will produce.  Poorer the neighborhood will lead to more crime.  You have to keep your pollution levels down or you could risk tainting the drinking water of your citizens.\n\nThere are multiple road options to allow you to truly customize the shape and direction of your town.\n\nDo you want to build a eco friendly paradise or do you want to build the biggest city that you can? The game gives you the tools for you to decide. Also, with the editors available there should be plenty of options coming from other players.\n\nFor the old timers who remember Sim City on the SNES (I know it was PC first, but back then a SNES was a few hundred dollars and PC's were $2,000 easy) for everytime you reach a population milestone you level up your ability to add items to your city.","March 10, 2015","true","32.8"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","9","14","0","0"

The problem is: there's no challenge. Sure, there are the usual problems with traffic, but any of those problems are made by the player, not that the game tosses a wrench into the machinery. You don't even have the usual problems with pollution or disgruntled people, because as long as there is a pretty even mix between industry, residential and commercial zones with a park or two placed, no one will ever be unhappy - I even got a prize for the most beautiful city, and I didn't even aim for that - I just plonked down a couple of parks.\n\nThe graphics is fantastic, the music fine and the sounds... kind of annoying, especially the sirens that you will hear a lot. There are no bugs that I can think of, so technically speaking, this is an awesome game, but only if you don't want to be challenged, just building a city.

Start out with a small town town, slowly build it up, generate funds and expand your city. The game is immersive straight off the bat, with a gental learning curve. It's the sort of game that will suck you right in, with hours going by without you noticing it. You'll spend your day thinking about modifications you're going to make when you get home. It's really that good.\n\nThe game works by permitting development through the zoning of land. Different zones will permit different kinds of development. It's all held together by a road network (and later on a subway/train/plane network) that you'll constantly have to plan for and tweak. Services such as sewerage, water, electricity as well as services such as garbage, police, firefighters, ambulances, morgues, parks and education are all accounted for. It's a game of balance, a bit of that here a bit of that there. As the City grows, the game rewards you with more zones, services, buildings, etc, slowly dripping you the goodies as you progress rather than overwhelming you at the start.\n\nThe game is super accessible, and whilst punishing earlier on, is rather easy once the ball gets rolling. My girlfriend had a go and succsesfully set up a city on her own.\n\nWhilst the game is super amazing, like every game it has it's minor problems. There is a lack of an endgame. Once you hit a certain point, it feels almost like a last section of the game is missing. Super high residential, mega-matropolis expansion pack please, with plenty more features! Furthermore, whilst I view the easy difficulty as a positive, many will feel the lack of challenge once the money starts to roll in. Roads play an important part of the game, but feel very volatile and hit/miss when placing them in complicated patterns.

It's everything Simcity looked like it should have been.\n\nThe entire city you manage is persistant and constantly evolving, meaning- people live, work, and commute to the same places in the same vehicle every day (you can click on cars and see who owns them!). and even eventually have familes and die. The game can be as simple, or as complex as you want, with the ability to create districts which allow you to set individual laws and regulations, turning industrial zones into farming areas with low taxes, residential into luxury apartments with high taxes, or specialized industy areas to gather resources like oil, coal, and wood (yes, forestry is a thing in this). Not to mention, EVERYTHING is renamable; Districts, people, and buildings.\n\nAnd buildings. You can't forget about the fact that you can MAKE and SHARE buildings, parks, and even maps with powerful, but easy to use in game asset editors. Its easy to go to the workshop, grab some maps, buildings, or lots you like and add them to your game!\n\nPlacement of buildings is also important. A lot of buildings will create polution- but not just the regular type you would expect like smog and soil polution- many buildings will also create noise polution, and make people living near them very upset.\n\nIt's like they took all the best features from the -old- simcity games (water pipes and power lines YAY!), re-engineered them, put their own twist on some things, and made a beautiful game out of it. Incredibly happy with this purchase, especially considering the wonderfully reasonable price. WHY ARE YOU STILL READING THIS!?

Cities: Skylines doesn't try to do any fancy new tricks like multiplayer or city connections. Instead it's an oldschool city builder game that we all love and it looks great.\n\nThe game is already great as it is, but with any future DLC or expansion it will become even better. While I'm usually not a huge one of DLC's, I really like the way Paradox releases them. Every DLC seems worth the money as there a good amount of new content and they often include some of the stuff in free patch also. So while the game in my opinion is already the best city builder game to day, there's is so much more potential to it.\n\nParadox is also known for their great support for modding and Cities: Skylines is not an expectation. If something is not in the game you can always make it yourself and there's a good change that someone has already done it. With the great modding support the game has nearly endless amount of potential so it will only get better as the time goes by. Just like SimCity 4 did back in the days.\n\nSo if you are into the city building games, but you were disappointed with the crappy SimCity or/and the scam Cities XXL, then this is the game for you.  I can highly recommend the game for anyone who's interested of the games of this genre. It's by far the best one and will only get better.","March 13, 2015","true","65.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It clearly takes its inspiration from both classic Sim City and the recent Sim City 2013, however, it ends up being something really quite special.\n\nThe simulation is really robust. I've yet to find any major problems and/or bugs. My cities have had issues but they've all been the result of my poor planning, and with a little thought and re-working I have managed to fix them and learn from my mistakes in a way that is very satisfying. The depth of simulation vs. abstraction is also great. Some things, such as wind-drection and night/day cycles are missing but they don't have any noticable impact on the gameplay once you are involved.\n\nI think that the lack of need for a tutorial speaks volumes too. The game just makes sense. You can bring your real-life knowledge of how towns and cities are set up here along with a healthy dose of common sense and you will succeed. The result is the feeling that you really are creating and overseeing a living community rather than simply gaming a system which is fantastic.\n\nOver all, I really recommend this game to anyone that has even a passing interest in city building games. Its by far the best option on the market now, and its going to take something pretty special to beat it any time soon.\n\n","March 14, 2015","true","101.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Where you got all of the bad stuff from SC5, Skylines has improved it to where it works.\n\nI am not writing this to badmouth SC5, I spent hundreds of hours playing it and enjoyed it for the most part except for the major concerns players had:\n\nNo single highway in/out of your city causing major traffic bottlenecks.  The game allows you to expand your city to larger areas (Major concern of SC5 players).  The game includes Metro stations unlike SC5.  As far as public transportation you can not only place them but plan their routes like Cities in Motion.\n\nWhen you build roadways it will grid out exactly the depth of your city buildings construction of what you zone next to the road.  The highways are reconstructable to your liking.  The road tool to create curved roads was a little bit confusing on how to make the desired curved effect at first, but after a little while of experimenting it is not difficult and a much stronger mechanic then SC5.\n\nThe thing I like the most is you are unable to construct High Density areas right at start.  You must start with Low Density and earn by population growth the higher density/metropolis buildings expected to see in a major city vs. a small town, i.e. small towns don't have nuclear power plants.  Civs will sort of trickle into your city little by little instead of having a massive population boom which undercuts your public services.\n\nAll in all it is exactly what everyone was hoping for from SC5.\n\nFor all the DLC complainers, I also own SC5 Cities of Tomorrow and found that enjoyable with all its problems, although I won't buy any more SC5 DLC's, if Skylines releases any DLC's I will be purchasing them as the developers obviously have learned from the catastrophic release of SC5 online play is not required.\n\n","March 19, 2015","true","58.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Especially traffic management. Although the game is meant to be a successor to Simcity 4 and an epic "take that" at Simcity 5, it's more of an expansion pack for Cities in Motion 2 since you'll be spending most of your time building costly road layouts and alleviating impossibly-complex traffic grimlocks originating from said road layouts. Thankfully this time you have a proper user-friendly GUI and grid/non-grid transition system to assist you when placing and aligning splines according to your OCD level. Be sure to always focus on transit-oriented development rather than classic suburban sprawl as this game is almost completely Northwest Euro-centric in nature.\n\nCompared to SC4 though, many vital elements are either oversimplified or nonexistent; whilst new concepts such as sewage disposal are shoved up your ♥♥♥ without regard to any learning curve, and normally mundane tasks become so overpowered such that it's an instant game-over if your rubbish trucks are too slow. (No, seriously.) Starting a new town, however, is considerably less tedious as there are in-built milestones to restrict asset requirements to your population growth level. But ultimately, this game is set in the present day, when your cims expect everything from power to water and even Internet services from the moment you zone your first residential area and have nearly zero tolerance or grace period for any unfortunate events; so treat all your peepur like stereotypical teenage white girls at all times or it's express bankruptcy for you. Whether take this as a challenge or setback, your mileage may vary. Interesting new features like fluid mechanics and restricted aviation pathways also help to determine your final city layout, reducing the monotony of the mid-game era.\n\nPersonally, I feel that Colossal Order have definitely learnt from most of their mistakes committed in CIM2; whether or not Paradox published games' infamous DLC-spam policy also applies to this release is yet to be confirmed. Many of the other "overwhelmingly positive" reviews seem to be rants from starved city-building fanboys and SC5 haters who long-awaited a player-friendly magnum opus of the genre, praising CSL for the messianic role it plays in the wake of SC5's epic failure with little thought about the potential shortcomings of this hastily-released masterpiece. Even though flaws in the Unity Engine's ability to cope with the game design remain evident, it's clear why this game broke 1,000,000 purchases in about the time it took for Gangnam Style views to hit 100 times that number.

I bought this game for my wife initially, but also bought a copy for myself just because it's Paradox and I'm a fan of their strategy games. I didn't think I'd play C:S beyond five hours or so just to check it out, but here I am, a full weekend later, with my first Megalopolis of 50.000 inhabitants. I've been spending fourty hours with this gem of a game since thursday and over the weekend and it's earned a place in my heart. It wasn't my kind of game, I thought.\n\nIt's not very hard, nor very challenging, which I initially thought was a balance issue and was disappointed in, But great disastrous challenges are not the point with this game. I can spend half an hour just planning the perfect intersection to make traffic flow seamlessly, or try to boost the productivity of my industrial zones. The great challenges are in the fine details. It's genius. The game wouldn't be half as fun with masses of city-threatening challenges to be dealt with while I'm trying to design the next suburbs.\n\nThe game flows superbly. Fourty hours of playing and I haven't had a single crash, nor the simplest notion of lag although my city is getting very large with lots of traffic and citizens. The game is beautiful like a painting; I can spend a lot of time just admiring what I've created. Balance problems are present though; like my bus stops seem to be overpopulated with masses of passengers waiting for their buses.\n\nI recommend using mods as there are already an ocean of them. I've downloaded new buildings as well as fun camera tweaks that make it possible to actually walk around the streets like an ordinary citizen (The First Person Mod). Superbly immersive and gives you some awesome screenshots! I can't wait to see what the future brings with DLC's and mods.

Especially traffic management. Although the game is meant to be a successor to Simcity 4 and an epic "take that" at Simcity 5, it's more of an expansion pack for Cities in Motion 2 since you'll be spending most of your time building costly road layouts and alleviating impossibly-complex traffic grimlocks originating from said road layouts. Thankfully this time you have a proper user-friendly GUI and grid/non-grid transition system to assist you when placing and aligning splines according to your OCD level. Be sure to always focus on transit-oriented development rather than classic suburban sprawl as this game is almost completely Northwest Euro-centric in nature.\n\nCompared to SC4 though, many vital elements are either oversimplified or nonexistent; whilst new concepts such as sewage disposal are shoved up your ♥♥♥ without regard to any learning curve, and normally mundane tasks become so overpowered such that it's an instant game-over if your rubbish trucks are too slow. (No, seriously.) Starting a new town, however, is considerably less tedious as there are in-built milestones to restrict asset requirements to your population growth level. But ultimately, this game is set in the present day, when your cims expect everything from power to water and even Internet services from the moment you zone your first residential area and have nearly zero tolerance or grace period for any unfortunate events; so treat all your peepur like stereotypical teenage white girls at all times or it's express bankruptcy for you. Whether take this as a challenge or setback, your mileage may vary. Interesting new features like fluid mechanics and restricted aviation pathways also help to determine your final city layout, reducing the monotony of the mid-game era.\n\nPersonally, I feel that Colossal Order have definitely learnt from most of their mistakes committed in CIM2; whether or not Paradox published games' infamous DLC-spam policy also applies to this release is yet to be confirmed. Many of the other "overwhelmingly positive" reviews seem to be rants from starved city-building fanboys and SC5 haters who long-awaited a player-friendly magnum opus of the genre, praising CSL for the messianic role it plays in the wake of SC5's epic failure with little thought about the potential shortcomings of this hastily-released masterpiece. Even though flaws in the Unity Engine's ability to cope with the game design remain evident, it's clear why this game broke 1,000,000 purchases in about the time it took for Gangnam Style views to hit 100 times that number. And yes, you can mod that in-game too, for free.","July 19, 2015","true","116.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It's sold at a reasonable price, it has huge scope, & the modding community is awesome adding an enormous amount of content for free.\nI do have a few gripes however...\nTraffic becomes a real pain as your city grows. It becomes a major frustration trying to solve your cities traffic woes. Adding other means of travel has little effect as roads to & from your airports, harbours, & train stations often just moves the issue from 1 place to another. Trains themselves become a real headache as there's only 2 entrance & exit tracks on the map. The problem is that your cargo & commuter trains share the same track. You can split them once they enter your city, but they enter & leave your city on the same track. This causes them to back up which has a knock-on effect on the cargo & people aboard. Things are fine at low density, but as soon as you add high-rise high desity the traffic just really starts to go pair shaped.\nAnother issue I found was the death rate. I don't know whether ibola is hitting my city, but whole blocks die off in a matter of in-game seconds. I live in a town, & in the 12 years I've lived there only 1 person has ever died. I keep pollution right down & clincs & hospitals abundant. It must be a balancing issue.\n\nAll in all it can be a fun game, but as the city grows the game begins to irritate me. Now I just play it every so often & usually start from scratch. I would recommend at a discounted price...","June 3","true","138.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"

Need to replace it until it works)\n- The game pace is too fast. I could get new land at although my city is still small.\n- The price for buying new land is too cheap. How can new land is cheaper than my drain pipe.\n- Some traffic's flow is annoying. The decision for choosing side of road by driver is just for the direction for next intersection.\n- Stll lack of variety of model. Especially, when building is high level.\n\nSo far it is great city builder game in market. You could design your own city freely. Tools of making road is userfriendly and the UI is so minimalize so you could get all information fast.

I only spend playing  40 hours and already built everything in the city reached the final stage and have no problems with my city. only build cemeteries all over the place.\nonly real issue with simcity5 is their launch disaster .\n\n[so the final verdict is that simCity5 is far more superior version than cities skylines]\n\n\n2- cities XL\nat first i thought this is another installment of that franchise . but i was wrong.  if we look at these 2 games Cities XL is way more complicated than this game. overly complected and their UI is messy  unlike cities Skyline where it runs more smoothly than that game.\nCities XL do not offer expansions of the cities but gives you Huge area to play with. u can still interact with other cities using Token system.  but beyond that nothing els.\nfrom my experience with both games I prefer Cities: Skylines over Cities XL series.","March 20, 2015","true","71.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Instead you have to connect each segment manually. It gets pretty tedious!\n\nAnd then there's the lack of a planner mode. A mode that would allow you to lay out the city in advance without any costs incurred. This would have helped with basic zoning and planning. Instead, I end up spending nearly all of my starting budget on ROADS...just to chart the damn city.\n\nIt's a bit annoying at times. Especially that fake twitter thing. A simple status update window that you could close into a tab would have been better than having a persistent blue-♥♥♥♥♥♥♥-bird hovering over your monitor the whole time.\n\nBut if I had to pick a game between Cities: Skylines and Cities XXL, I would choose Cities: Skylines, because it's an actual, honest to goodness game release, and not a copy-paste scam.","March 10, 2015","true","117.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

I only spend playing  40 hours and already built everything in the city reached the final stage and have no problems with my city. only build cemeteries all over the place.\nonly real issue with simcity5 is their launch disaster .\n\n[so the final verdict is that simCity5 is far more superior version than cities skylines]\n\n\n2- cities XL\nat first i thought this is another installment of that franchise . but i was wrong.  if we look at these 2 games Cities XL is way more complicated than this game. overly complected and their UI is messy  unlike cities Skyline where it runs more smoothly than that game.\nCities XL do not offer expansions of the cities but gives you Huge area to play with. u can still interact with other cities using Token system.  but beyond that nothing els.\nfrom my experience with both games I prefer Cities: Skylines over Cities XL series.","March 20, 2015","true","71.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

For such a complex product just after release the amount of bugs is very low, and they are actually minor bugs. Simcity 5 features better graphics, but you'll be compensated for that by a good perfomance and an overall highly addictive game.

It has expansive maps, detailed cities and population, intricate micro management, yet it's accessible and easy to pick up.\n\nGraphically the game is a looker. With detailed models, atmospheric filtering effects, and all the little things happening when you zoom in, the game look and feels alive. The audio design is immersive with the hustle and bustle of the crowds and traffic pulling the player in. Though the music seems over dramatic and on default settings it's strangely loud, but it does the job at keeping the player company.\n\nMechanically the game can get deep when you learn all the details, yet the basics to get going is pretty easy. With that said, the game still requires a degree of self research as all the finer details in it's mechanics aren't always fully explained.\n\nOverall Cities: Skylines is a very enjoyable city builder, and at it's core, every thing I wanted from a modern Sim City.\n\nPros:\n- Easy to learn\n- Lots of fine detail to micromanage\n- Great looking, very immersive\n- Supports mods\n- Huge map to build on\n\nCons:\n- Finer detail mechanics aren't always explained well\n- Some quality of life issues could use smoothing out\n\nCities: Skyline hours played at recording: 22\nCompletion Status on Cities Skyline: N/A\nThis copy of Cities: Skyline was purchased on Steam","April 1, 2015","true","55.7"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

You purchase more map tiles as you go, they are part of your live city.  No loading/saving to access another tile.  This game is downright awesome with that expansion bit - they nailed it.  I mean NAILED IT.  This is the TRUE SUCCESSOR TO SIMCITY 4 DELUXE.  THIS IS WHAT SC2013 SHOULD HAVE BEEN.  I'll write this again so everyone can see it.\n\nTHIS IS THE TRUE SUCCESSOR TO SIMCITY 4 DELUXE, THIS IS WHAT SIMCITY 2013 SHOULD HAVE BEEN.  IF YOU LOVED SIMCITY 4 AND PLAY IT TO THIS DAY, BUY THIS.  ENTIRELY WORTH IT, VERY AFFORDABLE!\n\nThere was Simcity on the SNES and pc.  Then there was Simcity 2000 on DOS 6.x on the venerable amd 486 66 ...\nThen there was Simcity 3000... but 2000 and 3000 didn't quite capture the magic that Nintendo put into the SNES version.  For so many years I kept that SNES and Simcity... and then Simcity 4 came out... it was good, but not until Rush Hour expansion was it great.  Rush Hour combined into the Original was also marketed as the Deluxe version.  Adding in the NAM mod to Simcity 4 deluxe made the game really awesome if you were into highway design, and really could excell at traffic management.  Cities XL was buggy, and laggy... and very vague (and therefor frustrating).  Cities XXL had promise but just did not deliver beyond multicore enhancements - it was generally everything (bad with the good) that XL was... re-wrapped into a new package.  Simcity 2013 had promise, but EA's greedyness and needless DRM and small city sizes/day 1 bugs really got the game off to a bad start.  You just couldn't build to your imagination's content like you could in Simcity 4 Deluxe - beyond the initial degridding.  Simcity 2013 was like a demo, a demo of something that could have been so awesome...  but last week... last week I heard some bad news.\nMaxis, to us City-Building afficianados - was something quite dear - Maxis was shuttered.  The Sims (EU studio) live on, but Simcity, as we know it, was official pulled off life support and pronounced dead... and know I know why.\n\nThis game.  GOD BLESS THESE DEVS, SKYLINES NAILS IT.  EVERYTHING.  5/5!!!\n\nThere is SO much realism packed into this game, and many things I did not expect.\nTraffic management? Check!\nAbility to build with realism using roads/avenues/bypasses to hearts content? Check!\nHighways, offramps/onramps buildable?  Check!\nMultilevel bridge over bridge stuffs for super-snazzy interchanges?  Check! (Roundabout, cloverloaf, diamond, trumpet, freeform entirely -not just PREFABS only, if you like - your imagination and the space available is your only limit)\nLarge expansion of the city as needed?  Check! (more with MOD support)\n64bit exe and NO memory leaks?  Check!\nGREAT graphics (for a city builder)?  Check!  [Directx 11 video card required under Windows!]\nSufficient sound feedback and decent music?  Check!  (Music in non-intrusive, sound fx I have no complaints on)\nGood play control/movement/UI design?  Check!\nMod support?  Well, not yet - but devs are promising it!\nHealthcare AND deathcare? EEK!  Check!\nTrains for passengers AND freight?  Check!\nSeaports for passengers AND freight?  Check!  (improves industrial demand)\nAirports to attract more tourists and connect you better to the outside world (and their money!!!)? Check!\nAbility to creat custom maps and a terrain editor (and importing greyscale heightmaps)? Check!\nAbility to build in sunny tropical climate, or the more northern latitudes (custom gfx, sun angle)? Check!\nBroad range of options to customize the game to your hardwares ability/disability?  Check!\nAlternative ways to solve the many problems you face, and the ability to see you have them? Check & double Check!!!\nGame breaking bugs?  Nope - not in over 9 hours into it... not anything I can see. No CTDs, no glitchyness, nothing.\nI could go on and on...  58,000+ people in the city, 6 million in the treasury and making a good income monthly.\nI just can't seem to want to stop playing or get bored of this... I am absolutely in shock at how good this game is.\n\nSimcity 4 Diehards, This is the game WE have been waiting for - do NOT hesitate!  NO REGRETS HERE!\nTHIS GAME IS NOT AND IS NOT AFFILIATED WITH CITIES XL OR CITIES XXL IN ANY WAY/SHAPE/FORM, OTHER THAN IT BEING A CITY BUILDER, A GOOD ONE AT THAT, A REALLY REALLY GOOD ONE.\n\n\nThere are only TWO reasons you should not buy this game.\n1.) If you cannot afford it.  The price IS very reasonable - VERY REASONABLE.\n2.) If you have a video card that is not capable of DirectX 11.  Do not use Intel video, it's glitchy.\nThat said, those on Intel-based laptops, you need to force this game to use the dedicated AMD or NVIDIA gpu, otherwise it will be slow and glitchy defaulting to the laptop's Intel gfx.  You can do this from inside AMD Catylist, or Nvidia Control Panel.  You can find these solutions in the discussion forums here on Steam.  INTEL GFX IS NOT SUPPORTED.\n\n\nAs stated above, hardware specs are here:\ni7 4790k @ 4.6ghz on Asus Maximus Hero VII Z97 Chipset motherboard\n16gb 2400mhz ram (8gb x2) corsair dominator\nAsus Radeon 7850 2gb gddr5 [1ghz core] video card with Direct CU II cooling (the don't-ever-hear-it cooler)\nDual Toshiba SSD drives in Raid 0 for OS & Games, for quick loading (almost zero load times. maybe a second or two)\nSoundblaster X-fi Titanium pro soundcard\nFractal Arc XL case with Seasonic 750 watt PSU, and Phanteks somethin'-14 red cooler\n\nI listed everything in the event someone wants to dupe the whole hardware config, game runs AWESOME.  NO LAG on HIGH settings.\n\nSeriously, get this game now.  You'll be glad you did.   The devs really got this one right.  Finally, A SIMCITY 4 REPLACEMENT!\n\nIf you're a small kid with no money, do some extra chores for money!  Paint the dog, wash the lawn, mow the hedges, trim the carpet, vacuum the dishes, sweep the walls, scrub the garden, tiedye your white kittycat, ANYTHING to make money to buy this game (actually forget the bit with the cat, that might get you grounded, or worse, clawed and grounded).\n\nCan't wait to see what the NAM team does with this one :)\n\n--Cheers guys and good luck!  ... now if I can just kill that annoying little blue bird...\n\n***Laptop users DON'T forget if you have intel GFX to make sure this game uses the AMD or NVIDIA GPU!  Desktop users should be just dandy as this issue won't happen.  AGAIN, INTEL GFX IS NOT SUPPORTED AT THIS TIME/POSSIBLY EVER.","March 10, 2015","true","323.6"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","5","7","0","1"

All of the zones you zone and all of the buildings you build are there to drive traffic in & out of your city. 90% of your planning and building and organizing goes towards the road network, to the point of micromanaging and obsessing. 90% of the problems you will face when laying out your city will be road related.\n\nBuilding the city just involves dragging zones with a paint tool and plonking down service buildings like hospitals and schools. All the cities end up looking and feeling very, very similar. The cities are very easy to build and grow. The only real challenge you ever face is designing a road network that flows and is not chaotic. This is fine. This can be fun. This can be interesting, and challenging.

Graphics look great (once I figured out how to reduce the angle blur).\n\nForcing myself to take a break for lunch.  Most difficult thing I've done all week.\n----------\nJust cleared 16,000 population.  Don't know how long I've been playing.\n\nStill no problems.  Except the dead people.  There just aren't enough hearses and I can't build another cemetary yet.  Because of the trash problem.  The downtown fill is full, and it has to be emptied before the roads can be upgraded.  I've got four incinerators running to get rid of all that old trash.  Not sure why we can't just do the same with the dead people...\n\nForcing myself to take a break for dinner.  Very very difficult to stop playing now.\n----------\nSteam says I've played for 12 hours now.  I don't remember what my town population is.\n\nBut it doesn't matter.  People are irrelevant.  Only highways and train lines matter.  Beautiful, flowing lines of traffic with graceful easements and interchanges.\n\nI did find one problem.  Clicking on a public transport vehicle (bus, train, etc) allows you to edit that line.  Subway cars cannot be clicked.  They can be seen in the public transportation overlay, but vehicles are not clickable on that screen.  It's impossible to edit the color of a subway line.  It's very difficult to delete it.\n\nAlso, I named a dog.  It tried to go to high school.  Someone chased it away.  Then the building caught fire.

Obviously that does not say much when you compare what has come out since SC4 but still it is a great game.

No option to buy land past that (at least that I have found).  That said 8 extensions is a lot but would be nice to build more.  Right now I have a city at 110K population though it has been there for a while.

The free weekend came along and I thought "why not?"... look at my hours now.\n\n✓ 100% moddable\nSpecific buildings of all types, colors and flavors, intersections, maps, different lighting settings, gameplay-altering mods... just about anything can be found in the workshop. Be warned though: using mods disables achievements.\n\n✓ Fair learning curve\nYou might think a game like this is too complicated, but the truth is... it's not. Cities: Skylines is as complicated as you make it. Sure, if you're a beginner (like me), your first cities will fail, but that's exactly what makes this game so replayable: you learn by failing, and it's fun as hell.\n\n✓ Endless possibilities and replayability\nRural town? Metropolis? European capital? Futuristic city? A replica of your town? The only limit is your imagination[gfycat.com]\n\n\n✗ No season pass\nAs of now, they've released two expansions: After Dark and Snowfall. They'll release more, and that's good, but there's no way to buy a game+expansions pack, which means that no one knows the pricetag for the ultimate experience, and you might end up spending hundreds of euros in the game if they keep releasing expansions. You might think "how is that a problem? If they release more content, I'll happily pay". Well, look at Train Simulator. Would you pay 4,000€ for the full experience? I'm not saying Paradox will take the same route, but they could, and you should be wary.\n\nVerdictCities: Skylines has quickly turned into one of my favorite games.

After that, it is chugging out more zones for the city to grow.\nPeople complaining about not enough healthcare? Dump another hospital somewhere in the vicinity and the issue is solved. Once your city is going money is no longer an issue.\nThis cycle repeats until you are too bored to continue.\n\nThe only interesting and difficult part is managing your traffic, which is somewhat annoying since you need to reach a certain population milestone before you can start building highways and such, making it hard to plan your infrastructure in advance.\n\nThere's also this amazing feature of the game (or maybe Unity) eating up as much RAM it can get its hands on.

The basic core is you have to manage the demands of your city while building new infrustructure. Sounds fun, except it really comes down to 3 demands: Housing, Industry, and Commercial. If the demand for housing goes up? Build a road and zone it for houses. How about Industry and Commercial? Do the same thing.\n\nSure, there are other things like resource management where you actually have to have the power, water/sewage, and other civil services. But a few hours in to my game I guess I found a sweet spot between growth and taxes because my cash flow exploded in to the millions before I even realized it happened. I could put hospitals and police on every street corner.\n\nMy city had become somewhat of a paradise, and it felt too easy.","September 5, 2015","false","13.4"," 83 of 160 people (52%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","52","83","160","8","6"

Unlike many other games, Cities skyline does not confuse you with similar icons or different varieties of colour all over the screen.\n\n2) Game provides enough information for the user to keep everything under control and does not get lost.\n\n3)Attractive design, good graphics and fun in-game Activities. Maybe by now, you think the game is a serious strategy game; which in fact it is to some degrees, but it does not lose its entertainment part. This game gives you so many small in-game activities and does not limit you to only designing your city. you can click on a random citizen or a car, get full information of them such as who owns the car, what is the type of car or where your citizen lives, works does or what is he doing. You can rename them to whatever you want and it does not get limited to cars and citizens, you can rename buildings, factories, shops, animals, parks and even streets. \\n\n4) I hardly can remember any bug or problem in game that bothered me ... good updates fixed everything\n\n*************************************************************************\nThis game is everything that you need to build your dream cities.\n\none of the most important parts of this game is its community. the game has a tool that allows you to create or edit an existing building (that includes parks, houses and such) or even a map. You can come up with crazy ideas and make them happen. Even better you have chance to share it with others via steam workshop and let others enjoy too. Infact I made alot of buildings that people use them right now.\n\nYou can also get what others made and have fun with unique looking buildings\n************************************************************************************\n\n•	Your creativity and imagination are the only things that matter.  The game does not limit you with rules; in fact you are free to try different designs. With different tools you have option to create your city just as you like\n\n*************************************************************************************\nThis game is a complete example of a good interface / well-designed game. It pretty much fulfils all expectations and meets all the principles of a good interface. It is impossible to think of a bad aspect in the game as everyone is satisfied by this game. Even if you have no experience with games; you can start Cities skyline with no fear of getting lost in the game and you can enjoy having a good time playing this game\n\n\nHighly recommended","April 6, 2015","true","18.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Feels a lot like SimCity 4, but with better graphics and better traffic simulation. It is by the people who made the City in Motion games, so not surprising. It leaves SimCity 2013 in the trash bin where it belongs.\n\nIt has social policies you can zone to particular areas of the map. A nice touch. It has a MASSIVE playing area. You will NOT run out of space. Pretty much not ever, even if you try. My  current game has train lines going between isolated town areas, and a big city area. It feels more like a small country than a single city.\n\nThe negatives I have to mention are that there doesn't appear to be an "undo" button once you do something, and there appears to be no way to reverse one way streets. You have to destroy them and rebuild them. Kinda silly.  Those are just small nitpicks though.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zoomba/recommended/255710/","zoomba","Zoomba","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zoomba/","603 products in account","SimCity was one of the very first games I was ever really hooked on.  I vividly remember building cities in black-and-white on my dad's office Macintosh.  Since then I've jumped on pretty much any game that claims to be city-builder-ish.\n\nAnd not since SimCity 4, over a decade ago, have I had this much fun building a city from scratch.\n\nThe scale of the space you can build in is great.  Starting with 2km x 2km and eventually expanding out to 9km^2, you can build truly massive cities. What makes that scale even better is you can really divide up your metropolis in a number of ways.  From districts that can have individualized govt policies (legal pot, smoke detector ditribution), to localized city services that aren't connected to the larger grid.  The game gives you a ton of room to experiment.\n\nThe one big challenge though you'll face is transportation.  Building an effecient city grid of roads, public transit, trains & subways that doesn't have terrible choke points is difficult.  Use of elevated bypasses, rail corridors etc are difficult to plan as you don't get access to them until an hour or more into a game, so you may find yourself abandoning your initial city area to build up things "properly" in a newly opened plot of land, then going back and bulldozing your original downtown to start it over again.\n\nBeyond the traffic challenge, it can at times be difficult to know why your city isn't growing.  Sometimes demand drops to 0 for no apparant reason, then 5 minutes later skyrockets again.  There's obviously something going on that's pushing down demand, but as a player it's hard to figure out some times.  A few patches to improve UI and reporting will no doubt solve this issue.\n\nIn the end, the traffic planning and the simulation feedback issues are pretty minor in the face of what's probably the most fun city sim since the glory days of Maxis.  And at what I'd consider a "budget" price point, if you're a fan of the genre, this is a must-buy game.","March 11, 2015","true","37.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The mods however should over time offer a massive amount of content and I feel like it's only a matter of that this comment becomes irrelevant.\n- Small gripe, but why can't the different lines be different colours? I find it really confusing and quite finicky to create a bus line.\n- Another small gripe, but the two different blues used for Offices and Light Commercial are too similar, I often click the wrong one.\n- Not very...exciting? It's fun to play, its light hearted, its nice to kill a bit of time but after an hour or two I found myself logging out. Some sort of immersion is missing. There isn't that much do apart from expand your city, there's no trade (not that I have yet seen) for example. Maybe having some "ghost AI" cities far on the horizon that you can't visit but see could be connecting to your city and then opening possibilities of trade would be really awesome and give more emphasis on feeling that you're part of a connected world.

City sizes are 9x bigger, and easily modded to 25x bigger than SC2k13.

Modding support is also a huge feature that is offered. The Steam Workshop has over 1000 mods, models and maps already online less than 24 hours after the release. There are a handful of requests for features that didn't make it to release, but the devs promised that they would continue working on this game to include as many new features as possible. (Such as road & highway tunnels, disasters and day/night cycles).\n\nThis is only the first day of the launch, and the game is already extremely stable, and looks beautiful.\nI look forward to seeing what the devs and the mod community comes up with in the future!\n\nThis game was created by a small indie development team and look at what they produced. I highly recommend this game to anyone who felt disappointed with SimCity and wants to play a genuine city simulator that has the fun of previous versions, but the new features that modern gamers want to play.","March 11, 2015","true","125.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

A fantastic game that deserves the spotlight right now. Only time will tell with modding and add ons wherre this game will go.

Feels a lot like SimCity 4, but with better graphics and better traffic simulation. It is by the people who made the City in Motion games, so not surprising. It leaves SimCity 2013 in the trash bin where it belongs.\n\nIt has social policies you can zone to particular areas of the map. A nice touch. It has a MASSIVE playing area. You will NOT run out of space. Pretty much not ever, even if you try. My  current game has train lines going between isolated town areas, and a big city area. It feels more like a small country than a single city.\n\nThe negatives I have to mention are that there doesn't appear to be an "undo" button once you do something, and there appears to be no way to reverse one way streets. You have to destroy them and rebuild them. Kinda silly.  Those are just small nitpicks though.

It also does alot to bring new wrinkles into the established formula. Being able to name and customize pretty much anything in the game is fantastic. And also having the ability to create separate districts within the city is a great addition. You can even set different policies within each district. Want an area with no smoking? You can do that. Want people to recycle? Click the checkbox.\n\nOnly thing I'd say that could be considered 'negative' would be that you can't take any loans out until you reach a population of 400+. So if you get a little overzealous when starting out (like I did), you might find yourself in a bind. You can take a Bailout, but then that disables being able to do certain things.\n\nOverall I'm really enjoying the game, and I can see this being a top played for me for awhile.","March 15, 2015","true","37.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Feel like I can give an early impressions review.\n\nPros:\n\n- Performance is very good, smooth, the camera never stutters. Have felt no slow-ups.\n- Easy to pick up the nuances of the game.\n- Pretty.\n- Mods. And this will save the game (see cons)\n\nCons:\n- I feel like there isn't much variety in types of buildings. The mods however should over time offer a massive amount of content and I feel like it's only a matter of that this comment becomes irrelevant.\n- Small gripe, but why can't the different lines be different colours? I find it really confusing and quite finicky to create a bus line.\n- Another small gripe, but the two different blues used for Offices and Light Commercial are too similar, I often click the wrong one.\n- Not very...exciting? It's fun to play, its light hearted, its nice to kill a bit of time but after an hour or two I found myself logging out. Some sort of immersion is missing. There isn't that much do apart from expand your city, there's no trade (not that I have yet seen) for example. Maybe having some "ghost AI" cities far on the horizon that you can't visit but see could be connecting to your city and then opening possibilities of trade would be really awesome and give more emphasis on feeling that you're part of a connected world. At the moment it just feels very isolated.\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nOverall, it's worth the money and fun to play even it's a bit shallower than I had hoped.","March 11, 2015","true","87.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Then I built a few highways from Downtown to decrease traffic on the main bridge.. and wow.. it worked.. everything I think I wanna do in this game, it does it. Re-name suburbs, making it enviromental now. Unlimited money mod day 1, something I credit the makers of this game for (unlike simcity 5 that have been absolute asses with cheats/mods). The Traffic / people are so realisitc in movement.. Its what Simcity should of done!?!\nIf you like builder games, this is for you! Its worth $90.. seriously..

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/hoekn/recommended/255710/","hoekn","Hoken","http://steamcommunity.com/id/hoekn/","110 products in account","Cities: Skylines by Paradox Interactive is an iterative game. It grabs the majority of things it has on display from city building games in the past and makes up what is effectively a big playground for you to play around in. Nothing is spared from Cities XL, Cities in Motion (a previous Paradox title) and the Sim City franchise. The reason for its hype and stature is not that it has all these things in it. All of these functions and mechanics have been on display before.\n\nIt is well received by city building fanatics and casual players because it does these things *well*. Sim City 4 has many quirks, and despite the nostalgia surrounding it, that game has some extremely dated mechanics that detract from the experience. Sim City 2013 came around and people wanted a way to enjoy the good old stuff from Sim City 4 in a better, more enjoyable, more modern fashion. Needless to say it didn't live up to its promises, everyone twelve feet from the nearest rock should be filled in on that by now. Cities XL is a buggy mess that breaks apart merely a few hours in playing it. 'Skylines' yanks the best mechanics from these games and others and pull them off the way they should have been pulled off. No essential content is locked away behind a paywall. The cities are as large as they should be -and should you want even larger cities, the surprisingly smooth modding element of this game makes it easy to expand the default 6 tile plot size to 25 provided your PC can handle it- with no holds barred.\n\nYour traditional pieces of city building goodness are present here, for all to enjoy. The roads are satisfying to build and maintain, the statistics and logistics make sense unlike in Sim City to the game's best intentions, and the already mentioned mod support is a godsend. Tired of the tweeting bird that never wants to shut up? There's a mod to remove that. Unhappy with the fact that a structure isn't in the game? Download it from the steam workshop without even restarting the game.\n\nIt's not a very forgiving game, which you may discover if you're migrating from Sim City 2013. The difficulty mainly hangs on to the fact that this game makes sense. It's not always 100% dead on in terms of the bigger decimals and values it pushes, but compared to some of the more nonsensical things present in Sim City it's surprisingly accurate. The game definitely punishes you for doing a sloppy job as city manager. Prepare to have many headaches if you don't pay attention to where you put your water pipes, or if you don't have a backup power source when your power plant burns down because you didn't put a fire station anywhere close. That's on you, buddy.\n\nNo game is perfect, mind, and the game has legitimate pieces of content that isn't there as of writing this review, a proper way to terraform while in the city and make your own bodies of water being a glaring omission. Some parts of the game also don't make much sense without a proper tutorial, like the commute system which I can't figure out at all. I also don't think you should have to search Google to see if too many water pipes is going to be an issue, or how the water purification system functions. Considering how much Paradox cares about their customers tjough, these issues are insignificant to most when seeing just how well it all performs. My graphics card is six years old, and my processor isn't anything special, and I'm still surprised that six tile cities manage to run this good without a hitch on my system.\n\nAnything less than stellar can either be patched by Paradox or simply modded in. As a base game it beats most, and at a £30 launch price it leaves a good taste in my mouth, and it should in yours too. With developer love and a high ability to mod it, this game is sure to be the de facto city builder for many years to come. The future is bright.","March 12, 2015","true","426.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Fixing it is very frustrating, or even impossible, due to bugs, and requires tearing it down and retrying- spending budget and time. Bad results and frustration are the reward for understanding this game's "logic".  There are however, other (non road) solutions for traffic problems\n\nAlthough the game is fun at first, quickly, you realize you _NEED_ one way roads (because there is a bug where cars _always_ stop even if by every rule and logic THEY DO have priority.) and thus overpasses to get these connected. Having just come from a session of FAILING to construct workable overpasses about 20 times in a row, I am done with this game.\n\nEvery time I get a road constructed the way I like it, it tends to be constructed wrong direction. This means I have to change the direction, but- with my overpasses- I  get a mesage I have no room. So I tear it down, try again, repeat X20.\nWhen it finally works, it looks like a piece of crap.\n\n\nSince there is no 'mixed' review I have no idea to vote it up or down.

The traffic mechanic is really well optimised although the flaw that i have found in the algorithm is that the cars are programmed to take the WIDEST road and not the most direct road, eg. If i have an industrial estate with 3 entrances, one a 2 lane 2 way road and the other is a 6 lane 2 way road, all the cars (or at least 90% of them) will take the 6 lane road as the cars think that taking the wider road is the better option as you can fit more cars onto them but when all the cars think that then they soon build up and you have to rethink all your roads... But thats what i enjoy, finding problems in my roads and then spending the time to fic, fix and fix again to make to they work as best the can! Also i have found that more entrances and exits DO NOT make the traffic smoother as more roads mean more junctions with more traffic lights, slow the cars down so 1 entrance is more effective than 17.

I would say that many of the comparisons to the latest Sim City aren't all that helpful because they seem to view this game as far superior to that game when there are lots of tradeoffs that both games have made.\n\nData visualization in this game is somewhat poor in comparison to Sim City 2013. Cities: Skylines also doesn't have different wealth classes, a highly ambiguous Land Value system along with a slightly difficult to follow specialization system, and the user interface is... borderline Cities XL bad. It's also not entirely bug free with massive traffic clogging occurring at entrances to the city (much like issues that plagued Sim City 2013). Traffic agents in this game aren't all that smart and there are tons of quirks that make it frustrating to play at times: buildings becoming abandoned because a dead person wasn't picked up, really? It would help if all of the hearses didn't crowd around one building--like the fire engines crowd around a single burning building (again, an issue that occurred in Sim City 2013). The notification system is also completely useless and just serves as an obnoxious distraction from gameplay.\n\nThe bad aside, I like this game. I'm not forced to stop playing after a few hours because of some bug or because my city is already bursting out of its boundaries. The system of buying more land plots to expand your city is ingenious and somehting that I'm surprised no one thought of before. I love the public transit system and all the little nuanced features it has though it can be a little daunting to set up at first. There are lots of little features that really help make this game s city builder worth playing.\n\nOverall, I feel like this game is almost like a Microsoft product: trying to be all things while never succeeding at doing a single thing perfectly well. It could use more polish (they're already releasing patches), but is definitely a recommended title for any avid city builder.  I've found that most reviewers are just happy that they have a city builder that isn't Sim City 2013, but I'd say that there are many things that that game did very well that Cities: Skylines doesn't and vice versa. If I were to rate Cities: Skylines, I would give it a 7.5/10 -- Good, but not great with its share of flaws.","March 29, 2015","true","6.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

If you've played the classics then you'll be right at home and if you're new to the genre, this is a great starting point. There's a couple of teeny tiny issues that are mostly opinion-based but nothing that breaks the game. 9.5/10\n\nFirst and foremost, it's not without its flaws - but the flaws are quickly lost in the charm and incredible achievement that the developers attained with this game.\n\nThe immediate sense of creative freedom you get with Skylines is apparent the moment you start on your first lot. Yes, the appearance of the dreaded 'city boundaries' might remind some of the restrictions of other city building games, but once you start laying road and placing zones, you realize the scale fits perfectly, usually having you spend a good few hours in your first square alone. Then you discover you can buy more plots.\n\nThe gameplay is very reminiscent of other city builders - no point trying to fix what isn't broken. Although I'd say that Skylines easily fixes some attempted mechanics that other city builders attempted in the past. The agent system - where you can follow every individual person and vehicle (even animal, if you want) - might still not be perfect, things still very 'processed' whereas in real life things a little more chaotic, it still works well enough. A common complaint is traffic, but that's not the agents' fault, but more likely the fault of the road layout.\n\nSpeaking of which, this is probably the biggest challenge of the game. Managing traffic will likely take more of your time than zoning and controlling land value. Thankfully the game offers you a massive set of tools to best manage your roads, the only limit is your imagination~. The game will also intelligently place roads as best it can, meaning you'll usually always be able to make a junction even if the angle is a little tight.\n\nOne of the few little caveats that I certainly run in to is pipe placement. Power lines and pipes need to be placed manually - the former never too much an issue since buildings link power between themselves in a small radius, connecting to each other so long as they're close enough. Water and sewage pipes, however, need to be placed manually every time you expand your city. Maybe I'm just lazy, but it's always easy to forget when power takes care of itself.\n\nPerhaps the modding community may have a solution - as this game is highly moddable. The in-game asset creator allows people to import models and customize buildings to help diversify the rather small set of preset buildings - as well as powerful scripting mods to add entirely new features (of writing, one of the most popular mods is the auto-bulldoze mod).\n\nAll in all, if you've been looking for a city builder to sink your time in to and thoroughly enjoy, Cities: Skylines won't do you wrong. The price point is fantastic for a game this entertaining and as much as people might draw comparisons to other city builders, I personally think Skylines can very well stand on its own in the genre.","March 29, 2015","true","19.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Getting straight to the point, Cities Skylines takes the new SimCity back to basics, and nails those basics spot on. This includes huge maps, a terrain editor, lots of transportation options and competant graphics. In doing this, it has also taken steps back.\n\nThis game comes with the same flaws that the older games had: you would lay some roads, zone an area, and place one of each service in the centre of that area. You would repeat this over and over again. Whereas in SC 2013, they added modular buildings and specialisations to mix up the gameplay (such as adding casinos with different room types for wealth levels), this new game is purely zoning and placing the same buildings over and over. Even the specialisations are actually reskins of the industrial zones, and are zoned with the same tools. They offer little difference to the gameplay.\n\nIf you want huge maps, and are simply interested in designing a city for the sakes of it, then I can recommend to you this game very easily! It has plenty of tools to make your perfect city "look" like a perfect city. But, if you want a simulation that does not rely on your imagination, has more content and is less repetitive, then SimCity is your best bet. For example, in Cities: Skylines you can pretend to have a tourist area, whereas in SimCity you actually see tourists being simulated and affecting your economy based on the wealth levels of the attractions you have built (Cities: Skylines has no wealth levels either).","March 30, 2015","true","105.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

So the focus is transport and you can build the city as you want because the game is almost to easy. Is easy to get money but your city will suffer from a chain of problems that you can address by adding resurces, reshaping roads and smoothing trafic. Anyway no metter how many problem the city does have is almost inpossible that your citizen become unahppy; and because criminality is linked to happyness police is not really necessaty. I suggest to give a try to the vanilla game before installing any mod/map\n\nMods\nThe mod can already totally reshape the game experience: you can download tons of additional buildings both ploppable or growable, you can change the point of view to street level, alter the colur scheme and resolution, alter the interface (tranforming Chirpy in a scroll text just like the one on SC4), alter games rules to increase or decrease the challenge.\nMaps are also great: usign the site terrain.party you can download a map from your favourite location in the world, and since the map in the game is preaty big you can recreate a small city and its sourrounding. The water simulation express its true potential when you try to add a river in your custom map.\n\nTL:DR\nA great Game, maybe non perfect and not particularry challenging, but surely a great platform with a lot of potential for modding or expansion","April 2, 2015","true","60.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It's a big middle finger to EA's SimCity.

Welp, Here I am, the guy that might actually make you get the game, so here is what I think.\n\nFirstly, the game runs INCREDIBLY smoothly, I have made a moderately large city in the short time I have played it, and it maintains a solid FPS no matter what view or task I am performing.\n\nThe graphics are incredible, you can zoom right in and see little timmy running to school or his mom getting plowed by the mailman while dad is at work in the ice factory\n\nTraffic is no longer a stagnant image, nor is it a randomly spawned graphic to make the game 'pretty', the cars and trucks and trains and planes and buses are there for a reason, and the people in them are there for a reason, if you follow Mr.X from his house, you will actually see him get on the bus, go to work at his job, come back and go home to the same house. Same applies to delivery trucks etc. Pretty awesome.\n\nThe game has a pretty nice pace, you have only a select few abilities in the beginning, and as you progress you unlock more things such as hospitals, schools etc, so the learning curve is perfect, you get the hang in no time.\n\nNow, you might get in the game, select an environment to start Jakeisadipshitville and go "WHAT!? The size of my area to build is TINY!", Relax, you can actually purchase adjacent tiles of land repeatedly to expand your trailer park of a town, and it costs surprisingly low amounts.\n\nAll in all, the game looks nice, runs nice, plays nice and it gets a solid 9.5/10 from me, there are tiny issues such as, no tunnels, no terraforming etc. That I simply prefer and of course the game is not catered for me personally anyway.\n\nBuy it, it is worth it!","March 11, 2015","true","40.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

While some may not like Paradox's DLC model (and let's be honest, it can be a bit intimidating for new players), CSL offers loads of awesome content out of the box for a very affordable price. Micro-managers will love the ability to fine tune almost every aspect of their cities, from the names of city districts all the way down to following a single citizen around throughout his day. While there is a bit of a learning curve and the in-game tutorial is rather lacking (a hallmark of Paradox games) there are many youtubers and an official wiki that can help get you up to speed.

Unlike EA's most recent installment, however, Skyline understands what its consumers want. None of that token multiplayer online-connection ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t; it's just a quality city simulator with excellent modding support and a quality developer.\n\nI'll get the negatives out of the way first. One of the most annoying things is a Twitter knockoff that pops up on the top of your screen. Yes, it keeps you informed on what the citizens are thinking but not nearly as intuitively as one would like. Plus, it's annoying. Outside of that, there are a few other things here and there; buildings get abandoned like no one's business, and I would much rather have some sort of construction crew I could hire rather than having to go through and manually bulldoze each individual abandoned property. The public transit systems, while useful, don't provide the best feedback on how popular they are or how efficiently they are functioning. Finally, the roads could use a bit less liberal snapping; it's very hard to keep things straight, and you end up wasting space.\n\nThat might seem like a lengthy negative paragraph at a glance, but I'll be honest: it's just nitpicks here and there. The game is quality with incredible simulation: all your citizens can be tracked, and their cars can be clicked and observed extensively. And when they ask why the mayor is sitting in the back of their car? Who cares. You are the one true mayor. How dare they question the authority of your elected office?\n\nThere are a lot of nice touches to the game that make the cities you build feel vibrant and realistic. Water flow is key to maintaining a balance between pollution and your water supply, and the physics, while simple, are effective. The game isn't some casual time-waster either; forethought and budgeting are required to stay afloat. But if you don't want to worry about that, there's also auto-installed mods for things like unlimited money and full-unlocks. You can buy land for your city with each milestone you achieve through population growth, as well as gain upgrades to your buildings and districts. The game also runs very well, and the mechanics are very easily picked up--especially if you have experience with your classic city-management builder. If you don't like any of the maps, there is also a map creator you can use, which is fun to use if I do say so myself.\n\nSo all in all? This is a quality addition to the genre. It's accessible to newer players and refreshing to veterans, and if you are a fan of the genre, I would highly recommend it. The game is full of content, and new content is being added by the vibrant modding community. The developers treat the community with respect and appreciation (UNLIKE A CERTAIN OTHER COMPANY), and they are very actively involved, appreciating feedback and discussion among their forums. So yeah, there are a few faults here and there, but I would say this game is definitely worth it's price.","June 14, 2015","true","9.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
