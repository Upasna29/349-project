"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nutriiimilk/recommended/355240/","nutriiimilk","Nutritious","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nutriiimilk/","282 products in account","Several things to take note of:\nThe game language is initially set to Japanese. This can be set to English in the options menu.\nThe devs went out of their way to set initial language to English in an update! How nice.\n\nThis game is certainly an anamoly. It's a 3D bullet hell versus game with, uh, crustaceans as the combatants. I'm jumping on reviewing this because I was really pleasantly surprised.\n\nThe devs have it down to a point in the description; these are creatures we eat so casually, yet underwater, they are some of the most inclined to fight with one another over mates within their own species, even for food amongst other crustacean species. I mean, look up a crab and lobster fighting. It's some interesting stuff.\n\nAnd I believe that is perfectly captured in this game. Just with the addition of lasers and bullets being shot out of their eyes and energy claw attacks and what not. I can see that there was love put into this thing; the Snow Crab, for instance, can only move "forward" by turning sideways first.\n\nI really wouldn't dismiss this as one of those one-off funny games just because of that, though, there is some depth and rhyme and reason to it, which I will do my best to describe.\n\nA big part of the game is the fact that a majority of the crustacean fighters can sustain limb damage. Using the example of the Snow Crab once more, for instance, you can lose all of your legs and thus, experience a reduction in speed. The only way to circumvent this is to spend accumulated meter points to shed your skin and gain all your limbs back. During this maneuver, you're very vulnerable upon coming back anew. You can also self-mutilate yourself while you attack, either ranged or melee, to make your hitbox smaller or for some mad hit and run tactics.\n\nAnother feature of the game is the weakpoints of each of the fighters. Take the Hermit Crab, for instance. It cannot be damaged at all if hit in the shell they hide in. It can be broken, but you better take care of the thing before it finds another shell (think Cody's knife from Street Fighter). Thus, knowing your crustacean match-ups will lead you to AQUATIC VICTORY.\n\nEach arthopod also possesses a differing movesets, each having unique ranged and melee attacks along with charged attacks that take meter to use. Meter is accumulated by hitting and by getting hit. Careful management of meter is central in this game, I find, as you'll be a sitting duck if you lose your limbs and don't have the meter to regenerate.\n\nAfter fights you also get aquarium parts, which are not only for asthetic, but can also help you in upcoming fights. Starfish, for instance, spin around like a damn rapid spin Staryu to do some chip damage. Very nice touch, although I never really touched this feature.\n\nThe music is also gloriously manic, quite fitting for this game, honestly. You can go from some smooth jazz and traditional Japanese instrumentation as you shoot lobster lazers at barnacles to some Japanese vocal rock when you fight some of the later opponents in the "story mode". It's great.\n\nThe game is a bit lacking in giving a tutorial, but with Assassin's Creed-esque button prompts that tell you what each button does when you press it, which can be turned off at any point, it should be more than enough. The controls in of themselves can be a bit finicky at first, too, especially with the crabs in particular that can't conventionally move forwards, but it's something that I got used to, especially after taking note of things such as water current affecting your movement.\n\nI can heartily recommend this game as both a novelty and as something functional and fun. Definitely something to laugh with your friends about. There's online multiplayer too, which I haven't delved into myself. If you're not sold and the mechanics don't interest you, however, I'd say to wait for a bigger price drop, but I'm having a lot of fun with this thing myself, and it should keep you busy for a while with several difficulties, achievements and unlockable... characters.","June 8, 2015","true","2.8"," 131 of 139 people (94%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","94","131","139","13","0"

After 1-2 hours most of the essential dynamics will be evident, and gameplay becomes repetitive. After several matches, the ideal combination of (characters and items) becomes evident. Subsequently, each match will resemble the prior after you have figured out the correct mix.\n\nBackground story and subject matter are unique, interesting and humorous. I will not go in-depth into this feature as to avoid spoilers. The basic gist regards a new technology which allows humans to use sections of the oceans as aquariums. As a result, crustaceans evolve into bad-♥♥♥ laser shooting beings which, for some reason still cant figure out how to stand up right. The graphics, although not perfect, do justice to the unique story and subject matter with an appropriate tone and style.\n\nOverall, characters are well balanced, each with particular strengths and weaknesses. These traits usually balance each other out. However, in the case of the Barnacle, it's increased firepower overcompensates for its reduced mobility; which makes it an overpowered class.\n\nAiding replayability, the game contains a "Create a map" mode where you can customize your aquarium, and choosing the location for flora and fauna. The animals will aid you during battle by shielding you, shooting lasers, etc. This adds some depth to the gameplay, as you can use the (money/points/credits) you gain on each match to purchase more offensive or defensive assistance.\n\nThis is not a game with a long shelf life, but it is a fun game as you discover the different dynamics, characters, offensive and  defensive mechanisms and their optimized combinations.\n\nAs a final verdict I give it 7/10. In all truth you wont play this every day but during the time that it is played it is very fun and has about the same value as a movie. This is a sometimes food but a good sometimes food it is. Overall, this is a fun little game that will set you about the price of a movie ticket and will entertain you for at least as long. Some games are better enjoyed in small doses, this is one of those.","July 9, 2015","true","2.3"," 36 of 45 people (80%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","80","36","45","6","4"

The game comes with labels of what button does what, at least, but no explanation of mechanics behind them. It gets worse. Don't jump straight into campaign whatever you do, practise on freemode to learn the basics, because trust me:\n\nAll ♥♥♥♥ing hell breaks loose.\nPitted against my first opponent, it becomes intense VERY fast when lasers shoot out of your enemies crevices in all directions, performing nautical manuevers on a dogfighting equivalent, as I struggled to barely hobble my lobster in its general direction. And then the ♥♥♥♥ing scenery starts attacking you.\n\nYou are given literally no explanation of why anything happens in this game, you aren't told why you have the ability to fling your legs at the enemy, or what the control function actually does, or what POW even stands for, I don't even know at this point what 'Oxygen' or 'Organic matter' does in the game.\n\nSome things you that may help you first off;\n~ Holding down 'C' then pressing either Z or X detaches your melee and ranged limbs. HOWEVER, what the game doesn't explain is that they can still function and be used remotely, and have strategic uses.\n~ The scenery, as I mentioned earlier, can be your ally. The coral, leeches, sea slugs, starfish, those weird giant shrimp things, can be recruited to your team by holding 'C' in their vicinity and will proceed to attack your opponent. This can even be used to recruit your enemy's following.\n~ During the campaign, you unlock more placeable scenery, which can be added to your side of the Aquarium by pressing space and entering the Aquarium editor. This is extremely useful in the later stages of the campaign, otherwise you'll get your ♥♥♥ handed to you by that ♥♥♥♥ing CPU Lobster.\n\nOther than that, each Crustacean has their own movement and abilities you must learn in order to fight effectively, although this can be done in practise mode.\n\nAll in all, the game has alien controls that you'll be forced to become accustom to, almost no explanation of mechanics, and Crab claws that produce laser swords.\n\nIt's chaos in it's most beautiful and Crusty form. Buy the game, become the Crab King.","June 16, 2015","true","3.8"," 20 of 23 people (87%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","87","20","23","9","0"

The innovative game design is amazing and the gameplay intense. Never for the life of me did I think a crustacean based battle game could be so action packed and yet, highly rewarding on a deep emotional level!\n\nEverything from the innovative game design, to the adrenaline fuelled battles just screams "well executed". Controls are a blessing from the heavens and super intuitive. Other devs could certainly learn from this.\n\nOther than the stunning graphical detail and innovative gameplay and design, the games soundtrack is really something on its own! Rarely do you see tracks like these that well and truly immerse you into the game, whilst at the same time still managing to keep up with the almost mind-numbing action that the game provides. Eagerly awaiting soundtrack DLC!\n\nThe only downside is that the game language is, by default, set to English. Fortunately you can very easily change it to Japanese, to play it the way NEO AQUARIUM is supposed to be experienced. It's a pity that the devs decided to pander to the filthy Gaijins buying the game, but it is understandable decision in our modern globalised society.\n\nFinally, I rate this game a solid 10/10. It's almost a pity I was gifted it during a sale, as it's easily the 9 Euro worth.\n","August 17, 2015","true","6.0"," 21 of 28 people (75%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","75","21","28","13","3"

The game does not give you the controls necessary to take advantage of the cool limb system and the regrowing mechanics, and that kills the game's playability all over the place. I'm really attempting to understand why THIS control system was chosen, because it goes against simple game design elements. The game gives you a bunch of information on oxygen and what not....and you have no idea what that does. Honestly, in the end, the game works against itself: the cool concepts can't exactly overshadow the huge issues regarding the controls, and legimately makes me wonder how they were testing the game in question, because I don't see anyway that made any logical sense.\n\nVideo Gameplay and Impressions: http://youtu.be/OyVl3TkbRYU\n\nLists:\n\n+:\nI like the limb system and while I do wish that there was a bit more to it, there's some strategy here and a cool system that can be taken advantage of.\nThe weird humor. It's pretending to be badly translated, but it's hilarious none the less. Poseidon Potatos. That is all.\nIf you like crabs, this game is your friend. Do like the difference in every character on the surface. Some seem over powered.\n-:\nControls, Controls, Controls. Not only are the controls bad, but even when you get a hold of it, it does not give you the precision that you need to take advantage of those elements.\nDid I mention the controls? The controls. I can't emphasize this enough: the controls.\nThe game has a bunch of information on screen that it never explains, and honestly I can't figure out exactly what that DOES.\nRanged attacks >>>>>> melee attacks due to homing and the control system (yes I'm hammering home on this). This is particularly a problem when one character has a huge advantage when it comes to ranged.\nThe UI is pretty bad. It looks like it was an after thought.\nThe colors underwater can really hurt the game in question as it can be really hard to see what's going on.\nThe camera hates you. It's part of the controls, and it's bad, but the camera is a bad design decision all around.\nThe WTF factor doesn't overshadow the rest of the problems. I mean, WTF can be great and all, but Let's not joke about the fact that a WTF game should still be good (Octodad is a great example).","June 9, 2015","false","2.1"," 31 of 48 people (65%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","65","31","48","4","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BloodySloth/recommended/355240/","BloodySloth","BloodySloth","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BloodySloth/","435 products in account","Once you get past the bizarre setup of this game, it actually becomes... well, probably more bizarre, but there's a surprising amount of depth to this laser-crab-battle simulator.\n\nThe game essentially plays as a vs brawler where you're each a boss from a bullet hell game.  Each crustacean comes with its own array of attack patterns, and each one is wholly unique to that creature.  As a match starts up, you can try to leverage an environmental advantage by taking control of nearby wildlife which act as fodder turrets and enemies to bog down your opponent, or you can drive headlong at the other guy, batting away bullets with your melee attacks and try to drive a plasma-sheathed antennae into their heart.  You can even tear off your own limbs and have them swarm the opponent, surround you as a really weird sort of defensive array, or lie in wait as a trap.  Every creature has 3 levels of super attacks as well, which get incredibly bullet-hellish and are increasingly bizarre (one late unlock character separates into a dozen pieces which grow lightsaber arms and home menacingly toward the enemy).  It's all surprisingly compelling once you begin to open up the game, and the skill ceiling is high.  And there is that immense weirdness which is a draw all on its own.\n\nI say that there's a depth to the game, and that's true, but sadly there isn't a huge amount of breadth.  There isn't much content past a short story mode (which you'll be playing through several times to unlock characters) and an even shorter bonus story mode of only two stages that act as a sort of epilogue, and behind which are hidden the final two unlockable characters.  Speaking of characters, there are only ten, and while they encompass a huge amount of variety themselves (one can burrow, one can only shoot in the direction it's facing, one moves by reproducing and spawning copies of itself, etc etc), the low number of characters means you'll see most of what the game has to offer long before hitting that aforementioned high skill ceiling.  This means that you'll more than likely get bored and move on before mastering all the game's tricks and strategies.  Additionally, four of the characters are bosses themselves, and are intentionally cranked up to 11 and are pretty OP, meaning that only 6 of the characters are seriously playable if you were to somehow convince a friend to get in on some laser crab action (the game touts online and local vs modes).\n\nAnyway, this is a way more comprehensive and serious review than the game probably demands, but I feel like I can't talk to anyone in real life about Neo Aquarium so I'm casting my opinions of the game to the sea, so to speak. Pick this up if you were wooed by the game's strangeness, are super into spiny lobsters, or if you want to experience a wholly unique and difficult to wrangle battle game.","May 13","true","5.2"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","9","9","0","0"

Every segment on the mantis shrimps tail, every ridge on the spiny lobster, even the animations are impressively realistic. Its gameplay is fun and the class system is relatively (not perfectly by any means) balanced with some species having advantages over others or being better suited to different play styles.\n\nMy only real complaints would be that some classes need to be unlocked and the camera can be difficult to get used to. Even if I like a game I don't feel I'm enjoying it as much when I'm grinding painfully in order to unlock new classes. The camera changes on its own or manually refocuses when you hold Ctrl, but when you are near your opponent and/or the edge of the map it will automatically re-position itself which can be very confusing or tedious.\n\nOh right and the game about crustaceans (oh and anomalocaris of course) shooting lasers at each other does have some semblance of plot, or maybe it would be more appropriate to say lore? It was something about laser crabs and Wikipedia.

Only with crustaceans.\nIt progresses like your standard fighting game, pitting you against one major enemy in each stage until you work your way up to a boss. With a controller it's reasonably fun, and despite making very little sense the attacks quickly become intuitive. A variety of crustaceans makes for some extended replay value, but if you're like me you'll probably lose interest after beating the boss a couple of times.\n\nThe idea behind the game is completely insane, which makes it a lot more interesting than most fighting games.\nThere's a rough attempt at hanging a story on the gameplay, but it doesn't make much sense. While sometimes it seems like the intent is lost in translation, sometimes it comes through as funny and self-aware.\n\nController support seems fully functional, at least with an Xbox One controller.\n\nI'd pick this up if you're interested for anything under $7, depending on how much you like the premise. Much more than that and you'll probably feel like you didn't get your money's worth.","September 14, 2015","true","0.7"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

Unlike more recent games, NEO AQUARIUM -The King of Crustaceans- does not baby its players thus, creating an environment where the player must learn to survive through strategy and intuition.... true virtues of the Crustacean King himself. The game throws you right into the action to fend for yourself in the ocean's depths, which authentically illustrates what it is like for many crustaceans just after hatching and beginning their life as zooplankton before transcending into glorious armor plated behemoths. With biological authenticity and immersion ensured, put yourself in the lobsters shell... and go forth on a journey to experience the cycle of life -slaughter and consumption- and find what it truly means to be THE KING OF CRUSTACEANS.\n\nGO FORTH AND TASTE DESTINY","June 14, 2015","true","6.3"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","67","8","12","4","0"

Each creature is unique and has its natural predators and weaknesses.  You can unlock a variety of creatures and it really drives you to play more and more. The gameplay is pretty slow due to it being under what and some fights can seem exceedingly one-sided, but with practice you and rush through enemies that gave you a hard time in minutes instead of half an hour. The story is mostly in the beginning and in EX mode, and it is not much but this is not really focused on story anyway. For me this game has provided hours on entertainment and it is worth the cost.

It may look weird at first, but it's actually a top-notch mecha game. With crabs.\n\nThe game is usually played by "C"ommanding a bunch of sea critters that aid you in battle, while destroying or counter-commanding their critters. Destroying them gives you a power pickup which fills your POW meter and increases your maximum POW the next time you "S"hed. Then you hold down "X" to charge up a POW-drainign special.\n\nCorn barnacles drop the pickup all over the place, so if you have trouble fighting them... Just press "Ctrl" to toggle out of the camera lock-on, hold "Z" to lock onto those POW-dispensers, and either hold or mash "Z" (depending on your character) while side-stepping their shots. Shed into POW-3 and rip them apart.\n\nA possible con is that this game might have too much depth. Err, of mechanics, not the ocean.","July 31, 2015","true","2.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

To my surprise combat is not between 2 crustaceans, but they have "minions" that can be picked up and moved, you can even steal your opponents minions to fight for you or kill them to gain precious power for combating your enemy. Getting your LVL3 ability off is actually difficult and learning to use each one is part of the unique challenge.

You can even pick up ally and enemy sea critters and swing them around as you engage in whatever crustacean you are battling. I personally prefer to play as the Hermit crab since he has the 1-2 snail sync combo.\n\nAs you progress, you unlock a few new creatures to play as, including a Snow crab, an underwater diver and a Japanese waifu.\n\nI was really excited to take my skills online, unfortunately, there are not enough Neo Aquarium fans online and I could not find one single opponent. The offline crabs will have to do.\n\nThis game gets a crab in a shell from me.","December 3, 2015","true","1.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
