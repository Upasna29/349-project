I see no end to this spread of cancer as long as weeaboos and idiots like myself keep buying these titles that are simply copy / paste. They most likely have no intentions of improving their games, they rush these baztard babies out drooling as they think of the money they can make.\n\nProtip to the Developers: Move on to new things, not even the 10 year old weeaboos will buy this sh*t forever. At least go out with some bit of dignity before everyone else finally realize that they've been buying the same game every time, before everyone jumps on the "hate" wagon and start demanding for actual quality. You need to know when to back out, before this goes too far and you morons start releasing games for every season and for every holiday there is.\n\nI think that most rational people can see by now that these games are only giving a bad reputation for the Visual Novel Genre. Go buy Clannad for fifty bucks, might be five times more expensive but it's also fifty times better than any Sakura game ever.\n\nI can only imagine what the future of Winged Cloud will look like:>Sakura Easter\n>Sakura 9/11\n>Sakura kill yurself\n>Sakura suicide school\n>Sakura pls buy our games\n>Sakura please let this series die already\n\nI mean, we all love waifus, breasts and butts but, just please..\n\nLET IT DIE FOR GODS SAKE, LET IT DIE.

I'll admit, these games are super cheesy and serve one purpose; however, the previous versions in the Sakura series had steam cards, actual characters, real conflicts, decent (albeit cheesy) plot/story.\n\nI think one of the major complaints about the Sakura games was that the choices didn't really affect much, but in this one, you consistently have 3 choices that lead you onto 4 different paths. That sounds cool, right? Wrong. The paths are just as formulaic, uninteresting, and identical as the other.\n\nThe artwork for this game was drastically different, and I did not think it was for the better. There were less scenes overall, and the human artwork looked way worse than any of the other ones so far.\n\nSakura Spirit had mysteries to solve and each of the 4 girls had character. Sakura Swim Club was dark in nature and had much better dialog. Sakura Angels and Sakura Fantasy were a bit underwhelming compared to the previously mentioned 2, but holy smokes, they blow Sakura Santa out of the water.\n\nDefinitely not purchasing any more Winged Cloud products that come out following this one if this is the direction that they're taking.","December 26, 2015","false","10.0"," 70 of 102 people (69%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","69","70","102","5","5"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mandragoran/recommended/421700/","mandragoran","Vgk","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mandragoran/","261 products in account","Sakura Santa is an interactive story driven RPG developed by Winged Cloud Entertainment  and is the 8th game in the Sakura series. I had low expectations going into this game after the disaster that was Sakura Beach 2. Instead what I got was one of the best RPG experiences I've ever had\n\nGAMEPLAY\n\nSakura Santa has one of the best gameplay systems I've seen in a long time. The deceptively simple clicking based movement and combat paired with the vast open world is almost nostalgically reminiscent of many early MMO's such as Runescape and Ultima Online. Much of the gameplay is dependent on exploring the massive Sakura world and what a world it is. The world is filled with detail and has many hidden treasures and relics for the player to find, and I found myself constantly losing myself for hours distracting on doing the various side quests found far off the beaten path or just wandering through this beautiful world.\n\nSTORY\n\nSakura Santa has an incredibly engaging story filled with rich characters and well paced concise story arcs.  This is one of the few RPG's in which the choices you make throughout your various adventures actually matter and affect the story in a deep and meaningful way.  Your choices matter and affect not only the main character, who's name I can't remember right now, but all your companions will also be notable affected and changed over time by every decision you make.  The characters all also prove to be incredibly memorable and complex. Whereas in many other RPG's that put heavy emphasis on exploration and world building, such as Skyrim and Fallout 4, most of the side characters prove to be flat, dull, and exist only to keep you moving along from quest to quest, in Sakura Santa every character you encounter is deep and complex filled with their own motivations, pasts, quirks, and personalities. The sheer scale of the world, characters and the story rivals even Bioware's  great epics like Dragon Age and Mass Effect.\nThat isn't to say there aren't any problems with the story  and pacing in Sakura Santa. The game suffers from something that has plagued most other Sakura games in the past, an almost drudgingly slow start. Albeit while the start of the game may seem to drag on for a while this is a forgivable offense as it is during this time that a massive amount of world building takes place which is used to establishe critical plot points later on.\n\nAESTHETICS\n\nThe environments and landscapes throughout the game look absolutely amazing and are rendered incredibly quickly. One thing that stands out and sets this game  aesthetically apart from other RPG's would have to be the characters. Winged cloud's art team has outdone themselves everything from the sheer amount of face polygons to the incredible level of detail in all the different outfits the characters wear is simply astonishing.  Not only does this game look great but it is optimized to be ran on just about any  setup. The "anime-esque" art style chosen by the developers allowed them to make a beautiful game while still not demanding very many resources to run;  I was able to run this game on max settings with an i7 and quad SLI titans at a consistent  30 FPS without any problems.\n\nFINAL VERDICT\n\n9.5/10\nThis game isn't perfect but the few gaffs it has can easily be forgiven and forgotten by the many things this game does right.\n\n\nAlso because boobs","January 29","true","0.5"," 12 of 19 people (63%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","63","12","19","16","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Skkype/recommended/421700/","Skkype","Michael_SK","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Skkype/","66 products in account","Not as great as you would expect...\nAfter I played Sakura Swim Club (the hentai version not on Steam, giggity), I thought that the other Sakura games before it had so much to offer. I am beginning to really question that after playing the latest Sakura game: Sakura Santa. Unlike Sakura Swim Club, there are 4 different endings instead of 1. The problem I see is that it's way to simple to get these endings. You basically have to spend the most time with one of the three girls to get their ending or spend an equal amount of time with them to get the harem ending. The simplicity in achieving these endings makes the game seem way more cheap and under-developed it is for the price you pay.\n\nThere is some decision-making... but no conversation decision-making, which is another disappointment. The dialogue throughout this game is also dry and unrealistic, making it a drag to read (especially out loud for a playthrough). I'd have to say the only good thing about this game is the artwork, which is as great as Sakura Swim Club's artwork. The music was okay for this game, but I prefer Sakura Swim Club's soundtrack. The character designs in dialogues are kind of weird in my opinion and seem copied from Sakura Swim Club. The stories were great and are even better if you enjoy child-like fiction.\n\nI enjoyed playing this game, but didn't like how much of a setback this was compared to Sakura Swim Club. It's a pricy game for how under-developed and poorly worked on it is especially without any hentai/nudity, meaning I don't recommend buying this game even if it weren't on sale.

This game now references objects that have appeared in other Sakura games which means that the "Sakura Universe" is actually a thing now with the games taking place in the same world. Incredible or terrifying? You decide.\n\n2. This game breaks away from the standard oblivious male main character to one who understands advances immediately then proceeds to reference itself by having the main character say he doesn't understand how harem protagonists are that dense. Hilarious or poor attempt at self-referential humor? You decide.\n\nSakura Santa might be the "best" of the Sakura titles to date. It does everything you expect out of a Sakura game without insulting the player like the recent Beach titles have done, it thankfully doesn't use the same/poor/unfunny trope jokes every other line (aside from all three girls being shameless/oblivious/finding themselves in suddenly lewd situations) like Beach 2 abused, every character doesn't have a tragic backstory, the ecchi scenes aren't as forced feeling as they were in some of the previous titles (they still are of course it still is the genre after all), and like the other Sakura titles it ends on a light-hearted note with a message about the importance of friends and/or family or what-have-you.\n\nThe artist in this one is Inma again (same as beach), but when the characters are wearing clothes the art is actually much better than in the beach series. Go figure.\n\nThe music is decent too. The loops are still short and aren't seamless, but the overall "listenability" of the tracks is pretty okay.\n\nThe choices do matter in this one changing large chunks of the story up, but since you can mix up the different parts of the story you're able to do almost all the choices in one route. A lot of smaller side conversations do change though depending on the order you take and they are all actually fairly well done and can be completely missed which is a huge plus from the previous titles. Genuinely fantastic work on that part I was impressed with it considering how the trend was basically "fewer or  basically meaningless" choices the last two games.\n\nThe comedy is actually vastly improved in this one too with brilliant lines like:\n\n"I knew that foxes couldn't be trusted especially foxes with huge boobs and nice thighs."\n\n"H.P. Lovecraft's stories all discussed Eldritch abominations, but did he ever contemplate the panties of a fox girl?"\n\n*Right after Sexy Santa comes in through your window in the afternoon* "Why didn't you just use the door?" "I got nervous so I took the easiest route to your apartment." "Okay. That's fair enough."\n\nAnd the best one of the bunch:\n\n"Dads always have the best ideas"\n\nSimply brilliant.\n\nIt also ends with a nice Merry Christmas note from the devs so Merry Christmas Winged Cloud!\n\nCan I recommend this game? You pretty much know if you like this series by now. I can definitely say that this one is the best Sakura game if only for the "Three Moe Stooges" harem ending but is that really saying much? If you only like the Sakura games for being porn though (No one actually does or things that this is what they are about right?) you'll be disappointed.","December 26, 2015","true","4.5"," 8 of 18 people (44%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","44","8","18","2","0"

I've played all but one of the Sakura games, and each one I play I try to find the best parts of the game. I felt that some of them had no good parts at all.\n\nLuckily Sakura Santa seems different so far. Winged Cloud has finally moved away from their staple 2 archetypes (the tsundere and the bubbly "other one") and at last seems to be attempting to create real characters again. I'm quite impressed with the character of Akina so far in particular.\n\nSakura Santa is a slice of life game, but it may have some supernatural elements in it as well, which is something I felt was lacking from the last 3 Sakura games. In my opinion, Fantasy was the best of the Sakura games, and this one definitely seems to have taken a small amount of influence from Fantasy.\n\nWhether this review continues to be accurate throughout the game remains to be seen, but my first impressions are very positive.","December 21, 2015","true","6.0"," 28 of 81 people (35%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","35","28","81","5","4"
