The reason why you should not buy this is the following:\nThis game uses not steams licensing model. You need to enter a Serial-Code to unlock it. You get one of them when you buy the game through steam. But as soon do a clean reinstal (for example new OS setup), you have to enter the key again and you get a message saying "The key is already in use". I contacted their support three times (with 2-3 weeks between every email) to ask them to reactivate my key. They just ignore you and dont answer. Even when I thread them in the 3rd mail to take legal steps they just ignore you and don't answer.\nAfter that I contacted Steam support and asked for a refund, as I obviously paid for a product I can't use now. They just told me I have to contact the Ikarus (author company of aeroflyFS)...\n\nTo this day I still have this game in my library that I waste 50$ on and cant use it because of their bad customer support.\nPlease do not buy this and do not support such a company!

The idea was to be in a Visual Flight Rules (VFR) airplane and familiarize myself with flying, but skip (unknown) procedural parts. aerofly FS isn’t a full flight simulator like MFSX or X-plane, but to my opinion, it succeeds very well in introducing VFR flying. Flight dynamics are accurate; I spent most in-game time in the Cessna 172 Skyhawk, flying VFR over Switzerland, and landing/taking off at all airstrips. I use real VFR circuit patterns and airspace classification information to add to the experience, and just fly VFR flights from one place to the other. I also do a bit of airwork, e.g. maneuvers (stall recovery, steep turns, slow flight, crosswind landings) and procedures (emergency, circuits), but lack of resistance of joystick/pedals and lack of G-force loadings are not making the experience very close to the real deal. But none of these is the game's fault. In that regard, I miss other AI traffic, radio telephony with ATC, simple procedures (e.g. start the engine, turn on landing lights, VOR navigation), and maybe recording capacities. Few additions are planned, but it is still unclear when and how they will be released. Nevertheless, I love flying & I love aerofly FS.

First thing i noticed when i was in a plane, there is not one button in the cockpits you can touch, something i love to do is start my planes on my own. You can't even assign keys to like Fuel Pump and such. The game just tosses you on the runway and thats it. There is also no Air Traffic Control and the world is completely dead, there is no traffic what so ever, no other planes, cars, or boats. The towns are also complete wastelands, it looks like they just took google earth scenery from Switzerland and placed them on the game world, and the only place where you can find some buildings is the airports. The graphics look nice but the scenery when you are up close are not nice to look at. From kilometers in the air, they look nice but on the ground not at all, at one point i was taxing off the runway onto a road that looked like someone took a smear of grey that was the road on a smear of green that was suppose to look like grass.

Fuel mixtures, Air Traffic Control, A.I. aircraft and Autopilot are amongst a handful of things that are simply not present in Aerofly FS. It is very clear that Aerofly is meant to be a VFR simulator, with its comparatively small gameworld, small range of aircraft, and lack of radio communication, and whilst this is ultimately all-right, it may deter more experienced simmers from investing a lot of time into it.\n\nDespite lacking in a detailed simulation, however, Aerofly FS has understood and captured the joys of flying and sight-seeing very well. And with its simple control-scheme and variable flight dynamics, its a considerable investment for someone looking to get into the flight-simulation genre.","August 19, 2015","true","14.6"," 15 of 16 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","15","16","0","0"

The detail on the aircraft itself is impressive, ranging from seeing the steering components actually move to minimal, but visible, damage on the airplane. Landing and taking off is simplified.\n\nThe biggest issue I have with Aerofly is the quality of the environment. Clouds are not highly detailed and the ground is very barren. The occasional cluster of buildings you might fly over (or through), are the "large cities," while the rest of the landscape has nothing besides Google Earth-like textures. The mountains are nicely done though.\n\nOverall, if you are looking for an easy to pick up, quick to learn flight sim, it's hard to do better than Aerofly FS, but if you are looking for a serious, challenging, realistic flight simulator, look elsewhere, such as MS flight sim. It will entertain you, but not really challenge you.","December 29, 2013","true","14.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

The flightmodels are absolutely magnificent a very close replica to the real world equivalents. The default scenery is the best I have ever seen in a flight sim by a large margin especially on the highest of settings. Its a shame that you can only fly within one area and other world locations arent currently present. The number of default aircraft is slightly limited all thoughh it appears there are DLC aircraft available to purchase created by Just Flight (Only 2 at the moment). There is no AI so you are literally flying around by yourself, on a similar note there is currently no multiplayer mode available. That being said I think it is due to be added in the next version/ patch. The weather physics (e.g. Wind) is absolutely brilliant, it feels very much like real life especially through the valleys where there are updrafts and downdrafts & thermals etc, very good. The user interface is easy to use and looks decent. There is good controller detection support as well & the game in general is very easy to setup.\n\nAs im sure others have posted it's a great starter or casual sim experience. It is worth noting its simulation experience is probably not on the same level as some products such as FSX, P3D & X-Plane but it is still an excellent product in its own unique way. Would deffinetly recommend to others.\n\nCheers","August 20, 2014","true","21.0"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/eladalfassa/recommended/214130/","eladalfassa","elad","http://steamcommunity.com/id/eladalfassa/","212 products in account","TL;DR: One of the worst flight simulators I've every played.\n\nI've been a fan of Flight Simulators ever since I played Microsoft Flight Simulator X back in 2007, and have been playing various simulators ever since.\n\nAerofly looks decent, has neat graphics, and looked promising. I managed to fly (and land) the Cessna quite easily.\nSo what's my problem with this game?\n\nI guess my standards are too high. Flight Simulator X had dozens of planes, and allowed me to fly anywhere in the world. aerofly has a much smaller selection of planes and airport, which was disappointing.\n\nThe fact that you can break various parts of your plane (mostly the wings) when crashing looks visually good, but it usually makes no sense: if I slam on the ground too hard, my wings shouldn't fall off. I'd expect an explosion, or my plane stopping to work, but having my wings fall off and the rest of my plane rolling around makes no sense at all.\nWhile we're at the subject of crashing, crashing planes is where the physics engine of this game really shows how bad it is: I don't know if you watched Air Crash Investigation or saw footage from real plane crashes, if you would you would see crashing in this game is nothing like that. when I crash in game, my plane is thrown back into the air upside down, falls again and then the game restarts.\n\nThe planes in game were too easy to manouver and did not feel right. The controls are extremely senetive and the planes react so quickly as if they are unaffected by gravity, wind or drag. Calling this a simulation is like calling Just Cause 2's flight mechanics a simulation: it's a balant lie.\n\nOn the subject of simulation, there's no Air Traffic Control, no failure simulation, no ability to start in a parking lot and drive your plane there, no control over most of the detailed plane subsystems (Compared to other simulators which allowed me to turn off the engine, or cut off one of the fuel tanks, enable navigation radios, or set trim...).\n\nSo my bottom line: not really worth 40$ (and I'm starting to think it wasn't worth the 20$ I paid for it when it was on sale).","December 3, 2013","false","0.6"," 13 of 29 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","13","29","0","0"
