"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rancourt/recommended/311010/","rancourt","Dusty Rancourt","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rancourt/","2088 products in account","A game that sets out to rebottle some of the lightning of Eric Chahi's groundbreaking Another World has some pretty big shoes to fill. There have been attempts to craft another game in its vein, ranging from the attempted direct sequel Heart of the Alien to the famous and well-regarded spiritual successor Flashback, and while many of these games are quite fun, I'd be hard-pressed to call any of them, even Flashback, equals to Chahi's masterpiece. Another World was simply without rival. I just completed it, and I can say with confidence that this game is indeed Another World's most worthy successor to date. This is the game I've been waiting for, and were I Eric Chahi, I'd be quite flattered by it.\n\nLet me begin with a single caveat: this game demands a modern gamepad with dual analog sticks. Certain scenes are demanding enough with one, but nigh-unbeatable with keys, and I haven't found a good way to control some of the later powers acquired in the game without analog sticks. One particular chase sequence, affectionately called "The Nope" by some players...well, let's just say that I *did* complete it before switching to gamepad, and I consider that to be one of my greatest feats of gamer-fu to date. Save yourself the trouble: grab a modern gamepad to play this one.\n\nEven during its "easy" first level, the game's no slouch, and expects you to think on your toes, to put together a large collection of data and refer to it while remaining unseen by various mechanical "eyes," and to solve some downright puzzly problems. This is a new element that The Way brings to the table, something that neither Another World nor Flashback explored much -- both the stealth elements and the puzzle elements add a forced "mental gear change," and I found myself enjoying the regular flips between twitch action and strategic planning quite enjoyable. This would have been easy to get wrong, but The Way, so far, has done a splendid job marrying its alma mater to entirely new territory. The puzzle difficulty is quite demanding, but has never yet felt unfair or even unreasonably taxing. (MABEC will surely earn some choice curse words from some players, but in this reviewer's humble opinion, it was merely demanding, not unreasonable.)\n\nThe visual design is quite beautiful. It's not quite as smooth as Another World's flat plane of polygons-under-glass, but I don't find that I mind the shift to painted pixels at all -- they're beautiful, and used to great visual effect, with a great deal of information conveyed in, at times, one or two pixels. The levels scroll, unlike Another World and Flashback, but I don't find that I mind this at all; it helps the player map the space, and the relationships between rooms and areas. The lighting effects are particularly beautiful, and quite subtle to boot. I might have liked to see our protagonist have additional Broderbund-like fluidity of movement, but that might have come about at cost to timing and responsiveness. The Way's controls are very responsive, and when the protagonist missed a jump, I never felt the game was to blame, only my own clumsiness. That impressed me -- the balance of "forgiving" and "demanding" felt just right for a first level, and reminded me a lot of Another World's. This is not an easy game, but it's self-aware, knows this, and difficulty ramps nicely over time.\n\nThe autosave feature bookmarks the game at certain milestones on your path, and additionally, keeps a journal of your deliverables, much like a modern RPG, so you can easily check to see what's left undone to proceed. I had worried this might diminish my sense of accomplishment figuring out what the game asked of me, but the game remains minimal in its "instructions" there. The "task list" is just helpful enough, and easy to disregard completely if you prefer to play by memory alone.\n\nI've heard of people beating the game after nine hours of play, but I suspect that's quite aggressive and not typical for a first-time player. It took me nearly twenty-five hours to complete, and that amount of playtime for the price is excellent, much greater than Flashback's, let alone Another World's.\n\nEverything I wanted to see from Another World was there -- the breakneck chases, the deadly and unforgiving alien world, the myriad causes of the protagonist's sudden deaths, the pixel-perfect frustrating jumps and dodges, the haunting, atmospheric yet minimal soundtrack. But so many things I didn't expect were in there, too -- stealth-action elements, Machinarium/The Dig-style heavier puzzles, and a richness and broadness to the world that really made it worth the two-years-past-deadline wait. This game was clearly its creators' prize jewel, and the attention to its faceting and polishing cannot be missed. In that one respect, it's more like Another World than even Flashback -- it is very recognizably a personal magnum opus, an expression of love for a genre rarely visited these days. In that one respect above all others, this is well and truly the game Another World fans have been waiting to play for years.\n\nIt's not just "Another World, one more time." It's the modern child of Another World, and it is both aware of its lineage and responsibility to its fans, but also determined to be remembered as more than simply a "cover band" of its alma mater's greatest hits. This is, put simply, everything I wanted The Way to be, and some things I didn't yet realize I wanted from it.\n\nBrilliant. This is the Another World spiritual successor we've been waiting for.\n\n[EDIT: Minor updates acknowledging that I've since completed the game.)","May 20","true","25.3"," 68 of 71 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","68","71","0","9"

You did an amazing job, the way lighting and shadows were applied to every object in the game was purely brilliant, i found myself many times just stopping from actually playing, just to enjoy the beautiful view.\n\n\nThis small reading journey ends here, i expressed everything i felt i need to.\nPros\nPerfect atmosphere and music\nBeautiful story that most of you might bond with\nActive developers that do care about bugs and really work on them\nCons\nThe checkpoints where the game saves your progress aren't perfect\nControls can be a little clunky\nYou can't use both gamepad/mouse at the same time (If you want to do a part of the game with the mouse, you have to switch that in the settings)\nMy rating for it would be a solid 80/100, and i do encourage you to try this one if you enjoy puzzles, beautiful atmosphere, and simple but powerful stories.","May 29","true","5.0"," 17 of 18 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","17","18","0","0"

I am a huge fan of Out of this World (or 'Another World'), Flashback, and Heart of Darkness as well as any games of the like. So when I saw the description for this game and watched the trailer I picked it up.\n\nThe story is captivating while the art is immersive. The music gives a beautiful backdrop for the scenery and lends a very touching effect to the ending in particular. While the gameplay gets the job done there are certain puzzles that could have been designed in a more graceful manner. I encourage players to seek out help on discussion boards when they hit walls in this game because I wouldn't want them to be held back from the full experience.\n\nThe difficulty is manageable though there are a couple events that can obstruct progress in a frustrating manner, namely a Battletoad like sequence as well as a bullet hell encounter. The former can be overcome in a few tries although it feels cheap. The latter can be very aggravating but it is meant as a build up, which in that context makes it understandable.\n\nAll-in-all, I enjoyed what the game brought to the table and I'd say the dev team succeeded in their goal of providing a Heart of Darkness/Another World-like experience, albeit with more puzzles than usual. I suggest this game for players with similar tastes.","May 22","true","7.6"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","15","17","0","1"

There is relatively little gunplay in the game, and most enemies and obstacles are overcome by indirect means.\n- Some excellent environmental puzzles that make you feel clever when you finally figure them out.\n- Good length. At about 9-10 hours, the games feels appropriately substantial but does not overstay its welcome.\n\nCONS:\n- The story works well for the most part, but the relationship between protagonist and his wife could use some fleshing out (and the wife character in general – she doesn’t have a single line of dialogue and doesn’t even have a name so it’s a bit hard to care for her).\n- Some of the action sequences can be frustrating.","May 21","true","19.4"," 16 of 20 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","16","20","0","1"

My complete video walkthrough of The Way is available in the Steam Community Hub.\n\nAs a backer of this game, I'm ecstatic! This here my friends, is pure nostalgia revisited. They got it just right by bringing us that old school feel, with hard as hell puzzle solving once again. I knew this was going to be amazing when I started looking for my pencil & notepad to mark down some of the puzzles I had to solve. How long has it been since I've done that for any game? I can't even remember!  You also have to revel at those beautifully hand drawn backgrounds which look like they came straight out of a best selling sci-fi novel!\n\nThis gem was completely worth the price, the trouble & the wait. Kudos to Puzzling Dream & PlayWay S.A. for making this masterpiece a reality and such a truly satisfying experience.\n\nPlease tell me you're already working on The Way Part 2!!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/drpixel/recommended/311010/","drpixel","DrPixel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/drpixel/","3729 products in account","Product received for free\n\nWhat would you do to revive a deceased loved one? Perhaps sneak into a high-security warehouse, steal a spacecraft, and traverse through the stars until you reach another planet? Or, would you fight aliens, robots, and even a bounty hunter? Maybe.....just maybe......you would solve puzzles! Oh, the horror!\n\nThe BreakdownSo, silly intro aside, The Way came as a unique surprise for me. See, I'm not very good at both puzzle games and platformers, but I do enjoy playing both of them. I also really love pixel art, so when a game came along that had fantastic pixel art along with an interesting story and puzzle platformer gameplay, I knew I had to check it out. Was it as good as I was hoping? Well....yes, generally.\n\nThe basic narrative of The Way revolves around a scientist of some sort named Tom and his obsession with reviving his deceased wife by any means possible. They apparently both worked at a company that produces spacecraft, and they had previously traveled to another planet to study it and simultaneously look for a "temple of life". Their attempt to find the temple was unsuccessful, but now, Tom decides to steal a spaceship from his company in order to try and use the mythical temple to try and revive his wife. However, the story has a few twists and turns in the form of various obstacles in Tom's way - namely, the hostile creatures of the planet he lands on and the many traps and mysteries that lie in wait for him.\n\nIt's a somewhat decent idea for a story that helps provide some form of motivation for the protagonist to go through all the trials and tribulations that he does. See, The Way was heavily inspired by tough puzzle platformers of the 90s like Another World or Heart of Darkness. This basically means that the game is very difficult and will involve the main character dying quite a bit. In my time playing, I must have died over a hundred times, and for others that number may be much larger. So if you're not comfortable with challenging games, you may want to avoid this game.\n\nYet, for those that are fine with some tough challenges, The Way is certainly both a good puzzle game and a decent platformer. In fact, I'd say that the game is mostly about puzzle solving than anything else, even the story. Most of your time playing the game will be spent solving puzzles of various types. For example, early on you need to find out how to steal spaceship. Later on, the puzzles raise the stakes, but you also gain various abilities like teleportation, telepathy, and a shield to help compensate for the added risk of death. Thankfully, the game is very plentiful with its checkpoints, so after dying it takes mere seconds usually to get back to where you were.\n\nHowever, while I enjoyed the puzzles generally, despite getting stuck quite a few times, I have to specifically point out that the game has a very long and terribly-designed puzzle a few hours into the game (for me it was around 5-7 or so). [Slight spoilers ahead]At that point in the game, a bounty hunter arrives to take you down, since you're now a wanted criminal. However, the game decides to let you puzzle your way through a desert in order to defeat him. He sets up some robots, which are easy enough to take down using a mix of your shield power (to reflect bullets back at the robots) and a dog-like creature you had befriended earlier. Yet, after a while you start climbing up a mountain, where some sort of strange rock and some pipes are. At this point, me and many other players were completely stumped because the game doesn't really provide clues about what to do. It's not clear at all what to do, and to make matters worse, the solution is terribly obtuse. You have to figure out that there's some arrows on a rock that all need to be reversed, which causes water to pour out. From there, you need to backtrack all the way to the bottom of the mountain apparently, where a cave underground will have a small series of switches that change the pipes' rotation, allowing the water to flow into another pipe puzzle that you have to re-trace your steps back to, where you then have to use telepathy to alter the pipes' positions in order to flow water through them to push out a rock for some reason, which you then have to move across the mountain in order to drop it on a robot's head.\n\nExcuse that horrible run-on sentence, but.....I mean, what the hell? How did anyone even figure that out? The puzzle made no sense because the game gave no clues about the cave underground, despite me even exploring it previously. To make matters worse, the whole puzzle itself is just silly. Why did I need to go through all that hell just to get a rock? Why couldn't my character have found a similarly-sized rock to drop on the robot's head, especially considering that the setting at that time in the game was a mountain of all places? It's ridiculous, and the puzzle really soured my experience by that point. It made me not want to continue because of how obtuse and frustrating it was, and honestly it took way longer than it should have just to get through that section. The game's other puzzles were logical and made sense in the context of their situations. That particular one though was a nightmare, and definitely was a blemish on the overall game experience for me.\n\nDespite that however, the game has many praiseworthy aspects, especially it's visual style and soundtrack. The game has very high quality pixel art, and many scenes were not only memorable but also fascinatingly beautiful. A simple walk through a rain-covered graveyard or a hug during a sunset on an alien planet were transformed into pixelated beauty by this game's developers. Honestly I'd love to see more sprite work from whoever did the pixel art because it's just so damn good. Similarly, the game's soundtrack really helped add to the atmosphere of each scene.....generally. I will say though that the song that plays during the mountain area (where I got frustrated beyond belief by the puzzle design) got to be a little annoying after 2 hours of being in there. Regardless, the game is still pretty solid musically and definitely a joy to behold in terms of its visuals.\n\nProsThe pixel art is absolutely beautiful and really brings the game's world to life\nFans of puzzle platformers like Another World or Heart of Darkness will probably really enjoy this game for its extremely difficult yet rewarding gameplay/puzzles\nMost of the game's soundtrack helps add to the ambience and overall feel of each area\nThe game's story, while not superb or overly original, is fairly interesting and does provide adequate motivation for the main character going through all the difficult situations he faces\nThe game takes 10+ hours to finish\nSteam achievements and controller support (though a mouse may be needed for certain precision-based puzzles)\nConsThe puzzles can be very frustrating and difficult (with particular mention for one absolutely horrible puzzle involving pipes, water, and a rock)\nSome of the puzzle solutions can be a bit obtuse, while many others require lots of patience (so the impatient may want to avoid this game)\nNo Steam Cloud support for saves (at the time of this writing)\nFor those who aren't comfortable with difficult games, you may want to avoid The Way. However, for fans of puzzle platformers, puzzle games in general, or just really great pixel art, you may want to check this game out. Go revive your wife! Just be prepared to die a lot along the way! ;)\n\nFinal Verdict: 7.5/10","June 5","true","7.6"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","2"

So when I first saw The Way I was filled with that warm glow of nostalgia - a old school puzzle platformer in the style of the Eric Chahi classics. Beautiful alien worlds brought to life with a simple, 2D art style with puzzles designed to challenge you and where everything in the world is liable to kill you.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1R6qSsLJzv0\n\nYes, the story is a little hokey. You whisk away the frozen remains of you dead wife to an alien world in search of the Temple of Life and a "way" to bring her back to the land of the living. It's pretty cheesey but it works and I was hooked enough to want to find out how it all panned out.\n\nThat said, from what I've played so far The Way may mirror those old platformers a little too well. The simplest of things can kill you and the infrequent checkpoints will see you repeating sections over and over again, which can lead to more than a little frustration. Coupled with the somewhat inperfect controls you may be raging after Commader Tom fails to make that ledge grab and falls to his death for the sixth or seventh time.\n\nRegardless this really is a love letter to games like Another World and Flashback.

Prince of Persia, Out of this World/Another World, Flashback, Blackthorn etc. This game might be a tad more forgiving by ditching opressive time limits, and punishing respawn points, but it more than makes up for it a at times, tedious yet fun 2D challenge. One misstep can see you plummet to your doom, accompanied by a sickening crunch. Rush into a dark room too fast and you will pay the price! There are fun puzzels, neat and modern shooting mechanics (where bullets and poor aim, have consequence), and of course platforming, along with well paced metroidvania style exploration. Graphics are just fine and charming, reminiscent and artfully faithful to the 16-bit era. The music is very moody and well composed. The writing drives the story forward in a minimalistic, yet effectively cryptic tone. I would highly recommend this to the old school fans of the consol era and those who appreciate a challenge in the anyone interested in 2D platfroming genres with science fiction setting.

I am pleased to say that it was money well spent.\n\nThe Way is a sci-fi action-platformer with lots of tricky puzzles, tense moments, and gorgeous pixel art. The art is definitely something that will satisfy pixel-art lovers; it's sumptuous and creepy, weird and glorious, immersive and attractive. It feels like a top-tier 256-colour VGA game from the 90s. Obviously, they were going for a vintage look, but what they achieved here is a work of art, no matter your perspective on retro games.\n\nThe first five minutes of the story had me hooked (and successfully pulled me away from Stellaris -- for the moment). They manage to exposit so much information and evoke strong emotions entirely without dialogue. You walk around and little words pop up all over the place, telling you what things are. Some items imply a great deal of emotional depth in the story -- stuff like "bed without her" and "cheap take-out food." The narrative design is really out of the box so far.\n\nThe story is certainly my favourite element, but other things deserve mention. The soundtrack is a great cyberpunk/ambient mix that lends a lot of gravity to each moment. The puzzles are tricky and require some thinking and a little bit of making notes, but none have been so hard as to force me to look for online hints. The enemies are deadly -- most kill with one hit -- but the checkpoints are frequent and the reload time is almost instantaneous. A quick reload time is critical when death is so easy (I'm looking at you, Hyper Light Drifter).\n\nIf you loved games like Another World and Flashback, give this a try.

No, I don’t necessarily have to _love_ it. But I do wish that I could at least enjoy playing it.\n\nI like “The Way”, I really do. The game’s presentation is outstanding and the sad story is captivating enough to make me wanna see how it resolves. A few of the puzzles are interesting and well thought out, and almost every background view would make for an incredibly beautiful painting.\n\nSadly, I can’t find the motivation or willpower to continue playing... Not after having died and respawned at _the same friggin’_ spot way more times than I should have to put up with. I remember doing this way back in the 90’s as well, playing “Flashback” over and over again, and also “Another World/Out of This World”. Those two games are the main reason why I even backed “The Way” on Kickstarter. But that was then and now is now. As much as I still do love “Flashback” (hey just look at my avatar – which I’ve been using since the beginning of teh Interwebz) and all of its occasionally frustrating gameplay elements, I just can’t help feeling even more frustrated as I experience the same, no I’d even say _worse_ penalty, playing “The Way”.\n\nIt’s not just about lacking the time and patience to do the same part over and _over_ again, which wasn’t that big of a deal when I was a 12-year-old. But I also can’t help but feel that this game somehow deserves more than this, that it should be smarter than penalizing the player like this. It shouldn’t be so much about going back and forth between dying and respawning at a painstakingly old and ill-placed checkpoint. “Platforming” is fun, for sure, and “The Way” does have its moments when it comes to both running-and-jumping as well as the puzzle solving – which _should_ be one of the game’s strongest points. But when I find myself constantly running into poor design choices, leaving me frustrated and annoyed, that’s when I can’t help but think “Don’t I actually have better things to do and more entertaining gaming experiences than this that I could turn to?”\n\n--\nEdit: And I get what many of you are probably thinking right now, that “it’s all about patience”. But no, not it’s not. Not in this case. There’s a huge difference between carefully figuring out how to find that secret door which will let you continue, and simply bashing your head against the wall until it breaks. “The Way” _should_ be more about the first option, but too often do I find myself forced to go with the second one.\n\nIt’s like that one point in “Another World/Out of this World” where you need to press a bunch of buttons in a certain order before time runs out and you die. There’s no logic to this puzzle – you simply keep pressing the buttons until a new set of buttons appear, and try to memorize which button did what so that you’ll become faster on your next try. Although the puzzle fits thematically, seeing as how the game’s protagonist has never seen these type of controls before and thus have no choice but to press buttons at random, it’s not exactly a good one. But since you at least get a checkpoint right before it happens, and also once you’ve finished, it still feels ok. Especially since there aren’t _that_ many buttons which needs to be pressed before the player is allowed to continue playing. Unfortunately, the checkpoints are sparse here in “The Way” and the random elements aren’t that quickly transcended as this particular puzzle which I just described.\n\nAnd that’s the difference between good and poor game design: throwing things at the player that doesn’t require logical thinking or good reflexes, but rather simply feels like a hindrance in order to squeeze out more play-time by throwing something random at you. Kind of like when developers choose to allow the AI to cheat, because it’s easier than programming it to be clever and outsmart you.\n--\n\nAlthough I probably only have another 4 hours left of this game before I finish it, I’ve decided to wait for a “let’s play” series on YouTube instead. I simply cannot watch my character die and respawn another time, or try and solve yet another vague puzzle.\n\nI’m sorry to leave the game like this, but most of all - I’m sad and a bit disappointed at how it all turned out.","May 22","false","7.1"," 49 of 90 people (54%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","54","49","90","3","14"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/minera/recommended/311010/","minera","Gravelfoot","http://steamcommunity.com/id/minera/","444 products in account","Interesting idea and a beautiful artstyle, but done less well. Spoiler Free review, btw..\n\nAnyone who has ever played Flashback or Another World will instantly think of these two games, and to some extent this game emulates the cinematic platformer style from those games. It doesn't do it very well, sadly.\n\nI will say, that the idea behind the abilities you have in the game is good, even if it often fails to be as good as it could be.\n\nIt is hard to go too much into detail without spoiling the game, so I will just go over the things that eventually made me not want to play any more (in ascending order of annoyance):\n\n\nAutosave:\n\n95% of the time the autosave kicks correctly in just before dangerous places, where you most likely will die. The last 5% of the time it saves somewhere far far away from what you are doing beacuse it was triggered by you passing a point it wants to save at and all the danger save spots, which are often one-time save spots, are gone.\n\n\nPuzzle objective:\n\nOften you need to do something very specific to get past an obstacle. In the player's mind there might be myriad of different ways to bypass the problem you are faced with, but since this is a linear game, you need to figure out what the developer wants you to do and that is sometimes very convoluted. Not a big problem, but can be a bit frustrating.\n\n\nPuzzles breaking immersion:\n\nIt starts out with a story that moves you through interesting puzzles that are a natural part of the world (like security you have to get past when trespassing) and then quickly devolves into puzzles that just feel forced into the setting without it making any sense for the puzzle to be there. It detracts from the story and the world and makes it feel much less like a game and more like a flimsy frame for the puzzles.\n\n\nPuzzle feedback:\n\nSome puzzles rely heavily on you understanding what you are doing and how you are interacting with the them. Yet the game often forgets that what is immediately obvious once you figure it out is frustratingly hard to understand if you don't get any feedback from the game when you try the logical solution and something makes it fail.\n\n\nPuzzle design:\n\nSome puzzles have you doing things in one area while the info you need or the reaction to your actions is somewhere far away on the other side of a horde of things that can kill you or just takes a lot of time to get past (falls/enemies/slow climbing/traps/etc.). Some puzzles have you do a lot of things that require that you study an area you can only see in short glimpses unless you (like me) take screenshots. It makes interesting puzzles, that could be fun into colossal time wasters which are frustrating to no end. One puzzle I solved by going through all permutations of possible solutions simply because it would take me more time to go check on the outcome of my actions than just laboriously go through all possible solutions.\n\n\nPlatformer parts:\n\nThis is what finally broke the camel's back for me. There are soooo many parts where you have to traverse long insta-death platformer parts with spikes and falls and things like it. Could be a nice part of the game, but the controls are very imprecise and the physics of the game are strange (Ex: while sliding down an incline you cannot change your speed when you are touching the incline, but you can stop all horisontal movement or speed it up a bit if you jump and use the sideways movement buttons while in the air. It makes no sense). Tiny spikes about 30 cm below you -- can't step down slowly and just walk slowly through them (you can move through them if you stand next to them), you have to jump high up into the air and try to land in that one tiny spot where your character has about 2-3 pixels leeway on both sides or you die.\n\n\nConclusion:\n\nI wanted to like this game. No, I wanted to love it. It just has too many frustrating parts.","May 24","false","7.0"," 17 of 29 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","17","29","0","2"

I love cinematic platformers and the moment I saw this game on Kickstarter I knew that it had great potential to be one of the best in its genre.\n\nThe Way is inspired by games such as Another World and Flashback, and if you have any familiarity with those games then it's hard not to see where the developers took their inspirations from.\n\nThe storyline, while incredibly simple, nonetheless manages to tug hard at the heartstrings. Tom is extremely obsessed with bringing his wife back, no matter the cost, and it's hard not to root for him when you see what he has to go through. The universe in general is really a very fascinating place, and I would definitely love to see more games taking place inside it.\n\nWhile the character animations aren't nearly as complex as the ones featured in its inspirations, The Way still offers a very appealing visual style. The backgrounds are crisp and detailed, and you really get a sense of visiting another world.\n\nThis is an old-school experience, one that offers very little hand holding. The only real tutorials occur at the beginning of the game and offer the most basic movement controls. After that, you're on your own to figure everything else out. The first level alone feels like something that would appear in the mid-to-late portion of other games, and it only gets trickier and more intense from there.\n\nThe Way is one of the most varied games I've played in recent memory. While it is definitely a platformer, it also utilizes aspects of stealth, puzzle, action, and even shooters during the course of the 10 hour adventure. From solving complex puzzles, to sneaking past robots, the game covers a wide ground of concepts and ideas, and always makes sure to keep things fresh throughout the 10 hour adventure.\n\nThe thing that really brings this game together is its incredible soundtrack, which is easily my favorite so far this year. The music has a mystical, alien quality, relying heavily on bizarre synthesizer effects, droning melodies, and haunting production. I would definitely love to listen to this outside of the game, something I can say for very few soundtracks.\n\nThe Way evokes a real sense of awe and wonder, something that seems to be missing from today's market of fast-paced action and over-marketed games. It represents much that was good about gaming in the early 1990s while making sure to keep the experience moving along for 2016 audiences. In short, it's everything the developers promised it would be.","May 23","true","10.3"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

The pixel art and creative level designs are immersive and fun to explore. I liked the puzzles the most, and the platforming is fun, but it would better if the controls were tighter (it's more on the Prince of Persia side of the spectrum than the Super Meat Boy side).\n\nMy biggest complaint is that the gameplay is punctuated by (sometimes very) frustrating parts where there is significant "respawn" time, ie time it takes to just get to where the puzzle/platform is. This game would be a lot more enjoyable if the saves were more frequent. Most saves in this game only fire after certain events, not on your location. For example in a large zone (bounty hunter area), my save was in the bottom right corner of the map, but the current task was a difficult platform sequence in the far upper left. It took about 5 minutes to just get back, and then die, repeatedly, trying to navigate a series of 1-block sized platforms. This ended up taking about 40 min of running/climbing and probably 2 minutes of working on the platforms. This comes up often and is a drag. I hope that this is a mechanic the devs fix in a future patch.\n\nI beat the game and the criticisms of the (current) top reviewer don't seem fair to me. I thought the land cruiser and bullet-hell parts were fun. A bullet-hell sequence where you beat it after a few deaths wouldn't be much of a bullet-hell ( as the final boss no less!). I haven't played the older games so I can't speak to if they're too similar. I do agree with the complaint about the saves, but don't think that negates the overall enjoyable qualities of the game: artwork, world, and fun+challenging puzzles/platforming.","May 22","true","8.6"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","1"

Use of a controller is recommended, although I switched back and forth between controller and keyboard + mouse every now and then.\n\nYou will die a lot in this game. It takes inspiration from cinematic platformers like Another World and Flashback, but the movement is a lot less thoughtful, leading to some clunky, often punishing platforming. There is also quite a bit of combat, so slight word of warning for those expecting a quiet exploration game. Most of the time the balance is fine and while the instant deaths are pretty harsh, the sights and sounds you experience push you on. But you will inevitably hit a few extremely frustrating sequences where you will die over and over and eventually it won't feel like your fault anymore.\n\nThere's some excellent and surprisingly tough puzzles, something I would have liked to see more of. There's genuine feeling of discovery and accomplishment to be had on solving some of them. The soundtrack and environments are superb, with some wonderful alien architecture to get the imagination racing. I would love to see an adventure game from the team, one that combines the world building and artistic and puzzle design talents of the developer, with slightly less punishing gameplay.\n\nUltimately it's a very memorable little game and I'm glad I pledged in the kickstarter. Goodness if I didn't curse very, VERY loudly several times during the game though. I imagine many of the frustrations will be evened out in later patches and people will be able to enjoy the journey better.\n\n7/10","May 21","true","10.1"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

It's just not as responsive as it should be all the time. And on top of that the re-spawn points are a bit far apart in some places, so you can be doing something relatively simple, like jumping accross platforms, make a wrong move and have to go back quite far to retry.

At first I gave the game a very borderline "not recommended" review. There were some things about the game design that myself (and apparently some others) really didn't like, and which were preventing me from enjoying the game. Then within about 48 hours the developers released a patch which blew those problems away. I was really wanting to recommend this game so I'm glad that now I can. And I appreciate the devs tweaking the game based on customer feedback. They didn't have to. The problems and confusion some people have had with the game weren't experienced by everyone. The game was released just as advertised and it's not the devs' problem if it's not some people's cup of tea. But I really think the changes they've been making improve the game for everyone.\n\nThe Way is a platformer and a puzzler and an adventure. It's got a lot of the gameplay from Flashback and Another World. You'll need to do a lot of platforming with some timing and speed challenges included. It's got a fair amount of enemies thrown in, but it never goes full action game. There are also static puzzles of a wide variety like arranging things in the right sequence etc. And a few arcadey sections. It's the arcadey sections which put me off the game on my first attempt. The final one (a bullet hell sequence) proving an insurmountable barrier to beating the game. There was nothing remotely similar to that kind of gameplay in the rest of the game and it felt unfair for the final obstacle of the game to be an abrupt switch to a different genre. The devs ended up making it a lot easier so I've since beaten the game. It's still a bit of an odd choice for the final challenge though. I was expecting something a bit more "Commander Keen" where you have to frantically jump around a level triggering things that zap a boss monster.\n\nI found a few sections of the game a little frustrating but nothing I wasn't willing to come back to. Most of the time this was due to constantly dying in one section, but respawning a fair distance away from that section and having to work my way back to it many times over. The devs have taken peoples' feedback about these areas and I believe they've moved auto save points closer to all the parts that were frustrating me. These parts still provide a challenge and it still feels good to beat them but now it's not so tedious. Sometimes I would even die on purpose just to see if there was a unique death animation for that hazard :)\n\nThe level design is mostly really good. Some of the puzzles interact with each other and are multi-function with different "solutions" depending on what you need to do next. There are a few times when you can't progress until you figure out the trick to interacting with that particular part of the level.\n\nThe story is pretty good. The developer says one of the influences was the Lucasart point and click adventure The Dig. I can see the influence. The Dig was a concept created by Stephen Spielberg with writing by Orson Scott Card though so don't expect anything on quite that level. It's still impressive for three dudes. It's a bit of a trope but it's not too predictable. It's fairly light on text and dialogue and a lot of the story is conveyed by floating captions as your character walks past objects in the level and thinks about them. It really could have used that "cinematic cutscenes" stretch goal though. There are many times when your character just exits one playable location and appears in another playable location. Some illustration of the world in between the places, or even some establishing shots, would help the world building a lot. Some things in the game seem like they're going to be a major part of the plot (e.g. the ship's hologram and the goat man) but nothing happens with them. It makes the story feel a little underdeveloped.\n\nI've seen a lot of games on Kickstarter saying they're "inspired by classic titles" just because they've got some retro aesthetic. This is a rare instance of a developer actually meaning it. If you like games like Another World or Flashback or BlackThorne or The Dig or Indiana Jones and The Fate of Atlantis then you could like this one. Just give the devs another couple of weeks (from mid-May 2016) to iron out the rest of the bugs. I played the game just after launch and apparently I hit a bug where you can actually skip an entire level. 0:40 to 0:47 in the game trailer is stuff I won't see unless I replay the game.","May 21","true","9.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","14"

You will be frustrated, but you should give it a try.\n\nThere are many disappointing aspects about The Way. Controls are not good at all (keyboard movement controls aren't good for platforming and my XBox One controller didn't work for shooting at all even after rebinding the fire button), the save points are badly placed (forcing you to replay large swaths of a level after making one wrong control input at the end of a long sequence), and there are some questionable mechanical decisions (there is a final boss fight which introduces completely new mechanics for some reason). There is a nonsensical "choose an ending" decision at the end of the game, but I cannot imagine the main character thinking there was any option other than the one he had been working toward for the entire game. Some puzzle design is obtuse (ie. you may not even know that there is a puzzle you are supposed to be solving until you die multiple times).\n\nFor a game which calls itself a platformer, the platforming movement feels floaty and awkard. There are moments where the game requires very precise control, but it can be very difficult to translate your intended movement into actual movement in the game.\n\nFor a game which invokes Another World in its marketing, the character sprite animation is not as detailed as it probably should be. Three frames of jump animation for the main player character feels a little lame.\n\nWhile this game was very frustrating at times, I'm glad I played it. The background art is beautiful and creative. The music is exceptional. Even the story, as basic as it is, manages to create some emotion which helps align the player with the main character. I hope that the developers have the opportunity to create another game in the future which can avoid the issues present here.","May 23","true","10.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It is heavily inspired by Another World/Out of this World, Flashback, and Heart of Darkness, platformers from the past whose charm for me lies in using atmosphere instead of plot to tell a story, and in creating very unique organic scenes that don't feel like a bunch of mechanics thrown together. This is a blessing and a curse, both in these older games and in The Way. They have emulated the style so well that even some of the clunky controls have been carried over.\n\nThe game is divided up into sequences, those sequences existing in a few separate scenes. Each sequence has it's own unique twist. What you learn in one sequence may or may not help you in the next. This keeps you learning new things and keeps you on your toes, but the downside is you never feel like you are mastering a system. Some of the controls like aiming and jumping, which you would expect to be very responsive and feel freeing, can be restrictive and clunky here. But for the most part, the game is designed around these clunky systems, and fall in line with a main character who is not an action hero. Expect a lot of memorization of the exact timing and actions to take to get through the next challenge. There is also some pretty fun puzzle solving.\n\nThe story is light, but provides enough motivation to keep working through the game, even during some of the more frustrating sections. You will be cursing as you go back to the last, just barely too far away, checkpoint, but then you will push ahead for more.\n\nThe graphics are old-school but gorgeous, especially on a large screen. There is a lot of detail and animation in the environments. The music and sound design work with the graphics to provide the appropriate otherworldly mood - a mood which I haven't quite felt since Flashback. For me, Another World is still king of this subgenre, but The Way largely succeeds in creating a similar and engaging adventure.","May 20","true","2.4"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

Two years ago, in 2014, I didn't know exactly what to expect of it, besides being a homage to Another World, Flashback and Heart of Darkness. Now, two years later, I can say it's more of a homage, it's truly a game that evolves on the spirit and gameplay of those games. It has action and puzzles, but as the game progress, the puzzles are less about action and speed, and more about understanding and planning what to do next. Also, it's a very heartwarming story right from the title screen, showing how far the main character is willing to go. While the game has some textual narrative, most of the storytelling is done with visual clues, showing the passage of time and adding weight to the emotional aspect of the storytelling.\n\nFrom the gameplay aspect, the action sequences are well done, when a sequence starts, the player has little time to figure it out what to do, and usually just one chance to do it right. Any failure is instakill, but the game has a good amount of checkpoints for a less punishing gameplay, even if they aren't always where you wish they were. The tools the player has at his disposal changes as the game progresses, forcing the player to take a different approach in the action sequences. Thus, the game is always fresh, never getting too old, never getting too easy, never failing to punish a bad decision and always being an emotional journey. For me, it's a 10 out of 10 for anyone who loves oldschool platform titles.","May 22","true","10.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Sounds cut out constantly. Looks like you can remap controls, but twist, some buttons can't be remapped -- for example, if you try to put your "open powers" button (a button weirdly listed as "next weapon" in the controls menu) to the left trigger, it makes the left trigger the "fire weapon" button. Wat? Also, the run button never worked -- I just ran always even with always run off. Weird.\n\nFinally got to a puzzle I didn't get at all, and just didn't care enough to keep going anymore.

This is exactly for fans of Another World, Flashback or old adventure games.\nI absolutely love this game. Controls, music, sounds, story, graphics...just everything. It´s SO WELL DONE!!! Iˇve never seen such a great retro style game. It´s almost like a game, You forgot to play, when You were young and You finally got to play it.\nThere are lot of great puzzles, but not any non-sense BS. It makes You think hard and the result is always satisfying.\nI must say, this game really is challenging. Puzzling and platforming is really traveling back in time, when it comes to difficulty, but with a little effort, it´s still pleasure to play. There are checkpoint, but always far enough to keep You on Your toes.\nI would like to stress one thing, platforming and controls are not bad, like I read in some reviews. No...this is exactly how these games are meant to be played. I won´t spoil anything here, but be sure, this game catches You and it won´t let You take a brake. Music is outstanding and I´m gonna search for OST. Graphics and animations...amazing. It doesn´t matter it´s old style pixelated graphics, animations are well executed and look awesome.

Overall, it tries to capture the look and feel of these old classic games, and mostly captures it. I really applaud the developers on their effort especially considering this is an indie title designed by a couple of people.\n\nHowever, some puzzles and action pieces of the game are (as of the current version) really awful. The game presents itself as a very atmospheric adventure game with some puzzle elements, but in some cases it turnes into a Nintento hard, frustrating memorization game with extremely precise hit detection that tries to tire you down into rage quitting it.\n\nPros:\n- Extremely good visuals and on par soundtrack.\n- Captivating environments that goes hand in hand with the story.\n- Kind of classic but well-executed storyline.\n- Some level of drama that makes you care for the characters.\n\nCons:\n- Some of the most infuriating puzzle and platforming sequences I've seen for some number of years.\n- From time to time you forget that you are playing a story-driven adventure game but a game with silly frustrating puzzles.\n- In some cases, horrible pixel precise hit detection.\n- Too few cut scenes that makes you want more of the story.\n\nIn short, I recommend the game but really you have to be a patient player to overcome some of the puzzles and platforming elements. On the other hand, if a new player wants to recapture the adventure puzzle games of early 90's with all its bizzare and frustrating puzzles, look no further than "The Way"\n\nP.S. to developers: I think "The Way" has been a very poor choice of name since it is so common of a game name element, when searching for a content for the game on the Internet, it mixes up with a ton of other games.\n\n\n","May 30","true","9.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It is not a very good game too.\nIn fact, it has good ideas, good story, gorgeous graphics ... but plenty of flaws which ruin the fun.\n\nOne of the biggest flaw of the game is the controls, very rigid, very approximate ; and the biggest flaw is the fact that the game features plateform, shooting, and even actual bullet hell sequences, with its controls which are totally unsuitable for such stages. Result : there is far, far, more frustration than fun.\n\nIn other flaws, I find that the level-design brings too much (really too much!) useless goings and comings, like to artificially expand the lifetime ; lots of puzzles are dull (but some are excellent!) and too many are poorly directed ; lots of moment are boring (when you have to cross a large wall, moving slowly from ladders to ladders and patiently waiting for sandfalls to stop... or repetitive sequences against the robots... :/).\n\nThe good points of the game: its story ! The gorgeous graphics and ambiance. And some really good puzzles.\n\nSo, overall, is it a good game ? Maybe ; if you are curious AND lenient.\nDo I recommand it ?

I backed this game, but later forgot about it, so when I started playing I had absolutely no recollection of the plot, what little I might have known. That was a good thing: this game has probably the BEST beginning half-hour I've seen since the first half of Wall-E. No words, no dialogue, just the acts and thoughts of the main character, and they tell you everything that you need to know in order to empathise with him. This feeling of discovery actually lasts for quite a while, since even after getting to the alien planet I was amazed by everything that I came into contact with, like a genuine explorer of a new world... that is, until I left the first part of the game, which I call "Story World", and I arrived at "Puzzle World".\n\n--------------------------------- SPOILER ALERT --------------------------------\n\nFrom this moment on, the plot just sits patiently in a corner until you're done with the puzzles, then tells you a little bit of how the story goes on, then sits again to let you jump, climb, teleport and move green pieces all around. This is when the game started to lose me, but I pressed on, mainly because the story was interesting, but also because the puzzles were, at times, really damn ingenious. There are some here and there where I just had to roll my eyes in disbelief (Sliding puzzles? Really?), but they were really interesting to crack for the most part.\n\nThen we arrive at the third part of the game, "Action World", where high precision jumps are the norm and hundreds of deaths are the punishment for failure. This is where the writers' inspiration seems to have run out: the last thing I expected to see in a heavily dramatic, plot-driven game such as this one is a stage where you have to fight the Purple Tentacle from Maniac Mansion and the zombie pirate LeChuck. Yes, I know, "it's an hommage", right? Well, for me, an hommage is a picture in the background, a statue on the floor, or a few notes of a recognisable tune, not modelling an action level of your dramatic game with characters from other games, brilliant and influential as they might be. And having a bullet hell stage as the final boss, in a game with a plot that doesn't really need any kind of "final boss", is just lazy writing to me.\n\nFinally, at the end of the story it is revealed that the "immortality solution" which the main character has been searching all his life is just storing a person's mind in a computer, something which I'm pretty sure that his own society already had the ability to do. I mean, they have perfected interstellar travel and full-body stasis chambers, yet they can't make a copy of the neuronal network of a person? It just doesn't make sense. And the ending? A few still images transitioning from one to another. That's it. No emotion at all. Oh, and the worst part: a cliffhanger at the end. Just perfect.\n\n--------------------------------- SPOILER  END ---------------------------------\n\nAll in all, it saddens me that a game with such a brilliant beginning (again, one of the best written and executed I've ever seen) gradually devolved into an uninspired succession of puzzles and action sequences, some even completely outside the context of the story. Even so, I recommend everyone to play this game, even if it's just for the parts where the plot comes back with new evolution for our main character and the inhabitants of the world he's exploring. Oh, and for the fantastic, submersive and delightful soundtrack, arguably the best character of the game.","May 25","true","10.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I backed this game, but later forgot about it, so when I started playing I had absolutely no recollection of the plot, what little I might have known. That was a good thing: this game has probably the BEST beginning half-hour I've seen since the first half of Wall-E. No words, no dialogue, just the acts and thoughts of the main character, and they tell you everything that you need to know in order to empathise with him. This feeling of discovery actually lasts for quite a while, since even after getting to the alien planet I was amazed by everything that I came into contact with, like a genuine explorer of a new world... that is, until I left the first part of the game, which I call "Story World", and I arrived at "Puzzle World".\n\n--------------------------------- SPOILER ALERT --------------------------------\n\nFrom this moment on, the plot just sits patiently in a corner until you're done with the puzzles, then tells you a little bit of how the story goes on, then sits again to let you jump, climb, teleport and move green pieces all around. This is when the game started to lose me, but I pressed on, mainly because the story was interesting, but also because the puzzles were, at times, really damn ingenious. There are some here and there where I just had to roll my eyes in disbelief (Sliding puzzles? Really?), but they were really interesting to crack for the most part.\n\nThen we arrive at the third part of the game, "Action World", where high precision jumps are the norm and hundreds of deaths are the punishment for failure. This is where the writers' inspiration seems to have run out: the last thing I expected to see in a heavily dramatic, plot-driven game such as this one is a stage where you have to fight the Purple Tentacle from Maniac Mansion and the zombie pirate LeChuck. Yes, I know, "it's an hommage", right? Well, for me, an hommage is a picture in the background, a statue on the floor, or a few notes of a recognisable tune, not modelling an action level of your dramatic game with characters from other games, brilliant and influential as they might be. And having a bullet hell stage as the final boss, in a game with a plot that doesn't really need any kind of "final boss", is just lazy writing to me.\n\nFinally, at the end of the story it is revealed that the "immortality solution" which the main character has been searching all his life is just storing a person's mind in a computer, something which I'm pretty sure that his own society already had the ability to do. I mean, they have perfected interstellar travel and full-body stasis chambers, yet they can't make a copy of the neuronal network of a person? It just doesn't make sense. And the ending? A few still images transitioning from one to another. That's it. No emotion at all. Oh, and the worst part: a cliffhanger at the end. Just perfect.\n\n--------------------------------- SPOILER  END ---------------------------------\n\nAll in all, it saddens me that a game with such a brilliant beginning (again, one of the best written and executed I've ever seen) gradually devolved into an uninspired succession of puzzles and action sequences, some even completely outside the context of the story. Even so, I recommend everyone to play this game, even if it's just for the parts where the plot comes back with new evolution for our main character and the inhabitants of the world he's exploring. Oh, and for the fantastic, submersive and delightful soundtrack, arguably the best character of the game.","May 25","true","10.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/templeth/recommended/311010/","templeth","Freeway Licker","http://steamcommunity.com/id/templeth/","125 products in account","I backed this on Kickstarter as it is heavily inspired by Another World and Flashback. It's rather good to say the least and does well to preserve the atmosphere of its inspiration. However the tedium of the game can deter a good play session. I clocked this on a day off and at times it felt like a chore to play. I was hoping that the save and combat mechanics would pay homage to the likes of Blackthorn and Flashback yet it seems less complex and extra clunky at times.\n\nOften the puzzles seem removed from the environment and the narrative. With the tedious design it takes perseverence to get through. Not alike Another World or Flashback.\n\nEnjoyable game in the end. And I would recommend it. Not as great level design as Flashback or Another World yet even so, a great nod in a nostalgic direction and a beautiful production. I am a fan. And I would love to see the production team come up with another project in the same vein.","May 27","true","22.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Still worth it IMO.\n\nThis game delivered everything that I hoped it would: A retro nostalgia, a moving story line, with some humour and pop culture references on the side.\n\nThe game took me 9.7hours to finish. Many of the puzzels were just at the right level of difficulty, though some were so difficult I had to look up what the puzzle *was* before I could even attempt a solution.\n\nSome complained about the two game squences that were not at all platformers, and whilst these sequences were a bit crap, they were not hard, and didn't get in the way of my enjoyment of the game.\n\nI may replay this just for the achievements, though given that most of the fun is in the story line, and in solving the puzzles, I'm not sure how fun this is going to be.","May 28","true","10.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/veraxus/recommended/311010/","veraxus","Veraxus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/veraxus/","418 products in account","The Way wears it's Another World inspiration on it's sleeve, but it draws heavily from a dozen "dead" classic genres. At times it bears a striking resemblance to LucasArts classic adventures, while at others it skews heavily toward Prince of Persia (the original, not the 3D remake).\n\nThe story is OUTSTANDING. Rich, emotional, well-told... as an adventure game, it's up there with the greats; and the fantastic quality of the art and music really help drive it home.\n\nWhere The Way stumbles however, is in it's sudden precipitous difficulty spikes and unexpected changes in gameplay type. For example, the first act of the game is largely adventure-oriented, almost like a spiritual successor to Sword & Sworcery EP... then suddenly you are thrust into a Prince of Persia/Another World-style running and leaping chase sequence.\n\nCompounding the frustration is the awkward mouse-based aiming mechanic. Instead of using a "radial" aim, you have full mouse movement and your character will shoot at the cursor. This becomes a problem in later stages as your cursor is bound to the window even as your character moves on screen, which unexpectedly changes your line of sight.\n\nThere's even a rock-dodging racing segment reminiscent of Full Throttle... unfortunately it's marred by a substandard implementation: although there are 3 "lanes", the game doesn't lock you to those lanes, leading to your character doing a LOT of unexpected crashing as you just don't have the precision needed to clear the rocks on a pixel-precise basis.\n\nThe final stages are especially infuriating, as the game suddenly introduces bullet-hell gameplay on top the Prince of Persia platforming that also requires precision shooting with the aforementioned awkward mouse controls. Unfortunately, this also means you almost certainly won't be able to pass the late game using a Steam Controller... and a standard gamepad is out of the question.\n\nThese are problems that could be easily fixed with some relatively minor tweaks. If the developers evened out the difficulty and polished up some of the controls/mechanics, The Way could be a classic for the ages. As it stands, it's rough around the edges, and it's occassionally an equally rough play... but even so, the puzzles are smart, the story is wonderful, and the art, music, and hidden sci-fi and gaming references make this a title I still recommend.\n\nJust go in knowing what you're in for, and accept that you're going to encounter some really punishing rough patches. If you can get past those, The Way is a very rewarding, satisfying game.","June 3","true","14.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
