Pretty good for a £7 early access game.\n\nPROS:\n- Insane ship customisation, seems like 100+ parts (and this is only the first public release) some of which are decorative, utility, or weapons. You can have things like a sickbay, crew quarters, various armours, different cannons and propellors on a tiny or huge ship. Or you can glue a giant ♥♥♥♥ banner on the side of it.\n\n- Pretty intense, epic combat. My eyes hurt from watching various cannon balls and shrapnel fly around everywhere, ships falling out of the sky and exploding on the ground, swashbuckling crewmates boarding enemy ships via flimsy ropes and watching your little guys run around inside your ships fixing things and dying. Amazing.\n\nCONS:\n- Although you build little defensive structures around your cities, they are basically just the same as ships except they can't move. No advantage really to investing in these, might as well build more ships.\n\n- Battles seem to last about 45 seconds, even the largest ships run out of ammo very quickly and its annoying how often ships will just seemingly explode after taking one hit.\n\n- Very limited single player campaign at the moment, just about 6 or 7 cities on a map which can be easily taken by 2 or 3 ships. I pretty much beat it in 10 mins.\n\n- Picking certain things for your custom banner will actually determine which perks you get, meaning that you have to pick the icons for what perks you want, meaning you cant actually make the banner you want because you wont get the best perks. Don't really see a reason for this, just make the perks a seperate thing.\n\nOVERALL , this game is really fun so far, the cons are things that seem like easy fixes to me (just rebalance ammo and add more defense structure parts) if you like games like Pixel Pirates or SPAZ, this game is for you. The simple pixel graphics might not be for everyone but if you can get past that this game has some potential.\n\n","February 25, 2015","true","0.7"," 34 of 37 people (92%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","92","34","37","3","0"

Flying Forts? Beutiful Ships that look lovely while on fire? Bombers that can't get more than 20 meters off the ground? You see it, you build it, you realise it doesn't work and you improve. Great for replayability and Fun!\n\n-All ships and Building have weaknesses. Built an amazing flying fort that's basically immune to all weapons and can keep flying basically forever? Lol you just got rammed by a fireship and are now buring falling out of the sky.\n\n-Campaign map is pretty easy to work, could do with some more work but it's simple and it works nicely.\n\n- Can build individual ships and refit old ones to adapt to new enemy ships and buildings. This would be further made better if the AI was better and the enemy ship veriaty was improved.\n\n-Varied Combat\n\nCons/Would be cool:\n-Sometimes Crashes but that doesn't become a problem if you safe often. AutoSave Feature would be great!\n\n-Campaign Map could be a bit more complex and a few more features regarding economy,defence and happiness could be added.\n\n-Experience for Ship Crew would be 10/10, would stop me just scrapping amazing ships that have been to hell and back that i've become attached to.\n\n- "Technologies" could be researched/ stolen/ reverse engineered from captured vessels.\n\n-More Diffuculty in taking over cities and more diversity in types of cities you're taking over. E.g a captitol cities or larger cities  could be bessieged/ bombed to reduce the defences of that city. This would make taking this more of an achievement.\n\n-War would cost rescources not just money. Not enough steel for ship aromour? Gotta use wood. Your faction is having a coal Shortage due to your vast fleets? Your fleet is now grounded and unable to move far.\n\nOveral a really good game with amazing potential, I can't wait to see where it goes!\n9/10","July 4, 2015","true","15.4"," 31 of 33 people (94%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","94","31","33","2","0"

For anyone interested in sandbox airship/tank/fortress building, and then using them in battle, this is a no-brainer. I mean the real bonus is that there is a gameplay mode to suite everyone.

Click on a city and you are presented with side-on view of the city surrounds and any buildings, airships and landships located there.\n\nLevel 3:\nEach vehicle has a distinctive, often animal like, shape and can have 'scary' looking warpaint.  The shape of the vehicle is a direct result of what it actually needs to successfully move and operate.  Nothing you see is pointless.\n\nLevel 4:\nNow, zoom in to one of the vehicles and notice the individual rooms, with corridors and ladders connecting them.  It's like a little city within each vehicle.\n\nLevel 5:\nPick one of the rooms and zoom in further and you can see tiny men actually operating the weapons, transferring coal/ammo from stores, putting out fires, reparing armour, resting in berths, using repair rooms, controlling the vehicle etc.\n\nNow realise each of these men is essential to the operation of the vehicle but can be killed in battle. Amazing!\n\n\nPros:\n\n* Such an original game, there is nothing else like it.\n\n*  Great feeling of controlling an empire of hundreds of fantasy war machines and thousands of poor little men needed to operate them.\n\n*  Nice flexibiliy to play battles as a fast action game or a slower tactical game thanks to the time controls and spacebar to pause.\n\n* Excellent feedback on what is actually happening during a battle thanks to 'speech bubbles' from your men when the vehicle takes damage, fires break out,  crew-members die, the battle is lost/won etc.\n\n* If you don't like the built-in vehicle designs, design your own using the in-game designer and see if you can do any better.  You can also design and build static buildings (ie fortresses) and these are essential for defending a city.\n\n* Really unique and stylish presentation style for an indie game.  The typeface, colour scheme, campaign map graphical design and UI style are all very well done.\n\n* Music soundtrack is stirring and suits the theme of the game perfectly.\n\nCons:\n\n*  Still in EA/alpha so there are a few performance issues with large battles, but the developer is aware of these and is looking to fix them asap.\n\n* There are not many players playing multiplayer games at present.  I play single player only and love it, but if you need multiplayer you may want to wait to see if the community really grows.\n\n* Some minor UI issues but these might just be my own preferences.\n\n\nIn summary, highly recommended.","December 7, 2015","true","20.9"," 18 of 19 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","18","19","0","0"

There is a lot of stuff to build with and designing huge ships is fun.  This game reminds me of games from the mid-90s with its art-style.  It kinda reminds me of Sid Meier's Sword of the Samurai but the gameplay is completely different, it's mainly just the overworld map that reminds me of that game, and when it does, it makes me wonder why this game wasn't made 20 years ago.  It could've been done 20 years ago but the answer is quite simple.  It's because video game developers lack vision.

The game shines in its mechanics and depth of detail (each crew member and is modeled with his/her own duties, ship systems such as coal, ammo and water run in real time, if you lose a significant portion of your crew certain systems will be resource starved).\n\nThe particle effects are amazing and it's so satisfying taking in the battle damage endured by your airship/vehicle in a smoke filled sky above the burning remains of your enemy.\n\nInitally from youtube videos I was under the impression it was a turn-based game but this is not the case. It is very much real time. The cool down timer for giving commands to your ship (longer the bigger your ship is, can be shortened by adding bridge/cockpit modules) adds an extra dimension to battles where planning and preemptive positioning are rewarded.\n\nThe game has its rough edges but is supported by an active developer with plans for new features in the future such as adding monsters and random encounters in conquest among other things.\n\nConclusion: Great game with an enjoyable multiplayer.

Designing your own Airships is a really fun experience, and seeing how well your ideas match up in real battles makes this game, at least for me, a very addictive experience. I’m still pretty bad at actual combat, but I’ve enjoyed trying to “out design” the enemy. I’ve always wanted to know what an RTS would be like if *I* could design the units, and with Airships, I get the answer.\n\nIts worth mentioning that this is an Early Access game. I’ve scored a few of these games, and while I’ve seen a lot of customers who are really happy with Early Access, I know some people prefer to wait. With the pace that David Stark (the main dev) is updating Airships, I think we all see a promising future, but if you are looking for the final, complete Airships experience, you might want to wait. Having said that, the Airships that I’ve played on Steam is quite different from the Airships that I played when David Stark and I first talked about the score— this guy is serious about keeping the game updated, and working toward a solid, finished product. For me, Airships: Conquer the Skies is already worth a try, and I’ve had a fun time playing it, especially in its Early Access state.\n\nI’m really proud to have been able to work on this title, and I’m excited to see it here on Steam. If it seems like something you’d be into, the price simply can’t be beat.\n\n…I also hear the score is really good too :)\n\n10/10 would write a score for this again.","April 3, 2015","true","2.8"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","92","12","13","4","0"

I'm writing this simply because the devs asked nicely to help them out, and seeing as how I've lost my entire night and morning playing this game, I'm obliging.  I've barely tapped the surface here, but I could spend hours and and hours designing and testing ships.  I've spent 5 hours so far on my first design.  Haven't even touched land vehicles.  I did make a huge land base building that was pretty sweet.\n\nThe different types of strategies for ships are mind-boggling.  You can create ships that have a high vertical ceiling that can then drop bombs on your enemy, or you can create a fast ship for ramming your enemy, or you could just try to get close and board the enemy.\n\nAnd the multiplayer works flawlessly.  For a game that doesn't look all that awe-inspiring on the Steam Store, I'm amazed at how well everything just works.  You create a game, set a point limit, and can either choose to use a single giant flying vehicle, or a squadron of little ones, or a mix of land, air, and static buildings.  Just everything about this is so well-designed and works so flawlessly.  I'd write more, but I want to get back to editing my ship and challenging my friend to a re-match!","March 15","true","11.6"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

I am glad I did. The premise of the game is to construct airships, landships and structures in varying degrees of complexity. The sheer amount of designs you can build is amazing. Hundreds of different parts that perform a specific funtion are available. A bridge to command your ship, coal rooms to provide fuel, ammo storage to distibute ammo, the list goes on an on. There are tons of weapons, armors and other combat enhancements as well. And all of this before you even engage in real time fights with your creations. Issue orders to gain the advantage. Rain hell from above with a 20 cannon compliment airship. Use a boarding ship to board and take over other vessels. The tactical situations are endless. The 2-D graphics are amazing and very much compliment the desiging and action. Watch little crew members run around the ship performing different functions as you battle. Fires break out commonly and will slow the action on whichever part of the ship is on fire. It almost feels very much like FTL in that regard. If only in FTL, it was all realtime. In my time with the game, I havent found one thing wrong with it. For an early access title, it truly is in a class of its own. Pay the 9.99 and thank the dev for the pleasue.","May 7","true","2.4"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

Review after around 4 hours gameplay, and expecting to get a lot more out of it even at this stage.\n\nPros:\n\n- Endless customisation! There are a lot, and I mean a *lot*, of viable combinations in airship design. Cannons! Flamethrowers! Bombs! Ramming! Boarding! Or a combination of them all. And of course there's the choice of a swarm of smaller ships vs several big behemoths, or, my current favourite, a group of cruiser-size ships with cannons and boarding that can support each other and go on if one dies.\n\n- Decent AI. I'm finding the AI can use each different ship very well, with very few glitches for an early-access game. It's especially good at ramming, there's a good variety of AI ships in campaign mode, and I'm finding so far that each engagement still has the thrill of the unexpected. Although it's obviously a simpler game, I'm finding it refreshing after games like Rome: Total War 2 where the AI doesn't vary its units and is extremely easy to counter.\n\n- A solidly functional campaign mode that should provide a decent few hours of fun.\n\n- Online battles! Set a price limit, whether single ship only or fleet, and battle your friends.\n\n- Pretty! For a pixel game it's really nice to look at and clearly a lot of love has gone into the campaign mode backgrounds as well as the ship combat.\n\nCons:\n\n- Interface is still a bit fiddly. As far as I can see it's improved a lot over the last few updates, but it would be good to have something like a circle indicating how far boarders can grapple, better idea of what your boarders and guards are doing, and an empire balance sheet in campaign to find out where all your money is going. It has vastly improved recently in listing coal stocks, ammo stocks and so on, and the developer is paying a lot of attention to feedback so I'd expect the interface to continue to improve.\n\n- Hard to find multiplayer games at this early stage. I can see it has huge potential for tournaments and leagues, though.\n\nHonestly, trying to find any other cons seems like nit-picking at this stage. Airships: Conquer the Skies is enormous, evocative fun and, having been ground down by overpriced games like Civ 5 and Total War DLC, endless Dwarf Fortress clones and rude, terrible World of Tanks team-mates, this gem has made me feel really enthusiastic about gaming again.\n\nHighly recommended.","May 21, 2015","true","6.5"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

Rifle it up! If you want some more uumpf then cannons and bomb bay doors will do the trick.\nOr if you are a brute you can just ram you're ship against the other ones.\n\nOf course you can't build a ship with a ton of guns and ammo and expect it to fly very well without a bunch of lift and propulsion modules which you have to take into consideration while building them.\nCrew is also important for everything from getting the ammo to the guns and operating them, or controlling fires and helping wounded comrades to the sickbay if needed.\n\nThe other limiting factor of you're imagination is naturally the cost of the airships and the bank vault of you're empire.\nIf you want bigger ships, then you must invade the other nations of the world and destroy the defensive buildings and airships stationed there. Which in turn makes the empire bigger and more cash come in from the newly acquired cities.\n\nBe careful though! If you take your fleet into the enemy city and you yourself haven't produced any defensive buildings for the protection of you're citizens, the enemy can and will take you're city.\nThis way the game also has small strategical elements to it.\n\nThere is also a multiplayer mode but I haven't been able to try that as of yet, but I can imagine people coming up with all kinds of amazing airships to destroy one another.\n\nGraphics are cute but at times its hard to make sense on what's going on because of them.\n\nThis is still in early access so if you absolutely don't purchase these things then don't but this game is in my opinion a diamond compared to other stuff that early access has given us.\n\n\nSo I absolutely do recommend this game even in it's incomplete form.","February 25, 2015","true","1.4"," 14 of 23 people (61%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","61","14","23","8","0"

There is a very comfortable editor in game and rules and limitations are simple and balanced.

Sadly, there is no modding support for now, but the updates bring new stuff, so it's ok.\n\nFun!\nAmong other stuff, you may see: big battles, small battles, a ship you were building for an hour is falling apart because you pressed a wrong button, small cute men run around your ship, small cute men killing each other on your/enemy's ship, small cute men jump from one ship to another accidently falling (wich is even more fun), small cute men dying in agony all around your ship/fortress, firethrowers (yes, baby), meet cool men in glorious battles high in the sky, crash two (or more) big airships into each other, annoy the dev about updates and new features (and if this you can do anywhere, ...), see those updates and new features! The list could go on, but...\n\nI'm tired of writing this!\nSo I'll just say try it!

A small cutter, assualt ship, or land ship to deliver marines to enemy ships and structures and take them for yourself? Or maybe a massive flying castle wich mainly sits in one spot and blows everything apart. Then, build it. Seriously, its that simple. You can even sit there and paint it up to look nice too if you want.\nAstheticly, this game is pleaseing. You get the steampunk vibe right away, when your first makeing your coat of arms. As  the combat takes off you realize you didnt give your airship enough lift, or that your landship cant take a hill to save it's life. So you take that design and refurbish it, and try again. Now you realize airships are tearing your landships apart, so you start to tack AA guns on every single build.\nMeanwhile dureing the fighting, one of your cannons hits thiere coal store, and they catch fire. Unable to fuel vital systems they crash and explode spectacularly.\n2D and pixilated, yes, but it works for this game.  I avoid this game now dureing the work week, because I know how addictive it is, and how much time will vanish before I shut it down.\nKeep up the goood work devs, cant wait to see more.","September 7, 2015","true","30.6"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Its that I enjoy building something and then watching it blow up.\nWhile Airships at first seems daunting with the amount of pieces and customization offered. Becomes easier as you begin to learn the ropes, and what is required to make one of your ships float. Suddenly you find yourself making massive vessels that would make the Highwind blush.\nWith a focus on strategy and action, the conquest mode is enjoyable and fun. However I find bases to be slightly under powered and needs some sort of a boost.\nThe true fun lies in its creation and combat mode. Where you can set up huge battles with unlimited resources. Watch as your titanic ships battle to the bitter end. The game does have a few hiccups though.\nA tutorial would've been nice. It takes an hour to learn how to play. Steam workshop support would be amazing and more control over the level design would be awesome as well.\nIn all Airships is a fun game and has a overwhelming amounts of customization for your Airships.

I have not played the multiplayer very much, but the single player is some of the most fun to be had with 10$ that you'll ever find!\n\nThe graphics are neat pixel art, and available in a wide range of resolutions. Very crisp, though sometimes the colors can be a little bland (menus and such tend to be all brown or black, which is to be expected of the genre yes, but perhaps a little higher contrast would make things easier to see).\n\nGameplay is extremely solid. I've only encountered extremely mild bugs (a certain airship design never replaced the cannon when repaired, I had to refit it with one every time). You use the mouse to select commands for the airships (usually just movement) and this can seem simplistic at first, but quickly gets hectic once you start having more than 6 ships in a battle at the same time, which is by no means a bad thing! (protip: try to manuever your ships so that when one goes down, it doesnt take 3 others directly below with it, causing a massive fiery explosion destroying half your fleet).\n\nsound deisign is spot on, weapons have varying sound effects that allow you to tell what is being fired by listening alone, music is good, though there's only like 3 different songs in the whole game. You don't really notice this though, as i'd liken it to the hangar building music in Kerbal Space Program; just sort of there, not really in the forground.\n\nSome changes i'd love to see would be a custom sizing option for the menus, with the building menu sometimes it's difficult to select which module you want (at least on my 1080p screen, not sure about smaller resolutions). It would also be wonderful to see some more offline modes, perhaps having only a single airship and upgrading in order to complete tasks or something.\nAnd finally, I would love to be able to personally change which workers do what, or at least assign them myself. for example, if I have 6 airshipmen, an ammo depot (4 workers max), two cannons (1 worker each) and a water tank (2 workers max), the game will automatically decide where the workers go. so i might have 2 workers on the water tank, two for the cannons, and two for the ammo depot. But sometimes i'd rather have 3 on the depot, and only 1 on the water tank. nitpicky perhaps, but it would help a little.\n\noverall fantastic game, extremely enjoyable. Nothing glaringly wrong. Definitely a positive mark on the tarnished steampunk genre of games.","February 8","true","3.8"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Don't be surprised if soon your boarders are met with a hail of gunfire from their marines. The possibilities are endless. Will you overwhelm their defences with massive battleships or walking fortesses, or will you swarm them with small craft? Or a mixture of both to keep them guessing? ~25 hours in and so far, I see no guarantee of victory in any design, weapon, or tactic.

Arishps: Conquer The Skies combines a good strategy game with all the fun of building your own kind of fleet.  Even it is an early access game is already good for playing and makes a lot of fun. I can't wait to see the finished game and all of its new coming features.\n\nAbout the game itself. You are playing a nation starting with a small city on the map. You can choose between different map sizes (small, medium, large) and you mainly control your fleet over this map. Then you can start bulding a Airship in the city and construct one by yourself. A plus point here is that you actually don't need a tutorial because there are a lot of helpful information within the game and game itsel is good to handle.\n\nIf you want to built your own Airship you need a lot of different modules so that your ship can acutally fly or shoot...Moreover think about the money. A complex high armored Battleship is nice but it is actually even better when you have the money to bulit it ^^..So you always have to think about to balance between Airships, Money and Defense. So actually you can very, rebuilt, refit your ships or defense structure which is really nice and brings a lot of varity in the game.\n\nWhat more is there so say......\n\nAirships: Conquer the Skies is one of the few really good Early Access games. So far it is working fine and makes a lot fun. I can't find any serious bugs or problems within the game. For everybody who always has dreamt about building his own nation with a fleet of own constructed Airships and crush them against your enemies this game is a must have.","February 25, 2015","true","14.1"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","7","11","0","0"

Any strategy can be countered but it goes way beyond the old rock-paper-scissors thing. You can utilize high altitude bombers or counter this with a bunch of flak guns. You can build a high speed ramming ship, close-range flamethrower walker, or Marine boarding tank. Some players like to build a bunch of cheap spam walkers and rifle ships or (like me) concentrate funds into ginormous juggernauts. In Airships your imagination is the limit.

I know, that is hard to believe, but hear me out. I was sceptical at first, but then I started playing it. Airships has as much depth as From the Depths, but is simple enough to learn in a few minutes. Here are my pros and cons. Remember, this game is very much in an alpha state.\n\nPros:\n- Easy to learn\n- Runs well\n- Satisfying combat which never gets boring.\n- Despite the pixelated visuals, it looks amazing. Not just due to its lighting and textures (which are good, but not outstanding), but its detail. If you zoom in on your ship, you can see crewman rushing around the ship, making repair, carrying shells to load into cannons, shoveling coal, and aiming and firing the guns. It is really amazing.\n- Easy to use editor\n- Sandbox for testing your creations\n- Fun and simple overworld in conquest mode\n\nCons:\n- Crashes frequently\n- AI can sometimes be ridiculously overwhelming in conquest mode.\n- Conquest has no diplomacy. You always are at war with everyone, no matter what. It could be great if you could establish alliances and trade. The conquest mode is also too short. If the pace was slower, it would help the game greatly. In conquest mode, it seems as if the only way to win is to buy as many cheap ships as you can, and then blitzkreig all your enemies. It takes away from the grand strategy portion.\n- Game will not work without internet\nConclusion: Despite a few balance issues and crashes, it is definitely worth the buy. It is updated frequently, and I can't wait to see what David Stark has in store for us.","May 15","true","34.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

For example, if you have a cockpit for a giant ship, you might only be able to issue commands every 30 seconds, but if you have a bunch of bridges for a small ship, you can issue commands very quickly.\n~Crew mechanics are interesting, your crew members can be wounded and then taken to a sickbay to recover. They also quite clearly move around the ship doing various tasks, such as feed coal into the engines, running engines, aiming guns, reloading guns, commanding the ship (from the bridge or cockpit), repairing the ship, defending the ship from invaders, and many more things (too many to list).\n~A campaign thing that is a bit simple at the moment, although the dev is working on making it more interesting.\n~Ship customization\n~Realistic Heraldry, which affects your ships though some bonuses depending on what you choose.\nThese are just a few of the many good points of this game.

Tactics and placement feel as important as the designs themselves.

You make an airship and your ship fights other ships in an attempt to take over the world.  However it is very complex and making a ship is very fun, since you have complete controll over building one.  Also it has a ton of customization when making your nation's flag, where you can choose colors and the designs.  But what really made me like this game is the fact that the developer is constantly adding new things.  I am still extrememly suprised that when I suggested on the forums that it would be cool if we could make uniforms for our airsailors the actual developer said that now he is going to put that into some upcoming update.  Honestly I have never seen a developer that would look through the forums and take suggestions just from random players, as I saw that he responded to practically everyone who had a problem.

You can fight with pre-made airships and bases or build your own with the editor. I would say it could benefit from a tutorial mode or easy mode, but maybe I'm just not very good at it at the moment!\n\nI like the pixel graphics and the 1920s feel to it. I also really like watching all your sailors go running around and how they say things.\n\nIn short, lots of strategy, good retro look, and pretty difficult.\n\n","May 18, 2015","true","1.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The wide choice of modules makes designing an airship an interesting challenge, and mine can go through several revisions before it's time to get overly emotionally involved in the plight of your poor air sailors, who run back and forth through the ship trying to stem the damage being wreaked on them by the other side's grenadiers, rockets, cannons and marines, until eventually one ship or another explodes and carves a chunk out of the landscape. The map-conquering single-player game has lots of details and strategy to keep you occupied, and I haven't beaten it yet, but I have to be honest, for me this game is all about designing beautiful machines and blowing them up.","May 18, 2015","true","1.3"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

I have to say this game has come very far in that year and I commend the developer for constantly updating the game. The gameplay has come along nicely, and it's easy to spend a ton of time developing new ships and seeing how they interact in combat. I agree with some of the other posters, that ammunition seems to deplete a bit too quickly, but otherwise the combat feels very balanced.\n\nFor $10 this game is an incredible bargain. It's graphics may not be the most amazing but I actually really love the pixelated soldeirs running about putting out fires. I think it adds a nice element.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/AdmiralObvious/recommended/342560/","AdmiralObvious","Admiral Obvious","http://steamcommunity.com/id/AdmiralObvious/","126 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThis is a pretty fun games as it currently stands (as of version Alpha 8.14).\n\nThe game is as it says on the tin, design air (or land) ships in a steam punk environment, and send them against your enemies.\n\nThe design of these ships is also quite sensible, since there are lose conditions that may hit you at any point during battle for each one of your ships, which you can mitigate based on how you assembled your vehicle.\nBuild your ship poorly, with only one access corridor to the water supply, and you're going to have a bad time. Especially once the coal store ignites.\nRun out of coal for your "suspendium" engine that keeps your airship afloat, and you will fall out of the sky.\nRun out of ammo, and, welp, all those giant cannons you have there might work as a battering ram if you're lucky.\nDon't have any water on board? Have fun watching the ammo store turn into a fireworks show when it inevitably catches fire!\nDon't have any guards on board? Have fun letting your enemies capture the ship and turn it against you.\n\nThere are very many pieces of a ship you can use to assemble essentially whatever you can think of, provided you stay within a few specified constraints, which you can change, depending on what you can afford. Most of these restraints from what I've dealt with had to do with overloading my vessels by adding too much gun, or by trying to armor my entire tank with bricks (harder to break completely compared to metal which doesn't like to explode).\n\nAt the moment there are 2 gamemodes.\n\n1. Combat mode, which is as you would guess. Throws you onto a blank map, where you deploy your own, and you enemies ships, duke it out and see what happens. This mode is essentially the sandbox mode of the game, as there are no financial restrictions. This is also the only mode that is currently available in multiplayer.\n\n2. Campaign mode is a mode where the game generates a map for you and up to 12 other AI empires to face each other with reasonably good tactical battles and planning.\nAt the moment the campaign is a bit thread bare as the only language any empire speaks seems to be "shoot them in the face". This isn't exactly a bad thing, as the mode is quite entertaining, especially since the AI does seem to be quite competent with how it handles it's forces and resources.\nEach city captured will have different resources or tech you can exploit, like cheaper wood for example, reducing the cost of wood armored ships, and maybe a different city will have the technology of flamethrowers.\nUnfortunately at the moment there is no way to steal, research, or reverse engineer tech without taking the city which contains it, but this is a flaw which I can see being fixed reasonably soon probably, considering we are still in early(ish) alpha. I've completed my first victorious large campaign in just under an hour, granted most of that time was spent designing ships to counter my enemies.\n\nThe game itself is actually very pretty considering the pixel art graphics, and can run on essentially a toaster oven.\n\nI feel the current price of 9.99 is actually quite a reasonable price for the game with the current ammount of features present in the game, as this game is quite the time sink if you want it to be (I've probably got about 6 or more hours in offline mode that steam doesn't track). I would happily reccomend this game to anyone that asks about it.","March 20","true","4.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

The only thing is that now that I've discovered how to win easily, it's become sort of simple. Build lots of barracks, and steal everything from everyone. If you target cities with ships in their area, you can build a massive fleet made of stolen airships and take on anything. I took on a fleet twice mine in both ship size and number, and came out on top just from stealing most of their ships. It's hard to win otherwise, since it's impractical to build an awesome 1-ship behemoth flagship, though not impossible if you conquer enough territories. It's fun to be air pirates, though. It's rare, but the enemy will sometimes have 1 massive fleet that's tough to kill. I'm excited about the future of this game.

There are only 2 options you have against an opponent: send a spy or invade the city. Even the largest map on the hardest difficulty is easy to beat once you know how the AI works. The ship building and operating looks very complex on first sight but turns out to be of little or no concern since everything in the ship is automated and there is literally zero micro management needed to fight a battle. The ship building is the only redeeming quality of this game, it's cool to make your own ship but you have a limited size and the number of diferent modules feels quite limited. The battles are always extremely short even when you have competing opponents; most take about 30 seconds.

After the academy, the conquest is too difficult, design&fight is boring because you have to come up with the enemy yourself. Finally multiplayer is empty as not so many players are there. So, in the end, after finishing the academy it's very difficult to stay entertained.\n\nOne possible solution is to do the following. You start with a limited budget and you fight different enemies. Each win gives you more money, so that you can gradually upgrade the ship. If you lost, you don't lose anything - you should just redesign your ship. I believe having this mode is crucial for the game success.","May 23","false","1.6"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

More modules, bigger battles, longer campaigns, more detailed tech tree, etc.\n\nAt the end of the day, it's a early access indie title that only costs $10 USD, so you have to be a bit realistic about what is possible. In that mindset it has a lot going for it:\n\n1. I've not encountered any noticeable bugs\n2. It runs fine on a laptop not built for gaming\n3. Gameplay is fairly straightforward to learn and amenable to both casual and intense playstyles\n4. Game balance is reasonable with multiple viable strategies\n5. The developer is very approachable with plenty of interesting and attainable ideas for the future\n\nContent-wise (as of v7.4), you're looking at about 15 to 20 hours worth of gameplay value for a singleplayer-only experience if you have only a modest interest in ship design. If you happen to have a friend or two for regular multiplayer sessions or happen to really love designing things just to watch them explode, I can easily see that going upwards of 40 hours.\n\n------\n\nEven if you're not convinced this is for you, it is worth watching for future updates. The game seems to only get better with age.","December 11, 2015","true","86.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is still early alpha and the developer is clearly working hard on sorting out problems. I just wanted to quickly change this review to positive because I was a little unfair in the previous one. Once I have more time, I will go back and remove the misinformation.\n\nOld Review:\nI am running this game on Ubuntu, and it is basically unplayable. I don't know if other operating systems have these problems, but they make the game infuriating for me to play. Half of my airships refuse to move even though there is nothing around them they could collide with. The game also locks up randomly at times, and when I alt-tab my entire os is unresponsive. Another issue, unrelated to bugs, is that the computer seems to win stalemeates. If I run out of ammo during a fight in conquest mode and the computer does as well, it is content to sit there until I flee. I think the captain on defense should at win in these cases and not allow the ai to have free wins. If these problems are fixed, the game seems very enjoyable, but in its current state I cannot recommend it.","October 25, 2015","true","3.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","4"

This is not in of its self a critisim. the game is retivly fast paced. You can make a ship and fight it in about 10 mins, as oposed to from the depths where making a ship from consept to creation could be one wonderfull hour of planning and reworking.\n\nYou make airships and tanks and have them fight other airhsips and tanks. Combat is funn, and there is a lot of satisfaction is seeing your creations crush all that stand before them. Yet, at times this game can feel a bit on the shalow side. As of this moment, there are not a whole lot of parts in the game, so a lot of ships tend to folow the same trend. As this game is early acsess it is likily that more depth will be added if this game does well.

However, it is already a very playable game that, although somewhat Spartan (See: Starkly functional, not kicking people into pits) in it's presentation don't let that fool you.  There is quite a bit going on under the hood.\n\nThe theme reminds me of World War I scaling combined with H.G. Wells-like steampunk and fanciful technology with just a little sprinkling of fantasy in there.  The world is locked in bleak war with giant airships and landships at the front of the battle.  Rather than helium, your airships are held aloft with "suspendium", either as a dust in balloons or as a sort of engine housed in the ship's interior.\n\nShip design is an interesting balance between weight, lift, propulsion, durability, crew requirements, and cost.  Sure, you could sacrifice some armor to drop some weight and add an extra weapon, but you risk going up like a matchstick if you do.  Or perhaps you want to build a secondary suspendium chamber for extra lift and redundancy in case the other one is taken out?  Good idea, but remember that you need coal to power the various functions of your ship, which means more modules, more weight, more cost.\n\nYou also can design "land ships" which is pretty much the same as designing an airship sans lift components.  Instead you have a selection of mech-like legs and tank-like tracks to choose from.  They don't have the advantage of flight, but this also means weight isn't quite as much of a concern and they can make great, heavily-armored, mobile anti-air platforms as a result.\n\nLastly, you can also design non-mobile buildings as the centerpieces of defense in your territories.  You can really stack on the armor and weaponry there.  Just be sure you design the building to be resistant against fire, invasion, and attacks from multiple angles! Careful though, every module in this game has weight and physics and it's a huge disaster if parts of your structures begin to collapse on themselves!\n\nThere is a campaign to be played which is at the moment extremely simplistic but fun.  You send spies to neighboring states so that you can see their defenses.  Then you pay to sabotage them or build up your forces enough to overcome theirs and then invade.  As you control more territitories you gain more income, technology, and ship building ports.  Ships have upkeep costs to consider, and you need to budget your secret police (to prevent enemies from sabotaging you).  There isn't much to it other than that.\n\nThe game really expressly shines in the design and combat aspects.  The interface for design is a little bit cumbersome, but doesn't detract from the fun of snapping together modules on a grid.  There is also a bit of a personal touch there as you create unique shapes and decorate the ships with paint, banners, and decals.  You can then test your designs against the AI (or pit AI against AI) in the sandbox combat arena.\n\nThe combat itself can be pretty exciting despite how simple the game looks.  The way your crew operates reminds me a lot of FTL without the micromanagement.  That is to say that your little air sailors really do move around the ship and man the various stations, but you don't control them directly.  When you give the order to move, the crew runs to take coal from your coal stores and shovel them into the engine.  When you fire on a target, some sailors man the weapons while others haul up ammo.  Fires break out and sailors scramble to put them out with water, etc.  As you lose sailors in battle this diminishes your capabilty to run your ship efficiently, or can often leave you dead in the skies.\n\nCombat is impactful, with holes being punched through armor, and entire sections of your ships being blasted apart.  Fires break out and burn out of control.  Boarders scramble in through your windows using their tiny little grappling hooks.  Battering rams smash you to pieces.  It's all pretty intense and battles rarely play out the exact same way twice.  Sometimes a very lucky shot is all it takes to entirely turn the tide.  Other times what seems like a bad thing - like your ship falling out of the sky - might end up a good thing, like that falling ship absolutely squashing an enemy ship that was unlucky enough to be underneath it.\n\nThere is multiplayer here but in an extremely limited fashion (EG - no multiplayer campaigns), but that could possibly change down the road as this game is still under development.\n\nFire up the suspendium chamber if you...\n\nAre looking for a creative tactical combat game.\nLove building and iterating designs.\nAre a fan of all things steampunk and airship.\nAll hands abandon ship if you...\n\nReally want a lot of flashy visuals.\nPrefer a lot of micro-management or direct control.\nDesire deep multiplayer.\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThis game was a delightful surprise for an Early Access title.  It offers quite a bit of meat at the current stage of things, and is what I would call "fully playable".  I've already sunk many hours mostly just designing ships and combat scenarios alone.\n\nWith that said, there are some definite improvements that I'd love to see.  First in my mind are the landships.  Unless they are absurdly large, they are sort of ironically terrible at traveling on land.  This makes them far less generally useful than airships.\n\nAlso some aspects of design likewise seem entirely more useful than others.  Other than in cheap, small, suicide attacker airships, I found that using suspendium dust balloons is of pretty dubious use other than as a supplemental means of lift to suspendium chambers.  They are always targeted first by AI and are destroyed very easily.  So creating a giant Zeppelin-like craft or a Final Fantasy style airship isn't terribly feasible.\n\nIt'd be great to see traditional matchmaking for multiplayer as well as multiplayer campaigns someday as well.\n\nAll in all, though, it's all very solid and very fun.  If the screenshots/videos of the ship building appeal to you at all, then this is already a must for you.  Like mercilessly blasting apart your enemy with a 12 heavy cannon behemoth, you won't regret it.","March 28","true","55.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The other modes are a tutorial, a battle mode, and an online mode. The game will provide you will an excellent experince since there are many routes to go in, especally with the land units. It looks stunning not for how beautiful the grapics are, but for how well the partacles and explosions look. When a ship blows up, the screen will shake, and pieces will fly everywhere. Trust me it looks a lot better than it sounds. The ship builder is easy to use and it will provide information on what your missing such as if you need supplies or your surface ceiling is too low. For me it's a 9/10, however if you don't like fighting over the same territory a few times or mabye a lot of times depending on your difficulty and where it's located and who your fighting, and spending some to most of your time in the ship build then this is a 5 or a 6 for you, probably.","November 28, 2015","true","11.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game already is extreemly fun and has enough depth for you to get lost in it for hours without even thinging about it.\n\nThe basics of the game, weather you are building an airship, landship or defence tower all carry the same mechanic and the more you play the game the more time to want to spend perfecting your war machines.  Not only that but for a 2D sidescrolling game with tiny sprite people, its surrisingly action packed with great sounds, huge explotions and flashing lights that make you feel great when you bring enemys to their knees.\n\nNo idea what it planned for the full game, but at this point I dont think there it anything they could do wrong.","February 6","true","7.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The whole point of this game is to build a airship/tank/walker/spider walker/fortress and use it against your friends or any one else who dare challenge you not even to mention the single player which isn't some generic story of bad guys vs. good guys its a match against AI that aren't easy to get rid of . The AI flank you attack you were you are weakest and even fight over certain areas that provide advanced weaponry which you can attack yourself and gain the ability to use rockets or flamethrowers etc . The AI is amazing because certain AI empires use the same tactic against you and you can use that against them while others will learn new tactics as they defeat empires as well , a little tip when starting out is don't attack every empire possible because that will just mean they'll use their war effort against you .\n\n\nI loved and still Love this game , but I thought my love had ended when my hard drive on my computer died and I had to get a new one I thought all my ships were gone until I went on the game and found all my ships in Perfect condition .\n__\nI         I           /     I       /       \\nI         I          /      I       I        I\nI         I         /       I       I        I\nI         I        /        I       I        I\nI         I       /         I       I        I\nI         I      /          I       \___/    - Isn't that cool ?\n\n","January 22","true","52.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Plenty of replayability, experimentation, and strategies. The only issue I have is that the tutorial doesn't mention the Overlay function for airship, landship, and building design. This is SO essential to learning to build ships. I originally returned the game because everything I built was terrible because it couldn't get areas repaired or deal with fires so I thought the game was just unfair but when I saw the overlay function on a video I repurchased the game and realized my ships were absolute garbage. So I threw together a quick, decent ship and tried it. I won two battles I expected to lose with it, because I had my resources managed properly with the Overlay this time.\n\nIt's too easy to fail to realize that your crew has to walk over four blocks, then up two, then four over again to put out the fire because you assumed they'd only need to go up two blocks.

It plays EXACTLY like it looks, plus some more. It's fun to build your own airships piece by piece, however you want! Especially fun is the Conquest mode. You choose a difficulty(even easy is tough, but it helps you learn how to build and play better!), and a size of map, and you start with one city, allowing you to build air and land ships as you please(within your budget) and even build and place buildings and edit the terrain to defend your homeland. As you play, you conquest other cities and fight other NPC armies, until you have no city to call home or you have conquested the whole map! The multiplayer is a bit lacking, but only because there are very few(if any) online matches to join, because the game is in such early alpha.

It plays EXACTLY like it looks, plus some more. It's fun to build your own airships piece by piece, however you want! Especially fun is the Conquest mode. You choose a difficulty(even easy is tough, but it helps you learn how to build and play better!), and a size of map, and you start with one city, allowing you to build air and land ships as you please(within your budget) and even build and place buildings and edit the terrain to defend your homeland. As you play, you conquest other cities and fight other NPC armies, until you have no city to call home or you have conquested the whole map! The multiplayer is a bit lacking, but only because there are very few(if any) online matches to join, because the game is in such early alpha. It's totally worth 10 bucks, go ahead and buy it for essentially endless hours of fun.

Ship, landship and structure building is very straightforward and logical. Choices on the drawing board make a big difference strategically while in the battlefield. Still has lots of room to grow. Storywise there is nothing and the conquest mode feels quite empty although is playable. Greatest fun at this moment is building yourself new ships and testing them out while in conquest mode where you will be going against numerous types of enemies testing your designs resiliency. Capturing mechanics are quite OP right now. Making regular warmachines a bit obsolete when confronted with them.

This happens both when a ship is bisected and when it explodes into several large fragments.\n-Marines and commandos have unbelievably good pathing for an indie game. You can have several ships in  row in deadlock with enemy ships (where your ships are equals signs and enemy ships are minuses: ====-----) and tell the soldiers in your rearmost ship to board an enemy ship, and the men will exit their ship, get on its roof and walk or jump along all ships in the intermediate distance (friendly and enemy) if doing so allows them to reach their target. If an enemy ground installation has an island directly above it preventing close access, you can position yourself above the island and your men can jump from your ship onto the island, and then from the island onto the building. The island isn't a static movement zone, just a piece of terrain that's loosely classified as a ship. Incredible.\n-Ground walker mechs have highly adaptable footwork. I regularly see walker mechs climb on top of friendly and enemy landships in the course of movement, in fact this can be used to bridge otherwise impassible terrain. One time I saw a two-legged mech balance both feet atop a tree stump in the middle of combat.\n-Anything can be built from tiny mail blimps and little interceptors to kilometer-long battlecruisers super heavy dreadnoughts with hundreds of visible men aboard (these are legal in multiplayer while playing 10k-limit games, it should be noted) from the same component parts (of which there are many, many).\n\nAs you can see this is an incredibly deep, dynamic and potent game. Because it can be hard to tell whether somebody loves a game or just enjoys tinkering with it in their own particular way, here is a list of well-known and excellent games I've played recently but had less fun doing so than I did with Airships:\nPillars of Eternity\nL.A. Noire\nBroforce\nXCOM: Enemy Within\nPrison Architect\n\nI hope that Airships will become the low-key genesis of a famous AAA series to-be, similar to the relatively humble origins of Grand Theft Auto, Fallout, the Elder Scrolls and so forth. 10/10.","February 14","true","22.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Not only that but for a 2D sidescrolling game with tiny sprite people, its surrisingly action packed with great sounds, huge explotions and flashing lights that make you feel great when you bring enemys to their knees.\n\nNo idea what it planned for the full game, but at this point I dont think there it anything they could do wrong.","February 6","true","7.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

More modules, bigger battles, longer campaigns, more detailed tech tree, etc.\n\nAt the end of the day, it's a early access indie title that only costs $10 USD, so you have to be a bit realistic about what is possible. In that mindset it has a lot going for it:\n\n1. I've not encountered any noticeable bugs\n2. It runs fine on a laptop not built for gaming\n3. Gameplay is fairly straightforward to learn and amenable to both casual and intense playstyles\n4. Game balance is reasonable with multiple viable strategies\n5. The developer is very approachable with plenty of interesting and attainable ideas for the future\n\nContent-wise (as of v7.4), you're looking at about 15 to 20 hours worth of gameplay value for a singleplayer-only experience if you have only a modest interest in ship design. If you happen to have a friend or two for regular multiplayer sessions or happen to really love designing things just to watch them explode, I can easily see that going upwards of 40 hours.\n\n------\n\nEven if you're not convinced this is for you, it is worth watching for future updates.

More modules, bigger battles, longer campaigns, more detailed tech tree, etc.\n\nAt the end of the day, it's a early access indie title that only costs $10 USD, so you have to be a bit realistic about what is possible. In that mindset it has a lot going for it:\n\n1. I've not encountered any noticeable bugs\n2. It runs fine on a laptop not built for gaming\n3. Gameplay is fairly straightforward to learn and amenable to both casual and intense playstyles\n4. Game balance is reasonable with multiple viable strategies\n5. The developer is very approachable with plenty of interesting and attainable ideas for the future\n\nContent-wise (as of v7.4), you're looking at about 15 to 20 hours worth of gameplay value for a singleplayer-only experience if you have only a modest interest in ship design. If you happen to have a friend or two for regular multiplayer sessions or happen to really love designing things just to watch them explode, I can easily see that going upwards of 40 hours.\n\n------\n\nEven if you're not convinced this is for you, it is worth watching for future updates.

Creating different grades of craft for different situations prooves challeneging, as the conquest portion of the game, the enemy is always trying to one up you. It's an arms race to build the biggest guns first, but often creators need to think more than just about firepower. Budgets and requirements to keep a ship running shift the balance in the skies, and it is as much a puzzle game as an RTS when it comes to building.\n\nThis said, the game is still in Early Access, so there's a slight lack of content. The conquest mode doesn't last very long on any difficulty, and beyond these short campaigns, there is only the designer, non-campaign combat, and multiplayer. Additionally, it is worth noting that the campaign is very simplistic. Hopefully the creators will try to strive for additional content and game modes as the game becomes more popular. On the upside, this game is Workshop enabled, and people have already added a lot of fantastic content, so until there's more official stuff we have the brilliant work of modders to keep us busy.\n\n7.5/10","April 16","true","22.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Another game bought on sale thats kinda crappy.\nOne quiet afternoon, I got a wild hair up my ♥♥♥ and decided to wade through the tutorial. Woah, Dude...this game rocks! Every Dev who has decided to build a game needs to review Airships to understand what is missing from a CRAP LOAD of games today; i.e. PLAYABILITY. Games CAN be fun wiothout supedoopa graphics taxing your GPU.\nThat being said, would I have preferred non-pixelated graphics? Well, Yeah! But that is on me and my own feelings toward the retro trend of 8-bit style games. I got plenty of time with my Atari 2600 back in the day to suit me ...\nI am not going to replicate what others have said regarding how the game is played, however, if you enjoy War Games, Sim,ulations, Shooting, Management, and General Sandbox Building-type games, buy this title. You will not regret the purchase at double the asking price. Trust me, I've bought my share of egg-laying Steam games that have to be refunded or just lay dormant in my collection.\nLastly, I would like to thank anyone who had anything to do with bringing this game to market.","April 21","true","26.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I like the graphics they remind me of Terraria. The combat is realy well executed you can't directly choose where to fire but you have orders to fire at a specific ship move to somewhere and so on. And the devs are updating it often. Overall a very good game that I would recomend.","April 17","true","23.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","2"

Because there are basically no drawbacks to owning cities, factions will snowball in strength, and as soon as you control half the cities, you have already won.\n\nThe difficulty settings seem to mostly just change the strategy of the AI, which is exactly what they should do.\n\nAn easy mode campaign will allow you to conquer with a gustav cannon wunderweapon, while hard mode forces you to create super efficient designs.","April 26","true","19.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Creating different grades of craft for different situations prooves challeneging, as the conquest portion of the game, the enemy is always trying to one up you. It's an arms race to build the biggest guns first, but often creators need to think more than just about firepower. Budgets and requirements to keep a ship running shift the balance in the skies, and it is as much a puzzle game as an RTS when it comes to building.\n\nThis said, the game is still in Early Access, so there's a slight lack of content. The conquest mode doesn't last very long on any difficulty, and beyond these short campaigns, there is only the designer, non-campaign combat, and multiplayer. Additionally, it is worth noting that the campaign is very simplistic. Hopefully the creators will try to strive for additional content and game modes as the game becomes more popular. On the upside, this game is Workshop enabled, and people have already added a lot of fantastic content, so until there's more official stuff we have the brilliant work of modders to keep us busy.\n\n7.5/10","April 16","true","22.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
