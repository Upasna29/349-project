But in no way sufficient.\n\nThe technical aspect is clearly lackluster. The game doesn't have a fast forward, history or auto-read. I makes subsequent playthrough a bit annoying.\nAnd no, unity is not designed for a visual novel. I know that some things are easier to do with it than with a game engine like Ren'Py, but the constraint are quite annoying : 200MB of ram ? really ? 64b system only ? Visual novels are great being played on small factor devices. For these reason, this is not possible with this game.\n\nCharacters art are good. However, they could benefit from more movements and poses.\nSome special scenes (like the one in the shower room) could have dedicated graphics.\nSome art are a bit behind in term of quality, like the shopping scene or the beach one. This is acceptable on a first try. But only on a first try.\n\nCharacter development is... poor. Sorry, but that's something to work on.\n\nStory is short, so i know i should not expect a great scenario.\nAs for the writing. Please note that descriptions are not superfluous. It does not have to be only dialogue.\n\nThis is a good test (on the developper's perspective) for things that are related to a game, like monetisation and deployment.\n\nBut remember, experience is merely the name men gave to their mistakes.","January 5","false","2.4"," 203 of 235 people (86%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","86","203","235","5","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/medohgeuh/recommended/429580/","medohgeuh","Doomgal","http://steamcommunity.com/id/medohgeuh/","616 products in account","A mediocre visual novel in which a well-endowed Mary Sue gets to fall in love with the character of her dreams. Literally. Granted, I wasn't expecting a literary masterpiece (who was?); decent yuri fluff would have been more than enough to justify the price tag.\n\nBut let's be honest here: 'mediocre' gives A Wild Catgirl Appears! far more credit than it deserves. Even if you can somehow get over the middle school-grade writing skill and all its typographical errors, the game itself is flawed at a mechanical level to a baffling degree; the menu is out of an alpha stage demo, background quality is inconsistent, the CGs border on nightmare fuel, sprites aren't always scaled properly and the painfully stock music often fails to queue as intended.\n\nThen again, what do you expect from a VN made in Unity? No, I'm not kidding, it's actually built in Unity. Who the ♥♥♥♥ does that when options like Ren'Py exist?! I struggle to think of anything more blatantly amateur.\n\n'Amateur' -- that's the lesson today. Character sprites this nice deserved better. Much better. Stick with the works of Hanako, Ebi-hime, Christine Love or even Sakura Fantasy if you want a competent OEL yuri VN; you're not going to find one here.","January 5","false","0.5"," 344 of 480 people (72%) found this review helpful 29 people found this review funny","72","344","480","29","2"

The story is just too simple and childy (There is 0 creativity in it).\n-About the gameplay: The only thing you'll find is that decisions are almost inexistent.\n-The HUD is just painful, what is that resolution? 640x480?\n\nThis is a total mess.\nThe only thing that could have saved this game (in addition to the card drops) is the artwork. Every character has like 3~4 face gestures (If not less) and 50% of the time they don't fit the situation. Yet it still has some decent images(? (Excluding all the horrorific drawings made by NewWestGames. Seriously, what is this[i.imgur.com] AND THIS?[i.imgur.com] WTF!).\n\nIn conclusion: This game is terrible. I wouldn't recommend it even to my worst enemy. But it has cards and only 4 achievements for easy completion so...

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Faudraline/recommended/429580/","Faudraline","Faudraline","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Faudraline/","1196 products in account","A Wild Catgirl Appears is a really short - and not very well done - visual novel with a centering theme on female homosexuality. Yup, this is a Yuri title. I would really like to recommend this game, considering there aren't many otome visual novels that would even include same sex romance options and a game focusing on female homosexuality sounds like a concept to be supported - if only it would be better executed and accurately presented. Yet, the execution of the theme is really poor here, both with the boring narrative and non-existent character depth. It is just not a good game.\n\nHere we have Ami, a shy and nerdy teenage girl who attends an all-female high school, alongside her best friend Ria. Her parents travel throughout the year to attend business meetings, so Ami has all the time and the space in the world to herself, and she is lonely. Stating a useful fact on the side: she is also gay and faces the fear of being judged if she were to come out of the closet. To keep herself busy, she decides to attend the Coding Club of the school and start working on a platform video game that they'd make with the senior club president, Lise. At some point, the designed protagonist of the game; a ninja cat girl named Starla comes alive, mostly to Ami's surprise and distress. How to handle this situation now?\n\nLet's start with the display quality, shall we? There is an annoying inconsistency about the artworks and the CGs used for characters. Throughout my full playthrough, I've came across 4 different types of art works depicting the same characters ridiculously differently - none being appeasing or even anatomically correct. There has been some sorry attempts at presenting fan service, but no one should specifically prefer these ones for even that purpose. Environment designs are nothing remarkable or even remotely interesting, and the soundtrack is only forgettable. Oh, and there is no voice acting either.\n\nI wouldn't care much for the art quality if only there were to be somewhat decent narrative and an intriguing storyline. Well, there is none! The storyline doesn't carry any drama, mystery, insight, sentimental attachment or anything that would make Ami's story interesting. She - alongside four romance options - and her ordeal, her frustration is presented as shallow as it can be. There is no credible story progression, no real life solution to the subject matter or a character portrayal that would make us emphasize with Ami. Character interactions are downright boring, with superficial social exchanges playing on the idea of female sexuality. Whomever wrote that script, clearly had no idea about an actual female/female relationship. The developer only established a sorry setting to play on some fantasy here and earn some money from it while he is at it. Aside portraying wholly shallow characters, the narrative is full with grammatical errors and dialogues marked for wrong characters. Without any option to reread the dialogue once its passed, it becomes a problem to keep track of whomever said what, and without much you'd be curious about the story itself, you lose interest fast.\n\nTo top all the nonsense this game contains, save game function is completely broken. If it's a Win64, sorry people. You cannot save at all. Developers are trying to solve that problem at the moment, but it seems like a problem with the game engine itself, so... no near future solutions yet. At least there is a skip dialogue option to go for fast playthroughs to achievement hunt.\n\nAt the end of the day, you may prefer passing this one. There is nothing intriguing or esthetically pleasing here. Even people who'd buy this to take a glimpse on some girl on girl action could probably do with something else better.

And the characters are pretty cute. However, there are just too many things that let the game down. I've heard from other reviews that it was made in only a month, but I feel that that still doesn't excuse some of its issues.\n\nThe first thing I'll mention is the artwork. Some character shots are okay, whilst a lot of others are of pretty shockingly poor quality. Some simply show a poor grasp on anatomy (and not in the way of over-large boobs, as thats of course a style all of its own - more in the way of strangely twisted frames and limbs), whilst other genuinly look as though they've been edited in a couple of minutes in paints - like the originals, but with features altered or added with thick, black blurry lines. Other images seem to be have been scaled up and down strangely, whilst some of the backgrounds are of dramatically better quality than others.\n\nThe outcome seems difficult to control, and the ending abrupt. Theres also very little in the way of actual romance scenes, though I only played through once, so there may be more hidden in there (though I doubt it). I was offered very little lesbain cat-girl smut, but to futher cement things I was also offered very little in the way of romantic story, and so walked away from the game pretty unhappy in general.\n\nWhat else is there to say? Buttons are unresponsive, and take some trial and error to find - they're no where near their graphics. There is very little in the way of controls, with the game lacking even a basic volume control.\n\nIn conclussion, it is after all a pretty cheap game, even cheaper when on sale, and some may be able to look past its numerous faults in order to appreciate some hidden charms. If you're not new to visual novels, as I am, and are more willing to forgive, then give it a go. If not, I'd recommend passing it by.","January 7","false","1.4"," 29 of 35 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","29","35","0","0"

D:\n\nThis game is so bad I can barely believe it.\n\nIssues?\nNo text speed regulation. It's a must have for pretty much any visual novel these days.\nNo sound regulation.\nDid you pressed "skip" by mistake? Well, then you're screwed, since it skips all text (not just the seen one) and you can't go back just by scrolling.\nDoes your character thinks out loud? No, but you may have this impression, since there is no distinction in terms of font between your character dialogue and your character thoughts.\nDoes your character talk to herself? Nope, but sometimes name of speaking characters gets mixed so you have no idea what actually is going on.\nDifferent art styles. Woah! Awesome character models, right? Now there are CGs... That looks completely different. Plus some graphic elements that looks like they were done in Paint.\nCats are the worst part. I love cats. I also love girls, though not in the same way. So when you have cat girl in game it should be a good thing, right? Especially if it's kind of important character. You know. From your game title, and logo, and such... Nope. Cat girls are both annoying and unrealistic as hell. The game was actually better before they showed up.\nPretty bad writing. Dialogues doesn't look even remotely realistic.\nBoring protagonist.

No one apart from Ria ever gives her a hard time.\n\nThere's also Lise, who's talent and natural gifts apparently knows no bounds. I can write off her ability to make 3D models in a night because I can assume that she's both talented and doesn't leave the school to go home at any point, but I can't ignore the fact that she and Ami make their own Intendo based chip-containing figure which is able to give players various rewards in the game they decide to make.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B58EH-nNbq8\n\nMain menu is badly scaled along with the font, all the characters are off center, the dialogue box is cut off, when making a desicion, the buttons aren't calibrated and the bonus art screen is just...

A lot of these things are issues noted in previous reviews, but I felt a lot of them seemed a tad on the aggressive side, so let me try my hand at this.\n\n-The art is really inconsistent. The basic conversation models I like, but once you get into actual "scenes", bodies look strange and different, as if the head were cut and pasted onto someone else's work. This didn't bother me as much as it did other people, but I can certainly understand why it would be a turn off.\n\n-The writing and story seemed... rushed. I will admit that the entire plot seems a little cliche, but that wasn't my issue. As an author, what bothered me was that the game seemed to want to rush the relationships into your face as soon as possible, with very little development of ships or the characters to serve as the meat of the romance sandwich. At face value, the characters are cute and likable, but if you go a bit deeper there's just something... lacking.\n\n-The routes are really unclear. My first playthrough, I ended up with Ria when I was making every choice with the intent of trying to cater to Starla. It left me questioning where the route divulged, and that's not good for a visual novel. While this wouldn't be a major point if the story and choices weren't the focus of the game, they are so it impacts the experience pretty heavily.\n\nNow, onto what I enjoyed:\n\n- The characters, as I said, are likeable, at least at face value. We have a few of your common archetypes here, and they're all character tropes that I enjoy seeing. The shy nerd, the hyperactive goofball, the aggro tsundere, they all made for a funny experience to me. Not only that, but the art that wasn't odd-look appealed to me. I mentioned being an author, but I've also been drawing for about 10 years now, and I like the way the characters look.\n\n- Despite the lack of character development, things in general are very quirky, in a good way. There were certain things that made me chuckle, and why the catgirl thing has been done to hell and back, that doesn't make it bad. Despite the aspects the game falls short in, it still has its own kind of charm.\n\nSomething to keep in mind is that my first dating sim of any kind was Huniepop, which is vastly different from most dating sim/visual novels. I knew what to expect with a typical one like this, but I think I may still be holding things to Huniepop standards. This is by no means a terrible game, it just feels more like someone's first attempt, a game I'd sit down to beta test for a friend rather than something that was obtained by paying money.\n\nI think, with a proper, dedicated staff, the devs of this game could really do something amazing, and I honestly look forward to what they put out next.","January 11","true","3.3"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","15","18","0","0"

And it pains me when I come across games like this that will turn people off to it before they get to any of the good stuff.\n\nI think the dev's heart was in the right place, as it's clear that he or she has played games like this before. And while the art style is Western, there are clear anime and general Japanese influences on the setting and some of the characters. But the art is just not very good, and the writing is incredibly weak. There's nothing interesting about any of these characters and the humor falls flat every time. The best that can be said is that it does take the difficulty of a same-sex relationship somewhat seriously. The music is better off muted, especially the time-of-day transition tune which fills me with rage.\n\nAnother issue is that whatever program this was made in (I've seen it before) has an awful UI. I'm guessing it's a free or low cost VN creator. There is extremely limited functionality for the player, and it seems to miss some clicks as well when in the save and load screen. You do get achievements and five endings which is a plus if you like the game. (Note: I'm not sure what the true play time of this was due to trading card idling but it's fairly short for each run).\n\nI'd avoid this one or at least don't get your hopes up too high for it if you get it from a bundle.","February 28","false","5.9"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","11","12","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lady_Dawn/recommended/429580/","Lady_Dawn","Lady Dawn","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lady_Dawn/","1303 products in account","I think my biggest problem with A Wild Catgirl Appears! is that the art styles are so vastly different at points that it throws me for a loop. Or maybe it's the dialogue? Or maybe it's the story line...\n\nEither way, I got this game in a bundle for under a buck and I still feel as though it wasn't a particularly good use of my time. It took me two hours to get all the achievements (only because I did read through one path in totality before giving up and using the oh-so-helpful skip button) and two hours for the rest of the card drops. After that, I'll never boot this game up again--why would I?\n\nLet's break this attempt at a visual novel down, shall we?\n\n.Characters.\nJapanese school girls who attend an all-girls school and have very little parental supervision for one reason or another. That about sums them up. One is moe, one is shy, one is a ninja, and one is a ninja student. And then there's you, the loner main character. The cast is very generic to the genre.\n\n.Story.\nYou and a classmate are creating a game in a coding club after school. An after school club that has no members yet somehow has the funding to make RIF figures for a fully-functioning game that you create in a couple of sittings. Right. Your main character, Ami, takes the newly-made figure home and, lo-and-behold, you have a living, breathing cat girl and her cat girl friend that inexplicably accompanies her right in the comfort of your room. Ta-dah! And, for our next trick, the game makes these catgirls fit into society just like everyone else while your main character struggles to figure out which classmate or catgirl she'd like to date most.\n\nThe time frame of the game is very slippery. It feels as though the events, particularly the conclusion, just sort of bluster by as though the devs don't want you to think too hard about the logictics behind them.\n\n"Inexplicable" is the key word for this game. There's a lot that doesn't get adequately described, but you're just kind of expected to accept things--much in the way that the characters do. No one questions the appearance of the titular "wild catgirl" and no one even seems to care that a half-naked girl wearing cat ears is wandering around among the general public. Ah, Japan.\n\nBut back to the story: the catgirl, Starla (which, I'm sorry, is such an ugly name), infiltrates your life and you guys have fun together and school and clubs and yuri undertones.The four girls you meet are all romance options and the ending you get is based heavily on the rare A or B options you get at points in dialogue\n\nWhich brings us to our next point.\n\n.Voice acting and dialogue.\nMost of it was irritating. Abrasive, even. I could forgive the voice acting if the things the voices said were at al interesting, but... Yeah, no. Not in the slightest. In fact, some of it felt stilted and/or forced coming from the mouth of a teenager or ninja catgirl.\n\n.Art style.\nI didn't play the game before the big patch that apparently changed the art style, but it feels as though bits of the old art style, which can be seen in the achievements, have been left over. In fact, the art style varies on a scene to scene basis. What was that saying about too many chefs in the kitchen? Point being that the hodgepodge of graphical styles, some good and some... atrocious, did nothing for the game.\n\n.Bottom line.\nIf you're a card and achievement collector, sure. Buy this on sale. If you're looking for the next greatest visual novel, steer clear.","March 28","false","4.6"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","7","8","0","0"

I still can't recommend this, but I did take a second look. (May 21/2016)]\n\nAfter playing two versions of this game, it does appear to have better functionality, but that doesn't change the fact that I still wouldn't recommend it. Does it run better? Sure. Does it run perfectly, or have all the issues been fixed? No. There are also things that can't be changed - such as the game itself in terms of characters, the story, etc.\n\nIssues/Flaws\nWould not allow me to take screenshots. [FIXED] Screenshots now work fine, as they do in any other game.\n\nThe game previously had a broken down mess of an auto skip feature. This now appears to work as it should, although I did still have issues getting it to stop in the right spot, sometimes. [FIXED] Still no scroll back, and the "skip" feature has to be accessed through the menu rather than being there on screen, which is a bit of a nuisance.\n\nSaving has been fixed with the new version of the game. All save slots work properly, both to save and load. [FIXED]\n\nResolutions are still a mess. They have apparently "fixed" this, but I still wasn't satisfied. Full screen works beautifully, which they did fix. But, if you shrink it down, you still get the black bars on the side of the screen. The "smaller" size of resolution is simply a tiny bit smaller than full screen, and you can't shrink it down more than that. The larger resolution makes the game look stretched out, and the characters and text look pixelated.\n\nStill no"options" menu. No options for adjusting the sound, for screen resolutions, for how fast or slow text appears on screen.. etc. The "menu" is essentially: save, reload, hide, skip and back to title. The lack of options is still a major downfall.\nOther Things I Didn't LikeYou get four love options, but one is practically non existant. Some girls are given more focus than others and it's unbalanced.\n\nVery little character development. Being that it's a short game, this can be hard to achieve. But it would have been preferable to have a few less options who are better fleshed out than have more options who feel shoehorned in.\n\nCat girls are overdone. Boring.\n\nWriting's okay. Not horrible, but not great.\nA Few Positive PointsDecent price tag. Would be better worth it if purchased on sale.\n\nFeatures trading cards and a few cute backgrounds and emoticons.\n\nNice change to have a VN that's strictly girl on girl relationships. I'm a heterosexual female, but it was tastefully done.\n\nReplayability if you want to get all of the endings, or all of the achievements.\n\nEasy achievements.\n\nI thought the artwork was nice.","May 21","false","3.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

Skylanders started it, and then Nintendo went and made the Amiibo figures that work with lots of different games like Super Smash Bros. Wii, and others. Then Disney got it and just ran with it- now you can find pretty much every Disney property in its own game, Infinity. Why, one of these days, you'll be able to buy a 3D printer program and RFID chip and just make your own. ...though what would you do if the RFID chip decided to not work, but even crazier, it suddenly changed into the very catgirl ninja you were coding into the game? Such is the idea behind A Wild Catgirl Appears .\n\nYou play as Ami, a high-school student in a Japanese girls school who's suddenly faced with a bit of a problem- the student council has handed down a decision- this year, every student has to join a club. This presents a bit of a problem- Ami's not that much of an athlete, and not that popular, so well... she ends up joining the school's coding club. There, she meets another person- another girl by the name of Lise, and they start working on a game, one that stars a catgirl ninja, named Starla. One day, Lise gets the idea to make an Amiibo-style figure of Starla. The figure doesn't work, but... the next day, Ami finds a surprise in her bed- one catgirl ninja who has no idea how she got there... yeah, that's pretty much the story.\n\nI'll say it right now- this is a VN with a yuri twist to it. Ami has the chance to end up with one of four different girls- Ria (the best friend), Lise (the coding club president), Starla (the catgirl ninja), and Eiko (another catgirl that just... appeared somehow).\n\nThe story, well... it leaves a lot to be desired. There are many errors in spelling and grammar that need to be corrected that ought to have been caught with a quick spellcheck and a read-through. Not to mention, the introduction of Eiko is handled really poorly- she just shows up out of nowhere with no major event or anything. It just sticks out that she's just there- she just shows up and is just there to be another possible love interest. Why not flesh them out a bit? It needs to be polished up, and there needs to be a reason as to why Eiko shows up other than "Oh, have some free DLC!"\n\nThe art is good- I just wish there was more of it. Almost every character picture is the exact same pose- and 90% of them are the same but with just the facial expressions changed. The backgrounds look nice, but more are needed- you can't pass off a pool locker room as a clothing store changing room, for example. Throw in some variety, throw in some new poses, and suddenly you have more variety and better understanding of the characters. There is a bit of skin, and it does imply a lot of stuff, but... I think this is another of those that ended up having material cut to get itself on Steam.\n\nHowever, there is one big, glaring error in this game- there are four different endings, and you can get any of them. However, once you get one, you need to close and re-launch the game to clear the event flags in order to get a different ending- if you play through the game a second time, you still get the first ending you got. I am rather surprised this wasn't addressed in the re-release. It's a glaring error that ought to have been smashed out somehow.\n\nLet's get down to brass tacks, here: I want to like this game. I think it has plenty of potential, and it could honestly benefit from plenty of TLC from its artists, writers and programmers. But until the game has at least the whole ending problem hammered out, I can't recommend this game. A bunch of smaller problems are building up into one big reason as to why you shouldn't pick this up. If a new edition of this comes out, I'll give it a look and write a new review. But until then? I can't justify anything higher.\n\nSteam wants three G-bucks for it, and I think that's mostly fair- though on sale would be even better. It's nice, but... it's unpolished. If I could call this a neutral review, I could- it's got problems, but it also has potential.\n\nTL;DR - A great windup, but the kunai falls far from the target. 5/10.","April 8","false","2.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I went in with no expectations or desires, and that was definitely beneficial to the experience.\n\nThis game is just very innocent, like an 8 year old's journal entry except with a little bit more cleavage. The writing looks like the authors used only the 100 most frequently used words in English, so it's very easy and fast to read. This honestly would be a pretty good game for someone learning English as a second language. They go to a mall! A beach! A cafe! It reminds me of a Spanish 102 lesson, and it kept my attention more than a Spanish 102 lesson because it had anime cat girls with big boobs in it.\n\nSpeaking of anime cat girls with big boobs, the art in this game is kind of a mixed bag. The standard character illustrations that you'll see the most of are quite nicely drawn, and they have enough different facial expressions to keep things fairly interesting. The backgrounds are fine, not overly blurry like some cheap VNs, and establish the setting of the game well enough. One thing that kind of took away from the graphics was the fact that I played it at the maximum available resolution (1600x1200) and the graphics looked to be scaled up to meet that resolution, which made them kind of blurred/pixelated. That resolution shouldn't be an option if it's just going to scale up and look terrible. I would rather have had a smaller window with sharp graphics than a large one with blurry graphics.\n\nWhen the art starts to fall apart is when the characters go off model from their standard illustrations. If a character is posed differently, their proportions become odd, their bodies or heads become chibi-fied in kind of a rough way, or they become pretty noodly and strange. It's very jarring to have a nicely illustrated and detailed character become a wiggly mess just because they needed a different pose, but it happens. Still, I was kind of charmed by this, so I'll totally let it slide. It made the whole thing seem like a high school project.\n\nThe writing in this game is fine for an anime catgirl VN. It probably would have taken away from the experience to have this thing read like a good, detailed book, so its relatively simplistic plotline and treatment thereof contributed to this game being a fairly easygoing time. The main character is a closeted high school lesbian, which is pretty cool, and most of the tension with the non-catgirl characters that arises from this made it fairly interesting. It also was a nice stark contrast to see how the catgirls didn't really care about sexual orientation, which further separated them from the realm of the real. The game's inclusion of catgirls and non-catgirls to romance (or friend-mance? There wasn't a terrible amount of romance in this, honestly) made things interesting, although I ended up getting all the catgirl endings first because of my natural inclinations.\n\nFinally, the music in this game was surprisingly pleasant. It was incidental and non-obtrusive. There were some fairly long stretches of the game that did not have any background music, which was disappointing, but the music that was there was well made and fit the game very well. I particularly liked the chiptune song that played over the credits.\n\nOverall, I don't think anyone who is considering this game is expecting this to be an edge-of-your-seat, tour-de-force emotional rollercoaster (although there is a physical rollercoaster in this game). A lot of the negative reviews seem to be knee-jerk reactions to the relatively shoddy quality of the game, and that's fair. But if you're looking for a quick and innocent little game that expects nothing from you, then this is worth the three dollars that these devs are asking.","January 5","true","3.2"," 27 of 55 people (49%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","49","27","55","4","2"

Game lasts about 50 mins. About 60% of that is the beginning, 30% the middle, and the last 10% makes up the incredibly rushed ending.\n\nThe game is front loaded with a lot of pop culture references. That, combined with the rushed ending, makes me think that someone wrote the beginning in a single sitting beause they had the idea for the game, and then when they went back to it they didn't really know where to take it. That's my only explanation, aside from that maybe different people wrote different sections and it didn't come together as well as they'd hoped.\n\nThe new art is nice (just happened to play this game on the day the update was released), but the proportions are a bit off.\n\nLastly, I have to ask...what the hell is going on? How is it possible that on three separate runs, I keep ending up with Eiko? While choosing completely different choices each time? Is it a glitch in the new version? I mean, these types of games are essentially flow charts. Is Eiko like Rome, in that all roads lead to her and her brand new apartment? If that's the case, then what are those secret achievements?

There aren't too many choices but its better to have more slave slots then not enough. The character art looks solid, especially for what looks like the first release by this group (person?), but the backgrounds and variation of artwork could be improved. Text skips should also be included, so we don't have to wait for the sentences to fully scroll before continuing. There are also occasional hiccups with artwork being incorrectly displayed for a few frames.\n\nThe story isn't too bad, though I have yet to finish it. The characters are all pretty distinctive, and play on many cliches and tropes. There are also a lot of references to the real world. (Intendo, Fire Shield, etc) It is amusing, and doesn't take itself seriously at all. The music is decent as well, though a little repetitive.\n\nThe game is just three dollars though, and the store page screenshots pretty much show exactly what you're going to get, at this price I can say I feel like you could do a lot worse. Plus, this game has catgirls.","January 5","true","0.6"," 34 of 94 people (36%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","36","34","94","3","0"

Your best friend Ria introduces you into a hobby after school class in where you meet another girl who teaches coding. You make a character and she comes to life. So now you have all these different girls all craving attention.\n\nThe game plays very linear with only very few choices to make which are pretty simple ones.\n\nPositives:\n+ Cheap\n+ Funny plot\n+ Achievements and badges\n\nNegatives:\n- It would be good if there was spacebar to go to next text as mouse clicking is harder for me with my setup\n- Artwork can get very rough at times and feel very out of place\n- Lack of variety in the backdrops\n- No sound sliders to adjust audio levels\n- Lack of story decisions, you feel like you're reading more often than not\n- Very minimal in terms of character interactions with others than the main characters and no cute boys\n\nI myself enjoyed this game, apart from the abudance of negatives most are easily overlooked if you're looking for a very simple VN. It's a very cheap game and a fun one at that, the story is pretty wild and unbelievable and that's what I like about it.\n\nI would recommend it to gamers who are looking for a cheap and fun blast on a romance visual novel as long as you are not expecting too much. I would also recommend it to badge and achievement hunters as they are easy to stack up and obtain. A full playthrough takes around 1.5 hours.\n\nI would not recommend it to gamers who expect a higher quality game; this is not it. The plot is not that deep and is quite wacky. The graphics are also not the best meaning if you care for graphics in a visual novel you will more than likely dislike this game. I would also avoid if you like making a lot of choices in VN's because this VN simply falls way short of that bar with only very minimal choices.\n\nScore: Buy it","January 5","true","4.3"," 24 of 80 people (30%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","30","24","80","6","0"

In reality, the art styles are very inconsistent, the dialogue is lazy and even lacks proper grammar at times, it's far too linear for a visual novel and even the interface looks like it was just ripped from MS Paint and sloppily pasted onto the screen. I wouldn't reccomend wasting your money on this and I normally love anime visual novel games. Sorry! :(","January 25","false","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'm a big fan of visual novels, and so I can judge fairly harsh. This is by no means a professional review, it's just my thoughts on the matter. But I'll give it in simple terms:\n\nPros:\n- Decent character art.\n- Decent background art.\n- Decent music\n\nCons:\n- Short (can be considered a pro if you hate it)\n- Weak characters\n- Weak plot\n\nBasically, in my own opinion, this is a very bad visual novel. I can see effort was put into this, but.. it just doesn't hold up in the end.  I won't even go into the options.. or rather, the serious lack of them.\nI may very well dislike this visual novel because I prefer long and in-depth stories, with a lot of character development. I think that's only natural. This just doesn't feel right, whatsoever. Ahh, opinions, don't we love 'em? Anyway, if you're going for all achievements, or just want to do all routes, you better start using the skip option. The story is identical except for a few different lines - regardless of the option you choose. After a few lines of "new" dialogue it goes right back onto the same story as if your choice didn't matter. The only significance your choices have are.. let's just say, you get a point for a girl if you choose the "correct" option. Whatever girl you have the most points with in the end, you'll end up with.\nAll that being said, it's all good if you like simple, short stories and yuri romance.\n\nTL;DR: If you like a simple story with some romance and girl on (cat)girl action, give it a go. If not, stay away.","May 18","false","11.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I love Starla and Eiko, but I love catgirls, even when they\'re naive.  The game does have some text issues that need to be fixed.  Sometimes words are missing in sentences, words are mispelled, or the wrong name is up for the speaker.  Overall, it\'s a quick funny game and it was probably someone\'s starting project so I can\'t complain too much.  It\'s worth $2.99.  I got it for $1.49 of something a few weeks ago when it was only 50% off.  Anyway, I would recommentd this game to anyone in need of a short funny game to play through.  Try it for yourself before judging the game.","June 1","true","4.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
