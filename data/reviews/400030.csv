"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Official_KwS/recommended/400030/","Official_KwS","KidwithSmurf","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Official_KwS/","827 products in account","*Review for v1.3.209*\n\nFor a free Flappy Bird style game where you dodge trees, collect coins and unlock achievements, I thought this would be interesting and fun. However, upon playing it, it seems as though it was made for one platform and then rushed out onto Steam as fast as possible. Therefore, read below to find out my pros and cons.\n\nPros:\n♦ Good Graphics and Sounds (Sound is relaxing; trees/backgrounds/our character are well detailed)\n♦ Controls just work (This is because pressing any button on the keyboard, works as “Tap” to make your character move)\n♦ Well made for a 24hour game\n♦ Easy Steam Achievements (Just by playing the game you easily unlock them)\n♦ Steam Leaderboards (This is awesome as they just seem to work)\n\nCons:\n♦ Cross-Platform that hasn't fully been tested on all platforms released for (The game itself works, however everything from buttons, in game icons, menu's etc are all mobile styled. Plus, the game tells you to tap to play even though I'm on a computer without a touchscreen. Also as the game is cross-platformed it looks as though it was built for Mobile and the devs just hoped it worked for other platforms without actually fully changing everything and testing it on the other platforms than Mobile)\n♦ No Full Ingame Options Menu only a Unit Options Menu outside the game which tends to be broken  (This is annoying as you can't change resolution, graphics etc only Sound within the game and have to use the Unity Option Menu outside of the game which tends not to work most of the time and has control options when the game has no controls as every button works as a "Tap")\n♦ Resolution and Fullscreen Problems (I had to play windowed because the game auto started in fullscreen and the menu was pushed far right and I couldn't get it back without hitting alt+enter)\n♦ No distance and time counters in game (This is weird as your total distance and time is shown on the death score screen)\n♦ Makes you check it's website for cross platform leaderboards (This is nifty as it tells you who got what score and what platform they were using... but on PC with Steam, it should have a built in mechanism in the game to check these leaderboards without automatically opening an external Steam Browser window and loading the game devs website to view the leaderboards)\n♦ Sometimes coins are few and far between (This is annoying as some rounds you can have more coins than others making it extremely hard to get anywhere in the game and even register a score)\n♦ Hitbox sometimes can be off (It's jerked me into branches above me that I should never have been able to hit with the jump I made)\n♦ 3 star rating system isn't calculated properly (I keep getting random amounts of stars each time I finish. Also, I got 2 stars on 10 coins which took me 31 seconds to do. Hence, stars seem pointless, too easy to get and not calculated properly)\n♦ No actual tutorial (This is bad as there is nothing to tell you that collecting x number of coins increases your speed regen. Plus there is nothing to tell you how time, x number of coins and distance works together to give you a score. There is only a splash screen explaining minimal things)\n♦ Time and Distance seems pointless (This is the case because it seems like collecting coins is the only factor for score)\n♦ Can't get back to Main Menu from within the game after you click play (This is annoying as you have no way of going back to the main menu to click either of the leaderboards buttons to view them)\n♦ Branches can have too small a gap to fly through (This is annoying as if the branch itself is the only one you can reach to fly through and the gap is too small, then out of no fault of your own, you have to waste your score and round)\n♦ Requires you to accept EULA before being able to play (This shouldn't be the case as a game that is free and pretty much copies Flappy Bird imo shouldn't have or need an EULA as the game really is Flappy Bird with a reskin (Trees instead of pipes and a Dragon instead of a Bird) etc)\n♦ Sliding Issues with hitbox on Ground forcing you to close the game (This was claimed to be fixed, but I just managed to get it to happen again which shouldn't be the case as when you hit the ground you should die. However, I just slide until I come to water which I drown and then the screen just keeps sliding. I can't "TAP" to fly or anything, therefore, as I can't return to the main menu, to keep playing I must quit the game and re-open it)\n\nOverall, even though the game is playable, it has a lot of areas that could be improved especially for a PC version/ Non-Greenlight Steam version of the game as shown by the numerous cons and few pros. Therefore, even though it is a free game and you get what you get, I still can't recommend this unless you like 100% cross-platformed games that are made in 24hours and look 100% as though it was made for a mobile device and mobile UI with minimal to no changes it. I can also recommend this if you really love Flappy Bird rip-offs with poor hitboxes.","January 19","false","1.2"," 75 of 90 people (83%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","83","75","90","5","19"

I understand that every thief needs to make a living. BUT this game is pure bad.\nIt is a mobile game straight ported to steam.\nThe menu has visual glitches\nthe tapping mechanic has this weird system that makes you literally fly almost to the top of the level if you TAP a little too close together.\nA lot of the gaps in the tree leaves/branches (which are the obstacles) are too small to pass through. Also the hitboxes of the obstacles are a little too big.\nThe coins that you collect literally do nothing other than act as a score, a bit of a bummer.\n\nOverall, I do not recommend this game even if it is free, you will not enjoy the experience.\nThere's an achievement for lasting 15 minutes in a single flight but I could not be arsed to play any longer.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Shrodu/recommended/400030/","Shrodu","Shrodu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Shrodu/","163 products in account","(This game was another game suggested by a user called Pink Lily)\n\nEDIT:  Some fixes remove some of the cons.  These fixes will be noted by strikes.\n\n--------------------------------\n\nDeep within the depths of Steam.  Buried underneath thousands and thousands of Steam games lies a game called Cloney which was apparently released March 15, 2014 yet just now has come to the attention of achievement hunters.  Is it a legendary treasure that hunters are seeking?   From my understanding, this "attention boom" comes from recently gaining achievements.  As someone who's unearthed this treasure chest, I can verify it's more like a container that holds a monster rather than a treasure.  Pandora's box holds a monster who should have stayed buried.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3ythpzsu18\n\nCloney is just as it sounds.  It's a clone game.  Now, I've seen reviews calling this a rip-off of something called "Flappy Birds", a game I've never played but have heard about many times.  After looking it up, it looks exactly like it with the exception of being able to pick up coins (which will count as your score rather than distance).  If this isn't bad enough, the developer itself confirms that this is a clone of Flappy Birds.  For a game that was made in 24 hours, it's a decent attempt, but there are horrors to this game that make it one that should have stayed buried.  And as far as the title is concerned, "A tapped out adventure"?  You'll find yourself p*ssed off and your hand either spazzing out (like mine) when you need to concentrate or you'll find yourself tapping-out (quitting).\n\nThe model of the main character (which seems to have been a screamer from the trailer of the game) looks familiar....too familiar....have I seen this model before?  Yes.  In Orion: Prelude.  Cloney the character is just a copy of the dragon model from Orion: Prelude, which is most likely some open-source model developers either pay for or nab for free.  Without a credits page, I can only confirm that the usage of this model is PLAGIARISM!\n\nAside from the character, the music is.....pretty bad.  But we'll get back to this in a bit.  I will say that the only redeeming factor physically would be the backgrounds which are well-done, but I don't know if the developer itself actually made the backgrounds or nabbed them from somewhere else.\n\n\nNow, for the gameplay.  You may think "Easy 100%" and if you're someone who has good rhythem and patience, you'd be right.  But even then, the price is one's sanity. You'll find yourself losing easilly and in a matter of seconds.   The two final trials to test your mettle are "Gather 40 coins" and "Live for 15 minutes"....simple enough, yes?   No....wrong.   Dead wrong.  Gather 8 coins and your speed increases.  When your speed increases, you are less able to have time to analyze and dodge.\n\nAs for the "15 minute" achievement challenge, had to redo this about 7-10 times...got close 3 times only to lose within the last 2 minutes or (on one occassion), the last 24 seconds.  To gauge my time, I had to have the TV on in the background (one half episode and an entire commercial break is long enough to help out...listen to it to gauge to your time).   My experience each time is similar to what I've seen Eversion was like...except I admit it was all in my head.  The repetitive music....became demonic as my sanity slipped away.  I could swear I saw pentagrams on the ground and burning red fire where the branches that kill were.  I saw the dragon turn into a red ball, which didn't work well as a hitbox (hitbox appears to be somewhat larger than your character.  It was a terrible experience.\n\nThere is only one endless level...one mode.  It's basically plug-n-play.  Easy to boot up and just play without a story or forced tutorial.  So at least it has that going for it.\n\n\n\nPROS:\nNice looking backgrounds\nWas made in 24 hours\nFree\nAchievements\nNo forced tutorial  (In fact, no tutorial at all)\n\nCONS:\nNightmarish achievements (40 coins and Live for 15 minutes.  Edit: Now a little more tolerable with an active pause function)\nNO PAUSE BUTTON\nGame breaks on some occassions (Dragon will stay on the ground, go under water....cannot reset game)\nPressing ESC during the game shuts it off\nPoor music choices\nBLATANT PLAGIARISM  (Devs put credits on a website, but still need IN-GAME credits.  People who do not visit the website will come to the same conclusion)\n\n\nI'll be honest, this game made me sick to my stomach.  It was easilly one of the worst Steam experiences I've had on Steam.  If you like free games or want to try getting some easy achievements (100% won't be so easy though), then go ahead and try, but don't say I didn't warn you.\n\n\n0.5/10   Achievements are nice, but I'd rather be playing a bad game like One Manga Day than this.  Terrible experience.","January 22","false","2.8"," 16 of 20 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","16","20","2","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/XaMcTepA/recommended/400030/","XaMcTepA","♫ MoPcKo cBuH4e :d","http://steamcommunity.com/id/XaMcTepA/","186 products in account","I played this game for about 90 mins straight and after that my PC's screen was moving, my keyboard was moving, my head was spinning and I had an awful headache. Even a pill didn't help. The gameplay is kinda repetitive - you just tap so your dragon can fly, collect coins and try not to hit a tree. The soundtrack seemed cute and fun at first but easily got tired from listening to it after just 10-20 min so I had to mute the game. There are 2 achievements that require some luck/skill and patience. One of them is to collect 40 coins in 1 run. After just a few minutes in the game I somehow managed to get 38 coins. Maybe I was lucky. After a while I managed to get 50 coins. My point is that this is one of the two positive things I am going to say about "Cloney" - when I was at 30 or so coins my heart started beating faster. I was excited will I make it or not. The other positive thing is that you can make your dragon sneeze, which I found cute. The other achievement is to survive 15 minutes straight without dying. Luckily I managed to get it fairly quick and got all achievements in just a bit over 2 hours. A friend of mine played nearly 9 hours to get them all. Poor guy! What I am trying to say is that these 2 achievements can be a real pain in the neck, so unless you want to get all of the achievements and a 100% game don't even bother playing "Cloney". It's really bad. Not worth your time. There are many better free games on Steam. Speaking of "free", If I had paid money for this game I'd be angry right now, seriosuly. I am glad it's over!","March 31","false","2.3"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Sure its like flappy bird, but I think its an improvement or upgrade of flappy.  I enjoyed it for 20-30 minutes.  Got all the achievements except the "last 15 minutes" achievement, which is the most challenging achievement in the game.  I give it a 9/10.  I highly recommend Cloney!","January 24","true","0.3"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

Thats what allot of other people who reviewed don't seem to get. The sounds are nice and the game plays smoothly, just a shame its based on mobile and you can't go fullscreen.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Xu9xYFcyF0","January 20","true","0.3"," 4 of 12 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","4","12","0","2"

You hit things from miles away.\nThe achivments are damn hardcore. That's a good thing, don't get me wrong. But survive 15 minutes in one run are just... no...\nThe level design... wat. You have some bushes that are impossible to dodge(the ceiling ones). Not many. But a very few is leading you in to get two tokens. Then a branch just flings straight up into the ceiling leaving you only to die.","May 14","false","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
