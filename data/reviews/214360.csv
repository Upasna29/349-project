This game was released in August 2012, so by the time I encountered the bug I saw, it had already been released over half a year.  I was playing what was promoted as a released non-alpha, non-beta, polished, clean product.\n\nBy telling players "this is just alpha code" - all sorts of bugs are forgiven.  It just changes the whole tone, and it also scares players like me away.  I don't want to be anybody's alpha or beta tester and pay for it unless the game is extremely compelling.  That's just my personal approach as a consumer.\n\nSo I don't know if my review is a troll.  If anyone asked me "do you recommend this game" - my review is exactly what comes to mind when I see this game, especially when I visit the forums and get that dirty message in red at the top.  It was a power play by the dev "you didn't follow protocol.  Nananana."  Or at least that's what it felt like for me getting banned.\n\nToday I played 2 multiplayer games, and I didn't see the issue that had happened before.  It's quite possible that the issue has been addressed.\n\nAnd there's really no point in dwelling on "here's what so and so did wrong".  I'd rather find a solution, and for me that solution is, it's much safer to call a game alpha than go through this sort of mess.\n\n--------------------------------------- ORIGINAL REVIEW BELOW ------------------------------------\n\nYou have been permanently banned from all Tower Wars discussions.\nYou were banned by a Tower Wars developer.\nReason: "Not following protocol to submit a bug report."\n\nThis is how this developer treats customers.  If the customer runs into a problem with the product, ban them from the forums.  Permanently.  Which leaves a pretty bad taste in my mouth.  I can't recommend a game by a dev who treats people like this.\n\nAnd for the gory details: my mouse would lock up attached to an object in the middle of games.  I couldn't\ngo to the menus, NOTHING.  Multiplayer games would log me as having quit the game, when it was a bug.\nOf course NOBODY else saw this bug.  Well it turned out, eventually, that I figured out (no thanks to the\ndevs) that this only happened when my video settings were maxed out (monitor is 2560x1600).  So there\nwas a workaround - and they might have addressed this too.\n\nBut I'm still banned from their forums.\n\n\n[EDIT: It looks like they have indeed added a single player campaign, so I've removed the statement that signle player is missing.]\n\n\nAvoid this one.","July 4, 2014","false","25.5"," 640 of 790 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","640","790","0","52"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/recommended/214360/","TeamTom","TeamTom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/","2818 products in account","Tower Wars is a tower defense game combined with army building. This indie title was released in August 2012, so has been around for a while coming in with about 400k owners on Steam.\n\nAs with other tower defense games, you start out with a blank battlefield, although this version of tower defense is slightly different to others, you are also fighting against an opponent, who is also building towers on their blank battlefield. The aim of the game is to get your army into the enemies base to destroy their castle before they destroy yours.  Tower Wars has two currency systems, Gold and Battle points - you are able to generate gold via the mines which are already located on your map; you can do the usual technique with tower defense games and upgrade them so that they generate more gold and are quicker at it. Battle points come through sending units to your opponent and working their way to the castle, this of course requires gold though.\n\nYou build units from your barracks with gold, there is a build queue which you can fill up however you please with different assorted units which you can train, and then push them all out in one go. Your barracks has a cool down so you can only push one wave out every 40 seconds or so. Some units are basic, some have their own special abilities, and some even increase the stats of the whole wave, regardless of whether they are near the units or not.\n\nThe tower building side of things is again, very similar to other tower defense games, you are able to position your towers pretty much anywhere you want on the map, allowing you to create all sorts of death traps, and corridors that your foe has to battle through, obviously the more ground the opponent has to cover, the more damage you can do to them with your turrets. There are plenty of the normal sort of turrets, such as cannons and arrow launchers, but there are also some really unique ones, such as a huge fan that pushes your opponents back in a certain direction, this makes for some great end of hallway traps!  All of the turrets are able to be upgraded in the usual fashion too, however I didn't really find the need to do that in the single player mode.\n\nTower Wars has a really nice looking graphic and art style; they are really polished and it looks like a lot of care and attention has gone into making this a beautiful steam-punk looking game.\n\nThe difficulty in Tower Wars takes a huge ramp up once you get past the tutorial. I will say though, the game's tutorial is really helpful and gets you to grips with the UI and all of the basic elements of the game. It does leave out a few bits that mean you have to go digging around and use a bit of trial and error to see what is what, but that's part of the fun of this type of game.  There are also an abundance of guides, and wiki posts out there if you really want to get into the nitty gritty of it.\n\nSince the game is almost four years old now, the multiplayer scene seems to have died down a bit, at the time of writing this there are only  ~30 people playing the game, but thankfully the game does have the option for co-op, so that may peek the attention of some people\n\nTechnically, this game has a lot of graphical options, allowing you to cater it for your rigs power and capability, coming with plenty of resolution options too.\n\nI have put about six hours into Tower Wars so far, and given that matches against the UI/Bots can sometimes last anywhere between 45 minutes and an hour, you can expect to get a lot of gameplay out of this even on the single player mode. If you manage to find yourself a group of friends to play this with, you are looking at a major time sink with ample amounts of fun and content.  I will definitely be carrying on playing Tower Wars after writing this review, since it also has that addicted sort of gameplay that I just cannot put down.\n\nThankfully, due to the price of Tower Wars being Â£5,59, I am going to strongly recommend this title, if it was any more I would have just said to pick it up when on sale due to the lack of multiplayer activity, but because it is already a low price as it stands, I can easily say you will get at least five or six hours of enjoyment out of it. Hardcore tower defense fans should not miss out on this game!\n\n1) Stay away\n2) Only recommended when on sale\n3) Recommended\n4) Highly recommended\n5) This is a must play\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

Nothing special here, typical set of towers available.\n\nYou send your own armies to attack enemy in order to get battle points which allow you to unlock new units and upgrade old ones. There's more freedom here, and if you know what you're doing, this is a great place to showcase your tactical skills, especially at late stages of the game when some interesting units are available.\n\nThere's also a little resources gathering aspect to the game.\n\nBiggest trick is to efficiently balance your defence, offence, upgrades and resources. If you screw up anywhere, you're done.\n\nThere's one huge problem with this game, which is why this is a negative review. It has pretty much no tutorial available, no single-player campaign to gradually develop your skills, UI is un-intuitive, controls are messed up, etc. All you have are bots, weakest of which will probably defeat you up to five times untill you grasp basics of the game, and after that you only have try-and-fail approach to figure out why some more sophisticated things work and some don't.\n\nAnd then, playing multiplayer, game becomes over-competetive pretty fast, so unless it's inline whith your character, you will not be able to really casually enjoy the game ...\n\nIt's a pity, if devs would've spent a little more time to implement decent in-game tutorial and usable UI and controlls, game would be much more playable.","June 25, 2014","false","4.6"," 81 of 111 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","81","111","0","1"

If it would have been a perfect game, it would have gotten a 10 for a really cool mix-up of the genre. But sadly, it's far from perfect. This game has a VERY steep learning curve, and when it was first released it had virtually no singleplayer until they updated it, but guess what? The first bot for singleplayer is hard if you don't know what the hell to do, and the description for it says otherwise! Also, there isn't that much variation and only 10 bots to fight against, meaning this game is predominantly multiplayer, which I honeslty don't like for the TD genre. I'd say to skip this one and get Defense Grid: The Awakening instead if at full price, but it's on sale for 2 bucks frequently, and for that price, I'd say it's worth it.","November 2, 2013","false","8.2"," 55 of 75 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","55","75","0","0"

I really found that funny and great.\nLater, when I wanted to play it again, I wasn't able to remember the name or the website.\nAnd 2-3 years after, I saw Tower Wars. I bought it for me and some of my friends, and it became my favorite game. (I actually do like 2 or 3 hours every morning).\n\nTower Wars is a really beautifully designed Tower Defence with Steampunk like models, where you can place towers to defend your castle at the same time that sending units to try to destroy ennemy's castle. Towers are balanced, Units are quite too, maps details are awesome, musics are just PERFECT. Usually a Game can be between 25 and 60 minutes, 25-60 minutes of fun. And the fact that mines are placed randomly doesn't make you able to have a "perfect strategy", that's why you always have a chance to beat other players.\n\nI watched some other reviews, most of them are negatives. I will not injure them, but only one thing : Don't trust them. The game is really cheap, so you can simply test yourself. I don't see any problems with the SinglePlayer Bots, I just beat all of them exept the 2 last ones that are 'cheating', with only 2 loses (#4 one and #7 one). Also this game is really fun on Multiplayer, even more at 2v2 and 3v3 Matches, most of the other players I fighted were kind and sympatic.\nAnd seriously, THE ONLY THING for me Tower Wars didn't do well is Achievements (Some of them beeing near-impossible to do (and 1 Impossible) and lots of them where you have to do on Ranked Matches), otherwise EVERYTHING ELSE IS PERFECT. Some updates are added between seasons, to balance even more the game. Developpers are kind, Game is perfect.\nNow my only question is how can a such awesome game have that much negative reviews.","July 29, 2014","true","132.1"," 16 of 18 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","16","18","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/recommended/214360/","mrninjasquirrel","MrNinjaSquirrel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/","1478 products in account","Tower Wars is an interesting idea bogged down by its excessive attempts to condense and entire tower defense experience into a single match.\n\nThe basic concept of Tower Wars is a competitive TD game where you control both the towers and the enemies, and have to balance throwing tons of grunts at the enemy castle while building up your own defenses to keep theirs away. Adding onto this is a huge upgrade tree, from unlocking new grunt types, to passive upgrades for all units, to upgrading your towers and already unlocked grunts. Essentially everything can be upgraded several times over, and with a limited amount of resources you need to pay careful attention to what you invest in or else be overrun by the other player.\n\nIf this sounds like a lot to take in, that's because it is. Tower Wars is absurdly involved, as it takes the features that would normally be slowly added over the course of a typical TD game and instead gives you them all for the one self contained match you are already in. As a result it's incredibly overwhelming, and causes matches to stretch on for far longer than they have any right to. The tutorial match alone took nearly an hour, and my first match against the easiest AI opponent in the game about 30 minutes more (which ultimately ended in my defeat). If you're going up against a real human opponent of equal skill, expect this time per match to only rise further, which creates a huge commitment on the player that could ultimately prove for naught.\n\nUltimately Tower Wars asks too much of the player without giving them a reason to stick with it through the long periods of tedium that inevitably occur after the first 10-15 minutes when you've placed most of your towers and begin the long game of tug of war, as you incrementally chip away at each other's castles until someone gets a lucky break and finally pushes through. The concept is a really neat one, but the way it's executed here is dull and overly complex to the point I was begging for defeat simply so the match would be over. I love TD games, probably more than I should, but nothing about Tower Wars ever manifested itself into anything fun or engrossing and just left me feeling like I'd wasted my time and had nothing to show for it.","September 3, 2014","false","2.1"," 33 of 49 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","33","49","0","6"

To that end it's mainly a multiplayer game, though the last major update added ten levels of bots to lose to without anyone knowing your shame. It's a good thing too, because the odds of you getting a match against a person aren't very good these days.\n\nEach match gives you command over a castle, a barracks, and large tracts of hex-gridded land, all mirrored by your opponent. Your task is to send waves of attackers to destroy your foe's castle while maintaining a field of towers to defend your own castle. The resource that fuels both of these labors is gold, mined from upgradable plots in your territory, so right away you have a balance that must be struck between offense and defense. In addition, your attackers earn Battle Points for the time they spend (alive) in enemy territory. These points are used to unlock new units, upgrade your units, and upgrade your mines.\n\nIf all this is starting to sound complicated, well, it is. You need to be sending troops to attack, upgrading those troops, upgrading your mines, and managing your own towers, all based out of two resource pools. And yes, just the tower defense part is full-fledged tower defense, with the ability to place upwards of a hundred towers on a single map, of eight different types and three upgrade levels. Layering further complexity over that, while an interesting idea, makes the game a huge struggle to keep up with. It's basically Build Orders: The Game, so if that was your favorite part of Starcraft, there might be something here for you to latch onto.\n\nEven so, it's hard to give a positive review to a multiplayer-focused game with no player base. None of my half-dozen attempts to find a match, ranked or unranked over several days, met with success. Poking around the forums it seems there are only a few dozen active players left, and there may be something wrong with matchmaking that the developers have not addressed. It's just as well, because the complexity pushes it up into DOTA territory, long matches and all. A single round can last thirty minutes to an hour, and a loss after all that time really hurts because it earns you nothing. There are no unlocks or points or anything to chase, just match after match.

On one side of the defense you have a VARIETY of awesome towers that you can build and upgrade each with their own specific purpose (arrows, cannons, launchers, giant hammers, giant fans to slow enemies etc...). The castle is also upgradable by means of shield or ammunition effectiveness (that's as far as castle upgrades go). There are also unlock-able units as you play depending on what you want to unlock and they can also be upgraded. To go beyond upgrading simple units, the game has a upgrade system where you can add shields, armor, or even health to the units. The upgrade system (building) allows for other upgrades such as reduced wait time to send a wave of attacking units to your enemy, bigger barracks, spawn random units when deploying an assault, or upgrade battle points so you receive more. This game is also multiplayer which makes it all that much better!\n\nI would highly recommend this game. The visuals were done right, the sounds were done right, the units were done right, the delivery on the game play was done right. Variations and modifications are always welcomed and a simple layout style (with some random obstacles) always make for an interesting game.\n\nWarning though, one game can take 45 min to an 1 h. So don't expect to jump in and jump out. If you want a game that's not 45 minutes long I HIGHLY suggest CastleStorm which is sort of similar to this but a 2D (3D graphics) platformer.\n\n\nRATING : 8/10.\n\n\nGameplay	B+	Story / Campaign	N/A	Visuals / User Interface	B	Sounds / Music	B	Replay-ability	B	Overall 	B\n\nSmall update as of May 13th, 2015... a few of my friends have reported lag when there are a lot of units on the screen when playing multiplayer. Not sure if anyone else has experienced this.","July 21, 2014","true","16.8"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","91","10","11","2","0"

It is Tower Defense, but it is also Tower Assault! That's right, multi-tasking! However, the game does include just normal Tower Defense.\n\nYou need to gather points to both build towers and send units out to destroy your opponent's base before he destroys yours. The campaign mode features 10 missions against the AI that gets increasingly harder. Multiplayer is pretty quiet though, I don't believe there's many people on it anymore.\n\n\nTopic: Steampunk Tower-Defense Strategy\n\n\nReplayabilityGoodPrice TagGoodWith friends?RecommendedAge groupEveryoneDevsHelpful & Responsive\n\nSingleplayer9Story5Multiplayer7Gameplay9Controls7Graphics7Sound7Tower Defense9Strategy10Steampunk6\n*Curator's pick for STRATEGY*\n\nScore: 76/100\n\nThanks for reading!

You need a few hours to master all the mechanics, but then it's great entertainment.\n\nYou and your opponent both have castles and barracks, and you need to send waves to destroy each other, while simultaneously upgrading your units and castles as well as tending to your gold mines. Gold is mainly needed for recruiting units, and as long as they are within enemy territory, they earn "battle points" for you, which you need for upgrades. This makes for some challenging gameplay, as you need gold to earn battle points, but also battle points to get upgrades to earn more gold, ...\n\nThere are many different units, each with unique attributes - speed, health, damage dealt (against opponent's castle), armor, shield. Some have special abilities, e.g. they increase other units' speed or improve their shields.\n\nSimilarly, there are lots of different towers with unique strengths and weaknesses, e.g. arrow towers, cannons, lava distributors, fans (to slow down the enemy's units) etc.\n\nThere are a few maps shipped with the game and you can download additional maps from the community. The gold mines are always placed randomly, which means that for every match, you need to come up with a new path around which to build your defense towers (although you will always be using the same basic structures).\n\nI recommend that you buy this on sale and get additional keys for your friends, because as mentioned above, it's hard to even find opponents for multiplayer, and the matching can take ages. But I have spent way too many hours playing against buddies now and we're all hooked!\n\n\nPROS:\n[+] Challenging game mechanics\n[+] Awesome multiplayer mode (1v1, 2v2, 3v3)\n[+] Many maps to choose from and random adjustments in each round\n[+] Very cool steampunk setting\n\n\nCONS:\n[-] Steep learning curve (although this becomes rewarding if you don't give up early)\n[-] Very few people "out there" for multiplayer matches (but it's more fun with friends anyway)\n[-] Boring co-op mode","August 5, 2015","true","166.7"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

After over 80 hours of game play and frustration I learned that the secret to beating this game is competitive thinking, and a ballance of everything you have to do. You cannot focus on gold but not upgrade units. You cannot focus on units and not on upgrade shields and other abilities.\n\non top of all, your route that you creat for your enemy has to be complet and have many twists and turns. the more the enemy has to move atound corners and twist and turn, the slower they are.\n\nlava towers are almost useless, don't waste time with them. your best towers are the bows, cannons and fans to slow down the enemy. As well as the shock towers?\n\na good strategy of taking down shields, while being able to attack in a split second makes all the difference.\n\nIf you like a challenge and thinking on your feet. i highly reccommend this tower defence game.","July 26, 2014","true","96.4"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","6"

I found Tower Wars on sale and immediately grabbed as I'm a fan of worlds created with hexagonal terrains put together.\n\nThe game resembles Tropical Tower Wars, a custom WarCraft III map that I used to play. Instead of having a fixed pathways and a place for your towers, you create the maze yourself. The world is made out of hexagon tiles separated into different islands. Three gold mines for each team are randomly placed in the map to create diversity for your mazing strategies.\n\nControls[+] Not much to say on this as the game uses the most conventional controls for any Tower Defense game. In the time that I played I haven't felt any type of discomfort even once.\n\nGraphics[+] As I said before, I am a fan of game terrain made out of hexagon tiles.\n[+] The maps for different modes was well made allowing different kinds of strategies to be put to use.\n\nBalance[+] The bots are good for people who are learning the game. They start from easy and eventually gets more challenging as you defeat more of them one by one.\n[+] The game gives you freedom on how you want to handle your mazes.\n[+] It also has a route detector to make the game eye-friendly despite building a big amount of towers and stops you from messing up in case you get confused in your own maze.\n[-] Although it gets challenging as you pick higher level of bots. The only difference you see is the rate of how fast they upgrade their towers, and mines. They keep recycling the same strategy over and over.\n\nOthers[+] Variety of maps to choose from.\n[+] You can either play defensive, offensive, or balance depending on how you wish to control the game.\n[-] Few people are playing and on that "few people" even fewer people plays Human vs. Human. Thus, expect long queues when you want to play multiplayer.","March 16, 2015","true","4.8"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"
