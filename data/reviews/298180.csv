You're good at what you do and you have an enormous fan-following. But I think I'm gonna step aside for a sec and admire Scott's lesser appreciated work, and a game which has quickly become one of my favourite games of all time.\n\nSadly, I cannot remember if I came across this game by browsing "Games under £4" or if I only heard about it through Five Nights at Freddy's. But I'm so glad I found this game either way.\n\nSo what's the thingy happening, then? Well, you play as the re-programmed CPU of a video game controlling the body of a feisty coffee-pot with legs. You're stranded in a space station an unknown distance from Earth with 4 (once 5) super-computer robots who are trying to find a way to perfectly colonize distant planets for humans. Viruses are starting to take their toll on the simulations and the space station is on it's last shred of power, so it's up to you (and the AI of the coffee-pot) to gather as much resources as you can to take out the viruses before they ruin the mission.\nJust like FNaF, this is a really original concept.\n\nThe gameplay is broken up into several segments, all being from different genres of games, and you're constantly under a time limit; something you don't see in a lot of games. It's very reminiscent of Majora's Mask, in a way. This kind of gameplay mechanic would work in so many games which ignore it, like all the games where a big event is about to happen, but you could do a lap of the world before it even begins.\n\nSome may argue that the gameplay gets very repetitive after a short while, and I'll admit there are a few places that get rather tedious, but fortunately it's much more engaging than FNaF. Also, just like FNaF, it's feels amazing to beat the game because of how much work goes into it.\n\nAnd as for Scott's signature art-style, this game is gorgeous! Scott captures the creativity, the vision and the desires of the Derelicts perfectly in their simulations. And as for the space station and surrounding area, it's awe-inspiring how lonely it feels. Don't even get me started on how good the soundtrack is.\n\nYou get all this, and a ton of depth and story, for just £3.99. It's a longer game than the Freddy Trilogy as a whole, and it's perfect for what it's trying to acomplish. I just finished this game clocking in 7 hours of gameplay and I can't wait to play it again.

Other than the lag, the game is basically a work of art.\nScott's art direction is really immersing me to play this game; maybe because it's the nostalgia that makes me want to play the game further until I finish it. Furthermore, it's a hybrid mix of mainly two genres: RPG and Platformer.\nThe game as a hybrid genre is a good thing, it doesn't just tire you with countless battles, but you also get to explore the world in a 2D way.\n\nScore: 4.5/5\nI could've given it a perfect 5, but I just have a feeling that it could be better than what it is.\nThe game gets repetitive, but at the same time addictive.\nOverall, the game is good and it's on my list of "favorite unappreciated games."\n\nP.S.: Even though it's free now, it's still the best $5 I've ever spent.","November 18, 2014","true","10.1"," 62 of 69 people (90%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","90","62","69","7","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/OneHandedSquire/recommended/298180/","OneHandedSquire","OneHandedSquire","http://steamcommunity.com/id/OneHandedSquire/","168 products in account","I am less than affluent (i.e. broke), therefore I will wait for anything and everything I want to play to go on sale.  Yes, even already cheap, obscure indie titles go on my wishlist until I see old man Steam is having one of his episodes and will trade me games for the unnamed contents of my pockets.  It also doesn't help that the obscure titles are less reliable in their overall ratings, so that I find myself owning games that give Steam refunds their raison d'etre.\n\nThe Desolate Hope, however, is not one of these.  The Desolate Hope is a game that, after playing it, I felt guilty for not kicking a couple bucks to before it became free.  To wish I had paid money for a thing I got for free is easily the highest praise a cheap ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ like me can give.\n\nAlright, so what is The Desolate Hope?  Every time I try to explain its premise to someone, I come off sounding like a kid that's upended a forty of Pixy Stix.  So here goes:\n\nImagine that you are playing as Minesweeper.  No, not playing Minesweeper.  You are the computer program, Minesweeper.  You came preinstalled and have been idling in memory for someone to enjoy your frustrating trial-and-error gameplay.  Finally, you are activated; not by an eager player, but by a greater intelligence, the likes of which you can barely begin to circumscribe with your puny Minesweeper brain:  the AI for a robotic coffee pot.\n\nYour new coffee pot overlord has downloaded you into its body, while it oversees the vital functions of the space base you both occupy.  Your mission is to explore the base (long abandoned by humanity), gain the trust of several derelict robots that were once in charge of terraforming the planet, and seek out and eliminate a virus stealing data from the simulations they are running.  And you must do all of this before the station runs out of power in only a few days time.\n\nDuring the day, you will explore the Derelicts' dream worlds, the visualization of their efforts to build a home for humanity: their simulations.  At night, you will roam the barren wasteland of the forgotten planet the base rests on, looking for lost artifacts of humanity to offer up to the Derelicts so that they might offer their help to fight the virus.\n\nYou will face challenges that lesser coffee pots would buckle before and uncover the hidden secrets of the base, for all is not as it seems.  Also, there's a magic wrench and a spider named Sigfried.\n\nTruly, a tale as old as time.\n\nThe visual aesthetic is quite impressive. Though it does have that Sega CD/Saturn era pre-rendered style that looks kind of old and janky now, I hadn't realized that I do have some nostalgia for that.\n\nRegardless, the character models and environments in the simulations are very imaginative.  The Derelicts and viruses appear almost like something out of Aztec or Hindu mythology; towering over their private realms that are certainly science fiction, but have a magical feel about them.  But it wasn't until I was walking on the planet's surface as a tiny, lone silhouette against the void of space that it really hit me what a beautiful game this is.\n\nOf course, you want to talk gameplay.  Like the premise, it's hard to describe the gameplay without sounding like I'm vomiting up the product of a the orgy between a big pile of ideas (eww).  I have a feeling the game design document reads something like this:\n\n"Yo dawg, I heard you like video games.  So we put some video games in your video game so you can play video games while you game."\n\nOutside the simulations, the game is at its most reserved.  Your coffee pot body is exceptional in that it can move around.  But that's all.  At this level, the game is an adventure game where you explore and collect items... and play Space Invaders at certain times, but that's neither here nor there.\n\nInside of the simulations, you are playing a free-roaming platformer where you can jump and shoot energy blasts and other such feats of percolation heretofore unknown to coffee pots.  You can dive into sub-simulations where the game becomes a top down vector-based shooter where you kill enemies to gain cabbages.  Makes sense? What if I told you a vector rabbit follows you around and translates them into free memory you can use to upgrade yourself?\n\nWhen you locate the virus, the screen swirls into a disco wonderland and the game becomes real-time JRPG style  combat where you control the four Derelicts against the virus.  And if that wasn't enough, we can go one deeper.  Within the real-time JRPG combats, one of the best moves for each Derelict is to call up a mini-game (each of the four gets a different one and you can have them all running simultaneously) that you can play to get buffs.\n\nSome would say that sounds schizophrenic.  Normally, I'd agree, but the Deolate Hope manages to take these disparate gameplay styles and use them to inform, further, and juxtapose the others.  It creates complexity, where I would label something else randomness.\n\nYour lonely sojourns on the planet's surface are quiet, somber, and low on action.  It gives the player a break from the intensity of the platforming and RPG combat while also giving us a stark "real" world to stand against the fantastic dreamscapes of the Derelicts and the psychedelic fury of the RPG segments.  And "leveling-up" the Derelicts is a matter of earning their trust so they will dedicate more system resources to your task.\n\nGathering free memory in the sub-simulations will allow you to purchase upgrades from vendors you find by exploring the main simulations.   And these upgrades and other power-ups you find are your ticket to success in the menu-driven battles against the virus.  You will need to gather every resource and have a full understanding of all systems to have any hope of success when suing the 1% - err, defeating the late game bosses\n\nUnlike some computer RPGs where combat is a placeholder for action until the boss fights, The Desolate Hope's RPG combat is fixture of strategy and challenge.  You will need to master buffs, debuffs, status effects, running mini-games, storing points, using hack items, and a slew of other systems before taking on the later bosses.\n\nIn fact, this is one of the few complaints I have.  I do love that I'm being challenged, when other titles in the genre often don't.  However, there is so much going on in these RPG segments that are the center pieces of the game and no explanation to guide you through them.  It becomes overwhelming.  I felt like an outsider taking a journey to the depths of superhero fandom message boards: just one incomprehensible wall of text describing powers and systems and the interconnectedness of it all that made me want to back out slowly and cry.\n\nHere's a tip: you won't figure it out for yourself.  Go get a guide.  There's a lovely one in the Steam Community pages.\n\nMy only other criticism is that the game is badly lacking in polish.  It's clear that this is Scott Cawthon's early work and there are some things missing that I expect in a paid release.  The game doesn't adjust itself to suit my native resolation, but rather resets my resolution to make itself fullscreen.  And there's no volume control or pause button.  Pressing escape just instantly closes the entire game.  You get the idea.\n\nStill, I obviously really like The Desolate Hope and would have been almost as enthusiastic if I had paid.  There's nothing game-breaking missing, though it would have been nice to see this one get just a little bit more love before being published.\n\nUltimately, The Desolate Hope is unique, compelling, fun, and free.  So why aren't you playing it?\n\nP.S. If you know or are Scott Cawthon, please tell him I will play Five Nights at Freddy's even though I don't like resource management or jump scares.  But I would like him to make another big sci-fi cluster♥♥♥♥ of whimsical ideas and gameplay.","July 15, 2015","true","9.5"," 44 of 49 people (90%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","90","44","49","10","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/hydris/recommended/298180/","hydris","Hydris","http://steamcommunity.com/id/hydris/","66 products in account","Game is separated into distinct parts where the gameplay is different. There's the platforming to navigate the world,  4-direction top-down shooter in a mini-game to get unlock upgrades, and real-time turn-based hybrid RPG-like combat as boss fights. The platforming and the shooting are simple while the boss fights can pose a challenge and look intimidating, but there's a reasonable learning curve from the first boss to the end of the game.\n\nThere's no restriction or linearity to dictate where and when to progress; so, some trial and error to find which boss is the party as is, is equipped and upgraded enough to handle.\n\nAside from the aspects of gameplay, The Desolate Hope strays a bit from the standard with user interaction. Pausing is bound to unconventional keys (F2 or ALT) [while ESC immediately closes the game]. The manual makes no mention of this; minor-ish issue, but more significant than usual as the game is under a time limit, ticking down in most areas of the game.\n\nMisc.

Though I think the boss fights are very entertaining (but leaning to the same strategy of applying all party buffs and chaining high damage moves), replaying encounters is limited to the two final bosses for a save.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MurcDusen/recommended/298180/","MurcDusen","MagneticJerk","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MurcDusen/","380 products in account","It's kind of a JRPG/Platformer hybrid with metroidvania elements.\nYou control a coffee machine on an outpost on a distant planet that's inhabited by 4 large robots that are supposed to run simulations and figure out ways for colonizing the planet, but a virus is interfering with the project and it's your task to enter each robot's simulation and defeat the virus.\nThe game is split in two sections: Day and night.\nThe main part happens during the day. Here you enter the simulations, which are the platforner/metroidvania segments. You jump around, shoot enemies and collect stuff. You can also enter system panels to close security holes the virus may use. The game then switches to a zelda-ish style with topdown view and each screen representing a room with enemies in it.\nThroughout all this you collect system resources you can spend on various upgrades.\nDuring the night you just go outside the base, walk around the barren surface of the planet and collect items that you can give to the robots which will increase their levels.\nAll that leads up to the battles against the virus, which are semi-turn based battles akin to common JRPGS, but the battle system also has it's own unique twists and turns. These battles are the center of the gameplay, as nearly everything you do is to prepare for them. They can get a bit frustrating towards the end because of some pretty nasty enemy abilities, but overall they are fun and challenging and I didn't need to do any grinding to get through them (not counting the night segments, which are basically just that... plus a little bonus :P)\nThe art and music are amazing, and I really enjoyed the story. The gameplay is fluent, but in itself nothing too special. Basic platforming for the most part, but the JRPG battles really stick out though.\nThe only other thing worth mentioning might be that the game is relatively short. I got through it in 6 hours. I *might* do a second run to get those 200% (only had 168% this time), but there doesn't seem to be any major replayability. So if you want something epic, don't look here. If you want a really nice, atmospheric and uniqe sci-fi short story, get this.","May 7, 2014","true","8.3"," 29 of 31 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","29","31","0","0"

Best way to describeThe Desolate Hope is Megaman/Metroid meets the timed battle system you would find in a JRPG, complete with nice looking pre-rendered backgrounds and characters. Bought the game after seeing it was on sale. Needless to say, it was worth the $1.24 spent on it.\n\nMost of the time, you'll be controlling an autonomous coffee-pot, entering the simulations of AI's in the day, and the surface of a planet at night. Within the simulations, the gameplay centers on the likes similar to Metroid and Megaman, jumping over pits and shooting bad guys. When it comes to fighting bosses however, control switches to the four AI's, switching perspective towards that of a JRPG like Final Fantasy VII. Combat as the AI's at first will seem a bit intimidating at first but once you understand each moves the AI's have, you can try to steer the odds to your end, so as long as you pick the right skills. Levelling up the AI's is also rather simple as the night segments as the coffee pot lets you find certain items to give to the AI's, allowing them to level up as opposed to the grinding you'd find in other RPG's.\n\nThough Scott Cawthon's fame may lie with Five Nights at Freddys, The Desolate Hope is another gem of Cawthon's work, one that is good mixture a platforming, turn-based fights, and artistic design.\n\ntl;dr The Desolate Hope is a gem from Cawthon like FNAF, but instead of evil animatronics, it's platforming, turn-based fights like FFVII, and nice pre-rendered scenery.","November 22, 2014","true","4.9"," 33 of 40 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","33","40","2","0"

I've only played .8 hours at the time that I'm writing this, but from what I've played so far, this game is amazing. Its varied visuals allure the player into the many themes that this game has running through it. The simulation mechanics reminiscient of Inception fit perfectly into the game, allowing it to flow smoothly. The FNAF-like aspects of the game are just enough to make the player think about the game in a deeper sense, rather than making them feel like Scott just copy/pasted a bunch of stuff. The amount of these aspects also prohibits MatPat and nine year olds on reddit from getting in a big screamfest over how the two games exist in the same universe. Cause they don't. (Sorry MatPat, you're still awesome.) The story and diolouge of the game causes you to think, rather than just rushing through it.

It's so weird and yet so compelling and enticing, showing you so much bizaare things and concepts.\n\nThe main reason why I think I like it... it is dripping with athmosphere, showing you a small robutt ecosystem with the simple task of fending of some viruses... and it slowly turns into a desperate struggle against slow, but almost unstoppable decay. It might be just me, but I quickly learned to love the 4 Robutts/Derelects, which are all simulating their own vision of colonizing the planet. They all followed a unique path, which suited them best... but despite being machines, showing a lot of personality, avoking emotions.\n\nMalenz, probably my favourite as the spider rowbutt. Tried his hardest to build a world with very ambitious methods, probably way too much. I think the fight with the viruses and the certain failure of his simulation made him retreat into his own little world... almost like a child with toys. At the beginning nice and friendly, thanking for your efforts to help, even if he doesn't think you will succeed. And slowly becoming more and more depressive... isolative... in the end not even bothering anymore to talk with you... just sad... retreating in a dreamworld to forget about his drawing closer demise... Denial\n\nMirad, dunno about her, but probably the least interresting D: She still very cool. Store supporter in combat, which probably is the most unique way of a role in a RPG like combat system. Always so uncertain about the purpose of life... probably their creators/humans have destroyed themselves and that is the reason they have been abandoned. Even philosphing about people... maybe even machines having spirits. She accepted her upcoming death already and even shows understanding for the viruses actions... maybe its a living thing too that craves something.\n\nAlphus! Hah! He is kinda the big bro... always happy to see you and very talkative. He thanks you for the most neglectable things and takes his mission very serious. He is the only one of the Robutts, that suck to the original purpose of the simulations and created a world, suitable for humans to live in... protected in big biodomes. I think he cares for everything else more than for himself... explaining why he asks you to stop bringing yourself in danger with fighting the viruses... and try to make use of the little time left.\n\nBio Beta... he got so close to finding out what was going on... secretly afraid of death, he tried to escape his form of an now immoblie simulation computer and ascent up to the next level... becoming human? Well... a sentinent being with a real body... either organic or machinistic... but he failed to either transfer functioning intelligence into a new body or creating new... something was always missing. He knows that something was going on behind the scenes, that nothing was as it seemed... asking you to investigate... before his time was running out as well.\n\nThe fact that the game kept me guessing for the story and the twist the entire game was baffling... usually most modern games love to resort to the same old thropes. I guess this one has an standard thrope as well, but I didn't got behind it till short before the end. You get clues here and there, but they could point to multiple possible solutions.\n\nI am merely trying to process my troubled mind in the end... the game left me empty.\nI rarely ever cry from media or games, but this one hit me quite hard.\n\nJust the ending... yeah... not really what I was hoping or expecting... very very unfortunate the game didn't just stop at the words "The End"","June 5, 2014","true","9.9"," 19 of 20 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","19","20","0","0"

Ok, this game has lots of action in it, day/night cycles, and it FEELS like Mega Man, but with more story and RPG elements, and that's what makes it fun for me! It's free as well, so you can also experience this masterpiece that we have here! In this game, you play as a coffee machine, but he plays an important role, and there are four (five?) derelicts that will help you try to destroy and wipe out each and every virus in each simulation. Scott Cawthon may have a lot of popularity just because of FNaF, but I feel that The Desolate Hope is very underrated. Though the bad part about it would be that it doesn't cost money, and I want to support the developer with as much money as he needs, because he made this all by himself, and that gives me hope to know that games can be good, even if developed by one person.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/verticalcleave/recommended/298180/","verticalcleave","landwhale","http://steamcommunity.com/id/verticalcleave/","831 products in account","Essentially two games in one, The Desolate Hope combines familiar gameplay elements from vastly different genres to create something greater than the whole of its parts. While clunky at times, it feels refreshingly creative despite doing little new.\n\nNormal levels play out like a simple sidescrolling platformer where you collect resources and unlock & upgrade abilities. Every map has one boss that you have to beat four times; although it sounds tedious, they mix things up by moving the boss entrance around the map and drastically increasing the difficulty of boss tiers (which essentially forcing you to play through other levels and then backtrack). This helps breaks up the flow and promotes exploration, instead of just steamrolling through the maps one at a time.\n\nThe bosses that you are preparing for during the platforming segments are the crux of the gameplay; it is really refreshing to look forward to a boss battle in a western game. These play out like JRPG battles, with your party of AIs on the right throwing their "spells" at the boss on the left. It took me a while to get used to it because its very fast and click-happy, with bosses often acting faster than your whole party can. Eventually the combat gets so fast that you have to use special abilities to automate certain functions (trying to avoid spoilers here!). Herein lies my biggest complaint because once the combat gets truly challenging and gives you all your tools & toys, the game just plays itself.\n\nWhile I really enjoyed this game, I don't see it getting a sequel anytime soon considering how it ends. Hopefully once the devs are done milking FNAF we will get a spiritual successor because The Desolate Hope is a very creative and colorful take on a futuristic apocalypse.","May 17, 2015","true","7.7"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","88","15","17","6","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Derpadargon/recommended/298180/","Derpadargon","Goyru","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Derpadargon/","199 products in account","I seriously feel sorry for epileptics. Also this game is REALLY hard to get into due to a distinct absence of instructions, so be prepared to learn things the hard way.\n\nThis game is divided into four systems of gameplay. A megaman-style platformer where you manuever your character through a field of enemies that you shoot down with one button, a feverish JRPG with nineteen encounters which you'll probably redo several times as you learn how to fight, a simplistic dungeon crawler where you shoot wireframe enemies with beepy boopy bullets and get cash, and a walk across a serene, pitch-black landscape with a starry sky and a smoldering moon rising in the sky as you look for items to upgrade your party and extend the time you have to complete the game.\n\nOh, did I mention this game is fast?\n\nThe entire game took me eight hours of play, though I don't think I could have completed it without the extra time that was given due to finding power cells in the night. You have but a fortnight to complete your mission of purging the station of the virus that inhabits it. You play as an impromptu antivirus software controlling the body of the coffee machine who's AI awoke you from dormancy, and due to the fact that the act of running a game takes an ungodly number of commands and resources, you overwhelm the virus easily using digital representations of the four robots that act as supercomputers on the space station. The night is when you go out and search for gifts to give them, so that they give you more of their power during battle. Each robot, known as derelicts, has a unique set of skills in battle, and all of them are essential to your survival and success. This is where the main draw of the game comes in. During these short seventeen battles, you will need to use every skill that your team has to bolster your defenses and overwhelm the ♥♥♥♥ out of your enemy until they crumble before your prowess. Combat encounters are modified by contingencies you obtain by completing the dungeon crawler segments; activating commands upon certain conditions in the battle being met such as stunning the enemy whenever points are scored in a minigame that each of the four derelicts can activate, or even having these minigames play themselves when they launch. During the megaman-ish platformer, defeated enemies drop powerups that will contribute stat bonuses during battle as a vital headstart. Pretty much everything you do outside of battle contributes to your party's performance, which is great, and it's actually quite hard to genuinely waste time unless you're idling, due ot the sheer number of upgrades you can find in each mode. Platformer mode is also how you buy upgrades, some of which will contribute to your performance in that mode, as well. These upgrades to your presence in this state are also simple, but I feel they're enough to make you feel like you're still getting somewhere, and getting stronger as you go.\n\nUnfortunately I can't think of a way to talk about the story without giving anything away. It's about a good number of things, pertaining to existencialism and spiritualism, the meaning and sanctity of life. Fortunately, despite the author being christian, I feel that he managed to make his viewpoint independent of religion, barring the ending. And the ending wasn't even bad, I feel it was a logical conclusion to everything that was building up, at the same time managing to still be surprising. Nobody is the villain here, because they all give you their own, valid reasons for how they're doing what they're doing.\n\nI know the way I described the story is vaugue, but if you can't play the game, you could easily find a transcript of what everyone says online.\n\n8/10 you play a coffee pot on an existencial journey through other robot's imaginations.","July 16, 2015","true","1.5"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","0"

A somber tune plays. I'm looking for items. No platforming in this area. Just left and right to move and down to interact with a sparkle on the ground. Suddenly, the game turns into space invaders. Green aliens appear above me and the game prompts me to press "x" to shoot them down. Why? Why here? I don't know. It just happens randomly. I feel like this scenario sums up my experience with The Desolate Hope fairly well.\n\nThe items I'm searching for are given to other robots. Our cause is to destroy a virus that plagues our space station. These robots are extremely intelligent and were designed to simulate human life on this unnamed planet. It makes sense that they each robot fondly collects particular human items given their mission. One hoards clocks, another stashes paintings. They "devote more of their resources to the cause" the more you give them objects they like -- in other words, they level up.\n\nI like games that bewilder me. I like games that are surreal. Why am I a coffeemaker? I don't know why I'm a coffeemaker. With a full coffee pot, at that. Coffee sloshes around in your pot with each step you take. You'd think such a fragile thing would make a poor protagonist in the platformer parts of the game, what with enemies shooting at you, but I guess it's made of reinforced glass.\n\nThere's platforming, RPG battles, and more. Take the ATB system from Final Fantasy games and inject it with steroids. That's exactly what you get during the RPG virus battles. They're probably the most frantic, explosive turn-based battles I've ever played. It's hard to really grasp what's going on at times, but I found myself doing well enough to win most of the time. The game isn't harsh if you fail; it simply kicks you out of the simulation you were battling in.\n\nThe game is somewhat dragged down by the lack of an options menu, long loading times, and choppy gameplay during the RPG bits of the game. The thing that I find most baffling is that the escape key exits the game completely. It's such a standard way to pause computer games that I accidently exited out of the game twice. As far as I can tell, there's no way to pause the game.\n\nDo the game's wildly disparate gameplay types coalesce well? Probably not. But I think the "throw things at a wall and see what sticks" approach works for this particular game. I definitely recommend the game if you want something unique and with good character and environmental design. The platforming aspect of the game is pretty standard, but the rest of it is not.","December 31, 2014","true","10.1"," 13 of 17 people (76%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","76","13","17","4","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/pretentiouswutangratz/recommended/298180/","pretentiouswutangratz","Me","http://steamcommunity.com/id/pretentiouswutangratz/","182 products in account","An odd 2D, or turn-based RPG in an even more odd setting (a science fiction, real world-based one where you fight viruses, in this case), which sees you enter metroidvania type worlds with several stages and a boss at the end of each stage, through a melancholic, sad hub, in order to avert an incoming crisis which will affect you and the other characters. Also, the game doesn't let you save your progress at will, and instead auto saves most actions and forces you to deal with failure. Yes, it does sound like Demon's Souls, and while there are no gameplay similarities, I felt it was worth mentioning how similar the atmosphere and pacing of the game was; the difficulty, too. Even if I didn't consciously acknowledge it at the time thanks to all the differences in gameplay, the atmosphere, pacing and structure of the game are basically identical to Demon's Souls, and that similarity really drew me in, and might draw you in. Anyways, the gameplay is unique, in that there are three sorts of gameplay (and small Zelda 1 dungeon style mini-dungeons); the solemn management and searching of the hub world night time management, when you enter a robot's simulated world, with the ruleset of a metroidvania shooter, and when you enter a boss battle, where you go into a turn-based RPG battle where accumulated, I guess I'd say, 'stat tokens' which you've picked up in the metroidvania gameplay add to the stats of all your characters during the fight. I have to say that the story, pacing, atmosphere and enigmatic nature of the game drew me in at the start, but I think that the game escalates the difficulty carelessly. You get some fast-paced challenging fights early on, but the game quickly makes literally every RPG battle consist entirely of one-shot attacks very quickly, ruining the chance to have a more sensible difficulty curve, and also making some boss fights simply too unforgiving.\nI would have liked this game, but the boss fights feel far too difficult. Seriously, it feels like you have to do things perfectly to win some of the mid-game and late-game fights, and it feels like the sort of design that is only intuitive to the developer.\n\n\nIn conclusion, I really, really wanted to love this game. The bleak atmosphere and story, the spectacular characterisations of the Derelicts (the robots), their virtual worlds, and their fall from grace, the surprisingly great, if odd and idiosyncratic presentation, set in a world where humans have already died out, the combination of several genres, the lack of hand holding, and the very compelling story. I just think that the game's too hard, and personally, I can't say whether I recommend this game or not. I think I recommend it, solely because I want a sequel to the game so badly; just, hopefully next time, the boss fights aren't so ridiculous, and the metroidvania areas slightly more distinguishable and less maze-like.","September 28, 2015","true","2.8"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","82","9","11","2","0"

Sometimes. Okay, a large portion of the game is pretty meh (platforming, mundane fetch quests, and overhead adventure) but the RPG battles... They're absolutely insane. You have your standard buff/debuff/attack/defend/etc but then there's things like minigames you have to play during the battle that help you if you do well, by providing buffs, attacks, etc. On top of that, you can store different moves, such as attacks, heals, revives, and even one that auto-plays the minigames for you for later use upon click. I will say again, the other parts of the game are pretty... meh. They get less painful with upgrades, but the RPG battles are what makes this game memorable. (Also, avoid anything that talks about the meaning of the game until after you beat it if you plan on playing it. It ruined the story a bit for me, but other people may feel differently about it.)","December 29, 2014","true","10.2"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","5","5","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dreebree/recommended/298180/","dreebree","deebee","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dreebree/","399 products in account","Still working on finishing the game at this time of writing this, on the home stretch currently.\n\nThis is a curious little title, with unusual characters, setting, premise, among other things. You play as an AI from a video game system being repurposed for exterminating digital viruses, and you have a physical body on loan from a space station's coffee machine. The stated goal is to purge the viruses springing up in the simulations some of the robots on the planetary outpost/station which other AIs before you have generally failed. To do so, you need to work on numerous layers of your surroundings. As fair warning, this game really doesn't hold your hand, but does give you some room to experiment and learn what it is exactly that you need to do and how.\n\nAs for genre, it's pretty hard to classify this as any single genre as it's a mashup of several, while not feeling particularly broken. There's meatspace (physical space, rather), where it's closest to an adventure title similar to King's Quest, in that you have direct control over a character with limited actions rather than click and point like, say, Monkey Island 1-3. In simulations, it's more of a platformer/shooter, to sum it up. When you get into the source code segments (I don't recall the exact explanation to what these are, though I'm sure the game mentions it somewhere early on) it's more adventure/shooter like the original Legend of Zelda. And when you fight bosses, it's sort of an Active Time Battle RPG but also upwards of 5 or 6 games going on at once, and this is where the game may be completely overwhelming while also being an amazing spectacle.\n\nIt's almost beyond words to describe boss fights, I suppose the closest is what 80s movies predicted games in the 90's to be like? Either way, very unique, in a positive way. Character designs are also wonderful and range from beauty in simplicity to visually overwhelming and I love them all, honestly. The audio is pleasant and mostly appropriate for each area and segment, the game also does a great job of setting up just how grim the situation is without explicitly stating it.\n\nFor criticisms, the game has pacing issues similar to a roller coaster, slow build up before going extremely fast until the bottom of the next hill. As for graphics, very subjective to whether folks will like them, I find em charming personally, but some may not enjoy the mid 90's-style pre-rendered sprites and animations akin to Donkey Kong Country. Difficulty for each part of game is also VERY drastically different, which can cause a little bit of whiplash. I apologize in advance if there is a manual that explains everything somewhere, but there's parts of the game and characters that feel as though there's probably context given in something extraneously, such as in a manual with a little blurb about the character and maybe backstory, but there's quite a few NPCs who seem to just be there with the only context being "Hey, this NPC performs function X or sells Y or sells Z for a small fortune."\n\nOverall, it's a rather unique experience and I'd suggest folks give it a fair shake. I've enjoyed what I've played thus far, and hope others enjoy it as well!","April 26, 2015","true","12.7"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","5","7","0","0"

While nowadays we know Scott Cawthon as the man behind the smash-hit, near pop-culture, Five Nights At Freddy's series one of his first releases was The Desolate Hope.\n\nThe Desolate Hope is a multi-genre game about a space station with only artificial intelligences around. The station was originally planned to house humans but there was never any contact made to say the humans were coming. Years after the expedition was supposed to happen a lone coffee pot robot is in charge of eliminating a virus thats attacking the remaning robots.\n\nTDH is a very extreme game, some things are very good and some things are very bad. The platforming sequences are (for the most part) rather bland and unengaging, the only exciting level would be Betagrid 0.9 but even it suffers from some poor design. Miradmoore is the absolute bottom of the barrel however, being an underwater stage with extremely slow movedment and exploration. This is made worse by the game's world timer, making it very easy to be booted from Miradmoore before you finish what you set out to do. The dungeon crawling segements fare no better, being extremely basic, rather unenjoyable or worthwhile, and feel more like just time wastes.\n\nIn contrast, the JRPG boss battles soar high above the other gameplay faults. The combat system in the JRPG segments is extremely innovate as it contextualizes the use of keyboard and mouse, not only that but it's frantic and fast paced with some of the game's very best music.\n\nThe real king of the game is the graphical presentation, Scott Cawthon has a unique, if not signature, design to his games and its originality is breathtaking. Even the most basic of worthless enemies have such a flair of animation that it comes off as a wholely different type of video game experience. Sadly there are some graphical misteps along the way.\n\nThe Desolate Hope does not get everything right. It's story could use a little more fleshing out, perhaps a bit more explination of some of the item shops, and maybe a bit better design of some gameplay segments. But when the game is good the game is golden, shining far past it's sometimes below-average moments and offering a very memorable experience.\n\nPros:\n- Some of the most wonderful graphics you'll see\n- JRPG battles are innovative and amazing\n- Fun cast of characters with a pretty good story attached\n- Otherworldly atmosphere\n\nCons:\n- Platforming and Dungeon Crawling segments are below average\n- Some graphical missteps along the way\n- Occasional poor level design\n- Can be quite a sporadic game at times, your milage may vary\n\nFor a more in-depth look at The Desolate Hope, please watch my video review linked above.\n\n- Mr. u Suk","July 5, 2015","true","9.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

So I fumbled around pressing all sorts of buttons just trying to advance dialog. There is not a settings menu to show you, nor does the game explain it.\n\nLeft and Right Arrow keys to move, and Down arrow to advance dialog or interact with things.\nZ and X control jumping and shooting.\n\nThe game is glitchy, and I've been stuck in blocks I had to "jump" out of.\n\nThere are no explanations on the various "powerups" and what they do, or what selecting a different option will do "On- Charge" or some nonsense.\n\nThe underwater simulation is unforgiving and soooooo slow.\n\nNo warning that you have days to complete something, the game just sorta changed into Night Phase for the first time, without me knowing I should be paying attention to time.\n\nVirus battle was weird. Now, That's probably my fault as I didn't go do the battle sim like I was supposed to (still won anyways.)\n\nPros:\nThe game is funny.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/amedeus8/recommended/298180/","amedeus8","Comrade St. Nikolai","http://steamcommunity.com/id/amedeus8/","779 products in account","Before Scott Cawthon had everyone cowering in terror from creepy looking robot things, he had them assisting and being assisted by... creepy looking robot things. In The Desolate Hope, you are a computer program originally designed to run video games. Coffee, a walking, sentient coffee maker, activates you and explains that you are to take over his body and use it to fight off a virus that is attacking the simulations maintained by the other robots of Lun Infinus. Coffee would do so itself, but it's far too busy maintaining things and flagging the viruses for you. And with that, you're off on a very unique adventure.\n\nThere are four working robots running simulations on Lun Infinus, and you will have to enter each one and defeat four viruses within. Do not be afraid. They may look intimidating and even dangerous as you enter their respective chambers, but they're all on your side, and they're all quite friendly. Their simulations, on the other hand, have gotten a little... weird. Originally sent out into space to run these simulations for five years, they've now gone thirty years without contact.\n\nThe gameplay is rather varied. Although much of your time will be spent wandering and shooting. In reality, Coffee's body can't do much more than walk around and pick stuff up. You'll use the real world to walk between the robots' chambers and collect knick-knacks to give to the A.I.s within. Inside of the simulations, the game plays out as a sidescrolling jump-'n'-shoot game. You'll shoot enemies, find secrets, collect eggs which will help you against the virus boss fights, talk to things, and hunt for the viruses. You can find computer screens which will dump you into some sort of sub-simulation, an overhead wander-'n'-shoot game. Here you can collect resource chips (The Desolate Hope's currency) and destroy the rift-looking whatsit that's hidden away in one of the rooms to unlock a new conditional for later. Then you have the virus fights.\n\nThe fights against the viruses are where the game really shines. These are flashy, fast-paced RPG battles. They are turn based, but with an active time system (think PlayStation-era Final Fantasy). Your party consists of the four A.I.s that you've been helping, each of whom has a unique set of skills. Every time one of their menus pops up, you can use one of these skills, or charge. What skills you have access to depends on that A.I.'s level of charge, and keeping them charged is an important part of the fight. The viruses get tougher as you go, and you'll need more tricks up your sleeve to see this game through.\n\nThe A.I.s don't level up with experience. Instead, each trinket you bring back from your nightly expeditions outside will convince one to devote more of its resources to your cause, which is represented by the A.I. leveling up. You can purchase a variety of useful abilities from various robots within the simulations. And then you have those conditionals I mentioned. You can set one of a number of useful actions (healing, for instance) to occur when certain other events (like opening a mini game or getting a combo) occur within battles. The catch is, while you have the entire list of "then"s from the get-go, you have to find and unlock the "if"s yourself.\n\nSo, let's talk quality. The review part of the review.\n\nThe art in this game is really weird, but in a good way. You can tell it was created by the same guy who did 5 Nights at Freddy's. It's the way things are modeled and some of the textures, and it's also some of the weirdness and the robots. There's a giant robot in the background of one of the simulations that reminds me an awful lot of Freddy Fazbear. The way Coffee walks down the hallway of Lun Infinus seems like it probably directly inspired the shot of Foxy hauling ♥♥♥ down the hallway in the first 5NaF. The simulations all have different looks and feels to them. The sub-simulations look completely different from anything else, and the virus battles are flashy and remind me a bit of anime, only without the... y'know, anime. Even wandering outside at night is lovely and mysterious.\n\nA major contributing factor to that lovely mysteriousness is the gorgeous music. I can't give Scott credit with creating it, as he says he bought it all through a website called NEO Sounds. But I can absolutely credit Scott with taking the care and effort to find, purchase, and use the perfect tracks to complement each scene. I have no complaints about the music.\n\nThe story is one that kept me paying attention. The core plot isn't overly complex, but it's presented well and supplemented with backstory and information about the world and A.I.s. As with everything else in this game, the story's got that air of mystery that draws you in.\n\nAs for the gameplay, I like it. The jump and shoot sections aren't exactly Mega Man, but they're not boring and they offer exploration and an engaging way to get from point A to point B. The overhead sections are neat if you're just trying to find the rift thing and destroy it, but if you wind up grinding for resource chips the game becomes pretty boring. Good news is, you don't have to grind. Bad news is, intentionally or not, you're kind of encouraged to. See, the entire game operates on this day/night cycle, and the days and nights go by pretty darn quickly and you only have so many of them. You have plenty of ways to get resource chips as you go about your ordinary business, but the overhead sections are the only place where time doesn't pass (other than dialogue windows, I believe). Add to this the fact that you can buy the ability to earn resource chips even faster in these sections, and you'll probably decide it's easier to just grind for awhile rather than waste time.\n\nThis brings me to the time limit itself. It does add an element of pressure to the game, which is nice. But you'll need to figure things out for yourself, you'll have no idea what order to fight which viruses in, and if you're like me, you might waste a couple days trying to explore simulations which are open to you, but which you can't actually do much in until you have the right items. That said, even if you do wander aimlessly for awhile, you will probably eventually hit a stride where you can take out two or three viruses a day, making up for lost time. I still wound up completing the game like six-ish days ahead of schedule. And I hear you can find items outside which will grant you extra days, once you start cutting it close.\n\nAs I said before, though, the active RPG virus boss battles are where the game truly shines, and they'll be what you're striving for. Not the shooty bits, but the flashy, fast paced (the RPG battles are actually faster paced than the shooting sections, can you believe it?), try-to-even-begin-to-keep-track-of-all-this-♥♥♥♥-at-once-lol sections.\n\nWith the sort of creepy but mostly cool art, the fitting audio, and the sweet battles, I recommend The Desolate Hope. I don't know if it's free forever, but it seems like it probably is. And free is more than generous for a quality game like this.","May 8, 2015","true","9.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","2","2","2","0"

The mission was supposed to last five years, and probes with new research samples arrived regularily. With no warning, the probe cargo changed from research supplies to clocks, toys, paintings, snowglobes and other sentimental junk, they started crashing into the planet instead of landing at the base....then they stopped coming altogether.\n\nIt has been thirty years since the last probe came. The station's power supplies are running low, and a virus is ravaging the AI simulations. You are a simple AI supplanted into a mechanized coffee pot - which was included on an unmanned mission by mistake, but is now the last chassis on the station capable of movement, - and tasked with fixing the disaster by entering each simulation and cleaning out the infection. Things get complicated from here.\n\nThis game is a true hidden gem that meshes together a small adventure overworld, a metroidvania, an Active Time Battle boss rush and several minigames, wrapped in an intriguing premise with interesting characters, catchy 90's-style soundtrack and awe-inspiring prerendered backgrounds. You can play a minigame inside of a boss fight inside of a simulation inside of a game. It's bizarre that it was Five Night at Freddy's that brought Scott Cawthon fame instead of this.\n\nThe game is not perfect, of course. The platforming sections are mediocre, the metroidvania part is a bit repetitive and there is some grinding required to gear up for the final bosses. However, the unique setting, atmosphere, graphics and characters more than make up for it.","December 21, 2014","true","8.4"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","5","8","0","0"

The game feels right at home with DOS classics like Fallout and Space Quest, despite coming out over a decade after those titles.

You play as a coffee machine named Coffee (or rather, a thing in the body of Coffee) in a space station named "Lun Infinus". You enter the rooms in it to find the "Derelicts" (giant robots). In the rooms of them you can also enter a simulation in which they are also present. Simulations are the 2D platformer sections of the game. Each simulation has different goals and upgrades you can buy from the robots.\n\nIn some more hidden sections within these simulations are sub-simulations (a simulation within a simulation). Sub-simulations have wireframe graphics and work similarly to the original The Legend of Zelda (and look kinda like FNaF minigames). You and your rabbit (which only appears here, may I add) go from room to room until some monsters start appearing. Defeating a monster will make a cabbage patch appear which your rabbit then eats and you get some bits for it (bits are the currency of this game). There's also a place to buy upgrades here but I won't go too much into it. The main goal of sub-simulations is actually to unlock conditionals for battles.\n\nSpeaking of battles, they're probably the best part of the game! Within these JRPG-like battles, your creepy Derelicts fight against even creepier viruses. I won't go too much into getting to battles because I don't really want to spoil much. If you want to level up your derelicts for said battles, you'll need to go outside during the night phase when simulations are disabled and find some items they happen to collect.\n\nCONCLUSION: C'mon, it's a free game, why are you still reading this?","August 15, 2015","true","3.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I regard Arcen as one of the few true shining lights, and whilst their attempts are hit and miss, their willingness to try new things makes them a publisher to always be interested in, regardless of what they do.\n\nIn this case the mishmash starts with a simple enough side scrolling platform style game (valley of wind style approach), then evolves into some top down exploration minigames with a sprinkling of shooting, and underscored by utterly over the top JRPG style active time battle boss fights complete with over the top animations and explosions and vivid colours. In between all this as a form of palette cleanser, there's a lovely 3D pre-rendered set of screens forming the backbone of the derelict space ship that your avatar, in this case, a mobile coffee machine (best, protaganonist, ever), tootles around, and during the night phases, you wander over a desolate planetary surface, lit in sillouette form to some wonderfully atmospheric music.\n\nIt's rough around the edges, the graphics are very much "indie", and the entire project feels very arthouse, but in a sense like most Arcen games, that's what gives it the charm. The fact that someone is able to bring so much to the table with limited resources and to show what games -can- be when they stop adhering to the boring AAA norms. It's not a game that will appeal to everyone, and I do recommend you read up on it from other sources, because like games like A.I. War, A valley without wind, or Bionic Dues, it's a game that'll appeal to a niche audience. But to those who it -will- appeal to, this is without doubt an instabuy, and for the price asked, you won't regret a single second of it.","June 2, 2014","true","1.6"," 10 of 19 people (53%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","53","10","19","0","0"

First of all, thne visuals are so overwhelming that you often can not even see the character. Ok, once you played a while you get used to it, but when you start the game, the game graphics looks pretty much the same as the loading screens, so when I first started it, I was waiting for the game to start, until after some time I realized that it already has.\n\nThe controls are also pretty bad. You can't reconfigure, so if you don't have an englisch keyboard layout, you may end up with a pretty weirt control scheme. I'm using a german keyboard, where x and z are exchanged, so playing with that means that I always have to cross over for shooting and jumping. This means that for faster gameplay it would be pretty impossible to play. Only way is to swith to an english keyboard layout.\n\nThe user interface in general is pretty badly done, so you don't have a clue with what objects you can interact and what is just decoration, especially since, most of the time you play with the keyboard, but sometimes there are menus where you have to switch to the mouse. The whole game is controlled with the cursor keys except the menus, which can be only controlled with the mouse, which is quite unintuite in this context, especially as there is no visual clue (again) that the cursor keys wont work here.\n\nGraphics and sounds are good, but as already mentioned, the graphics in particular is so heavily overloaded and colourfull that it's hard to discern your character.\n\nSo all in all, I can't really recommend this game.","November 20, 2015","false","0.5"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","42","5","12","0","0"

Notice how most positive reviews only have about 5 hours of playtime, and how the game's actual length is about 20+ hours.\nYeah, not even the people who like this game could be arsed to finish it. It's a long tedious grind that really outstays its welcome,\nI recommend reading some steam guides in order to get an understanding of how tiresome this game is, if you still find the game compelling after reading about it, go ahead, knock yourself out.","April 22, 2015","false","2.1"," 12 of 46 people (26%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","26","12","46","2","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lintire/recommended/298180/","Lintire","Lintire","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lintire/","194 products in account","The Desolate Hope is a difficult game to both explain and recommend, but I fully recommend it. I only know of The Desolate Hope because of Cawthon's work, Five Nights At Freddy's. I didn't care for that, but I'm sincerely glad that it was made just so I was able to play this fantastic but flawed game.\n\nFlawed is even an understatement, it doesn't have a shortage of problems. The gameplay is split into 4 sections and 3 of them are boring to actively horrible. The levels are short and it takes only a few hours to explore them thoroughly. The game's progression is about grinding for currency to purchase every upgrade in the game - and every upgrade is needed.\n\nGameplay sections in this game are neatly split into the following:\n\n• A ATB (Active Time Battle, think Final Fantasy VII) system used to combat a total of 17 enemies (18 if you count the training dummy)\n• Platforming levels used to navigate each Derelict's simulation and gain access to each of the battles, as well as purchase items from vendors hidden and not\n• Overhead battle arenas that are also hidden in the platforming levels to various degrees, but no less vital\n• A mandatory side-scrolling collection minigame in order to level-up your party members\n\nComing to grips with each section requires experimentation and exploration. Unfortunately the game's own (largely forgiving but still present) time limit works against this, but without experimenting and trying new things constantly you can find yourself going around in circles unable to do jack squat.\n\nThe ATB sections naturally steal the show, despite their relatively small amount of gametime compared to the other sections. There's a fantastic amount of depth, even taken on its own merit -  the buff/debuff based strategy means blitzing your way through the battles just isn't an option, and experimentation is forced to the point where I was coming up with cascading choices the likes of which I hadn't seen since Shin Megami Tensei: Strange Journey.\n\nConstant meter management lends the pressure needed to keep things hype, and the pacing between battles is ramped up perfectly - with the final boss requiring a ridiculous amount of strategy that incorporates everything that you've learned so far (and then some, it's a right ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥). Despite the game giving you every skill from the get-go, the pacing manages to thrive in spite of that, an impressive feat. The combat is just fantastically-designed overall.\n\nThe rest of the gameplay is boring. Even actively bad at points.\n\nPlatforming sections are simple scrolling events. There's no difficult or demanding platforming, no interesting or particularly varied enemy types, the movement itself feels slow and clunky with minimal animations and stop-n-go momentum. Even the upgrades that affect the platforming just alter it so you spend as little time as possible there.\n\nOverhead battle arenas are even worse. There's 3 enemy types, no interesting formations, and the mechanics themselves are horrible. More so if you don't find the hidden vendor. You shoot in the direction you're facing and move at the speed of a snail - it's not twinstick, it's not shmup, and it's not fun.\n\nFinally there's the collection minigame which isn't anything. Moving in the one direction and collecting token items.\n\nIt's difficult to recommend this game because for most of it, you'll be slogging through one of those 3 terrible gameplay modes. You won't be coming to grips with the hectic, insanely indepth ATB system, you won't be admiring the fantastic art direction (which is the best art direction I've seen in an indie game, period), you won't even be stopping to admire the layered plot and the well-defined Derelicts, who make for interesting, distinct and likable characters.\n\nBut if you're even slightly willing to force your way through those slow parts to get to the meaty core of this gem, then I wholeheartedly recommend you buy The Desolate Hope.","December 26, 2014","true","15.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I love platformers, so I quickly took a liking to the first part of the game which is to shoot enemies for colored eggs (which I found out much later give you power ups during boss battles) while dodging or shooting down enemy attacks and passing obstacles.\n\nThen you have to find and fight computer viruses using four different characters than the platformer character, the four characters are the mechs who allow you to enter their simulations. The first boss battle had me raging because the boss just spams attacks rather than takes turns attacking, while at the same time you have to attack back with abilities you can't study up on beforehand. This gives you no chance to figure out a strategy, instead you just have to take a shot in the dark until you figure something out.\n\nYou also have a charge meter to determine when you can attack, and a power bar indicating what attacks you can use.  Also the four colored eggs raise your Attack, Defense, Health, and Speed by an amount based on how full the bar is, VERY helpful during the boss battles.\n\nThe boss has a large charge meter which can be interrupted throughout the battle to prevent major abilities from being used against you, and they are not fun to endure...\n\nAll in all, this is a very well made, very unique game bringing two very different gaming elements together into one very strange, very addictive game.\n\n10/10 in my opinion.","April 29, 2015","true","1.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Aekx/recommended/298180/","Aekx","Aekx","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Aekx/","197 products in account","The Desolate Hope is a game on a timer. You, the game program turned hero then put into a coffee machine (coffee still included) are on a mission to defeat a virus that's been wreaking havoc on a space base populated by 4 giant robots called Derelicts so that they can continue their mission to create a habitat for humanity. You enter into virtual worlds constructed by the Derelicts, root out the virus, and then delete it. You have 2 weeks to do so. Broken into three parts, The Desolate Hope's main draw is the RPG battle segments and Scott's signature "♥♥♥♥♥♥ 90's CGI" look that you'll love or hate. I love it.  The other parts of the game, a platformer and top down shooter, sadly lack the energy or even entertainment of the the battles. They're honestly kind of boring, but are necessary since Battles (They're such a large event in the game that they deserve a capital B) don't give EXP or money. The platforming is slow, isn't particularly challenging, and occurs within small, separate maze-like areas where you travel around and gain upgrades that let you explore further. The different areas are designed differently enough, such as one area being almost entirely vertical, which helps makes exploring a bit less tedious. The top-down shooter is accessed within the platformer, and is used almost exclusively for farming money which is used to purchase upgrades for the RPG segments. There's honestly not much to say about these segments, they're average at best and tedious at worst. The game follows a routine: platforming segment, talk to an NPC in the area, then go find the boss and engage in Battle. This allows the player to fight them whenever they want. Players confident in their ability can jump right in and fight, while others can grind a bit first.\n\nHowever, it's such a wholly unique experience once you're playing the Battles that it's worth playing the game for them. ♥♥♥♥'s flying everywhere, there's a racing minigame in the corner and it's making little squares appear, the music is remarkably unlike anything heard for an RPG about giant robots beating up another giant robot, numbers are popping out of everything, and the enemy just turned into a spring-y toy, only to come back and kill everything with a vaguely defined laser light show with names such as "Intense Intensity". I want to get into the game mechanics more but I feel that the Battles are best when you discover everything on your own, with the confusion you feel mimicking your character's as they slowly figure out how to  utilize the power of the Derelicts, who you control in Battle. The Battle system feels like the (il)logical conclusion to the Active Time Battle system, which is an RPG system where players take their turns, but only when their Turn bar has filled. You need to move as quickly as possible, make snap decisions, and deal with everything the boss can throw at you. It's the most active a player has ever needed to be during a turn based RPG, and it's just incredible at that moment when the entire battle system clicks into place and then you're that guy from The Matrix reading those green screens of gibberish. TDH follows after Shadows of the Colossus and as such the only enemy you'll ever face in a Battle are bosses, which is a double edged sword. It makes every Battle weigh more, since they're so limited, but they're also really fun so you want to keep playing them. If you needed a visual representation of how great the Battles are, this paragraph dedicated to them is more than 50% of this review.\n\nOh yeah there's also night-time segments since the game actually runs on a day-night cycle. Anything I've described up until now can only be done during the day. At night, all you can do is play a training machine for mock Battles, and walk to the left and pick up various items that are extremely useful and play the occasional Space Invaders clone. What the ♥♥♥♥\n\nGame clocks in at around 9-10 hours, possibly more or less depending on your completion. It's short, a wholly unique experience, and only 5 bucks. Maybe Scott'll make a sequel if he's done riding the furry porn market for millions.","March 28, 2015","true","9.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The atmosphere is just stunning, it take you a minute to admire the beautiful atmosphere, a few times I stopped and looked at the art style. The combat system is very unique, a bit confusing at first but you get the hang of it after a few tries and the combat music is so much fun to listen!\n\nHowever this game does have its fair share of problems, however none of them are game breaking. The gameplay may get repetitive, collecting chips at night and finding viruses during the day. Walking is very slow and their is no option to sprint or run a bit faster. There is a lack of tutorials to introduce you to the mechanics, which can leave you wondering for quite a while and asking yourself what on earth you have to do next.\n\nBut, this game is a gem of a game and I congratulate Scott Cawthon for making such a beautiful indie game very different to his widely successful FNAF series, and hopefully this game may be given so more love, care and attention and we get a series just like FNAF fans are getting right now.\n\nThe only thing I am sad to say is that although this game is very good, it is a lost gem piled from Scott Cawthon's other successful game series, which is a real shame :(\n\nRECOMMENDED :)  THEPCGAMER'S BEST GAME IN STEAM LIBRARY!

The gameplay may get repetitive, collecting chips at night and finding viruses during the day. Walking is very slow and their is no option to sprint or run a bit faster. There is a lack of tutorials to introduce you to the mechanics, which can leave you wondering for quite a while and asking yourself what on earth you have to do next.\n\nBut, this game is a gem of a game and I congratulate Scott Cawthon for making such a beautiful indie game very different to his widely successful FNAF series, and hopefully this game may be given so more love, care and attention and we get a series just like FNAF fans are getting right now.\n\nThe only thing I am sad to say is that although this game is very good, it is a lost gem piled from Scott Cawthon's other successful game series, which is a real shame :(\n\nRECOMMENDED :)  THEPCGAMER'S BEST GAME IN STEAM LIBRARY! (What's this? :- Like some games get "Best Game of 2014" or "Best Indie Game", etc... So I have decided to make my own!)","May 9, 2015","true","6.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

CSGOEgg.com","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SuperGamerGMR/","61 products in account","This review is not only going to give you my personal feedback about The Desolate Hope, but is also going to shut up all the people who think that Scott Cawthon is a terrible game developer.\n\nBefore Five Nights at Freddy's, Five Nights 2, FNAF 3, and "The Final Chapter", there was a little splendid title called The Desolate Hope, made by everyone's favorite cryptic, Christian, 3DS Max and Clickteam Fusion 2.5 game dev, Scott Cawthon. ;)\n\nReferences aside, this is a game that everyone should play at least once in their gaming lives, and if not then maybe thrice; especially because this game is FREE! Additionally, if you know someone who hates Scott Cawthon just because of Five Nights at Freddy's, let them try out this indie gem to have them rethink themselves.\n\nGameplay.\nThe best part about this game is hands-down the gameplay. It actually combines three types of gameplay styles; top-view, Zelda-like shooting games; Mega Man style, non-linear platforming side-scrollers; and Turn-based RPGs with a unique blend. The RPG style is what I really want to talk most about. The first two gameplay styles are fairly self-explanatory (that is if you know what I'm saying), but Scott has added a very creative twist on turn-based RPG battles. Unlike traditional RPG battles, attacks come seemingly automatically, meaning that you need to react fast to initiate an action. It's a little hard to explain, but I'll try to proceed. Furthermore, there are nice little "microgames" that play during the battles which provide benefits to your party. I apologize for my poor explanantion, but its quite hard for me to put this into words.\n\nGraphics.\nI personally enjoy the visuals of this game, then again I also personally enjoy mashed potatoes with ketchup. The game's graphics use 3D images as 2D sprites, which in turn give it a strange feeling of playing a 3D game from the early 2000s, while in reality it actually isn't. Now this feeling, this is something that I like, as it practically tickles my spine with nostalgia. GG, Mr. Cawthon.\n\nMusic.\nWhile I'm under the impression that this game's music consists of royalty-free songs, they're still quite catchy and enjoyable. Scott really knows how to direct his music, even if he didn't compose it.\n\nOverall, I reccomend that everyone play this game, especially because it's free and you have nothing to lose. It's a charming and unique title that'll make you enjoy game design and almost wish you could do the same. At least, taht's what it did for me. ;)","November 2, 2015","true","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The grahpic screenshots put into images and animations are what makes this game looks so damn good with no CPU lag.  the game is only about 400 megabytes, definitely empty space on my hard drive used well.\n\n11/10 GET THIS GAME!!!","July 16, 2015","true","5.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game is a mix of platforming and fast-paced RPG, (the game is not both, it just transitions from RPG to platformer) It can be complex at times, but you'll get the hang of it. For a small game it is very fun to play, and very nice to look at. It may not have supreme graphics but the art style is very unique. This game isn't flawless, however; It lacks an options menu, and when you beat a "virus" in-game, the levels start to strain on your eyes with the green static. The game has a decent soundtrack for the platforming sections and the RPG sections. The story isn't really anything special, you're a robot who has to beat up "viruses" to progress. The game can get a tiny bit grindy, but you don't have to get ALL the upgrades to win.\nAll in all, it's a very fun game to play, and worth your time.","May 28, 2015","true","9.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I do have some issue with this game like it would be nice if I could map the buttons to the WASD space and some other button to shoot with, it takes a while to figure out what you're suppose to do and where to go, and the level design has the copy and paste level set pieces issue like in old NES games like Metroid and Zelda1, I'd also would've liked a map system of the levels, but for a game made by one guy it's pretty good. I'd give it a 7.5/10. If you like games such as Metroid, Mega Man, and RPGs, and maybe Abe's Oddworld (Mostly because of the artstyle)?

The night parts are fun at first as well (and the planet in the background looks amazing), but then you get tired of slowly moving left until you find a few things, then having to drag them back to your base and give them to the appropriate machines. Despite the redundancy of the games two key playstyles, it's definitely unique enough to recommend.

It is honestly a shame that it comes out just like other overlooked games that are FUN and UNIQUE and INTERESTING, critics love it, but not many bought it. The boss fights are immersive and difficult, the derelicts fell as though they have personality, its such a great game. Yeah sure, its missing a little polish here and there and the platforming isnt AS mush fun as the boss fights but please support scott by playing this game, so that we might in time get a "desolate hope" sequel","July 17, 2015","true","1.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

As a big FNaF fan (now Scott Cawthon fan) I did the same thing, and I still do occassionally as I'm going through. However, I think it's important to note that this is not FNaF and FNaF has nothing to do with it.\nThe Desolate Hope is an amazing game, and even though it probably will never be as popular as FNaF, I hope that someday Scott can turn out another game similar to this one (assuming that developing games is something he wants to do for a long time). The visuals are amazing, I've actually just set one of the scenes from the game as my wallpaper. The characters are loveable as hell, each having unique and interesting traits. Gameplay is, foor the most part, very fun. Music is well done, fitting to the atmosphere and easily getting into my head for hours (in a good way!). I'm a sucker for this old but beautiful graphic style, and sci-fi settings, so this game is like a little slice of gaming heaven for me. (Also I would die to have a game visually and atmospherically similar to this one, but have it be a hidden object/puzzle game rather than an RPG~)\nMy only complaints with this would have to be some aspects of gameplay. The nights drag on, and are pretty much just a lot of holding down the left arrow key, especially after you've gotten the wrench and have no incentive to care about how efficient you are in your nightly collecting. Another thing I took issue with was the real-time combat with viruses. I often find myself flustered and frustrated, which makes strategizing difficult. Lastly, if you want more upgrades, there's a good chance you'll be grinding in those little terminal worlds for money for quite a while, which I find really annoying.\n\ntl;dr : this game is freaking awesome and beautiful, but the gameplay can be frustrating.","February 9","true","10.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A work of art, both visually and story-wise. This game features some of the best visual work I've ever seen, with a real '90s hyperfuture feel. Gorgeous. Story is subtle and effective, a tale of isolation, helplessness, and the terror of uncertainty. Characters are philosophical and devastatingly tragic, doing a good job of exploring the big question: Why do we even?\n\nI know why I even. To jack up spooky cybertards with the help of my robot pals. In the not-too-distant future.\nGreat fun game, ten out of ten, here's my firstborn.\n\nI was thrown at first by the simplistic gameplay. You derp around on rails to access the main platformer levels and eventually do some goofy top-down goofing. I eventually figured out the roles of these parts of the game: Basically you need to earn FAT STACK$ and buy hella upgrades to have any chance of winning the game, and you gotta do it fast-like before the landlord flips the breaker and things go dead. Yeah.\nBut you're here to fight a virus, and that's the main draw of the game. The battles are intense, complicated, and unforgiving; they're the only serious or difficult parts of the gameplay. You need to derp around the research station to access all the simulated worlds and to level your characters for battle. You need to explore each simulation carefully to find upgrades for your fine robo-dudesmen to use in battle, and to actually locate and challenge the manifestations of the Virus to initiate battle. You gotta enter the source-code world to get sweet conditional buffs for your battles. You gotta GIT GUD to beat the living hell out of robotic cyber-nightmares. IN BATTLES.\n\nFound a little glowing fireball? Activate it. Pull up your big boy pants.\n...\nAnd yes, you have to fight THAT. No, don't slam the escape key. Not that you can beat it first time. Haha, no.\nYou gotta GIT GUD.\n\nIt's time to micromanage four different characters with different move sets JRPG style, but *in real time*, trying to out-murder a terrifying robo-devil of some description while he is continuously jacking up yo boys with MIND LIGHTNING. Like a good frantic multitask in the morning? The final moves of each of your characters start little minigames *to be played at the same time* on top of the main battle in order to get some powerups. All this, and the virus is no sissy either. The difficulty ramps steeply, and the game is unforgiving if you are too slow or waste a move.\n\nFortunately, you get a practice arena in which to learn the ropes and PLENTY of fights in which to hone your skills. And failing a fight only sets you back in time- no resources are permanently used up, and you can try again. It's a good implimentation of super-crazy death challenges.\n\nIt's astoundingly addictive. Loads of fun.\n\nP.S. I note how most other reviews have either fewer than 3 or more than 10 hours of play. I reckon a first-time playthrough would take ~9 hours, so there's how you tell if somebody actually finished the thing. I definitely took a full hour to get familiar with the game, but then I was hooked good and firmly.\nThe ending is delightfully bittersweet. I hope you enjoy the heartfeels.\n\nP.P.S. Malentz is my favorite character. His outlook on life is eerily similar to my approach to College. I like how he's the biggest, spikiest, spidery-est robot, but collects toys and spends his time tinkering in his Farmville-style hermitage. He's also got the best moves, though there's competition from that big loveable teddy bear Alphon.","March 21","true","11.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SexyDemonGoat/recommended/298180/","SexyDemonGoat","Baphomet","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SexyDemonGoat/","314 products in account","Coffee saves the day in this bizarre RPG-sidescroller hybrid, The Desolate Hope. In it, you play a small video game program tasked with exploring several unique worlds and battling viruses within as per the orders of a coffee machine tasked with maintaining the extra-planetary colony of Lum Infinis. To aid you on your quest, you have the help of four derelict robots each running their own simulation for you to explore.\n\nGameplay is split between a megaman-style sidescrolling jump and shoot, a top down shooter where you explore cyberspace within cyberspace, and RPG-style 4 on 1 battles vs bosses. TDH features a really bizarre artstyle that I can only describe as “uniquely Scott Cawthon” and if you’ve played any of his other games (especially FNAF) you’ll see why. Another interesting feature of this game are the day-night cycles. During the night, you are relegated to exploring the surface world to scavenge for items to improve the derelicts, increase power to the station, or score a few extra credits playing a space invaders style mini-game. Daytime is considerably more busy, requiring you to dive into simulations powered by each derelict in order to seek out and destroy the viruses located within. Once you encounter a virus, you are thrust into a high speed active-time RPG battle where quick thinking and careful planning are required in order to survive.\n\nOn that note I have to say that, while most of the game was a fairly interesting experience, the boss battles are incredibly confusing and I managed to clear each one without really understanding what was going on. There is just so much happening on the screen in any given moment and the bosses will interrupt everything very frequently to do a full-screen attack. In any case I won, but I have no idea how or why.\n\nChaotic boss battles aside, I still really enjoyed The Desolate Hope and you probably will too if you like eccentric hybrid RPGs. Plus, it’s FREE (can’t beat that!)","December 2, 2015","true","7.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
