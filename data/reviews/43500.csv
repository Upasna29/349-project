"http://steamcommunity.com/id/antwog/recommended/43500/","antwog","Antwog","http://steamcommunity.com/id/antwog/","192 products in account","M.U.D. TV is an economic simulation game develped by Realmforge Studios and published by Kalypso Media. You play as the owner of a custom television network that is in competition with several other networks on viewership. Your network must beat the other network's using quality programs, which appeal to eight diverse fanbases, and gain higher advertising revenue. This game is an absolute buggy mess, but, I immensely enjoyed it.\n\nThe campaign is an interesting concept. The campaign is very specific that you complete missions that work towards your higher objective. Alternatively, the campaign allows for a slow build to a bigger climax. For instance, you have to earn a million viewers within one week in order to beat another network, which will advance the story. The campaign has cutscenes at the beginning that uses excellent comicbook-esque artwork that is simple and nice. The campaign has the potential to be excellent on paper, but the execution fails miserably. I will expand on why it fails miserably in the issues paragraph below, but, the main issue with the campaign is that it is too difficult. Many members on the forums could not pass level 3, even if they followed a guide. I personally could not pass level four, due to the sheer difficulty. While challenge is a good thing, this is frustrating rather than challenging. While I commend the potential exciting story in the campaign, the majority of players likely gave up on the campaign due to the difficulty rather than try to complete it, which I know I did.\n\nThe gameplay is phenomenal. I love these sort of economic simulation games, especially in a television network so I loved playing this game. The process of the game is you buy shows or movies and you add them to your daily network schedule. You buy advertising contracts that match to the shows you air and your network competes with others and the higher viewership generates higher revenues. You can hire a team to make TV shows through an elegant process through the writing team, production team and the post-processing team. Making shows or movies take longer, but have higher quality that potentially can garner higher viewership. The research area is an important tool that assists your network in having more outreach to audiences or even producing quality shows swiftly. The rooms in this game nicely complement other processes, for instance, research and producing a tv show, with the overarching objective to gain viewership. The artwork in this game is neat and bold and fits into the light-hearted tone of the game. I do commend the developers for incorporating satire and humour into the game, as I felt it fit in with the context of the artwork and game style. Like I said, I loved this, as I found competing with other networks to be extremely fun, even if it was unbalanced in how fast a network can buy quality shows. The gameplay was the highlight of the game for me.\n\nThe soundtrack is decent. It has some catchy songs, but nothing to write home about.\n\nHowever, the game's negatives destroyed professional reviewers ratings and my rating. This game, quite frankly, is a buggy and glitchy mess. The developers released seven patches that improved the game and balanced it, but the overall game is unbalanced in the TV side of things but also on the performence side. There were occasional crashes, but the lack of support from the developers hurt this game. For instance, I assume due to under-performence in sales, the developers and publishers gave up any support they had on the game within three months. A quick three months. When they gave up support, they turned off the multiplayer servers, which I unfortunately could not play, and they left the game in a horrible state. The only real decent mode to play this game is customs mode, as its the only mode where players can play and have fun and not just uninstall the game.\n\nOverall, if you are heavily into economic simulation games and are interested in this, by all means, buy it at full price and test the game out. You can get up to about 100 hours with the difficult campaign and the very fun custom mode. In contrast, if you are interested in this and unsure due to the bad publicity, I would not recommend it. The majority likely fit into this category, so I would have to not recommend the game. While the campaign has potential, the artwork and soundtrack are neat and the gameplay is phenomenal, the negatives tremendously hurt this game. The game has limited replayability because there is only a custom mode, where you can grasp the full experience, as the campaign is disappointing in its current state and the MP servers are off. This game had massive potential. But, I still enjoy it.\n\nScorecard:\nCampaign: 3.5/10\nGameplay: 9.5/10\nSound: 5/10\nEnormous amount of issues.\nOverall: 5.25/10\n\n----\n\nThanks for reading my review!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sowelu/recommended/43500/","Sowelu","Traveller (Sowelu)","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sowelu/","333 products in account","Interesting attempt at a Hospital Tycoon genre game.  MUD TV gives the player an avatar, and makes them run around between rooms if they want to do things.  In the real world, it means your attention isn't focused where you wish it was, and having a good strategy can lose to poor base-building organization.  All in all this is what hurts the game most of all to me: In other games I can dwell on one window as much as I want while I'm doing other tasks.  Here, if one thing needs my constant attention, it stops me from doing anything else until I'm done.\n\nActor-wrangling has a pretty fun stat system, absolutely every person is interchangable in every role from acting to directing to postproduction, but stats that improve performance in some roles are actually a downside in others.  There is no meaningful one-player mode: Your station is always competing with other (usually CPU-controlled) stations for viewers.  Program production isn't *deep*, but it's better designed than a lot of stand-alone "make a movie" games that I've seen.\n\nUnless you are playing as a public-supported station, the funding model is /weird/ to play.  You gain no money directly from airing programs--instead, you buy contracts with advertisers for things like "within 48 hours, run this ad in 8 slots that have at least 2 million geek viewers".  It's a cool idea, but the avatar control means you need to leave your station and run down to the ad station, and then you have to scramble to get the good ads before the other players do.  It also means that making money is very boolean; you either hit your contracts and do well, or you whiff them and get screwed hard.\n\nMUD TV innovates a lot and breaks a lot of genre conventions.  If its changes worked, the execution is good enough that it would be genre-defining like Hospital Tycoon.  However its experiments just don't seem to work for me.  If you want a jump-in-and-enjoy genre game, maybe look elsewhere.  If you're willing to experiment a lot, and explore the edges of the genre, give it a shot.","March 15, 2014","false","17.0"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","11","16","0","0"

It's Mud.\n\nM.U.D. TV has a great idea that is so crash-happy, boring, and convoluted that I don't recommend this for anyone\n\nWhen you get it started, you begin with a small space on a random floor of an office building that can be expanded, to an extent, by building more rooms for different purposes, like a sound stage. You also have to hire the right people to get the job done. After that it just falls apart. You cannot spend too long on one item because the game won't pause while you're viewing screens. You can train people, but it becomes easier, but more expensive, to fire them and hire more competent people rather than wait for the original's training to complete. And God help you if you've built up your studio floor in a way that can't fit everything you want. It would have made more sense for everything to be in a pre-build layout and pay to have rooms unlocked/built.\n\nThe set-up isn't intuitive, making it heard to learn how to play... or even learn what the goal is.\n\nHard to learn.

Is it the best game around?  Of course not, but on a Steam sale for less than $5, I've certainly got more than my money's worth on this one.\n\nWhile it seems complex at first, those who are familiar with tycoon and business simulations will find it surprisingly easy to understand.  It has not so much a learning curve as a sharp hump at the start but it's all smooth sailing from there.  It can get very challenging, especially when trying to manage multiple shows at once, along with staff, advertising contracts, budget, and so forth - but with greater challenge comes a greater sense of victory from overcoming them.\n\nThe graphics are cheesy and dated, but if you're more into content than glitz, this is actually a fairly decent game at a shovelware price.  Having been burned on some $50+ titles that left me with nothing but regrets, I'd say this game is a pretty good value for it's price.\n\nAlso I've heard a lot about crashing but frankly I just don't see the problem.  I've only had it crash once, and that might have been my own fault (luckily it autosaves).  It's certainly more stable than anything Bethesda has released in the last decade, and system requirements are low enough to fit on your average modern cell phone (note: you can't actually do that, I'm just making a point).\n\nAll in all you're looking at about a 2.5 to 3 star game at a 1 star game price.  The customization is a nice bonus.  My only real complaint is that the pdf manual included only seems to come in German.  Luckily it only takes about ten seconds on Google to download the English version.","March 17, 2014","true","36.1"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

The pairing of groups who are interested in romantic or singing content is unexpected.  Some of the titles of the shows may cause a wry smile, but there remains a certain amount of inflexibility in the game which could quite easily make a player throw the keyboard out the window or at the screen when what should have worked does not work.\n\nThis game is recommended but be aware of the frustation and the tutorial's complete lack of assistance.  There is a very good guide which will help you through the first few levels on the Steam community, but aside from that, there is a dearth of help available.","December 12, 2014","true","212.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You decide the programing, select advertisers, and even produce shows. The game tries to be a spiritual sucessor to the 1999 classic MAD TV, just without its addictive nature or its fun.\n\nFailed Humor\nMUD TV tries extremly hard to be funny, and you can tell the develpers thought they were hilarious. However all this humor falls flat. The descriptions of the different veiwership groups come off as stereotyped rather than funny, the discriptions of different TV shows comes off as Cynical rather than clever, and the story of a Mad scientest trying to take over the world through television sounds like it was written by a third grader.\n\nGameplay\nHowever the humor and story would not matter if the gameplay was good. Sadly it is not. Gameplay centers around either filiming or buying TV shows and stragically adding them to the schedule. That is about it. Espionage and resarch form very minor parts of the gameplay. They system for producing show is incredibly simple and it is very easy to regularly produce five star productions. The gameplay just feels repetitive and boring. The competition aspect almost does not matter and unlike many other tycoon games, nothing will come up to stand in your way. There is no challenge so the game becomes somewhat boring.\n\nHOWEVER,this game is strangly addicting despite it's bad qualities. It can be an interesting puzzle to fit the shows into your schedule, and the game, though repetitive can be fun for hours. In reality, if I could give this a rating of neither yes or no but somewhere in between I would, becuase I was actually pulled in and enjoyed the game, but that may simply be becuase I have not spent much time with it If you are interested try to find the demo online, and see if this apeals to you. Also keep in mind that a similar game is being relased on the 20th of October 2015, called Empire TV Tycoon which looks very promising. I would recomend you consider that before you purchase MUD TV\n\n6/10\n*Note: I have spent another 5 hours or so playing the demo, which is very similar to the actual game.","October 4, 2015","false","8.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

One of the few reasons I recommend the game is because it gives you what it promises. I didn't go into this game expecting too much and it honestly doesn't have any replayablitiy at all but the few hours of play time you do get before finishing the game seem to past by without too much trouble. Never really got tired with the game before I finished it so thats a plus considering how small the game is.\n\nIf you are looking for a game that lets you run a T.V. channel and setup the broadcasting then this game will be what you want though as I said the game itself is not very complex and it doesnt have much in the way of replayablitiy which is sad because the gameplay wasnt all that bad. Just not much of a reason to replay it. The whole point of the game is just to try and score better ratings then before.","September 1, 2013","true","3.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
