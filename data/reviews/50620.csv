Darksiders drops you into a post apocalyptic nightmare of a world that is an amazingly organic blend of Heaven, Hell, and the modern world. The game contains many beautifully designed levels that have you running down city streets one moment, and fighting in a Hell spawned cesspool the next, with one flowing beautifully into the other. Character and monster design leave nothing to be desired either, with wonderfully detailed nightmares and angelic warriors coming at you from all sides. This game definitely has the eye candy taken care of.\n\nAs far as the mechanics go, as I said, think God of War and you've pretty well got the idea. You're going to collect souls in order to level up. You'll learn new skills, get new toys, and those toys will need to be leveled as well. You'll run around unique, artistic maps solving complex puzzles. Combat is largely combo based versus multiple opponents, with multiple weapons to choose from. One of the amusing additions to combat is the ability to use just about anything in the environment as an improvised weapon. Street signs, street lamps, cars, you can use them all as either projectiles or beating implements. When the boss fights come up, you'll be working to beat them down to a context specific cut scene finale. If you enjoyed the GoW's gameplay style, you'll feel right at home here. And honestly, there is something to be said for that. The familiar mechanics mean that there's no time wasted figuring out how the game works, and more time spent actually playing the game.\n\nDarksiders can be challenging at times, particularly some of the boss battles but the best advice as always is to persevere and you will find the solution. If you can overcome those minor issues then Darksiders has much to offer with a good storyline, many hours of gameplay, and some of the best action sequences you are likely to see.\n\nThough influences from other games are clear to see, Darksiders still manages to excel on its own merits. If you're looking for an action/adventure that will keep you busy for hours then there is no need to look further.","December 18, 2013","true","23.6"," 197 of 221 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","197","221","0","6"

Still to this day I am stunned at how amazing and underrated this game is. Darksiders can be called many things; most idiots, in fact, will call it a "God of War rip-off", a "Zelda rip-off" and so much else that no one bothers to call Darksiders... well... "Darksiders", even though the game has its uniqueness.  It's like calling Crackdown or Prototype a GTA clone!\nIt has similarities to Zelda and if you're going to take ideas (not rip-off, people! Jeez!) from some franchises, Zelda is certainly one of the best to start with.\n\nAlright let's get TL;DR out of the way for you lazy dudes out there ;)\n\nTL;DR\nDarksiders is a Third-Person Character action game that everyone should play.\n\nPROS\n+ Excellent variety in the locations and enemies;\n+ Interesting story with very good atmosphere and lore;\n+ Simple (though not easy) but entertaining combat;\n+ Metroidvania elements  (some may not like this, though)\n+ Very lengthy and decently paced (according to steam, took me about 25-27 hours to finish);\n+ Hard but satisfying puzzles and platforming elements;\n+ Open World that doesn't feel empty (there always something interesting every corner);\n+ Appealing art-style.\n\nCONS\n- Game has pacing issues by the end;\n- Last boss fight, in my opinion, was ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t;\n- VERY Barebones PC Port (will enter in detail below);\n- The achievements of this game are bugged and have never been fixed.\n\nDETAILED REVIEW\nSTORY\nApocalypse is rising, Heaven and Hell are fighting and mankind's totally f*cked in the middle.\n\nAlso in the middle is YOU: War, one of the 4 mythical horsemen of the apocalypse. You get unfairly accused of screwing up and thus, it's your mission to get into an amazing adventure and fix all this ♥♥♥♥.\n\nThe story is fun to follow through and serves as a nice reason for you to get into the varied locations you're going to get into.\n\nGRAPHICS / PC PORT\nOne issue will sit in this particular section: the PC Port.\n\nNow... it doesn't run bad! In fact, even my old trusty toaster can run this game! I didn't try to put the disc in the toaster's slot, but I'm pretty sure the game runs well there... and I can eat delicious toasts with butter while playing :)\n\nAnyway, the game runs well BUT! There are no graphical options! Well there are some... a whoopingly high amount of video options of...  3: V-Sync, Gamma and Resolution\nYeah... moving along.\n\nGAMEPLAY\nBasically what makes Darksiders so good is the gameplay. It's very varied.\n\nSure, you start with a very basic combat focused game with few to no combos at all. But like any game, the gameplay becomes harder and more varied. You'll get a leash to grab high ledges, a powerful Power-Fist sort of gauntlet, a scythe, a portal gun (lmao), etc. This will add depth to the combat AND will add its own puzzles and platforming sections.\n\nThe puzzles made tear my hair out by the end. Then again, I'm not a very good puzzle game player, though I love puzzle games.\n\nYou'll also learn new moves/combos with each weapon.\n\nWith every new object you get, you'll be able to unlock new areas and even in old areas, you will be granted access to some valuable secrets to help you on your journey, if you care enough to go back, that is... This is where the metroidvania elements come into play.\n\nThere are also a lot of collectibles which are worth your time searching for.  It's not just a gimmick like in Call of Duty :p\n\nAUDIO\nI. ♥♥♥♥ing. Love. The ♥♥♥♥. Out of this soundtrack!\n\nMoving on: the voice acting. It's actually very well done. Voices are either hell-ish or those Gruff McGrufferson type of voices, but they work in the context of the game. Nothing's too cringe-worthy to make me lose interest in the story.\n\nThe combat is also good thanks to the great sound assets of the weapons and the enemies.\n\nCONTROLS\nThe controls for a character action game usually prefer the controller (a game I've been playing recently that applies well to this rule is Alice: Madness Returns), however, I played through the entirety of Darksiders (1 and 2) with the Mouse and Keyboard and I must say he controls are so well done, responsive and properly placed that I had no issues with them. Absolutely no desire to go to a controller.\n\nIt's sad because the controls are obviously well PC designed but then the graphical options department is almost non-existant.\n\nOVERALL\nOne hell of a game!  (Pun not intended)\n\nSeriously, I had no moment where I felt bored. just when every location started feeling dull, a new one TOTALLY different appeared and the game kept doing this over and over. No location felt overdone and this allowed the game to not outstay its welcome.\n\nAnd since nowadays a review can't be taken seriously without a score that abstractly sums story, graphics, audio, gameplay etc. into a number that represents absolutely nothing useful for the consumer, I will rate Darksiders a WorthBuying/10.\nOh... right, the score must be pointlessly idiotic, almost forgot :p\n\n9/10. Anything below 30€ will get your money's worth. The game goes regularly on sale and reached the "Under 5€" mark so, with a bit of patience, you can grab this game dirt cheap; almost like stealing.\n\nSHOULD BE ILLEGAL TO STEAL SUCH MASTERPIECES! :p","September 5, 2015","true","28.9"," 103 of 120 people (86%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","86","103","120","15","20"

These are not just rocks, but the actual armies of Heaven and Hell, ready to fight each other in an epic battle. Mid in the fight, another man falls from the sky: The Apocalyptic Horseman War. He does not fight for any side in the battle, he is just there to keep the balance, but there is one problem. The Horsemen are only allowed to interfere when the 7 seals are broken. And nobody broke them. War gets teleported to the fiery council, who go into court with him because he broke this rule.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=274593426\nHe tells them that he has gone to earth because he thought the seals were broken. The fiery council gives him another chance to get rid of his guilt, by killing The Destroyer, the one who started the battle between heaven and hell. So War gets sent back to earth, 100 years after the apocalypse.\n\nThe gameplay is a typical Hack'n'Slay. War is badassily strong and gets to fight against a lot of enemies at once.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=274593415\nHis sword swings hit many enemies at once, and there are other weapons to be aquired with other abilities. The battles feel good and fluid, the finisher moves are brutal and the blocking/evading works great.\nBut there is more than just fighting. The game provides levels and riddles that make it feel like the result of hot sex between God of War and The Legend of Zelda. The riddles can get really hard at times, but not frustratingly hard, so the game does not get boring.\nThere are a lot of collectibles in the open world, and they also help War, like the Abyssal Armor. There are 10 pieces to find, that are pretty well hidden. If you find all pieces, you get one badass armor.\nSadly, the programming is weak at times and lets the game crash from time to time. There are also some bugs, like falling through the ground (happened to me 4 times). Good thing that there are enough checkpoints to make up for such annoying bugs.\n\nThe grafics like a bit comic-like. The characters look extremely packed with muscles,\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=274593438\nblood squirts en masse, the bosses are huge and monstrous. The environment is very variable, from the destroyed remains of New York over a forest to a huge desert. The light effects look great and the textures are detailed.\n\nHuge, aggressive sounds of orchestral rage are violating your ears in this game. The music fits extremely good with a game where you play as The Apocalyptic Horseman War himself.","April 20, 2015","true","22.3"," 66 of 72 people (92%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","92","66","72","4","3"

First of all, there aren't many good slasher games on PC, thus this one is already worth buying it. The graphics is not next gen as it was port from the consoles, but the game still looks nice due to wonderful level designs and pretty character models. The story itself is very interesting to follow, plus there are some collectibles to find - thus  the full game completion will take some 20 hours.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/grimwold/recommended/50620/","grimwold","Grimwold","http://steamcommunity.com/id/grimwold/","566 products in account","I'd started playing this game on several occasions... the first time the game chewed me up and spit me out before the end of the first dungeon... the second time I reached the first Boss, took a hammering a few times and then took a long break... but the story and the gameplay really intruiged me, so I came back a third time and was able to stay the course this time. Despite my earlier misgivings, I had an absolute blast and thoroughly enjoyed playing Darksiders... a few people have said it is an underappreciated game, and I can understand that.\n\nThe player takes on the role of War, one of the 4 horsemen of the Apocalypse, who has been summoned to earth under the impression that the Apocalypse has begun, but when he arrives he finds that the 7 seals required to summon the horsemen are intact, and that his 3 companions have not been called... moreover the demons and angels have wiped out man and continue to fight in the remains of the Shattered Earth. War is accused of breaking the law and siding with Demons, so he sets out to clear his name.\n\nAs a Christian, with an interest in endtimes fiction, I personally found the over-arcing story to be very interesting... though I can see that the in-game story could have been so much better than it actually was, perhaps down to publisher's decisions.\n\nThe game is most often compared to Legend of Zelda, and God of War (with a touch of portal thrown in too)... Having never played either LoZ or GoW I did not find the game to be derivative, except for the portal elements, so that colours my opinion of it. I did find combat to be frustrating at times, and it was this that initially put me off... but restarting a couple of times gave me the chance to become more familiar with the enemies and more experienced at fighting them. There is quite a significant degree of button mashing, but no amount of hammering on the same keys will keep you alive unless you learn to survive against some of the nastier enemies.\n\nThe game does have some of the best boss and mini-boss battles of any game I have played, with particular favourites being: The Jailer; The Griever; An Ashworm; The Stygian; The Broodmother and The Destroyer, to name a few.\n\n\nOn the down side there is a lot to get through between boss battles... with travelling through areas between the main hub and the dungeon, then completing the relevant dungeon including numerous tough enemies and a few nosses (not bosses) and mini-bosses... to finally face the dungeon's boss. Also, the dungeons themselves are linear, the puzzles are usually spelled out for you by means of an introductory cut-scene (which I'm used to from the tombs in Assassin's Creed 2), and they were almost always solvable using the piece of equipment or special skill that you'd just acquired... furthermore you'd often acquire something in the dungeon that would then be the key to fighting the boss. I've played and enjoyed a lot of linear games, so I really don't mind that so much.\n\nThe voice acting is a bit of a mixture... Mark Hamill is brilliant in the supporting role as The Watcher (simultaneously holding War's leash, and acting as an in-game hint system), while some of the other cast were not as great... a few people have commented that the actor voicing War was especially bad, though I never found him to be quite so... I guess I just accepted War's personality as his portrayal and I certainly never felt his delivery jar me from the game.\n\nAnother particular highlight for me was when War was able to summon Ruin, his horse, and the couple of big fights that followed... some brilliantly epic gaming in my opinion.\n","November 26, 2013","true","40.3"," 66 of 76 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","66","76","0","0"

I don't know.\nMany reviewers describe this game as God Of War clone. Even if it's true, I see nothing wrong with that. On that point, are all the shooters clones? Are all games sharing same gameplay mechanics clones? I mean, yeah, it have similar gameplay at it's core, but in my opinion, it's more correct to put this game in that particular subgenre of hack 'n' slash-action-adventures, rather to call it clone.\n\nSo what is that game about.\nYou can find about the plot in wikipedia or something. In that type of games, the plot plays secondary role (atleast for me). What I want from that type of game is good, solid gameplay. And Darksiders have it. The game's story is decent enough to keeps you playing and thats more than enough for me.\nThe short version: you play as WAR - one of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, summoned to restore THE balance between the good and evil.\nFor the most of the time, you hack, slash, climb, pull, shoot, solve puzzles, open chests, fight bosses...What more do you need?\n\nThe gameplay is solid and polished. The combat and platforming feels and plays fluid. I've had some difficulties with the shooting, but nothing gamebraking. The puzzles are challenging, but not too hard.\n\nThe art is comic-styled with the typical hyperbolized models of the characters, armors and weapons, which makes the world of Darksiders epic and badass.\nThere are some RPG elements, but nothing special. Collect souls, buy upgrades, movements, gear, etc. The score and voice acting are on decent level, but fits well and helps the game to feel even more epic.\n\nSo if you love God Of War, Dante's Inferno, Devil May Cry, Prince Of Persia, Legacy of Kain, you will love that one too. It plays right, feels right, looks right, it's a good, solid and polished game.\n\nAnd FFS, people, PLAY IT WITH GAMEPAD! I can't imagine how can you play that sort of games with keyboard and mouse! You will hardly enjoy the game without a proper controller. It's designed to play that way. Some people call it bad port, i call it bad peripheral choice.\nI've played it on Xbox360 and it plays the same. So nope, not a bad port at all.\nHad some problems with my Logitech Rumble Pad controler though, but putting x360ce make it work like charm.\n\n8.5/10","December 9, 2013","true","13.1"," 59 of 67 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","59","67","0","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/miyumiayase/recommended/50620/","miyumiayase","Miyumi Ayase","http://steamcommunity.com/id/miyumiayase/","288 products in account","INTRODUCTION:\nI got Darksiders because I was interested on the rather unique theme. Once I started playing it, I quickly found myself being oddly familiar, despite being my first playthrough. Then it dawned on me, the game played like other more popular Action Adventure titles such as, but not limited to: God of War, DMC, Zelda, Prince of Persia, Portal etc. At first I was skeptical about the similarities but still found Darksiders to be a fun game in it's own right.\n\nWar, one of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse has landed on Earth triggering a full scale conflict between Heaven and Hell which utterly disrupted the precious Balance that dominantly prevailed for eons. Hated by Hell, condemned by Heaven, War now walks the Earth in an attempt to clear his name.\n\nPROS:\n+ Familiar but still Fun Gameplay: -Taking multiple inspirations from other titles, Darksiders takes the best of the best features and aspects of those titles and mashes them up to make a Frankenstein monster type of game which is unique unto itself. This game deserve more attention than what initially got.\n\n+ Atmosphere and Sound: -Sound assets are magnificent, scenery are breathtaking and character art are wonderful built. They all come together to make a very immersive and beautiful post-apocalyptic Earth.\n\n+ Graphics to Framerate Ratio: -Being a copy paste console port, does leave the game a bit weak in terms of graphical fidelity, poor texture quality, weak special effects and limited animations are blatantly visible but it does benefit older and more outdated PCs. The 1080p support does make it more vivid and sharp than the console counter parts.\n\n+ Puzzles: Taking inspiration from the Zelda games, Darksiders does feature a lot of puzzle solving, involving different skill sets and items that the player acquire. The puzzles are simple enough to not be frustrating, yet delivers a certain level of complexity that makes them satisfying to solve.\n\nCONS:\n- Controls: -Being a console port, this game was clearly designed to be played using a gamepad rather than the mouse and keyboard. Attempts were made to integrate it better to Keyboard controls but the player will be left rather frustrated for the most part.\n\n- Limited Graphical settings: -This speaks for itself, the game hardly has any options to change graphical fidelity. If you find yourself using a lower-end PC and FPS drops occur, you probably won't be able to do anything about it.\n\n- Poor Story and No character progression: -War is not the most likable video game personality you will encounter, the story does not develop on the main protagonist either in personality or traits. He will have the same expression and demeanor from start to finish. As the Fallout games say, "War never changes."\n\n- Restrictive maps: -Lets make a checklist on what being a Horseman is all about. 1. Have a horse (albiet a bit late in the game but CHECK) 2. You can fight in said horse (CHECK) 3. You have a place to ride your Horse (NOT CHECK). The game gives you one or two maps where riding Ruin (your horse) viable, but other than those maps, you'll find yourself fighting on foot through small and cramped areas not being able to utilize the glory of mounted combat.\n\nCONCLUSION:\nGOOD GAME, it takes the best mechanics of other games and places them into one and making a very fun and enjoyable experience.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nLike my Reviews?

I orginally played Darksiders on PS3 but didn't complete it. On the PC, it still looks and plays great. It's not perfect but it absolutey fun to play. I've heard it described as Zelda for grown ups and I think it is an apt comparison. In each section you have to obtain a new weapon or tool that will allow you to proceed to the next area or get back to that one spot you couldn't previously reach. It also has some very simlar weapons/tools such as the hookshot, a boomerang, a shadow world over world. There appears to be a fairly deep combo system but I was ok playing a button masher extravaganza and only learining a couple of the combos.\n\nMy only negative, which may not be one for some, would be that it overstayed its welcome by just a bit. By the time I was 26 hours in, I was ready to get to the end of the story (which is still pretty good by the way)\n\nI would defintily still recommend it and I look forward to playing as War in Darksiders 2.

Graphically the game is ok, the sounds that are the highlight with good effects and a great soundtrack, and a flawless voice acting.\n\nThe plot is another strong point, well worked and unique, which involves aspects of Christianity and has great characters. War, one of the 4 horsemen of the apocalypse and the playable character is without a doubt remarkable and captivating.\n\nAlthough the combat gets better on the joystick, there are many parts where you need to aim and I found difficult when I had to be quick, so I started to play on keyboard + mouse. There also a problem with achievements, I noticed in the middle of the game that some don't unblocked. Other than that, I can only recommend!\n\n8/10","March 21, 2014","true","21.0"," 27 of 31 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","27","31","0","1"

With my numerous attempts at writing a decent introduction I found myself thinking about this game much more than I should, considering it is just a dumb, unambitious hack 'n' slash title...\n\nI remembered how this game started a series which never reached completion, as THQ's bankruptcy halted all plans for future entries after the second one. Should we be sad about it? I mulled over all those opinions about War's journey being a calque of successful story of Kratos from God of War. How funny is that? There are so many H'n'S games, GoW did not start them nor was it the best game (/series) of this type. I thought how many people will even read this review, considering that everyone who wanted to own Darksiders already has it, either cursing or celebrating it (or maybe doing simply nothing...?).\n\nOh? I accidentally wrote something akin to an introduction. Sweet!\n\nAt the beginning, I stated that this game is dumb and unambitious. While this is technically true, as the game never overstepped its bounds with its design, there is no reason to label it as "bad". Quite the contrary, you can have a lot of fun tearing apart various opponents, searching for hidden treasures and solving environmental puzzles. Just do not expect any narrative depth or involvement with characters. The story is quite straightforward and the big twist is not quite as shocking as it should be, but nothing can be described as cringeworthy, so that's a plus.\n\nThe combat is enjoyable, especially further in the game when your power grows with every upgrade bought from demon merchant, every weapon added to War's arsenal and every ability found. There is also a decent number of enemy types and bosses to unleash your power on and make 50-or-so combos. Add in some finishers and you should have a satisfying combat system, right? Unfortunately... in practice it falls short sometimes, as it is bit less varied than it could be. You might be a bit disappointed once you realize you can get only 3 melee weapons, 2 ranged and, uh, one horn, for crowd control. The number of possible combinations is really small as well and some of them can be unlocked only after the weapon levels up (yeah, you have to use a weapon to level it up and THEN you buy a new combo or upgrade those you possess). Furthermore, the game does nothing to encourage or award combat variety. You can just stand in one place and spam one technique over and over, you get no points for trying to be stylish. Dodging is also a bit strange, as it seems to be a bit too slow but I suppose it makes sense with War. Just look at some artwork of him!\n\nIn Darksiders if you are not in combat or exploring (which is really nice, by the way - many nooks and crannies to look into and an ok level design) you are probably solving some puzzles. All of them are quite easy, although you might want to pause for a bit and look around before going for the solution, as in many cases you can find treasure chests or precious artifacts in the puzzle areas, saving you a lot of time you would otherwise have to spend to find that one chest with the awesome armour piece you missed. Quite curiously, many elements of Darksiders - especially puzzles - remind me of the Legend of Zelda series. You go to the dungeon, find a new item, proceed through the dungeon with the help of said item and finally fight a boss... which at some point requires your newly acuired item. Simple and sweet.\n\nWhat I am trying to say through this review is that Darksiders is a simple, decent game. While it might not invest you terribly in War's story, it can help you relax and have some good time. Who knows, maybe you'll want more? The sequel is supposed to be even better and it is always good to start at the beginning.","November 21, 2015","true","30.4"," 32 of 40 people (80%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","80","32","40","4","0"

Let me mention only a few, the ones I faced in 15 hours of gameplay:\n- the black screen upon first time launching issue - fixable by deleting files from the game installation (the AMD_Logo_movie.wmv file or the options.dopt file)\n- the steam cloud not working issue - save files have to be manually moved around upon various folders to actually enable the proper use of the "cloud" synchronization feature\n- the game breaking "twilight cathedral" crystal sword bug (a "crystal sword" needed to progress through the game gets missing and you have to completely restart the chapter, unless you have a proper save);\n- Steam achievements that should be unlocked might not get unlocked, for unknown reasons. Very often game saves are a must.\n\nFurthermore, so far, the boss fights are either too easy (the jailer) or damn straight unfair (Tiamat). On the good side, I don't see that much of a difference between Darksiders 2 and 1, visually speaking. The game looks good, the cutscenes are amazing, the design is well-thought. If you loved Darksiders 2, you won't feel like Darksiders 1 is a downgrade.\n\nI loved Darksiders 2 and recommended it with all my heart, but Darksiders 1... hmm... Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed playing it, but I just can't recommend it as it is, without hesitation, with all my heart, in its current form. It's just too flawed.\n\nAt the moment, after all this struggle with bugs and glitches, this game goes to my "recommended with a lot of second thoughts" list.","December 29, 2014","true","25.0"," 22 of 23 people (96%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","96","22","23","5","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/UdyrOP/recommended/50620/","UdyrOP","NemO","http://steamcommunity.com/id/UdyrOP/","142 products in account","After almost 20 hours of continuously playing I'm finally done. This has really been that one game, that has finally revived my hunger for actually playing games. Where to start, you start as a warrior named war (hence the pun :D) fighting against 2 factions, heaven and hell to regain balance. As most people I started by reading some reviews, then I stumbled across this one review which said '' please don't play this game on easy, you'll regret as hell'' so I followed his advice, took normal, now that I'm done I highly regret not playing on apocalyptic (hardest difficulty). So please, don't be as foolish as me and play this game on apocalyptic mode and just enjoy it. Now to some pros and cons\n\nPros:\n- The story is just amazing IMO, you're a horseman, you're one of the 4 horsemen who serve as the law, balance and order between Hell, Heaven and Earth. I really recommend you see all cutscenes and just follow the story and never miss a shot, cause man you'll regret like hell.\n- The voice actors are just amazing, the way they talk, how they talk and just everything, there's always something new to expect in each cutscene.\n- Dialogue is amazing, not just the voice actors.\n- The best way to put the combat is that it's hack and slash, use combos, any kind of combos you desire, buy, explore and slaughter.\n- Terrain and environment is good, it ranges from different areas and ''worlds'' to explore, everything from new york (if I'm not mistaken) to huge deserts where hostile threats are yet to be found.\n- As the game progresses you'll obtain new items, upgrades, special moves, and character upgrades (different tokens, health and wrath)\n- Creativity is shown, the economy here isn't the typical gold, or dollars, here you deal with 3 different type of souls, money1, wrath2 and health3. Blue1, yellow2 and green3 ( Number behind indicates which colour is for which thing.)\n- Graphics are good. cutscenes are good, nothing bad which I've noticed\n- Music is quite good, it fits the situations you're in perfectly, it's basically this Synchronisation that's highly appealing and creates this dramatic effect.\n\nCons:\n- Game might crash when you alt+tab and enter back to the game, so if you must alt+tab, remember to save right before you do.\n- too many puzzles at certain times, but look at the bright side, if you like challenges and like to exercise your brain, this will be no con to you.\n- Some bosses are just too easy, it isn't overwhelmingly easy, but they just don't feel as hard as they should have ( might be cause I played in normal and not apocalyptic, silly me :C)\n\nConclusion: I would just like to say that I had a really good time playing this, at times I got shivers down my neck and goose bumps by the story alone. This is one of the best games I've played in a long while, I got this constant thrill and at times my adrenaline was just soo high. If you are considering on purchasing this, stop hesitating and just buy this. It's really worth it, if you are a tf2 trader, go to market and buy the franchise pack for 5 keys, it's worth every single penny, I promise. that's all I had to say.\n\nPersonal score 10/10","June 28, 2015","true","19.4"," 21 of 22 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","21","22","0","5"

So save if you need to tab out.\n-Achievements are broken a fix is to restart steam and then launch it first.\n\nIn conclusion I highly recommend if you are considering to buy it and do not own a controller that you should buy this game on a sale and with the money you save buy a controller.","May 24, 2015","true","38.1"," 17 of 18 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","17","18","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ichikumer/recommended/50620/","ichikumer","ichik","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ichikumer/","1268 products in account","I once wrote in a Castlevania: Lords of Shadow 2 review that it definitely has the most zealous prologue in video game history. Truth is, there is another game that can dispute this title; that is Darksiders. It literally starts with an apocalypse. And though it isn’t maybe as brilliantly directed as Castlevania’s reboot, but how can you beat such dramatic premise? The judgment day had come; four horsemen of the apocalypse were summoned to the Earth. You play as one of those four — War. He is big. He is muscular. He wields a gigantic sword. He is constantly enraged. And finally, he is voiced by Liam O’Brien, who once told you that you are not prepared, and who always performs like he’s totally ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off and has had a three day lasting constipation. Arriving on Earth our hero finds out that he is alone. That it was all someone’s ruse, because the final seventh seal was not broken. War goes on a series of angsty battles against various demons in pursuit of the one who’s responsible for this, and finally ends up fighting a gigantic boss.\nAnd this is the tutorial part, so it’s supposed to be easy, so the protagonist ends up being imprisoned by The Charred Council, mysterious creatures “overseeing the balance” while looking like big stone head statues. He cuts a very shady deal with them for a bit of “detective” work on Earth, finding the deceiver who killed billions of humans and started out a war between angels and demons, lasting more than one hundred years. Yeah, for some reason War has been kept for so long, and now he’s weakened, so good bye, overpowered abilities from the prologue, you won’t see them ‘till you are fully levelled-up and nearly through the game. I hope, at this point you are totally getting that this is a story that says “♥♥♥♥ logic” and bursts out in a series of delirious, bizarre events, that actually are quite entertaining. From the point of style it’s obvious lowbrow; in case you didn’t know game’s creative director was John Madureira, a comic artist best known for his work on Uncanny X-Men series. So, yeah this game is power-fantasy, and it’s filled with testosterone like a gym locker room.\nA notable thing about this game is, that back in the day, when it was released, it most usually was described as Zelda wrapped up in Warhammer or Warcraft, maybe with the added scent of God of War. And it’s true, of course. But the real game’s sibling was always Castlevania, series which shifted to explorational gameplay being inspired by Zelda. There’s really no point in my nitpicking here, other than an obvious intent to define most of the Zeldas as metroidvanias. So, yeah it has a rich ramified big world filled with puzzles, bosses, minions and secrets (maybe even too big, especially if you talk about those portal section near the end, ugh). And it’s open to explore in virtually any order, but in reality to access certain areas you’d need special abilities or keys and that means sticking to the script, being a good horseman of the apocalypse and going where you are told to. That means, player will rarely be stuck somewhere, and that’s good news, because there's a lot of good stuff. The scope and scale on which Darksiders operate isn’t just big, it’s enormous. What starts as a pretty mediocre one-button-mashing slasher set in though very interesting scenery of post-apocalyptic Earth being torn apart by demons and angels turns out to be much more. Of course, no one would take away your severed heads, buckets of blood, game’s bread and butter, but there’s more to that. Riding a horse, and fighting on a horse (hey, you’re horseman after all)? Check. Shooting stuff with your pistol, with big angelic gun or while riding a gryphon in shoot-em-up section? You got it. And then there’s more and then some.\nOne can argue that game lacks innovation, but at the end of the day it doesn’t matter. Vigil took what they can here and there, but they didn’t lack self-irony and they took it knowing how to use it to create a game that is good entertainment.","July 20, 2014","true","24.3"," 24 of 31 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","24","31","0","1"

A dark and twisted take on the Biblical Apocalypse, that features an awesome storyline, wrapped into a visually modern hack-and-slash style game, but with many time-tested gameplay mechanics still in place.\nThe game will take newcomers at least 12 hours to beat, and along the way it delivers a very well distributed amount of great storytelling, hardhitting combat (which has finishing moves that you simply can't get enough of), and challenging puzzles. At no point does one thing or the other become boring, and this might be Darksiders' biggest strength.\nIt might have been developed for consoles and then ported to PC some time later, but don't let that fool you. The controls are still good, and it doesn't take much time to get used to playing with a keyboard and a mouse. All keys are rebindable.\nThe game might crash on occasion, so remember to save often.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/guudjah/recommended/50620/","guudjah","Arth","http://steamcommunity.com/id/guudjah/","193 products in account","Darksiders is a game that piqued my interest several years ago when it first came out. Inspired by a genre I really enjoy but taken in a grittier, and more combat oriented direction. Which sounded like the best of both worlds. For a first outing the games designed at an okay level.\n\nAt a basic level the game is fun, and functional. Animations are nice, your character is responsive and combat is very rarely unfair. Though that level of fun is drained by decisions both small and large that really inhibit the game from obtaining its true potential.\n\nWhile combat is fun at a basic level, it never really evolves. Basic enemies never challenged me to change my attack plans. Even when mechanics like blocking were added to enemies, launching them still bypassed it, which launching is part of the basic attack string. While in the air you are functionally invulnerable to all but a few basic enemies as well as enemies have no aerial attacks or grabs of any kind and as such they generally waddle in to get hit along side your launched target and die.\n\nThere are heavy and miniboss enemies that are littered throughout the game, but they are either forgettable and unchallenging or downright unfair and cheap. The unfair enemies generally have mistimed attacks that don't feel in line with where you should be attempting to parry. This means it takes far more experimentation to find out if an attack is even parriable in the first place, let alone get the timing right. There's also the problem that attacks really aren't intuitive as to whether they're parriable or not. A miniboss with giant exploding flaming hands can be parried, while An overhead slam with an axe from a skeleton is not.\n\nThe game also has issues with targetting. I seriously believe that if you are making a third person spectacle fighter, you really really need to have a good camera. When focusing on a single enemy the camera zooms in extremely close behind your character, so much so that  you can't keep track of opponents behind you or to the side as well as you should. This means focusing for the most part is not what you want to do, as you will take free damage from enemies that you can no longer see.\n\nThere's also the problem of what the game decides you want to target. In my opinion hitting the focus button should prioritize the enemy closest to the player first and foremost, then allow you to cycle if you want someone else. This allows the player to quickly swap to the largest threat in their vicinity without the hassle of swapping targets. In the middle of combat I found it frustrating on multiple occasions using my right hand to use the thumbstick to swap between targets. With your right hand also being used to attack jump and evade, there is too much burden placed on you to control both the camera and combat at the same time. Thus I find it very unintuitive.\n\nBosses are for the most part are boring as well. They for the most part have sequences where you have to use a gimmick or tool you obtained in the dungeon to weaken them just to fight them. This is saddening, as fighting them face to face is what's genuinely fun. Not waiting X seconds to throw a bomb to knock the boss to the ground while running around in circles. Some bosses are actually genuinely fun, as they have no gimmicks attached to them, and that is where the game shines. But they are few and far between.\n\nFor the most part the tools you get are pretty nifty, they are fun to use and modify combat in a genuinely interesting way. With the exception of the horse, it just doesn't fit into the way the game is designed and feels shoehorned. The game has a very claustrophobic closed in feel, where you are progressing through tunnels and buildings, not wide open fields. Where you actually use the horse is in the one area it was designed for. That area is just designed for the horse, there's no reason for it to be so large, except to give the horse a purpose. One that really doesn't mesh with the rest of the game. You can't ride the horse inside, combat on the horse is unwieldy and riding it feels more like driving a tank than a horse. I'm not a fan.\n\nThe dungeons themselves have a great aesthetic design. I like how they look, I thoroughly enjoyed my time inside each one, as they all have their own flair. But the game, really holds your hand whenever you enter a new room as it forces you into a cutscene that slowly pans from object to object in the order  you have to use them. The puzzles are basic as it is, to also show me where each piece is and the order to use it in turns each room into a really boring series of fetch quests. Grab a bomb from location A, bring it to location B.\n\nThe writing is mixed as well. While the main character and the only female character fall flat and into generic stereotypes. One being dark and edgy, while the other a perfect example of a damsel in distress. The side characters however are genuinely interesting. For example, the maker you meet called Black Hammer is by far the best character. He is not flat, one dimensional and his entire backstory is not revealed in one sentence. The same can be said of Samael as well.\n\nThe game could have really shined if it had more development time. At a basic level the game is functional and can be fun if taken in small quantities. Though it gets repetitive really fast, from both a combat, boss and puzzle perspective. If you really enjoy this genre there is fun to be had. Otherwise I would highly recommend the second game in this series or another game series altogether.","March 15, 2014","false","14.4"," 56 of 89 people (63%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","63","56","89","2","0"

The game reminded me of a cross between Legend of Zelda and God of War. The plot of the story isn't necessarily anything to write home about, but the actual atmosphere of the game is superb. I found the environments in particular to be highly immersive; each area has its own unique theme. The non-player character models, including their animations, are extraordinary.\n\nThe combat isn't particularly evolved and the game itself isn't exactly challenging. I personally played on Apocalyptic and would recommend others do the same. There were a surprising amount of puzzles, invariably utilizing some recently acquired gadget. These items are often necessary for collectibles, but rarely are required in areas beyond which they were designed.\n\nIf I had to summarize my experience with this game I would say this: It starts very strong, but begins to struggle in the end. There are enough "awesome" moments that keep you engaged through the ~15 hours but the repetitious challenge/puzzle formula, shallow improvement system, and anticlimactic ending make for a mediocre finish.\n\nI still recommend the game. It was quite an enjoyable adventure and I'm looking forward to seeing more of this stylish world in Darksiders II.\n","May 2, 2015","true","29.5"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","13","14","0","1"

You should get Abyssal Armor, quit to menu, then start a new game with Abyssal armor, finally save the game. It's the only way to start a new game with Abyssal Armor.\nAchievements: If you load de the game multiple times in a single session, Steam will stop counting your achievements, the only way to solve this, is running the game in Big Picture, then look on your achievements, if they're displaying 0/0, you have to restart Steam to fix, and avoid to load game manually.\nSpoiler Alert\n\nAbaddon appears in the bible as both a place of destruction and as the name of an angel. The Latin Vulgate and the Douay Rheims Bible have additional notes (not present in the Greek text), "in Latin Exterminans", exterminans being the Latin word for "destroyer". So if you know this, you will know who is the Destroyer in Darksiders :D","April 16","true","23.7"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/twelve20two/recommended/50620/","twelve20two","Twelve20two","http://steamcommunity.com/id/twelve20two/","54 products in account","This game is pretty badass. It plays like a mixture of Zelda and God of War/Devil May Cry/Bayone- Look, you do puzzles and crazy combo attacks, and sometimes you press a button/key to rip some poor soul's limbs off. It is, for the most part, mindless entertainment (other than the puzzles and the brief strategy involved in the combat).\n\nThe story is based on the Judeo-Christian Apocalypse and one member of its heralds, War of the Four Horsemen, accidentally starting the end of the world too soon. It quickly becomes a story of revenge, justice, and answers as War travels across a destroyed earth (or, more accurately and area that could easily be just what/where New York City and some part of New Jersey used to be. It's not the full planet) taking down other biblical beasts and monsters of both Heaven's and Hell's host. If I am not mistaken, War is actually described as, "Hunted by Heaven, and Hated by Hell."\nWhile its fun, it is a bit straight forward up until the end, in which you're thrown a few twists and turns.\n\nSpeaking of being straight forward, the game is fairly linear, but in a more Zelda-y or Halo: CE sense than a Call of Duty and FINAL FANTASY XIII way. You're given many areas (Forgive me for not remembering the exact number, it's actually been months since I played the game) to explore in a pseudo-open world sense, with at least one dungeon per area. In the dungeons, you go back and forth between combat and solving puzzles to progress, and like in Zelda, acquiring a new skill or tool to complete the dungeon and open up old paths for exploration in the other areas.\n\nI know I keep referencing Zelda, and while some might consider that to be a bad thing, I certainly don't. I love that franchise, and the only reason I keep alluding to it is because it's a forerunner in its field (kinda), and it really is the best comparison I can make with this game. I'm sure there are a bunch of other puzzle-y, platform-y, RPG-ish games out there that have the same feel as Darksiders, but I just don't know them.\n\nAnyway, the sound design is pretty damn spot on. Things squish, crunch, rip and smash in brutally good sounding ways, and War sounds like the embodiment of destruction should. Oh, and Mark Hamil has a voice in this game, and he's always welcome because, well, hell, it's Luke GOSHDANG Skywalker and The Joker (and Skips). The demons sound demonic, the angels sound pious and righteous, and the music... Um. The music didn't stand out to me, at least not like the sequel's does. It was adequate. Enough for a post-apocalyptic action game.\n\nThe art design is definitely one of my favorite aspects of this game, and the sequel too. It's all comic book-y, and I love it. There's plenty of realism in the environment and some of the characters, but not enough that it looks like it's trying too hard, and not too little to the point that it feels like I'm defintely looking at a cartoon.\n\nNow, there is leveling and a small degree of customization involved in the game, but I quickly found a weapon I wanted (which do not present themselves too often) and loaded it with the skill I liked the most (health absorption and DoT, mainly), so I didn't really delve too deeply into the game's RPG elements. Oops (look, this is my first big review, and like I said, it's been a while. Please don't kill me).\n\n\n\nSo I think I covered everything I needed to regarding this game: setting, story, sound, visuals, gameplay. I'm sure I'm missing some stuff, but I don't think I'd be able to say much on it in that case. Anyway, I'd definitely recommend this game. At its worst, the game feels like a 6.5/10 (which it really only hits when trying to solve awkward puzzles), and at its best it's about an 8.5/10 (which it hits quite frequently in my book). Solid game. Solid entry to the genre of Action RPGs. Solid start to a series that I still hope continues on with good development like the first two.\n\n'S good game.","November 25, 2014","true","21.7"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","0"

Unfortunatly the keyboard and mouse controls are bad no matter what configuration you have and very often and many of the achivements for me didnt work, so now it looks like i skipped whole boss fights and didnt collect weapons that i do have. also the mouse likes to fly back to the center of the screen (even when using 360 game controller) whenever you enter your inventory or map which gets very annoying if you use them often. so i reccomend this version of the game to only peopl who poses controllers and dont care to much about collecting achivements. if u dont fall in that category get the ps3 or xbox 360 version","October 5, 2014","true","20.7"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

I had been really missing the whole dungeons with totally epic boss battles vibe, and Darksiders delivers.  The story is a little odd at first, but I got more into it as the game went on.  My favorite section is fighting when you first get your horse and fight this awesome arena battle and the subsequent sandworm boss -- I was totally sucked into the atmosphere.\n\nAnother great aspect of the game is the on-the-fly loading.  I'm surprised no one else has mentioned this, but it's huge for me.   I play games to immerse myself in another world, so I HATE loading screens, and in this game you can run across the entire game world without a single one!  Applause to the developers for that one.\n\nIt falls in to the hack-n-slash style of combat with projectile weaponry mixed in for variety.  There's a lot of combos, and it can get a little tedious if you don't force yourself to try new moves.  That being said, each dungeon typically requires you to use new skills to defeat the boss, it's more about switching things up on the smaller enemies.\n\nI do wish more of the characters were a little more likeable, but I get why they are the way they are.  All-in-all, if you loved games like Zelda: Ocarina of Time back in the day, get this for sure.","February 4, 2014","true","48.4"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

It's a mix between a God of War styled combat and Zelda exploration and puzzle solving.\n\nPros\n\n-Nice combat that gradually introduces new weapons and items to use\n-A big world that allows for a bit of exploration\n-Good amount of upgrades for both your weapons, moveset and other modes\n-Not that many items but they all have their purpose that makes them unique\n\nCons\n\n-Not enough enemies. In a game where the combat is one of the major elements, it doesn't help when you usually only fight 5 or so enemies at a time. There is also little enemy variety.\n-The world is huge but doesn't feel natural. With no towns or relevant NPCs or sidequests, it feels like a giant corridor. There is little reason for backtracking other than getting to chests you couldn't reach before, which you either have to do  every single time you get a new item or wait until the end of the game when you already have every item\n-Enemies placed outside of dungeons are repetitive and sometimes a few zones won't even have any enemies at all\n-Too easy, both the combat and the puzzles, safe for a few examples near the end.\n-Nothing new about any element in the game. All items and puzzles have a certain "been there, done that" feel to them.\n\nConclusion: I realise that I listed more Cons than pros, but I still enjoyed the game. It just seemed to be dragged down by a lack of originality and a few amateurish flaws like the overworld's design and the simplicity of both the items, their function and the puzzles themselves.\n\nI recomend it to anyone who enjoys this type of game, unless you're craving for something new and original, which darksiders doesn't provide at all. It competently follows the mold of all the elements in most action/adventure games, nothing more, nothing less.","February 21","true","24.2"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

You can get really creative while fighting them, dodging their attacks, countering their blows and hitting their weakspots and finally finishing them with a unique blow that often gets pretty ugly.

It really was great up to that, but the longwinded finale is so tedious and boring that I won't be finishing it and will watch a Youtube video of the rest of the game instead.\n\nEvery task no longer feels FUN anymore, they all just feel like WORK, like enduring heavy sack upon heavy sack as an 18th century underpaid dock worker. Ending parts includes a PORTAL device and you all know what that means - super gamey and boring puzzles that are not hard to figure out, only hard to stomach.\n\nUgh, I'm just now watching the YT vid, showing you have to spend an absurd amount of time backtracking all over previous finished/empty levels, just to collect 7 pieces of some "special" sword to stab the final boss with - so happy I skipped it. Even the VIDEOS are so boring I have to skip and fast-forward them. It looks like having to do the Water Temple in Zelda 10x in a row. Or doing the awful backtracking in Metroid Prime 2: Echoes in slow motion. Way to top of the game with the biggest yawn in history.\n\nI still recommend the game, albeit now with a bad taste in my mouth. Huge disappointment to a game I had pegged as one of the greats of its genre and generation. Why any developer so desperately needs to paint an ugly moustache on their beautiful, nearly finished Mona Lisa masterpiece of a game, I will never know. While playing through the last parts should not even enter your thoughts, I must admit it WAS worth suffering through the videos to see the end cut scene and last dialogue line.\n\nIf you can look past the big moustache, you still have a great, bada$$ painting underneath.\n\n-----------------------------------------\n\nOriginal review:\nSweetie, remember to pause a bit from your game and thank uncle Bob immediately when he comes over later, for getting you this game you didn't know much about beforehand. After all, you have been playing it non-stop with your best friend all Christmas morning, haven't you? Taking turns playing the game and sipping at that dark, sweet hot chocolate, helping eachother out with the map, the puzzles and the bosses. Everything in the world is great and awesome and you have your life ahead of you.\n\nTHAT'S the feeling I get from this game.\n\nOf course, I could talk at lenghts about how the late game company's cup runneth over in all other aspects of this gem. The pretty as ♥♥♥♥♥ graphics, great music, just enough tough bosses, fantastic combos and just the right amount of combat variety. But I want you to focus on that feeling instead. Just buy it already and enjoy playing this wonderful and FUN, FUN, FUN visual novel hybrid of elements from Devil May Cry, Dark Souls, Legend of Zelda and other great titles.\n\nTHQ is dead - Long live THQ!

It's not without its flaws - particularly as an unfriendly PC port - but the storytelling and combat are good enough to justify the price of admission.\n\nYou play as War, one of the four horsemen of the apocalypse. Dressed like something out of Warhammer 40K, and wielding a huge two-handed sword named Chaoseater, War has been summoned to Earth to take part in the final battle between angels, demons and man. Or so he thinks.\n\nWhen it is revealed that the horsemen were not in fact summoned, War is accused of taking the apocalypse into his own hands and sentenced to death. He successfully protests, and vows to right his wrong, but also to uncover why he was on Earth if he had not been summoned.\n\nWar employs a variety of familiar weapons and tools reminiscent of Zelda, but with a twist. The magical boomerang becomes the crossblade (huge shuriken), instead of a bow and arrow War carries a pistol named Mercy, and the hookshot is known as the Abyssal Chain. He also has some magic, but all these play second fiddle to the combo-based swordplay.\n\nThree main weapons are at War's disposal: the aforementiond Chaoseater, a mystical scythe, and a powered fist weapon, of which the sword and one of either the scythe or fist can be equipped at any one time. Tapping the attack button for either begins a chain, and you can incorporate attacks from either of his two weapons at any time. Delaying input for half a second at certain points in the combo can open up new combo moves, usually with a situational purpose such as an area attack, and War can also launch and air combo his enemies if he so desires.\n\nThe weapons and tools have upgrades, not just simply increasing damage but adding new combo moves and abilities, such as a spinning airborne slash for the Chaoseater or allowing the crossblade to bounce between nearby enemies. When things get really hectic, War can transform into a big fiery demon for a short amount of time, greatly increasing the power of his attacks and making him near-invulnerable. The only real problem with the combat is that there aren't enough keys on an xbox controller (mouse and keys are not ideal) to map everything, meaning you'll mostly be sticking to two or three favoured items.\n\nDarksiders is a worthy addition to any collection, and clocking in at less than 20 hours means it's good value for money without becoming a drag. The combat is fast-paced and varied, and the presentation while dated is expertly executed. The only real issue with it is the dodgy PC compatability, which you can choose to fix or ignore, and meaning that you'll probably want a controller if you really want to enjoy it.\n\n+ Combat is great fun\n+ The setting and story are well conceptualised\n- Dodgy PC port","February 1, 2014","true","17.3"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

I was expecting a cheap God of War Clone, but it's far better than that. For one thing the Horseman War is far more interesting a character than Kratos, whose one-note vengeance act is wearing pretty thin. Great atmosphere, fun combat, very creative puzzles, and some of the best creature design ever. It's a long game with tons of bosses, and they're all awesome looking. New elements are constantly introduced to keep it fresh--grappling hook, horseback combat, and even some Portal dynamics near the end. The biggest criticism is that Darksiders doesn't do anything new, but combining all these great elements from other games so successfully IS something new.","November 10, 2013","true","63.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

I was immediately impressed with the gameplay, and the graphics are decent, although the cutscenes graphics are lacking compared to in-game graphics, which can be forgiven for a 4-5 year old game.\n\nThe gameplay almost never gets stale, it changes up enough to keep it from getting boring. Even when you have to fight the same mini-boss multiple times they change it up enough to keep it interesting. On normal mode the game seemed easy, so if you are an avid, able gamer, I suggest playing on difficult.\n\nThis is one of my favorite games of all time. The puzzles are interesting and the story is good. It reminds me of The Legend of Zelda puzzles crossed with World of Warcraft style graphics, and the combat is reminiscent of slashers like Devil May Cry and hero titles like Arkham Asylum and Deadpool, where grappling an enemy makes the other baddies wait for you to finish.\n\nCompleting the game took roughly 24 hours of gameplay on normal mode while hunting down every upgrade, armor piece and treasure chest I could find.","December 20, 2014","true","65.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Luriam/recommended/50620/","Luriam","Luriam","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Luriam/","307 products in account","Darksiders™ is one of the first action-adventure hack and slash games I've ever played. And I have experienced something absolutely unique and peculiar. I never thought I'd like as much as I did.\n\nWhen I first started the game I had no idea what's going on. The game looked so complex and chaotic at first. Even though I was getting a lot of tips and hints like this - "Use War's Wrath to enter Chaos Form"; I was still feeling lost. But after about half an hour things became much more easier. And the next day the game was crystal clear to me. It felt like I was reading a very interesting book. With every turn of it's page, I was experiencing a new, fascinating adventure which charmed me all the way to the bones.\n\nThe gameplay consists of combat, puzzles and exploration. You start as one of the "Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse" - War. You become a blank page, and start slowly getting stronger, faster, smarter. As you continue to progress, all sorts of new weapons, powers and artifacts will be unlocked. Some are unlocked automatically, and others require a fair share of exploring in order to be found. All sorts of things are scattered arround in the decaying post-apocalyptic world. Including a lot of hard-to-find collectibles that reward the player in various pleasing ways. Better weapons allow you to defeat your enemies with greater alacrity. New equipment such as: the "Crossblade", or the "Revolver" also comes in handy when dealing with certain enemies or even some puzzles. Along with weapon-based attacks, War can also use an array of magic-based attacks, known as Wrath powers, that are both offensive and defensive in nature. War's most powerful ability is that he can transform into his Chaos Form: which transforms him into a large, fiery and extremely resistant entity that can cause heavy damage. But my favorite ability comes at a later point in the game. It is the ability to summon War's own fiery horse - Ruin. Not only that it provides faster movement, but also boosts War's attacks greatly. What could be better than riding a fast fiery horse through the golden desert while shooting giant sand-worms with your revolver from it's back ?\n\nThe boss battles are awesome in Darksiders™. They feel epic and grand, full of determination and occasionally, oh who am I trying to fool, and mostly gore. War has a unique way to kill each particular type of enemy, usually tearing them apart painfully. Especially the bosses, by ripping their hearts out with his bare hands.\n\nSpeaking of War... he is one of the most vibrant and intense protagonists I've ever seen. Liam O'Brien did an amazing job voicing War, giving him the perfect attitude and emotions. War is a powerful warrior with a strong sense of honor who will stop at nothing to gain revenge for being betrayed. The fury of his massive sword is unmatched in combat. As unyielding as time itself, War is both honorable and savage. Which makes him very memorable and likeable, and easily one of my favorite characters ever.\n\nThe game generally feels great. There are a lot of different places to visit. Starting from the hot depths of hell filled with lava, and ending with the pure and peaceful Eden itself. You get to meet angels and demons, spiders and ghouls, skeletons and abominations, and a lot of other creatures that you could count as "Supernatural".\n\nDarksiders™ has an epic score and an amazing voice acting. It looks fantastic and the story is long and inspiring. Filled with revenge and honor, but also the idea of constant fight between good and evil. With the player taking the role of War, who is lost between those two. Definitely recommended to everyone who loves a great adventure with a bloody fighting system.\n\n\n\n10/10","April 16, 2014","true","85.3"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","2"

There are a lot of collectibles as well that makes gameplay even longer and more entertaining.","April 1","true","28.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The game features extremely cinematic fighting and , unlike a number of other games like it , does not rely on QTs quite as much with only the occasional B button.\n\nSpeaking of the B button , even though this is a PC game , an Xbox pad is highly recommended. Button mashing when it comes to a keyboard is a bit dodgy , even if you are good. This really goes for all hack and slash games since it puts way too much strain on your hardware to make sense using it to smash your foes' faces in.\n\nThe storyline will pick you up and leave you guessing at the next twist. Just be sure that it will guide you very well onto the end. The game does have open world elements but the path is a little more restricted than I would like. There are a large number of areas but not every part of it is traversable. In Darksiders 2 , there are huge open fields and deserts which give a great feelign of the scale of the world. Darksiders feels kind of squashed into a small area. There is plenty of variety in your foes , though , so there probably won't be many times where you have to stop to look at the view.\n\nProblem solving is in the game but is very minimal. Don't buy this if you are looking for puzzles from the old Tomb Raider games.\n\nLength wise , the game is sufficiently long to keep you entertained. I would have liked a little more but perhaps it would run out of steam if it was going too long.","January 14, 2014","true","28.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

The Hell hates you."\n\nDarksiders is a brutal Hack'n'Slay Adventure.\n\n___________________________________________________\n++Story++\nIn 2010, the Earth is going to be hit by some meteorites. These are not just rocks, but the actual armies of Heaven and Hell, ready to fight each other in an epic battle. Mid in the fight, another man falls from the sky: The Apocalyptic Horseman War. He does not fight for any side in the battle, he is just there to keep the balance, but there is one problem. The Horsemen are only allowed to interfere when the 7 seals are broken. And nobody broke them. War gets teleported to the fiery council, who go into court with him because he broke this rule. He tells them that he has gone to earth because he thought the seals were broken. The fiery council gives him another chance to get rid of his guilt, by killing The Destroyer, the one who started the battle between heaven and hell. So War gets sent back to earth, 100 years after the apocalypse.\n\n\n++Gameplay++\nThe gameplay is a typical Hack'n'Slay. War is badassily strong and gets to fight against a lot of enemies at once. His sword swings hit many enemies at once, and there are other weapons to be aquired with other abilities. The battles feel good and fluid, the finisher moves are brutal and the blocking/evading works great.\nBut there is more than just fighting. The game provides levels and riddles that make it feel like the result of hot sex between God of War and The Legend of Zelda. The riddles can get really hard at times, but not frustratingly hard, so the game does not get boring.\nThere are a lot of collectibles in the open world, and they also help War, like the Abyssal Armor. There are 10 pieces to find, that are pretty well hidden. If you find all pieces, you get one badass armor.\nSadly, the programming is weak at times and lets the game crash from time to time. There are also some bugs, like falling through the ground (happened to me 4 times). Good thing that there are enough checkpoints to make up for such annoying bugs.\n\n\n++Grafics++\nThe grafics like a bit comic-like. The characters look extremely packed with muscles, blood squirts en masse, the bosses are huge and monstrous. The environment is very variable, from the destroyed remains of New York over a forest to a huge desert. The light effects look great and the textures are detailed.\n\n\n++Music++\nHuge, aggressive sounds of orchestral rage are violating your ears in this game. The music fits extremely good with a game where you play as The Apocalyptic Horseman War himself.\n\n\n++Features++\nGiven that Darksiders has a little bit of a comic style, there is also an actual official comic that helps the players understand the lore and get more information about the 4 Apocalyptic Horsemen. Search it on google, it is worth it.\n\n___________________________________________________\n\nWhat to say about this game?\nGod of War + The Legend of Zelda = Darksiders <3","February 25, 2015","true","40.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

However it just could not live up to my expectations. With cartoonish (yet crisp and clean) visual style, dull storyline and generic hack'n'slash experience it's just a mediocre game. Generally, there's nothing poor about it and yet nothing excellent either. It has just enough to keep you going until the end.\n\nThe only particular feature in this game I liked was the ability to summon and ride a horse (in the second half of the game). There are not many games you can do that.\n\nHowever there were some faults in this game that allmost ruined the whole gameplay. They definitely were irritating.\n\n- Slow ranged weapon controls.\n- Gigantic bosses in small rooms. It does not substitute for good camera performance. When the developers will learn that? Atleast make the room bigger! So that the boss fits in the field of view.\n- Overwhelmingly strong enemies at times, some of which are as strong as sub-bosses and it takes eternity to kill them.\n- Bugs: achievements do not always unlock; some rooms do not unlock or freeze and you are forced to restart the whole game.\n- Almost no clues. You have to guess everything on your own or watch YouTube to actually understand what to do.\n- One of the last chapters is all about puzzles. It's a puzzle after a puzzle, after a puzzle, after a puzzle, some fighting and puzzles again. Not that the puzzles are hard, they're actually quite simple, it's just that this chapter is SOOO LOOOONG AND BORING, that I almost quit the whole game. It was a torment for me.\n- Pointless game saving feature, because you will restart from the last checkpoint anyway (as with autosave), which would be fine unless....\n- THE CUTSCENES! You enter the boss arena. A cutscene > 1 min, the boss kills you, you start from the checkpoint again. Each time you die, you are forced to watch the cutscene again. You can skip them, but not completely.\n\nAnd, finally, what's with the anime locks hanging out from War's hood? Absolutely ridiculous!\n\nWhat starts as a decent hack'n'slash experience ends as a torment. My overall rating 6/10.\nWould I recommend to buy this game? Barely. Only with a discount.","October 17, 2014","true","38.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Unlike a Devil May Cry, you can explore an open world. The story is also as great as a Devil May Cry (DMC). As a DMC your currency are souls which are obtained by defeating ennemies or opening some chests. There are 3 kinds of souls in fact : health (green), currency (blue) and wrath (yellow). Like a DMC you'll unlock several close and long range fighting weapons, purchase many moves and wrath abilities. Finally there is the famous dungeons and bosses areas.\n\nWhat a great game to feel strong and invincible. I would say a relaxing game.\n\n(#) :\nOne very good glitch at the end of the game, is that you can spawn horsemen as you whish by leaving and entering the area. A very epic fight with your horse.\n\n(*) :\nIf you wish to have all achievements you must follow the tips listed below (thanks to a guide on steam) :\n- Turn off the steam overlay in the game, exit steam (steam -> exit), launch steam and play the game.\n- You can only play one session of Darksiders in each steam session, if the game crash it count too. So the famous exit steam (steam -> exit), launch steam and play the game is needed.\n- Always made saves before the part where you should unlock an achievement if you want to prevent the points above.","March 18","true","43.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ge0stigma/recommended/50620/","ge0stigma","geøstigma","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ge0stigma/","227 products in account","This is one of those games that is appealing on so many levels. For start, i immediately noticed that the game is designed beautifully, from world to creatures, and ofcourse, the main character which really looks like the embodyment of war, wielding the biggest, and the most badass sword since Buster Sword. Story is very well written and actors did an amazing job voicing those cut scenes followed by memorable soundtrack. As for the gameplay, being the most important aspect of video games in my oppinion, i would say that the developers nailed it.\n\nI have heard people comparing Darksiders with Zelda games and i would say they are right, cause Darksiders is one of those multy gameplay aspect games. You will be doing everything from world exploring, treasure hunting, money farming, puzzle solving, character upgrading and battling all kinds of enemies in this game.\n\nExploration is fun and very enjoyable because of the above mentioned beutifully designed world and many secrets that it hides.  Often you will come across new tools that will allow you to revisit all those places you have been at before but now you would be able to reach all those previously inaccessible spots and claim their treasures.\n\nCombat is great, and i loved the fact that every enemy is challenging in its own way and that you can easily get outnumbered and usually killed if you dont use all the tools and moves that are at your disposal. Its fairly simple but at the same time, requires concentration and awareness. You will want to learn your enemies moves and try to counter them when they make an opening or by executing a perfect parry which will usually devastate them. Sadly, this game has a reverse difficulty curve, meaning that it will be hardest at the start and in time, combat will become much less challenging as u grow in power. However, boss fights are amazing! They are a perfect blend of combat skills and puzzle, and you can always count on these to provide a fair challenge.\n\nAlso, you should know that this game is not very well ported for PC. Expect FPS drops in some areas(the Ashlands for me) and even game crashing, which, to be honest, happened to me only once, when i first ran the game and met Vulgrim. You probably wont be able to use controller unless u have original XBOX controller(my PS2 controller would make the game unplayable by fixing the camera at awkward angle simply by being plugged in), and no, x360ce probably wont work for you, so you are stuck with a keayboard and mouse. Another very annoying thing are steam achievements which you will not be able to get unless you are running the game for the first time. Every time you quit and re-run Darksiders, you wont be able to achieve anything. Luckily, this is fixed in seconds by simply quitting steam and re-starting it again but you will have to do it every time you wanna play this game.\n\nI usually try to go in details with my reviews but, to be honest, that would be it. Game has a simple concept, A to B route, filled with battle encounters, secrets and occasional puzzles(which are also simple but fun), and its executed perfectly. If you take these bad PC porting flaws out of the picture, Darksiders is an amazing game and likely one that you will remember and recommend","September 10, 2014","true","26.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It's a fun game as the story was interesting with a decent enough hack and slash fighting system with combos and such. The enemies vary vastly and the bosses are always different. Big lack of PC settings though, you can only change the resolution and v-sync, no aliasing, filtering, etc, just poor port settings.\n\nThe gameplay, like I said, is similar in vein to The Legend of Zelda, but with a lot more blood. You are War, one of the Four Horsemen sent to confront Abaddon during the final Judgement on Earth. And you fight demons and sheeit, just like Link. The fighting style is even similar, block and attack when possible. Take advantage of enemy weak spots. Roll around and jump attack. Very similar indeed. Even the horse riding and climbing is similar.\n\nStill a good game though, despite the flaws with the porting and some minor frame rate issues.\n\n8.0/10","September 26, 2013","true","22.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The parts that were good were extremely good. The parts that were bad stuck out like a sore thumb. The story was amazing, characters were interesting, and the environment was ridiculously beautiful (as beautiful as a post apocolyptic world can be). This game had everything going for it. Weapon upgrades evenly spaced out giving you enough time to play around with them all without getting bored. I loved the sidequest that had me gather tokens from every zone, giving me rewards for each one i collected. This was the first game I used every single power up because they were ALL useful and beneficial. This is by far one of my personal favorite games I own.\n\nOnto the bad. One thing that frustrated me most is that the Achievements for this game can and will glitch out. I cant even remember how many times i would find all the collectables and realize the game FORGOT to award the achievement and thus result in me having to RESTART THE GAME in order to get it all over again. This is only an issue if you care about achievements, this does not hinder gameplay in any way. The second thing I can complain about is the lack of replayability value to this game. Once you defeat the bosses and aquire the collectables, there is no reason to go back, and the enemies get replaced with weaker ones, making the zone a joke to clear. If this game let me restart with my currencies after i beat it, that would make it much more fun and give me that reason to play it again. But as it stands, once you obtain the collectables and beat the bosses, there isnt much of a reason to continue playing.\n\nIn conclusion, this game offered me a great experience while progressing through the story. Problems arose as you start entering your last quarter of the game where there becomes less and less to do. It's great that you aquired all 10 pieces of your abyssal armor set, to bad there isnt much to do in the game by the time you get it other than defeat the final boss with it or use it while obtaining the last few collectables.\n\n8/10 if i were to rate this game. It's great but could've been better with just a few additions.\n\nEDIT: apparently you can create a new game after you beat the last boss and start with the abyssal armor if you collected all the pieces in your first playthrough. This is vary nice and does add some replayability.","July 29, 2014","true","59.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

And that's a good thing, because instead of simply taking those elements as they are (which is good enough as it is), this game takes all those elements and weaves them into an action adventure game where basically every moment is your character looking, sounding, and feeling like a badass.  In every detail, the position of the main character as a Horseman of the Apocalypse is never in question; your power is even evident in how the character walks and lands when jumping.  To be paired with this, the beautiful post apocalyptic world you explore is similarly fleshed out.  If you yearn for a solid, thorough action adventure game akin to the aforementioned games, this is more than worth a purchase.\n\nOne quick note, as an aside: there IS a quick way to amass souls once you finish the Ashlands.  YouTube would be the best place to look this up; it is heartily helpful for those that, like me, desire every powerup you can get in a game. ;)","December 2, 2013","true","44.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I’m a big fan of the game’s art design and concept, and the gameplay is deceptively simple despite looking really cool. You can watch the game’s opening cinematic on Youtube for a pretty good idea of what to expect in terms of story and style. It’s awesome.\n\nFirst off, it’s an older title so most of you folks should be able to run it with no problem. The game is a 3d “hack & slash” played in third person perspective, but not “over the shoulder.” The game plays well with a controller, but I went through it with keyboard+mouse with no problems.  There’s no “loot” system so you’re fixed in the weapons you can use, but by unlocking different “moves” you can build combos. I’ve heard that the game is really similar to the God of War series in terms of combat, but I’ve never played those so I can’t say for sure. Not only is there a large variety in the enemies you can fight, but there are a bunch of boss battles too. Be warned though that there are puzzle elements to some of the levels which can get very annoying. I had to look online for puzzle solutions a few times.\n\nIn the story, you play as War, one of the mythical 4 Horsemen who are tasked with preserving “The Balance” between Heaven and Hell.  When the “End War” starts and Hell invades the Earth, it’s time for you to step in kick some ♥♥♥, both demon and angel. After you’re done with the game you might scratch your head a bit trying to figure out what happened (why did this character do that?) but when you’re actually playing it doesn’t pull you out of the game. Also, the ending cinematic really revs you up for the sequel.\n\nOverall, the game a definite must play. It’s been in Humble bundles a few times so you might have it without even realizing it. It’s definitely worth your time to play through. A piece of advice though. If you’re playing the game for the first time with the help of an online walkthrough, DON’T collect the Abyssal armor for your first play through. It makes the game too easy.\n","August 18, 2014","true","34.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Darksiders is based on The Four Horseman of the Apocalypse though focuses on one, the protagonist War.\n\nWhat his mission comprises I'll leave to your play-through but he is accompanied by a companion voiced by Mark Hamil of Luke Skywalker fame.  The voice acting is AAA Hollywood material and the characters really come to life because of it.\n\nThe combat is substantially solid and the weapons are few but are socket-able via modifiers and they level as well.  The move sets as usually found in this genre are purchasable by souls that you obtain through various methods.\n\nCreative puzzles dominate some sections but may occasionally break the flow of the game.  There are the customary difficultly levels so whether you are an abecedarian or gods gift there's something here for everyone to luxuriate in.\n\nThe studio responsible for the production, Vigil Games were newcomers on the development scene when the game was produced but I was surprised to see in the credit roll that Silicon Knights had a hand in development as well.

I love the world design which has that special end of the world touch. It has every right to look that way since the story takes place in a time of war between angels and demons in which only the four horseman stand vast in the balance of the world. Story alone is worth every penny of this game. The main character of this game is War. The Badass horseman of the apocalypse which will be one of the most memorable characters you have ever played. The part I dislike about the game is the combat system. You have a massive amount of different combat moves from which you'll end up using only 2-3 in repeat. The other problem with combat system is that War is kind of slow. His moves are sluggish which give enemy a lot of space to break your attacks.

I love the world design which has that special end of the world touch. It has every right to look that way since the story takes place in a time of war between angels and demons in which only the four horseman stand vast in the balance of the world. Story alone is worth every penny of this game. The main character of this game is War. The Badass horseman of the apocalypse which will be one of the most memorable characters you have ever played. The part I dislike about the game is the combat system. You have a massive amount of different combat moves from which you'll end up using only 2-3 in repeat. The other problem with combat system is that War is kind of slow. His moves are sluggish which give enemy a lot of space to break your attacks. Darksiders is a game you should have in your library thought it's a 7.5/10.","December 15, 2014","true","78.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The story is awesome (apocalypse, demons, angels and lots of destruction - what's not to like about that?) and the voice acting is just plain brilliant.\n\nWhile you progress through the game you unlock new combat moves, weapons and abilities - such as the ability to summon Ruin, a fiery phantom steed which makes it easier and faster to travel through the certain areals of the world.\n\nEvery areal features new kinds of enemies such as angels, zombies, spiders, ghosts and more. The bosses are slightly more challenging as they are way faster, bigger and deadlier, which requires special tactics to beat them.\n\nThe playtime (depending on your personal playstyle) is around 8-12 hours for the story. If you want to max out all weapons, find all special abilities and collect all shadow armour pieces you can easily spend 30 hours with the game. I highly recommend playing the game with a Xbox360 controller to enjoy it at it's fullest!","July 3, 2011","true","27.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I recommend it for $5 sales or lower.\n\nI did not enjoy the art style and graphics screamed console port, but this didn't take away from the experience too much, some probably prefer the oversized comic book styling of the characters.\n\nThe game's difficulty gets cranked up due to the array of tools needed to solve some of the level's puzzles - sometimes this made the game clunky and convoluted.  This certainly got tiresome when navigating the Black Throne and the constant repeat and repeat with slight mutations of the puzzles there within.\n\nExcept for the tediousness of the Black Throne, I found the puzzles to be a healthy mental challenge and found the bosses to be fun to figure out and defeat.  Tiamat in the beginning was very difficult.\n\nI finished this game and missed only a handful of artifacts stashed throughout.\nI maxed most of my abilities and tried everything in the game available to me.  I did not use Chaos form and Wrath enough for maxing out OP fun.  The most useful attack in the game is the dash sword attack, it works effectively against all of the enemies and deals the most damage.\n\nI did run into a few known bugs, including:  some of saves were botched and I was forced to redo a couple of parts and a couple of play throughs didn't record achievments.","December 14, 2013","true","28.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Its basically Zelda with a lot more mature setting and harder difficulty. You'll want to play on Apocalyptic difficulty or you'll be doing yourself a disservice!\n\nThe game strikes a good balance between combat, platforming and puzzles. I'll admit it, I was stumped a few times but with enough time and a careful eye you should be able to solve/spot the solutions to the games puzzles. The combat is combo based and requires some precision timing and dodging to do well. You also have various powers and 3 main weapon types that you can weave into the flow.\n\nAs for the setting its post-apocalyptic but ORIGINAL style, that is, ANGELS AND DEMONS and not nuclear war - I like angel/demon style better. :D Some truely epic sights to behold like a giant goth cathedral on an island surounded by lava, a giant desert with huge sand worms on the hunt and a truely massive demon tower looming in the background (your ultimate goal is to get into that tower). Its all connected via a HUB zone and you can freely travel back to previous areas to get goodies you may have missed like heart pieces (life shards) and bottles (vessels), haha its pretty Zelda-like but thats not a bad thing.\n\nSo, great game. Basically a mature, goth Zelda. Story isn't anything to write home about but it doesn't get in the way and the characters are all pretty awesome. 8.5/10\n\n","August 13, 2013","true","25.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You play War, one of the four horsemen … to bring devastation on the world. And, oh my, you do. Hell is loose, the angels and daemons are fighting each other and in the middle is mankind. Well, mankind: not long.\n\nSoon you find yourself tricked and are “accused” to have been showed up at the wrong time, since noone actually has called for you. You are brought before the cosmic council and you are given a second chance to remedy your “failure”. You are sent back to earth to only find out that centuries have passed since you have been trapped. You are weak and lost all your powers (and your horse). Further more, the council decided to attach an enervating spirit to you which watches every step you take. Step by step – level by level – you regain your powers and abilities back (and finally your horse too). You figure out who is behind your imprisonment and manage to take revenge. It’s a road movie in a post-apocalyptic world roamed by daemons and angels alike fighting each other … and you.\n\nThe action is pretty cool. You jump, swim, run, crawl, climb, etc. Fighting has some nice moves and as the game goes on you learn new skills and weapons. It really is smooth. The graphics are comic style nice and pretty to watch. The riddles range from easy to pretty awesome. And after learning new skills and abilities you tend to go back to levels you already cleared since you might now discover new places and spots you haven’t been before lacking the ability to fly to these places or even teleport (!). This game has looting features you get hooked on.\n\nWar is a cool character. … who is lost in a cool though confusing world.\n\nThe setting has some real nice touch. The world is filled with angels and daemons of all kind fighting each other and you’re fighting all of them. Some boss monsters are huge and some are pretty tough. Still one question remains: why I’m doing all this? What’s the point? The “mighty” council is a bundle of idiots easily fooled by a child or they deliberately sent War to prison … for what? Daemons and angels are fighting because … they don’t know what else to do? Yes, the overall action in the game is very addictive but the story could use some improvements. It seemed that some boy child fantasy has gone wild and just stopped at the point when one starts to justify all the action and reaction the characters in the game perform. “It’s there because … it’s just damn cool, isn’t it?”\n\nFinally the controls: I played with my XBox controller on PC. First it starts all nice and easy. Pretty simple and clear. But as you learn new skills, abilities and weapons you find your controller overloaded with zillions of different moves and actions you can do. At the end I felt having about ~40 different key combinations to choose from. And as such I sometimes ended up jumping and flying around before I got the right keystroke to actually hit my foe. This is simply too much.\n\nStill, a very pretty entertaining game.\n\n7/10","August 19, 2015","true","31.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ACWraith/recommended/50620/","ACWraith","ACWraith","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ACWraith/","1024 products in account","Darksiders is a reasonably good game with a bad PC port.  I suggest getting it for a console.  The camera can be frustrating (and has caused some to rage quit), but the open world action and upgrade system is enjoyable if you can tolerate a bit of grinding for resources.\n\nDon't expect this game to run well.  It will be choppy.  There will be no video settings other than resolution.  For most of my play, I had my old video card forced to display a smorgasbord of effects at 800x600.  I upgraded from a Radeon HD 3650 to a Radeon HD 7750.  The game was still choppy, but I upped the resolution and it ran just as well.\n\nDo not play this game for achievements.  They often fail to register.  If they're really important to you, make sure to save right before so you can try again.  I didn't even get my endgame achievements.  Whats worse is that the game failed to register the armor I collected.  That really hurt because it was supposed to be available on my next playthrough.\n\nDarksiders is another game that I ruined by grinding for things I don't need.  This is especially true since I didn't use anything other than a plot item in the final battle.  My weapons were fully maxed.  I finally gave up on my wrath abilities after maxing out two and getting the others one level shy.  I played in spurts over many months trying to complete chores that wouldn't even be registered for achievements.  All I had to do was warp to a location, ride my horse a bit and smack the end boss around.\n\nWhatever my complaints, I'd take Ruin over Agro any day. ;)","December 19, 2012","true","58.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

To my surprise though I liked this, more than the sequal.\nHas many clever puzzles and enjoyable boss fights that each have their own gimmic to win. It's sort of like a gorey zelda clone.\n\nThe biggest issue I had with this game, was that I constantly felt under powered. The lowest level enemies take several hits to dispatch until the end. Didn't really find myself using anything more than 2-3 moves and the default sword  the entire game. Would really of liked to see more useful unique weapons as you progressed to replace it. There are other weapons, but their usefulness is debatable.\n\nWARNING:\n1) There seems to be a bug for some, where you have to restart steam everytime you play or you won't unlock achievements. So make sure you're unlocking them as you play.\n2) Create an extra save right before collecting the final piece for abyssal armor. You'll need to load that save and recollect the final piece everytime you want to start a new game with the abyssal armor.","June 10, 2015","true","39.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Eventually following the troubleshooting guides, I did and I am very glad I took the time to do this.\n\nDarksiders was a very solid action game. The gameplay is similar to God of War and the Batman Arkham series. While the textures and character may lack detail of other games, the action is fast, the framerates are extremely high, the voice acting is superb, and the story is decent.\n\nThe combat system is interesting, at first it seems if you mash the attack button (a controller is pretty much a requirement for Darksiders), you will kill everything is sight but this quickly becomes not the case. You need to be more careful, dodge, avoid, and counter. A full frontal assault rarely works. I do prefer the Batman Free Flow combat system though and it allows for endless combos a much more fluid experience.\n\nTo finish the game game you're looking around 13-15 hours, more if you plan on exploring every nook and cranny.

The story is awesome (apocalypse, demons, angels and lots of destruction - what's not to like about that?) and the voice acting is just plain brilliant.\n\nWhile you progress through the game you unlock new combat moves, weapons and abilities - such as the ability to summon Ruin, a fiery phantom steed which makes it easier and faster to travel through the certain areals of the world.\n\nEvery areal features new kinds of enemies such as angels, zombies, spiders, ghosts and more. The bosses are slightly more challenging as they are way faster, bigger and deadlier, which requires special tactics to beat them.\n\nThe playtime (depending on your personal playstyle) is around 8-12 hours for the story. If you want to max out all weapons, find all special abilities and collect all shadow armour pieces you can easily spend 30 hours with the game.

War has a variety of moves, and the controls for the moves aren't very hard, but you still need to memorize them and be quick with your combos in order to beat some bosses and mini-games. The graphics are fine for a 2010 game, voice acting is well done, and the storyline is unique\n\nPros:\n- Unique style of combat, love to execute big bosses and big monsters.\n- Fun boss fights\n- Solid graphics, could be better\n- Good voice acting\n- Some really cool environments\n\nCons:\n- A lot of puzzles\n- The game is quite linear, if you miss an important chest, you won't be able to get it at all.\n- A couple random frame drop spots in the game.\n- Regular price of the game is hefty for an outdated game\n\nThe good outweighs the bad in this game, I'd recommend you wait to buy it when it's on sale, because it goes on sale a lot, but if money isn't an issue for you, just pick it up and play\n\n10/10 would behead demons again.","June 14, 2015","true","10.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It was one of my first Hack n Slay games that I ever played and it was sooo good and it is now. I rebought it on Steam (I bought it earlier for console) to enjoy it on my PC and besides the bad key controls (which can be overcome easily with a controller :)) it is one of the best Hack n Slay games out there. The storyline is interesting as well, nothing special but very well-implemented.\nI have nothing more to say about this game except that everybody should try it out because otherwise you would miss a masterpiece of Hack n Slay.","June 12, 2014","true","6.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/T_ConX/recommended/50620/","T_ConX","OctoChan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/T_ConX/","1356 products in account","Darksiders seems like a safe bet.  Just take the overall game design of The Legend of Zelda, then give it a God of War combat system, and the art style from World of Warcraft.\n\nUnfortunately, this paint-by-numbers approach misses the subtleties.  Zelda's charm, God of War's finesse, and Warcraft's humour are all notably absent, and this results in a game that suffers from a serious identity crisis.  It's really hard to take the games post-apocalyptic setting seriously when the visuals are just so... colourful.  It's hard to take the combat seriously when your combo library is so limited, upgrades and new attacks are so expensive, and your characters moves so slowly.  It's hard to find any charm when every character you meet is doing their best to be completely unlikeable.\n\nThe plot is stupid beyond belief.  You can tell that they're aiming to establish some deep and interesting lore here, but more often than not it just seems like they're making up the rules that govern the world as they go along.  I had trouble following certain elements, not because it was confusing, but because it was so uninteresting.  There are characters characters and concepts that are introduced in the early hours, but never revisited in the later game.\n\nThat's enough ripping on the game.  The truth of the matter is that Darksiders practically defines the 6/10.  Some good ideas, most of which are implemented well enough to make them seem interesting, but not enough to save the game from complete mediocrity.\n\nThe game's dungeons are truly Zelda-esque.  They manage good pacing between combat rooms and puzzle rooms, and the brainteasers manage to hit the sweet spot of 'not too easy, not too difficult' more often than not.  The one exception is the games final dungeon, which sees you scaling three massive towers with the help of a simplified 'Portal Gun'.  It's creative, but after clearing the first tower, it'll start to seem like pointless and tedious length-padding.  Oh, and each tower ends with the exact same mini-boss fight.  Not only that, but each of the paths towards the first two dungeons requires you to beat a series of combat challenges, some of which introduce some very immersion wrecking conditions.\n\nThe visuals are incredible.  In spite of it's grim-dark attitudes, the ruins of our civilization has some incredibly colourful locations.  Barren wastelands quickly give way to green vistas very early in the game, and the various locations each manage to maintain a different visual identity.  The levels are packed with plenty of detail, but it never gets in the way of communicating what you're supposed to interact with.\n\nOverall, the game does deserve a qualified recommendation.  If you're genuinely curious to see what a mediocre Legend of Zelda game could look like, this is it.  Dull and repetitive combat, unlikeable characters, and a moronic plot bog down what was a generally enjoyable experience.  Darksiders is at it's best when your solving puzzles in any one of it's unique dungeons, and there's just enough of that to make the entire experience worthwhile...","November 7, 2014","true","14.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The story - altho 100% linear - could come from a very good RPG, and gripped me really fast. This game should last your about 15 hours, with tons of powerups to find that extend the game length if you want to go for a 100% completion.

I suggest getting it for a console.  The camera can be frustrating (and has caused some to rage quit), but the open world action and upgrade system is enjoyable if you can tolerate a bit of grinding for resources.\n\nDon't expect this game to run well.  It will be choppy.  There will be no video settings other than resolution.  For most of my play, I had my old video card forced to display a smorgasbord of effects at 800x600.  I upgraded from a Radeon HD 3650 to a Radeon HD 7750.  The game was still choppy, but I upped the resolution and it ran just as well.\n\nDo not play this game for achievements.  They often fail to register.  If they're really important to you, make sure to save right before so you can try again.  I didn't even get my endgame achievements.  Whats worse is that the game failed to register the armor I collected.  That really hurt because it was supposed to be available on my next playthrough.\n\nDarksiders is another game that I ruined by grinding for things I don't need.

You play War, one of the four horsemen … to bring devastation on the world. And, oh my, you do. Hell is loose, the angels and daemons are fighting each other and in the middle is mankind. Well, mankind: not long.\n\nSoon you find yourself tricked and are “accused” to have been showed up at the wrong time, since noone actually has called for you. You are brought before the cosmic council and you are given a second chance to remedy your “failure”. You are sent back to earth to only find out that centuries have passed since you have been trapped. You are weak and lost all your powers (and your horse). Further more, the council decided to attach an enervating spirit to you which watches every step you take.

The story was one of the stronger aspects of the game, the combat being second. The platforming wasn't the greatest in various aspects, but it's sequel did improve on (still, screw those damn timed platforming sections because for the love of the monkey christ, you will not jump in the right direction without jumping at least 2-3 times to your death >_<.) The character and world design was absolutely fantastic, and I felt like I was running around in a Joe Madureia comic (he created Battle Chasers, his most well known work). The voice acting was pretty good, and while I love Mark Hamill to absolute death......The Watcher sounded like a constipated Joker. I don't think it was entirely Mark's fault, for all we know, the VO director could have just told him "Do a pissy Joker and let's call it a day" and that's what he did. Other than a few hiccups in the VO's where the emotion wasn't really being sold (sometimes in dramatic times they almost sounded bored), but that was few and far between. I will conclude with scores below (cause who doesn't like obligitory score systems?)\n\nCombat: 8/10\nCharacter and World Design: 9/10\nPlatforming: 6.5/10\nStory: 9.5/10\nReplayability: 6/10\n\nOverall: 8/10\n\nThis game was well done effort that deserves your time.","June 13, 2015","true","20.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

You`ll play the apokalyptic horseman war on his campaign for revenge.\nNow that sounds like an interesting plot, isnt it?\nThe Gameplay feels a lot like The Legend of Zelda, just with far more blood. You get an Advice, where to go, what to do, and who to kill, then you go on. But it wont get boring, some parts are challenging, some really easy. While playing, youll get more items, like the portal gun(ok, it has another name, but it is pretty much just like the portalgun). Some of those items will get you access to other areas, which motivates to revisit all the area (what you pretty much have to do, just before the endboss).\n\nDarksiders has not the greatest textures, but it looks great with its comic-look. I recommend a gamepad to play this game, but Keyboard an Mouse work quiet good, too. The only negative point, that i have, is that youll run a lot more than fight, which can get annoying.

The combat is somewhat repetitive owing to a limited number of weapons (just 3 melee weapons) and general uselessness of ranged weapons outside of solving puzzles, but is held up by how awesome it feels.\n\nPlently of hidden collectibles that almost directly impact your health and mana capacity, weapons can be upgraded by the means of combat, and additonal moves and upgrades can be bought from an in-game merchant.\n\nIn short, the best Zelda game that I've played, and I wholeheartedly recommend it.

There are large number of different moves the player could make, which looked a bit intimidating at first, but in the end a set of few moves is enough to get through most fights (at least in normal difficulty). All boss fights were manageable after a few tries.\n\nYes, there were also plenty of downsides. The console port is of quite poor quality. The keyboard+mouse controls work well, but the keybindings are a bit strange at first.

I suggest getting it for a console.  The camera can be frustrating (and has caused some to rage quit), but the open world action and upgrade system is enjoyable if you can tolerate a bit of grinding for resources.\n\nDon't expect this game to run well.  It will be choppy.  There will be no video settings other than resolution.  For most of my play, I had my old video card forced to display a smorgasbord of effects at 800x600.  I upgraded from a Radeon HD 3650 to a Radeon HD 7750.  The game was still choppy, but I upped the resolution and it ran just as well.\n\nDo not play this game for achievements.  They often fail to register.  If they're really important to you, make sure to save right before so you can try again.  I didn't even get my endgame achievements.  Whats worse is that the game failed to register the armor I collected.  That really hurt because it was supposed to be available on my next playthrough.\n\nDarksiders is another game that I ruined by grinding for things I don't need.  This is especially true since I didn't use anything other than a plot item in the final battle.  My weapons were fully maxed.  I finally gave up on my wrath abilities after maxing out two and getting the others one level shy.  I played in spurts over many months trying to complete chores that wouldn't even be registered for achievements.  All I had to do was warp to a location, ride my horse a bit and smack the end boss around.\n\nWhatever my complaints, I'd take Ruin over Agro any day. ;)","December 19, 2012","true","58.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Didn't really find myself using anything more than 2-3 moves and the default sword  the entire game. Would really of liked to see more useful unique weapons as you progressed to replace it. There are other weapons, but their usefulness is debatable.\n\nWARNING:\n1) There seems to be a bug for some, where you have to restart steam everytime you play or you won't unlock achievements. So make sure you're unlocking them as you play.\n2) Create an extra save right before collecting the final piece for abyssal armor. You'll need to load that save and recollect the final piece everytime you want to start a new game with the abyssal armor.","June 10, 2015","true","39.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Aside from these flaws, the game sports a fairly impressive and responsive combat system which makes taking down hordes of enemies a gore-tacular breeze, although it does become repetitive. The level design is great however, favouring a dungeon-like free-roaming hybrid over that of conventional level systems, arguably to its own benefit. The in-game collectibles are challenging to complete and offer incentives to explore, offering a reason to diverge from the story path. The voice acting is rubbish, the story predictable and the soundtrack painfully generic, although this really is a fun, long-lasting experience, eased by an expansive weapons and combo system and a lovably gothic art direction with excellent graphics. Oh and the boss battles are welcomely grand.\n\n7/10","August 31, 2012","true","24.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I'm just going to come out and say it borrows a lot from other franchises like Devil May Cry, God of War, and The Legend of Zelda and if you're not a fan of those franchises you probly won't like this. The one downside to this game is it doesn't have much of an identity of its own but it's still a pretty solid game and worth a look at if you're a fan of action adventure games and don't mind the ocasional mind bending puzzle.","August 11, 2015","true","20.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Pretty much identical to a Zelda game: Dungeons, Hearts and Containers, Souls (Rupees), and most importantly IMO the concept of using items you get in dungeons to advance through the game and kill the bosses. There's also an element of Portal later in the game as well, so if you like Portal then that is a plus.\n\nMy one main criticism is the storyline. There are 5 dungeons, and the vast majority of them involve getting the hearts of the chosen - the story really takes place during the beginning and end of the game aside from meeting Ulthane. Also, I'll mention some items are MISSABLE - particularly all items in the final dungeon.\n\nIf you like Zelda, you'll like Darksiders. If you love Zelda, you'll love Zelda.

Maybe that's also the reason why I liked it so much. This game got me captivated from the first seconds, thanks to the constant epicness of the the game universe. The gameplay is also breeze. There are large number of different moves the player could make, which looked a bit intimidating at first, but in the end a set of few moves is enough to get through most fights (at least in normal difficulty). All boss fights were manageable after a few tries.\n\nYes, there were also plenty of downsides. The console port is of quite poor quality. The keyboard+mouse controls work well, but the keybindings are a bit strange at first. The game crashed quite a few times and also features a very annoying bug where steam achievements are not registered unless you restart steam before playing the game. Running around the map also got boring towards the end.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/50620/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","In apocalyptic, biblical literature, Armageddon is usually associated with the end of life on Earth, and is represented in popular media by extreme, blockbuster scenarios. For Vigil Games' interpretation, the dogmatic themes of the source material are disassociated from the event, but familiar characters persist in their debut title, Darksiders. In Vigil's canon, the End of Days may be a catastrophic struggle between heaven and hell, but for War, one of the Horsemen of Apocalypse, it's really just a dastardly prank call.\n\nAs I already mentioned, Darksiders has you taking the role of War, one of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. In the early stages of the game, War comes out of the underworld to find the Apocalypse has taken place before it should have and mankind has been destroyed. Due to this rather monumental mistake, War has been stripped of his former power, as he is the prime suspect.\n\nWar escapes with his life due to his bargaining abilities, and his desire to discover the true cause. He's tasked with the intention of annihilating the Destroyer, who is the ruler of Hell, by The Charred Council, which are a kind of group which attempts to mediate in the war between heaven and hell. They also chain War to the Watcher, a demon that has the power to kill War if he sets a foot wrong. Fortunately for the player, the Watcher actually acts as an indication of where to go at times, or what objectives to complete, rather than simply destroying War for tripping over a ledge.\n\nThe game focuses largely on gameplay mechanics that have been tried and proven in other franchises. Zelda is a big influence here, and the way you collect pieces to level your character, as well as the at-times puzzle-heavy gameplay harks back to this. It's by no means bad, as the setting and characters are so vastly different. Another very big influence is God of War, and it certainly seems that while gamers wait until God of War 3 is released, Darksiders makes for an incredibly close experience. The controls and attacks could all be ripped directly from God of War, particularly the ability to do finishing moves on all enemies once dazed.\n\nOn top of this, orbs are collected firstly as currency, secondly as life-force, and thirdly as a form of mana allowing you to perform special magical attacks. This works extremely well though, and in some ways it feels like a large improvement on God of War, particularly in that there is less button-mashing and much more in the way of fluid attacks and movement. The balance has been struck extremely well between the puzzle and platforming action genres, and it is refreshing that exploration and puzzles take precedence over combat. They do say that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.\n\nCombat is still a very important part of the game. Ripping the heads off demons clearly is something that we can all enjoy, and Darksiders makes it difficult not to. The stunning gore effects and the fast-paced action and combo attacks are implemented wonderfully, making them for the most part easy to engage. It's made more interesting by the wonderful character models and character animations. The models are all done in an exaggerated comic book style. Enormous swords, giant armour plating, out of this world weaponry and of course dark, brooding environments.\n\nThe graphic style works very well to bring the apocalypse to our living rooms by making blood spray, and the action is highly stylised and totally befitting of the character models - in particular the giant swords. The graphics themselves look fantastic and it would be hard to wish for anything more at this stage. The movements are fluid and the attacks hit home hard. As you upgrade your weapons and find more you gain access to an additional range of combo attacks that make for even more spectacular gameplay.\n\nThe range of weapons and items in Darksiders helps to prevent things from becoming "same-old" too fast. As you roam the open-world landscape on foot or on your trusty steed you will come across item modifications which can be attached to your various weapons. These give a range of effects that will significantly help you fight your way to the deepest corner of Hell, and also allow you to customise the gameplay experience to an extent. War can always choose between a secondary and a primary weapon, both of which he can attack with at any given time.\n\nOn top of this War has access to magical attacks which he can engage provided he has enough mana souls. These are generally powerful and particularly helpful when in a bind, or surrounded by a mass of enemies. This is pretty common as the combat generally pits you against a large number of similar strength enemies, or one enormous enemy.\n\nExploring the world is made easier through the use of a steed later on in the game, and the worlds are diverse enough to keep them interesting. It's not all dreary depressing depths of hell material, with some lush forests amongst other things thrown in to keep it all interesting. The maps also allow you to experience some incredible action, for example in one of the earlier stages we got to witness an amazing battle between a dragon and a griffon, and as they battled they blasted through the ceiling of an enormous cathedral. This sort of spectacular action is largely the norm in Darksiders, and fortunately doesn’t become dull.\n\nThe open-world gameplay is certainly a big improvement over the constrained gameplay that is evident in the likes of God of War, and the increased sense of freedom makes the game fun and interesting.\n\nThe ability to save at any point in the game also helps considerably over the frustration that we often experienced in God of War when traipsing to a save point, only to die just short of it. This makes the game very functional and doesn’t overly punish the player for jumping off the edge of a cliff. In fact so long as your health is high enough falling into a lava pit will simply see you respawn with some of your life reduced.\n\nWhat is a shame however is that the developers didn’t find the time to include any sort of multiplayer. This is almost unforgivable these days, however they do redeem themselves somewhat by including some pretty in-depth gameplay statistics, even including the litres of demon blood that you have spilled. Certainly an entertaining stat to check up on every now and again.\n\nDarksiders is plagued somewhat by its copy-cat style. Fortunately the necessary improvements have been made to the known gameplay mechanics, and the context of the apocalypse certainly makes it feel all new, which is the main thing. The gameplay, environments, story and graphics are all implemented very well.\n\nHow shocked I was to find that the more hours I spent investing into Darksiders, the more rewarding it felt. Darksiders feels like a breath of fresh air, a step in the right direction and a reinvention of formulas that are sorely missed when used at this level of quality. If this is the first offering of Vigil Games, I highly anticipate their next and keep my fingers crossed for a sequel. Now all that is left is to hope that Darksiders achieves the sales it deserves, and does not suffer a silent death aside the ever loud sequel sales.","March 10, 2014","true","60.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I've played one game, Ocarina of Time on Wii's virtual console, and yet I dare to call myself a fan.\n\nFanboy, faker, whatever you say, I've been looking for good Zelda-esque games for a long time.  While Metroid and Dark Souls were certainly good (Metroid Prime especially), a game faithful to the Zelda style of gameplay hasn't appeared for me yet.  And, now I'm here.\n\nDarksiders is great.  I haven't played much of it yet, but as soon as I knew what it was, I instantly knew I had to get it.  Family Sharing wasn't working in this case for some reason (I haven't heard complaints about this, so I'll go ahead and say it was a rare case and you should be fine), but I saw this on sale with Deathinitive Edition and took the plunge.\n\nI can already tell I'm not going to refund this one.  Down to the Z Targeting and dodge mechanic, this game nails the Zelda style of combat and gameplay and from what I can tell, it even uses a semi-open world of derelict New York.  Not to mention, it throws in God of War's combat-masher style of gameplay and surprisingly it mixes well with Zelda's very dodge-roll based and item-friendly systems of gameplay.\n\nWhile this may not be a review as much of a first impressions, I have to say that it's really great so far.  Now, continue to mock me for forgetting about Twilight Princess; I deserve your mockery.\n\nOh, and one quick warning: the port isn't great.  Very limited options and obviously meant for a controller.  However, performance is acceptable (aside from some pretty bad stuttering) on my own system, and the stuttering problems disappear for some reason when using Big Picture mode for Steam.  You've been warned, get out your Xbox 360 pad and use Big Picture if you actually want to have some fun here.","April 15","true","2.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The lore is so creative and so good, the driving force for me to push into the game was to findout what was going to happen.  The story line was that good for me.  The overall gameplay I enjoyed, however there is one complaint.  It basically happens in the last dungeon, but the pace of the game drastically changes.  There are puzzles throughout the game, but the last dungeon got pretty rediculous quick.  I guess I am dumb, but I had to go to walkthroughs to finish the last dungeon.  The pace of the game drastically slowed down.  The fighting is somewhat challenging, but I personally didn't need all the various combos at your disposal.  I stuck with the very basics, and was able to beat the game just fine.  Which totally negates the point of having those.\n\nIn retrospect, they could of done things differently to make the game even better, but I will say the game as it is is very worth it.  The cliffhanger at the end of the game is just so cool.

He can also fetch other stuff.\n\nI mean, i can understand this game is not about story, but it all feels like a careless hull for the actual heart of the game: The Combat. Unfortunately the combat is not that good. After having played games like Dark Souls and DMC 3/4/Reboot, the combat is just a lot worse than all of those and just does not feel exciting imo.\nThe enemies patterns are very easy to learn and once learned you just grind down the health of the bigger enemies / bosses (the smaller enemies can be pretty much ignored.) An exception are the angels (in groups), which are actually interesting to fight because of their ranged attacks, but that does not make up for the rest. Hit-n-Run tactic almost always works.\nThe manual aim mode is too slow to be effective in combat most of the time. The weapon update system is very simplistic and once you have found your favorite weapon upgrade, thats it (you can only mount one update per weapon, though you can switch between 2 weapons and you have an offhand ability which can also be upgraded).\n\nThere are puzzles and platform elements, though neither are challenging in any way. Instead of few bigger puzzles (which i would have preffered) there are a lot of small push-that-button or push-that-box-to-climb-up or light-that-torches-to-blow-up-things type puzzles, they arent too bad i guess. The hero can climb and swim really fast, which i REALLY liked. So points for this stuff.\n\nWhen it comes to graphics (which of course are outdated by now), the overall art style fits together nicely. There is only one problem: The hero. His running looks bad. He runs like a poorly animated dwarf. This adds in making his tryhard character appear quite rediculous and out of place. Bonus points in design for these big living Rock-Portal-Blockers though. Sound is okay.\n\nTLDR:\nMediocre gamplay. The hero's way of taking anything WAY too seriously with his characteristics of an angry stone drains away a lot of the atmosphere the world could have spread and does spread in rare moments.","June 17, 2015","false","7.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

So now I'm dedicating an hour to each of these games and writing a series of One Hour Reviews. An hour isn't very long to judge a game on, so think of this as more of a first impression, and take this review in the spirit in which it's given. Be sure to read other reviews from players who have spent more time in the game.\n\nOne Hour Reviews #40 - Darksiders\n\nMy first reaction to Darksiders as I played it was that it was very reminiscent of God of War.  I don't consider that a bad thing, but it's hard not to make the comparison as you are hacking and slashing through demons.  But I think it would be a disservice to simply call this a God of War clone, as there are some differences that make Darksiders stand on its own, particularly with it's emphasis on puzzles.\n\nThe art style has a comic book influence to it, and I thought it worked well.  The only negative is a relative lack of graphic options.  You can change resolutions and set v-sync, but otherwise there are no real customization options.  This isn't a dealbreaker to me at all, and I would still recommend this game.  I'm definitely looking forward to spending more time in it.","November 1, 2015","true","1.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The game is broadly a mix of God of War and Zelda, even down to the same structure of dungeons, chests, keys and a horse, but it doesn't reach the high standards of the games it copies, and the art style and tone of the game aren't particularly inspiring either.\nHowever, it is solidly-made and usually fun. There are some frustrating bits (one in particularly where I nearly threw in the towel) but if you can forgive the unoriginality and you get on with repetitive enemy encounters, you'll probably find something to enjoy.

So you're stuck with Darksiders really. It's pretty good, the graphics are decent (I still have a feeling it lacks something, I don't know why) and the dungeons are pretty cool and cleverly made. One thing I didn't really enjoy was the God Of War-like combat. There are just too many fights (I don't mind bossfights obviously) and it just felt like button mashing all the time. What I'd rather see is an 'open' world where you can explore things, yes, just like Zelda. So, for Darksiders 2: less combat, more exploring. Give us that and it will be a brilliant game ! This is a good start nonetheless, give it a try.\n\n[Rating: 86/100]","June 25, 2011","true","14.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The seals that prevent this war have somehow been broken and thus the END WAR begins with that happening the 4 horseman of the apocalypse are summoned to end this war but not all is as it seems with only 1 horseman been summoned WAR. As you progress you learn that the charred council who are the order that brings balance are not happy and accuse WAR of causing the mayhem that has become and thus take his powers away from him that they once gave. They give him a chance to redeem himself under close guard or a guardian of the council who keeps a close watch over WAR and makes sure he does what is necessary  in order to put things right.\n\nThe story is very good and sometimes it can be a little confusing but it does well to get you back on track with the plot game play wise there are a few announces like the main map for instance it's based on the old floor style system where you bring it up and move it layer upon layer to see the floors of the area(s) should there be any. This can be annoying when finding items for some and trying to find out where to go next as there is no marker to show you the right direction, the game even on easy can be a challenge if you don't master the block system it's a timed move to slow down and get in a quick attack but when facing a lot it can be a challenge to defend against them to keep your health up. The difficulty even on easy is reversed in a way as you progress and find items to expand your health and fight for souls to upgrade weapons via EXP it gets easier but it does make it challenging with the boss fights.\n\nI had a lot of fun playing this on PS3 and the PC version runs faster with the better frame rate which make it even better to play but I would seriously recommend playing this on PC or consoles because it's worth it, but for PC users I do recommend also you use a Microsoft wired 360 controller for less hassle, I just purchased Darksiders 2 on PC as well as this and I can't wait to play it as the next horseman that is DEATH. I really do hope that they finish off the franchise with the other 2 horseman that is FURY and STRIFE","November 2, 2014","true","1.7"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

Here you have a doppelganger to a basic run-of-the-mill puzzle platformer that we've come to expect from Nintendo: levels with an emphasis on the elements, particularly lava, water, earth, desert, dark, and light, where the only way to complete each level is through a set of challenging obstacles and various enemies, not to mention the cliché "third time's the charm" when it comes to boss fights.\n\nDarksiders is a pretty solid game, it has its moments and it has its downfalls but its major defining element is its ability to deliver a well-paced experience with little tedium and monotony, as items that you collect along your journey are spread out enough to feel quite rewarding with an urge to instantly try out your new shiny device, sending you onto the next level only to stumble across another shiny device, ad infinitum. The enemies are also varied enough, and many are unique to their levels, which keeps things interesting.\n\nThere is a small amount of backtracking, which is heavily expanded on if you wish to collect every item in the game as there is a large incentive to do so. The levels are all well designed and can easily be returned to due to the prevention of the dreaded "point of no return" that many JRPG fans would be familiar with.\n\nFor me, the highlight of the game was the dialogue, simply because Mark Hamill is such a superb voice actor, as proven by his long standing career as the voice of The Joker. The sound design is pretty wicked and everything sounds as you would expect: ethereal and apocalyptic.\n\nThe only disadvantages to Darksiders are the myriad of technical issues I had, whether they be glitches with the game's mechanics or bugs preventing certain situations from progressing. One achievement failed to unlock when it was supposed to, and the game crashed no less than four times in one sitting. Twice, due to alt-tabbing and another two times simply because the game bugged out. There are very limited graphical options, sorely missing is a FoV slider as the default FoV is somewhat smothering and isn't suitable for PC standards.\n\nAnother personal parallel I can draw between this game and The Legend of Zelda is the drastic length of time it took to beat the campaign. I started playing Darksiders in September of 2011, finishing it in February of 2013. Similar to Ocarina of Time, where I decided to take a several year long break due to, you guessed it, the Water Temple.","February 17, 2013","true","28.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

So you're stuck with Darksiders really. It's pretty good, the graphics are decent (I still have a feeling it lacks something, I don't know why) and the dungeons are pretty cool and cleverly made. One thing I didn't really enjoy was the God Of War-like combat. There are just too many fights (I don't mind bossfights obviously) and it just felt like button mashing all the time. What I'd rather see is an 'open' world where you can explore things, yes, just like Zelda. So, for Darksiders 2: less combat, more exploring. Give us that and it will be a brilliant game !

Even how the texture are placed is horrible.\nThe game overall looks like an HD remake of a PSX game.\n\n♦ The Lore\nThis is the only point where i can't find a leak.\nIt's awesome.\nA tittle too slow thanks to the gameplay, but it's how games should be played.\n\n\nDarkSiders in a nutshell:\n((-Slay tons of enemies\n-Drag stuff around\n-Slay more enemies\n-Destroy stuff\n-Slay a miniboss) Repeat x10\n-Slay enemies\n-Kill a Boss) Repeat x10\n\n\nI can't suggest you to buy this game for full price, but if you like the genre very much and/or it's on sale, buy it!\n6/10","December 27, 2014","true","13.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I reminded me of the Castlevania Lord of Shadows kind of fun. Once you get used to your controls, the game is pretty good. Though you may have to resort to watching YouTube video on walkthroughs and how to deal with certain situations, it's not always obvious on what you have to do like fighting Tiamat. It's not a boring game to play since you have to go through many different places, like the desert, the water, underground sturctures, lava pits, etc... the different environments and different bosses you fight keeps things interesting.\n\nThe only downside I saw is that a few achievements that should have been unlocked, did not unlock. Could be a bug, but it doesn't affect game play. So it's up to you on how annoyed you would get by not getting an achievement you are supposed to get. Perhaps when I try on the second time around, it will unlock.\n\nI quite enjoyed it myself that I went and bought Darksiders 2. I will be playing Darksiders again in the future it was that good for me.","December 22, 2015","true","50.0"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

I will say this game still has been very fun and sorry if I didn't make that as clear in the original, this game was running the meh opinion and with only 2 options it was hard to pick but will the frustration with some of the technical issues I chose the latter. However I'll revise and give it a recommend because I was able to actually continue on and finish it.\n\n\n\nThis will be the first game I don't recommend and for good reason. While the game itself is enjoyable and awesome (makes the cons even worse really) is the fact that the game is not very stable or reliable and Im referring to gameplay stability rather than actually running the game. There are some bugs which can screw you over here and there but while playing I brushed them off, however the straw that broke the camel's back was the irreversible literal game breaking puzzle bugs. I made it as far as turning in the four hearts and was backtracking for collectibles/armor/shards etc. While doing so my character is now forever locked in the Hollows because of the train puzzle. Ther is no physical way of me leaving the dungeon now and I really didnt feel like giving up another 10hrs of my playtime to just finish the things the game had broke for me. 5/10 phenominal game, terrible pc port","November 27, 2014","true","18.9"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","2"

It's a good formula.\n\nAlthough it's 2009 release date and shoddy port still shows--there are no graphics options other than resolution and V-sync--it's still a pretty good open world RPG.

For something with such a dark theme, the game was too cartoony and colourful for me, with its rainbow demons and showers of particle effects. Every area seemed to be lit from within, with no shadows in sight.\n\nPerhaps the worst problem was the clunky controls for aiming thrown objects, using my Xbox gamepad. Combined with a unhelpful camera, it made ranged combat sections of the game more frustrating than fun.\n\nI think my teenage self might have loved this game, but the adult me wanted something a bit more straightforward, with a better told story.","July 2, 2014","false","7.3"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

The upgrades become stale and not worth the playtime at endgame.

You hit the button and it kills the enemy with a short animation.\n\nDarksiders provides about 15 hours of single-player content.I've been playing 20+ There's lots of gear to collect, weapons to upgrade, combos to learn, and special items to find.\n\nThis seems to be from the era when games were still fun\nbefore online multiplayer FPS flooded the market and  all of the Developers pumped out  mostly FPS's, I wish DEV's would return to making more games like this.\n-Anyone out there remember any cheat codes?\n\nHighly recmommended :ss13ok:\n\nːLaserBeamː ːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamː","December 1, 2014","true","24.4"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

You're gonna be playing as War, one of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. The art style is probably the best thing about this game, Joe Madureira and the team behind him did an amazing job, even though it lacks on the technical part. The only things that I didn't like about Darksiders are definitely the performance issues that I encountered while playing. Crashes, lag, controller problems, limited graphical options and some bugs. But that didn't hurt my experience very much because the game is simply amazing. I loved the voice acting (Mark Hamill, Liam O'Brien and Troy Baker) it really helps the overall atmosphere of the game and adds a lot of credibility to the characters.\nWar is one of the most badass protagonists in a video game that I've ever seen btw.\nAs I previously said, the graphics are not spectacular but the art style sometimes makes me just want to stare at the screen for a few minutes.\nThis game borrows a lot of mechanics from different games like God of War, Tomb Raider, Prince of Persia, Devil May Cry, Zelda and so on. At first I didn't really like it but about 3 hours in, I realized it does this very well and Darksiders is actually quite an unique title because of the story and the overall feeling and style of the game.\nDarksiders is an amazing adventure with a lot of really well made hack and slashing, puzzles, backtracking, platforming, even flying, swimming, searching for chests and collectibles and using your different tools/weapons that you aquire along the way.\nIt's one of my favorite games ever so I recommend it. The game took me about 17 hours on easy difficulty. Now I'm starting a new walkthrough on Apocalyptic difficulty. So basically, if you don't mind the performance issues you will enjoy this game a lot and you will definitely want to play the second one. If I'd give Darkisders a rating it would probably be a well-deserved 8.5.","September 19, 2014","true","21.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

More information on the developers can be found at the bottom of the review.\n\nIn Darksiders, you play as a hero with the name as "War". You have a sword, not just any sword, though. Your sword is an extremely powerful sword, one that can almost instantly kill any enemy you face... except the first boss. The first boss took me around 15 minutes to beat, but I'm terrible at RPG games. You're encouraged to pick up the cars he throws at you and throw them back at him. Aside from that, you end up beating the boss, but your sword loses it's amazing power. From what I can  tell from what I've played, you're primary goal is to restore your sword to it's original powers.\n\nFrom what I can tell, Darksiders is not a game for everyone. In my eyes, it's an underrated game, thanks to the release of the Dark Souls franchise\nDarksiders and Dark Souls are two very different games, but to the untrained eye, they coukd be considered almost the same game. They use the same mechanics, you die a lot, etc.\n\nFinal thoughts:\nDarksiders is a good third-person RPG experience for people looking for a good cinematic experience, and a difficult but satifying battle mechanic.\n\nOverall score:\n9.5/10, I'll be playing a lot more.\n\n\nDaeveloper's Developing Experience:\nVigil Games's first game was in fact Darksiders. They've created the entire Darksiders franchise, including all DLC.","May 11, 2014","true","1.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I'll talk about each of these briefly in this review.\n\nThe graphics in Darksiders are surely not top notch, but they have a style i personally enjoyed greatly. The enviroments are beautiful, the characters (while horribly over the top) are memorable and the soundtrack is decent. Not top notch, but good enough.\n\nThe gameplay is pretty straightforward. See creature -> swing sword at creature -> creature dies. However, in its simplicity lies its greatest weakness. Fighting enemies quickly loses its appeal, since you don't have to think about it too much. Just swing, dodge attacks from some of the stronger enemies, and you're good to go. You unlock a wealth of alternative and upgradeable weapons throughout the game, but to be honest, all of them fail to improve on what your sword already does. They are, in general, so weak that there's no point using them outside of puzzle solving. Especially once you get certain unlockables, the sword vastly outdoes anything else you'll find, adding to the tedium.\n\nNow, the story... The story actually delivers. You are War, arriving on earth to witness to apocalypse in progress, only to be called back in the middle of combat to answer for starting the apocalypse too early. What follows is an entertaining tale of betrayal and redemption (though admittedly, it does not nearly have the substance that Darksiders 2's story had, and the pacing is fairly slow until you start nearing the end).\n\nIn short, if you're looking for a game that will entertain for a week or so, Darksiders may be worth picking up.

I didn't know that the game actually takes place in modern world, I thought that it would be fantasy settings, nor I am fan of bending traditional mythology. But it wasn't that bad after all, can't say the same about Thor movie which ran on TV 2 days before I wrote this. God, it was awful and not only because of lot of lore inaccuracies...\n\nBasicly it's hack&slash with some rpg elements. You kill enemies who will kindly hand you their souls and for these you buy items, moves and few spell. Since it is a simple port UI is bit limited, there is about 6 item in game but you can only slot 3, and if you want to use different ones you have to open inventory drag them to quick-slots, which is cumbersome. Also you can't cast spell with a single key you have to use two >.< . I tried playing with the controller but I quickly came back to good old mouse&keyboard, since in my opinion it's easier to play this way, I found it hard to execute dashing attack with controller not to mention aiming is much quicker with mouse.\n\nStory is decent even though it was mildly confusing for me until certain point. Also at first I thought they used names Abbadon and Destroyer simply because they couldn't thought about more cool sounding and fitting names, since both means the same,  but that cleared up near the end of the game. But well, if it was supposed to be the twist, then it wasn't.\n\nAnyway, after my skepticism faded I had quite a good time with the game. And I can honestly recommend it.\n\nPS: Warning for achievement hunters! The game has problems with steam achievements and you may not get ones you normally should. To avoid grief, save often and if you don't get achievement, restart steam and launch the game. You have to do this every time if you want to avoid "not getting achievemnts" issue. I missed few, which normally can't be missed myself because of this.","September 28, 2014","true","42.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The story isn't awful, and the swordfighting combos feel very satisfying to execute.  There are some moments that are super-annoying (like running from giant sandworms in sand that disables your running/jumping abilities), but it's nothing completely detrimental.  All in all, a good game for the $20 value, even moreso if you catch it on sale.

I didn't know that the game actually takes place in modern world, I thought that it would be fantasy settings, nor I am fan of bending traditional mythology. But it wasn't that bad after all, can't say the same about Thor movie which ran on TV 2 days before I wrote this. God, it was awful and not only because of lot of lore inaccuracies...\n\nBasicly it's hack&slash with some rpg elements. You kill enemies who will kindly hand you their souls and for these you buy items, moves and few spell. Since it is a simple port UI is bit limited, there is about 6 item in game but you can only slot 3, and if you want to use different ones you have to open inventory drag them to quick-slots, which is cumbersome. Also you can't cast spell with a single key you have to use two >.< . I tried playing with the controller but I quickly came back to good old mouse&keyboard, since in my opinion it's easier to play this way, I found it hard to execute dashing attack with controller not to mention aiming is much quicker with mouse.\n\nStory is decent even though it was mildly confusing for me until certain point. Also at first I thought they used names Abbadon and Destroyer simply because they couldn't thought about more cool sounding and fitting names, since both means the same,  but that cleared up near the end of the game. But well, if it was supposed to be the twist, then it wasn't.\n\nAnyway, after my skepticism faded I had quite a good time with the game. And I can honestly recommend it.\n\nPS: Warning for achievement hunters! The game has problems with steam achievements and you may not get ones you normally should. To avoid grief, save often and if you don't get achievement, restart steam and launch the game. You have to do this every time if you want to avoid "not getting achievemnts" issue. I missed few, which normally can't be missed myself because of this.","September 28, 2014","true","42.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Currently still playing, I find the game way too long - one that should have ended with the defeat of Straga; yet I am still traversing all the levels again looking for the armageddon sword.\n\nHowever, there are many good things worth mentioning about Darksiders (opinions set aside) :\n- challenging game play, even on easy setting\n- tonnes of action, puzzles range from easy to difficult\n- lots of jumping and exploring\n- great graphics, especially the big bosses\n- love the premise, heaven/hell join forces to battle evil\n\nMinus :\n- camera clipping issues\n- sometimes jumps must timed right or you die - leads to frustration\n- I tried with an 360 controller, and once it is plugged in, the game will only recognize the controller.\n- would have been nice to include some rpg elements that upgraded the character instead of fight moves\n- reminded me alot of God of War, especially when climbing on the demon growth\n\n\nThe only reason why I am not recommending this game is because I am not a fan of the slasher/puzzle/jumping around type game.  If you are, then Darksiders is well worth a shot.  If not, pass this one up.","January 2, 2014","false","25.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

His name is War. A battle between Heaven and Hell is waging on earth. You are the balance, sent to earth to return the world years after the apocalypse and restore the world to its original shape. The Destroyer, who is the one responsible for the war between good and evil. You need to defeat him to stop it. The plot was vague to get ahold of in the beginning but gets clearer towards the end. Worth finishing the game for. Story rated 7.5/10\n\n* Weapons & Combat\nCombat reminded me alot of God of War. In Darksiders it was a little too much left mouse button spamming for me though. You had some abilities to attack larger groups for example. Or deal damage over time. I could live with it and play with it. The combat is brutal at times with gory finishing moves. Especially on boss fights. In the stats tab there's also the amount of demon blood you've shed, indicated with gallons. Pointless but unique and fun to show how much you've slain. But I would've love to see something like a stun attack or something that temporarily gave you a shield or strength bonus. There's a couple weapons you will unlock while progressing through the game. For fighting foes, you'll mainly use your trusty sword Chaoseater. Other weapons that you'll unlock will help you to gain access to new places where you can find health upgrades for instance. What lacked in my opinion is gear to collect that add bonuses to health, armor etc. Before realising it I already stuck alot of hours in this game and couldn't stop finishing it. I first finished it on normal and I later tried beating the game on the hardest difficulty (Apocalyptic) as fast as possible and enjoyed playing it again from the start. I had alot of fun with this game. 8/10\n\n* Graphics & Environment\nGraphics look a tad cartoonish but doesn't hurt, you're busy fighting hordes of enemies anyway instead of admiring the graphics. The thing that dragged my attention the ruins of the apocalypse that you got to see as you played through each level. I really loved the matching environment added to the gameplay and story. It was combined very well. Truly, a hell on earth. Lastly the puzzles were fun and often hard to figure out. After beating the puzzles finally, they seemed pretty easy and were even easier to memorize. 9/10\n\nOverall: 8/10[/b]","April 22, 2015","true","39.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I plan on finishing it but heres what I think so far. I think this game is great, the graphics have an art style comparable to borderlands but not quite as cartoonish. The combat can be a hack and slash but you can do that or play like I did and master moves and combos rather than spamming one combo like U probably did with GOW. The enviorments are huge which was a pleasent surprise as I expected this game to be super linear. The RPG elements are awesome you'll be buying moves upgrading buying items and buying abilities, finding upgrades and so much more. I don't want to spoil the story but so far its acceptable. HOWEVER this is a console port so there are problems with this game. DO NOT buy unless your sure your graphic card can run this at a framerate you like (my prefered is 60) there aren't any fps drops but this game besides some resolution options has no graphics options whatsoever AND DON"T YOU THINK about alt tabbing in this game because it distorts some effects like the scythe and also creates blocky shadows veryifying local gamecache did not fix this and a reinstall did. The cutscenes run in 30 fps and some textures look bad. Honestly this is a great game and if you are like me and can handle not alt tabbing and can run this game at 60fps (or whatever fps your comfortable with) than I highly recommend this game but if you just can't deal with that than either pick this up on consoles but after all the problems if you have the good fortune to run this 60fps  on PC I'd recommend that with the problems and all.","September 25, 2015","true","26.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

When I first saw gameplay all I could think was, "Oh look! God of War got a retexture!" After having actually played the game, I was simply amazed by its immersive gameplay, storyline, graphics, and its length.\nImmersive Gameplay: Very few games can actually make me scream during intense battles, but Darksiders manages to keep me on the edge of my chair (I fell out of my chair a couple times!) and even yell at the computer screen during intense battles. Darksiders gets your heart racing at speeds that should be illegal. I can't stop expressing that Darksiders makes you part of the game, and you feel every blow your character recieves and get the satisfaction of every blow he deals.\n\nStoryline: This games background story is actually rather lacking; however, I was absolutley astonished at the story that unfolds throughout the game. This is what defines a game: not knowing the history behind the story, but making the history throughout the game. The story in tandem with the beautifully crafted soundtrack, almost brought me to tears at times.\n\nGraphics: For a game released in 2010, the graphics are very mediocre. It is how the developers used them that made this game so beautiful.

This game has incredibly tedious puzzles paired up with repetitive combat. You'll come to learn that enemies lack dynamic mechanics to where it's nearly just a hack and slash and puzzle game thrown together. Throughout the game you will always find yourself doing puzzles more often than you are fighting enemies, and when you do fight enemies its the same 2 enemies reskinned. Did I mention that the story is just packed with loads and loads of puzzles? The game also gives you 5 items to do said puzzles and you will use all 5 throughout each area when you get them all. However you can only hotkey 3 of the 5 and have to go inside the ingame inventory to hotkey the other item just to have to re-hotkey the item you just un-hotkeyed to use the item you needed for the last puzzle. It had a lot of potential with story but the story just felt dragged out and the only reason why i play the game is because I feel like I'm getting closer to the end, but then they just throw in more and more paths filled with more and more puzzles. I'm 12 hours into the game and I finally felt like I was nearing the end boss when they threw in a completely new zone without ever being mentioned in the game prior and gave me a new item that lead to an incredibly boring fight and seemingly more boring puzzle mechanic. Overall it really isn't as good of a game that you hoped it to be and it I don't even want to complete the game because of how much of a chore it feels like.","January 11","false","12.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

When I first saw gameplay all I could think was, "Oh look! God of War got a retexture!" After having actually played the game, I was simply amazed by its immersive gameplay, storyline, graphics, and its length.\nImmersive Gameplay: Very few games can actually make me scream during intense battles, but Darksiders manages to keep me on the edge of my chair (I fell out of my chair a couple times!) and even yell at the computer screen during intense battles. Darksiders gets your heart racing at speeds that should be illegal. I can't stop expressing that Darksiders makes you part of the game, and you feel every blow your character recieves and get the satisfaction of every blow he deals.\n\nStoryline: This games background story is actually rather lacking; however, I was absolutley astonished at the story that unfolds throughout the game. This is what defines a game: not knowing the history behind the story, but making the history throughout the game. The story in tandem with the beautifully crafted soundtrack, almost brought me to tears at times.\n\nGraphics: For a game released in 2010, the graphics are very mediocre. It is how the developers used them that made this game so beautiful. With intense ambient occlusion and gorgeous models, this game (despite its many dark surroundings) could not be more bright.\n\nLength: This game took me about a year to complete. Its massive boss chain is a big tree. There are tons of mini bosses that lead up to semi-bosses that lead up to big bosses that lead up to the Destroyer! This game is so big! It takes hours upon hours to finally complete, and when it is finished, you feel purposless.

It really did. It had a small little cliche "Heaven v.s. Hell" kind of situation even with a cool seven seals addition. But, it seemed to have been completely lost at the fact that this game seems to be a rough copy-paste of Zelda and God of War. I see more similaritys to God of War than Zelda (I've played more God of War then Zelda) But that still doesn't excuse it. Not only does War have a similar character look to Kratos, his move set seems to be the same as Kratos'. Not to mention the same reptitive gameplay as God of War, fighting the same enemy over and over. The "Press E to do a special finiser" is taken from God of War as well. Not to mention the boss fights take after it as well. Going as far as to even use three color orbs for "Currency, Health, and Wrath" Which any fellow God of War player may have noticed from that game as "Health, Magic, and Rage". Not to mention that this wasn't exactly the best port to PC and that you'd need experience to play it with Keyboard and mouse. There's been worse, but this is still easier to play with controller. The aiming for throwing items is sloppy, and kind of hard to use. Seriously, if you want a better time and game, go buy the God of War games. Don't waste four dollars on the sale for this.","April 14","false","0.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

These and many more coupled with the occational crashes to desktop really prompted me to write this preemptive review and warn others who can't really deal with crashes.\n\nThat said, I will be finishing this game and updating my review unless the amount of crashes remain the same. Other than that, the content of the game itself is extremely well done. The combat is spectacular with the apocalyptic difficuly being reasonably challenging if not on the easier side.\n\nEdit: I've had a few crashes here and there again, but the story has picked up its pace so I'm enjoying it a hell a lot more than the middle sections of the game.","December 21, 2014","true","21.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Every once in a while things are made interesting with getting a horse or a huge cannon for a bit, and exploring hard to find areas is fun.\n\nThe puzzles are just awful late in the game.

Controller-oriented menus, few graphical options, shoddy mouse and keyboard control. With a controller, it handles decently, whereas some battles are literally impossible to complete with the mouse and keyboard controls\nIt has both fatal [CTD] and non-fatal [restart from checkpoint] bugs that are quite frustrating to say the least\nPoor level and mechanic design. These vary from small and numerous (issues with engine-based input/action/animation lag, poor mechanical decisions, getting stunlocked to death, innappropriate or inadiquate checkpoint locations, etc.) all the way to compounded and quit-worthy (I stopped when I reached a miniboss that could take half my health in one hit, did an attack that covered 95% of the arena, and would knockdown for a second or even third invariably fatal hit after the first connected)\nA feeling of "Jack of all trades, master of none," it tries to do too much. It's a combo-heavy hack 'n slash with puzzles and platforming, an RPGesque level-up system, and collectables that are actually key to survival. There is so much that you forget half of it even exists, so there were battles it took me an hour to figure out because they relied upon a mechanic I forgot about. None of the above are fully polished, and there are many hiccups, especially in the platforming and puzzling, where little to no direction is given, and the level design is not good enough to guide you through naturally.\nThis game is like a tutorial on how NOT to make boss fights. Take heed, game designers - these are inventive bosses with some of the most abysmal execution and unfair feeling losses I have ever seen in a game. They're not outright broken most of the time, they're just so unfair or punishing for the tiniest mistake that they echo the Famicom era of game design - play it over and over until you memorize it and time every move perfectly.\n\nOn the plus side:\nThe models and art, including the voice and music portions are nicely polished most of the time. Cutscenes were well done, the characters are well acted, and animations are polished.

However, this poor port from the consoles to the PC is perhaps the most damaging aspect of the game. So damaging that I find myself unwilling to endure it long enough to finish it. To start things off, a Windows update from early June of 2013 has made any video/CGI portion of the game unbearable. The top half of all of these sequences is nothing, but black. While many are quick to blame MS for this bug, I am not. The reason being that every single game I own, older and newer than Darksiders, is unaffected. Only Darksiders is affected, which leads me to put most of the blame squarely at the feet of the now defunct developer. And the grand-daddy of them all are the controls. They are downright terrible for the PC version. In the beginning you can easily manage to customize your mouse and keyboard in a way that makes the controls bearable, but as you progress throughout the game and gain new abilities you will find yourself agonizing over trying to find a new way to customize you controls all over again in a way that will work. Also, Steam offers only partial controller support for the game, so the only way to use one effectively is the tedious programming through a third-party program. Perhaps if the gameplay was a little more in-depth rather than hack and slash then it would be worth it to put up with these flaws. Alas, it is not. Other features that seem to be lacking is the freedom to move around the world, and the lack of an expansive world at that. I never finished the game, but considering that the game is just only 12-15 hours long, and that I got a quarter of the way through it, I would think that it would begin to open up in some more ways. If it does open up later then I doubt you will have much time to delight in it. There are some bright spots, however. Much of what this game takes after is The Legend of Zelda franchise. The puzzles, the dungeon-like settings, and whatnot are all there. But the game doesn't do much else to differentiate itself in a positive fashion. The puzzles are too simplistic (much more than the recent 3-D Zelda games), and the world is not nearly as expansive as Twilight Princess or even Ocarina of Time. It may sound unfair to compare Darksiders to the granddaddy of all adventures franchise, let alone Ocarina of Time, the highest rated game in video game history. But if one is to compete then they must offer something exclusive or something better. The only areas where it pulls it off is the secondary-attack weapons. But other than that there is nothing but cheap QTE-like finishing moves, and tons of blood to cover-up its obviously dated gameplay, even for the standards of 2010 (the year of release). The lack of decent controls on PC, the video problems on PC, the dated mechanics, and the lack of an open and compelling world doomed this game from potential greatness to okay.","July 26, 2013","false","4.6"," 9 of 20 people (45%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","45","9","20","0","4"

Some enemies are cannon fodder, others are borderline minibosses and having both extremes does not make it the nice middle.\n\ni won this for free. and i kind of regret it.","July 20, 2013","false","2.8"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

Clunky controls, limited graphic options, often awkward camera and my personal favorite a dead mouse. Obviously this port was made for quick cash in.\nYou will run into a technical problems. Once you try to turn on the game it welcomes you with black screen which requires you to delete some files from game directory or restart steam. Achievements won't unlock until you restart steam and you are never certain if you are going to unlock them or not. Save file might dissapear when you're half through a game.\nSound freezes for no reason durring cutscene.\n\n\nOther than technical failures it feels like some soul-less executive in a expensive suit came into a game dev office, ditched five most successful games over last 5 years and ordered to frankenstein it together because it's guaranteed to sell. It doesn't have soul of it's own and often feels stale and boring compared to other games. It rips off portal, god of war, legend of zelda and adds nothing new.\nIt'll fit perfectly in my buyers remorse category.","February 21, 2015","false","10.3"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SunderMK2/recommended/50620/","SunderMK2","Sunder MK2","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SunderMK2/","126 products in account","A great story, with good characters, almost ruined by a game.\n\nI want to love this game.  The story is engaging, I keep saying 'I want to know what happens next.'  You are a horseman of the apocalypse, which for some reason in the universe of this game are the guardians of the balance between heaven and hell.  Well someone messed that up, destroyed all mankind, and framed the rider War for screwing everything.  You are War, find the party responsible, make them pay.  Lots of twists and turns on that path, you'll honestly like a few demons, give others the finger, and laugh with glee while gunning down angels.\nThe visuals are impressive, remember all the World of Warcraft art with all the highly detailed armor?  Remember how that game looks nothing like that art?  This one does.  This looks like that.  This is the game that wanted to be visually.  Very pretty to look at, glorious in motion especially on PC without any framerate loss.\n\nThere are two problems.  First, they decided they wanted to make a puzzle platformer.  Wonderful bits of swordplay are interrupted by seriously overly long puzzle sections of tedius boredom.  Hope you like backtracking!  Seriously, you are forced to backtrack an absurd amount, and sometimes the path to where you need to be gets very confusing.  Prepare for lots of frustration before you get to the next stabby bit.\n\nSecond, they decided they wanted to add tons and tons of stuff.  We're talking hey!  Giant sword!  Cool, now give him a killer boomerang thing!  Awesome, but how about a gun?  Can we give him a gun?  Awesome!  But you know every good hero has a grappling gun, give him one of those!  Coded!  Great!  Now hey... There's this game called portal, maybe we should play with portals too?  BAM!  Portal gun added!  Sooo....  Let's drop the bass, give this guy a literal warhorn too!  A little odd but, done!  Now quests for collectables that require backtracking to every single game section after you acquire all this stuff!  Not to say how annoying it is to try to use it all in combat.\n\nThe controls are a little iffy, the camera likes to do perspective changes while you are trying to do percise platform jumping, which is a bit maddening.  Thankfully the game is very forgiving of the inevitable falls into endless pits, a small health penalty and puts you right back where you were this time knowing what the camera is about to do to you mid jump.  For the non platform sections?  Controls work fine.  With two exceptions.\n1.  The game really needs a 360 controller.  The complicated mess of all the STUFF they want you to do is incredibly awkward on a keyboard.\n2.  The range weapon controls are beyond terrible.  Going into aim mode makes you turn slower than molasses, and you need to hit things moving at full speed.  Makes you very thankful to get back to bashing things with your giant sword.\n\nThen there is the purchase new combos option, which most tend to fall into two categories.  Too time consuming and or difficult to trigger mid combat, or way too easy to tigger mid combat so you're always going moves that take you in a direction you didn't want to go.  Thankfully the devs made the game smart enough not to let you fly off a cliff because you were doing a combo.  So go for the ledge fights, just keep well clear of the jump button.\n\nOne more note is stability.  The windows port is known for crashing.  But there is no pattern to this, all gamers report crashes at different spots with really no perdictibility.  In my experience I've had something like 6 game crashes in 13  hours.  I would say 3 were alt-tab related.  I also had a 4 hour flawless session that spawned multiple levels.  So be prepared, you will lose progress time to time.\n\nThe recommend yes/no system is a bit too limiting, I'd put this game at 75%.  Not enough to tell everyone to go get it, but if you want lots of puzzles with your hack and slash then pick it up.","June 10, 2015","false","24.0"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

If you were to look at my profile you'll see I'm over 40 hours playing it.\n\nSo why the negative review?  One huge flaw:  The game has some magor bugs.  Bugs like sometimes acheivements don't get unlocked.  IF YOU ARE AN ACHIEVEMENT HUNTER DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.  PERIOD.  It is incredibly frustrating to play hours of a game hunting for all the acheivements to find all that work was useless due to some bad programming.  In my experience, about 50% of the time the achievements do not unlock.  50%!\n\nIf you're lucky and you had some previous save files so you can go back and spend an additional couple hours hoping that the acheivement will unlock on your second time around.  If you don't have an old save file, back to a new game for you.   Wonder why I'm at 40 hours on a game that should have been about 20?  Replaying the same things hoping this time the acheivement will get unlocked.\n\nI NEVER write reviews but this game is so frustrating that I had to write one to warn people.\n\nAgain: IF YOU ARE AN ACHIEVEMENT HUNTER DO NOT BUY THIS GAME\n\nHoping for an update to fix those bugs?  Don't hold your breath since the company that made these games is now out of business.\n\nIf you don't care about achievements than this is a great game in the style of God of War.  Play at your own risk.","July 25, 2015","false","47.6"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

Within the first five minutes killing angels by throwing cars at them? AWESOME!\n\nWhat I got to play of it was very entertaining and exciting. The combat was a blast. The visuals for its age, were dynamic.\n\nThen I came across a jumping puzzle and while I know *how* to do it--I *cannot* do it. The dexterity required was beyond my capabilities even when I tried with k/m which is difficult for me. To be clear, I can get by in Batman games and suchlike so it is plausible for devs to tame this down on easy mode.\n\nOn "easy" mode [I test all games on that] the platforming puzzles do not scale down in relation to the difficulty, or scale down enough in difficulty. The combat does--the precision required to do those puzzles does not. I tried this specific puzzle more than 200 times and could not do it.\n\nI recommend this game IF you are not cognitively or physically struggling. It's lots of fun, for what it is.\n\nI cannot however, recommend it for anyone with challenges due to the precision nature of some of the jumping sections unless you want to frustrate the crap out of yourself. I'm still stuck at that broken down church and the rest of the game is now unplayable for me.\n","July 19, 2015","false","13.2"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

Besides aiming mechanics and perspective it has everything up to and including chests, grappling hook, bottles, masks and even a shadow Link battle. In that regard it's pretty fun.\n\nHowever this is an almost stereotypical crappy PC port. Random slowdown, cutscene skipping, horrible default keybindings and little room to customize them as well as other scattered bugs. Despite annoying me greatly I was still able to push through it and had many good moments. Which is why I'm not thumbing it down. Just keep in mind that you'll be seeing a lot of stuff in the vein of the following video I made.\n\nAlso, this comes with a comic and complete OST. The game takes it upon itself to install these things to your main partition without asking you though. I enjoyed the comic. It's pretty cheesy but then so is the game. I'm also a sucker for supplemental material like this.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFtyhLyg27s","January 28, 2015","true","19.7"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

It's not a terrible game, but it's pretty tedious.\n\nFirst off, the story is intriguing enough.  I kinda wanted to know what happened.  Though the characterization is pretty weak.  Just about every character is a 1-dimensional ultimate badass type except the merchant, it's not horrible but not exactly great either.\n\nThe combat is reasonably entertaining.  There are basically two types of monsters so far, the ones you can hit stun, which you pretty much just beat up and are harmless, and the big ones you can't hit stun, which you dodge->hit->dodge-> hit.  Again, not terrible, not great either.\n\nAs with all over the shoulder console games, the camera pretty much follows behind you.  Hence to keep the camera focused on the big mob you need to dodge you have to hold L2/left trigger.  Personally find holding that button extremely awkward and wish the camera lock was a toggle, however there's pretty much no options in terms of changing controls.  Not a deal breaker, but annoying.\n\nThe platforming, wall climbing and switch hitting is tedious to the max.  Here's a room I just finished, slide down a rope, hit a switch, jump across 4 platforms, throw your batarang at a switch, jump across 2 more platforms, batarang switch, jump 2 platforms, grab a bomb, blow a thing up, jump some more platforms, batarang switch, jump more platforms, jump into a room, grab the "grab here" effect on the wall, go across the wall, grab a rope, climb across the rope, get a key, hit a switch, jump some more platforms, hit a switch, jump 4 platforms, batarang switch, jump more platforms, into a room, batarang switch, jump out of the room back to the key hole to place the key.\n\nI'm sorry but that's not fun, that's a lot of busy work.  There's nothing in this game fun enough to compensante for tedious time wasters like that.\n\nWorst of all is the controls for aiming ranged attacks.  Absolutely brutal.  I was using a gamepad as this is clearly a console game but I have read the mouse is no better even for the ranged attacks.\n\n6/10","July 9, 2014","false","4.5"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Not only can you not play it at a higher resolution but you must disable every security feature which include any active anti-virus, maleware protection and your firewall. It doesn't matter what your computer specs are there are no way to alter or reduce the demand of physical memory this game allocates to your system. In some cases if your save game file becomes too large it won't load, if you stop in a spot right before a boss fight and enter, it will freeze. If you try asnd summon either the watcher or Ruin your steed, it will freeze at times. This game is far too buggy and I regret buying it in the first place and of course it seems that steam is in no hurry to make any fixes to their products, as usual. So you can forget a fix in the future at any rate and the developers are under a new name and most likely will not provide any support for this game as it is a only a few years old.","August 28, 2014","false","31.5"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

It's not a terrible game, but it's pretty tedious.\n\nFirst off, the story is intriguing enough.  I kinda wanted to know what happened.  Though the characterization is pretty weak.  Just about every character is a 1-dimensional ultimate badass type except the merchant, it's not horrible but not exactly great either.\n\nThe combat is reasonably entertaining.  There are basically two types of monsters so far, the ones you can hit stun, which you pretty much just beat up and are harmless, and the big ones you can't hit stun, which you dodge->hit->dodge-> hit.  Again, not terrible, not great either.\n\nAs with all over the shoulder console games, the camera pretty much follows behind you.  Hence to keep the camera focused on the big mob you need to dodge you have to hold L2/left trigger.  Personally find holding that button extremely awkward and wish the camera lock was a toggle, however there's pretty much no options in terms of changing controls.  Not a deal breaker, but annoying.\n\nThe platforming, wall climbing and switch hitting is tedious to the max.  Here's a room I just finished, slide down a rope, hit a switch, jump across 4 platforms, throw your batarang at a switch, jump across 2 more platforms, batarang switch, jump 2 platforms, grab a bomb, blow a thing up, jump some more platforms, batarang switch, jump more platforms, jump into a room, grab the "grab here" effect on the wall, go across the wall, grab a rope, climb across the rope, get a key, hit a switch, jump some more platforms, hit a switch, jump 4 platforms, batarang switch, jump more platforms, into a room, batarang switch, jump out of the room back to the key hole to place the key.\n\nI'm sorry but that's not fun, that's a lot of busy work.  There's nothing in this game fun enough to compensante for tedious time wasters like that.\n\nWorst of all is the controls for aiming ranged attacks.  Absolutely brutal.  I was using a gamepad as this is clearly a console game but I have read the mouse is no better even for the ranged attacks.\n\n6/10","July 9, 2014","false","4.5"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Having to go to college though required me to leave my xbox behind, so when I saw that this was on sale for  super cheap it was a no brainer to get this game. For the first part of the game I didn't really have problems with the game (except for the camera being pretty crap), but that all changed when I first got into a fight with a tougher enemy and kept getting my ♥♥♥ kicked. The problem being is that the controls are awful. It feels awkward trying to hold alt and move around to dodge enemy attacks, and the same goes for using special abilities. Which require you to hold CAPS LOCK and press 1-4. I also had a few times when I would enter a new area I would just fall into blackness, because the area didn't finish loading in the time I booted up the game and kicked through the door. The game also crashed on me twice so far. Once when I was right about to exit the game, and a second time in a middle of a dungeon. With all that being said I still personally love the game, but the PC version is just terrible compared to the console versions, so if you have a choice between the two get the console version. The controls just work better on it, and I never experienced falling into black pits of nothingness.","November 5, 2014","false","29.6"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Starting off with the good, it has a cool plot, and an interesting setting. It takes a twist down "Apocalypse Lane" as it were, but with a biblical/fantasy twist.\n\nThe game is a mish mash of every action adventure game out there, heavily influenced by games like Zelda, God of War, Prince of Persia etc. In typical THQ fashion there is nothing original about the gameplay but I do not hold that against the game.\n\nThe one inexcusable, frustrating, made-me-brake-my-spacebar-fault is the controls! They are abysmal and unintuitive which really hurts a game like this. I played on this highest difficulty, and the controls caused me to die more than the game itself. And I am not whining about hard to pull off combos, even basic things like aiming/locking on to targets is unecessarily complex and annoying. Having to press and hold five different buttons to ride and shoot simultaneously is just stupid. I also looked at review for the consoles and apparently they are no better.\n\nOne good thing about the game is that the challenge is there, the hardest difficulty available to me at the start is what I chose and I did have my ♥♥♥ handed to me many times. The character design is also very well done, and the game has its own style. Kudoes for that.\n\nAll in all this game is a pit stop amidst the ongoing journey of a action adventure game fan, and is nothing to write home about. It has a lot of issues but manages to be enjoyable despite that.\n\nTL,DR: A mediocre title, worth buying if you get it on a sale else don't bother.","November 8, 2014","false","20.0"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Puzzles, while plentiful and occasionaly good, are tedious and unforgiving. At some stages camera angle is locked in place and limits your view which can be very frustrating.

It's a console port, guys.\n\nDarksiders is a game that wears its inspirations on its sleeve famously, and to a ridiculous degree. When you're traveling through a Legend of Zelda-style dungeon solving puzzles with a Portal Device, you know you're not playing a game that's focusing on being particularly innovative.\n\nThat's fine, it doesn't do it does particularly well though.\n\nThe dungeons, level design wise, are all threadbare. Puzzles never get more complicated than "get past the obstruction using the item you got in that dungeon", platforming reaches its maximum amount of complexity 20 minutes into the game, and exploration is limited because despite the expansive levels, there's very few optional areas. You're taken in a very roundabout, but ultimately linear, path and led by the nose from start to finish.\n\nCombat doesn't fair any better - it has all the tools to play well, but the way it's executed is an absolute mess. Even the Counter, the quintessential "up yours" high-risk high-reward move that's been a staple of decent hack n slash games for over a decade, will often be cancelled and interrupted because it doesn't interrupt a good deal of enemy attacks - seemingly at random.\n\nThe moveset cops a lot of flak for its simplicity, but once you unlock the full movesets for each weapon and supplement each weapon's combos with another weapon (you can even switch out your sidearm and combo them into each other) you can get a nice amount of combat variation going on.\n\nDesign doesn't support that, though, since the game has the a conceptually moronic weapon leveling system that strongly discourages using more than one weapon - the difference between weapon levels is more than just palpable. Add to that that combos have no impact on anything whatsoever.\n\nAt its best, it plays like a more forgiving Devil May Cry, but mostly it plays like a more brainless God of War and it suffers for that heavily.\n\nThe whole lack of finesse seeps into every corner of the game. They're terrified you'll play it wrong, or will look in the wrong direction for more than a second - puzzles will constantly be interrupted by those infuriating drawn-out mini-cutscenes which point out what you're meant to do, the Watcher is used as a device to call your attention to something that's already flashing, and many more examples. One particularly egregious example has you explore a small environment for four challenge portals, that as well as having icons on the map and having giant beams shoot up into the sky, even have Eye of Sauron-like icons on top of the beams just to be extra sure that you don't actually have to explore.\n\nDarksiders has all the tools and capability to play well, but it adamantly refuses to.\n\nOn a more positive note, the environments are absolutely fantastic, I was personally fond of the character design  - despite my usual complete distaste for giant pauldrons - due to just how well done it is, and it has some of the best flashy particle use I've ever seen.\n\nWar as a lead is bland, but he isn't antagonizing or unlikeable. The supporting cast is similarly lacking in character but inoffensive (with the exception of Samael and the Watcher, who were both pretty enjoyable). The story isn't particularly interesting, but isn't grating.\n\nIt's an incredibly pretty game (despite the very noticeable lack of anti-aliasing in a game with so many sharp edges), and if you're looking for a stylish hack n slash and are willing to overlook a few design issues that drag it down, then check it out.\n\nI wouldn't outright recommend it to anybody that isn't looking for that particular type of game, though.","November 14, 2014","false","29.5"," 20 of 43 people (47%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","47","20","43","2","5"

Ultimately my sentiments would lean more toward a neutral response, but "not recommended" captures my intention more than recommended does. I wouldn't recommend this game, not because it's a bad game, but because it's not a good game. It's mediocre. It may appeal to people who thought Zelda was too difficult, but that's about the extent that my recommendation goes.\n\nUltimately the biggest problem with the game is that it's way too easy. I played it on normal mode, so naturally I don't expect the monsters to be anything special, but that's not the kind of difficulty that I'm talking about. I mean that the puzzles are way too easy and the dungeons are way too linear. Perhaps I shouldn't compare it too much to Zelda, but that and God of War seem to be what most people compare it to. I can definitely see the inspiration of Zelda on the game, but they've dumbed that down into only a handful of dungeons that are extremely simple to navigate through and beat. There are a couple of decent puzzles that leave you with a sense of accomplishment, but once again comparing it to the quality of Zelda, it leaves something to be desired.\n\nMost of these easy puzzles are accomplished by gimmick weapons that are found in the dungeon that you'll find yourself using it the most. Generally these weapons serve little practical purpose outside of the dungeon they're found, though there are a few exceptions. One such gimmick item is one that greatly resembles the gun from Portal. When I first saw it I thought "awesome, I can portal around everywhere now. What a great idea!" But unfortunately that excitement was stifled by the realization that you can only use the gun on a handful of orange circles. It was kind of cool going around with it, but they overused the gimmick in the dungeon to the point that it felt tedious, and they only used it a couple of times outside of the dungeon to get little secret items. The horse, Ruin, was also like this. The horse was cool when you could use him, but War is limited to using the horse in only certain areas. I had hoped that a game about a horseman would feature more horse, but the game is pretty close to the end by the time you even get him.\n\nThe power glove item that lets you smash the blue crystals was neat since you could use it as a weapon, but it really wasn't that great of a weapon either. For the most part I found myself only using the sword and the crossblade (the boomerang) in battles, and the latter was still pretty weak, but could help subdue certain enemies. I almost never used the wraith skills (though they may prove more helpful in Apocalyptic difficulty). The chaos form was pretty helpful, though perhaps it made the game too easy.\n\nThe story is one of the areas where the game does shine. I don't want to give too much away, but it is pretty unique, and perhaps it's the only thing I really liked about the game. The characters are decent and likeable too, though admittedly the names can be a little confusing at first. The swordplay isn't bad either, though it can be tedious at times. Maybe I had an issue with this because I never used my wrath items or other weapons, but the sword just worked better than the rest of them. Your character controls a lot like a character from World of Warcraft, which works pretty well. I only have two gripes with the movement. The first is that when you're targeted onto a character and you use your dash move, it moves your character relative to the screen rather than relative to your character. This leads to your character darting toward an attacking enemy rather than dashing to the side periodically. It would have been more intuitive if it had been done relative to the character. The second gripe is that the horseplay can be a little clunky as well, though this is a relatively small problem.\n\nThe game suffers from bugs as well. Perhaps this is more situational to the player, but during my runthrough of the game it crashed between five and ten times. It wasn't super bad, but it was highly annoying. Additionally, sometimes when you're climbing on that demonvine stuff and you want to jump to another piece, it won't let your character do it, and you have to try again. Similarly, often after you land one such jump your character will be stuck there unable to move. Another glitch I ran into is that often when you try to summon your horse, it will summon him for a second and then your character will immediately unsummon him, which can be pretty annoying. One final bug that I noticed was that sometimes the music would  partially cut out and the game would sound hollow. A restart fixes this, but it's still annoying. These bugs may just be limited to a few people, though, so I don't necessarily calculate them into my real recommendation, but they're worth noting.\n\nExploration felt pretty shallow. There were some neat areas to explore, like one area called the Drowning Pool, but for the most part there wasn't much to explore since the game is so linear. A lot of the exploration in the game relied on going back to old areas with new abilities, which was kind of tedious since it relied on backtracking rather than new challenges. It was kind of cool opening up old areas, but if you don't remember exactly where they were, then you have to go through the whole ordeal of the dungeon again, which proved to be banal, though the puzzles were precompleted by you. At least there was some sense of exploration, but as I said, what was there felt shallow.\n\nThe soundtrack to the game is fine too. Nothing to get too excited over, but not necessarily bad either. Just fine. And the game could have expanded more on a certain subplot featuring a certain dapper undead, too. At least it was there at all, but the game didn't really do anything with it. It could have been awesome, but it was just left there uncompleted.\n\nAll in all the game isn't necessarily a bad game, but there's nothing to make it good either. I was expecting more given all of the great reviews. I'd officially rate the game as average: okay, but nothing special. I wish Steam gave a "neutral" button when deciding how to rate the game, but "not recommended" is the better choice of the two recommended options. Cheers.","January 15, 2014","false","29.2"," 6 of 15 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","6","15","0","2"

Basically, you mash the Attack button, and... that's about it. Your character's weapon is a huge 2-handed sword, but it doesn't even feel like it has weight, which makes combat feel unsatisfying. Slash weapons should be fast and interesting to use. Slow weapons should feel heavy but powerful, and every hit should be satisfying. It's not the case here. You can dodge, but it's really only useful during boss battles, which are usually just the same boring pattern 20 times. You can collect souls and buy things with them, but it kind of feels out of place and breaks the flow even more. A simple Skills or Upgrades menu would've been better. Also, I don't think there's any music in this game... and the visuals are a bit bland.

There are 2 aspects of the game which I think Vigil did right, and that is the sound (voice acting and music) and the art design. Both are well polished and interesting. War looks like a real badass and sounds like one too.\n\nBut this game is a 'hack and slash' so the combat should be the main focus, and this is where I felt the game fell short. It felt clunky and slow to put it bluntly. Blocking is extremely awkwards because the put the same button to block as they did dash when you're moving in a direction. So when trying to block you more often than not dash, which can result in you getting hit. And I hate getting hit. Juggling also ties into blocking with how enemies behave. Small things like a certain grunt enemy (which are plentyful) do a ground bash that somehow also hits you in the air, which it honestly shouldn't (I mean, it is a ground attack), causing you to lose your juggle as well as being unblockable. The lock-on system and free aim systems are both awful. When locking on it changes your camera angle so you frequently can't see what is behind you and it is also awkward trying to change between targets. Free aiming is exponentially worse. It is difficult to describe in words, but the aiming is slow, clunky, awkward, and so frequently used it makes for a terrible gaming experience. What's more is that parts when you have to hit something with your projectile weapons is made that much harder because the game forces you to use the free aim controls, instead of just locking on to what you need to hit. I think this is unecessary to the overall experience of platforming.\n\nManouvering the game world is also a chore in my opinion. Darksiders is a hack and slash, and world design in such games needs so be concise and straight forward, or in other words somewhat linear. Backtracking or having an open level design is fine, exemplified in Devil May Cry 4 for example. But Darksiders has a world designed more like and RPG than the traditional hack and slash and it is painful trying to navigate it. War moves rediculously slow, especially when you're just trying to move from A to B in a big, open space. Moving from area to area is more bearable with a quicktravel system, but that involves War walking from one portal to another in some ethereal space. It takes 2 minutes but it is rediculously tedious. There is absolutely no need for it.\n\nMy verdict is that if you can pick up both Darksiders I and II for 10 bucks or less, you can do worse for your money. But small nuances in the gameplay degrade the overall experience too much, and I believe if you want a better hack and slash game you should play Devil May Cry 4 or earlier (not DMC).","December 19, 2013","false","19.8"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"

The battle animations are cool and I always love to see games with strong art direction. Darksiders has been compared to Zelda and I would say that for the most part, that's a decent comparison. There are temples with puzzles and new weapons to collect and a big boss to fight at the end. It's a good formula.\n\nBut my problem with this game is that it's gratuitous. After slogging through one too many arena-style battles featuring wave after wave of enemies... it got old. I just wanted it to end. The level of violence in this game is pretty gruesome, and going into this game, I knew it was a stretch for me. Maybe some people get a thrill out of splitting enemies in half or ripping the wings off of angels, but again, this got tiresome and trite pretty quickly.\n\nIt also doesn't help that virtually every character in this game is some gravel-voiced dude whose character motivations, if they even exist, are hidden behind in-game fantasy jargon. It's been a while since I've played, but from what I remember, they have special names for all kinds of eternal creatures or gods or places, and after a while, I started forgetting who was who and why I should care. Most of the cutscenes could be summed up with "listen to this deep-voiced guy say cool words." If it wasn't that, it was "watch this super muscular guy graphically slice up some enemies."\n\nSo if this what a Westernized version of Zelda looks like...

It becomes really boring and I just know that new area == more boring puzzles... I really hate that, I recommend them do one play trough of the original DMC1.\n\nJoe, this was a nice try and I hope you succeed with the upcoming Battle Chasers game.","April 13","false","16.2"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","20","1","5","2","0"

The combat is fun and does not rely too heavily on button mashing. The dodge There is a degree of skill needed to take down more powerful enemies without getting repeatedly killed or losing all of your health after one fight. The story isn't the most captivating, but it properly sets the tone and applies context to all of the action. Lastly, the art and design for this game are also excellent, evoking the fantasy of this realm. All of these factors should have combined to make a great game, but the frustrating puzzles are holding this game back.\n\nThe puzzles in this game are annoying for two reasons: they frequently involve backtracking through old areas rather than exploring new areas, and they ruin the action oriented pacing of the game. I try to avoid the Zelda comparison when talking about this game, but I can't help feel that Zelda is infinitely better at what this game is trying to do; particularly when it comes to blending the combat and puzzles. In Zelda, the combat is low-key, slow-paced and requires more decisive and timed hits (like a puzzle itself), so the puzzles keep the pace going evenly. This is different from the action heavy button-mash beatdown of Darksiders. There is nothing wrong with button-mash beatdown as a gameplay mechanic, but when I'm forced to take it slow and do a tiresome puzzle, what should be a healthy challenge becomes a tedious roadblock in my fun.\n\nWriting this review made me sad because this game has a boatload of potential that was crippled by obnoxious puzzles. I don't recommend this game because the puzzles were more frustrating than the game was fun. If looking up a walkthrough isn't an assault on your pride then go ahead and get Darksiders, however there are not a lot of good ones for this game. As a closing note, I can't recommend this game, but parts of it were enjoyable enough for me to wonder if the sequel is better.","July 2, 2014","false","22.9"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

Save your money and time.\nThe story is quite confusing, first you spawn on a street and just start fighting enemys for no givin reason, then your in hell for some other reason and then a demon comes into the main characters arm.\nThe combat consists of just clicking or just running away but sometimes you can do a finishing move which is not that great. There is huge powerful creature you can turn into but you can only turn into it at the beginning of the game and I tried to turn into it at boss battles but it wouldn't let me.  There is one part in the game where it tells you to kill 500 enemies in a small space so basically you end up wasting your time finding a ton of enemies then killing them then you end up getting rid of them.  The last thing I want to say is the wings in the game.  When I first got them after I beat a boss I thought I could fly but they only allow you to jump more.  So overall you shouldn't get this game.","March 3, 2014","false","1.8"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"
