Linden Shades was an orphanage that was abandoned because a mysterious figure in red was scaring everyone. Nobody took the headmistress seriously when she had proof of a malevolent act. Now, it's time to set up the truth...\n\nI must say that I was quite happy to see this game arriving on Steam, because days before of its release, I added its profile on Neoseeker. I didn't really knew about Eipix, the developer, but they were given some known series on Big Fish Games, which is a hint about their quality.\n\nThe story is very-well written. I didn't really expect some twists of the story but the most shocking truth is in the bonus chapter. It's reminding me of an Artifex Mundi game (well, at least, those they've developed).\n\nThe gameplay is the same as any casual adventure: you find item, you use them, you clear hidden objects scenes and you solve puzzles. The good thing here is that the objects are easy to find. And you have even some items to assemble (like a box of chocolate, dominoes, etc..). As for the puzzles, they're easy apart for some of them that I skipped - but only because I knew about the ingame achievement of skipping five puzzles. Another good side is to find special items: pencils in each location, toys and letters (which are used in the menu itself!).\n\nThe graphics are quite good, even if the characters look weird in the dialogues. However, I like the cutscenes: real people were acting (and they're members of Eipix according to the making off included in the game) and it was very nice, even if the headmistress in the movie doesn't really look like the drawings when listening to her tapes.\n\nThe soundtrack is also very good, while not really fitting. But well, I enjoyed that part.\n\nThe bonus are also interesting: BTS (behind the scenes), a making of, wallpapers, music, hidden objects scenes and puzzles, the bonus chapter, even the trailer of the game.\n\nOff the Record: Linden Shades is one of the best casual adventure games you'll find on Steam, with those from Artifex Mundi. And it has the same quality as what you can find in Artifex Mundi's catalogue. In other words, everything is reunited to pass an agreable moment. However, I think that it would be great to have Steam achievements and trading cards, not for being more popular but because the game has potential for good smileys and epic success.","May 25","true","4.7"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","12","12","0","0"
