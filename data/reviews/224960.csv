And all those 90's kids who played Tomb Raider back in the days just can't forget how they felt being this badass curvy version of Indiana Jones, roaming the caves, jungles and deserts by themselves, desecrating temples and tombs with two guns as best friends. Of course, the game seems way too easy now, the graphics are terrible and Lara has never been less attractive but to live once again these sensations, the thrilling chills when the t-rex appears, the little screams every time you fall into one of these traps you could have sworn you knew by heart, a good old merciless cold-hearted heroin who doesn't give a damn, now that's freakin' priceless!","January 10, 2014","true","70.3"," 50 of 51 people (98%) found this review helpful","98","50","51","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/synthsequence/recommended/224960/","synthsequence","synthsequence","http://steamcommunity.com/id/synthsequence/","442 products in account","What else can possibly be said about one of the most famous video games of all time?\n\nGraphically, yes, by today's standards the low polygon count (dem triangle boobies) and the square-based geometry is laughable, but back in '96, this was top-notch. Levels and textures are repetitive, though, especially caves and the like. Funnily enough, Lara's house and Natla's mines, two of the least "tomb-like" areas in the game provide the most variety and definitely look the best. The character and enemy models themselves, although blocky, look great and are well textured.\n\nSound-wise, I'm not sure why this game slipped under the radar for camp voice acting. Some of Natla's lines are on par with the likes of Barry's "Jill sandwich". In all seriousness though, the ambient sound and music (where available; unfortunately the game is stripped of most of Nathan McCree's beautiful compositions from the PlayStation version) coupled with the sharp blasts of gunfire and Lara's various grunts (and hilarious screams) makes this one of the best sounding games I've played.\n\nBut these just supplement the best part of the game; the gameplay and controls themselves. The eloquent and just right mix of platforming, puzzle-solving and exploding-mummy shooting provide constant and consistent variety; you're never bored playing this game. Lara's various techniques are easy to perform thanks to the very tight controls; it's easy to predict where Lara will land, if she will grab onto the right ledge, and if she'll take damage from a fall. In fact, it would be not too hard a task to complete the whole game without dying. The precision of the controls combined with the square tiles mean you can pretty much always calculate a jump, which in turn means that it's absolutely your fault every single time that you plummet to your painful, neck-breaking death.\n\nThe difficulty and length are also just right. The learning curve is magnificent, gradually building up the difficulty and length with each level. It took me 15 hours to pass 15 levels (the 3 extra hours were starting over and over, as I tend to do), which is amazing for an action-adventure game.\n\nThere is only a few nitpicks I have here, and none of these to do with the game itself, but with Steam's pretty lacklustre effort in making it compatible with modern operating systems. This game is a c-word to get working on modern systems. I remember buying the Red Ant retail version of Unfinished Business back in 2000 and crying (I was 4 then) because it wouldn't run properly on Windows 2000. So, needless to say, it's annoying to get working. So while I do give kudos to Steam (or rather GOG and DOSbox as they're the ones who did all the actual work), some very grating issues persist.\n\nFor one, each time a cutscene plays (pre-rendered FMVs) I have to alt-enter, and alt-tab, and watch it windowed, otherwise it won't play. And there's a 50%ish chance that DOSBox will crash each time I alt-tab, so that's kind of irritating. Also, if you close the game other than using the in-game exit button, the gamma of the game will translate to your actual machine. Meaning that if you had just started a level and gamma was higher than say, when the screen was fading out after completing a level, your computer will have an annoyingly bright display until it's restarted. Not sure if this happens to anyone else though, so it's not a major issue. Finally, why weren't the Unfinished Business bonus levels or the music included as well? There's an awesome guide on the game's Steam Community which adds these extras, but it's baffling as to why they aren't included by default.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=118984427\n\nIn the end, the awesome original game is still there, and it does save a lot of infuriating trial-and-error getting it to work on a modern system. I heartily recommend this game to anyone who likes amazing games. I'd wait until the Tomb Raider pack is on sale though, so you can play its many, many sequels as well (including the new, shiny survival game with lots of DLCs!). It often goes on sale for $20ish bucks, which is 10 games in one bundle. A shame it doesn't include Guardian of Light!\n\n4.5/5","March 26, 2014","true","18.2"," 49 of 50 people (98%) found this review helpful","98","49","50","0","0"

Once you do, there's a great adventure waiting for you under the clunky gameplay and the blocky aesthetics. The puzzles are occasionally quite clever, and some of the areas are pretty well designed.\n\nWhat the PC version does better than, say, the PlayStation version, is that you can save anywhere you like. However, this version has no music in it at all. Only ambient background sounds.\n\nIf you like the Tomb Raider series, a nostalgic trip back to the first game might not be such a bad idea. Be sure to get it when it's cheap, though, because I have a hard time recommending it full-price unless you're a die-hard fan.","November 27, 2013","true","17.0"," 53 of 58 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","53","58","0","3"

If you're reading this then you've definitely already heard about the series, so there's not much of a point to recommend. It's a must play category title with great level design and soundtrack. The game takes place in 4 differently themed locations (so it doesn't get boring), each location has at least 3 levels. There's also a free expansion pack called "Unfinished Business" that has 4 extra levels (PC exclusive).\n\nWhile TR is certainly not a realistic game (finding medipacks and ammo in tombs) I couldn't imagine it being different. You have to sacrifice a bit of realism to keep the game fun and entertaining. For the most hard working / curious explorers each level has at least one secret. Depending on the secret you may get ammo, medipacks or even a new weapon (early access in a way).\n\nThe PC version isn't as good as the PlayStation version, considering that the PC version was released for DOS it lacks some features. It runs through DosBox, resolution can be increased but it's not the best experience. Everything is fixable as long as you're using 3rd party software such as Glidos. It enhances the game visually and also restores it's original audio quality. You can play it at pillarboxed 1080p without any problems at all.","September 23, 2014","true","39.1"," 43 of 51 people (84%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","84","43","51","2","0"

Ms Croft, far from the first female video game protagonist but arguably the most influential, runs through a short cave system not dissimilar to that of the opening levels, and gracefully swan dives into a pool from the very top of a waterfall. As Lara, you indiscriminately kill a few wolves, and then you find yourself in this expansive, jungle-like environment. The pitch black darkness above - the result of hardware limitations at the time - was intended to imply an outdoor, night time environment. It doesn’t quite pull it off, and you might feel like you’re still in a cave, miles underground, shrubs and trees inexplicably growing all around you. One thing’s for sure, though - you’re entirely alone.\n\nBut not for long. Two creatures attack, on top of you so quickly you hardly have time to register it. You push on, hoping there’s not more of them - the earlier Tomb Raider games had a genuine fear factor to them, a genuine sense of vulnerability - and just as you’re about to pass under a broken bridge, wondering what might have caused such destruction, the screen starts to shake. The tense musical cue kicks in*, and then it appears. A huge polygon monstrosity roars at you with not-quite CD quality sound, and then it’s up to you - fight or flight.\n\nWhat makes this so notable a moment in the present day is that the Lost Valley was the third level of a fifteen level game. The Tyrannosaurus Rex does not act as a bookend for the game, or even for the level itself. It is not part of some grand set piece, or even an epic boss fight - provided you can avoid the damn thing’s jaws, a gunfight will last about twenty seconds, and yes, you can even beat the level without killing it at all.\n\nWhat we have here is game design from an era where things weren’t focus-tested into banality, when developers implemented outstandingly memorable moments without basing an entire game around it. A T-Rex in Level Three suggests a time when developers could, in short, do close to whatever they wanted. Dinosaurs wandering around Peru? Well, sure, why the hell not? Jurassic Park had come out three years prior, and dinosaurs were the next big thing in entertainment. It didn’t necessarily make a lot of sense for Tomb Raider, from a contextual standpoint or a gameplay standpoint, but somehow, it worked. And Tomb Raider’s full of moments like that - our heroine’s making her way through a mutant-infested Atlantis, complete with fleshy, pulsating walls, and then she enters what appears to be… an underground skateboard park? And sure enough, someone’s riding towards her, skateboard under his feet, twin Uzis in his hands, spitting out a remark that seem to be an almost-quote from Taxi Driver (“You firing at me? You firing at me?!”).\n\nThese days are long gone. If you’re going to put dinosaurs in a game, dinosaurs have to *make* the game. You certainly can’t go putting a T-Rex in the third level. And forget murderous skaters altogether. You’d have half your audience scratching their heads. For better or for worse, consistency and logic are cornerstones of modern gaming - triple A and indie alike, I’d argue - and the times when developers could truly put an idea in their game “just because” are over. For those who can handle the archaic controls and dated visuals**, Tomb Raider remains well worth playing today. More recent Tomb Raider titles provide the same exotic locations and eclectic blend of platforming, exploration and combat as the original, but they often feel like you’re strapped into the seat of a rollercoaster - it's frequently breathtaking, but you're very much on a set path. For that reason, it’s the original 1996 release that has me coming back whenever I want a fix of the exotic, the surreal, and the often downright bizarre.\n\nTomb Raider. Come for the dinosaurs. Stay for the gun-totting skateboarder.\n\n*Strangely, this Steam version of Tomb Raider seems to lack musical cues such as the one signalling the appearance of the Tyrannosaurus Rex. I’m not sure if this is my setup, but other cues, such as Lara’s voiceovers during the tutorial in her mansion home, play fine.\n\n**The Steam version of Tomb Raider provides the smoothest graphical setup I’ve seen for the game, providing texture qualities not far removed from late-generation PS1 games, or even early Dreamcast titles. Unfortunately, it also introduces occasional screen tearing, clipping and pop-up/draw distance issues.","June 22, 2015","true","3.6"," 21 of 22 people (95%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","95","21","22","3","1"

It's what got me to buy a Playstation and enter the world of the action/adventure genre. I loved that the lead character was female. I loved the graphics and the music that sucked you into another world. I loved the satisfaction you felt when you figured out a difficult puzzle or found every single secret on a level. I have played this game a bazillion times and it never gets old. Actually, knowing every little detail of the game from the PS1 version but having to learn how to play it on the keyboard is a fun challenge.\n\nAdditional Note: I've played through about half of TR1 on the PC and I've noticed a lack of the lovely music from the PS1 version. However, you can more clearly hear atmospheric noise such as wind howling, rocks shifting, water trickling through ducts, certain animal noises, etc. I miss the music but I'm enjoying the background noises.\n\nSecond Addition: I'm very proud of myself. It's no easy task to play Tomb Raider using only the keyboard but I was determined. And actually, I got a lot more proficient at using the keyboard to control her than I thought would be the case. I just beat the game with 100% of the secrets under my belt and I had a lot of fun.

I decided to give the experience a try with the original game, and I must say, I am more than satisfied. The complexity of every single level and the abscence of a map drives you to think for yourself, and challenges your sense of direction. Puzzles are neatly put, containing subtle references to mythological elements of the setting. Combats are present only to add to the atmosphere rather than presenting actual action so far, but action element has always been optional in Puzzle Platforms for me. I find the game to be brilliant, well-thought and challenging both for its age, and present.

I don't think I need to sing its praises too much. The Steam port runs on DOSBox, so it comes with a few issues that may bother you, but these are easily fixable and the community is super helpful about it. The lack of music can also be fixed with a mod, and the Gold exclusive levels can also be downloaded free and legally from the official site and made to launch from Steam. Overall, DOSBox can be a blessing in disguise if you're willing to work with it, so don't let it discourage you. Read up on some community guides and ask the forumites for help if necessary.\n\nBeing the first game in a successful series, it shares the same quality as many other great firsts in gaming history, and there's certainly nothing wrong with it, but the sequels did build on it and raise the bar, so anyone who played those first might find the original a bit lacking in some areas. For one thing, TR1 was made to run on the SEGA Saturn, so the performance is a bit slower than TR2-TR5, despite using the same engine, and Lara's ponytail is missing because the Saturn simply couldn't handle it. The weapon selection is also limited, as 3 of the 4 weapons are clearly tiered upgrades over each other, the shotgun being the odd one out with strategic uses. There is also no dynamic lighting, so the game is mostly brightly lit with a few rare dark areas you can't really do anything about. The sound design is also more basic. There aren't specific sounds for Lara's footsteps on each type of texture. If these all sound like nitpicks, it's because they are. Where this game truly shines is in its level design, and the environments that are fun to just explore, even when you're stuck. Tomb Raider the first is a great game, and you should play it... but if you're new to the series, you definitely shouldn't stop after finishing the first one.","December 9, 2013","true","27.4"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

And you know what? I still have fun. And many many great memories come back. And now, I wanna play Anniversary (I have it). You want to know that time I grew up? Play Tomb Raider. You'll understand why Lara Croft became that icon (it's not only the boobs, guys and girls).\n\nAs a girl, having a female main character that is using her brains is very refreshing. Lara Croft has really left her mark on me. Lara Croft is an adventurer/archaeologist, contacted by Jacqueline Natla to retrieve an artifact called the Scion, in Peru. And that's how Lara began her journey through Peru to the lost city of Atlantis.\n\nTomb Raider is a mix of adventure/shooter. Playing in a third person perspective, you control easily Lara, despite some weirds camera movement. You have weapons to defend yoursef against animals like wolves, bats, lions, gorillas.... and the famous T-Rex. In that first game, Lara doesn't really face humans apart for Natla's men (and they're not in majority).\n\nBut generally, you're running, jumping, swimming from a point to another because you have keys to find or levers to use to open doors. And if you're hurt, you can find health kits. As for the weapons, the pistols have infinite ammo.\n\nThe soundtrack is good and the ambient sounds are also a huge factor: you hear it when you're in a cavern.\n\nKeep in mind that Tomb Raider I is the 1996 game. Back then, these graphics were really good. Even if Lara's boobs are not...well, round. But you know when you're in Egypt: between a Sphinx and hieroglyphs and sand...\n\nTrue, Anniversary is taking some liberties and is a remake of Tomb Raider I. True, Anniversary may be better than Tomb Raider I. But while I prefer Anniversary, Tomb Raider I will be forever as one of these games that marked me with Doom II, Colonize, Age of Empires and Half-Life.\n\nI may be not the avid fan of Lara Croft, I grew up too. But she will be forever in my heart. She will be forever that female character that made me finally feel like I was at my place as a girl playing video games.","January 14, 2013","true","17.9"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

It truly is a Tomb Raider game, and the first of its kind. However it can be frustrating, mainly because of how difficult it can be controlling Lara and the camera not lining up.\n\nGraphics/Sound+ Beautiful, nostalgiclooking\n+ Nice audio\n\nI won't go too much into the graphics, seeing as it is an older game and obviously could not live up to today's games standards. It still makes you feel like you're on an adventure, and tombs still look daunting. It is an old game, so don't expect to be blown away by the audio or visual aspects of the game, however they are still pleasing.\n\nControls+ Controls can be remapped\n- Difficult, and frustrating\n- Terrible camera\n\nThe problem with Tomb Raider I is the controls. They are very confusing, and I suggest you remap them to the WASD, space bar, E controls that are common today. Traversal can be irritating, and the camera often isn't facing the right way, making some jumps unnecessarily hard.\nDespite this, it can still be fun to play. Yes some of the jumps are difficult and can take you multiple tries to simply get up a ledge, but despite this, it is still an enjoyable game.\n\nOverall/Quick Review\nTomb Raider I is a fun, nostalgic leap into the past where you can experience the game that started one of the best series in gaming history. Fun gameplay and interesting story, but sometimes the controls and camera can make the game more frustrating and irritating than fun and enjoyable.\n\nIf you want to play this game, but worry about the controls and camera issues, being how it is older, pick up Tomb Raider Anniversary. It is an almost exact remake of this game, with better gameplay, easier controls, and roughly the same level design.\n\nRecommended for any Tomb Raider fans, old or new.\nFun game that takes you back to your childhood.\nBuy it.\n\nMANDATORYSUGGESTIONS BEFORE YOU PLAY\nI highly recommend you follow this link, and do as it says. It makes the game less buggy, crash less, look better, and simply just improve the game overall.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=127637434\n\nRemap the controls to the usual WASD to move, E to interact, space to jump, and so on before you play, as the default controls will feel clunky and difficult.\n\nDon't jump and then hit E (interact) to climb up! Simply hold E and W, and Lara will jump up and grab, and climb up by herself. It makes the game much less frustrating and easier to control. It took me a long time to learn this.\n\nSAVE AS OFTEN AS POSSIBLERight before a hard jump, save. After you make that jump, SAVE If you fall you can simply reload and try again without having to start back from the very beginning. It makes the game far less infuriating and much more enjoyable.\n\nNote: If you do not save before you die in the beginning of the game, you will be sent back to the main menu and have to restart all over, including remapping the controls. Save as soon as possible.","March 20, 2015","true","20.4"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","0"

My only memories of playing the game when I was younger are ones of frustration at the controls and an infantile infatuation with Lara Croft which probably kept me playing a lot longer than I should have.\n\nWhat I found however, was a pretty solid, 3D action-adventure game that holds up way better than I thought it would. The controls can feel counter-intuitive at first but once you get a basic understanding of how it all works, It starts to work pretty well, at least for a game that was designed before the advent of dual analogue sticks.\n\nThe game has you exploring various environments, encountering traps, enemies and platforming puzzles along the way. It's pretty simple. Levels will often show you a door requiring multiple keys and leave you to explore the surrounding area in search of them. The game doesn't offer much guidance for locating these keys and that's what really drew me in. Being left alone to explore an area with just a compass (which I'm pretty sure has no in game use) and two guns with no immediate direction provided a very liberating sense of exploration that I haven't felt in a video game for years.\n\nIt'll require a little patience and maybe looking at a walkthrough a handful of times but there is absolutley a good time to be had with Tomb Raider 1 in 2016.","February 29","true","21.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","1"

It literally forces you to use one hand to play the entire game, but on the bright side, you can use your free hand to multitask while you struggle to remember archaic controls on the number pad that some keyboards don't even have anymore. Someone needs to make some sort of update for this to make the pc controls better or provide some sort of controller support for this game to actually be playable. I've seen the forums and have attempted to follow their instructions on how to be able to map the controls to an xbox controller, but I've had literally no luck when following their instructions.","November 17, 2015","true","0.6"," 10 of 16 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","10","16","0","4"

The game set the foundation of the action adventure genre and many games took advantage of the unique concepts of the game after that. In that time the game was unique and one of its kind which sold over 8 million copies worldwide during the first few months of release for Sony PlayStation and PC.\n\nThe game introduced revolutionary 3D worlds that the player could examine and impressive and exciting combat mechanics and gameplay as well as some of the best graphics during that time. The cut scenes were from very high level of detail and the character animations of the characters were some of the best ever made back then.  The player could also save the game progress whenever needed which made the experience more enjoyable.\n\nThe level designs of the game were smart, cunning and full of potential. The originality and creativity that was putted in the game made it a classic. The memorable boss fights and the smart ways of progression through the levels really left a landmark in the video game industry. Now Lara Croft Is one of the most recognizable action heroines in the video game history. I will give Tomb Raider an 8/10.","January 1, 2015","true","11.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It was quite an ordeal to get this dinosaur working on Windows 10, but I did it, and was pleasantly surprised with what I found. Tomb Raider is a fun, complex, old-school platformer with a side helping of shooting lions and gorillas in the face. Despite the extremely dated graphics and lack of music (this being the DOS version) it has a great, spooky atmosphere and a surprisingly large variety despite the whole game taking place in dusty tombs. The controls are kind of wonkey, but once you get used to them you'll find a difficult, yet rewarding experience that will curb anyones hunger for some good-ole jump timing.","October 20, 2015","true","16.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","3","3","2","1"

Some levels were so big that I got lost a few times, made worse by the fact that there is no in-game map! Many secret areas are available as well.\n\nThe weapon arsenal isn't really that huge (pistols with unlimited ammo, shotgun, magnums and Uzis), but it's fine for this type of game, which focuses on exploration more than shooting. Not having a weapon reload function also helps concentrate more on that.\n\nThere are many enemies as well, from wolves and evil henchmen to raptors (and a lone T-Rex! Felt really good fighting it!) and supernatural monsters.\n\nAs for the graphics, which also brings me to recommending or not this game, I have to say that they are good enough for a 1996 game, but, having said that, modern gamers accustomed to today's graphics will probably not like this (the gameplay also feels obsolete for today's standards).\n\nAn expansion pack was also made available for PC (called Unfinished Business, which features 4 additional levels), but is not present in the Steam version, as well as the original Playstation game's music (which is a letdown, since the Steam version's in-game music is almost non-existent, while the Playstation one added a lot to the atmosphere), but thankfully I found this guide which fixes both those issues. I advise new players to read it before starting the game.\n\nHaving said all that, I fully recommend this game for fans of exploration, adventure and a bit of shooting, taken with a grain of retro salt!\n\n","February 15, 2015","true","27.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

It could have something to do with the fact it was the first game i bought for the Playstation though.\n\nGraphics Well let's get this out of the way then; The graphics were amazing at that time when it launched on the Playstation, let alone the PC version. But most games that came out in the Playstation era did not age well, this is no exception. The graphics look blocky, just like most Playstation games.\n\nGameplay Tomb Raider's gameplay didn't change much over the years so there's nothing special on that front. Lara shoots & jumps and that's about it. She's not able to crouch in this game yet, but she can switch levers!\n\nCharacters The protagonist of Tomb Raider is ofcourse Lara Croft, I don't think there's anyone that doesn't know who that is. The other characters in the game are quite interesting too. The voice acting wasn't great but it didn't bother me much.\n\nStory I won't say the game's story will blow your mind but it's pretty decent and makes you want to play on.\n\nAtmosphere Most of the game takes place in Ancient buildings, Ruins, Tombs and Caves with lots of references to mythical gods. Obviously one of the things that made this game so great.\n\nMusic/Sound One of the reasons why Tomb Raider is such a memorable game. I know Music or sounds doesn't make a game but it sure can make it stand out from the rest. The sounds themselves are nothing special but the music is something special. Beautiful Ambient tracks and Orchestrial tracks will be played whenever you enter a new location and it instantly sets the mood.\n\nWeapons There are only a few weapons in the game but I don't think this game needs a lot of weapons.\n\nEnemies Tomb Raider has a big variety of enemies. Most of the time you will be shooting animals, some of them are endangered species or even extinct. Aside from animals you will be battling monsters and a few humans.\n\nConclusion As I already said before; Tomb Raider will always be one my favourite games and I would recommend anyone, who isn't afraid of outdated graphics, to try this game.\n","October 27, 2014","true","0.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I guess we'll never know now will we? The secret is locked in this ancient crypt of a game.","March 18, 2015","true","0.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","1"

Most of which have been burried underground (actually due to technical limitations) For me this simply adds to the epicness factor, as you explore a huge city or colosseum hidden underground.\n\nThere is so much that can be said about this game, I have never personally completed it on Playstation 1, but having it on Steam now i hope to do so.\nSome people do say the controlls are hard to use, i do agree, to a very limited extend. I believe it's simply down to learning them, and accepting them. The controlls are abit stiff, but overall when you get used to them, they are great.\n\nPutting down the game because of the controlls not being 'easy' and abit stiff, would be a big shame, as this is a game that must be experience by anyone who loves adventure and exploration games.\n\nAnd now for the question everyone asks; Does the Steam version run on modern systems at all? To which i can happy reply; Yes.\nThe Steam version of this game is FANTASTIC, it runs very well, has working Steam GUI. And if you want to upgrade the visual quality, that can also be done with one or two quick modifications.","February 10, 2015","true","16.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I do this every few years with various things I liked as a tween, Linkin Park, being another prime example, before remembering that my 12 year old self wasn't actually that bright.\n\nThat's not to say Tomb Raider is bad. It's just aged pretty badly, early 90's 3D makes Lara look like she's been carved out of wood and she always tends to be trying to merge with the scenery. Environments aren't much better, in the back of your head, you're always vaguely aware that the whole game seems to be built on a grid, (every block the same size, etc). So aesthetically it's crap, but how does it play?\n\nModerately badly now you mention it. To be fair Lara does control extremely well for running around, making huge leaps, somersaulting and shooting. It's when the game gets into the second act and the fiddly jumps come in that the controls become a problem. If you, like me, played Tomb Raider back before the iPod was invented then you probably remember with fondness the screaming masogynistic curses you would yell at Lara as she dived into a spike pit instead of the desired ledge. It is not actually that fun reliving said experience.\n\nMy final gripe is actually hard to describe. (some background) I got all the old Tomb Raiders in a steam sale and binged on them over a weekend off, (this is the best of the lot) and I started to get this nagging feeling. The same feeling I got while playing too much Diablo 2: 'it's all the same.' you are doing the same thing over and over. Theres not much game here really, just a series of levers you have to pull in the correct order. That combined with the ugliness and the frustration drove the final nail into the nostalgia coffin.\n\nHaving said all that, it's still a great game and definately worth £4.99. The reason for this is similar to the reason I like similarly hideous game 'Deus Ex'. Because it's ugly as sh*t the designers could make pretty much whatever they wanted. The game is loooooooong, the variety is fantastic and the different locales are great. the game is packed with highlight set pieces, like the T-rex attack, the colosseum fight, the Sphinx, a statue turning Lara into gold, Atlantis city and a certain (very vertical) level in which you must pass the challenges of the gods. That's the reason I kept coming back to the shoddier sequels. For that sense of adventure I shared with a woman with an extremely impractical set of mammary glands.","November 25, 2013","true","17.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This is just plain wrong. The controls for this game are tricky initially but after mere minutes of playing, you will have mastered them and will be a fair way through the caves as well. Mind you, you need a full QWERTY keyboard to play this properly, playing this on my Laptop is painful without rebinding the keys.\n\nI was raised with this being played on the PSX and thought I knew exactly what I was in for, I was wrong. the PC version of this game, with the GLIDE renderer, is brilliant and still holds up fairly well. There are a few things you may have to do before playing this to fully appreciate the game. First off, download nGlide (It's a Google search away, look for the Zeus Software link). Then, download the latest version of Taewoong's DosBox build (another Google search away), it's by far the best version of DosBox you can grab. Once you've done this and configured nGlide to however suits you you're jet set to sink hours into this game.\n\nThe levels, set in Peru, Greece, Egypt and Atlantis, are designed perfectly to accommodate a fine mix of action and puzzles, a mix that the sequels have somewhat slanted in favour of action. Not only that, but they are designed with great care and attention to detail. The textures are a bit skewed at times, but really this only adds to the charm that is the engine it was built upon and you'll see other imperfections, but if you want to let that bother you, you need to step back for a sec and see the game as a whole.","June 22, 2014","true","0.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I mean, it's fu**ing olde. So olde it doesn't even have mouse support. So olde you can use it in yo momma jokes dealing with age. I was ready to sh*t all over it. I had this steaming fudge soup tearing a hole in my assh*le and I was ready to give it a Cleveland Steamer. Don't bother googling that: it's when you s*it on someone's chest.\n\nBut I gave it a shot anyway, cause I live life on the edge; also it came with the reboot. I looked up some other reviews and it was typical ''oh man this is the best in the series'' and ''CLASSIC''. Bull. It's always the same ''best game evar'' crap.\n\nBut it's actually not....a bad...game? Don't get me wrong, it's still olde, but so far I've played through the first level (four in total) and am actually impressed. The shooting is terrible and you can't aim, but if you can excuse the bad aspects you still have a pretty competent title. There are secrets hidden throughout the levels, and the levels are actually pretty big for their time. There's a fair amount of exploration and if you can put aside the sometimes crappy camera, you get a pretty good 3D platformer. The base level design is pretty good, and if it weren't for the outdated mechanics and Laura handling like an RE character (pre 4), this would still be a great title capable of still holding its own.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm not strongly recommending this. Or even casually telling you to get it. The boss battles have the ''Mirrors Edge'' syndrome; completely unecessasry and the game lacks the mechanics to actually make them worthwhile. It would benefit from taking all combat away. But the game, if you can overlook outdated...everything, still has a worthwhile ''base'' composed of platforming, exploration, and level design that is still impressively pertinent. It's no Mario 64 (that game, graphics aside, is not outdated at all), and I'm not really enthusiastic about recommending it. But the bottom line is this: I don't hate the damn thing so I'm gonna give it a thumbs up if only because I'm pretty impressed at how I'm actually not disliking it so far. In fact, it's...kinda entertaining, so far.","April 21, 2014","true","35.8"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","4","7","0","2"

В своих первых экспедициях, по её воспоминаниям, всё было очень непросто. Она могла десятки раз пытаться запрыгнуть на далекостояшую платформу, когда же прыжок бьл неимоверно опасен, она мысленно совершала его иногда сотни раз, пока не появлялась уверенность в том, что всё получится.

Оно казалось ужасно тяжёлым и неуклюжим, но постепенно она как будто к этому привыкла. Её перестала раздражать собственная неповоротливость, она даже научилась её использовать. Было чертовски сложно, чертовски. Но это ни с чем не сравнить. Она чувствовала себя взрослой. Никто не говорил ей, что делать, куда идти, никто не подсказывал решение головоломки.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Will1996/recommended/224960/","Will1996","Zer0","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Will1996/","219 products in account","Tomb Raider is an action platformer made and released by Core Design in the year 1996. This game was originally released for the Playstation 1, and Sega Saturn. It was also released for PC through the usage of DOSBox. For those who are wanting to get into the Lara Croft : Tomb Raider series, this game is somewhat hard to recommend, despite being the first of the franchise.\n\nPlease not that I have played and beaten both, the PS1 and PC edition. This review, however, is based upon my experience with the Steam version of Lara Croft : Tomb Raider 1\n\n\nStory\nThe story is decent. The cutscenes just tell you enough to get you started, then leaves the rest to your imagination. It reveals itself the further  it goes in, followed by a lame plot twist at the end which left me dumb founded. Overall, its not bad.\n7.5\n\n\nGraphics\nFor an old school game, it looks alright. The game was made back when polygonal 3D graphics started going big, so there was much work to be done before they could perfect making any round objects. Back in it's time, it was no doubt some of the top of the line graphics. Compared to today's technology in graphical development, it's hard to get into this type of game unless you're a fan of the classics. If you are are into the "shiny" and new games, then look away, this game is not for you.\n7.0\n\n\nSound\nI'm usually very picky when it comes to in- game music, sound effects, etc... but TR had nothing I could really complain about. The music and effects seemed pretty immersive, which left little to be desired in this specific type of game. The battle music is intense and frightening, giving the game more of the survival feel in intense situations. Also, the music for the theme, finding secrets, and walking into a mysterious place has always suited the moment well. As for the effects, they are alright for an old school DOS game. Every creature, environment, and protagonist has the appropriate sounds for the given situations, which yet again increases immersion. The only aspect I disliked was that of the main protagonist, Lara. Every time she climbs a ledge, runs into a wall, jumps... it sounds far  too artificial... like she's having an... errr.... nevermind. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)\n7.5\n\n\nGameplay\nThe gameplay is my favorite part about this game. The puzzles are somewhat challenging, and the parkour is fun and feels dangerous. The gun fights feel stiff due to the controls, but is still enjoyable. And the thing that makes this so great is the dangerous traps that lurk in each tomb. Avoiding and trying to expect what trap is next is what TR is all about. Feeling that you know something is wrong down the hallway, there probably is. There could be a boulder coming from both directions, or some poison darts coming from the walls, or maybe even a dinosaur will break through the ceiling? That's what makes these kind of games so fun. You don't really know what to expect (At least on your first playthrough). Most of the traps are somewhat unpredictable, so this definitely deserves some big pointers.\n8.5\n\n\nControls\nThe controls are a tad bit funky. Why? Because I said so (Kidding).\n\nFor reals, the controls aren't as bad as what people think. The controls are very stiff, so manueverability is somewhat an issue.  I personally used my number pad to link my actions to, then used my wasd as movement. It too some getting used to, but in the end you'll manage.\n\nHowever....\n\nIf you are more of a console enthusiast, or just cant stand using the keyboard for this game... then check out this controller support guide by Darth Sidious ~\nhttp://store.steampowered.com\n\nSince this is an old school game I'll give it some slack on the controls.\n7.0\n\n\nCinematics\nThe cimematics for Tomb Raider were great in terms of quality. That is, I wish I could say that for the PC version. Compared to the Playstation version, the cutscenes are astrocious. Even with all the DosBox tweaking guides I dug up, nothing would seem to fix it. However, this game is not plagued with too many cinematics, so this can be forgiven easily.\n4.5\n\n\nReplayability\nThis game has very little replayability to it. After my first playthrough, I never really felt the need to collect all the secrets collectibles since they never did anything special. For those of you who played it before purchasing the game on steam would most likely replay it due to nostalgic reasons. But besides that, I wouldn't really see much of a point.\n4.5\n\n\n==============================================================================\nOverall Score\n7.0\nA good game for you classic gamers who enjoy platformers and puzzles. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)\n==============================================================================","March 4","true","13.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Apparently since this is an older game it uses something called DOSBox and if you want to configure a controller you will be fighting a losing battle. If you are okay with playing with the keyboard then  this game is for you. With controllers you may get about half of it configured and then it won't save your configuration. There might be a way to fix it but I haven't really found anything except that others are experiencing the same problem. The game will randomly freeze sometimes and will freeze if you try mapping the controller by hitting F1. The game is a great game and I am disappointed that I can't enjoy it. I mean I didn't expect a game that I paid for to be freezing up especially with settings being normal and full internet connection. It would be really nice for an update by either Dosbox or Steam to fix the problem.  So I'm really nuetral about the game, because if you don't mess with the controller and work off the keyboard then it tends to run okay, but if you try to configure the controller then its downhill from there.","December 22, 2014","false","3.6"," 18 of 39 people (46%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","46","18","39","0","1"

But if you only care about modern games [nothing to be ashamed of], you likely won't enjoy this game. I will do my best to review this game from the former point of view.\n\nPutting aside the ridiculously "top-heavy" player model for Lara Croft, the game's graphics are okay. A bit polygonal, but not bad overall. I had some issues with DOSbox misplacing renders of non-world objects [e.g. health packs being visible behind walls], but nothing to make it unplayable.\n\nThe design of the levels is ok as well, but many of the jumping puzzles can end up being rather frustrating. This is because often the required key sequence will not always do what you intended [Trying to run and jump might cause a leap from a standing start, and vice versa]. However, the levels as a whole are generally rather extensive for the era, and there is usually a lot to explore.\n\nThe game controls primarily with keyboard only, but it can be configured to use a gamepad. I would very seriously recommend not using a gamepad, as it felt very sluggish and unresponsive.\n\nThe gameplay surrounding gunfights can be ridiculous at times, with both enemies and yourself soaking up bullets like sponges concrete. The game does auto-aim, and doesn't require reloading, so you can run around the map shooting everything with no difficulty whatsoever. Beware bats though, if one gets on top of you and you get stuck in a corner, you're done for.\n\nTo summarize, this game has flaws. It isn't completely terrible, so if you want to play this game for nostalgic purposes then go ahead, but otherwise don't bother.","April 28, 2015","false","5.6"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","20","1","5","0","3"

The controls feel more like something out of an old arcade machine, and not the good ones. I mean one of those untouched, unheard of fighting games with about ten buttons for punching and kicking each, and some of the worst receptivity you'll ever play with. I was literally saving every platform I jump I made, and that is preettty bad when most of this game's puzzles involve platforming. You have to hit and hold three buttons at a time to jump and latch onto a platform, and if you do not hit those buttons at exactly the same time, then you either jump incorrectly or don't latch on, and this... oh this is bad. This should be fixed, she should automatically latch on when you jump, or atleast jump in the direction you move. Surely they had the technology to do this at that point in time, right?  Then even worse is her BASIC movement. Yes, Lara's basic steps and turns are so bad it makes some of the game almost unplayable. When she steps forward she moves about 3-5 feet, and when she moves back she does this annoying hop that goes about 5 feet back. This becomes even more nerve-racking when you take into consideration that ANY type of movement left or righ can result in a rol, cartwheel, or side-jump that messes you up 80 percent of the time. This breaks most of the game (at least for me), and makes it darn near almost unplayable.\n\nThen there is the fighting/shooting and obtaining/activating items. This is not as bad as platforming, but pretty close in it's own rite. To pick up on item, you have to face it, stand directly in front of it and press "use". This sounds easy, until you take into mind she moves about 5 feet every step she makes, making this beyond tedious. Then when you must activate an item such as a lever, they want it to be almost exactly on point, and this is more of a pain because most items you must activate are small and hard to get Lara to stand in front of, which makes overall interaction with your enviornment annoying and a pain. The when you shoot, there is a horrid auto-aim mechanic that just makes her swing in circles over and over when enemies move, and she generally stays locked on, so when that enemy is dead, you can bet she'll stil lbe standing there shooting it's dead body. This is somewhat humorous... but a pain in the butt. Generally you are being attacked by 2 or more enemies, so shooting the dead body just ends up getting you killed, and her reflexes are horrible, so turning usually results in more attacks from your enemies, and a dead Lara. This is very tedious, and I do not know how the developers left it like this, and just makes me think  even more that this game is cheap and half-way done.\n\nTo end, the game has no soundtrack. Yep, none. The only thing you hear is a looped boom and crumble-like sound that just makes the pretty repetitous and bland enviornments even more so. This not only adds to the overall boredome this game provides, but makes it very annoying to play, and I am thankful the developers at least added the option to turn it off.\n\nOverall, this could have been AMAZING... but because of bad aging and horrible PC controls, it is a horrid train-wreck of an excuse for a "game". The only really good factor is it's saving mechanism, considering it actually functions quite well and is quite fast. Overall i'd give this a 3/10, considering the amount of happiness you fel when you actually get the games mechanics down to a point. For anyone other than die-hard TOMB RAIDERS, i'd say stay away from this game at all costs.","June 19, 2014","false","1.7"," 1 of 14 people (7%) found this review helpful","7","1","14","0","2"

I have never played Tom Raider until today. It is considered a classic in the adventure genre and I can somewhat agree. But there is a huge problem. The game hasn't aged well. Lets talk about the most important aspect of a game. Controls. You seem to move in a tight grid for some reason and I don't know why. If you take a great game like Doom at the time, the controls were amazing. It made you feel free to move. But here, the control is the most difficult part of the game.\n\nIf you are playing on windows 8 which I am, do not press the windows button. If you do, the game will crash for no reason. It is the stupidest thing ever. Anyways you have to press alt and control to jump and to climb up ledges and space to get your guns out. But sometimes, its confusing because I think I am pressing alt when I'm pressing Space!\n\nWho thought it would be a good idea to make space not the button for jumping?! ALL GAMES HAVE THAT! Also, it crashes randomly for no reason. But as long as you get used to them, you will be fine. I just hope Anniversary's controls are better than this. But anyways, its fun and you want to keep playing to see what you will find. Its nice.\n\nI have only played at least 1-1/4 of a hour of it so I might post a bigger review of it soon.\n\n*UPDATE* The game has a glitch I found that is beyond repair. When you get to the Lost Valley, you will find a dinosaur and when it attacks you, you're computer monitor will go upside down. Thanks. Now I can't play it. Unfotunately, I will have to play Anniversary in order to play the games in order now. Which sucks.

Saying that it isn't intuitive is an understatement. After frustration of trying to figure out simple maneuvers, I found the menu that shows controls, only to have camera angle (defined in game as "look") just say PADO. It has to run through emulation software called dos box which may or may not crash on you occasionally. It's hard to believe Soul Reaver and Mario 64 came out around the same time as this.\n\nWhat I did happen to think was pretty neat was that in the Steam menu you can access the original manual, which starts with an introduction to Laura's beginnings.

That wouldn't be fair. No, this game is bad even for the time it came out.\n\nThe biggest problem for me are the controls. First, as far as I can tell, there is no native support for gamepads or even the mouse. The former is somewhat understandable (even relatively recent games often lack this, even when they're console ports), but the latter is totally inexcusable for a game made in 1996. There are ways to map the keys to a modern controller, but that's of limited use because the controls are AWFUL.\n\nBasic movement is okay; the game uses tank controls, which work okay... unless you have to move quickly, in which case you're pretty screwed. Jumping is finicky, and the positions you have to be in for certain jumps (or to pick up items or flip switches) are super precise. Lara runs by default, and you'll almost always have to stop, turn in place, and walk slowly to get to the exact spatial point the game wants you to be in to pick something up or flip a switch.\n\nThere is also NO camera control. Oh, you can look around while you're standing still; but you can't move the camera while Lara is in motion, and it springs right back to the default fixed camera angle as soon as you let go on the look button. This often means making jumps onto ledges or whatnot that you can't actually see.\n\nA game with controls like this should also not have an emphasis on combat, or if it does the enemies should be slow. Instead, there's tons of combat and EVERY SINGLE ENEMY IN THE GAME is faster than you, and will often stun-lock you to death. Thankfully, you don't really have to aim - Lara will do that herself - but sometimes the autoaim just plain doesn't work, or it won't point at the enemy you want.\n\nThere are also a number of timed precision platforming puzzles in the game that are nearly impossible with the game's terrible control scheme. In fact, one of them in one of the last levels I literally couldn't get through except by glitching the game physics out and forcing Lara through a hole she wasn't supposed to be able to get through.\n\nThere are also a few bugs I encountered, though I'm not sure if these are the game's fault or DOSBox's. Certain areas will be dark the first time you come through, but then if you reload the save it will be well-lit (or vice versa). There's also several points in the second to last level where Lara will sometimes just burst into flame for no reason (apparently a problem with the hitbox detection on the lava). Unfortunately, Core Design's been dead for seven years, so I don't know who to send a bug report to.\n\nI honestly don't know how anybody beat this game on a console or in the original PC version, which only had save points. The only way I was able to complete it with my sanity intact was to save every couple minutes - more or less every time I completed a difficult jump or killed a few enemies. Even so, the game is infuriating. It took me 21 hours to complete; without the ability to save anywhere, it probably would have been double or triple that. (Or more likely, I just would've given up.)","January 17, 2014","false","21.6"," 6 of 26 people (23%) found this review helpful","23","6","26","0","1"

It's all about the tombs! Unlike the sequels, the original is pretty basic. No outfit changes or extenstive weapon arsenals. Instead, Lara sticks with only four weapons, each sort of acting like an upgrade from the other. Tomb Raider I puts little emphasis on action and focuses more on atmosphere. The effect pays off well allowing the player to experience plently of memorable moments right down to a T-REX in a lost valley all the way to an alien ooze fest in Atlantis. Cool!\n\nThe improvements in TR2-5 are mostly cosmetic and never did they drastically stray away from the formula TRI established. And why should they have?

The classics have been long forgotten and people of the newer generation (like me) generaly don't know about Tomb Raider. Thanks to Steam, we can re-capture those feelings of loneliness and isolation with just the click of a 'play' button.\n\nTomb Raider (I) has no files missing and no major bugs (many minor ones as the game is quite old). The game is intirely play-able but the absense of game-pad support really takes away some of the experience, especially for former PS players, I would recomend Joy-to-Key or X-padder for game-pad support.\n\nThe game itself is really great, if you have never played/heard of TR, you should buy it immediately and play through the intire game from start to finish, don't play any games between or you will most likely take away most of the atmosphere. The DOSBOX (emulator) software doesn't work very well so I would reccomend buying GLIDOS or dgVoodoo to play.\n\nPlease buy TR1 as it was the ground-work for a brilliant franchise and playing the first adventure will always prepare you for the next.","August 2, 2014","true","22.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game is presented in third person perspective. Lara is always visible and the camera follows the action from behind or over her shoulder. The world she inhabits is fully drawn in three dimensions and characterised by its cubic nature. Ledges, walls and ceilings mostly sit at 90 degrees to each other, but sometimes feature sloping planes.\nThe object of Tomb Raider is to guide Lara through a series of tombs and other locations in search of treasures and artefacts. On the way, she must kill dangerous animals and other creatures, while collecting objects and solving puzzles to gain access to an ultimate prize, usually a powerful artefact. Gunplay is restricted to the killing of various animals that appear throughout each stage, although occasionally Lara may be faced with a human opponent. Instead the emphasis lies on solving puzzles and performing trick jumps to complete each level. As such, Tomb Raider in essence harkens back to the classical form of platform style gameplay.","August 12, 2013","true","21.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It has aged rather well but is clearly from the time period, and it sits strongly embedded in those roots from the level design right down to the controls. Lara herself controls like a tank. A very agile tank but still a tank. She moves slow, turns on a dime (if that dime was abnormally obese and the size of a small car) and her jumps respond about as quickly as a sloth. The controls and response times do take some getting used to because of this but once you get them the platforming becomes incredibly easier. This is good considering the gameplay itself is about 70-80 percent platforming with the remaining percent being loading from deaths and shooting it out with enemies. Although the platforming is very well done (once you get the controls down) the same can't exactly be said about the gunplay. It may not be the main focus, that belongs to the tomb raiding, it is certainly a big part and definitely the weakest area of the game. All fights boil down to "hold fire and jump while moving to the side or back." Now this shouldn't normally be a problem but due to the way the jump works (there is a delay by roughly half a second to a second from when you press it so the game knows how you want to jump i.e. forward, backward, standing, or sideways) it makes many fights frustrating when you accidentally jump straight up instead of to the side or back or vice-versa when you are close to ledges and jump off. That still also gets much easier as the game goes on and you get a better grasp on the controls and when you do the already mundane fights become chores to do as all that's left is to jump and hold fire until the enemy is dead. Aside from that I will say this game impressed me greatly with the variety of animations and the art direction though the locales were definitely generic Seriously!? 2 Areas?! You get a tomb in a mountain and 2 tombs in the same desert?!\nCAUTION SPOILER:\nHell the third tomb was a boat ride away from the second in atlantis in a pyramid in a mine on an island in a lake in the desert??\n/SPOILER\nEven though there are few larger locales many levels do have smaller areas with each feeling diverse and unique. The level design is lacking in some places though and you may have to consult a guide as  there are times the levels don't lead you anywhere at all and where you have to go isn't obvious. Also the game breaks its own rules from time to time. Overall a very enjoyable game.

First of all, this game is old. Yes it is. But to be honest, even today people play games with graphics like Minecraft. So I don't think there should be a problem with the Graphics of this particular game. However, if there is a problem for someone, he can grab the anniversary Edition and enjoy the same game with pimped graphics.\nEven though the Graphics are old, they still inherit a great beauty. The Temples and Tombs look really pretty and make it fun to explore the different levels. Especially the last couple of levels look amazing.\nThe story is good but short and not too deep. I liked it a lot though and wish that I get to know more about this story in the next Tomb Raider Games I will play.\nThe Level design is BRILLIANT. It's everything but linear and makes the game really hard to beat. I spent hours in the different levels trying to make out what I have to do to progress. This game for a change really made me think, which I greatly enjoyed.\nThe only thing that made me sad is the fighting mechanics. Due to the fact that this game is very old, the mechanics are too easy for an experienced gamer. You will easily figure out repetitive movements for the different enemies that will make every fight a piece of cake. However, considering the age of this game one can't really blame the developers for that.\n\nAll things considered I personally love this game and will replay it through the anniversary edition for sure. I can recommend this game to everyone who likes exploration, puzzles and adventures. It is a beautiful game worth the time you put into it.\n\n- Pudels","March 23, 2014","true","19.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Essentially the same great game if you previously played the PS version.  There are a few small cons with the PC Steam version, but they are nothing too big.\n\nCons:\n*Missing background music.  The original sounds are there such as gunfire, enemies, ambient, but it is missing the short musical background scores that would usually play during certain moments that would signal danger or caution that would keep you alert and ready for battle.  While nothing to fuss over, it is a bummer.\n\n*Resolution.  This one is hardly anything to get upset over since this game was never meant to be played in HD or widescreen resolution, so it does take a bit of messing around with the game settings to find the perfect resolution and to make the game fit onto the screen. (Even after setting it to my native 1080p resolution, the right side of my monitor would be black).  So you have to find what eventually will work for you.\n\nDespite this, the PROS are that this is a fantastic game (which for its time) has great level design, challenging puzzles, good story, a power-hungry antagonist, and will keep you immersed till the end.  Also, I'd say the PC version is much easier since you can save whenever you like vs the PS version where you needed to find save crystals.\n\nIf you are a Tomb Raider fan, you will definitely love the original if for some reason you have never played it, but played any other installment of the series.","April 1, 2015","true","19.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you ever wonder where the Uncharted games got their inspiration from, this was the game to open the doors to many other third person shooter and adventure genre games.

In the original release of Tomb Raider on the Playstation, many objects had a bright, shiny effect to them and the colors were very intense. In the transition through the years from Playstation to PC to PSN and then to Steam, somehow much of that richness of color and shine has been lost. Still, Steam has rendered a tremendous service to Tomb Raider fans by making the game playable on modern PCs via their platform. True, there is the PSN version, but it really looks terrible on high definition tvs. If Steam really wants to make my day, they will also release the original Tomb Raider's gold levels for their platform. I haven't played those gold levels in many, many years because the original game will not run on modern pcs and PSN has never offered them for download. You hear that, Steam?

After playing the newest edition of Tomb Raider i decided to go back, and as an adult- I've fallen in love with the parts my younger self could not. I love the audio, I love the levels, I love the puzzles, I love the visuals but most of all I love the adventure.\n\nMe and my brother both purchased the game and played it side by side- and we figured out all the puzzles together. There's this one puzzle that literally doesn't give you any clues except a name. It took me and my brother 3 hours to figure this one puzzle out- it wasn't until I remembered a song with the particular myth they were speaking of that we solved it.\n\nVisually- yea the graphics are clunky and dated- but as well as adding charmful nostaglia- I felt that the game overall was much much better than the newer edition! I loved that I didn't get much help- I loved the fact that I had to ration my supplies and I felt that everytime I found a new gun or solved a puzzle or found a secret- I was a Tomb Raider!\n\nThe audio- isn't the best and while some of the voice actors are okay, some are obviously just the best they could get at the time. The music for what little there is- is nice- but most of the time your left with only the sound of your footsteps or what's around- which REALLY works as you have to use your ears to know what's coming or what lies beyond the path.\n\nIf you really wanna sink your teeth into an adventure that has your thinking and on your feet- then your looking at the right game. Visually it's not the best and yea it can be glitchy- but it's a classic and still really holds up!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","June 27, 2014","true","21.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Once a cutting edge invitation to a brand new era of 3D video games, today it offers a trip back in time to the rather primitive beginnings of modern gaming. But that sure doesn't make it any less fascinating.\n\nThe controls, of course, stand out right away for their inaccessibility compared to modern standards. The famous "tank" movement scheme, though, is easier to acclimate to than you might expect. Thanks to the game being in full 3D with a proper behind-the-back camera, you'll be moving forward most of the time anyway, using left and right to subtly "steer" Lara as you go. It isn't perfect (and in combat situations much less so), but it's never the mess that similar controls can create in 2D environments, like in the early Resident Evils.\n\nMore surprising is how finicky the jumping mechanics are. When standing still, the jump button must be pushed just before the direction to jump in, while running jumps over gaps have a specific logic to their timing that makes Lara jump automatically the moment she reaches a platform's edge. Points like these mean it's important to get acquainted with the game's eccentricities before you begin, but doing so is quick and easy thanks to a concise and effective tutorial that's selectable at any time from the main menu.\n\nSo once you've done that, and gotten into the mindset of a late '90s gamer, what lies before you? Why, one of the major milestones of video game history, of course. Considered in context, it's easy to see why Tomb Raider was such a big deal for its time. Releasing in the same six-month window as the original Quake and Super Mario 64, it gave its players an early taste of the sort of freedom of exploration that we take for granted today. And explore you will, as you make your way from room to room, throwing switches, finding keys, and stumbling across cleverly hidden item pickups, with little to guide you but your own skills of observation. At its core, this is a puzzle game about navigating 3D spaces, figuring out where you need to go next, and how to get there. These design principles are some that still form the basics of many modern games, so its only natural that they remain entertaining all these years later.\n\nThere's no denying that Tomb Raider is showing its age, and from start to finish you're not likely to forget that it was originally built for the Sega Saturn. But if you're willing to learn to play by its rules, you'll find that Lara Croft's debut outing is still a satisfying adventure, and her quest to uncover an ancient treasure has become something of an ancient treasure all its own.","January 13, 2014","true","26.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Essentially the same great game if you previously played the PS version.  There are a few small cons with the PC Steam version, but they are nothing too big.\n\nCons:\n*Missing background music.  The original sounds are there such as gunfire, enemies, ambient, but it is missing the short musical background scores that would usually play during certain moments that would signal danger or caution that would keep you alert and ready for battle.  While nothing to fuss over, it is a bummer.\n\n*Resolution.  This one is hardly anything to get upset over since this game was never meant to be played in HD or widescreen resolution, so it does take a bit of messing around with the game settings to find the perfect resolution and to make the game fit onto the screen. (Even after setting it to my native 1080p resolution, the right side of my monitor would be black).  So you have to find what eventually will work for you.\n\nDespite this, the PROS are that this is a fantastic game (which for its time) has great level design, challenging puzzles, good story, a power-hungry antagonist, and will keep you immersed till the end.  Also, I'd say the PC version is much easier since you can save whenever you like vs the PS version where you needed to find save crystals.\n\nIf you are a Tomb Raider fan, you will definitely love the original if for some reason you have never played it, but played any other installment of the series.","April 1, 2015","true","19.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Visually it is very dated but, if you can look past that, the level design is excellent.  So are the story and dialogue.  Sadly I think overall the Playstation version is better than the PC version.  It has more music tracks (which are beautiful) and you can use a controller with more buttons.  Because the PC version is for DOS, you can only use a 4 button controller.  I imagine there is a way to use a controller with more buttons but it seems like a lot of hassle.  The PC version does have better graphics than the Playstation version.\n\nI recommend getting the Playstation version instead if you can.","April 23, 2015","true","1.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Essentially the same great game if you previously played the PS version.  There are a few small cons with the PC Steam version, but they are nothing too big.\n\nCons:\n*Missing background music.  The original sounds are there such as gunfire, enemies, ambient, but it is missing the short musical background scores that would usually play during certain moments that would signal danger or caution that would keep you alert and ready for battle.  While nothing to fuss over, it is a bummer.\n\n*Resolution.  This one is hardly anything to get upset over since this game was never meant to be played in HD or widescreen resolution, so it does take a bit of messing around with the game settings to find the perfect resolution and to make the game fit onto the screen. (Even after setting it to my native 1080p resolution, the right side of my monitor would be black).  So you have to find what eventually will work for you.\n\nDespite this, the PROS are that this is a fantastic game (which for its time) has great level design, challenging puzzles, good story, a power-hungry antagonist, and will keep you immersed till the end.  Also, I'd say the PC version is much easier since you can save whenever you like vs the PS version where you needed to find save crystals.\n\nIf you are a Tomb Raider fan, you will definitely love the original if for some reason you have never played it, but played any other installment of the series.","April 1, 2015","true","19.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's all about the tombs! Unlike the sequels, the original is pretty basic. No outfit changes or extenstive weapon arsenals. Instead, Lara sticks with only four weapons, each sort of acting like an upgrade from the other. Tomb Raider I puts little emphasis on action and focuses more on atmosphere. The effect pays off well allowing the player to experience plently of memorable moments right down to a T-REX in a lost valley all the way to an alien ooze fest in Atlantis. Cool!\n\nThe improvements in TR2-5 are mostly cosmetic and never did they drastically stray away from the formula TRI established. And why should they have?

This save mechanic makes the game so much better, as getting back to an area that is hard to get through, only to end up jumping and falling to your death for the 20th time gets old fast.  Save anywhere is much appreciated.  You can use it a lot or not much at all, which is awesome either way.\n\nAs for game controls, I am using a "SNES like" iBuffalo Classic usb Gamepad, Serial number A504510 with the JoyToKey gamepad free software for key mapping.

It is always nice to go back to the classics and remember how all of this amazing series of games started. This is basicly what the whole game is about:\n\nAt a hotel in present day Calcutta, Lara Croft is approached by an American named Larson Conway, who works for the wealthy businesswoman Jacqueline Natla, owner of Natla Technologies. At Natla's request, Lara sets out on an expedition to recover a mysterious artefact called the Scion from the lost tomb of Qualopec, in the mountains of Peru. After successfully retrieving the object, she is attacked by Larson who attempts to claim it. She beats him then questions him, learning that the artefact she has is only a fragment and that a man named Pierre Dupont has been hired by Natla to collect the rest.\n\nLara breaks into Natla Technologies to find out Pierre's whereabouts. She discovers a medieval monk's journal, which reveals the depths of an ancient monastery of St. Francis in Greece to house the tomb of Tihocan, a ruler of Atlantis, along with a second piece of the Scion. Traveling to the monastery, Lara descends through an expansive underground complex, pursued and attacked throughout by Pierre Dupont. At the tomb of Tihocan, Lara recovers the second piece of the Scion and finally kills Pierre. An inscription inside the tomb states that Tihocan was "one of the two just rulers" of Atlantis.\n\nWhen Lara joins the two pieces of the Scion, she receives a vision of the three Atlantean rulers and their respective pieces of the Scion. One of them utilises it to create a mutant breed, but the other two confront her, and take her piece of the Scion. Then Atlantis is struck by a fireball from the skies, and the three pieces of the Scion become scattered as the civilisation is destroyed. One of them goes to Egypt, Lara's next destination.\n\nLara travels to the City of Khamoon, a temple complex in Egypt that houses the final fragment. Here she battles the fierce mutants seen in her vision, and is once again confronted by Larson, this time in a battle to the death. She then takes the final piece of the Scion from the underground sanctuary. Upon leaving the tomb, she is ambushed by Natla and her henchmen, who steal the three artefacts and nearly kill her.\n\nHaving escaped, Lara stows away on their boat, which takes her to a remote island where mining operations of Natla Technologies have partially exposed the Great Pyramid of Atlantis. After making her way through the mines dispatching Natla's goons and the mutant-infested interior of Atlantis, Lara reaches the heart of the pyramid chamber, where the complete Scion has been fused together as a source of power. Touching it, Lara receives another vision, where Natla is revealed as the previously seen third ruler of Atlantis. She betrays her co-rulers by abusing the power of the Scion for genetic experimentation, and as punishment is locked in a stasis cell by Qualopec and Tihocan, her resting place until the prologue of the game.\n\nNatla enters the chamber and confronts Lara; having reclaimed the artifacts, she attempts to restore her former power with an army of mutants. Lara attempts to shoot the scion, Natla tackles her through the observation window. Natla falls into a crevasse, but Lara manages to land on the breeding platform, confronting Natla's largest mutant abomination. After defeating the monstrosity, she destroys the scion and attempts to escape the collapsing pyramid. As she makes her way out she meets Natla a final time, now mutated and winged. After beating her, Lara flees the island just as the place is destroyed.","July 17, 2015","true","5.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I remember loving this game back on the playstation as a kid. I think the game itself is escellent, and revolutionary, especially for its time. However, the game has aged very poorly. Compared to the most recent Tombraider games and the second generation Tombraider it just isn't worth it. This all leads to my main complaint. This is an awful port. The controls are really awkward and with no mouse compatability the camera is nearly impossible to control. That combined with already awkward combat and difficult platforming makes the game almost unplayable. I tolerated this for about two hours before getting a little frustrated. I went online to find that this, along with the other first generation Tombraider games, took about 20 hours to complete. I dcided I didn't have the patience to tolerate the clunky contrals for that long and give up. This is still an EXCELLENT game, and if you feel you have the patience for the contols, then go for it.","September 6, 2015","false","1.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sharuun/recommended/224960/","sharuun","No More Please","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sharuun/","205 products in account","This is one of those older games along with the original Sonic the Hedgehog and Metroid that happens to be mediocre, and no one ever really says it is. For some reason, these games are considered "classics", "timeless", and called the best games of all time. And I heavily disagree on Tomb Raider (1996) being considered one of the best games ever.\n\nI grew up on Anniversary, so as it usually is when I play a really good modern remake or sequel, and play its highly-praised  predecessor I end up very disappointed. Anniversary was alive with dynamic music, great characterization, and creative level design. And the original that it's based off of is... incredibly dull.\n\nNow, you might say I have no appreciation for older games, and need to praised them more for their "historic impact" on the gaming industry. A game could have certainly done a lot for the cause of gaming, but the games that have built off the foundations laid by these games and made something really special. Think about it. Do you, personally, know the first film ever made? The first Oscar winner? If so, do you consider them the among the likes of The Godfather and Citizen Kane? Of course not! Then why should we give so much credit to the original Super Mario Bros. and Grand Theft Auto III? They are fun, but they aren't anything special, like other much better-made games like The Last of Us or The Unfinished Swan.\n\nThe only problem with this for Tomb RaideR 96 is.... it's not even fun! The game felt more like a chore than an escapist video game that I could have fun playing, because everything is the game is so slow- from Lara's tank-like controls, her awkward and unpredictable jumping, and massive wait-time on pushing crates around. The puzzles in the games are a little challenging, but the main platforming of the game completely falls flat, since it's so stilted and strange to control. Even more so is the "combat", which is basically jumping and holding the "shoot" button until everyone in the cave/room/corridor is dead.\n\nThe sound is nearly inexistent. Sure, the sounds can be ambient and this was the 90's so games like these weren't that technologically impressive. But any ambience the music could possibly muster is brought down by the very short draw-distance, which breaks the illusion that the game I'm playing is a game. Especially when the characters have no personality behind the one line they speak in cutscenes. I liked Anniversary's take on the original, because Lara Croft was a complete badass. She would kill when necessary, and faced her obstacles with daring in the expressions she made on her face in the cutscenes. Sure, you could say, "Lara in the original Tomb Raider could have been easily replaced by a man, which shows that they've handled her well." But the whole marketing for Lara Croft is her very obvious sex appeal, and it was nice that she showed a lot more unique talents for her gender that she used to her advantage in Anniversary.\n\nI'm not saying I had Tomb Raider 96, either. It's just pretty average. But you have these die-hard fans that think it's superior to Underworld, Legend, and Anniversary- which had a better focus on character and story (again, they're not perfect either) which blew the simplistic, tomb-raiding 90's video game out of the water. If you like Tomb Raider, fine. I don't care. But I have my own standard for games, and if you haven't played Tomb Raider and have a feeling that your standards are similar to mine... you'll probably not enjoy this game like I didn't.","November 16, 2015","false","3.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It was great for it's day. It still is. My issue with the game is more technical though.\n\nFirst: This is a PSX to DOS port. The game literally starts it's own DOS prompt (using DOSbox) and launches. It does not run natively within windows. It's not a deal breaker, just annoying. In order to get the game into full screen or change any settings concerning graphics, input mapping, ect.... you have to alt+tab out of the game and get into DOSbox, change the settings you like, and then continue.\n\nSecond: DOSbox does not correctly recognize joysticks or controllers. I've been using my PS3 Sixaxis controller for playing many games. Almost all PC games I've played work just fine with the controller. Not so much with this game. In fact, only 4 buttons on my controller work.\n\nLastly: (And this is very important) There is no clear way that I have found to change the keyboard mapping. "WASD" can be set to move your character around, but you have to use buttons for the camera too! There is no mouse support for this game. (It runs in DOS) Which leaves you fumbling around just to make simple jumps. I never made it as far as any combat, though I'm sure that would have been a real pain in the rear.\n\nTo conclude: Skip this one. I got it as part of a bundle, so I don't feel too bad for grabbing it. But seriously, skip it. Find it elsewhere. Find a better port. Pull out that old grey PlayStation sitting in your closet and scrounge EBay for an origional disc. Just whatever you do, do not willingly buy this game.","September 30, 2015","false","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","3"

Thankfully there are mods to at least be able to run it at a higher resolution, but it's not going to make Lara Croft look any less blocky. The early Tomb Raider games developed by Core all have weird controls that will probably take some getting used to, but once you do, they're not too bad.

The levels can be huge, the puzzles daunting and without a map, the game can be a formidable challenge to the novice gamer - as it was even 20 years ago.\n\nLooking at Tomb Raider 1 in 2015 things like door switches can seem wholly illogical, even nonsensical. But approach each game level as a conceptual puzzle set-piece, and one can see it has more in common with games like The Talos Principle than the Tomb Raider reboot.\n\nThe player controls, considering the games age, have arguably aged well once you've mastered them. Compared to TR1's contemporaries such as Deathtrap Dungeon, Syphon Filter and Soul Reaver, Lara Croft's animations - to be able to somersault and shoot simultaneously (and later 360 degree turns in the air), were incredibly underrated and advanced for the time.\n\nTomb Raider 1 is a Classic in every sense. Gameplay, music and yes, the graphics, will always hold a special place in the hearts of adventure gamers the World over.","May 27, 2015","true","2.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Who would of thought the game would be about .....  haha got you there no spoilers.  Still the platforming is excellent and the learning curve is fair until you get to level 5 which really ramps up the difficulty.  I still think its better than 2 and 3 (Rev and Chronicles (Really an expansion to Rev) should of been the true sequel)\n\n2 is far to hard for first timers and sometimes pretty cryptic - dont get me started with 3....  Stupid monkies.\n\n4 weapons, Pistols, Magnums, Uzis and Shotgun.  All have its purpose in combat.  But the real purpose of the game is navigating the tombs and solving the door puzzles (all challenging and fair).\n\nBoss in final level has a hilarious death animation for Lara.\n\nIts truely a shame that CORE dont make the games anymore.  I wished they continued Angel of Darkness in memory of them.\n\nStill way better than Context Sensitive Raider - That game focused on more about combat than platforming and puzzle solving in a smaller scale.\n\n9/10","October 9, 2015","true","9.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

It was great for it's day. It still is. My issue with the game is more technical though.\n\nFirst: This is a PSX to DOS port. The game literally starts it's own DOS prompt (using DOSbox) and launches. It does not run natively within windows. It's not a deal breaker, just annoying. In order to get the game into full screen or change any settings concerning graphics, input mapping, ect.... you have to alt+tab out of the game and get into DOSbox, change the settings you like, and then continue.\n\nSecond: DOSbox does not correctly recognize joysticks or controllers. I've been using my PS3 Sixaxis controller for playing many games. Almost all PC games I've played work just fine with the controller. Not so much with this game. In fact, only 4 buttons on my controller work.\n\nLastly: (And this is very important) There is no clear way that I have found to change the keyboard mapping. "WASD" can be set to move your character around, but you have to use buttons for the camera too! There is no mouse support for this game. (It runs in DOS) Which leaves you fumbling around just to make simple jumps. I never made it as far as any combat, though I'm sure that would have been a real pain in the rear.\n\nTo conclude: Skip this one. I got it as part of a bundle, so I don't feel too bad for grabbing it. But seriously, skip it. Find it elsewhere. Find a better port. Pull out that old grey PlayStation sitting in your closet and scrounge EBay for an origional disc. Just whatever you do, do not willingly buy this game.","September 30, 2015","false","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","3"

This review also applies to Tomb Raiders II through IV, and probably V and VI as well though I haven't played them yet.\n\nThere isn't much to say about this game. The graphics are clearly something to sneeze at, and the audio is nearly nonexistant. There is no plot to speak of, and there isn't much variety in mechanics. The entire meat of this game is through the gameplay.\n\nTomb Raider I has some pretty solid gameplay, but this is only true when we recognize that the game was released in 1996.  The movements, while extremely clunky, give you a wide range of mobility options for each scenario. In terms of how this game is meant to be played, it is unlike any other game I've played before: instead of emphasizing reflexes, strategy, or problem solving, this game test the player's dedication and perception. You are tasked with exploring many different landscapes where all of the textures look very similar, and this game pushes this test of perception to an extreme. This game is not for the feint of heart, and I certainly did not enjoy it very much.\n\nSo why do I recommend it at all? Because I believe that it would be a very enjoyable experience in a group setting. If you have a team of people all soaking in your surroundings, you are much more likely to progress in the game, and find the crucial secrets that help you get extra medpacks. You can laugh at the corniness together, or maybe even try to progress through a level with everyone drunk. I believe that this would make a great game for a small friend group where everyone likes to experience new types of video games. The reason I did not enjoy the game when I played through it was because I was playing it alone, and heavily relied on a walkthrough so I wouldn't keep dying. But if you have some friends like on Game Grumps e.g., you can probably power through this game pretty quickly (and maybe have a walkthrough open just in case you guys get stuck as well).\n\nIf you haven't played a Tomb Raider game before, this might be worth picking up. Play it with friends.","February 29","true","18.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I remember loving this game back on the playstation as a kid. I think the game itself is escellent, and revolutionary, especially for its time. However, the game has aged very poorly. Compared to the most recent Tombraider games and the second generation Tombraider it just isn't worth it. This all leads to my main complaint. This is an awful port. The controls are really awkward and with no mouse compatability the camera is nearly impossible to control. That combined with already awkward combat and difficult platforming makes the game almost unplayable. I tolerated this for about two hours before getting a little frustrated. I went online to find that this, along with the other first generation Tombraider games, took about 20 hours to complete. I dcided I didn't have the patience to tolerate the clunky contrals for that long and give up. This is still an EXCELLENT game, and if you feel you have the patience for the contols, then go for it.","September 6, 2015","false","1.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I played my first Tomb Raider, which was Legend, when I was 15. However, I developed such a love for the series that I went back and purchased all of the original titles on the Playstation as well (actually, I have Chronicles on Dreamcast, but that's neither here nor there), and I must say that they are excellent even today. Thankfully, the PC version of TR1 allows you to save anywhere, unlike the PS1 version which utilizes save crystals. UGH, what a nightmare those were. They returned for the PS1 version of TR3 as well, which made playing it completely impossible for people like me. I have Windows 10, and the game runs perfectly on my computer, although I should mention that the emulation software DOSbox is what makes the game play. The FMV cutscenes look awful in this port, there's flickering all over, and it changes screen resolution every time it opens a new cutscene, causing my computer to pull up an ugly red box every time saying "This resolution is not optimal, blah blah blah." Thankfully I was able to find a way around this. The game runs smoothly, and looks miles better than the PS1 version on it's own, although it could look better. I got this game with every other TR game in the TR Collection, currently on sale for only $16! Money well spent IMO, just upset that it didn't come with Temple of Osiris, I had to buy that seperately. *shrugs*","September 30, 2015","true","14.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Not a deal breaker, because it never happens to me during gameplay only when I'm trying to get back into windows.  I still have not found an easy way to play Tomb Raider in windowed mode.\n\nYou have 16 "save anywhere" files.  This save mechanic makes the game so much better, as getting back to an area that is hard to get through, only to end up jumping and falling to your death for the 20th time gets old fast.  Save anywhere is much appreciated.  You can use it a lot or not much at all, which is awesome either way.\n\nAs for game controls, I am using a "SNES like" iBuffalo Classic usb Gamepad, Serial number A504510 with the JoyToKey gamepad free software for key mapping.

I played my first Tomb Raider, which was Legend, when I was 15. However, I developed such a love for the series that I went back and purchased all of the original titles on the Playstation as well (actually, I have Chronicles on Dreamcast, but that's neither here nor there), and I must say that they are excellent even today. Thankfully, the PC version of TR1 allows you to save anywhere, unlike the PS1 version which utilizes save crystals. UGH, what a nightmare those were. They returned for the PS1 version of TR3 as well, which made playing it completely impossible for people like me. I have Windows 10, and the game runs perfectly on my computer, although I should mention that the emulation software DOSbox is what makes the game play. The FMV cutscenes look awful in this port, there's flickering all over, and it changes screen resolution every time it opens a new cutscene, causing my computer to pull up an ugly red box every time saying "This resolution is not optimal, blah blah blah." Thankfully I was able to find a way around this. The game runs smoothly, and looks miles better than the PS1 version on it's own, although it could look better. I got this game with every other TR game in the TR Collection, currently on sale for only $16! Money well spent IMO, just upset that it didn't come with Temple of Osiris, I had to buy that seperately. *shrugs*","September 30, 2015","true","14.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Lara Croft is hired by a wealthy woman to find 3 pieces of an ancient pendant. Along the way, she encounters strange discoveries, led-filled betrayals and terrifying enemies, leading her to unravel a great mystery that was supposed to remain in the past.\n\nEven today this game is amazing: levels are interesting and challenging, Lara's movement is detail-rich and precise and puzzles are well-though and rewarding. the first TR plays more like an action version of chess, where every movement and jumping must be precise, and the player must progress slowly and with a plan ahead. PC version of the game, without patches or mods, has no in-game music, but that only strengthens the atmosphere of exploration and trepidation while you encounter the next challenge.\n\nWhile the graphics are simple by today's standards, they do their job well in portraying the feel of Hollywood adventure movies. Lara's movement however is great, with an emphasis on small details as she moves and fights. The combat is on the other hand slow and clunky, and it has not aged that well as the other aspects of the game have.\n\nThe story has a great setup, but as it develops, it remains shallow and short. Design of the main antagonists is great though, still inspiring that same sense of dread, repulsion and other-worldliness. The pinnacles of artistic design are the last two levels that feel amazing and strange at the same time.\n\nTomb Raider is a great game despite its flaws and age and all would-be archaeologists with a lasso and a dusty fedora owe to themselves to play it.

It's all all-time classic, considered a milestone in graphics and inventive gameplay, and helped shape the beloved tradition of starring eye-pleasing females in video games.\n\nIs it worth revisiting? Yes and no. The levels are incredibly repetitive; cave walls and temples are all you will see. You will spend hours dragging blocks and running back and forth between switches, ever finding little if any resistance from enemies. Also, are 4 different weapons really enough in our homicidal gaming world? You don't even get the uzis until the 12th level! The challenge lies in the unforgivable controls, where delayed jumping mechanics and treacherous distances make a two-headed monster you will come to respect, love and hate.\n\nI feel that rating this game above the sequel, Tomb Raider 2, would be based on sentiment rather than content, but that remains one guy's opinion. Even if it is a good one. In conclusion: the game is definitely worth replaying for those of us who had the chance to experience the golden era of PS1, but I would not recommend this game to a new player, even if they are into the franchise.\n\nGroke out!","January 23","true","14.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Drakevarg/recommended/224960/","Drakevarg","Drakevarg","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Drakevarg/","94 products in account","The original Tomb Raider is certainly a mixed bag. It's not really a contentious observation to say that the controls are completely awful, as Lara handles about as gracefully as a cow on a forklift, courtesy of her tank controls, but the actual gameplay once you get the hang of it is actually quite fun.\n\nOne thing I quite liked about this game's story compared to the general perception of Lara Croft these days, is that for all intents and purposes Lara is NOT a hero. Protagonist, sure, but she's depicted here as a callous adrenaline junkie who is roped into the plot strictly through the promise of thrills, and sticks it through to the end basically just to spite the people who tried to kill her.\n\nI actually found this characterization fairly interesting, and was glad to see that in truth Lara does in fact have a personality outside of her bust size (which never much mattered to me, personally I think her most attractive physical asset would be her toned abs, which soften out after the third game in favor of a more generic swimsuit physique). Shame it meant so little to the developers and the public consciousness that each reboot of Lara might as well be an entirely different person.\n\nThe game actually shows quite a bit of restraint throughout, and while you do gun down dozens of endangered animals throughout the adventure, the body count is much, much lower than an equivalent game made today would ever be. Your final human kill count by the end is SIX (or even five depending on how you classify the final boss), and even the animals you kill are largely brief encounters with one or two at a time to keep you on your toes - for the most part the game is content to let you solve the platforming puzzles in peace.\n\nThe game's biggest flaw, as is a sad recurrance, is its final level. Tomb Raider's interpretation of Atlantis is certainly a new one - gilded Ry'leh isn't something I expected - but let's set some new standards, alright? Developers: you're not allowed to set your final level inside a colon anymore. I know you're trying to go for an offputting atmosphere, but it looked like crap in Halo 3, it looked like crap in Tomb Raider, it looked like crap in Half-Life, and it looked like crap every time it was done in Dead Space.\n\nBut that's not the issue I have with the final level. The issue is quite simply that it's not very well designed. From the start I picked up on the feeling that the developers were starting to run out of ideas, with nonsensical puzzles that couldn't be passed off as ancient puzzle-based security systems, but it was around the penultimate boss fight and afterwards that cinched the deal: medpacks basically stop being a thing. I managed to get a pretty good distance without needing to heal through skill and perseverance, but in the end I had to give up and watch the ending cutscene on YouTube (since I couldn't get the level skip cheat to work).\n\nBeing down to essentially my last sliver of health, the game had suddenly turned into I Wanna Be The Guy as every trap would kill me instantly, and certain drops became literally impossible as I couldn't even handle the minute damage from falling that far. I suspect this is a typical side effect of the developers running out of time or money or energy for proper playtesting and rushing the product to shelves. In the end though I had a lot of fun with this, even if I couldn't experience the last 20-odd minutes of gameplay myself.","January 19","true","17.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Also it handles like a tank, but the controls aren't as bad as others say. Customise them yourself and it's easily playable. If you've played this years ago and enjoyed it, you'll probably still like it now.\nThere's still a solid game in there. It lacks the excitement of the more modern games in the series, so you might feel like your grinding it out in certain areas, but again, it's an oldie, so you can't fault it for that.\nIf you were too young to have played this when it was released or didn't play any of the games in the original series, I'd advise skipping this.

Missed jumps to death can ruin an hour of work! The PC version is kinder though, and lets you save anywhere which makes things considerably easier.

To fix the resolution issues, go into your Steam folder and into the Tomb Raider (I) directory. Open up the dosboxTR.conf file as well as the glide.ini file. In the dosbox file, if you want to run the game in full screen at a better resolution, change full screen = true rather than false and change the "fullresolution" to a resolution you prefer. Then go into the glide.ini file and change "resolution" from 0.0 to the resolution width (i.e. 1280x720). You should be good to go. You have to change your settings in this folder because for some reason, changing the settings directly from the game window doesn't save properly. If you also want to use a controller for this game, I highly recommend using a program called "xpadder". You can map your controls based on your keyboard, since this game does not have controller support. Besides these issues, the game runs great and you cannot go wrong with a classic Tomb Raider game.","January 1","true","13.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
