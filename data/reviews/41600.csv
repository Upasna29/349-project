The PC version has several flaws, The camera controls are awful, the music doesn't exist (In all honesty, You wont notice after awhile as there is still ambient noises), and a game breaking bug.\n\nThe game breaking bug, is that you need 74 Golden udders to win, But sometimes even if you collect them all, it still states you only have 73. This is fixable however, If you head back to Fear - poultrygeist - Try to recollect the udders you already have. One will activate again and you will have 6/5. If that doesn't work, Do the same in Boogie Nights.\n\nThis and starshot are the two main games i remember that i struggled with as a kid, Coming back was an interesting experience. I'm not sure if it's the nostalgia talking, however i did find the overall game enjoyable, Even though the boss battles are like beating yourself in the face with a brick.  Overall: You are not missing out on a lot if you don't buy it, But it certainly is a blast from the past.  8/10","July 4, 2014","true","19.2"," 13 of 22 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","13","22","0","0"

I find myself asking this question, having completed Earthworm Jim 3D.\n\nForget about comparing this game to the 2D entries of the series.  This game is nothing like its 16-bit predecessors.  Judging this game simply on the merits of platformers from the N64 era of platformers reveals a competent game filled with silly humor and dated pop culture references.  Controls and gameplay are reminiscent of Nintendo's own platform-centric franchises of the era.  The aesthetic closely resembles the Earthworm Jim TV show and holds up nicely, even by today's HD standards.  The voice work and sound effects give the game a unique personality and a real throwback quality.  The game is retro without being retro, if that makes any sense.\n\nI rented this game on the N64 when it was first released.  I remember not enjoying it.  Part of the reason must have been nostalgia-induced and longing for a continuation of the 2D games.  Fast forward to today.  I feel like I was finally able to accept Earthworm Jim 3D for what it is and appreciate the efforts that went into attempting to keep the franchise relevant.  Maybe it has been so long since I played a platformer like this my standards have reset.  I cannot pinpoint exactly why this game is so enticing now.  All I know is I like it--and that's what counts!\n\nNow, there are three issues I would like to point out for those considering purchasing this game.  One issue is inherent with the gameplay and that issue is the camera.  Early 3D, third-person perspective games usually suffered from awkward camera implementation.  The way in which the camera follows Jim will result in a constant need to adjust it.  There are adequate camera controls that allow the player to manipulate the position of the camera, but far too much time will be spent adjusting its placement.  Be prepared to play with the camera often.\n\nThe next two issues are more technical drawbacks.  First, the music for this game is not included in the Steam download.  While this enhances attention to the voice work and sound effects, this will undoubtedly be a sorely missed feature of the game.  In addition to the complete absence of the soundtrack, there are numerous locations in the game where the audio will cut out.  Luckily, there is a fix for these audio woes; there are threads in the Community Hub that will direct you where you need to go and what to do.  I would encourage anyone who purchases this game to take the additional steps and download the music.  The game's identity is incomplete without it.  Returning the soundtrack to the game also fixes the areas where audio would previously cut out.\n\nThe second issue may or may not be encountered.  In my first playthrough, I collected all the Golden Udders only to find the game miscalculated my totals from each level.  This prevented me from reaching the end of the game. :(\n\nStill, what the game offers is a satisfying platforming experience.  It does not win any awards for level design or control, but everything about the game is functional.  The story is inconsequential at best.  Whether Jim is knocked out by an N64 logo or a refrigerator, the premise that facilitates the gameplay is lame.  :D\n\nMaybe that's a fitting conclusion.  Earthworm Jim 3D features a lame super hero tasked with saving himself for lame reasons from lame villains in what could be perceived as a lame game.  The beauty of it all is it works!  The universe of Earthworm Jim is self-aware, lending Earthworm Jim 3D a pass to be the game you want it to be.  It may have taken 15 years, but I chose to embrace the ridiculousness of this game and give it another try.  I am glad I did.","January 5, 2015","true","29.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It seems most vulernable to this in the hub world or paused.  Also, the game will not save video / control settings.\n\nIf you don't have a Nintendo system, you have a limited selection of animated 3D platformers.  This game scratches the itch quite nicely with it's qwerky sense of humor and Free-Range Exploration.  And although it's easier than it's 16 bit counterparts and utilizes auto and manual saving, like most games from the 90s, it will challenge you with unforgiving collecting requirements and limited lives.  It ran smoothly on my Windows XP 1.8ghz system.  Bring your own music because it's been removed, evidentally, for copyright reasons.  Also, although I could save the game, it didn't seem to save my control and video settings.  I managed some permanent custom controls including turbo whip and camera by keyboard mapping to my controller using xpadder.  A very underrated title.

Configuration's rather wonky too, and Jim feels more stiff in this than the genesis version of ewj1.  You are basically paying for 3 half-♥♥♥♥♥ ports. One funny thing is that the pictures you see for ewj1 in steam are from the genesis version and even show pictures of levels that were cut out from the game they are actually selling. I at least learned a lesson that if you're going to buy a port of a game, you should do more research on it first before paying. Stay away from these ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ports.

The platforming stages are decent enough but the boss fights are ATROCIOUS: you and your opponent duke it out in an exciting contest of... collecting orbs scattered about in the arena. With really awkward controls, the boss constantly shooting you causing you to drop your orbs, and the fact that you still have your health to worry about (whilst the boss can take as many shots they want without even caring) all combine to create a really unpleasant experience.\n\nSo, if you have a desperate need for a 3D collect-a-thon platformer and have already played the likes of Banjo-Kazooie, Jak & Daxter, and Ty the Tasmanian Tiger, then I might cautiously recommend you play this title, but I wouldn't recommend it to a fan of Earthworm Jim, unless you REALLY like Dan Castellaneta as the voice of Jim or something.\n\nOh yeah, and the keyboard and mouse controls are trash. Use a directinput controller for this one, since I don't think it appreciates the Xbox 360's analogue shoulder button things.\n\nBut hey, I think it's at least better than Earthworm Jim: Menace 2 The Galaxy.","October 21, 2015","false","2.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Sometimes the enemies can't even be seen because of the horrible camera angle, and sometime platforming is a complete chore - especially with wonky keyboard controls.\nThe graphics, combat, and sound are decent, but that's it. Nothing crazy or incredibly creative like its predecessors.\nEarthworm Jim 3D just seems to exist to make someone want to play its predecessors. Maybe if the controls were improved and there was just a little more creativity, that wouldn't be the case. However, now I have to feel bad for the Earthworm Jim franchise.","September 7, 2015","false","0.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Horribly ported but otherwise a pretty good game.\n\nIf you liked mario64 or banjo kazooie this could be right up your ally, it's not as good as those games but its not far behind either. Downvote for the horrible port, as it is a pretty good game.","August 27, 2015","false","12.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is literally the worst game I've ever played. I hope you like boring gameplay, no music, and the worst boss fights in the history of the ♥♥♥♥ing world because this is it. Did I mention if you leave a level you lose all your collectables? So if you don't save, you have to start the level ALL OVER AGAIN!
