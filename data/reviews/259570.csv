I very much enjoyed the first few times playing, however i have noticed as few things that i would caution you to either to consider prior to buying or prior to playing for the first time.\n\nfirst i have heard from people who have played the game that is it almost tediously easy. however i must have started playign after the patch because i found the game so grueling at night that every playthrough ends up exactly the same:\nDay1-collect eden, collect materials for building, then build a base\nNight1- continue collecting maerials for building because NOTHING will attack you the first night (unless provoked)\nDay2- keep on collecting and building (dont forget to upgrade eden with spare material)\nNight2- Crap your pants as onslaughts of aliens attack from all sides; barely survive\nDay3- cry a little as you see all the work put into harvesting and buiding was just destroyed in one night, but you continue to collect and build anyway.\nNight3- stock up ammo and energy because you will die. and if you dont, you will be left with a 80% destroyed base and will most certainly die on Night 4.\n\nSo, although it is fun and exciting the first few playthroughs, eventually you will get discouraged because everything you do will all end on night 3 (possibly 4). And if you were wondering about more specifics of me trying to survive will no prevail: Ive tried mulpiple "strategic" base locations, (backed up againt a mountain/cliff, away from enemy hives,up high where they cant reach me) but they get you either way. not only do they seem to spawn in on my base at night, but it also seems that killing one of there hives (which should stop them from coming from said hive since its ...well...dead) doesnt not stop them from pouring in from that dead hive. I also tried to purely harvest and save resources from day 1 until day 4 then build a grand fortrace thinking i would be ahead of the game and they wouldnt be able to take out a large base with walls and blockades and six turrets and me ....but they did. they destroyed everything. and killed me.\n\nI know much of this sounds negative, but i truly do enjoy the game. it just has some quirks that make it hard to keep replaying for me personally. i really hope that the creators keep doing a great job and continue to progres with this game.\n\nOne last thing....\nIf you were wondering what i would want to be better or worked on, this is it:\n-more varied % for harvesting . ei. maybe a different type of tree that is  a higher percentage of the wood (protanium or whatever) and rocks that would all range in % not just 25 or 30%.\n-not easier aliens, just more timely placed or spaced out. The first night being alien free is sweet, however a barrage on night 2 and getting harder form there is kind of sudden. maybe ease into heavier waves or more aggressive aliens? it would deffinetly increase my play time and willingness to go to such lengths to build a solid base.\n-better turrets. i know this one is odd but i have run into a problem that i dont really like or trust turrets to do their one job, which is shoot at the enemy. Which i cant trust them because they dont seem to do much damage anyway and only half the time they even work; i feel like an alien needs to be directly in front of a turret and not moving to be able for the turret to do any real damage. in the end im just lapping my base killing everything i can while i hear the turrets turn on and off for no reason. can turrets just be on and on guard at night and off during the day? cuz that would be pretty cool.\n-a different "start" location at random. the map doesnt seem to change and i pretty much know where to go from the start so maybe making the pods land in different areas of the map would be cool.","February 15, 2015","true","12.1"," 92 of 97 people (95%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","95","92","97","5","1"

It was using the Unreal Engine 3, and now they're using the Unreal Engine 4, but did it change much in terms of how it plays out? only a tiny bit.\n\nThis is their very first release of the game to the public (aside from that tech demo), which is really early, where you go and build an 'Eden' which protects you from the night damaging atmosphere, and it's also your main point of where you can construct structures, weapons, tools, and powers. And you have to protect it from the creatures it lures in the night, by constructing defenses (walls), turrets to shoot them, guns for you to shoot them, and new powers to destroy them, OR use your telekinetic melee powers to hold them, and then smash them in the direction of you choosing, to the closest hard object that will deal massive damage.\n\nThat's the game at the moment, gather resources, build stuff, protect and attack, but how good is it? well to me, it has the good looks, although a higher field of vision would help in making the world feel bigger, it's relatively easy to get into and have a good game going with how simple you get the resources, and then craft the structures you want, but all that is low in performance to what I think the game does extremely well, and that is its melee combat system with how amazing awesome it plays out, and that's what lured me to the game in the first place.\n\nThe developers really have a great thing going on Eden Star with its satisfying melee combat system, keep on improving it, making it more awesome with a lot of more fun way to go on wrecking havoc on enemies with it, and honestly without that combat system, the game would be another survival horde mode type of game, so keep on improving and adding on on that combat system devs!\n\nBut at the current moment of the game, is it worth playing it? it depends. If you think it looks cool and really want to try it out, sure go ahead, but how I see it, the game will be at its finest when it's out, or near release out of development, with a good story and progression to go along with it. I see this as a structured sand'boxed' experience, with a path drawn for you to walk in, but that path is really wide for you to move around comfortably. So again, if you want to check it out, go ahead, but if you want the experience that the developers (I would presume) want you to play through, then I'd advise of waiting for the release.\n\nShameless link[www.ksalue.com] to original post.","January 31, 2015","true","0.2"," 57 of 65 people (88%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","88","57","65","8","8"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Zastier/recommended/259570/","Zastier","Zastier","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Zastier/","274 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nCurrently, Eden Star is a game with some incredibly amusing concepts, great visuals and suprising amounts of polish considering its an Early Access tittle still being in early alpha. Currently, the main aspect of the game is building and protecting a base in a tower defense esque setting. Starting out, you will spawn in a pretty small world of floating isles, having the ability to collect resources trying to set up a small base before the first night. You do so using a system reminiscent of Rust or Ark: Survival Evolved which is quite well implemented in this game. You will be able to roam the world using the suprisingly competent parkour movement, avoiding being mauled by enemies roaming the world. On your travels you will be able to harvest resources that can be used to build up your base and craft new gear for your character. Af it stands, the content that is there is fairly solid and is quite well implemented with some nice modeling and animations on your enemies, very simple to understand buildign and material mechanics and simplified crafting systems making the mechanic a fun method of progressing rather than a tedious bore.\n\nThis is however where the good things about the game end as the amount of content currently avaiable is rather slim. Yes, there is a fairly nice variety of resources and structures you can build to defend your self from the incoming enemies, however you will find that the enemy variety it self is limited to a few monsters. The amount of things to do simply seems too small for the amount of time the game expects you to spend preparing for enemy attacks. Yes you can build up your defences, however I found that the amount of enemies that attack you at night is not big enough to pose a threat and while it might increase slowly over time, I found that its too slow allowing you to greatly outmatch the upcoming waves removing challenge from the equation.\n\nTo summarise, while the amount of content is fairly small, the quality of the content that is there is mostly outstanding. This game has a lot of potential, with the quality of the content thats there, I am having no doubpts about this game becoming something great. If you don't mind the lack of features, I'd say give it a go and see if you enjoy it your self.","December 26, 2015","true","4.1"," 42 of 42 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","42","42","0","0"

This game is Minecaft with a Sanctum twist.\n\nThe game is as visually pleasing as it is fluid in movement. You have the parkour abilities necessary to climb almost anything, which makes the game a whole lot more interesting. You can wall-run and shoot down aliens that are attacking you and your base. The game is also very physics oriented which means destroying something from the base topples the entire structure.\n\nSo far I have only seen 3 aliens, but there might be more, since the game seems to be infinitely-generated. There are 2 weapons for the player to use, a pistol (which you start with) and an assault rifle. As for defending your 'Eden Kit' (which is your life-support), you can craft 4 (or 5, I can't remember) defensive structures. The game also has basic parts for making a base. On that note, building in this game works very well, I was able to adjust the orientation of everything I placed to whatever I needed.\n\nFrom what I have read on the forums' this dev-team only releases updates when they are certain it is as far developed as possible, which makes for a far better play experience compared to indie titles that release buggier updates and simply fix them over time.\n\nAll-in-all this is an incredible title, all it is missing (in my opinion) is a multiplayer, which would make this one of my top 10 favorite games. I definitely recommend buying, and playing, this game!","July 3, 2015","true","3.8"," 44 of 48 people (92%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","92","44","48","3","2"

It's fast paced with a 15 minute "Day" cycle to use for exploration, material gathering, indiginious pacification and building your Eden Complex, and a 3 minute "Night" cycle where your Eden Complex becomes key, defend it, repair it or hide in it. There is much to learn, much to discover and much to upgrade to survive. Despite having an excellent guide and ingame tutorial, be prepared to have several short unsuccessful games at first while you experiment and find out what works and what does not, because what may seem like a simple plan that obviously should work may not!

But once you learn the map a little, and figure out proper base placement and enemy capabilities, you gain a huge advantage. It's already fun as it is, albeit somewhat bare-bones, and a little buggy, but the developers seem to be dedicated to making it better. Looking at their Trello board only makes me more excited, seeing the new enemies, biomes and equipment that's upcoming.\nIf you're undecided, there's plenty of videos up on youtube about this game, and check the aforementioned Trello board, and bookmark it.\nIn short, If the devs keep this up, this one is definitely going to be a major contender.","February 26, 2015","true","150.3"," 26 of 28 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","26","28","0","0"

You'll be tossed into an alien planet, gathering resources to craft defenses for your base, as during the night you could potentially get swamped by waves of enemies. Besides the danger of facing hoards of mobs, you'll also be exposed to toxic air, as the atmosphere of the planet turns toxic when the sun sets.\n\nThough the game states that it's a survival game, from my experience I feel that it's not a "true" survival game. There's no hunger, or thirst meter, and you don't go around the map collecting scattered objects. Every thing you need is all crafted. I would compare Eden Star to Minecraft much more than DayZ. I think when the devs mentioned survival they were referring to the base defense aspect, and perhaps the toxic air during the nights.\n\nThe flow of the game is this: During the day you'll explore the map, gathering as much materials as possible, and when night falls you'll be under the protection of your base from the toxic air, while crafting defensive items, such as walls, weapons, and sentries to help you defend, that's if you're lucky to get a night where you're not hounded by waves of enemies. If that is the case, you'll probably be spending the night fending off mobs and making repairs.\n\nIn it's current state, Eden Star is very playable, with enough features and functions for the player to explore, and it's also quite stable with out any crashes and a mostly consistent frame rate. But, being in early access, at the point of this impression the game does lack an "end game". Once you have every thing you need crafted with a well fortified base, there's not really much more to do. Couple this with the game's lack of save function, the player may lose interest much sooner than the game intends.\n\nThe game looks good overall, using the unreal4 engine and does a good job at conveying the alien landscape. I don't have much complaints about the games visuals, though a more robust options with better graphic settings would be welcomed.\n\nOverall, Eden Star looks like it has a lot of potential with an interesting premise for a crafting game. I would love to see the game live up to it's "survival" description a little more, but here's hoping in future patches, we'll see more of that aspect come to light. It's an intriguing entry into the genre, and at the very least, worth keeping an eye on.\n\nImpression written on version: 0.0.1.9005\n\nPros:\n- Good looking landscape\n- Base defense is a lot of fun\n- Good crafting system\n- Playable and stable\n\nCons:\n- Lacks content and an "end game"\n- I don't feel like it lives up to the "survival" description currently\n- underwhelming options menu","February 3, 2015","true","9.4"," 30 of 36 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","30","36","0","2"

But what separates it from the all the rest that are vying for your hard-earned money are some nice twists, a unique combat system, and a futurisitc sci-fi setting. (okay, GRAV has that last one but BitMonster,Inc really dropped the ball with their futuristic survival game)\nIt’s worth noting at this point that Eden Star is in a very early alpha state and that there is a LOT of content that needs to be added. At the moment I’d say that there’s about 2-4 hours worth of gameplay (depending how much you like base building). But even in its current state it's good fun, it has a solid gameplay foundation, and has a vast amount of potential. Moreover, the devs seem genuinely passionate about their creation, are continually keeping us updated with their plans and their progress, and are very good at replying to comments in the forums.\n\nSo, Eden Star has a unique combat system that involves grabbing enemies with your telekinetic device and then throwing them in a chosen direction. This brings no end of fun, as you can launch them soaring up high into the air only to have them plummet and splat back onto the ground several moments later (okay, the devs haven’t added a nice squishy “splat” yet). After grabbing you can also quickly turn around and cast individual aliens off a cliff and watch them disappear down into the misty abyss below, or (and my personal favourite) you can grab one alien bug and use it to smash another one in a truly delightful process that hasn’t ceased to amuse me.\nIn addition to the grab and smash approach, your equipment has an energy blast weapon that does exactly what it says to the alien creatures. This can be upgraded through unlocks to increase the power and duration of the blast so that it becomes a concentrated beam of searing energy. Thus adding another unique feature to this genre.\nThe final part of (the current) combat are the more traditional weapons (currently just a pistol and an assault rifle), which help to complete the FPS aspect of the game. (There’s a rather nice looking sniper rifle on the Eden Star drawing board, and there are plans for grenades too)\n\nHarvesting resources is an essential part of the survival genre, and here Eden Star provides another variation on the theme. Instead of hacking away at rocks and trees with hammers and axes you use your energy harness tool to disintegrate and extract materials from their surroundings. Large rock formations slowly fall to pieces as the “tractor beam” wrenches them out of place and into your inventory.\nIt’s actually quite satisfying to watch a tree crumble under gravity and disintegrate in front of you as you harvest the materials and energy from it with your high-tech resource gathering tool. What makes this even greater is that you can upgrade this, as well, to make harvesting faster and also to allow you to perform it from a greater distance from the target material. I really do love the unlockable and upgradeable features they’ve included so far.\n\nAn interesting twist to the genre appears upon nightfall. Whereas Savage Lands brings a terribly bitter cold that forces you to seek shelter and huddle around a campfire to which you cling for dear life, and The Forest plunges you into true pitch black conditions in a hostile woodland, Eden Star brings something new to the table. As well as an increase in enemy activity (this is when you’ll be doing the most of your tower defence of your base) night time brings a potentially lethal exposure to radiation that compels you to withdraw and find refuge under the protective umbrella of your base’s energy shield. Keep an eye on the planet’s local time because you will need to get back to safety before you become fatally irradiated and/or before the hostile indigenous life rips your base to shreds.\n\nVery briefly, the base building is excellent so far and seems to be a futuristic version of Rust. Eden Star allows you to build floors, walls, and ceilings separately so that you can construct your base exactly how you want it. No prefabricated rooms or buildings that constrict your creative freedom here!\n\nObviously, because this is still very early access I will be updating this review in the future after the devs have released significant updates. But for the time being I’m giving Eden Star a definite thumbs up!\n\nThings I would like/need to see developed for the final game include:\n- More action. Many more hostile life forms that are more threatening, thus deepening the FPS and tower defence aspects of the game to develop it into a true survival experience. The world is a little tame at the moment.\n- More types of defence towers and the addition of traps to defend your base during the night time attacks.\n- More fauna. Hostile, neutral, and friendly to enhance the feeling of the environment and the immersive atmosphere.\n- More geological feature. E.g. caves, water systems, impassable cliffs, geothermal pits, volcanoes - again to improve the environment further and to provide some unique locations for exploration.\n- Some sort of story and quests (i.e. an end game scenario). E.g. destroy all enemy life to make the planet habitable for your race to colonise. Or survive long enough to build a shuttle to escape from the hostile world on which you’ve been stranded. These are just my ideas.\n\n\n*** 21st December 2015 Update ***\n\n- A new energy blade melee weapon (that's rather reminiscent of Star War's light sabres). This is really good fun to use, it sounds absolutely fantastic (although quite a few ingame sounds are still buggy), and it really adds to the futuristic setting of Eden Star.\n- Two new enemies, the best of which is a particularly agressive flying creature that will suicide bomb attack your eden kit if you're not careful. It'll also dive attack you as well, knocking you back quite a distance.

At a mechanics level I do enjoy it, however beyond the well done building system and interesting mining system there is currently nothing to this game.\n\nThere are very few things to build or upgrade, either for you or your base. There is virtually no threat, walking during the daytime or sitting at your base at night. I found I had no issue staying alive at night with a single turret planted in the dirt by my Eden Center. Regardless of the lack-of-threat I built a base, which was enjoyable in and of itself. However, unlike more fleshed out games in this genre, there was nothing to put  in  the base! The only thing you can build for utility is power generators, which power your turrets, which protect an empty metal shell of a base.\n\nIf you check out their website you can see the content in work of the game. This is good because they really need to build what they have. However if everything they currently have planned for the game made it in tomorrow, I'm not sure how many hours more I could milk out of the game.\n\nAll in all, I would hold off, it's not worth more than an hour or two in its current state.

This review will contain what I've learned from my 15+hrs of playing the game.\n\nEden Star is, currently, an Early Access game about a character who crashes on an alien planet and must find specific parts from an object called the Eden Kit. The tutorial gives you everything you need to know on how to play the game from start to finish.\n\nThe game is created through the Unreal 4 Engine. The engine has great potential, and the developers have given the game rather nice texures for obvious reasons.\n\nYou begin the game falling from the sky and landing in a pod of some kind. As the door shoots open you are greeted to the alien planet along with a fiery sky show of fallen ship parts. Your goal is to go and retrieve an Eden Kit to call your home.\n\nAfter building a base out of trees, rocks and other minerals you can gather, it should soon be night time. During this time you will want to stay near  your Eden Kit and inside of your bubble to keep your shield up and to stay safe from enemies that will come for your Eden Kit's power. Once your power is destroyed so is your respawn point.\n\nYou are able to build guns, augments, upgrades, and eventually armor for your character to defend themselves with. You may also build defence weapons for your base like turrents and electrified fencing.\n\nPros:\n+Great controles and rebinding capability\n+Ajustable resolutions\n+Great crafting system/UI\n+Amazing replayability\n+Perfect atmosphere\n+Multiplayer\n+Range of graphics options\n+Beautiful visuals/graphics\n\nCons:\n+Can sometimes lag on max settings (980ti GPU)\n\nBugs/Glitches:\n+Specific area of the map that allows your Eden Kit to never be attacked.\n\nOverall this game is a lot like Subnautica but, better in my opinion. It is a very fun game to waste time or let's play for a YouTube channel. If this game was played by a famous let's player it would get a lot of traffic.\n\nI give this game an 9/10!

It combines so many strange crazy ideas such as Minecraft, mirrors edge, mass effect and survival and somehow pulls it off but not just that it does it so well. The point of the game is that you are whoever you think your character is future Steve, Commander Shepard, a dog in a space suit, and you must survive as long as you can. Think Minecraft but with a survival mode during the night. During the night monsters will emerge and attempt to attack your base's heart the Eden Kit. The Eden Kit is important because it is responsible for three things. It allows you to respawn, it creates a shield that blocks out the radiation of the night which will eat away at your shield and it helps you regen health which as far as I can tell cannot be regenerated any other way. Also you die easy. The world is huge and it contains a gorgeous landscape that you could spend hours exploring and admiring. Even now though I have seen a lot of the environment it still makes me go wow as the colours and designs and contrasts are perfect. The render distance also helps as you can see so far and see so much. There are many puzzles comprised of jumps and plat forming however there is a free running mechanic. The free running mechanic is almost as good as mirrors edge the only problem is that the game doesn't run at 60 fps for me so it is a bit clunky but otherwise reminiscent of mirrors edge (which had one of the best free running system I have ever used that put assassins creed to shame). The crafting though simplistic is still detailed and very creative you have four different types of building shapes. Primitive which are simply cubes that can be crafted out of several materials, panels which is self-explanatory which can be made of many materials as well. Foundations which you use to create a flat area to build your base on and finally ramps which are ramps shocking I know.  The game also comes which a weapon system and upgrade system. So far there are few upgrades and only 2 weapons. A pistol and rifle. Yet the aiming feels precise and the weapons powerful while the upgrades feel effective. The respawn system is my favorite out of every game ever as it is good but so devilish. You use this material called tesliuim which is used also to increase the shield radius of your Eden Kit and it is used to respawn however it requires one but since there are no chest or other storage containers if you die you lose all your materials, blocks and ammo. So might as well be carrying 1 tesliuim but happily you keep all your weapons and upgrades. There is some much more to Eden Kit and there is some much is being added for example the developers have considered adding a multiplayer which sounds amazing.This game has so much potential it’s crazy especially because the concept is so strange. It is one of those ideas that if pulled off right will be just the best. Please check this game out at least go on YouTube and watch some gameplay because even if it never gets updated again it is worth the money. Have a great day and never stop gaming ever. Well unless you need a break.\nNOTE TO DEVELOPERS: Excuse me developers if/when you add multiplayer please make it private so friends can invite each other their games cause otherwise we will get what happens in mc grievers, trolls and other abominations of the gaming community, yet if it can be played amongst friends it will be just the greatest game ever made.\n","August 16, 2015","true","24.6"," 25 of 30 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","25","30","0","0"

I generally stay away from them, apart from a few exceptions, and Eden Star is one of them. It caught my eye as a survival game with more of a base-building/tower defence focus, in which you gather resources and build your base and defences during the day, and defend it during the night.\n\nYou start off with an Eden Kit and some resources, and you have until night to find a decent spot for your base. The base-building is quite versatile, and as long as you have the resources, you can create the base that you want to properly defend your Eden Kit.\n\nThe Eden Kit is what protects you from this planet's toxic night air. If you go outside it's protective shield (which can be upgraded to increase it's radius) at night time, you start taking damage, and will eventually die. This makes defending it a top priority, and since the creatures that inhabit this world have taken a personal offence to your giant shield, defend it you must, as they will attack in swarms at night.\n\nThis of course means combat, and it starts off as fairly standard, with a variety of guns and a melee weapon in case you run out of ammo. However, some upgrades to your MATA tool (essentially it's what allows you to harvest, build, etc), and you can basically become a jedi with an energy sword, and the ability to push and grab enemies and hurl them at whatever you want (this can also be chained, provided you don't hurl them outside grabbing range).\n\nNow, they may be cool to watch and everything, but they're just a gimmick right? Just shooting enemies is surely a lot easier? Well, in short, no. First off, the grab ability (the most useful and fun to watch) is tied in with your MATA tool's harvesting, so you don't have to bother switching to your gun. So depending on what you're pointing the reticle at, you can either harvest or kill. It's more of a convenience thing, but one I like. The second (and more important) benefit is that it saves on inventory space. Ammo for guns takes up inventory slots, so the more ammo you bring along for your trip, the less space you have to carry the resources you need.\n\nThis means the non-gun options actually provide a tangible benefit to using them, since they don't require the ammo that guns do (although the push does require energy, but that is something completely separate and doesn't take up inventory space). And apart from all that, it's hilarious to grab an enemy, smash him into a rock, then fling him up into the sky.\n\nRight now, it is fairly light on content, and as you'd expect of an early access game, there are some bugs, glitches and crashes (although I personally haven't had a single crash), and I can always tell when a horde of enemies is about to attack my base at night, since the framerate dips fairly noticeably.\n\nHowever, I do have to say, the devs are doing a fantastic job with this game. They're passionate and dedicated, and I have no doubt they'll make this game the best they possibly can. They're incredibly transparent, regularly posting updates on what they're working on, and the vast majority of forum posts are answered by them personally. Ultimately, this is what convinced me to buy Eden Star, and if you like the concept and the direction of this game, you should too.","January 10","true","7.8"," 23 of 27 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","23","27","0","2"

I've backed numerous Survival EA games, and this one by far is the best one I've backed so far.\n\nYou're dropped in an escape pod onto an alien planet, where the nights become so toxic they can kill you. The aliens on the planet do not like your being there, and attack you. You have your MATA-Tool on your hand to gather materials and build, but that's the extent of what you have in the beginning.\n\nYou get an Eden Kit, which provides power and a shield to keep you safe at night. The aliens do not like the Eden Kit, and will attack it, becoming more aggressive as time goes on. Collecting materials, you have to craft with them to build your base to keep you and your Eden Kit safe from hostilities. You can craft a multitude of different blocks, turrets with different attributes, and utilities like doors and generators.\n\nYou can also use what you have gathered to upgrade your suit, make weapons (assault rifle, pistol, sniper rifle, submachine gun) and to craft ammo, of which you can make different types.\n\nThere are three biomes, with more planned. They are hand-crafted and well detailed, with different advantages and disadvantages.\n\nThe aliens you encounter will all be different, from little splintermites crawling around like pests to a bird that likes to ♥♥♥♥ you off and steal the materials you're working on gathering.\n\nThey recently introduced multiplayer, which is basic for now, but has a colony system to allow people to group together.\n\nThe game runs on Unreal Engine 4, and the graphics are fantastic compared to other EA titles I've seen in the Survival genre.\n\nThe developers also release consistent blog development updates about the game, what they are working on, what they are fixing, and each individual person working on the game gives a short snippet of what they are currently focused on.\n\nAll in all it's a great game, great concept, great execution, all done by a great and vocal development team.\n\nEdit: I've played the game more than the few hours it says, not sure why it says that.

The developers give frequent updates on the status of their work and share teaser screenshots. The development map is updated often with ideas that players and devs alike want.

It seems like nary a week goes by without a handful more hitting Steam, let alone other platforms. And yet, Eden Star is proof positive that there is still a lot of room for different, novel ideas to take root in a genre becoming increasingly crowded.\n\nIt's highly likely that you've played this kind of game a thousand times before now. Start with nothing. Forage stuff. Build stuff. Survive the night. Forage better stuff. Survive the increasingly difficult nights. And so on. The basic gameplay loop hasn't fundamentally changed from what Minecraft established years ago.\n\nWhere Eden Star differentiates itself is two fold: one, its sci fi skin actually proves to be pretty compelling, as both the bases, defences, and weaponry you have at your disposal genuinely feel rewarding. There's inklings of Mass Effect and Deus Ex here in everything from the weapon design to the way the "magic" feels. The core gameplay here is rock solid.\n\nMore importantly, though, Eden Star differentiates itself by way of its developers. Early access games are hard to get right, and Eden Star is helmed by a crew who is deadset on staying active in the community. The Trello Board is updated frequently, and the communicativeness of their planning and execution makes this one Early Access title you shouldn't be afraid of.\n\nPlus, having just patched in an entire multiplayer mode right before the holidays, it's clear the crew is dedicated to their game.\n\nUltimately, though, both of these differentiating factors wouldn't matter if the game wasn't fun to play, and it is. More content will only help Eden Star become an even better, more widely adopted and successful game than it already is.\n\nHere's to that future success.","December 31, 2015","true","5.9"," 16 of 16 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","16","16","0","0"

But in the night, you should go home and defend. The insects are coming to ♥♥♥♥ your ♥♥♥♥ up.\n\nSo, it's a bit unusual idea, graphics are good and I haven't seen any bugs so far. Also, this game promises coop in some time, so you could play it with a friend of yours. The only downside that I see so far, is that the updates are a little bit slow, but it is understandable, as the it's a small team behind this project. So... To keep it short, it's a good game and it's well worth it's price. I do recommend it.\n\n8/10.","December 12, 2015","true","5.6"," 19 of 22 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","19","22","2","0"

Do not let the slides fool you, this game is tough, mobs of NPCs swarm your camp despite your best efforts and WILL, no matter what, destroy your fortifications. The constructions you make, unlike popular voxel games such as CraftMine and Rattaria, have meaning, as the center holds a delicate object that, if damaged enough, could set you back to square one, looking for a way to survive longer. To put it simply, during the day resource gathering and Base layout are the prelude to night time, where the game really becomes an image I hope these developers can keep.","February 21, 2015","true","16.2"," 21 of 26 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","21","26","0","0"

Some people are giggly wiggly over the fact that you can grab the monsters from afar and toss them around; I feel that overall, combat just isn't satisfying. Your weapons feel like crap; when you hit something, it'd be nice to have some feedback / recoil / monster recoiling / Something! Even the meelee doesn't work so well; half the time, you will automatically target a dead monster instead of the live one right next to it. What irks me even more is that monsters have no loot, in a world full of things to be looted.\n\nIndeed, if combat isn't so great, this type of game often falls back on creativity via building stuff, and exploration. I found however, that I could build everything right away! The resources aren't hard to find, or challenging to get; there's no sense of progression. I can't venture to a more dangerous area to retrieve a rare material to build a cooler turret to defend against a stronger monster. I can't discover more advanced tools or machines for my base, to fill it up with; I can just build a bigger base to fill up with a maximum of 3 types of turrets - and there isn't even an explanation of what differentiates them from one another.\n\nI really wanted to love this game, and was excited to play it, but after an hour, all that's left to do is build more iron foundations and walls, more of the 1 model power generator, more eden kits, more of the same 3 turrets, and watch it all take down more monsters at night. Inevitably, I will fall off another cliff along the way, or die inexplicably outside my front door, and lose all my gathered materials again.\n\nPerhaps in another year the game will be more fleshed out and start to resemble a final product; for now, all that can be done is play around with the mechanics.","March 12","true","1.5"," 17 of 19 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","17","19","0","3"

You start with a little spawning sequence and get told to pick up your first core-node-thingy (sry, forgot the name). After you did so, you can just roam arround and explore the quite interesting, not too big, world and get an idea where to find which resources.\nEnemies aren't a big problem, as long as you don't get too close to their nests. As soon as you place your first core, nearby enemies will try to reach and destroy it. Sadly, i placed mine too far away from any nest, so they didn't really realize it and didn't try to attack. I belive they are much more agressive at night.\nThere is no save/load right now and if you die, you wont respawn, instead the game restarts where it began. (at least it did so for me, while the tutorial says you will respawn at your core... idk, maybe my core got destroyed while i have been dead)\n\n- stuff.... i wont list it all in details, but there are many quite interesting things you can craft and build already. The interface is done very well. Nothing too complicated while still having a good depth of complexity.\n\nSooooo, quite interesing and recommended! Hopefully it wont take too long until there is a save/load feature and some of the other stuff the devs are currently working on (you may have a look at the trello if you are interested)\nExtremly high potential!

Backing this game since it was on Kickstarter, I know this will grow to be an immersive game backed by a knowledgable and driven team.\n\nPros:\n\n- Dedicated team backing the project to completion with timely but commendable updates.\n- Feedback and new features suggested by the community are heard and responded to\n- Beautiful assets and landscapes\n- A new, fresh kind of Sci-Fi feel\n- Come a long way from its roots without fraying the original concept style\n- Can throw enemies to the heavens or have them halt suddenly as they date a wall\n- Weapons are useful, but don't feel as if they need to be depended upon\n- Story and world building potential is significant and flowing in at a controlled and professional pace\n\n+ Lots more but this is quickly becoming a wall of text.\n\nCons:\n\n- No true objectives as of yet other than survive (namely just building all-around game content)\n- Lack of varied enemies\n- My hardware is entirely out of date, so I can't enjoy this game to its fullest extent\n\nIn conclusion, Eden Star is certainly shining as its team engineer, sand and polish this game from the inside out but has the problem every Early Access has - Bugs, unfinished content and constant updates.

It's the risk of early access, I suppose, but still.\n\n- The premise:\nYou're an advanced colonial super ninja type engineer cyborg dude in some sweet-♥♥♥ futuristic battle garments. Your left arm has a powerful piston powered baton spear thing (that would make a mean plot device in some weird Japanese sex game, but I digress) and your right arm has some device that can eat trees and rocks.\nThere's currently no story, but the context more or less lets you know that you crashed landed on a strange environment, from an espace pad. The environment is abundant and has alien fauna and flora. You use the right hand device to deconstruct and "consume" and store elements from those objects. Different objects offer different elements.\n\nThose elements can be used to construct an "Eden Star" which is some sort of colonization kit that is the heart of your base. Around this base, there's a wide array of componets to build with. Basic things like foundation blocks, walls, doors, panels, but also turrets, laser fences, etc. Building anything use a block-like system where you snap-and-click different componenets together.\n\nHere's why I like this game so much: it takes the free-roam, sandbox games and gives you a clear purpose: gather, build and DEFEND. I love sandbox games, but their achilles heel is that they tend to be pointless: you gather, build and... then what?\n\nEden Star on the other hand, offers a very solid narrative in that there's a day-night cycle. During the day, local alien goons are fairly inactive and will only pursue you if you get too close to their hives (ie.: destructable spawn points). During the night, however, they get the alien munchies and somehow have a taste for your Eden Kit. In other words, in a true open-world fashion they will flock to your base in numbers and it's up to you to defend it.\nThis causes you to explore, harvest and build during the day, so you can defend your base at night. At some points, you're really minding the clock so you can manage your time in harvesting, building and defending.\n\nYou, the player, can craft weapons and items that can be equipped, or you can upgrade your gear. For example, the right hand tool that is used to deconstruct the local fauna and flora, can be upgraded to become a gravity type weapon: lock on to a baddy, grab it in a gravity type field and just launch it into space, smash it against and object or my favorite: fling it at another alien. It's oddly satisfying.\n\nThe Eden Kit can also be upgraded with a better shield and offers a few neat little tricks itself.\n\n- Gameplay:\nIt's pretty nice. The mechanics are easy to use, the harvesting, combat and building aspect felt solid and fluid to me. The harvesting is fairly balanced, in that it does NOT get grindy. You do not need to take down an entire forest worth of trees to build a single block. Inventory management is also easy and hassle-free. You can focus on building, crafting, exploring, adventuring and defending. Going through the different categories and building materials can be a tad confusing.\nGame offers a solid single player experience and has added a multiplayer aspect not too long ago. Multiplayer needs some work, griefing is there but it's just not that easy to run up to another player's base and not get torn to shreds. Thus far, the player community has been helpful and non intrusive. Sure, I've been chased around by some random dude who really wanted to fist me with his left-hand-piston-power-spear-baton-♥♥♥♥♥-contraption, but I've also set up bases with random strangers I encountered.\n\n- Graphics:\nNoting extraordinairy, but nothing poor either. Everything feels well executed. Performance is also agreeable, game loads fast. Level design is actually pretty cool. The setting is no planet, but a series of giant, floating rocks. The terrain is diverse. Monsters currently feel a bit silly and stiff. Nothing at all threatening, as you can just bolt out of there with your infinite stamina colonial cyborg ninja. Did I mention you look pretty sweet? You look pretty ♥♥♥♥ing sweet.\n\n- Sound:\nA bit lacking as of yet. Nothing that really garners your attention. Currently, there are no missing sound clips and I suppose the devs are focussing on the core game.\n\n- Stability:\nAlas, this is my biggest gripe with Eden Star: Single player crashes to desktop one too many times. Multiplayer offers dedicated servers that appear and disappear at the blink of an eyes. Especially frustrating if you chanced upon a helpful stranger and were setting up a base... only to be dc'ed and can no longer find the server. I hope the devs take their time to increase this.\nAt the moment, I've stopped playing Eden Star, because there is no point in investing any time in a single or multiplay session, your work is lost all too easily.\n\nA damn shame, because I honestly, believe this game really deserves a lot more credit.\n\n- The devs:\nThese guys are really going for it. If you follow their updates, you cannot dislike them. They're very enthusiastic and they seem to listen to their community. I haven't been all that involved myself, so I might be off. The only thing I do want to say, is that I like seeing information on updates - ACTUAL GAME UPDATES.\nNever thought I'd say this about an indie dev, but these guys overdeliver on information. They share updates on... updates. That are to be released weeks later. It's fun, guys and I dig the spirit, but maybe you should keep those posts on the forum or something.\n\nAnyway, I'll be checking in on those game more often.\n\n- The conclusion:\nBuy it, try it, support the devs, enjoy a refreshing take on open-world sandbox games that offer a DECENT narrative and a goal and if your fancy is tickled by tower defense games, this game is the perfect hybrid.\nBe wary about stability, though. Both single player and multiplayer are NOT crash free.\n\n","December 28, 2015","true","16.7"," 16 of 18 people (89%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","89","16","18","3","0"

I'm really looking forward to them adding more content and enemies. Adding multiplayer is nice and all but there's not much to do in singleplayer, let alone multiplayer.\n\nThe build system/UI in this game is light years ahead of other survival games that I've played. It's really streamlined and non-invasive. Only issue, however, is that you can basically build everything right from the get go. Not much researching needs to be done. Just need to find the materials.\n\nThe combat system, both with guns and the MATA Tool, is great. Looking forward to more weapons and enemies!

From base construction, crafting, to automated defenses and a meaningful day/night cycle. But it doesn't stop there. Wall running parkour, grappling/riding enemies, unique abilities, and they are working on automatons to help you fight entire wars against other player factions.\n\nThe game is pre-alpha, but I would buy it again. The dev team posts updates practically weekly, and provide a level of transparency that is on par with or beyond even the famously open Star Citizen. They speak to us, and they have a personal relationship with the community. Unlike so many big corporations that follow strict PR guidelines, this is a group of people that know their audience, people who have soul, and most of all dedication: this is obviously a project of passion for everyone involved.\n\nThat really does meaning something, because gamers as consumers really care about the brands they play. They do have a more personal relationship with the creators and company than other consumers do. A game isn't like flour: I don't give a ♥♥♥♥ about the flour or who supplies it, so long as it isn't wood pulp and it's reasonably priced. But games are something I may spend hundreds to thousands of hours on. They are something people care about and grow to love. That's why gamers are notoriously fickle: because they're passionate. They want to see a game be everything that it can be, and they see the company and developers as *partners* in that endeavor. But most game companies have not caught on to this, and still treat it like any other customer-business relationship\n\nBut not Flix Interactive. They understand the nature of their relationship with us. To have a game company actually listening and communicating is a breath of fresh air. There is no silence to make you nervous, there are no worries about if you're being heard or what's going on. You know. And they don't just talk to you. They listen. They take player feedback. For instance, players wanted to build huge bases, even cities. This was never planned for or intended. Do you know what they did? They began optimizing the game for accomodate large structures as best as they could. The idea for drones and fighting robots arose from this, and it's why they're developing it; it all came back to the players wanting large settlements, and those settlements needed defenders.\n\nWith all that said, the game is a pre-alpha. Performance is not exceptional, though over the last patch it has improved immensely in my opinion. The movement is janky at times, the UI is kinda buggy now and then, and it has its mechanical problems. But that's how it goes with a pre-alpha.\n\nBut as a cynical consumer, skeptical and disillusioned with a distant game industry stuffed with the same recycled material, this is a game that stands apart. This surely sounds like a contradiction, as the market is being flooded with survival games. Is this a survival game? Yes, absolutely. But it is not confined by that genre: it builds on it with great ideas. This is a game I can love with a dev team I can believe in.\n\nIf you are something of a gaming philanthrophist, then let me say now: if there was ever a game that deserved your money, it is this one. If for whatever reason, you don't want to spend money on it in its current state, that's fair. But be sure to check back every few months. I don't think you'll be disappointed.\n\nIf you want to see the future plans, what is being worked on at present, and what has been added, take a look at the trello board here: https://trello.com/b/dmyocCtO/eden-star-public-board\n\nPlayers can vote on what they'd like to see added next, provide feedback, and provide ideas. The devs are also active on steam, and have a subreddit which at the moment is practically just updates and patch notes.","March 29","true","14.7"," 15 of 20 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","15","20","0","0"

They're obviously super early in developement, and do not yet even have the save/load features in. The graphics are solid, and the mechanics so far are nice. Gameplay is also surprisingly smooth. Although I do not have any performance issues, the game is taxing on the GPU. I would definitely love to see more optimization (again, I know this game is pre-alpha). The combat from what I've experienced is a little quirky, but nothing that can't be fixed. I was not able to experience the gunplay yet, so it may be more fliud and enjoyable than I first assumed. The price tag is where it gets you though. This game has very little content, and yet is charging a whopping $20.00 for it. I don't buy into many early access games, as I'm not a fan, but this one definitely caught my eye, so it better end up matching the price tag, unlike another early access game I regret purchasing... *cough* Interstellar Marines *cough*. This game has so many possibilities and I would love to see it skyrocket into it's final form with backing from the community. On a scale from 1-10 (I'm taking into account that they actually update this game in the future) I would give this a solid 8/10. It's not perfect, but it definitely should stay on your wishlist. If the price dropped a bit (which it won't) it would have been around a 9/10. ALos, I do realize why the pricing is so high this early, for budget reasons and to help for funding, but that's still a lot of money for such little content.

If not for the multiplayer this might have been the most boing game I have everplayed, its a good game but gathering tons of materials gets boring after a while, haveing a freind or two along side you can lead to some of the greatest things you will ever see in a game.\n\nAs this is an early access game I can not fully review it until it is out of this stage so things like server crashing bugs dont impact the review, so lets get to the pros and cons system I used for my last early access review. [Note more will be added if I see the need to add more to this review, so dont take this review as a final judgement, also there are more Cons then Pros because this is an early access game, of course the Cons out weigh the Pros.]\n\nPros-\n-Game is god damn amazing looking.\n\n-The fact you start off with telekenisis is amazing, this is the most fun i'v had throwing crap around in a game.\n\n-There are no rare materials, how easy it is to get materials depends on where you set up shop. If you set up right you can easly get access to every material in the game.\n[there are more pros but im drawing a blank right now so ill update this later]\n\nCons-\n-The games amazing looks can also be a hinderence, also switching to low graphics settings caused my freind to lose frames but on high is frames are average. The ♥♥♥♥?\n\n-The grind for rescorces are real, its easy to get rescorces but it takes forever to get all the materials you need to build large bases, fix said bases, get back items you lost due to cheap deaths. It is because while you can mine quickly the large size of material rocks just drags out mineing to the extreme.\n\n-I said I wouldnt bring up bugs but this is one I have to put out there. You will die at the most random moments, it was day out, I was just running along, I ran by a tree and boom im dead. A tiny ♥♥♥ tree killed me. What. The. Hell.\n\n-The enemys, demending on your luck you and your buddys base will have next to nothing attack your base, or there will be so many enemys that it will lag your game to ONE ♥♥♥♥ING FRAME! But on the upside, lots of enemys means you might see the amazing sight of the crab like monsters migrateing from one side of the map to another ignoring you and your freinds base.\n\n-The sinper rife is imposibe to use, there have been a few times where me and a buddy tried to snipe at some people who where trying to raid out base but even when we shot at them and they were moveing in a strait line and we shot them in the back, it did nothing, ether it did no damage or it gave no indecation that damage was done. So if you have to use a gun to fight dont use the sniper rife its a waste of materials.\n\nThis is all I can put down for now, I will update this as need be, but until then this is my final judgement. Buy this game ONLY if you have friends you can form a colony with and work together, playing alone is a drag and if you run into a violent player chances are hes got some freinds who want to ♥♥♥♥ you up just as bad.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PrimusPalus/recommended/259570/","PrimusPalus","Primus Palus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PrimusPalus/","330 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThis is what I experienced in the game and what my opinions are of it right now with about 2 hours of play (at the time of this review):\n\n\nPro's -\n\nClones - I can compare this game all day long to a bunch of different survival games, sci-fi games, etc. Not only is that not fair to do, it's impossible to find an exact clone. This game has elements from many different games, crammed into one. I'd say this game is more like Rift than anything else in that regard. They found what works, what was unique, and great and compiled it into their game.\n\nGraphics - I'm a graphics ♥♥♥♥♥... I like looking at things on my computer that don't bore me or damage my eyes. But, I also can find ways to disregard graphics with gameplay mechanics. This game solved that problem for me, because it has game mechanics I like, and looks amazing at the same time. This is top tier graphics and I was stuck on a low resolution. I streamed the game, it still looked absolutely amazing where others would look terrible.\n\nAI - I liked the way the AI functioned and responded to you, even if there was only one type. The one creature still managed to do a number of my "base" and was fun to hunt down. I enjoyed grabbing them and slamming them into trees, or better yet... throwing them up into the air and shooting them mid-fall. Like some sadistic skeet shooting. :P\n\nFreebuilding - This reminded me of Rusts style of building, without the whole naked man junk in my face. It's quirky and needs some work, but overall I could sit all day and build a massive base for myself. If only saves worked. :P\n\nPerformance - I have a solid rig and I'm glad this game treated me right. I usually get penalized for having a decent computer where my GPU or CPU is either not used enough, not balanced, or just flat out not compatible. Not only did it work great out of the shoot, it performed perfectly. I had a few instances of lag, but then I was also streaming too. I could see frames dropping on me, but not frequent enough to be a major issue. That's the sign of a good solid foundation of a game.\n\n\nCon's -\n\nSaves - I mention this first so it's out of the way. You can't save. So, everytime to jump in, don't get attached to anything. This is supposed to be fixed and the rumor was in a patch by 02-06-15. We'll see if that happens because that will be HUGE for people.\n\nCrashes - I list this, and not sure why I use the plural sense... because I had only one. I didn't get too far into the game (about 30 or 40 minutes) but because of the saves I lost everything. The crash may have been a collision issue that I'll forward to the devs. But, another hour or so of gaming... and not another crash.\n\nMultiplayer - Or in the case of this, lack thereof. I am a HUGE multiplayer guy and usually pass these games up if they don't have it. I took a gamble on this game and am satisfied with it, but I would be a fool not to mention that this game is IDEAL for multiplayer. The devs say it's a likely future addition... but until then, I'll be disappointed without it.\n\nContent - There's not much to do once you have a huge base and killed most of the creatures nearby. You can't explore and find anything else (besides resources for crafting). No additional AI, lairs, ship crashes, survivors, etc. I think once the base game gets finished more content will be added, but if you're hoping for this right off the bat you will be disappointed.\n\n\nAll in all... worth the price of admission. I'll be playing it when I can and enjoying what the game has to offer in the meantime. Keep up the solid work and I look forward to seeing what you can add.","February 1, 2015","true","2.4"," 14 of 19 people (74%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","74","14","19","0","0"

The crafting is solid. You can build your shelter in many shape or form which looks really good. You can craft things from one of many material which gives different stats (pro and cons for dmg resistance).  Combat in this game is also very good. Although there are only two kinds of enemies(Flying and ground ones) and two kinds of weapon(Pistol And Combat rifle) in this game, but the combat is a blast and pretty solid. You can throw your enemy against trees to make it collapse and collect the tree resources later. Customization is also good. You can craft many upgrades for your armor, such as faster resource collecting and an ability to repair your building. This game also has a clear tutorial and guide for how to play it, so it should be easy for anyone. In conclusion, Eden Star is a very interesting project and fun to be played.

The previous issue I had with multiple eden kits and unbearable fps loss after some time into the playthrough is gone.

Big potential. Fun, engaging, and challenging I recommend it. That said, in its current state it is A) little more than clean functioning fundamentals and B) A base defense game at it's core. It may be one of the most immersive, pretty, and well crafted tower defense games but it is still about hustling to get the materiel you need and craft (and place) the items you need before night falls and all hell breaks loose.\n\nThings to Know:\nThe game is functional, very functional right now.

Don't have much play time only becuase of work but if i didnt have to work it would a lot more. Having the choice of making stuff out of different metals makes it esier to  build up a base.

See the game has little to no optimization yet, but don't this fool you it is still an amazing work in progress. Parkour is fluent and freckin amazballs, you can grab sh*t and throw it at other sh*t, nights are no longer a long boring time where you are wondering if any enemies are gonna come to your party and not forget the chips.\n\nEven though this game has an amazing concept, it has some things to fix for example there are not enough enemy veriety or gun veriety, no amor types to craft, huge frame rate issues, and you need a powerfull computer for the game.\n\nI am still recommending this game because at $21 this game is a jem and if the developers keep in the direction they are headed in, this game will be 4x the worth the price.\n\nEDIT 1: with three to four updates a month this game is living up to its potential but i still fear about the performance (mainly frames), Besides that the game is definitly worth $21. Keep it up guys\n\nEDIT 2:\nWHATS BAD- The updates are still comming along well but with no improvement on optimization, gameplay, or variety. The game still requires a strong pc, there is no armour craftables, one gun craftable, a bunch of augments (that were here since the start), and no melee weaons other than the one you start with.\n\nWHATS GOOD- With each update there are new enemy types and new bioms to explore. bugs are being worked on, helping people who have problems with crashing and other technical issues. Multiplayer is finally here, i haven't got to play it but its finally here! Still recommending the game as long as the price doesn't change.","June 22, 2015","true","10.6"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","11","14","0","0"

The whole thing revolves around a basic tower defense principal, where you build and protect your Eden Kit from hostile native species, because you're the invading alien and they don't like you. Beyond the possibility of some shoehorned social-political commentary or some such, this game is actually pretty good.\n\nThe combat system is responsive and fun and you have to pay attention to pretty much every enemy so you don’t get pinned into a corner. The parkour system helps with this, allowing you to do a bit of guerilla warfare by running up with your Gauss Cannon, hitting a hive for a few seconds, before running back off into the trees and away from the hordes of enemies. You can and will augment your personal arsenal of firearms and energy weapons with turrets placed around your base to keep away the night time raids. The turrets are fairly basic, as there’s currently only 3 types, missile, auto (machine gun), and laser. You also have to manage power levels in your base, each turret takes some power, and each generator adds some power to the pool. I’m not terribly far in this game yet, so I’m not sure if there’s a practical limit on turrets.\n\nA big part of this game is the building system. As far as I know, your structures won’t collapse in Red factions style if you build them poorly (I hope that gets added in at some point) but if you’re not careful, you’ll eventually get a message telling you that you cannot place XYZ at that location because your structure is weak. This can get a bit annoying when trying to build a bridge, but I appreciate the realism. In order to build structures, you’ll need to strap on your big boy pants and venture out into the wilderness to collect resources. Each structure, as far as I know, can be built out of different base materials, depending on what you have or what you need. For example, an Ironite base is the strongest, but Ironite can be a bit annoying to come by, especially early in game if you don’t know where to look. So, instead of Ironite, you can build with Bridgmanite (no idea if I spelled that right) and take a slight dip in health to stock up on Ironite. Or, you may have a small Ironite structure protecting your Eden Kit, with a larger Bridgmenite fortification. Most weapons and modules can also be built from 2 or 3 base materials, which allows you to ration supplies more effectively.\n\nStorage is a big problem in this game. If there’s a storage container that isn’t your Eden Kit, I haven’t found it. The Eden Kit has 5 material storage slots, and each of those can hold a stack of 300 of one material. This is fine at first, until you’re going out and coming back with your inventory full, because you didn’t use all your bullets the previous night. Your character has an inventory of 10 slots, each able to hold a max of 300 of one raw material, much like the Eden Kit, the place where this gets a bit iffy, is that ammo only stacks to a certain amount, I think around 144 per slot (which sounds like a lot until you get mobbed by 20 enemies and you begin to fire wildly into the crowd).\n\nThe last thing I want to say is just little things I like about the game. The physics in this game are amazing. Pretty much any material node can be deconstructed into physics particles (except for large boulders, which just fuzz out of existence if you try to cut them into smaller pieces). As you mine, collectable materials will spawn and then despawn as you absorb them. PSA though, don’t stand on top of what you’re mining, because there’s a rare chance that the game will flip its ♥♥♥♥ with the physics objects and launch you into the air. The environments, are beautiful, with each biome having different resource nodes that give you different materials. As far as I know, and I haven’t done any extensive exploration, the basic biomes are: Desert, Forest, and Swamp, with a nice blending where they border each other. Each biome will have its own sort of special resource nodes that will give you a specific material, so you’ll eventually need to branch out and explore to get a decent stockpile.\n\nSo yeah, this game is pretty good so far, pretty solid gunplay, a decent parkour system, and it seems to have a lot of polish for an early access game. There isn’t a lot of depth to it yet, but I think I can see where they’ve left room to add that later, with time and more updates.","January 24","true","7.7"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

What I mean is daytime/nightime are quite different. You will be scared at nightfall if you didn't make good use of your daytime. ♥♥♥♥ is like stormship troopers and you will be ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ your pants. Which I personal like that steep progressive learning curve. Each time you play a new game you're trying to see how many days you can make it this time with a new base design.\n\nPros:\n\n-Great alpha game it feels very complete. No annoying bugs that I found. The dev's clearly want you to experience this game one complete package at a time.\n\n-Weapons feel important. You have to decide do I want to carry more minerals for building or should I carry more ammo so I can kill more nests so they don't swamp my base at night. The energy sword upgrade IS AMAZING. love it. I would totally go for a pole arm of this.\n\n-Easy understanding on where stuff comes from and where its located. Could use minor imporvements but for noobs its simple enough to understand and just have at it and you're going.\n\nCons:\n\n-Could use more content. I know its alpha, which gets me excited for new kinds of aliens. I would like to see aliens get special abilities or look different signifying that they are harder than the noob enemies you faught a few days before. New structures would also be welcome, more guns, JUST GIVE US MORE! pretty much\n\n-Combat feels a little clunky. It feels like Halo 1 and I'm looking for more of a Halo 2 kind of feel. I would suggest giving the player specialized weapons for killing hives. Like explosives or a FLAMETHROWER! YES WHERE'S MY FLAMER?! But combat is expected to only get better.\n\nOther thoughts and improvements for the devs:\n\n-Perhaps a more intuitive tutorial for what to do after you get your eden kit deployed. Make a mission about building some turrets on some towers or something. And you must include some sort of "Hey this is daytime, you're suppose to be collecting ♥♥♥♥ and you better kill this damn hive over here or you will be butt ♥♥♥♥♥ come night time"\n\n-I would like to some more storage space with the eden kit. Currently 5 stacks max is just not enough. I would like to see some more armor options for more carry space inventory on the player wise.\n\n-A module that is a medic kit for you to heal your allies. Something like the healing gun from Dust514 would look awesome all sci fi and ♥♥♥♥.\n\n-Shotgun and flamethrower are a must. Consider grenades as well or C4 for blowing up nests. Maybe a freeze or foam gun to just freeze the monsters for like 10 seconds so I can stop running around the damn nests like a chicken with its head cut off avoiding the monsters. The kenetic module is awesome, an upgrade to make it a pulse wave that pushes all the monsters back and knocks em on their ♥♥♥ would be awesome for team play.\n\n-With the current inventory system for the player, you pretty much just choose 1 ammo type. So it makes 2 weapon slots useless. Consider infinite ammo for pistol? Or perhaps another kind of carrying system for just ammo. Like you're bandolier is seperate from mineral pouch and can only hold 5 stacks of ammo choose wisely. Or 2 different bandoliers for each weapon. BUT link it with total weight  so you can't just go crazy.\n\n-Come up with a resource dump. After a while i'm sitting on hundreds upon hundreds of fiber and brigdimite with nothing to do with it. I would love to see a utility structure that is a refinery. Convery fiber into something else. like 100 fiber -> 10 cerelium or something. That way plant harvesting doesn't feel handicapping after a while. FIBER BULLETS?! Or something like that! Fiber to make some kevlar armor.\n\n-Add visuals to the eden kit itself to show that each level you upgrade has signifigance. Like actually show the EK itself changing and becoming more technologically advanced after each level you upgrade.\n\n-Walls that keep enemies out, but turrets can shoot through. Could be the energy walls yes, but I feel like the monsters just go for the pillar part and makes this structure just bait. If energy walls were real and effective it would be better. Or some sort of structure that the montsters could pass through but would Snare them, trap them, slow em, burn em, something. Maybe just modify the laser walls.\n\n-After a while it becomes repetative and you can't explore the rest of the map because you can only go so far from your base and you must return to it. Setting up a new one is too straneous and not effictive later in the game. So. Perhaps come up with some way the base can defend itself and when you create a new base with a new eden kit, a bubble that is impenetrable for the first night or two to give the player a head start. This would allow me to move south and explore other Biomes which I really want to do. Perhaps make this kit a template of a base with 2 turrets instead of invulnerability. That would work great. Or hey crazy idea, make a radiation suit upgrade so we can just go balls to the wall at night time and run for our lives on a suicide mission trying to setup a base.\n\n-Grappling hook made of fiber and some ironite? Do something with fiber it needs more love. I know its hard to do in a high tech game, but everything feels like mineral based and rocks are in higher demand than fiber. Maybe it can be used in explosives? Like back to the foam gun idea, some sort of high tech fiber that binds the enemies.\n\nGreat job though I love the game its the best survival game I've played yet and beautiful UE4. These are the dev's that deserve support and you're money. I only hope that as the game goes on it does not become like DayZ where the devs are happy with the money they already got. Just keep working on it, keep the updates complete, and you will be a glorious dev and have my money.\n\nHighly recommend to anyone :)","December 25, 2015","true","18.8"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

Especially with the eden kit thing, you can only gather and destroy for 20 minutes and then protect at night.

The building was simple, but the inventory was a little hard to get used to but when you get used to it, it's awesome. I played with a friend first and It was really funny and scary sometimes, we laughed and got scared really many times, but It was super fun, and the bad thing Is that, sometimes it gets really hard to defend you base if you dont have sentrys or weapons, so I think it's best to play with friends so you can build up your base quicker and gader materials and craft stuff, then it get a little easier. BUT this game is just wonderful and amazing and I really recommend this game for you to buy it!!\n\n10/10\n\nAnd dont forget that this game is in early access and maybe even alpha I think... so all the stuff are not in the game yet, but I think this game is gonna have an AMAZING future and it is gonna be a lot of fun.\n\nthanks for reading this!!","March 4","true","4.7"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","10","14","0","0"

Still, it's a pretty solid start to a really cool take to the whole construction-survival-sim.\n\nCore to the coolness of this game is how you are wearing a suit that lets you break down trees and rocks in a realistic fashion, they pop and break as you work, the power of a micro singularity at your fingertips, so you can scoop the matter up in some sort of matter digitizer and take it back to your Eden platform in order to build construction blocks, turrets, and weapons.  This suit can also be upgraded to become a full on grav gun, picking up and throwing enemies and other objects, as well as a rail gun upgrade.  It's a great platform to play with 3D engine physics, although it keeps everything above ground (no digging) and it's mostly just rocks and trees and aliens right now.\n\nMaking progess involves upgrading your Eden platform by converting resources into energy but, the more energy your Eden platform has, the more attention of the hostile wildlife it attracts.  As there is nothing to do but upgrade your Eden platform, in theory, things will slowly but steadily ramp up from being a leisurely walk to a desperate fight to hold your ground.  In action, it's very barebones right now, the attacking wildlife comes in slowly, sometimes not at all and, just when things are starting to get interesting, the game crashes or locks up (your mileage may vary; my system might be less compatible than yours).  Lacking a means to save the game, I am sent back to the beginning.\n\nBut it is certainly a pretty interesting tech demo for as long as it lasts, and I hope the developers see through their vision instead of losing motivation, pocketing the early access money and running as some do.","February 3, 2015","true","8.3"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Construction is a point i started exploring.\nThe following needs some attention:\n1.  Since the last patch i cant grab and  hold creatures anymore.\n2. Building from two sides over a crevace is nearly impossible to join the two platforms. Look at maybe making the snap options more grid tied to enable joining of platforms easier. Due to this issue enemies spawn at night at the oposite side then cant get accross making them easy targets and unfair.\n3. Rotating corners of platforms and floor panels is not possible so you cant finnish off your structure corners if the auto rotate/snap doesnt enable the angle you seek.\n\n","December 24, 2015","true","110.8"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","2"

And I'm not exactly sure doing this at 6 in the morning, with no sleep at all, is the brightest of choices, but here I go.\n\nWhat's a good way of describing Eden Star? Well... It's good. Like, really good. How it works is much different than any others like it. In fact, it confused me at first... Instead of knowing about wall running, and taking that first path towards the Eden kit, I went a long way around, and leaped off a cliff to get to it. Can something like minecraft, or the countless other Survival games do that? Maybe. But it more than likely won't make you seem like such a bad-a** while doing so.\n\nAside from that, there's no terrain deformation. All there is, is the ability to cut down trees, dig into various above-surface ore deposits (Which regenerate over time... Somehting that could be seen as unnerving), and go at the various "Hives" around the game area, in order to get the lovely rare as all hell resource that you use to respawn, upgrade equipment, and so on.\n\nWhere am I going with this? Not exactly sure, but I'm guessing that I'm doing pretty good so far. Anyways, the combat system is very unique... It's rare for a game to go "Here. Have fun." and give you access to an item that lets you throw things around like rag dolls. Sure, the targeting is a bit off... Making it hard to actually hit things that are close to you... But it's a fun and unique part of the game that adds that much more charm to it all.\n\nAnd on the topic of charm... The design of the map is beautiful. And with the ability to run up and along walls for short distances makes it that much better. I can't tell you how long I spent climbing a single mountain, to "save some time", while exploring. Spoiler warning: It didn't. And I was attacked about halfway up. Without a gun. Fun, right?\n\nBut yeah, I haven't played the game lately, as... Even with all its charm, I have to admit, it can get a bit old after a while, in the stage it was at. But I would play this game over any other, any day of the week. Because really, it's fun, and I enjoy how different it is compared to other games. Sure, there are people out there who could play "Call of duty advanced Z nuke strike" and call it innovative in its rinse-wash-repeat design, and good on them. They found a game they like. But I'm thinking that they wouldn't enjoy this game too much... It'll just be too complicated for them. But yeah, you may like this game, or you may not. This is just my opinion on it, and if you don't like it, leave.","November 22, 2015","true","67.8"," 12 of 19 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","12","19","0","0"

Eventually they started coming in huge swarms outta no where and the turrets held them off pretty well and my base was pretty well armored. Then I right clicked while looking at one and noticed the flinging stuff wasnt just for the trailer. You can literally pick up one and throw it around and do whatever you want. Throw it sky high then slam it down into a crowd of enemies, grab one and slam it into another and watch them explode, or just grab one and slam it into trees and rocks until its dead. 11/10 slamming bugs all night.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bigjessop/recommended/259570/","bigjessop","du = Tds - Pdv","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bigjessop/","91 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nSo to start of. For a pre-alpha game it's very impressive.\n\nConcept: The concept is very interesting. At times feels like a fps\nwith some satisfying weapons (currently pistol, SMG, Rifle, Sniper, Baton, Energy Baton)\nand then feels like a 3D mine craft.\nThe build system is very similar to fallout 4 in terms of snapping objects etc..\nbut atm, as it is pre-alpha, doesnt have content (basic structural components, 3 types of turret and a few utilities, power gen etc..)\n\n\nFPS: FPS wise it's pretty solid having been built with Unreal Engine 4.\nWeapons have satisfying models and sounds and the enemies are varied enough to\nrequire different tactics not just spamming rifle. You can also upgrade you\nmining tool to project kinetic blasts for knock back and through upgrades\nadd furhter knock-back, damage, projected laser etc.. to make combat much\nmore varied. Feels sort of like a fantasy RPS with both guns and magicks.\n\nEnemies: There are a select few differnt types of enemies that spawn at certain sites,\ndestroying the hive while enemies attack is challanging and rewarding (rare ore telirium?)\nOn a night they attack your base and if you don't take care of the hive the attacks\nbecome worse, sustaining damage to walls,defenses and your EDEN kit.\n\n\nMovement: I really like the parkour in this game. Very satisfying to be acble to scale rock faces with\nthe ability to actually reach ledges significatly higher than you.\n\nMining: Mining is cool. Holding the right mouse strips ore deposits and\ntrees with a nice context menu telling u the compisition of different minearls.\nTHe mining can also be upgraded to either be faster, reach futher or enhance combat by paralysing enemies and\nthen throwing them etc..\n\nGraphics: Very nice graphics as expected form unreal engine 4. Lighting is a bit\nodd for me (could just be me) but the light and dark areas can be too high contrast at times.\nHowever as pre-alpha this isn't something I would hold against the DEVS.\n\nMulitplayer: Not done multiplayer yet but the devs have some pretty good looking guides for\nsetting up a server.\n\nUpgrading and construction: The upgrades and construction require certain minerals/ores\nas a base cost and some allow you to choose the aditional ore/mineral. This allows\nyou to play stategically in what ores/minerals you have to spare etc..\nbasic structures like walls etc. can be made using a select few, some way more common than others\nbut the rarer minerals/ores add bonuses / debuffs to HP heat resistance etc... which is a nice\ntouch. Equipment wise upgrades for your mining tool, kinetic force, repair tools requires both specific minerals/ores\nand additional. Ammo is made at the Eden Kit so you have to work for your ammo, again a nice touch.\n\nDevelopment: The devs seem very pasionate about this game and what they've promised\nto include looks like this game could become very popular.\n\nFuture prospects: Once more content is added, simple structures, utilties, defenses etc and more upgrades\nI think this game could be a real hit. I can forsee large multiplayer servers with factions etc..\nin a PVE environment. Differnt builds such as Heavy hitters, expert miners, expert navigators etc, crowd controllers..\nBosses should be an interesting feature in terms of reward etc..\n\nHere are some of the features in dev at the time of this review:\n\n16km island, should be very interesting\nBoss like enemies\nExplosive weapons - will like to see how much the ammo drains ur resources\nMore buildables\nCreature creation - should be fun\nVehicles - Yes please!\n\nand some features planned:\n\nmore melee - would be cool to see upgrades\nupgradeable armour - very nice, shield upgrades? regen, damage etc...\nMore utilities - not just power generators\ncaves - would be awesome builing in a cave with a heavly fortified front\nrobotic allies - customisable would be awesome\n\nMy thoughts: Been a space age open world builder, I would like to see some advance structures and\nthe ability to change fine details etc.. no doubt someone will try and build a death star. Things like teleport stations so u can set up microbases in distant locations.\nJump pads to cross chasms, surveying tools, maybe bots that go out to survey where good\nsources of minerals are.\n\nStorage boxes are needed.\n\nMore upgrade trees that allow characters to focus on one aspect. such as enhancing the fps elemnt,\nenhancing the "magic" elements, enhancing the melee elements. This could make boss battles\nsimilar to MMOs where each class can have a differnt input that complents others.\n\nArmour upgrades trees that can favor sotrage, defense, speed, parkour etc..\n\nLarge muliplayer servers not just private ones (64 player+ ?)\n\nMore trees etc...\n\nGame music etc..\n\nMore minerals/ore types.\n\nAlso with a game like this you need some way of keeping people interested. If I build everything why do I keep playing?\nBy defeating bosses can I get new upgrades? Super rare ores to allow new upgrades?\n\nPrehaps require minerals/ores for a power source. Have a constant drain on the bae to encourage\nstocking more / upgrading eficieny.\n\nOverall I feel this game has real potential, based on what is already in this build.\nBy buying pre-alpha you put money into something and the reward could be huge.\n\n\np.s. wrote this article in a notepad editor and my spell check was giving me jip.

It has it's perks, challenges, and unique art/style. This game has an enormous amount of potential for future version releases. More enemies, weapons, possibly multiplayer, and vehicles is an example of this potential.\n\nThe only thing that this game lacks is purpose or a goal so to speak. Survival in modern day games is a common goal and common sense which is no longer unique as a challenge when stranded in unchartered territory.\n\nOnce you figure out how everything works, the building system and the RMD modules, it gets very boring. After a handful of hours playing the Hardcore mode you have already built the rifle and pistol, a small base with defenses and a couple of maxed out eden kits, and have upgraded just about everything.\n\nAfter this point you've essentially reached the "end". The only thing to do at that point is to build a bigger base, which is great and all but when you realize that any other rooms other than the ones for the Eden Kits are useless, building a castle seems less interesting.\n\nOverall, I would recommend this game, it is something that unexpectedly caught my attention for a week or so of casual gameplay. I hope to see more new features and additions to this game in the near future!","July 26, 2015","true","10.5"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Like Don't Starve, you take advantage of the day cycle to mine, scrounge, explore for resources, and build and adventure.  While at night, you defend your expanding base in a hostile environment that is also toxic at night, being a key component to the survival element.\n\nThere is quite a ways to go with the content (redundancy of game-play and lack of wiki-game play development) , but having passed on other survival games, I have read, watched and feel this one is something special; at least can be more-so as necessary content is added.\n\nAgain, my biggest con, which is understandable is content needs to be pushed into the game so it has more to offer than just repetitive building and base improving, such as more to explore, travel and value in defeating mobs.  For example, I just logged because of lack of wiki content while looking for material information that provides info on game-play content & mechanics was just irritating me too much.","December 26, 2015","true","7.1"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

I assume the devs will fix this as soon as possible, but this does hinder gameplay quite a bit.  simple bugs like resources going beneath the ground (unable to gather them) is quite annoying but not hindering.

I really like that you start out with a melee weapon, in other games such as: subnautica, minecraft, etc you don't start out with a weapon, that makes it a lot harder to survive the first night.\n4. I like the challenge it gives you when a nest spawns next to your house, a splinter destroys a part of your home, etc.\n5. VERY good devs, they are constantly working on games, have never abandoned a game (To my knowledge), and reply to any forum posts they can find that are asking for help.\n6. A very low violence FPS, well, it's violent i mean it's an FPS, but barely any blood, gore, and things like that.\n7. Multiplayer!!!\n\n-Cons-\n1. It takes a LOT of hard drive space, 10 GIGABYTES!

Mind you this is still in early access, so I can forgive the devs for some of the problems.\n\nThe game features a pre designed world with multiple biomes fill with neutral and aggressive creatures. You need to build a base to survive the night, because during night, the atmosphere turns toxic and you are only protected from the toxicitity by your base. During day time you can gather materials and use it to build floors and walls, defence turrents, generators, or use it to craft upgrades, weapons, and ammo. The world is huge, but generic, which is disappointing, but never the less, still great.\n\nThere are some crucial problems though - motion sickness. For a survival base-building game, it is a killer problem to have motion sickness, and although motion sickness may not apply to everyone, from my experience, it hurts my brain. In a survival base-building game, you expect players to grind and run all around the place for a long duration, and so motion sickness will accumulate and just hurt the player physically, which is just terrible. A suggestion from me will be adjust the audio, and also make sure when gathering materials, the debris don't fly into the camera. Soften the colorful effects for material gathering, the bright color flashing around hurts the eye.\n\nPros:\n-Great survival building game, challenging, but not too punishing\n-Like Minecraft, has great potential in the building aspect\n-More combat than Minecraft\n-Turrets :)\n-Still just Early Access, and already amazing\n-Decent graphics\n\nCons:\n-Minor bugs\n-Generic environment\n-Motion sickness (for me at least)\n-Expensive?\n-Would be better to have materials scattered after death, rather than have the player lose all their materials. The Minecraft approach would be nice here\n\nOverall:\nGive it a go if you have the bucks, keep an eye on this bad ♥♥♥ though, can be the next big thing :)","December 22, 2015","true","6.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The only two problems I have with this game is that there's not a whole lot to build.  Once you build the armory box and generators there's not too much more to build except defense.  The second issue I have is that the game is very repetitive.  Once you get your base built and up and running everyday in the game is pretty much the same.

These guys really have some great potential to create an amazing game. And it already is amazing, i cant wait to see how it continues to develop. I love the gathering and crafting. the combat is smooth and the building is great. All that really need to happen is fill in all the gaps, add more bugs, weapons, materials, buildings, and make a story. All you know is that you walk out of a pod on a strange planet, it would be cool to have a story behind it and a motive to survive. There does need to be more variaty in the bugs (only one so far). mabye some that fly or are super strong. there could be "brude mothers" that guard a large hive that spawns bugs. So much could happen that could make this game above and beyond. Again after playing it i am very excited to see where this game goes. But if there are going to be more bugs there has to be a REPAIR feature. That is a must. Also, whenever i build my base near a mountain the bugs spawn on top and just rain down explosives and I cant do a thing about it cause I cant climb up there nor can I see them. So that could use some work. A radar that shows where the bugs are would be very helpfull. Even if you only have the radar when in proximity to your base. Im also having some issues with sound. The only sound I get is when I hurl bugs around, which is my favorite part. There is just something about throwing bugs everywhere that is very satisfying. But other than that its a silent game. That might just be my issue but I thought id mention it. The amount of time between night and day could be lengthened or the ability to upgrade how fast you collect resources. I feel that I dont have enough time to get the resources I need in the time that is provided.\n\nWell all in all I would recomend this game to anyone looking for a solid survival gathering building game. If your on the fence just get it, its worth it. I could see this game going for 30$+ as it is so get it while its cheap. Good job Devs, I'll be looking forward to the future updates.","March 11, 2015","true","12.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","2"

Even the tool you use to mine, craft, build or fight reminded me of an 'omni-tool', as do the weapons.  Survival games are so frequently based around the sword and board ages or... gah... zombies, this game presented a much welcomed alternative to those flavors.\n\nThe game looks beautiful and the mechanics seem well polished and in fairly good working order, particularly when you take the development point of the game into account.\n\n\nTHE DOWNSIDE:\n\nThere are two major problems with the game right now and both are likely to change as development continues... i hope.\n\nThe first as i see it, the game is extremely shallow.  While everything you can do works well and looks pretty good, you can do just about all of it within a few hours of play.  You can always make your base larger and more elaborate and you can always farm for more materials, but beyond that survival is never really an issue after the first few turrets are placed down.  That isn't to say there isn't something enjoyable about building elaborate structures and seeing just how difficult you can make it for another player to get into your base, but right now you are pretty limited by type/number of things you can build.\n\nThe second major flaw in the system right now, and really i can't stress this enough, the server system is an exercise in pure frustration.  As it stands right now, you join a server and maybe you even took the time to visit the forums and find out which servers are "most reliable".  Even among these your doing well if your server is up more than two or three days in a row without disappearing for that at least that long.  You can switch servers of course and restart your base again... and then you can do it again when this server vanishes... and again... and honestly if you do it again you kind of deserve what you get.\n\nLargely for this reason multiplayer is a pretty lonely existence.  Rarely more than 2-3 people are ever on the supposedly "most reliable" servers.  And its fairly easy to understand why.\n\nOne confusing mechanic was that while all servers are listed as PVE, they are most certainly not.  By accident my friends and I had found our way into another base and were shocked to find we were able to access their resources.  We actually were somewhat pleased at this revelation because while i'm not sure its intended it meant the game had radically new meaning.  We had to rebuild our base to defend against players!  And we were going to gear up and venture out and see what other bases we could crack.  This was quite a lot of fun, but then enter the extreme unreliability of the servers, to say nothing of the general confusion as to the PVE/PVP status of those servers.\n\n\nTHE LOWDOWN:  6.0/10  *with a lot of potential\n\nFor someone who doesn't usually look twice at survival games this one really caught my attention.  It has a lot going for it and i really hope the development process continues along the very promising lines it seems to be.  If your truly are looking for a single player survival experiences (WHY?) then a lot of the issues i have with the game really don't impact you, however, if your looking for a multiplayer experience or to play with friends, the game right now is just not ready.  Its one i will most certainly be keeping an eye on and very hopeful that i'll feel i can rightly flip this review.","April 5","false","51.5"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","9","15","0","0"

Now This Does Not Mean its A Bad Game But it Does Mean I Did Not Recieve The Game I Thought I Was Buying. Here Are My Cons And Pros Of This Game.\n\nCons:\n-The World Is The Same Every TIme. Thats RIght There Is No Randomly Generated Or Select A Premade World, Its The Exact Same Thing Everytime. It Gets Boring Ater 3 Times of Play or So.\n\n-The World Is Not Big. It Will Take About 10-20 Minutes To Explore The Entire World In This Game. 10 Minutes If You Run Fastly Around And 20 If You Take Everything In And Just Laze Around. Too Me This is The BIGGEST Dissapointment. Because Its The Same Exact World Everytime This Is Just A Major Letdown. Its A Rather Small World And Is Amazingly Annoying That You Can Die By Falling Off The World.\n\n-The Game Decievingly Looks Finished. This game Is FAR From Finished. Its Visuals Are There, Its Main Game Mechanic Is There, But Everything Else Is Not.\n\n-This Game Is Not Worth 20 Dollars. Do Not Buy This Game At All Unless You Want To Support The Game Itself, 15 Would Be The Best price But 20 Just Feelse Like A Lot For A Small World That is The Same Everytime. Of Course This Will be Changed In The Future, But For Now Just Hold Off Until it Lowers, Or Is Expanded.\n\nPros:\n\n-Unique Gameplay. This is An Amazingly Unique Game. Very Fun And Amazing\n\n-VISUALS. OH MY GOD. Where Do i Start?! The Visuals Are AMAZING, When You Destroy The Root Of A Tree And It Falls, Or When You Suck The Rescourses Out Of A Rock, it Looks great! The Pieces Fly At You, And Absorb Into Your Suit! It Looks Amazing! And So Does Climbing And The Enviroment!\n\n-The Wave Defense is Great! I Really Enjoyed It! It Was Very Challenging And Fun! If You Like Wave based Defense Games I Would Totally Purchase this now!\n\nOverall Eden Star Has Good Pros And Bad Cons. But In The End I Would Hold Off Unless You love Wave TowerDefense Games!

October 2015:\n\nStill gonna give my thumbs up for this game, the new additions (more upgrades, a new biome, heavily improved building UI including new buildings, new enemy AI including perception and improved pathing, new foliage system that improves performance and makes forests more dense) make sense and the game still runs way too smooth for an alpha. No major crashes or freezes on my system, in all of my playtime the game crashed around 7 times through all updates. The development process is as transparent as ever (devs uploading designs and plans for basically everything except lore). My experience has been nothing but positive until now.\n\nMultiplayer is soon going to be added too, I am going to further update my review by then.\n\ngame: 8.5/10 (not too much to do, but it's an alpha dammit), graphics 9/10, potential 17/10\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEden Star is an early-access game with a sci-fi setting. It belongs to the genres of sandbox, ego-shooter and has roleplay elements.\n\nSo, first off, this game is in a very early early state and most of the gameplay is not implemented, this review is based on the 0.04 pre-alpha update.\n\nI can only speak positive of this game so far, the stability is frightening for a game in a this early state, I only encountered 4 crashes so far and the FPS are stable (i7, 760gtx), the game runs on Unreal Engine 4. The graphics are really good, feel well composed and the art-style is appealing(imo).\n\nNow let's come to the gameplay aspect: Some upgrades are already in, 3 weapons and basic construction. Most of it feels well implemented, it just seems that the devs know exactly what they want, this is not some project of some unorganized garage-devs(*huh*starforge*huhhuhu*). Shooting is still a bit inaccurate. The cool thing is the power of UE4, resource mining feels really awesome and the world is really immersive. The fighting is based on shooting and using your tools like lifting enemies and samshing them into the ground, all paired with parcours elements and wallrunning.\n\nSo, EDEN STAR has a lot of potential, but we still have to see how it will become but it definitely has better chances of becoming something. The devs are also very responsive and explain why they implement what.","April 20, 2015","true","25.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Figures out I have a way of finding my base, goes out to explore and almost dies. Forgets I have a way to find base, wanders and gets lost, returns to base - night one begins. One enemy... I think this game is to ez pez. Night two, Army of xenos comes and I get rekt.\n\n20/10 epic game, great building system so far and so much potential\n\nUpdated Review 2/28/2016\nNow-  serious part of the review. (MANY MANY run on sentences)\n\nSeeing as, I don't have so many hours in this game - That doesn't make someone bad whatsoever. Eden-Star is that type of game where you arent judged by how good you are in hours put into the game, The game is relativley very easy to pick up, where the hours would only mean how large someones base could possibly be. In four hours, I have achieved most things (Some things i dont like to unlock) - this is not including weapons. This game is very free-to-do on your own basis, as in it has no meta.\n\nI'll break it down with some points on how free you are from many things.\n\nCombat System -\nWith the combat system, in most games that involve survival, you'd have to use a "main" tier of weapon, primarily relying on a gun, or some sort of other system. In Eden-Star, you can obtain the Energy Blade relativley early (Basically a superbuffed version of a wrist baton) ; with the addon of automatic aim for melee, you have the capability of charging air enemies, and in basic, warp jumping and smashing them out of the sky (It's not a one hit kill most of the time). Including, you cant just sweep and expect to kill everything, the melee system is Voxel-Physics based, If i were to hit something they could possibly tumble and slightly damage other enemies around them, the blade slicing from the main enemy into the next one besides it. Not only this, due to the physics/voxel way of the game, you have the capability of shoving things down hills or off cliffs.\n\n(A quick note) RMD Modules -\nLaser hand! Be Iron-man!\nUse the force to litteraly smash explosive cysts onto your enemies, or smash them into walls, other enemies, throw them in the sky, etc! (Some enemies explode on death, though they have a start up timer to that, you can throw corpses away or into other enemies!)\nGauss cannon! Because whatevers in your face is going to die.\n\nWith guns, The different types of weapons you have in Eden-Star have the capability of using any of them as a main weapon, as they are all realistically powerful; though are able to be played for people with different playstyles, riflemen, bullet spazzing-smg players, or snipers.\n\nBuilding -\nSince the world is voxel based, If you play Space Engineers you can get a feel for how it all works. Though with that, you can mesh things together (Like in Medieval Engineers) ; If you play Ark Survival Evolved, you may also get this concept. If you place one foundation, you can place walls on all four sides, then on the outer part of those walls, and below into the floor covering the foundation itself (Sometimes you cant, as it runs into voxels which balances it; though for the most part you have very free basis to add even more armor to foundations with this feature). In short, if that confused you, One foundation can hold 12 walls (Which is very cheap) - leaving bases able to be very cheap to create. The game also has a bit of 'structural integrity', platforms only go so far without having a support beam under them (Which can be covered with eight walls on one platform) - as real physics dictates, if that beam breaks, you can be sure whatever ontop of it will go down with it - sadly you wont get the resources from whatever broke. Turrets are automated and for the stages of this game, GREATLY work. They cover a bit of angles, and don't fire directly into your base, or try to fire if somethings inside, breaking your own stuff. Not only this, Since the game is voxel based, you could have turrets wherever you want, they are not limited to platforms, or foundations. You can have half walls out on the fields as well, not limiting it to just platforms/foundations.\n- The only thing with building is that it can only get a certain extent from your EDEN-Kit (3x3 Square Core you need to protect, loosing this does not end the game) ; This ONLY applies to what i know, solid big mass buildings, you can freely place other foundations/EDEN Kits and whatnot inside/around your EDEN-Kit's bubble (Expandable). Not only this - Buildings, are VERY. VERY. Tough. (Since i use Ironite, very common)","December 23, 2015","true","15.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

I got hooked with sandbox survival game like 7 days to die. in fact, it was my first survival game.\n\nTHE GOOD:\n1. if you like strategy game (tower defense) , survival game and sandbox environment then this game is made just for you. it has the benefit of the three worlds.\n2. the graphics are absolutely beautiful ... stunning graphics .you feel engage with the mundane task of harvesting and it makes it fun to explore.\n\n3. the developers are awesome. they are very very engage with their gamers and the patches being release are in very very good quality.\n\nTHE BAD:\n1. The User interface needs some work. you have press a bunch of buttons and use your mouse scroller to do some crafting. at first you dont mind ... coz your learning BUT after being press in time because of the pending nightfall or after doing it several times... it get really really really annoying really quick.  if your use to the easy crafting of 7 days to die then you will be ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off playing this game coz it ain't easy trust me. it looks "cool" but that's it. the blocks icons are color coded the same way so it's hard to make a distinction from one to the other.\n\n2. You do a lot of walking in game. normally i don't mind exploring if you have something will doing it ...games like skyrim or 7 days to die. In 7 days to die... every block in that game can be harvested so your engage to your environment also you can predict where the resources are. wood = trees, rock = boulders , iron = mining . Eden Star doesn't give you that pattern.\n\n3. bad guys walk like flash ...seriously! they are incredibly fast. hopefully that will change.\n4. Unnecessary complication = crafting is so complicated! two sets of material "Required" and "base" component. you can choose different option for base material and you have to meet the required material.  the UI that display this information is old shool! old School. think of  web page with a table with columns and the submit bottom is a tiny buttons ate the bottom of the screen.\n\n\nmore option doesn't always equate to a good experience.\n"Developers" if you reading this...please simplify your crafting system because gamers will be spending half of their time in this UI.\n\n\nFor the developers:\n\n1. Improve your icon that it make sense or rename the harvested material to make it more familiar with the user. "Ironite"?? seriously? call it "iron", Briganite... call it rock lol.  fider ... call it wood lol. change the icon so it make sense. place the harvested materials in location that make sense.\n\n2. your Crafting UI is really hard to use... this is because you guys made crafting too complicated and it doesn't fit in a simple UI design haha. the gamer will spending more time in the crafting system and makei it easy to use helps them out specially when they have 2mins till nightfall.\n\n\nConclusion:\nthe developers are awesome they are very friendly and they the quality of the patches are top notch. i can see the game being polish in no time. this game is more stable than most pre-alpha game i played.\n\nbut i have to say the UI is too corky, if you can go pass the crafting system then i say go for it buy it.  if your coming from games like 7 days to die ... you might wanna wait a little bit until the simplify the hot mess crafting system.\n","January 7","true","4.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","4"

I believe I've explored most of the island that the game takes place on, there's only 2 types of mobs I've seen so far in my time of play. There is a laser turrest and a missile turret, and in one of their descriptions it says "Meant for taking down larger threats", and seeing as how I've only seen 2 of the mobs and with how open the space is. I'm very curious and afraid to find out what exactly a larger mob will be.\n\nIf you think this game looks nice and sounds nice, and it peeks your interest.

This game is hugely playable as it is, and the fact that the devs keep adding loads of content and general improvments to it on a regular basis makes it a winner in my book. If that was not enough, consider the amount of time that the dev team spends communicating with it's community - incredible is the right word for that. These devs are not sitting in their ivory tower looking down upon us mere mortals. They *are* us, i.e real people, listening to our views and suggestions, and they're using these imputs to fuel further improvements.

The goal is simple, protect your world-saving egg thing until you die, which is inevitable, but you can have fun getting there. There are two major things to worry about in ES, first, the spiney crawler drone things that seem to burst from nowhere at every point in the game and try to do horrible, unholy things to you. The second main thing to worry about is falling, and while there seems to be no apparent fall damage, you do however take a minor, itty-bitty, bite sized fatality from falling off the edge. Oh, did I forget to mention the edge? Yes, yes of course I did, as I so dutifully lacked at mentioning, the setting is also placed in an Avatar like sky dimension. And no, unlike avatar, there is no way to get down to the joyful, barbaric blue-monkey people waiting for you down below. In fact, on the note of down below, there also seems to be NO down below, and absolutely no way to get to this nowhere. So, enjoy 20$ of sky-running and trying not to get molested by small insect-like buggers that are keen on literally coming out of every known terrestrial orifice known to man. All in all, a great game. Impossible, but fun to play. Unless you're me. Then, in your attempt to pull off a sweet parkour jump trick, you literally die before the tutorial even kicks in.\n\nThis was meant to be funny....","May 15, 2015","true","13.3"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","60","6","10","2","12"

Yes this game is still in its fledgling stages at 0.0.4 so it does lack content. But the core of the game is great. At its current build it lacks purpose as the only objective is to defend the base, there arn't many "functional" things you can build yet other that basic shapes, and when you do find the other Eden kits that have landed they dont snap together so building a congealed base is rather difficult but, they got it right, this game when you first turn it on gets it right. The ability to not have to depend on guns or mele for combat is novel and appealing.

The developers noticed right away and were helpful in explaining that with PvE servers my concerns would be resolved.  The developers are actively listening to the community and that speaks volumes about the quality of development.  The game play is quite fun.  This game is a really nice survival game with first person shooting aspects, kind of mixed with tower defence  notions and is worth trying out.  Keep it up devs!\n\nPreviously:\n\nI have played survival games where offline griefing is prominent and this game is setting itself up for that same failure, especially after the new patch where looters can take all your stuff while you're logged offline.  I have over 600+ hrs in ARK, which is a similar concept and when I woke up one day Everything I had spent that entire time building had been destroyed and I logged in dead.

You begin stranded on a alien planet with nothing but your wits and whats known as a "Eden Kit" the eden kit is your spawnpoint and storage point, Protect it at all costs! During the nights aleins come and attack your base. Things start getting hairy during your second night as you pray that your turrets work and you dont run out of pistol ammo. The only thing I feel like that could be improved is the  amount of enemies. The difficulty is fine but I hope that enemies will be spaced out a bit more. If the developers wish the aliens to be hivelike i recommend that they make the base aleins a little weaker as by the third almost everything youve built is destroyed and your cowering behind your half destroyed walls.\n\nOverall a great game and I'm looking forward to further updates","March 1, 2015","true","8.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

There needs to be a way to actually defend your base. By the 3rd night there are too many creeps to actually defend against. if they get too close they just blow up and then you've lost everything you just spent 3 days building and mining for. I had a raised box set upwith 8 turrets. Should be easy to defend, in fact it should defend itself, the creeps would walk up and stand just outside the turret range and then burrow right up next to the turrets and blow up, lost it all in one night. Please fix the turrets or nerf the creeps. i would not recommend until the game is actually playable. Also it would be nice if you could repair your structures, if you put turrets on a cube and then the cube is gone then you lose ALL turrets on that cube. Once the game is playable past night 4 or 5 i would highly recommend.","March 22, 2015","false","18.9"," 14 of 28 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","14","28","0","2"

The graphics are decent enough and the effects look nice. Combat feels right. Traversing the landscape is fast and fun without the worries of many survival games such as eating, stamina, or realistic fall damage.\nThe first thing I noticed that felt incomplete was a general lack of sound. No music, very little movement sound effects, and this crazy glowing thing on your hand that rips trees down and pulls boulders apart makes almost no sound at all. You only only hear the actual target getting shredded.\nSpeaking of the harvesting/collecting, at its core it is fun. You can take out the bottom of a tree and watch it fall in various ways with nice physics and such.\n\nI know this is early access, so missing sounds and the only 2 extremely generic enemies I saw is understandable, but once you get the hang of the build system (took me about 20 minutes) you are just gathering, building a base with very limited options, watching/helping your turrets kill the 2 bad guy types, then rinse and repeat. The difficulty ramps up each night as you improve your base. You can save and try different approaces to getting through a night, and you can respawn if you have a certain ore on your base gained by destroying enemy nests. Die without any ore, game over, reload last save.\n\nI got base built up and had about all the fun there was to have in about 3 hours, and I can't say that fun was real exciting or special.\n\nThis is another early access where I would wait and see whet the devs have in store for it instead of paying too much for a general draft of the game's basics. I do see potential though.","July 13, 2015","false","3.8"," 8 of 16 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","8","16","0","3"

I've only played it for a few minutes but my first impressions leave me a little dissatisfied with some of the design choices. My main gripe is with the performance, which is very poor at high resolutions even with other settings set to low. The performance increases significantly with lower resolutions which I find odd for a modern game. Even when you do run at a high resolution it feels like it's in a lower resolution, like when you're watching a low resolution video and scale it up to full.\n\nThe graphics are pretty good but it feels like your graphics card isn't getting what it's paying for. In truth, the game really feels like what it's supposed to be at this stage; early alpha. A lot of optimization needs to be added to make it playable on low to mid-range machines.\n\nI'm sure I'll enjoy it once a few more months worth of patches make their way in but it's going to be sitting untouched in my library for a while. I just hope it doesn't go the way of so many other early access games and have a bandaid slapped on it for a full release. But I've been watching it for a few months and there's been regular updates so I'm optimistic. At this stage I'm not recommending Eden Star unless you just want to help support the developers while they work on it which is fine.","May 13, 2015","false","1.3"," 10 of 21 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","10","21","0","12"

It was a dissappointment. It is definitely not worth 20 dollars, or even 15. It just doesn't have enough content for it to play out for over an hour, and not get boring. I know it's Pre-Alpha, so eventaully it will be more playable... but not right now.

The controls are great as are the graphics.  But, right now, it doesn't really feel like a game per se.  You have about 6 minutes of daylight to run around and zap trees and rocks, then about 6 minutes of night to zap bugs.  The bugs seem to just warp in under my feet as well.  The daytime doesn't seem to be long enough to really dig into any kind of building or exploring and nighttime is a tower defense mini game.\n\nSome suggestions to what's currently in game (not additional features):\n\nHarvesting trees makes visual sense.  I can see the tree fall and break into pieces.  And they take a comfortable amount of time to do so.  Harvesting rocks is a visual mess and takes far longer.  Perhaps tightening up the visual clues of what's left in a rock to harvest or something to clue me into the progress would be helpful.  Also, since I only have abou 6 solid minutes of daylight, spending 2 of them on a rock is extremely limiting.\n\nThe bug alien critters seem to just pop out of nowhere.  I'm not sure if that's a bug (no pun intended) or that's how they work.  It was odd to be turning around looking for these things and they just pop in under my feet.  Perhaps if they originated from their little dens or mounds and skittered toward me.\n\nThey day/night cycle time is very rushed.  Right now, I feel like the game can't decide if it wants to be a exploration/construction game or a tower defense.  It has aspects of both, but they are hampered.  And one major way is the short time windows.  Let me explore and harvest a little longer and actually have some time to build something and maybe have some kind of build up at night, the pacing and number of bugs attacking increases or comes in waves instead of the static two pop in at a time in exact intervals.\n\n\nOverall, I think the presentation of the game is solid.  The help pop ups are clear and understandable.  The graphics are nice and the art direction has its own identity.  I think there's more foundation in this game than many E.A. games in terms of setting, design, and concept.  It certainly has a long way to go, and I'm excited to follow it as it develops.","January 30, 2015","true","1.3"," 7 of 17 people (41%) found this review helpful","41","7","17","0","0"

Tried trouble shooting and reading tweak recommendations on all of the forums and just can't get it to run higher than 10 frames a second making it pretty darn unplayable. It is in pre-release though and it shows a lot of promise. I love the concept and even the resource gathering\crafting system and mechanics of construction are very cool. It just needs a great deal of optimisation done. I suppose it could be an issue with the Unreal 4 Engine, but everything else using Unreal 4 engine runs beautifully on the same PC.

But if a games developer is going to ask £14.99 for a open world game they had better be delivering the same sort of content that other open world games like ark survival evolved does because this is the same sort of price as ark survival evolved (when its on sale) also when comparing this title to rust , 7 days to die and hurtworld ALL those games have lots more content and filler gameplay wise for the same sort of price being asked or less.\n\nSo as a customer you have to ask the question's\n\nWill this game eventually deliver what it promises ?\n\nWill the devs provide constant updates and will the content roll out be fast or slow ?\n\nWill development continue ? or will this game fizzle out ?\n\nOnly two official North American servers at the moment worldwide ? worrying or not ?\n\nIf you want to roll the dice and chance it that the devs are going to eventually deliver with this game and play in a barren gameworld for a few hours with what is currently in game , which isnt a lot. Then pay your money. I myself would suggest fellow possible purchasers to delay pulling the trigger on this right now and either wait for a hell of a lot of new content / patches to see if this is heading in the right direction or wait for a lower sale price. I personally dont understand why people are being asked to pay premium price for a quarter of a game ? But then i am a old school gamer and i have been burnt to many times by EA to want to roll the dice when i spend my hard earnt cash.\n\nTo conclude good game > but right now realise youre buying into a game / idea\nthat hopefully delivers what its promising.\n\nLook at the other reviewers gameplay played time.

Was getting 30fps so lowered my graphics settings to low (I have a 750 Ti and can run other games on medium-high), got 50-14 fps depending on the location. Combat was pretty awful, kept lagging and was unresponsive when trying to fight. The instructions for combat were very hard to read while enemies were hacking at my legs.\n\n0/10 Threw myself off a cliff in despair, game froze up and crashed on the exit screen.","September 8, 2015","false","0.2"," 2 of 13 people (15%) found this review helpful","15","2","13","0","3"

Just go around collecting some minerals and rarely get attacked. Not much of a challenge. However this game is Early Access and has a great deal of potential. Flix Interactive is clearly working closely with the community to deliver a wonderful game in the not so distant future. As of right now I still do not recommend this game but keep a watchful eye on it as new updates are released.","February 1, 2015","false","0.6"," 18 of 95 people (19%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","19","18","95","7","8"

Most of the mechanics work pretty good and the game is very much playable. I found myself becomming disinterested mostly because the mobs don't spawn fairly (seems around the third night they just come at you faster than you can take them down. Frame rate issues also make this harder), and you can't take down defenses once they are put up; you have to wait for them to be destroyed. I'm sure that will be fixed later. If you really enjoy farming for supplies and stick around to play a game after getting a good idea of what the game is about, then you'll enjoy this. I look forward to coming back in a month and seeing what has changed.\n\nP.S- $20 is a bit heavy for the game at this point. If you have a small gaming budget I would wait a little while and pick up something more complete.","March 7, 2015","true","1.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

So recommended as it is playable to a point even at this early stage.\n\nObviously there's still plenty to get done. Incredibly short day/night cycles annoyed me immensely and i hope this is something that can be adjusted later on. Losing all of my inventory on death was frustrating too. Spending time gathering and then becoming swamped by a nest was down to my own fault as I wasn't paying much attention as to where i was going (lost inv was still annoying regardless).\n\nOverall though I wish I had waited a while longer before buying but I can see this game being one worth buying.","March 30, 2015","true","0.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
