On the surface this looks to be true, but under the hood sits a different beast. Instead we find a survival sim, ala Oregon Trail, with almost no forgiveness in it's computerized soul. There are strategies and ideas that work, but quite often you have to roll the dice and pray.\n\nAt any point, a single wrong decision or unlucky break at the wrong moment can send you screaming back to the begining of a chapter undoing half hour worth of work. The more mercenary you are, the more wiggle room you are given. Kindness may or may not be rewarded, and sometimes will be acts of futility or suicide. Soon it becomes a balance of risk and failure, of cost and rewards. You are forced to buy time more than once at the cost of your own flesh. People will die, and you never know who you really want to save.\n\nThrown into this mix are a set of metarules that neither the player nor the character know about until they are stumbled across. You'll stumble across them at the worst of moments, wasting time you never really have but serve as puzzle pieces to the larger narative.\n\nThat said, the question becomes: is it worth it a playthru?\n\nMy answer is a cautious 'yes' to those who like creative and harsh gameplay or those looking for a different experience.","July 29, 2014","true","10.3"," 788 of 903 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","788","903","0","8"

While I haven't spent a lot of time playing the new modes, all evidence points towards them providing acceptable alternatives which fix some of the issues highlighted below. I will leave my original review intact as the main difficulty hasn't changed any, and will hopefully have additional thoughts up eventually.\n\nOriginal Review\n\nAs I sit here and enter the same commands over and over again, I feel a certain autonomy take over. My mind has numbed to the plight of those whom I hold at the end of my gun. Empathy has long since ejected from the escape pods and crash landed onto a dead, sandy planet nearby. Common sense jettisoned eons ago. I shoot them in non-vital locations, I punch them repeatedly ‘til their faces look like the meat Rocky used to practice with. They beg me not to do anything crazy and I just don’t care. Oceans gush forth from blood stained eyes, the salty water providing no comfort or nourishment to parched souls. My finger is quivering above the trigger, its cold steel the only thing I know anymore. Lost to the hypnotic whir of densely packed computerized science equipment, I drift off in a daze in the midst of the situation. Why do I feel so disconnected from these horrific events? Have I always been this broken or has something made me this way? Why is it that, somewhere in the back of my mind, I feel like I have done this all before?\n\nOh, that’s right. Because I ♥♥♥♥ing have.\n\nGods Will Be Watching has been advertised as a game about choice, moral conundrums, and how far you’ll go for the sake of the mission. This is, unfortunately, not what the game turned out to be. Instead, it may be best to view it as a puzzle game, one in which you need to figure out the optimal pattern for shooting hostages in the leg, hacking the computer, and holding  off the oncoming SWAT team, all while keeping your hostages from losing their minds or getting a little too comfortable instead of fitting tetrominos together for a high score. It had all of the potential to be a memorable, stressfully worthwhile “experience” like Papers, Please. Unfortunately, the execution of its many parts fail to come together in any meaningful way, much like the game’s choices or lack thereof.\n\nDespite flashing choice as though you were at an all-you-can-cry buffet of nerve testing conundrums a la The Walking Dead Season 1, there’s very little in the way of consequence to anything you do. Characters whom you watch violently expire from this godless universe will magically re-appear in the later chapters, which I will cover more later, even going so far as to having their ghost speak to you. Every situation has a set of conditions that must absolutely be met in order to progress or else you will be judged by the gods as unworthy and forced to redo the entire chapter. Failing to keep a specific person alive can doom you towards the end of a segment, mismanaging your various resources could lead to an instant ‘game over’, or the RNGods may decide that on this die roll that revolver will finally go off and plaster the wall with your brains.\n\nThe skill-based deaths and resets I could forgive to a degree, but the fact that die rolls can force you to lose 30 minutes of progress requiring you to do every painstaking move over again to try and progress is mind boggling. Even more so when you realize that there are no mid-chapter saves at all. The only saves that occur take place at the beginning of a chapter, so if you have to quit the game at all you will need to either finish that chapter first or be okay with your work vanishing. To call this a shortcoming is understating how frustrating the entire lack of saves thing really is. Almost every single chapter drags on needlessly and could have easily been cut in half with progress doubled to allow each scenario to only last 10-15 minutes instead of 30-45.\n\nI audibly groaned when the torture sequence teased that it would last longer than 20 days. The desert scenario is almost entirely centered around RNG rolls and luck deciding you were worthy. At least some of the other chapters, such as the hostage scenario in chapter one, tie their mechanics to detailed animations that give you an idea of exactly where you stand with each element of the puzzle. The Russian Roulette segment can, and potentially will, send you back to the beginning of the chapter it appears in. I mean, I watched The Deer Hunter too and I didn’t think it would make for a good idea in a video game! Thematically, it’s cool, but leave it to cutscenes like Killer 7 did.\n\nIt’s a shame too, as the story presented could have made more of an impact if people could actually make it to the final chapters to see everything tie together. Players have been noticing a lot of inconsistencies and oddities, citing the game’s touting of choice as though it would matter and being disappointed that killing off a character in one chapter would leave them alive in the next. The story does, in fact, get around to explaining why this occurs but it happens so late in the game that I worry most players will have given up long before then. I get that the story uses the cycle of repeating the scenarios over and over again but it’s just not that fun. It’s like a Coen Brothers movie that misses its own point.\n\nGods Will Be Watching tested my patience, caused me to do things I wouldn’t have ordinarily considered doing, and made me live out the harsh life of Sgt. Burden, with us both wondering why the Gods insisted on punishing us so. In the end, the developers’ insistence on arbitrary difficulty through randomization under pressing time and resource limits and difficulty spikes really slaughters any momentum that could build up and may leave players feeling unsatisfied. I grew so frustrated by restarts that I ended up caving and playing on easy. Even then, the game was no cake walk. Perhaps the point of the game is to break me down and wear out my ability to give a damn. But somewhere deep within myself and Sgt. Burden, we found the will to continue on. Something driving us forward despite the odds. But not many others will, I fear. And for their sake, I hope the Gods are listening as well.\n\nIf you enjoyed this review, feel free to check it out at http://www.rgz.ca/gaming/gods-will-be-watching-review-nihils-hymn/ along with my other reviews as they come.

You will think all your efforts to get out of the situations, while keeping everything else in one piece, focusing on the well-being of everyone around you are meaningless when that one chamber loaded with a bullet is fired, or when you reach a dead end in a desert, all based solely on chance.\n\nYou'll start off trying your best to advance through the chapters and keep everyone mentally and physically safe, only to find yourself wandering through a desert in the game over screen. You'll start questioning if that's fair, if the devs were just stupid while designing the game, making you fail even after you made all the "right" choices. You will then start to make some harsh choices, sacrificing the mental well-being for the sake of physical safety of the characters. You will then maybe start to make some progress until something random happens (like that one chamber loaded with a bullet is fired) and you're in that desert again, wondering what did you do wrong this time.\n\nYou will start over, now focusing on advancing, you'll start to make some physical sacrifices for the sake of surivival. You'll make a person eat its loved one so that everyone can get away of a situation, or execute people in cold blood just to make sure there's enough oxygen for everyone to breathe. You'll stop caring about the random factor - or your own mistakes, even - that keeps taking you back to that desert. You'll also stop caring about the people around you, it doesn't matter if you'd care, if you're prone to fail anyways.\n\nAnd for that matter, failure is always at your doorstep, it really doesn't matter which choice did you make in the end, as long as that end is met. You will then see why 30% of the user reviews are negative, and all of them are focusing on this "your choices don't matter" as the single, most negative point of the game. I gotta say that's something pretty unfair. You see, the choices you make actually doesn't matter at all, that's the whole point of the game, and this is a good thing, this game would be pretty pointless without it, actually (there's the puzzle mode for that non-random experience, it sucks).\n\nI won't tell you exactly why choices not mattering is the whole point of the game, that would be spoiling. But I'm sure you'll get it by the end of it.\nOr you won't, maybe you'll turn a blind eye to the phylosophycal plot behind this ruthless experience and focus on the ruthless experience itself, just to come here at the store page and whine about RNG, or maybe you just want to have a good time getting frustrated, and are tired of playing something like Dark Souls.\n\nHell, i wouldn't even write this damn review if it wasn't for the "fairness situation" and why it's genius and makes you move away from the PC and take a walk outside to digest what your mind just registered.\n\nIf you just want to enjoy the harsh situations the main character experiences, the game has a mode that turns randomness off called puzzle mode i guess. But i truly advise against it, for which you would automatically lose all the story making sense, and why the game over screen is not actually the game getting over, and that you did not lose any progress at all in your failed attempts.\n\nBut, all in all, in the end, it is all meaningless, your choices in life, just like your choices in-game, are meaningless, out there, there's a guy who didn't write this review, or any review whatsoever, or he (she? it?) did, it does not matter. We were born by chance, and chance surrounds us. Everytime i fail or succeed, be it at an exam, at hitting on girls, or at a video game, i can see it does not have a single piece of importance, the outcome doesn't matter, because i know that the universe is so great that even the most well-thought and overall good choices will lead only to chaos.\n\nWe just gotta continue playing this game of chance, feeling that the universe is mocking us at every step.","June 12, 2015","true","15.2"," 202 of 250 people (81%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","81","202","250","15","20"

I expected to pick it up for a few hours, beat it in a day, and never think much about it after that. I was wrong.\n\nFor one, this game is hard as hell. Even after the mercy update which added additional puzzle and narrative only modes that remove some of the chance, I spent honest to god hours trying to beat some of the chapters. The results were rewarding, don’t get me wrong, but every death sent me back to the beginning and with no checkpoint saving that meant every decision I made had the potential to send me down a different path within the level. There were many times that I would have ditched the damn thing, as I’m not a patient person and honestly, point and clicks rarely interest me. But this one did, because it isn’t really a point and click. It’s more of a resource managing survival simulator with a really killer soundtrack.\n\nYou follow the life of a man named Burden and direct him in seven different levels; a break in, a torture chamber, a laboratory, a desert. In every chapter, lives are in your hands, and there are often few repercussions for deciding to end those lives or choosing to save them. Do you inject a trusting pet with a poison to find a cure to save your whole team? Do you kill a child to get a security code that might save an entire planet? There’s nothing really stopping you from turning Burden into the most callous antihero you can imagine except that at the end of each level you can see how every other player did and what choices they made.\n\nThe game is also incredibly story driven, carefully constructing a gritty universe through simplistic (and gorgeous) pixel graphics and dialogue. The fun part is that while the end in pretty much the same no matter what you do, the small choices you make in early chapters will effect the rest of the game very quietly. I’ve rarely felt so haunted and confused as when I killed a teammate in Gods Will Be Watching, not because what happened was scary but because it didn’t matter.\n\nI’m not going to go too much into that because, spoilers, but if you’re looking for something to lose sleep over for a few days this game will certainly help pass the time. As I type this the game is on sale for $5usd, but it's definitely worth the $20 I paid for the collector's edition.","October 21, 2014","true","41.9"," 138 of 168 people (82%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","82","138","168","2","0"

I think Gods' has been underappreciated and unfairly reviewed simply because it poorly manages our expectations. I want to emphasise that this is a resource management endurance strategy. You don't walk around freely, examine things, pick up or combine items. There's no inventory. There's no traditional adventure game puzzles. Again, it's not an adventure game. It's just not.\n\nMost chapters are just one "room" with a clear objective, and you must manage the people and resources in that scene carefully to survive until the objective is achieved. The interface is minimalist: You don't get direct control of your character. Clicking a person or object in the scene brings up a context menu with a list of choices. Typical choices are conversational, issuing orders or performing an action. The "puzzle" aspect comes from failure. Each chapter, you have to figure out how these actions affect the variables and only then can you develop a strategy to balance and exploit them. Because you can fail before even trying all possible actions, you'll probably fail at least once per chapter.\n\nThe reason I think it's called an adventure game (a classification I strongly reject), besides superficially presenting as one, is it's a highly narrative experience, played out primarily through conversational in-game cutscenes leading into each chapter.\n\nPROS Gods' feels like a fresh and original concept.\nThe story is an epic mind♥♥♥♥, and is the main reason I love this game. It's of time-honoured sci-fi tradition: dark, intense, existential and philosophical. It's a work of art and it makes you think.\nIt has gorgeous pixel graphics with a mysterious ability to convey a lot with a little. There's some nice animation and lighting details which pixel art fans will appreciate. Non-pixel art fans, this may be the game which changes your opinion.\nThe music works well, mostly ambience supporting the tension but occasionally stepping into the foreground for crescendo events. While I don't normally buy soundtracks, I do recommend the Collector's Edition for the 2h22m soundtrack in this one.\nThe gameplay is satisfying when you succeed (frustrating when you don't).\nCONS Marketing fail: it's a 100% strategy game thinly veiled as an adventure game.\nBy jumping all over the place in the first half, it gives the false impression there's not much plot substance. I think the intent was to slowly build mystery and intrigue but I felt it instead failed to capitalise on one of its strongest points from the get-go.\nThe whole premise of moral dilemma, choice and consequence is completely oversold. Choices don't carry between chapters and the gruesome, pixelated deaths of your comrades appeal more as black comedy than weighing on your conscience. Make no mistake: you're now a psychopath and your loved ones are an expendable resource there for exploitation in achieving your goal. You will regret their deaths solely for loss of their usefulness.\nThe easier difficulty modes added in the 'mercy update' were poorly implemented and diminish the entire experience. I implore you to play in 'Original Light' mode, because by eliminating the element of chance, the newer 'Puzzle Light' and 'Story' modes undermine the most engaging aspect of God's gameplay; the factor of risk when making decisions (it should be noted that even in the harder modes, outcomes are still primarily based on odds and not completely random). The new modes not only rob you of a sense of accomplishment, but make the game feel too short (it stands at a respectable 8 hours in Light mode by my clock, though I'm a poor strategist).\nGods' is definitely not for everyone: (a) There's no voice acting. (b) Gods' is minimalist and subtle in every aspect from gameplay to art, sound, animation, storytelling & characters. While this feels like a deliberate stylistic choice, not everyone will see it that way. (c) It's a resource management game and therefore involves many repetitive actions. (d) You are left to figure out the basic mechanics on your own, through failure. Meanwhile, it's only fun if you play on the harder difficulties. Gods' was designed to be cruel.\nHMMMMMM Some of the first PC games I played, around 25 years ago had this magical and mysterious air about them. They seemed so creative and imaginative and just so... out of nowhere. I don't really get that feeling these days, but I got it from Gods Will Be Watching. By chapter 5, I was totally sold, and after completion, I couldn't stop thinking about it for days. That's why I'm proud to have supported this game, and have featured it on my Steam profile ever since.\n\nWhile it's far from perfect and I can completely understand why some people even go so far as to loathe it, to me, Gods' is an absolute treasure and is close to my heart. This has nothing to do with nostalgia and everything to do with artistic merit. There are many better designed games but somehow they're just not as memorable.","August 16, 2015","true","14.4"," 80 of 87 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","80","87","2","5"

There are roughly (I didn't count) 7 difficulty settings. The hardest being.. original. I played the first 3 chapters this way. I failed over and over. So, not really really being super into failing I started over on 'narrative' mode. The “easiest” of them all. Now, it WAS easier, my decisions did not effect the variables as greatly but guess what.. I failed over and over probably 10-30 times each scenario. But each time with new information as to what needed to be prioritized. Believe it or not it all comes together narratively in the end and I want to tell you now; its super satisfying.\n\nThis game is highly narratively driven. It is technically an adventure game but most of the puzzles take place on a single screen. The puzzles are very complicated and unforgiving, not because of pixel hunts or anything you might expect but because each scenario you find yourself in has about 10 or more variables that change with every decision. It is turn based and through discovery you'll find that some actions are free and give a better handle on the situation. Each time you fail you come back with more knowledge of the previous attempt. Do I focus more on keeping people alive or moving forward? Do I focus more on getting the information I need or staying true to my allegiances? Each time you'll find through experimentation what makes what tick and how much it'll take before it pushes back.\n\nI mentioned it was a meter management sim, only, not until later on when things get really sticky do you have concise information about where the meters are or even what your actions will produce as a result. That is, until you find out their consequences first hand. But until that comes you've no idea what position those meters are in or how much your actions do or do not affect them.\n\nEach scenario puts you charge of multiple people or rather one person delegating orders. And to this games credit, every time something bad happens, every time someone dies, despite the very real fact that it may have been another character doing the action possibly due to your inaction. It feels like its your fault, as if you are entirely responsible and had it not been for you indecision or blatant lack of thought during making your decision things could have worked out so much better for everyone.\n\nEach decision due to the fragile nature of things adds that much more meaning to it. I hate to go on and on about how great the ending feels and how it all collides together. But I'm going to, the mounting frustration due to the failure of each puzzle and how rewarding it is to finally overcome such adversity and impossible situations is truly rewarding. Easily one of the most frustratingly beautiful games I've played in recent years.\n\nNot for everyone/10 but truly rewarding for those that do complete it.","November 26, 2015","true","7.7"," 67 of 70 people (96%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","96","67","70","2","2"

I don't always need my decisions to go my way, but it often feels like it doesn't matter -- making it feel like my input doesn't really play any part in the game at all. I might as well flip a coin.\n\nAnother issue I have with the game is that the outcome of one scenario won't affect the next one, so if my partner dies during the very intense torture sequence he'll still be alive and kicking as if nothing happened as the story continues, which takes away any impact from what happened.\n\nI want to love this game. The game jam scenario was incredible and I gladly support the developers. Perhaps a sequel (or a similar game in a totally different setting) might be better, but it's hard for me to recommend this with these issues.","April 16","false","5.2"," 93 of 110 people (85%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","85","93","110","2","2"

But still on the merits of such is it a good game? No, as it is so brutally and (more importantly) unfairly difficult, that it makes Dark Souls look tame.\n\nI can only give you my impressions so far at this point in writing, but after many attempts I have now progressed to the 5th of 7th chapter on easy difficulty, due to the bone crushing nature of the normal mode, and the game suffers from, I feel, 3 key issues:\n\nLack of checkpoints\nLuck based gameplay\nTrial and error situations\n\nIf you fail a chapter at any point, you must restart the whole thing again; and these are not short levels at all, they can be up to 30 mins or more.\nWhat makes this all the more infuriating is the unfair nature of the situations you are thrown in. Some personal highlights of frustration:\n\n-Erratic and unreliable behaviour indicators on hostages, along with dice roll elements for progression in chapter 1\n-Russian roulette in chapter 2, where if the RNG decides you just go back to the start of the level.\n-Trial and error elements are also at play in the same chapter, where the pattern of torture is easy to circumvent if you know in advance what is coming but you'd only know that through hindsight and past failures.\n-Chapter 3 has shifting goalposts - devised a plan around what you were told at the start of the mission? Too bad chump! We've got more work to do! Again, only hindsight would allow you to plan for the "real" goalposts.\n-Chapter 5 is purely luck! Find a hidden base, that is in a randomised location each time!\n\nAnd it's at this point that I just wonder if there is any point in continuing this arduous slog. High difficulty has its appeals, the popularity of Souls series and Roguelikes are proof enough but they at least are fair.\n\nThis is closer to a frustrating dice roll simulator than a survival game.

So basically a game where the makers admit is designed poorly, and forego immersion for the least interesting part of the story.\n\nIt starts on the wrong foot by having the first level be the hardest one, because nothing like a bad first impression.\nOn the second level we are shown their stellar QA, where if your buddy dies he still keeps talking during the scenes.

Basically a point and click (adventure) thriller where choices played a heavy role in the out come of events....\n\nNot quite, I just finished beating a chapter where 3 of my crew members just ran off (damn deserters....) and lo and behold, in the next chapter they magically came back! So yeah.... choices you make don't matter towards the outcome of the game.\n\nOriginally after reading many "Not Recommended reviews" which pretty much summed up my original feelings on the game I really came to conclude why this game is more disappointing in it's game play...\n\nAlthough there is a heavy focus on dying/failing A LOT, there isn't a balance of feeling rewarded after completing a chapter. Many people compare it to Dark Souls, while in Dark Souls and in this you learn from your mistakes, but after you beat an enemy in Dark Souls you feel a sense of accomplishment and victory, while in Gods Will Be Watching there isn't much satisfaction to be found other then a relief of not having to play the chapter over for the 10th time.\n\nSame comparision can be made to Portal, you get that "AHA!" moment where the game makes you feel like a genius when you figure out a puzzle. In Gods Will be Watching it's just trial and error over and over.\n\nTo boil it down here are the choices you make in this game:\nRestart Chapter\nRestart Chapter\nRestart Chapter\nRestart Chapter\nRestart Chapter\nRestart Chapter\nBumble f*** your way into the next chapter: Repeat.\n\nIt's sad that I can't really fully recommend this game, it almost had everything going for it, an amazing sound track, cool pixel graphics, a great atmosphere, and... well to be honest I zoned out of the story a long time after having to replay the chapters, you have a tendency not to give a f*** after seeing dialog repeat so often.\n\nAnyways, if this game still has your curiosity, please at least wait for a sale to give it a go.","July 26, 2014","false","6.8"," 360 of 539 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","360","539","0","6"

I was expecting something akin to Masq, a story that is dynamically affected by the player's actions, allowing you to move forward even when a bad choice is made. The game's description certainly made it feel like that was the game I was buying, but unfortunately the game does not work like that at all.\n\nNo, the six different chapters are simply puzzles, and they must be completed in a very specific manner or else you have to start the chapter over from scratch. There is no way to save your game during a chapter, and if you fail the chapter (and you WILL fail, many times) you will end up losing up to half an hour of play time. This is very frustrating.\n\nDon't get me wrong. I am not criticizing the game's difficulty. I like games that are difficult. I played a lot of FTL: Faster Than Light, for example. But the fact that this game forces you to redo everything when you fail - complete with reading the exact same lines of dialogue over again - does not amount to fun; it is simply repetitive. And yes, the latest updates allow you to tone down the difficulty if you want to, but this simply de-fangs the game.\n\nAnd even when dynamic results DO occur during the chapters, the game seems to forget all about them when the current chapter is finished. For example, when I played the torture sequence, Jack ended up dead, and yet in the next chapter he was alive and well with no explanation given. This left a pretty big question mark in my head.\n\nUnderneath its questionable mechanics, Gods May Be Watching does have a well-written story, charming graphics, and an excellent music score. It attempts to take a fresh approach to the adventure game genre, but unfortunately this approach doesn't always work.\n\nIf you're interested in this title, I would recommend waiting for it to go on sale.","December 16, 2014","false","2.8"," 93 of 126 people (74%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","74","93","126","2","1"

The style is spot on, the premise was interesting, and anything marketed as 'an innovative departure from the traditional point-and-click adventure genre' catches my attention immediately.\n\nHaving now played the game and having watched friends play through the bulk of it, I'm not quite sure if that quote was meant to be some sort of cruel joke or not.  Gods Will be Watching is not an adventure game.  It is a Crisis Management Simulator with a story attached, and retro point-and-click adventure game graphics and art that serve as a GUI for said Crisis Management Simulator.\n\nEach level puts you in one room (Sometimes with one or two other rooms nearby) where you are given six or more things to manage in one turn, and one action that you are allowed to manage with.  In the first level you are put in charge of a hostage situation while your team tries to hack the mainframe of the building you are in.  There are four hostages, each with individual moods to manage, the hacking process itself which needs to be reinforced periodically otherwise you lose progress, and a group of armed guards right outside the room inching their way forward every turn.\n\nWith all these things progressively 'worsening' every turn and only one action per turn to use to address any of the six (or more, as you progress) factors, you are forced to make what the game is marketing as difficult, morally ambiguous decisions.\n\nIt is excruciatingly difficult, and you will never (Or very rarely) get through a level with all of your 'resources' in tact.  The game is designed that way, and you are meant to fail over and over again.  Levels can be anywhere from 45 minutes to an hour and a half long depending on how long you take to make decisions, but the game never moves beyond this basic tenet of creating a situation where you have to juggle eight chainsaws but you only have one hand, and then later you just become blind.\n\nThere's no adventuring anywhere near here, so when they say it's a 'drastic departure from point-and-click adventure' they could've actually said that it was a drastic departure from Microsoft Flight Simulator and that would've been just as true.\n\nMisleading PR aside, what's especially annoying is the nature of this crisis simulator.  Sometimes, (And the game doesn't always tell you when.) it is heavily RNG dependent, meaning that you can lose the game 45 minutes into a mission because you got a bad roll behind the scenes and consequently got shot in the face.  There are no checkpoints in Gods, so you go back to the very beginning of the mission and have to roll the die again, after another 45 minutes.\n\nI don't shy away from difficulty usually.  I love the Souls series because it is punishingly difficult and consequences to failure are dire, but it's never unfair with its difficulty.  Gods is unfair.\n\nThere are other times where you will have made a crucial mistake early on that doesn't outright screw you over, but slowly erodes your chances of winning until the very end of the mission an hour and a half later.  You fail and you restart, having to perfectly balance a host of rapidly changing factors for another hour and a half and hope you didn't screw up at all along the way.\n\nMoral choices in the game thus become non-existent.  You think nothing of morals, and you start to view the game as a set of variables that need to be manipulated in such a way as to guarantee success as things start to erode.  I suppose you could say that the game forces you to be ruthless, but it is too effective.  Instead of worrying about the fate of the characters invovled, you look at them simply as bits in your poorly running machine, and if they take too much oil then you get rid of them.\n\nThe problem is, that's not a moral choice.  It's a mathematical one.  A clinical one.  You don't feel torn when you make these decisions because you care about the characters, you feel torn because you're not sure if this move is going to screw you over an hour later and make you painstakingly redo everything.  I would've gladly sacrificed everyone just to move onto the next mission successfully.\n\nAnd that's the other problem.  Consequence, three quarters of the way into the game, does not exist.  I will avoid spoilers, but suffice it to say that things that happen in one mission don't seem to carry over with any kind of meaning to any subsequent mission.  To use a loose example, if you lose your special hat in one mission, you will magically have it in the next one with no explanation as to how.\n\nDespite all of this, I don't think Gods Will Be Watching is necessarily a bad game.  It's a bad game for me, and a bad game for who it's being marketed to.  Some people will probably really enjoy it, but I think that group of people is relatively small.\n\nThey had a good vision for the game and they executed it without compromise.  And then I presume they realized that there's not a lot of money in an excrutiatingly difficult and unforgiving crisis management simulator that's partially RNG dependent and instead marketed the game as some sort of advanced point-and-click adventure game with a lot of ambiguous moral choices to make and consequences to follow.

It manages to capture great pixel graphics, great sound effects and great music. Now, this game has major, considerable flaws:\n\nThe choices in the game don't matter. If you kill a friendly character, he/she comes back alive in the next chapter because else you wouldn't progress in the game (even though they're "dead.")\nThe tasks ordered to do are very tedious, and sometimes boring. Most chapters are basically management of other characters and if you fail, you restart all over again.\nThis game is pure PRD (Pseudo-Random Distribution.) You can fail genuinely because of percentages. If you're a gambler Original mode is for you, but not even Puzzle mode saves you sometimes from the PRD it has, so... Good luck!\n"Puzzles" are not hard (and hence, the game is not long.) They're just insanely difficult (and relies in luck to do so,) and made up so you need to restart and pray to the gods the PRD is merciful the next time you repeat. The worst offender is Chapter 5.\nI'm aware this game was supposed to be very hard from start to finish, and I did enjoy the challenge, it was just tedious to do it over and over again. The chapters are really not worth retrying for the extra stuff and you lose your emotional link with the characters very quick after doing it again and again (and after figuring out they "revive" in the next chapters), and even though this game is reviewed and seen by some other people that it's a "adventure" game, it is not. It is a point-and-click management resource game at its best.\n\nHowever, there's also a good share of what I liked about the game, and some of them were said earlier.\nIt has a very good atmosphere with great music and backgrounds along with neat sound effects.\nThe pixel graphics are done here splendidly and I genuinely enjoyed the cutscenes.\nChapters like the 2nd, the 6th and the 7th were really good. I will let you figure out why (or not.)\nThe story, even though short, it's pretty neat.\nThe gore is also really good here for a pixel game.\nIt has a lot of difficulty settings suited for your liking. Don't want to play the game? Play Narrative mode. Do you find the challenge hard? Play Original Light. However, Puzzle Mode doesn't remove all the PRD...\nEven though there's a lot of good things about the game, the bad things overwhelm the good ones, and it's not a game I would recommend.

Because I like the art style for "Gods will be watching" and that the game is trying something different than other offerings. And I can see how for other people this might be an ejoyable game (as can be seen in the other reviews) however.....this to me is not a fun game to play. And when a game is not fun to play it pretty much becomes work, only without the salary as a reward.\n\nTo my fault I was expecting a point and click adventure or something aking to it, however this game sets you into a specific situation each level. And you have to 'work' at finding a way out of that situation by doing repetitive tasks (key word: repetitive) and if you fail after 10 minutes you can do the whole thing over again from the very beginning.\n\nThe Dark Souls comparison was made, however as opposed to that game, this one feels like the result is more based on luck than actually improving your skills into getting you further into the game. As such (to me) it wasn't satisfying when you cleared a level. It was more a sense of relief that I didn't have to do the same thing again...and again...and again.\n\nThe moral choices don't appear to matter much either, in one level I had people die on my watch only for them to reappear the next. Their characters are now glitching on the screen (that was funny) to show something is not 'right', but essentially their deaths apparantly didn't matter. Nor would your choices.\n\nIf you like puzzle games where the end result is gained by mostly (not all the time) luck as opposed to deducing what to do, then one could try "Gods will be Watching" for an original setting and a game which I find looks pretty cool.

Difficulty for difficulty's sake may appeal to a certain minority of people, but it's intensely off-putting for everyone else. It's even more off-putting when you're made to feel bad for not enjoying the difficulty, or even insulted for it. There's a strange difficulty superiority complex in some gaming circles that I can't quite get my head around, and it leads to some games pitching themselves firmly in Camp Difficult and making a big song and dance about how punishing they are, like it's a badge of honour.\n\nPrior to the update last year, Gods Will Be Watching firmly fell into this camp. On the "original" difficulty, there are random events and unpredictable difficulty spikes that come out of nowhere, ruining any progress you've made in the puzzle so far and forcing you to restart. The usual response to any complaints about this is that they're explained by the end of the story (which they are... kind of), but this doesn't alter the fact that they make playing the game an endurance test rather than anything resembling fun. Go Camp Difficult!\n\nPost-update, however, it's now possible to play the game in a way that feels (mostly) fair, and it's a completely different experience. Stripped of all the rage-inducing random events, the real game can actually finally come out... and I can honestly say I've not really played anything like it. It looks like a point-and-click adventure game, but doesn't play anything like one. Each chapter consists of a chunk of (pretty decent) story exposition followed by a very complex puzzle, usually involving resource and team management across multiple different variables that need to be balanced at all times to prevent catastrophic failure. And you will fail. Even on "easy" mode, you'll most likely have to repeat each chapter a couple of times at least. The difference between doing this on the original and easy difficulties is that on original, you'll have to repeat chapters multiple times because the game randomly fails you over and over, whereas on easy, you only have to repeat the chapters because you've made a mistake or because you've not fully understood a mechanic of the puzzle. This seems like a fair challenge. The puzzles are hard, but not insurmountable, and without the element of randomness it's possible to complete each puzzle through good old logic and planning rather than through sheer perseverance.\n\nI'm really belabouring this point because the game still tries to make you feel bad for playing on anything but 'original', like you aren't experiencing the "true" game, and I suspect many people feel pressured into playing it on original and just give up in frustration. I don't think I could disagree with the developers more about this. The random elements ruin an otherwise brilliant game, and without them the game really shines through.\n\nIn summary: play it, but don't play it on the original difficulty, unless you're feeling particularly masochistic.","October 21, 2015","true","8.1"," 16 of 17 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","16","17","0","0"

The demo is freely available, and was interesting, if bleak-- I never beat it. The demo places you in the role of a Sergeant Burden, stranded with his crew on a hostile planet. It's a game of multi-tasking; you need to keep you and the crew warm, fed, free of disease, keep morale up, repair the radio so you can send out a distress signal, and fend off the local wildlife.\n\nIf that sounds like a lot, it is. Like I said, I never beat the damn thing. I kept focusing so hard on staying on top of things and doing my best to save everyone. I inevitably spread myself too thin, so I would consistently end up saving no one at all. But the demo handled this well, very well, even. Nothing happens all at once-- instead things slowly start going to hell around you, and as you try and patch up one problem, another crops up. By the time you realize things have gotten out of hand, it's too late.\n\nIt's a fascinating approach to handling choice in the storytelling, because it's based so much on knowing how people are going to play the game. It's never posing binary options to you: it asks you to prioritize, and it will actively use perfectionist tendencies against you.\n\nThe full version of Gods Will be Watching steps up the game. Where the demo had no real urgency to it, the first gameplay sequence is a tense hostage situation. The atmosphere very much encourages you to rush, though the game is largly turn-based: time only advances when you make a choice.\n\nIf you rush, you will die. You'll die a lot in general, actually. The game is broken up into multiple discrete scenarios, and until you learn to manage the unique needs of each scenario, you will die repeatedly, even on easy mode. With this comes one of my few quibbles with the game-- there's no quicksave or way to save within a scenario. When you die, you have to start over from the beginning, no matter how far you've gotten. While this plays well into the game's ethos of outright forcing you to sacrifice something, after a few tries it gets really frustrating to have to go through ten or twenty minutes of gameplay over and over again. I would really appreciate being able to drop a save at a mid-scenario checkpoint.\n\nThe art style is that skinny-legged highly-pixelated look that Sword and Sworcery popularized. I'm not a fan of the style but it's skillfully done, and reducing faces to a pixely blur actually helps the mood of the game. It looks good, and the game covers subject matter where it needs to be careful to walk a line between showing too much detail and not enough.\n\nThis is because the game throws you into a torture sequence as its second scenario. It doesn't pull any punches. I was nervous going into this sequence, given you can beat, maim, or kill hostages in the first one. You don't ever really have to, but the option remains open and visible, and I kept wondering if I would have to. In a few failed attempts, I did. But I'm avoiding talking about the torture scenario. It's brutally portrayed-- the heavy pixelation of the graphics is both a relief for being so vague and a horror for leaving enough open to the imagination. It's explicitly not torture porn, because pornography is intended to be pleasurable.\n\nWhich, if anything is, the central flaw of the game. It's not pleasurable: it's a harrowing experience. It's compelling, it's fascinating, but it's not something that will ever make you feel good. I don't think it's important that a game be pleasurable experience, however. It's not something necessary to any other sort of fiction-- most books, movies, and TV will be fun, to be sure, but by no means do any of them need to be fun to be good. But it's definitely something worth noting; you're going to need to hug a pet or loved one after playing.\n\nGoing as far in the game as I have (as I said, it's very difficult; I'm still working on it), it's still in question to me if how you play each scenario affects anything at all about later ones. The game does track, say, if anyone at all dies, but dead characters seem to still appear in the following chapter. Something seems strange about it, though-- I'm not entirely certain if those returning characters are real or some sort of hallucination. I'm not entirely sure if it matters either way, for two distinct reasons.\n\nFirst, the choices you make in the gameplay are the gameplay. It's never really telling you that it's doing it; it's never giving you prompts of "be good person y/n". But every action you take is at the expense of a different action, with its own risks. It's certainly possible to try and go for a 'perfect' run-through or a 'villain' game but without a guide in hand you'll have to take your chances, and only you the player-- the titular, metaphorical 'god'-- will be judging the actions. The game follows through on the notion that it's not assigning a meaning of right or wrong to your actions in a way that few do. The only goal you are given is to survive to the end of the scenario. Anything else along the way is optional, and you're not even informed of what all your options could have been until the end of the chapter. (At the end of each, you're given data on how your actions match up to how others have played the same scenario, something I'm glad to see in wider usage than just Telltale games. This is the closest the game comes to judging you: your overall approach will be characterized with a single word. My attempts to dribble out miniscule amounts of information in order to space out beatings were inevitably characterized as 'suicidal'. The assessment appears to have no impact on play.)\n\nSecond is that GWBW tells a reasonably compelling story. Enough so that I've been fairly circumspect about saying anything at all about it. There's an evil space empire and a rebel group you've infiltrated and an apparently-neutral third party that you work for. Biological weapons and the question of where the line between freedom-fighting and terrorism actually is, and how being personally affected will change where you see those lines. It's heavy stuff, and I don't see the game answering any of those questions for you. But there's a character story in here, too, or more specifically a story about relationships. Donald and Sarah are married, Jack loves the dog that comes along, Burden and Jack go through hell together... and then there's the relationship between Burden and Liam, head of the rebel group Xenolifer. It's strangely intimate, the way Burden speaks about him, hangs so much of his sympathy for the Xenolifer cause on Liam\nhimself. It stands out starkly amidst the stilted phrasing and outright gameness that forces you to keep the game at arm's length.\n\nGods Will be Watching is not an immersive game, but that's okay. It's a game that works best at a distance, when you're treating it as a game to be beaten, a puzzle to be solved, because that's where the failure cascades the game thrives upon come from. If you throw yourself into the place of Sergeant Burden, if you decide in advance what constitutes acceptable losses, you're not going to be feeling that rising dread, and it won't change to panic just before everything goes all to hell.\n\nThe game is by no means flawless; the text of the game is, even where it's grammatically correct, written in stilted, unnatural English. Given Deconstructeam is based out of Spain, I'm neither surprised nor hugely bothered by this lack of conversational mastery, and they know how to use it to create atmosphere. But a more thorough edit is a level of polish that I think would make for a better game.","July 24, 2014","true","10.3"," 160 of 277 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","160","277","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zorder/recommended/274290/","zorder","Zorder","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zorder/","2002 products in account","THIS “REVIEW” HAS BEEN UPDATED.\n\nI had great hopes and I was really hyped to finally play Gods Will Be Watching. I'll admit, I never played the free version that originated the full game and after playing this game I think I should have actually so that I knew what I was getting myself into. Be warned, this might contain SPOILERS!\n\nOn the Steam store page it says that Gods Will Be Watching is "An innovative departure from the traditional point and click adventure taking place in six intimate, tension-filled scenarios linked together through an epic narrative of interstellar espionage.". I have to agree to some extent, it is indeed an "innovative departure from the traditional point and click adventure" type of games but, the way I see it, the scenarios are not "linked together". So basicly the game is divided in several chapters and in each chapter there's a chance one of the characters from your "team" can die but on the other hand even if a character dies, let's say, in Chapter 3, it will still be alive in Chapter 4. This happened to me and I couldn't see a connection because as far as I know Chapter 1 takes place before the second chapter, the second before the third and so on, so I don't see a logical explanation for this, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nPutting that issue aside I can say that I think the game looks absolutely gorgeous and the sountrack is really good and does a great job in putting you in the right mood, atleast it did for me. One other thing that fascinates me in this game is the universe in which the game tooks place, from revolutionary organizations looking to end slavery to undercover operations being carried out by federations and empires that rule part of the galaxy. Overall the universe and the plot is plain great and that also creates another issue for me. It happens often in games that the world where the game takes place is rich and well designed, however some of these games only show you tiny fractions of the universe and I get really sad about that because there's a whole set of opportunities to explore in this world. For example, in Chapter 2 you have to endure torture during a few days and during your torture, your torturer talks with you and he speaks of a Sports League in which players compete but he then tells you that they win by actually killing the enemy team, or atleast that's what I understood. This is a great example of what I mentioned before, the game teases you with great things, yet it doesn't show you anything.\n\nOf course this is very relative from one person to another, you can say I'm pretty much just ranting here but the ranting is just coming now.\n\nWhen I got Gods Will Be Watching I was expecting a standard point and click game with a certain story that was told through a series of choices you made and each choice would lead to a different outcome on the storyline. In the end I was wrong. There's pretty much nothing like that in Gods Will Be Watching, if you don't follow a specific set of "parameters" you lose and you have to start the Chapter all over again. What infuriates me the most is that there's not even a specific path which you have to follow in order to complete a Chapter, most of them are pretty reliant on luck. Having looked for some guides and some walkthroughs on Youtube I saw that the same action could lead to totally different outcomes and sometimes even total failure. I can understand the fact that a game is hard when it doesn't rely on luck, which Gods Will Be Watching certainly does. People that think games like Dark Souls or Ninja Gaiden are hard would hate to play this, that I am sure, atleast in those games you can fight back and turn the tide when in this game you can't, sometimes it reaches a poin where there's nothing but defeat waiting for you, yet the game drags on.\n\nI really want to like this game and I really want to finish it (I'm currently in Chapter 4), but the way you get (pardon the term) screwed over and over just makes me mad and feel like I shouldn't have bought it in the first place because of it's luck based nature. Like I said I don't mind a game that is hard to play and to master, but when a game is trying to tell you a story I just want to enjoy the story without having to worry and to go through all the hassle to find out how to beat a certain level. Some people might be okay with this but I'm totally not. I bought this expecting a narrative experience and I found myself in some sort of survival micro management game trying to make sure I wouldn't make a wrong move or else all my progress until that point would be lost.\n\nI might return to it someday, hell, I might even play it again tomorrow, I honestly don't know. Probably I'll just watch some walkthrough/letsplay on Youtube to see how the game ends because that's what I'm most interested in. I can't really bother myself to spend hours on a single Chapter until the game decides not to shoot me in the face and I manage to get lucky and beat that chapter.\n\nI often compare point and click adventure games to books/movies/tv shows because they present you with a linear storyline and you just experience it, and that's pretty much why I enjoy point and click adventure games, because they tell a story but in an interactive way, in a way a book or a movie can't tell because you're just watching/reading there's no physical input from you that affects when or how the story progresses, and I feel that's the problem with this game, I just can't enjoy the story because of it's luck based design. I really want to recommend Gods Will Be Watching but due to the flaws I've mentioned I think that if you're like me, you won't enjoy this. If you are looking for a game with a good story to enjoy, you probably won't like Gods Will Be Watching, you'll end up "suffering" while experiencing that story and I'm sure I'm not the only one who hates that.\n\nUPDATE: After some tweaking I was able to finish the game on easy. Like I was told, on the last chapter the game finally explains to you, atleast in some way, why someone is alive despite their death on the previous chapter. After beating it, I can say for sure, this has an excellent plot and I find the ending quite remarkable.\n\nDespite that, I honestly can’t recommend the game yet, I still think that it involves a great amount of trial and error and a huge deal of micro management. Please understand this, I don’t think Gods Will Be Watching is a bad game, I think it’s quite good actually. Do I think it stands as an innovative departure from the point and click adventure type of games? Yes. Do I think it stands out as a good narrative driven experience? Yes, but I don’t think the type of gameplay stands out for most people who are looking for a more “casual” narrative experience.\n\nConcluding, the story, the plot, the soundtrack, the graphic style are amazing, however I feel like the type of gameplay that was introduced into the game doesn’t really help to appeal to a larger audience. Some people will love it and some people will hate it. Then there’s probably others like me who are in the middle ground.","July 26, 2014","false","17.7"," 112 of 193 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","112","193","0","10"

The game's pacing, which can be very tedious (as you will fail often) requires a strong emotional commitment to the story. The art, writing and soundtrack help to accomplish that, but so does the challenge inherent in each chapter's puzzle.\n\nEach chapter requires a different type of resource management, so at a basic level you should not hate that type of gameplay mechanic if you're going to invest your time and your money into playing it. But this is no Diner Dash—the situations are dark and fraught with drama, with life hanging in the balance. I found myself playing and failing chapters over and over again, not wanting to stop until I succeeded—and that eventual and inevitable success feels so, so sweet. If you're not into that kind of thing, there are many different modes to play. Some modes take out or minimize random events, others allow it to be the difficult, almost impossible beast that it was designed to be. I think this helps the game appeal to more types of players, while also enhancing its replay factor significantly. If you enjoyed a specific chapter, you can select a chapter to play—I know I'll be trying the Sineicos chapter again.\n\nIt's not a perfect game. The standout example of that to me is when one of my team members perished in a chapter, and I was surprised to find they were alive and well in the next chapter—with no explanation given at the time. It caused the rest of my gameplay experience to be fraught with the question of whether or not it mattered if I tried to play a certain way—namely, keeping the members my team alive. At the time, it compromised the emotional connection I had with the game and its story. I'd thought it was a mistake, and I became wary of whether there would be more mistakes to come. However (without giving anything away) after completing the game, I believe it was intentional and not an oversight.\n\nAll said and done, I freakin' loved it. It's one of my favorites ever, and I can't wait to see more from this developer.","September 7, 2015","true","11.0"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","0"

Your choices may not be the most popular, or the most moral, but they may be the most logical.  Only you and the Gods will be watching.\n\nGods Will Be Watching is a 2D point-and-click adventure regarding the trials and tribulations of Sgt. Burden, an agent of E.C.U.K., the Everdusk Company for the Universe Knowledge, tasked to be undercover in the group Xenolifer to learn about the origins and wherewithal of the Medusea Virus.  Throughout the game, Sgt. Burden is tasked with hard-fought decisions: from which hostages to trade or to kill, to which partner will receive the lethal dose for the sake of a cure.  These choices that Gods Will Be Watching gives you are never clear cut or easy to do, most will have a negative aspect in the short-term but are necessary in the long run to the success of finishing the said mission.  It’s a haunting feeling knowing you may have to kill an important partner to complete a mission because he can take an antidote test better than your other crew, and those uncomfortable feelings are easily worth the price of admission.  It’s hard to come by games nowadays that can make you squirm in your seat because you know what you have to do, but you most certainly do not want to do them.\n\nGods Will Be Watching boasts a retro style that really breathes a lot of life into the scenery.  Even with the disadvantage of having very little specific details in the characters and backgrounds, Deconstructeam does a fantastic job painting a beautiful picture of open worlds and claustrophobic corridors catering to the difficult tasks at hand.  The music that accompanies the brooding situations highlights and builds accordingly to the situations, sinking into your brain and not letting go, making every decision you take even heavier and intense than the last.\n\nThough Gods Will Be Watching is an impactful and thought-provoking game, it’s not a terribly long experience.  Gods Will Be Watching at the most will take you around 7-8 hours on its difficult “Original” mode, with specific tasks to beating each level netting you awards like concept art and illustrations.  Gods Will Be Watching does add different styles to its chapters: Puzzle Mode removes most of the random number generating puzzles and makes the chapters built on a pattern that can be cracked, while Narrative Mode allows an easier run-through of the game allowing one to indulge in the story more so the complex issues that arise from it.  But ultimately once you’ve finished Gods Will Be Watching, the tense atmosphere of not knowing what’ll happen next get lost during your second and third play through.\n\nEven though Gods Will Be Watching is a short, difficult experience, it is an experience that should be recognized and indulged.  The moral choices and brooding atmosphere sucks you in and doesn’t let go, giving the player an uncomfortable, tense, and thrilling rollercoaster of a ride, even if it’s only good for one go around.\n","November 6, 2014","true","7.6"," 17 of 23 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","17","23","0","0"

"Why not kill the doctor? He will spawn in the next chapter! Its not really about the future, its pretty much about how you feel.\n\nJust seeing that life less body makes you feel guilt, it was your fault, even if you cant accept it, it is. You could have avoided that.\n\nBut at the end, does it really matter at all?\n\nAlso, this game is REALLY harsh, this wont end up like typical "And the heroes entered the bad guy's base and killed him and the galaxy was free!

No, sometimes you got to accept the harsh reality.\n\nNo matter how many times you try, you know you cant change that, no matter how many times you wish it.\n\n\nIn my opinion, it had the best ending for a game.

A really simple mechanic (point-and-click) to offer a whole new level of resource management. I must confess the story is not extremely original, yet its esential for the game to work correctly, and honestly, I loved it. The ost is just the kind of music and auditive feedback you wanna listen to while you're repeating a chapter and action over and over again. The pixel art style, animations and setting give it a distinct aesthetic.

And if you want to get metaphysical: How much free will do we really have?\n\nSo before purchasing this game or choosing one of its many gameplay mode (some were added post-release), all you needed to ask yourself are these 2 questions:\n\n1. Will I be OK that, after being tortured and torturing others, after losing not only to my own mistakes but also to random number generators, after going from deeply disturbed by its graphical content to constantly skipping the same content with blind eyes, that my blood-soaked sweat-stained decisions, are yet a mechanism to move its narrative forward?\n\n2. Will I be OK that, with all the positivity I try to instill with my decisions, this game ultimately decides to cast a grim outlook on free will?\n\nIf you are ready for this taoist-esque afterthought, then maybe, you will enjoy playing "Gods Will Be Watching" in its normal (read: most unforgiving) difficulty.\n\nPS: If you decide to do so, just remember neither luck nor keyboard are on your side.","October 25, 2014","true","12.7"," 19 of 28 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","19","28","0","0"

It is absolutely not the game described or aluded to in the trailer: it is a turn-based strategy game: not an adventure.  At best, it is an interesting story with beautiful presentation which requires unreasonable investment of patience from the player to progress.  At worst, it is a tedious, repetetive exercise in keeping counters above a threshold by performing limited actions.  In each chapter, there are basically only about eight actions you have available to you, all of which will add or subtract a predictable amount to some victory condition counters.  This game could easily be represented as a series of numbers and buttons, which is pretty damnable given how the game is positioned - and what I believed it to be.\n\nThe game is not centred around story, and nor are the choices really that affecting: the only choices you are really making are how best to juggle the variables to keep them within the tolerance levels.  As far as I can see, in the first chapter, the only choice you can make that affects anything fundamentally is if you kill hostages rather than let them live when they do make a run for it, your man who is assigned to keeping the incoming forces at bay will refuse to shoot because he is morally damaged.\n\nIf you like resource management, you will potentially find something to like in this as it is very, very hard.  If you like story, you likely won't, because it requires so much effort and frustration to get to the story that you will, like me, feel as though you have been cheated into playing a very different game than you were expecting.\n\nAn experiment that doesn't work, for me, at least.","July 26, 2014","false","2.8"," 73 of 129 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","73","129","0","0"

Unfortunately, that backfired on them and they ended up having to patch in a bunch of different difficulties. But I can't hack it.

It is a VERY interesting approach to point and click. Let me start off by saying that the game is very hard. Usually, it is not to the point that it gets too frustrating, but it actually encourages you to try something different or improve on what has worked until you beat the stage. Although the game does base a lot of its mechanics on luck, there is a certain amount of thrill to some of the gambling aspects in the game. In fact, I do not quite understand why this surprises so many people: luck has always been involved in almost all turn based games. Yet what is much more important than raw luck, is logic and time management, and using your resources in the best way possible. Besides, I always felt like I needed skills and tactics to proceed, with each failure I improved at the game and got a bit further, until I eventually beat the chapter that I was stuck on. Each stage plays very different to the last, which is important, because after failing a few times (which you will, trust me), each stage can get pretty repetetive and variety is desperatly needed. Sometimes it feels like you are just fullfilling a bunch of chores, rather than doing some ethical decision making, and the "ethical dlimena" aspect of the game slightly drowns in the mix. I think that this is also the reason that a lot of people are disliking the game: They were expecting a "Telltale Games" type of product (me included, as I should add), yet this game is actually challenging and requires more thinking than people wanted it to. The idea of loosing in a point and click discouraged a lot of people, but I find it very refreshing and something new. Personally, I would like to see more adventures that challenge and put pressure on the player.\nMisc. Aspects:\nThe asthetic works in my opinion, the art style works, but obviously its not something mind blowing. The sounds are very good, the soundtrack is nice but can get a bit repetetive after replaying the same level severall times, the dialogue is well written. At the end of every stage, you get to see your decisions compared to other people's, which is a good addition.\nConclusion:\nOverall, I can recommend the game, although it is deffinatly not for everyone. Especially casuals will have a hard time and might rage after the first few failed attempts and give up.","July 25, 2014","true","14.2"," 18 of 28 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","18","28","0","0"

You have immediate, unarguable feedback to where you went wrong, and how you can improve so that doesn't happen again.\n\nGWBW, doesn't have that. If you fail, it's unexplained why one of the many integers caused you to lose.\n\nGWBW is all too happy, try and explain the vast majority of what it is, through visual cues and if you can't pick up on them, well tough ♥♥♥♥. You just wasted 30 minutes trying to do scenario? well now you're dead, and you go straight back to the start.\n\nAnd the developers know it, when you start the game you are presented with two difficulty options. Normal wherein the developers say that you will die a lot. And Easy, wherein the devs say, you've tried normal and you now hate us. Cute, but not an accurate representation of difficulty.\n\nIf you were to ask me, for a story based adventure game in where you make critical decisions that affect the outcome of the story. There are many more fun, viable options out there. I can't recommend GWBW, to only the most seasoned of masochists.","August 4, 2014","false","1.8"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","0"

It's a simple point and click adventure game and it does try it's best to give you lots to do, and thanks to that some stuff are easier to solve than others.\nI really hate it when this type of game has nothing to offer and is very bland and boring. but here it's pretty nice and helpful. (Examples: In level 5 you can send a soldier to explore if there are any enemy bases around and if he comes back he tells you everything you need to know.)\n\n\nStory and CharactersGreat story, might have a few flaws but it keeps you on edge and feels real good to explore stuff, there are alot of intresting characters, mostly the antagonists but other than that everyone are pretty intresting.\nLiam is our main antagonist for the most part. Irving is an antagonist for Episode 2 and the difficulty is the villain of this entire god damn game. All the other characters can be annoying and down spirited at one point but other than that they are pretty good.\n\nThe GraphicsThe graphics are beautiful and the character designs are intesting. The overall set and background are amazing and feel genuine and nothing disappointed me me about it.\n\n\nThe SoundtrackThe soundtrack is amazing. every song in this game is beautiful and awesome, I could listen to all of the songs a few times and not get tired from listening. It fits well with the style, story and things that are happening at the moment and I love it.\n\nOverallI love this game, besides the difficulty I like everything about it. Sadly the difficulty highly affects the other things and makes it very unpleasant and irritating and made me ♥♥♥♥ the game off alot of times. you'll be mad at this game alot but overall you'd be happy to finish it.\nIf you can spare 10 bucks and want to waste hours screaming "WHY DIDN'T I DO THIS AND THAT?" give it a try and you will like it.\n\nI enjoyed it and I give it an 8/10","April 22","true","12.2"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","0"

Not for all (or even most) tastes. I'll start this review off with a series of cautions.\n\nThe biggest difficulty with Gods Will Be Watching is it is going to appeal to a very small audience. GWBW is a game where you aren't the all-conquering hero, where people will die through your actions, and where your only satisfaction will come from doing the best you can in the circumstances you draw. In other words, it's a lot like life, and asks deeper questions about why we game or what we expect to take away from a gaming experience, not to mention the 'heroic' avatars we play over and over in games that are so much ego food. GWBW has much more in common with your typical Jason Rohrer game than it does the average indie, let alone AAA title.\n\nFurthermore, do not be fooled by anyone calling this a ' point-and-click adventure game'... it has almost nothing to do with that genre. This is a turn-based strategy game with very strict rules, although utterly unlike any other one out there in the minimalism of its style, substance, and execution.\n\nGWBW itself consists of seven different scenarios, ranging from a hostage crisis, to enduring torture, to wilderness survival, and so on. This is not a 'happy game'. The scenarios are harrowing, to say the least, and many players are going to struggle with a game where they not only don't get to win, but can only hope to minimize loss.\n\nThe goal is simply to get through each scenario in any way the player can, with consequences that you can live with. This sets up a rapidly shifting moral boundary, as necessity will rapidly come to outweigh morality.\n\nThe game boils down to effectively managing all of the variables in these scenarios while trying to keep any of them from falling into a fail-state... which they inevitably will. The scenarios themselves, however--unlike the one-offs of a time/resource management game or a 'quest' game like Oregon Trail--are complex and intertwined. The player will not only need to work to understand those relationships, but also to recognize cues when the situation is tipping too far in any of multiple directions, and to plan and react accordingly.\n\nThis means, to pick one example:\n-understanding what will cause a hostage's emotional state to improve/deteroriate\n-monitoring the visual cues that indicate that hostage's emotional state\n-planning in advance how to control/manipulate that hostage's emotional state\n-having contingencies ready (in mind) if external circumstances interfere with that plan\n-making hard decisions when all of this breaks down due to flawed planning or bad luck\n\nTo some players, the small element of luck/bad luck will be an exhiliarting thrill--an element that twists the story and changes possibilities, taking away control (similar to the great roguelikes) in order to generate emergent story. To others, taht same luck/bad luck will lead to exasperation or a feelign of malicious unfairness, and frequent reloads (especialy if they obsess about 'perfecting' each level). Buyer beware.\n\nThe most succinct thing I can say about this game to help you choose to buy it or not to buy it is: this game IS the choices you make. It's not about the story, or mastering each scenario, or working your way to a pay-off at the end (again, be warned, the ending is going to ♥♥♥♥ off a lot of you if you're looking for validation there). It is about making choices without knowing if the choice you made is 'right' or 'wrong'.\n\nThe soundtrack and pixel art are bar none some of the best of the genre, and much of the dialogue is engaging (when it doesn't fall into tropes) and the debates about the ending will undoubtedly keep the Steam message boards raging for a long time.\n\nIgnore them, play the free Ludum Dare version of the game, and form your own judgment. If you like that, give GWBW a try. It goes well with a nice glass of Chianti and any dog-eared copy of Sartre or Nietzsche.","August 4, 2014","true","12.7"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","10","14","0","0"

I happily paid for the pre-order just on how much I respected their work and their ambition. I'm happy with that payment even as I regret to say, the full game did not pan out well.\n\nI get that it's not much of a point-and-click adventure...but there are ways to do resource-management-clicky games without the baffling design decisions made by Deconstructeam. There's a random-number-generator event in the second level that, no matter how well you've planned out your clicking strategy (which by this point, is dozens and dozens), one roll of the dice immediately kills you and sends you back to the beginning of a 15 minute long click fest. It's perhaps the dumbest, most bewildering design decision I've ever seen in a game (at least, in this decade). It's more fun to turn off the game and contemplate what exactly was going through the designers' minds when they thought that would be a worthwhile addition. I pity the game testers that had to sit through that part. But that assumes there were even any game testers, which I think is a questionable assumption given how clunky this game turned out to be. The sad part is, the problems are so endemic to the design that I don't see how a "bug patch" will fix them without completely changing the game.\n\nThat said, again, I'm happy with my pre-order purchase...indie games need support and hopefully GWBW will be a footstep for this studio to go on and create much better games in the future.","July 26, 2014","false","3.2"," 15 of 24 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","15","24","0","0"

It's not the graphics style or controls I am fine with those my issue is that I was expecting from the video was a set of scenarios I could choose to play out and experiment with but sadly that is not the case.\n\nInstead what we have here is a series of scenarios you play through in order - tried to play through the first in the recommended difficulty and I just repeatedly failed, it did not seem to matter what I chose and the biggest issue was the lack of visual clues of how well you were doing and how the hostages were responding. One minute all seems to go well and in a second later the hostages run one by one and you can either let them go free or shoot them - all winding up wth you having no hostages and failing soon after. Alternately you concentrate on the hostages and the guards take you out.\n\nWhat looked like a game where I could play out these scenes with some experimentation end enjoy different narrative outcomes is in fact a linear experience - someone will no doubt post a guide up that you have to follow to get a win for each scenario - but where is the real fun in that?

(The story is good until the end)\n\nDon't get me wrong here, I think GWBW is (for the most part) a good game to some degree, It offers an experience that many games fail to capture and create, a gritty and intense point 'n' click game that will have you on the edge of your seat and make your hands sweat and the thought of some of the decisions you will have to make, or at least, that is what I first thought.\n\n( Before I continue, I am not saying the developers were lying about this, this is Gods Will Be Watching, not The War Z, but as I continue, you will see what I mean. )\n\nAll of that is merely and illusion, at first, you will be grinding your teeth like a madman, and twitching like a hyperactive 5 year old, but then you see the bigger picture, and you realize the fact that all those things simply aren't true anymore.\n\nFor Example, there are choices you will have to make, choices that at first seem important, but these choices don't even matter in the long run. ( i.e: ***SPOILERS*** There are multiple decisions in the game that can lead to the deaths of certain members of your posse, but in the next chapter, they can all be back and ready to go, even though the just died in the last chapter/ And yes I know about the ending, I will get to that later. ***SPOILERS***  )\n\nThe choices only matter for the chapter you are on, it no longer makes the game intense and nerve-racking, it turns the game into a resource management game, where you have to restart every time something goes wrong, it sucks out all the fun I had with the game.\n\nThe games has no checkpoints, great for all you hardcore gamers and dark souls elitists, but for me, it was just another sucker-punch to the gut every time I failed. And yes I realize 'that is the way the game is meant to be', but is it really, you could of at least put in a few save points, like when you get to the second stage in chapter 3. It can get frustrating having to play the same mission over and over again to get to the point you were last at.\n\nLike this one time, I was 2 days away from escaping the planet in chapter 4, and everyone was fine, healthy and mostly happy, the campfire looked like it had one or two more days in it, ( The last day flame looks pretty big for what it is ) so I talked to everyone and cooked some food, but boy was I wrong, the next day the fire went cold, not to worry I thought, I'll just make a new one, so I got some wood and placed it one the campfire, now time to light it, but wait, no more bullets left, and Sgt. Burden being the mong he is said the fire couldn't be re-lit without bullets, so we all froze to death with one day left. Couldn't be re-lit, what was that bloody flame torch Donald has to repair the radio, and don't tell me it isn't a torch, 'cause it both looked and sounded like one, I would place my bets that it also tasted, smelt and felt like one too.\n\nSo fast-forward a few chapters and you get to chapter 7, the big bad boss of the game, what will the final chapter be? A combination of all that we have learn't from the other chapters, rolled into one hard-as-nails mega chapter. No, a prolonged game of Simon ♥♥♥♥ing Says, not joke, go to Youtube and watch it if you haven't already beat the game, I'll wait for you.\n\nYes the climax of the game is Simon Says. ***SPOILERS*** In this chapter, Burden starts to dribble story and exposition about how he has done this a million times, where Liam said the same thing I was thinking, 'Burden are you insane', this is the part where it only confirmed my suspicions, Burden was crazy and this was all some twisted perspective on the story, and that Burden was really Alexander or something, but much to my surprise, no. ***SPOILERS***\n\nNow I am going to spoil the ending, look away now if you don't want it spoiled, don't say I didn't warn you. ***SPOILERS*** It turns out that Burden is stuck in some looping paradox, where he  replays the the events, or chapters if you will, over and over. Aside from this being the worst way anyone could possibly end anything, apart from maybe it was all a dream or some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, it turns the game into a one big '♥♥♥♥ You!' to the player. It was like the nice men and women from Deconstructeam offered me a deal that was too good to refuse, then they quickly beat me with socks stuffed with the frozen tears of the last guy or girl.\n\nAfter you beat Liam in a game of Simon Says, Burden spouts some more about what he is doing is the right thing, and if this is all meaningless if he is just going to do it again, but this time he finally beat Liam, and I thought he had broken the cycle, Burden says a few last words to Liam before choosing to cure the planet or to let Xenolifer do its thing, ( The endings are no different, it is just what direction the cure floats in ) and letting himself get carried away to the void of space and time.\n\nI was genuinely sad at this, the music in the background was perfect and you could just imagine Burden's thoughts and feels, that maybe he had finally broken the cycle, and in some heart-breaking final stand of emotion, commit suicide. So I sat there, all depressed at the ending, I liked Burden, really I did, then all of a sudden, wormhole portal that continues the loop, ( from what I understand ) and Burden just floats into it, I was no longer sad, I was angry, come on he beat them, he won, but he still has to do all that again. It turned that '♥♥♥♥ You!' into  a massive flaming '♥♥♥♥ You!' with twisty nip-tassels.\n\nIf I have misunderstood the ending, and he really when into a black-hole and was atomically destroyed, then that makes it even sadder.

I'm on chapter 4 in original mode (the hard mode and i have never tried easy mode) and I don't feel this game is too frustrating. The game is all about risk management and figuring out the mechanics. I've managed to keep my entire team alive just with proper micro-management. This game's strategy is all about micro-management and assessing your risks. It is not a point and click adventure like what many have been led to believe. This is a good game to pick up if you're looking for a puzzle game (which is what it should have been advertised as). It's not a game about "moral dilemma with hard choices" like many believed. Indeed, people who were "sacrificed" come back to life in the next chapter. Just keep in mind what kind of game this really is before buying it.\n\nThere is an RNG factor in the game but there are plenty of ways around it. SPOILER: The one exception is the russian roullette part. There is still a higher chance of winning at this part if you know what you are doing, but I still agree that it's kinda cheap. When you get good at this game, you will realize that the chances of RNG completely screwing you over is actually extremely slim. I actually found Chapter 3 to be easier than the first two chapters. That may be because I'm learning how the game works instead of complaining about the RNG.\n\nLosing is actually not frustrating in this game as long as you learn from it. You learn from how you failed at the game's "puzzle" and what you can do next time. This leads to some trial and error but not really in a frustrating way in my opinion. You're trying to figure out how to solve a puzzle which means finding what fails and what works.\n\nI give the game an 8/10. Working around the game's RNG can be fun but there are certain parts where it's just cheap (like the russian roullette). I recommend it to anyone who likes puzzle games but that's about it.","July 30, 2014","true","10.0"," 21 of 36 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","21","36","0","1"

That is ridiculous. People are different. My recommendation to a person should be based on what I know about that person.\n\nI'll post here what I posted to my guildmates. This game is different. It is not for everyone. It is not a matter of the game/story/etc. being either good or bad. The game is what it is and some can appreciate that while others cannot.\n\nThe best rule of thumb is to play the free demo/ludum dare entry. Liked it? Then you should like what awaits in the new scenarios. If you didn't like it, then don't expect to feel differently about the product for sale. This warning shouldn't be necessary, but if you don't have any tolerance for trial and error, then perhaps don't bother even playing the demo.\n\nThis game has its roots in minimalism, and deals with difficult subject matter. Your experience(s) will be unique to your personality. If you don't like to have your beliefs challenged, then stay away. If you want the game to tell you what to think, rather than thinking for yourself, then stay away.\n\nI'll even go so far to say that if you are at all inclined to think of things as being good or bad, rather than accepting the fact that not everything can please everyone (and therefore is not required to do so), then just stay away. There's no need to trash the game on the basis of nothing but your petty bias.\n\nIt is hardly relevant to you, but I very much enjoyed it.

Based on that, you may or may not disagree with my assessment as this is NOT A BAD GAME, simply not what was advertised.\n\nACTUAL REVIEW:\n\nIf you want a story-based experience of tough choices: do yourself a favor and play Unrest instead.\n\nI bought Gods Will Be Watching assuming it to capture at least some of the hard human decision-making that made games like Always Sometimes Monsters, The Walking Dead, The Wolf Among Us, Mass Effect and others so unique and brilliant. Unfortunately, Gods Will be Watching had none of this.\n\nStraight away, the game throws the player into a situation that may seem morally interesting at first, but is soon realized to be nothing other than a simple (as in: not complicated, but still very hard) time management game. It is at this point where it dawned on me that this was, in fact, competing not with the games mentioned above but with Cook, Serve, Delicious and the like - only that it was doing so badly.\n\nAs the player never really learns about their character or has any chance to immerse themselves in the setting, the "moral choices" one has to make are appropriately bland and meaningless. Even worse, some decisions turn out to actually have no effect - for example, in at least one instance, a dead crew member comes back to life in the level after they were killed without a mention and sticks around to provide dialogue. Decision-making is limited to the aforementioned time management and resource exchanges (shooting a hostage earns more time, but costs a hostage). Moral dilemmas? Not really.\n\nWhat the game has going for it are its beautiful pixel graphics and its soundtrack. If you are looking for a challenging time-management puzzle game, Gods Will Be Watching can be an interesting distraction. I, personally, was disappointed by its lack of character and narrative.","July 24, 2014","false","2.1"," 94 of 176 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","94","176","0","0"

Eventually, I did like the atmosphere and I approve of the art, music and even the setting as the game's greatest merits. However, the systems and the story told simply don't play along nice.\n\n\nTake Chapter 2 for instance. You're captured and are brutally tortured. The retort between your torturer who explains himself and the way you hold out by crafting an elaborate web of lies are actually pretty riveting... for the first 3 times.\n\nThen the game falls flat and literally pulls out its own carpet out from under itself in this dialogue:\n\n"There has to be a pattern to his torture. Most psychopats have."\n"Yeah, if only I had a dozen lives to figure it out."\n\n\nAnd you do! And its such a disappointment in its own way. Took me getting beaten to death twice to figure out begging actually works when you're in the bleeding posture, took me 6 drawn molars to realize I'm pretty safe lying after constructing a ruse by thinking twice.\nI've now been killed thrice by getting ripped in half on the torture rack.\nIf that sounds extreme; don't worry. You'll get used to it. The game loses a lot of its charm and all investment you could have had for the plight of your characters, as you conquer its systems instead of enjoy the experience, which is the exact opposite of what I wanted. The survival horror is still present, but the game fails to marry it with the mechanics.\n\n\nNow, this is a tough game. I recognize that. I'm not even punishing it for that and I'm not part of the conga-line of people that blame the game for being too hard or random. I'm the kind of guy that whips out a pen and paper whenever the game befuddles me and I can promise you that a lot of these actions aren't as random as you might think, or can be compensated for by mastering other factors.\nAnd very rarely, yes, it is simply Russian Roulette - literally so in Chapter two torture scene where a seven bullet gun with one chamber loaded is placed against your head. Things like that are the only factors that are completely random (inside an otherwise predetermined routine mind you), but oddly enough this was the only situation that after neatly figuring out how to survive the entire jount and the most grizzly tortures on paper, that still managed to get a kick out of me and made me deeply empathize with what was on-screen. Didn't bat an eyelash being tore in two on the rack or getting an arm lobbed off since I know how to avoid that, but damn if that gun didn't made me turn away and close my eyes every frackin time. Its been a long time a game made me do that.\n\n\nBut do hostages that detailed truly add to the situation, or do they simply become faceless fickle systems you need to master? And why are their random failstates in a game I've learned to play as a spreadsheet system, even though those are sometimes the best moments? Should they be? Can I truly feel for characters I've seen die and resurrect more times than I care to count? (Even though I still really enjoy seeing these characters getting fleshed out under such bizarre circumstances.)\n\nAll of it is simply too disjointed.\n\n\n\nI still think there are moments of brilliance though. The concept sounded really good on paper and some of the systems work brilliantly, even though not unified enough to create an end-product that I can recommend or understand.\n\nIf Gods Will Be Watching can be compared to a failed product other than a game, than it would be a wrongly crafted piece of jewelry where all the gemstones poke haphazardly out of an ugly clump of gold.\nI just wish someone would take note of the design and not the result, to create the game that I would have liked Gods Will be Watching to be.","July 28, 2014","false","20.3"," 11 of 17 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","11","17","0","0"

Because it is not as advertised. It is no 'open choice point and click adventure' of any sorts.\n\nWhat it is, in fact, is a 2D pixel game where you use trial and error in the hopes of not ♥♥♥♥ing up a given scenario. This may sound fun, but within 20 minutes it becomes damn frustrating. There's no sign of the open world, choice driven, multiple storyline plot that the game advertised itself as being.\n\nThe learning curve is also incredible. I managed to barely scrape by after about 20 attempts on Easy, but on Normal I'm seriously unsure of what I'm doing wrong - again, I don't have much room to actually make my own choices, I just learn from dying over and over until the scenario can be beat. Some of it doesn't even make sense - choices that should have a positive outcome by any logical standard ruin everything for no reason.\n\nI'd describe it as..a very pretty 2D game, sure, but more of a linear, 'don't shoot hostage A because you've learned hostage B will run after your fiftieth death' kinda game. The graphics, characters, and plot are all there (although the plot could be described as choppy at best.)\n\nThe bugs in the game, as there are many, that are frequent (random white screens, sound issues, crashes) can be fixed with patches, the core mechanics of this game cannot. If you are looking for a game that is adequately 'a game' but does nothing it advertised, this game is perfect for you. If you're looking for the game described, keep looking.\n\n5/10.

The game records the actions you are using to be succesful in that scenario and if you do complete it, it will display actions that other players had to do to be succesful in %.\nHence the name Gods Will Be Watching.\n\nThe puzzle part comes from how can you keep the scenario under control while achieving 1 goal. For example:\nFirst Scenario has you managing hostages: keep them too relax or nervous and they will try to escape or attack your team\nMaganing a hack: you have to keep a security bar at the highest or risk a system shutdown while trying to get a hack boost bar at it highest.\nKeeping a swat team away from the doors of the office your team is barricaded in.\nYour team might panic and you will need to calm them down\n\nIf you fail, lose all hostages, swat team attacks, you get attacked and die or your team panic, you will restart the whole scenario. And everytime you restart the scenario you will be having the same conversation with the hostages, the swat and your team. Plus the scenarios can have random factors in it, kicking a hostage might make the other 3 nervous in this playthrough.... or not. It gets repetitive and stale pretty fast.\n\nGets so stale that when you get the stat screen, showing the % of what other did in that scenario, you really dont much care since you did whatever it took to get out of that level and just move on with the story.\n\nI would not recommend because of its scenario restart, repetitive gameplay and random elements to completing scenarios.

But that's part of its beauty.\nAt first, I too had the impression that the HEAVY emphasis on difficulty and the amount of focus on succeeding unecessarily distracts you from actually questioning the morality of your actions, but after a while I begin to realize that this is EXACTLY the point;\nthe game is hard and cruel and unforgiving, and it is up to you whether you will lose your cool and become a ruthless, abusive monster driven by nothing than your wish to beat the game, or whether you will maintain your solidarity and humanity even against such impossible odds.\nAnd it IS possible to win and yet do things right, never doubt it!\n\nSo that's the biggest, greatest plus of Gods Will Be Watching - to sum it up in different words, the game will put ridiculous pressure on you, and the real beauty of it is not so much in beating each chapter as rather in HOW you beat each chapter, how hard you will try find the right balance between being effective and being self-destructively kind and naive.\nIt is fair to say that the main strenght of the game is not so much in what happens on the screen as in what happens within you while you struggle with frustration. (though, to be fair, not once have I gotten frustrated to the point of being angry at the game, despite having to repeat each level good three to eight times)\n\nThe second thing that I feel I must praise is the incredible diversity.\nEvery chapter has entirely different setting, mood and atmosphere, and that is rare to say at least. Thanks to this, the game never gets boring or repetetive - I mean, DAMN! Just when I thought I had a pretty good idea about what I am into, after resorting to terrorist actions for nonetheless decent cause, through surviving in extremely hostile enviroment and withstanding torture, BAM! I find myself stranded in the middle of the desert in hopeless battle against both the enemy forces and the never-ceasing heat.\nI can't really find the words to describe this aspect of the game, so let me just call it what I feel it is: MAGIC! DONWRIGHT MAGIC!\n\nFinally, the writting is excellent. The plot is grown-up and doesn't resort to dividing characters into good guys and bad guys, the characters you meet are all unique, believable and relatable (not to mention likeable - Liam! You magnificent ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥!),\nand quite soon you will find yourself caring for them.\n\nBrazillion outta ten; I am happy beyond words to see a game such as this, and wish to see many more in the future.\nThis is where gaming meets art. This is where gaming becomes an instrument that further encourages exploration of the human nature and nudges you towards unsettling and unusual questions about yourself and the world around you, rather than being just means of entertainment.","July 25, 2014","true","8.9"," 15 of 25 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","15","25","0","0"

If you were intrigued by this game's gripping premise, and the idea of making solid moral choices, stay away, because this is not the game you thought it was.\n\nWhat was sold as a "thriller" where players "face intriguing puzzles and tough decisions" is actually just a repetitive puzzle game. It places you in situations which are ripe with difficult moral choices, except none of the choices are actually choices - they're decisions that function as mechanics to a predetermined goal. Saving or killing a hostage is not a choice, but instead a method of keeping the guards at bay. Succeeding or failing at your missions are not complex dillemas that were made on the back of your hard decisions - they're calculated and mathematical uses of the mechanics in your surroundings to accomplish an objective, with a failure resulting in a simple Game Over screen.\n\nIt's just sad. This game had so much potential, and it just did not live up to expectations or the merits with which is was sold on. Although the premise is good, the writing is janky; although the art is beautiful, the execution of the game mechanics are convoluted; although the story is intriguing, it's also ham-handed, repetitive, and not very expressive.

It's a game of tough decisions. Ultimately it is possible to save everyone but it will often require practice, planning and a bit of luck to pull off. Speaking of luck, the game has a degree of RNG that ensures that you are never certain that everything will go according to plan, however you are usually given tools to avoid risking too much as well. This is however still something that can put people off, so the developer was kind enough to add a 'puzzle mode' which reduces the effect of RNG. The game is still however pretty difficult, expect to fail a few times till you get through it. The game does come with an 'easy' mode that makes the challenges noticeably easier to overcome, but there's a reason the developer states that the game should be played on normal and I also feel it ruins the experience to go 'puzzle mode' or 'easy mode'.\n\nIn the end I recommend it provided you're not put off by the difficulty, particularly if making tough decisions is your thing.","December 3, 2015","true","17.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/quixoticsamio/recommended/274290/","quixoticsamio","Samio","http://steamcommunity.com/id/quixoticsamio/","128 products in account","Overview\nGames are usually fun activities. People are presented with challenges, given a set of tools, the promise of a winning state (or several) and through the use of those tools the player is expected to reach that win state. This process may be hard or easy, complex or simple, but it's bound by explicit rules and the player is expected to have a fair shot at victory. Also, it's expected that though the process might imply some frustration, the overall experience is pleasant and fun.\n\nThat's the usual fare for videogames.\n\nGods Will Be Watching is not like those videogames.\n\nNot all human art is pleasant. Some is unpleasant due to a lack of skill, it's just bad art. But some art has as its goal to  be unpleasant. Example: horror movies produce fear (...or camp), so do horror games. Or, say, Lars von Trier movies also tend to involve the darker, unwelcome parts of the emotional range. And some people like those experiences. Not all people, but some do. And while movies that seek to explore the emotional range of paranoia, fear, shame, etc., are not for everyone, it is good that those subjects are explored. And just like some of those movies try from design to produce unpleasant emotions, Gods Will Be Watching has as its intended artistic goal to make the player experience anguish, stress, frustration and despair.\n\nGods Will Be Watching [GWBW from now on] is not a game everyone should play. But GWBW is a good game. GWBW takes a hard bet, it sets out to evoke emotions of futility and frustration on the player, through the unique aesthetic channel of videogames: interaction. GWBW's original (and intended) mode will sometimes force you into unwinnable scenarios. It has internal randomness. It is arbitrary. It is unfair. It is cold and uncaring. It will make you feel like you just wasted hours of your life in a task that, in the end, you didn't have any choice in overcoming.\n\nBut that's exactly what GWBW sets  out to do. It's the aesthetic and moral lesson of the game. If this is not something you want to experience, skip GWBW. But if you have an appreciation for existentialism and think Camus' The Myth of Sisyphus was not hardcore enough, GWBW is exactly the experience you're looking for.\n\nVisuals\nThe pixel art helps soothe what would be an unbearable experience. It's beautiful and well animated. Every character is given a unique presence. Given the constraints of the game, it does a lot with very little. I can't see the game presenting its style through anything other than these pixel visuals. Less and it'd take away from the visual cues, more complexity and the game would suffer from it.\n\nAudio\nGoodness, the game's music is amazing. Given the strong role of emotions in this game, music had to have a strong presence and it pays off perfectly. The soundtrack is closest to space ambient, it's always dark, alien and melancholy. Some tracks are plain oppressive, some more intense and some carry a feeling of keeping a small ember of hope against a hostile reality. Fingerspit does an excellent job. Experiencing the soundtrack along with the game's narrative is worth the game's price alone.\n\nGameplay\nWhile the interface may seem like a more traditional point and click adventure game, there are no item oriented puzzles or riddles. The gameplay centers around survival and resource management. It involves calculation, experimentation and trial-and-error. Failure is part of this game's narrative. You are expected to be overwhelmed by choices with no clear indication of their results, fail, learn from that failure and eventually overcome what's essentially an economical challenge - one that involves incredibly cruel moral dilemmas.\n\nAgain, from the overview, this is not for everyone. But what it plans out to do, it does so spectacularly.\n\nStory & Narrative\nAnother stellar feature of this game. The game has very little text or dialogue, but what little it has is presented with maximum efficiency. The story of the game, including the DLC Chapter, is very rich and will leave you thinking for a long time. Philosophers, mathematicians and fans of science-fiction especially will get a lot from this game.\n\nOverall\nGods Will Be Watching is everything the mainstream gaming market is not. It's audacious, creative, does not pander to fans. It springs from an artistic need to express and explore emotions not everyone wants to consider. GWBW is cruel, unforgiving, many times frustrating - it does not provide escapism, it does not massage the ego of the player through power-fantasies. Its demographics are small and it has ♥♥♥♥♥♥ a lot of people off (just see other reviews for this game).\n\nAnd because of this, it deserves the mountains of praise I am giving it. It's not what everyone needs or wants, GWBW is everything videogames need right now.

No.  Is it for the sadistic?  Yes.\n\nThe casual mode I have yet to try maybe it's better.. Not sure. I'm sure the story by itself is fun, but the intergrity of the game's often lost in those senarios.  I would recommend this game for those die hard adventure quest genre people.

A lot of people seem to have similar complaints, but I'll try to keep this relatively condensed.\n\nWhat you are promised/expecting:\nA point-and-click adventure game, filled with moral dilemmas, something that will make you "feel bad" - as PC Gamer says in the little blurb given on Steam. This sounds fun, it sounds like a game that has a solid story, and very interesting psychological/ethical questions accompanying it.\n\nWhat you get:\nPerhaps the only quote that is really accurate is "There's no good or evil, just decisions, with only you and the gods as a judge to your actions." While this quote was probably meant to make the reader think "I'll be in such dire situations that any action can be justified!" What it comes to mean is that the game is a monotonous disaster, and none of your choices are really evil or good, by the end of the game you're going through the motions. The game is compromised of several ball-breaking puzzles, and there is certainly some incentive to make moral decisions at first. However, it quickly becomes clear that there are very few options, by the end you don't care if you're shooting the civilian, or calming them, it's whatever you have to do to get to the next level. Why? Because you've seen all of this dialogue and these situations over and over again. The game is at its worst when you are killed half a dozen times, and you have to read through the same dialogue time and time again.\n\n\nI myself played through one level, and part of the second. The dialogue wasn't particularly engaging, and the story was a bit dull. The dialogue sometimes feels very bland, or immature. The characters are not very believable, and having people tell you game mechanics in character destroys any immersion. I've had a hard time picking this game up again, and it'll probably sit unplayed in my library. One of the biggest disappointments I've come across in a long time.\n","January 3, 2015","false","1.3"," 11 of 18 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","11","18","0","0"

It looked like someone took all those extreme "would-you-rather" or "what-if" nightmare scenarios that friends sometimes play and mashed it with the heavy moral weight ala Telltale's The Walking Dead. What will you do to survive? Will you sacrifice your humanity?\n\nSadly, this all falls flat in the execution. First off, this game is VERY difficult (which is not necessarily a bad thing). However, each  failure feels like a punishment as the game makes you start over from the very beginning of the chapter. This would not be an issue if each chapter weren't so long (it tooke me at least an hour and a half to complete the first chapter). Adding to this, the options available to you for each scenario is fairly limited. Add that to the frequent deaths going back to square one and each chapter can feel like a real drag. Whereas The Walking Dead made each decision have a real weight to it that would really affect your environment, this game makes each decision feel significantly less important. This is due to the fact that after a while you start to realize that you are going to be repeating that same decision every time you have to restart the chapter. The final episode of Telltale's the Walking Dead would have had a lot less emotional punch if you kept on having to ask Clementine to shoot you.\n\nFinally, it seems as though every scenario has a very narrow set of sequential actions that will allow you to move on to the next chapter. This results in each chapter feeling more like a guessing game rather than an actual scenario where each decision feels wholly your own. Ultimately, this was what really drove my decison to give this game a thumbs down. Stick with  Telltale's the Walking Dead if you want a game with weighty moral dilemmas.","July 24, 2014","false","8.9"," 30 of 55 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","30","55","0","0"

I happened to come across it and thought the style of the game was appealing, so I preordered it. However, after playing it for multiple hours and understanding the core concept and design philosophy, I can say that this is truly a gem among adventure games.\n\nStarting out the game, I was quickly introduced to the story and characters and then quickly placed into the first scenario. Without spoiling anything, I was tasked to, essentially, multimanage multiple situations in conjunction with completing the ultimate task at hand. It requires a lot (emphasis on LOT) of trial and error before you understand what exactly you need to do before accomplishing the goal. It took me around 20 times or so before I finally finished the first scenario, and that included a lower in difficulty at the half way mark.\n\nWhich brings me to my next point. This game is incredibly difficult and oftentimes unforgiving. This works in sync with the story since it always places the protaganist in seemingly impossible situations. You could be nearly complete with a scenario and then suddenly have everything go wrong at the press of a button. Despite this issue, albeit frustrating, the difficulty is what makes the game. Through trial and error, you will figure out strategies from past mistakes and rethink your approach to the situation. I believe this to be the core design philosophy of the developers, however, this idea can be muddled if you become infuriated with the constant failure. To quell this frustration a little, I'd advise starting with Easy unless you are brave enough and want to suffer through the game repeatedly.\n\nAnyways, thats the jist of the game. It's difficult, but you defitinely feel a strong sense of relief after each scenario. Before you call the game off as bad, however, I advise really thinking about the game's design in conjunction with its storyline. I think if more players unlocks this "not-so-secret" secret, then they will feel a little more appreciative and connected to the game.\n\nAdvice for newcomers:\n- Start at Easy difficulty so you will enjoy what the game has to offer the first time through.\n- Take your time and really think through your options. Time progresses only when you do an action, therefore keep calm and breath through the situations.\n- Expect things to go wrong. Since a lot of the game relies on chance and probability, make sure you have a backup plan before you go all in.\n- Take extra time to read what the scenario instructions (if available) tell you to do.\n- Guessing is inevitable.","July 28, 2014","true","12.3"," 15 of 26 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","15","26","0","0"

But to do this, the game would need to present you with various possibilities where its hard to decide what the moral thing to do. You can see that sort of thing in "The Walking Dead" or "Papers Please".\n\nInstead, we get something more akin to a 'pacifist' achievement that sometimes appears in AAA titles like Dishonored, Mirrors Edge or Metro. Im not against those kinds of achievements and options, however that is more akin to a difficuly level, rather than an exploration of ethics.\n\nFor example, the second mission is fantastic, you are being tortured and you must survive day after day of torture, but where is the ethics problem? You can try to survive at the cost of your friends life....or try to get both of you through.\n\nI was hoping for something more grey, e.g. Both live but let enemies gain information that endangers innocents, vs letting friend die.","June 21, 2015","false","2.5"," 19 of 34 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","19","34","0","2"

It was not.\n\nPros:\n*Decent looking story. I mean it's got it's originality.\n*Great pixel art. I'm a sucker for it.\n*Cool end-of-mission screeens. They can compare the actions you did on a level with everyone else who bought the game.\n*Ok # of outcomes.\n\nCons:\n*I can't connect with the characters due to their semi-bland personalities, fully bland jokes, and PLEASE SHUT THE FRONT DOOR dialogue. This makes testing my morality EXTREMELY easy.\n*Runs ENTIRELY on luck. If a game were to have luck integrated into it (like Fallout's VATS system), then I'd hold my tongue. BUT to consider a mission successful based on percentages is pure bull.\n\nI can tell how fun a game is based on whether I want to replay it and whether to increase the dificulty when I do so. This game says ITS REEAAAAAALLLLY RECCOMMENDED if you play it on "normal" dificulty to get the full experience, and then it kicks you in the balls with the borderline impossible gameplay. There are games out there where dying is constant and seemingly endless (Dark Souls), but this game determines your odds of success LITERALLY by a percentage and not by the skill of the gamer. If you play it on easy mode it makes a difference, but you're not enjoying the game the way the devs want you to.\n\ntl;dr: The developers made promises it couldn't keep up to, it relies soley on percentages and not skill, the characters are bland.

A few of the challenges seem to have very high impacting elements of luck involved which makes them more irritating but they are in the minority while the remainder, while still usually being impossible on the first attempt, do each offer ways to learn and improve and give you a better chance of success by doing so which is very satisfying. What may not be expected of a game about moral dilemma and sacrifice is that if you do happen to let one of your comrades die in a certain chapter of the story they will not continue to be dead. The chapters tell the story while you are tasked with trying to get the outcome where ideally nobody dies.\n\nThe graphics and music are lovely for complementing the characters and atmosphere. I've always thought that games with similar graphics to this tell their stories well. The music is bittersweet and reminds me almost of Chrono Trigger's which is of course amazing. The story is interesting and kept me hooked but was very blurry to begin with, coming together nicely at the end (Spoilers for this and Undertale: which has elements of what Undertale does best with temporal loops and it's use of the "fourth wall"). The extra mission is a must-play for the explanation it gives. Do not leave this game without completing it. It should be the last chapter not just labelled the "extra mission" because the game is incomplete without it.\n\nRecommended for those patient enough to get through some of the luck based encounters and who will enjoy replaying levels to adapt to succeed in them. In return you'll get a neat little bittersweet story looking at the lives of some impressive characters that deal with harsh situations and try desperately to avoid the inevitable. Also some nicely humourous moments through dialogue and gameplay (I laughed at two of the chapters where I failed instantly after ending the first turn). Again, play the extra mission.","January 2","true","11.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

While the game can drag on forever sometimes it also makes you really feel something if you stay for the ride.\n\nGods will be Watching is a survival- and recourse management game. You will be put in all sorts of situations where your survival will need sacrifice in one way or the other and you will have to choose between bad or worse. The problem for some people will be that these situations can drag on for a long time and require a lot of trail and error, but they also become extremely tense and rewarding.\nIn between chapters there is a text heavy and quite philosophical storyline, taking place in a dirty futuristic, intergalactical setting, which was intriguing for me, but might put some people off. While asking lots of big questions, the storyline is not very deep, but charming nontheless.\n\nI would recommend this game to people who want to feel something and know they have patience.

The player will make decisions that will result in a variety of outcomes: the loss of characters, the altering of the story, advancement or failure. It's actually more a mathematical exercise than anything in that it's pure crisis management. Each decision you make will maintain or improve certain aspects of the scenario while others decline (ex. using actions to go hunting for food may provide meals, at the expense of preparing camp for the night to fend off wolves or to make a fire to stay warm), and the player must manage each of them to the best of their ability in order to keep everyone alive.\n\nGods Will Be Watching gets a thumbs up from me just because it's something different and it executes its idea well, though is basically just a mathematical exercise with story laced into it.

And some games are such a dark, odd trip that after completing them I'm left just blinking and wondering what could possess someone to make it. Gods Will Be Watching ticks both those boxes on the grand list of "indie game weirdness", I'm happy to say.\n\nGWBW is sold as something of a point and click adventure game, but is sort of more turn-based crisis management simulator. Sure you can point and click on things to make things happen, but most interactions you can choose to make consume time, and the scenarios it puts you into are generally quite short on that. Though thankfully you can move at your own pace and real time isn't a factor in between decisions. Constantly spinning plates, you're tasked with maintaining several things at once, where neglecting even one for too long will send things spinning out of control towards disaster.\n\nFrom hostage situations, to torture rooms, to survival situations and more, each of the seven chapters across its space opera setting put you into what seem like almost impossible scenarios, and let you try to figure out a way to salvage things. There is no morality meter, and many scenarios offer you some very shady options should you feel you need to resort to them. You can sacrifice people for the good of the team, threaten or harm a child to make his parents talk, even resort to cannibalism. All these actions have downsides of their own, but the game's never going to call you a bad person if you use them.\n\nThe base game makes heavy use of randomness, meaning that even with a perfect strategy, if there is such a thing, things can fail. Frequent failure and experimentation until you get things right enough to get through the chapter is the intended experience, and ties into the overall themes of the narrative, but if you're the type who absolutely despises losing due to bad rolls, there are multiple options for you. Aside from the brutal rng-based "original" mode, there's an easier "light" mode which tones down the cruelty a bit. If you can't stand rng at all, there is also a "puzzle" mode which ditches rng and revises the scenarios so that the right strategy wins every time. Even beyond that, there is a "narrative" mode that ditches most of the challenge entirely so you can just see the story.\n\nWhile I fully approve of a game offering a choice of ways to experience it, the original mode does make the most sense when it comes to the overall story it's telling, creating a feeling of controlled helplessness as you pray to the random number gods that things work out this time. The story itself is about as bleak as things get, ramming home an overarching theme of nihilism and the insignificance of the individual on a cosmic level, but twists and turns along the way make for near-infinite replayability. It's very enjoyable to unravel, even if the storytelling can be a little confusing at times.\n\nOverall, while it may be too frustrating in its original intended form for some, and way too damn bleak for others, Gods Will Be Watching is a twisted, unique indie gem that will disturb and provoke if you give it the chance.\n\n","June 2","true","17.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

To be fair, there should be a disclaimer: This game is built to make the player fail. You will fail. Repeatedly. Sometimes simply because RNG decides it so.\n\nIf that turns you away, then don't purchase this game. You are offered little to no direct instructions other than how to select commands, and you are presented with, at most, hints from other characters about how to proceed. The rest is completely up to you to figure out. And when you finally "get it", it will often be too late as half your party is either dead or about to die and the game over is seconds away. But every time you fail and restart (which, by the way, is incredibly smooth, putting you right back into the action by skipping any unneeded dialogue), you push forward with your newly found knowledge to beat the level. It could be as simple as memorizing the visual cues or realizing a pattern to how events sequence out. And it's not like you don't know what killed you. It is often extremely clear (I failed a chapter 1 minute in because I failed to light the campfire for the night, freezing everyone to death, with an accompanying message reminding me what I'm dumb). All this adds up to a "Eureka!" moment, when you finally get your own routine down to beat the level, where you understand how to keep that constantly rebelling hostage from attacking, and you are certain you can win.\n\n\n\n\n...And then you fail an action that has an 80% chance of success, giving you a game over.\n\nIt's all very reminiscent of the difficulty of retro games, where the only way to succeed is by dying to the traps that you can't possibly avoid without already knowing they are there.\n\nIt does what a "choose your adventure" point and click like The Walking Dead series was supposed to do: Your moral choices aren't simply governed by how much you like a character (Let's be real, every "save this character" choice in TWD was ultimately inconsequential if you survived or not), but by the fact that choosing to be benevolent can doom your entire group. Knowing you are one unlucky dice roll away from death certainly skews most people's moral compass.\n\nIn multiple chapters you are presented with a survival challenge: Keep everyone in your group well-rested, fed, and happy, otherwise there will be deaths. Easy enough, right? So when oxygen is running out and the only way to survive is by getting passwords from your hostages who refuse to talk, do you beat their kid and threaten to blast his head off to break his mother into telling, or do you let him free to earn the trust of your captives? Or what about when your hunter is unable to come up with food for the day, and you have to choose between feeding your party's doctor or another member who offers purely moral support? Do you let the doctor go hungry and risk him dying/deserting, leaving your party without medical aid, or do you feed him and let someone else starve to death? Suddenly, moral choices become much more impactful.\n\nFor me, the combination of "You can't save everyone" with RNG elements and vague mechanics makes the game much more immersive than your standard survival game. You aren't given clear instructions, consequences need to be learned (the hard way), and often times you don't even know what the win state is.\n\nWhich brings me to chapter 2.  Everyone is whinging about it, so if you read the reviews you'll probably know a little about it.  It's a torture chapter, where you need to endure (what you are told to be) 20 days of torture. And in the middle of it you have to play a literal, unbiased, beautifully cruel game of Russian roulette. Every time you choose to not answer a question, the guy aims the revolver loaded with one bullet at you, and the only thing keeping you alive is merciless Lady Luck herself. This segment of the chapter is fantastic because you have to plan around it. You are given a little bit of leeway, every time you are close to the brink of death you can tell your torturers a little bit about the truth so they give you a break. Give them too much though, and you fail anyway. So you can either use those confessions to make the rest of the sequence easier, hoping for good luck on the roulette, or you can save your confessions to basically bypass the roulette sequence. And when it comes down to it, the feeling of complete hopelessness you get when you're waiting for that click of the empty chamber is amazing.\n\nAll in all, this is an amazing game. The minimalistic graphics are awesome, the soundtrack is superb, the story is a little cheesy, yeah, but still enjoyable. If you are patient and aren't turned off by the fact you can fail simply because the game said ♥♥♥♥ you, pick this game up. Definitely worth at least a try.\n\n","October 24, 2014","true","8.4"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

The original idea of this game came from the 26th Ludum Dare based on Minimalism.\n\nPlot\nThe writing on this game, in my opinion, is lacking. The whole was through was a confusing mess. No matter who was killed one chapter, the game threw them back into the next chapter with little to no explaination with only the ending giving  any  clarity. What the game does have going for it is the down to earth sections. The "lore" behind it was well planned and thought out, but it never did make up for the confusion of the story. It just seemed like average sci-fi story with a twisted dark side to it.\n\nGameplay\nThis is mainly where the flesh of the game is tainted. The game is broken up into 7 chapters. Each chapter is very different to the next, each one introducing a lot of new ideas and something you definitely haven't done before. It's exciting and fresh. Except when you have to redo it  OVER AND OVER  again. This game is built around the idea of trial and error. So you will screw up. A lot. And this is where issues began. The chapters were mainly built on managing work and items. Who does what and what do we do with these items. Various chapters splash in specks of random. This is where the gameplay falls apart. You'll end up replaying chapters over and over again, failing each time to this random element. Frustrating gameplay doesn't equal having fun.\n\nGraphics\nDevolver Digital has done it again! Made a visually appealing game out of something my SNES could run! Congratulations! But all jokes aside, this game is a looker. The different colors blend the pixels in well, and with each death lying there from my hands made my stomach churn with how it blended in well! The art team did a great job on this one.\n\nSound\nThe plinks and plonks of this game can really immerse you into the science fiction story. Each action seemed to be complimented with a gratifying audio sound. The music is easily compared to that of FTL, but less fast paced. It was lacking that sense of urgency on certain missions, but none the less blended in well.\n\nGenre\nDid this game fit in well with it's genre. Yes and no. Yes to the point and click adventure, and no to the moral choice gameplay. It is a dark game full of dark awful people, but aren't well all disgusting people? Well, no game. We are not. The game tends to put you into these hard choice moments,  BUT NONE OF THEM EVEN MATTER !\nSlight spoiler alert for this bit so tread lightly!\n[spolier] Death in this game is parshily pointless! Whenever a character dies, they just get up and brush it off to appear in the next chapter! I shot and killed my engineer in the group, just to have him aboard my ship after being rescued without him! [/spoiler]\n\nBreakdown\n\n1.) Did I have fun? Yes. I had fun in a dark sense, but I was also frustrated and felt as though I wasted time.\n2.) Is the money worth the length? $10 or Euro/Pound equvilant for about 8 hours of gameplay... (Unless you're like me and always get screwed in a certain chapter of the game for four hours)\n\nOverall  Gods Will Be Watching is a game that is worth a watch on YouTube, but is a  no buy.\n\n","July 27, 2014","false","10.6"," 9 of 16 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","9","16","0","0"

It's supposed to be a game about talking your way through tense, high stakes, dramatic scenarios by reading the characters' behaviors to gain the upper hand. It almost get, too. The problem is that the actions you take will do different things each time you play. Outcomes rely too much on hidden dice rolls for the punishing checkpoints to be bearable.\n\nSome situations are explicitly RNG based. The game will even tell you "you have a 1 in X chance of failing this". If you do fail, you have to start the chapter over again (losing 10-20 minutes of progress). Other situations are balancing acts, where you essentially have to keep between 1 and 4 meters from getting too high or too low. Unfortunately, the actions that you choose from will impact each meter different amounts and in different directions each time you do them. Doing action X might lower all of the meters a little bit the first time, but the second time it might make one meter spike up and another meter dramatically fall.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/scribblerdee/recommended/274290/","scribblerdee","nop","http://steamcommunity.com/id/scribblerdee/","267 products in account","Gods Will Be Watching is an interesting concept for an adventure game marred heavily by some really dumb design decisions.\nThe premise is you are Sgt. Burden (no ♥♥♥♥), leader of men in a bleak far future where you have to make tough utilitarian choices to survive. Beyond this interesting idea though there isn't a whole lot worth paying for.\n\nThe game is too difficult in the most ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t of manners. At the outset you have a choice between "easy" or "original" difficulties, with original being devoid of any hints or help and said to be how the devs want you to play. I chose original because I enjoy challenging games, but this is another level. For a game that consists of fairly long scenarios where you are sent back to the start if you die, far too many outcomes are based on chance. For example, the 2nd scenario you have to survive torture for several days and one method used on you is Russian Roulette. I had gotten to this part before, had a plan and went to execute it, however on my second turn I got my head blown off because there was a 1 in 6 chance of it happenening. At this point I looked to the sky and said "Thank you Jesus for bestowing me with these hard-hitting, quality independently developed games". This wouldn't be such a big deal if it wasn't for the fact you have to run through scenarios several times till you know what is happening.\n\nThe torture scenario, again, I had to play several times till I eventually had no choice but to write down the order torture methods were used in order to succeed. It was actually clever and there was logic to it but it didn't become apparent until over an hour or so of experimenting and dealing with ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t RNG deaths, which made the cleverness substantially less impressive. The manner in which you have to repeat these scenarios is also detrimental to the game's core theme. Any tension that exists as part of making these choices is dulled by frustration and rigmorale. You get to a point where you don't give a ♥♥♥♥ how many puppies you have to kick, you just want to see the next screen. Considering this was "playing the game the way the developer intended", I wonder if they played it themselves because it is not enjoyable.\n\nIn general the game could use more polish. There's plenty of typos and graphical errors like sprites shooting 180 degrees behind them without turning around. Speaking of graphics, the backgrounds look great but the character sprites and animations could use more effort. In a game where caring about the characters is a big deal, maybe giving them actual faces would have helped. This could be more of a personal gripe though because I think games that do this (Superbrothers etc.) are downright ♥♥♥♥ing lazy. All that time spent on background and yet no one could be bothered to draw just two dots and a line on some faces. Some people will say this is "minimalism" as the game was a Ludum Dare game with that very theme, but you could ask someone to make a Ludum Dare game about cheeses at this point and they will just make whatever the ♥♥♥♥ they want and relate it back somehow.\n\nOverall, super disappointing. Do not buy for less than five bucks.\n\nEDIT: I do have to give this game credit though for having consequences that carry over between scenarios and actually have an impact on your situation. In that sense it's better than what Telltale has been doing. Just a shame it's so damn frustrating.","July 24, 2014","false","4.2"," 12 of 22 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","12","22","0","0"

THIS REVIEW IS (SADLY !!!!) LEGIT :-(\n\nAND IT SEEMS ROCKPAPERSHOTGUN CERTAINLY AGREES WITH MY REVIEW WHICH THEY POSTED SOME HOURS AFTER I DID. I HAVE ADDED THEIR POINT AT THE END OF MINE AND THEY HAVE COME TO ALL THE SAME CONCLUSIONS! .. So suck it, downvoters!\n\nHi devs or fans of this game. Been looking forward to the release of this game for about 5 months, since i first heard about it. And Devolver, one of my favorite publishers are publishing it? Great right..\n\nExcept I'm gutted..\n\nFirst of all. This game is much less about decision than it is micro management and grinding..\n\nI thought this was a meaningful experience that challenged your morals but instead, i found a grinding game that was incredibly hard to progress in. Stuck in the first level for almost an hour (I've played through 5 levels now) because it was seemingly impossible to beat it, so I had to go through the shame of playing it on easy, only to find that there were seamingly no meaningful choices at my disposal, while still being difficult... (And I play Hitman Absolution on second highest difficulty. And I loved all three of the Souls games, so I'm not a newbie gamer who only plays shooters or something like that. )\n\nThis game is nothing like what was advertised, at least not to me, and I'm absolutely gutted. I chose to preorder this game, first game i've ever pre-ordered because I don't believe in the practice, and now I'm sure I'll never do so again...\n\nAll this is a shame as the sprites a beautiful and the game is generally pretty with some nice environments in the different levels (that get repeated near the end). Writing is passable and the soundtrack is pretty decent. It's not Hotline Miami (One of my favorite experiences and favorite soundtracks)\n\n\nSorry, but I just can't justify having bought this game at all and I doubt I'll be spending more time with it.. After waiting all day for it to be able to install, i'm incredibly dissappointed.\n\n\n(RPS REVIEW POINT: It’s beautiful, no doubt. The pixel art is wonderful, and the soundtrack is splendid. Looking at just the screenshots, I’d be reaching for my wallet. But the core game is just so tedious. By the fifth chapter, you’re literally wandering through near-identical scenes of desert, and at this point I’m honestly wondering if maybe this is the point? Maybe it’s some arch commentary on gaming, on our repeating tasks because we’re told to, for meaningless rewards? There’s certainly enough meta-stuff going on along the way to imply this is where it’s heading, but dear me, if so, then the smugness would burst the walls. I really cannot find the will to keep putting myself through it to find out if the point was how much I’m wasting my time putting myself through it. During my fifth go the game announced it was out of memory, and closed itself, and yeah, that will do.\n\nI’m really gutted about this. I’ve been interested in the project since the first screenshots, and there’s unquestionably a huge amount of potential for someone to try to combine long-term survival with resource management in this form. But this is a tiresomely repetitive affair, and snarky with it. Perhaps the big reveal that lies at the end would astonish me, but there’s been nothing to earn the persistence I already put in, let alone any more. Let the gods judge me for that.)","July 24, 2014","false","1.1"," 75 of 146 people (51%) found this review helpful","51","75","146","0","21"

This is not a game about tough choices, this is an extremely difficult, tedious and simply frustrating micro-management game!\n\nI was looking forward to his game. Actually so much that I've backed it on indiegogo. I like games with dark storylines that force me to make tough choices and sacrifices. And while the game succeeds in areas like aesthetics - the minimalist pixel art is fantastic - and sound, the gameplay is anything but about tough choices. It's a game about monotonous micro-management.\n\nAgain, I think the trailers and the description are both misleading and as a result, this game is going to surprise people that didn't play the original flash game. (Which was similar but undoubtedly better) You're not presented with difficult moral choices but a couple of things you have to micro-manage in parallel in order to progress while being fed small amounts of story.\n\nAnd the difficulty is legendary. "Original" mode is for people that want to fall into a coma and/or have fever dreams. On easy, I was able to handle the game so far but it's still a chore and extremely tedious. As of yet, I can't say if I even want to continue playing this.\n\nSome people were claiming that this game is incredibly rewarding if you stick with it. I absolutely disagree. My reactions when I finished Chapter 1 and 2 were "Ugh. F- this. I'm glad this is over". I wasn't satisfied and it didn't feel rewarding at all.\n\nThe third redeeming quality besides the fantastic art-style and the amazing soundtrack is the plot. The premise really resonates with me and I'd love to know how everything pans out... but the gameplay might prevent me from finding out.\n\n\nIt may sound like it but I'm not saying this is a bad game. The only bad thing is that there was some massive miscommunication between the devs and their audience. What they presented as buildup in forms of trailers etc. absolutely not represent what this game actually is.\n\nAs a result I can't recommend this game.\n\nBottom line:An incredibly difficult, tedious micro-management game with an interesting plot and pleasing aesthetics.

What interesting moral dilemmas the player might face are rendered insignificant by gameplay mechanics that rely too hard on percent chance and the "Game Over, try again?" screen. The extreme difficulty and lengthy dialogue clash awkwardly: You'll have to repeat "levels" over and over again, meaning you'll have to read the same dialogue over and over again. This repetition lessens whatever effect the situations may have on you, and forces you to focus instead on micromanaging character statuses. This undermines the moral dilemmas the game tries to put the player in, forcing them to rewatch the same grisly violence over and over again and rendering its effect meaningless.\n\nFor a game that relies so heavily on character statuses, it does a poor job of informing the player of those statuses. Art can be vague, and characters don't react consistently. This would be fine if the game's failstates didn't rely so heavily on the actions of these characters.\n\nNot fun. Not effective.

The original flash game was an amazing mood piece. The unforgiving gameplay drove it. The dialogue was terse, the options few and you'd learn immediately the odds as you died over and over again. The point of the demo was not winning (there was barely any reward screen), but to instill in the player that dread of being barely alive and see your options dwindling, your mates losing their mind and hope slowly evaporate. Great stuff.\n\nThis sequel flips the concept disastrously on its head. The gameplay is just as unforgiving and random based, but you are required to win if you want to make sense of the plot. Besides being frustrating, it is extremely gimmicky. Oh really, the sarge gets locked in a room again for the fourth time? And as you repeat the chapter for the nth time you start to wonder. Why wouldn't the terrorist tie up the hostages? Why would a torturer ever put a live round in the revolver? Why can't the group multitask?\nThe link between the narrative and the underlying puzzle is so weak and feels so forced. It was okay in the demo because mood was god, but here it just doesn't work.\n\nAnd the writing isn't very good either. Forget the typos.\nYou can't have a very tense torture scene and end it with the torturer saying "I had too many jalapeno". Really? A poop joke? Why not a benny hill music to go with it?\nYou can't have an undercover spy start its trasmissions by reporting its real name, its rank, its location and its mission. That's just poor espionage. That's  just you screaming at me "exposition tiiime".\nYou can't postpone explaining so much of the plot in a game where obstacles are so frustating. Why people come back to life? Why am I seeing ghosts? Why should I care if you keep not explaining it to me?\nYou can't have so few dialogues in a game whose sections you know will have to be repeated again and again.\n\nJust skip it","July 26, 2014","false","6.6"," 14 of 26 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","14","26","0","0"

It seemed challenging and it does have an interesting story with some neat and amusing characters so I thought for the price it might be a decent pick up to tide myself over for some big name releases.\n\nUpon playing I found that there are only sound options, and nothing for windowed mode; how I tend to plamost if not ALL of y PC games. So I went into the directory to see if there were any files that might allow me to fix this.\n\nAnd low and behold, I find something astounding; Every chapter has its own seperate folder out in the open with all the data it relies on completely present and, get this, editable by the user. I don't know much, heck, I don't know ANYTHING about programming but I can recognize numbers and quantities when I see them.\n\nYou see, each folder has a 'control' file, for instance chapter 3's is labeled 'p3_control'. Go into this file and you can edit various factors about the mission. In doing so I could make any mission so hilariously easy it doesn't warrant the challenge. Now, this isn't me saying that this how you beat the game.\nBut this is incredibly exploitable and easy to do.\n\nSo why am I saying this in a review? Because I wanted it to be known that trial and error can be fun, and in games like Dark Souls and Monster Hunter learning how to handle situations is exciting. In this game you sit and try again and again as what worked once seemingly fails to consistently get the same results.

I am not new to games that require multiple tries and may cause frustration (I'm looking at you, Binding of Isaac, Papers Please). I am not new to games that try to teach you things through long trial and error and difficult decisions (Always Sometimes Monsters, anyone?). I really looked forward to this game as an awesome mesh of possibilities, going down many different paths to many different endings, all based on your moral standing.\n\nThat is, sadly, not what I got. Maybe it's just me, but I could not get into the moral portion of this game. For one thing, your decisions don't seem to offer you much of a moral choice. There's not many "right answers", or so it feels, and its hard to get through the game without playing a specific way. I probably haven't explored the game enough, but the other thing is, there's nothing that makes me really want to. Sure the dark humor is great, and sure the characters are pretty memorable, but they're also kind of...bland. Not really as deep as I had hoped.\n\nAnd the gameplaay itself. Not the path traveling and searching I had hoped for. More of a trial and error (as above descibed) micromanagement game, which is not bad in and of itself, but really disappointed me. The micromanagement is annoying as heck to get around, and usually requires a few trial and error. The game ends up being very dedication-based; as long as you keep hitting it with your forehead, you'll get to the end, and never mind how many bodies and limbs you have to leave in your path.\n\nEvery game I've got, even the ones I ended up not playing very much, even the ones I can't run on my computer because I don't have the graphics card (♥♥♥♥ you, Mortal Kombat), have left me with some sort of satisfaction or resolution. A sort of resignation, even, but at least a satisfied close. Maybe I'm a shopaholic on Steam, but anyways, this game just didn't do it for me. I was left staring at it, wanting something...tangible, damn it.

You're constantly racing against a turn-based clock and every move is crucial and needs to be carefully considered.\n\nI just love the moody atmosphere.

In all honesty, this game has a lot that has it going for it such as its story, art and uniqueness as a game. The story was pretty interesting, where you play as Sgt. Burden working to save the world. The pixel art style was a very nice touch to the game, I couldn't think of an art style more fitting for GWBW. Lastly making decisions that could ultimately make you die or survive keep the game quite fun. Nonetheless, like most games, it has its flaws. The lack of a quicksave option is one. Another is the replayability because you play GWBW for its story and/or gameplay.\n\nPros:\n- nice pixel art style\n- interesting story\n- unique gameplay\n- has a nice pace, the story isn't too long or short\n- the game is overall well made\n- no bugs (for me)\n\nCons:\n- no quicksave\n- cannot be replayable (atleast to me)\n- minor things such as characters sometimes placed too close to each other.\n\nDefinitely a must play!\nI'd give it a 8/10","December 25, 2014","true","9.0"," 1 person found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","0","1","1","2","0"

Burden has the tough job of not only getting himself, but those under his care through the situations by any and every means possible.  The game is divided into 7 chapters, each with it's own dillemma, resources, and time restraints that will challenge you, make you take notes, and question to what lengths you will go to complete the chapter.  For instance, in Chapter 1 you are responcible for maintaining hostages while your team retrieves data.  If one breaks and runs away, do you shoot the unarmed civillian increasing the chances the remainder revolts and attacks you, or do you let them run to saftey, and making the others not percieve you as a threat? Either are options, and there are no morals that you are judged by in game.  After each chapter, a Statistics screen shows your results compared to the community's.\n\nThe game is ment to be difficult, as the rules of each chapter are not always clearly presented.  There are also no mid-chapter saves, as the intention is for you to learn by trial and error.  I would recommend the "Original Light" difficulty for your first run through, and be aware there is a "Chapter Selection" feature if you would like to change the difficulty and play any reached chapter, allowing you to change difficulty on the fly if needed.\n\nIf you want a strangely intriguing plot, learning by trial and error, and bizzare survival scenarios, Gods Will Be Watching is worth the price of admission.\nIf you want a straight forward plot, clearly explained rules, and consistant experiance, you may want to look elsewhere.

I like the retro art style, the music is good and the adult themes are very much up my alley. The story seems to be somewhat compelling also. Unfortunately this is all overshadowed by extremely frustrating gameplay. There is a very narrow margin for error for your decisions if you want to complete a scenario. Some visual cues provide hints as to how best to proceed but other factors are completely unknown and will require you to fail the scenario dozens of times before you figure out how they play into the equation. There is also a percentage based system on certain actions which may cause you to fail a scenario for no other reason that bad luck. This may force you to repeat a long drawn out sequence from the very beginning which is rather tedious and frustrating when it happens multiple times.

I rarely buy games that get below a 70% rating with either of these reviewers.  That being said, I bought this game despite the 64/100 on metacritic, I played it not knowing what to expect, and thankfully, I really enjoyed it.\n\nAs many of the other reviewers will tell you, this game is not for everyone.  I purchased it because I loved Hotline Miami and seeing the previews for this game I was drawn to the brutal violence and artistic style.  It's a very challanging game, and it forces you to pick up on little trends and nuances during the gameplay if you want to win.\n\nTo explain further, this game requires patience. Just as you start getting really mad because you're getting your tail handed to you, you realize that something you're failing in isn't just RNG, it's something you just haven't been paying attention to.  Sure there are parts that are randomized (which you can disable if you want), but the changing factors with each restart keep you on your toes.\n\nThe story is interesting enough to follow and it actually kind of makes you look at the way you play ruthless games such as this one that force you to die or fail over and over again in order to discover a solution.  Things you do will make you feel bad, they'll make you feel like you could have done more, and they certainly make you feel helpless.\n\nBottom line, you feel like you're in a Cormac McCarthy novel.

You make decisions with time always-dwindling, but in a turn-based way so that each decision is the product of how much you thought about it, which is good because you never have to make a snap decision, but it also means each outcome is the fault of your planning alone. For fans of games like Telltale's The Walking Dead and The Wolf Among Us, GWBW similarly shows how your decisions compare to other players'.\n\nWhat makes it really interesting is that each chapter (of which there are seven) uses completely different choice mechanics, although they use the same interface. All have an element of time running out, but beyond that, the choices you must evaluate differ entirely. You might have to manage your crew's morale in one chapter, or just keep them well-rested in another. Each of these sections almost feels like they're in completely different genres, despite sharing similar decision systems; I wonder if they were designed by different people. At least one of the sections plays kind of like a roguelike, and another like a long quicktime event.\n\nThe music and art are also fantastic and memorable, and I regret not buying the soundtrack DLC, but at least you can get .OGGs of the music in the game files. The plot is also interesting enough, but for me, the gameplay system is what stuck with me.","November 18, 2014","true","9.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

While its story is rather short (If you manage to perfectly run the game it would take 2 hours max) I still thought that the message behind it is rather excellent. You play as Sgt. Burden, and you spend your time as a member of E.D.U.K trying to stop Xenolifer and there plot to release a virus upon an innocent world. This sounds like it would be the grounds for an action packed, teeth gritting, and emotional ride. It is, just not in the sense you would imagine it. The first mission puts you in charge of a hostage situtation about to go wrong, while you micromanage hostages, your hacking progress and security, the guards inching closer and closer down the hall, and most importantly, your ethics. These situations are designed in a way that is brutally unforgiving, one that is designed to make sure you dont make it out of anything scot free. Do you really want to shoot a hostage and spray his brains all over his co-workers? If you dont, his friends may get to complacent and attempt to fight back, and his life will be as good as over anyway. Fear, compassion, brutality, calculation, all worked into a formula of sort to keep the hostages complacent. Then add 2 other things you have to keep an eye on in the form of a rescue team and the security of your hacking connection, and you'll find a situation getting more and more out of hand. You cant just scold and embrace people over and over, and you cant just shoot everyone in the head, you have to find a middle. However, the game is designed to throw so much stuff in your path, you will never find it. Thats the thing here, there is no perfection, sacrifice will either be of your choice, or the games. It will kill your friends, and you will watch and get frustrated, however the deeper narritive at play here will be something most indie titles lack. Im delving into spoiler territory here, but the final 2 missions are when this becomes most apparent. Everytime you lose, everytime you die, Burden does too. He gets frustrated with you, he knows what attacks Liam is going to throw and physically tells him much to his suprise. He is living the same hell you are, and thats when you find yourself thinking. Many people never gave the game enough chance to find this deeper narritive, and many don't care either way, but for people like me interested in the human psyche I cant stress enough how this game sticks with you. It deserves the time of day, just dont come to me if you punch through a monitor in rage.","September 23, 2014","true","4.5"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

I didn't mind playing the same sequence over and over but I can see how it could get very boring very fast. It's not engaging but it is engrossing. I spent a lot of time in a later chapter intentionally losing the game to see different permutations of the failstates and death animations and stuff. I imagine I'll eventually shoot to get all the achievements when I want a slightly mind-numbing activity.\n\nStory is great on a surface level and even more awesome if you like brainfood type videogame stories and take pleasure in thinking about the who what why and how. But it doesn't push the pretentious indie brainfood at all, you can just enjoy it as a story about a dude in space and be entertained.\n\nAlso the music and graphics are amazing and veeery mood-setting.\n\nOne weird complaint I have is that I couldn't upgrade to the collector's edition without rebuying the base game (so I didn't buy it at all :C) but that's a steam thing not a game thing.","December 8, 2014","true","11.5"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

This game has some great visuals, but it doesn't redeem the amount of frustration you'll experience in the "gameplay", the trailer is misleading which is unforgiveable and I feel burned because of it, but I actually feel even more burned over the fact that I wasted 8 hours on this with the hope that it'd get better than over the money I spent on it.\n\nThe first level was okay, but after that the 'gameplay' relies too much RNG, not in the good way Darkest Dungeon implemented it either (where adequate preparation can soften the impact of the RNG, as well as the fact that Darkest Dungeon seems fair in it's own morbid way because the enemy can get ♥♥♥♥ed over by RNG just as much as you can), and unlike Darkest Dungeon the RNG here doesn't add to the replay value, after you finish a scenario here all you remember is what a painful experience you had to endure... and in Gods Will Be Watching the RNG is on the forefront, and often the deciding factor on winning a scenario is pure luck. You'll also get a lot of scenarios here that require you to gamble with an 85% chance of losing the gamble, and if you lose a scenario you lose 30-45 minutes of progress.\n\nOverall, you feel like you're in a RNG casino, and instead of playing with money you're playing with time that you can be using to play something better with more depth to the gameplay. GwbW left such an awful taste in my mouth that it's hard playing anything where you see characters from a sideview with pixelated graphics.\n\nDon't buy it, not even if it comes on sale.","April 20, 2015","false","8.0"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","4","7","0","0"

This is not pixel art interactive fiction or a straight adventure game where any number of choices will all allow the player to proceed to discover the effects of their choices.\n\nInstead, the closest analogy that I can draw is to a brutally difficult Choose Your Own Adventure book. Each chapter requires a lot of trial and error to suss out the background mechanics to the point where I quickly lost immersion in the game and reverted to metagaming analysis in order to plan a series of actions in order to proceed. The narrative impact of dialogue quickly loses its potency after the second or third loop.\n\nThe impact of random chance in the 5th chapter is especially egregious and there are some notable lapses in game logic. Starting a camp fire by using your pistol to shoot a log or adding an already collected log costs an action equivilent to a hunting expedition or collecting firewood.\n\nIn the torture/interrogation sequence, the characters apparently cannot think of lies when not actively being tortured (a more logical route would have been for the game to give a single substantial boost (maybe even to 100%) to the credibility of your lie if the question being asked in a subsequent session is the same as the quetion being asked during the previous day.\n\nFinally, the background of the setting isn't explained quite well enough to make the context of the game clear in parts.","August 2, 2014","false","15.9"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/feuerzeuge/recommended/274290/","feuerzeuge","fleur","http://steamcommunity.com/id/feuerzeuge/","211 products in account","I found this game to be intriguing and rewarding, and definitely worth its price. The gameplay mechanics are primarily figuring out how to ideally manage scarce resources (there are no typical point-and-click adventure puzzles to speak of), and the story is integrated wonderfully with these mechanics; it was enough to draw me in and keep me going when the game had very nearly pushed me beyond the edge of despair, and the themes in the narrative often influenced my gameplay decisions. Likewise, my own experience mirrored the protagonist's closely enough that I found myself identifying with him easily, and when I finally triumphed against all odds I felt pretty good about myself.\n\nThe game requires quite a bit of trial and error - almost no mechanics are explained, and you are almost guaranteed to fail repeatedly. If you're easily discouraged, I would advise you to avoid this. I played this on Original difficulty, so I can't speak towards the experience on easy mode. My biggest gripe with this game is the fifth chapter: unlike every other chapter, it incorporates a big element of luck which compounds the difficulty and renders it into an exercise in frustration. It was enough to nearly make me stop playing, since the RNG could doom you from very early on and it's long enough to make restarting from the beginning (which you WILL do more than once) a giant pain in the ♥♥♥. There is also a memory leak present in that chapter at the time of writing, which really doesn't really help.\n\nBeyond that and an abundance of small typos, I can't really fault the game. It was interesting, it looks nice, and I was entirely distracted from the pointlessness of my life for the period of time that I was playing it. Would recommend, 8/10.","July 28, 2014","true","13.0"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","1"

Burden (wink wink) who will have to decide on how to survive 6 dangerous scenarios. The gameplay is entirely micromanagement: you have a group of factors that need attention, and only so much time/actions/resources you can have to use to prevent things from spiraling out of control. On top of which lies a factor of chance, as actions are accompanied with varying levels of benefits with a chance of failure. It has a dark tone and is repetitive, and the gameplay forces you to make some ethical decisions if you fail to make the most flawless ones. The repetition works very well to project a feeling of the monotony and struggle of surviving without resources. It is similar to “Papers Please” in style and in that they both are repetitive, dark, and have morale choices; but its primary difference is while "Papers Please" evolves in difficulty, the micromanagement completely changes in the levels of "Gods Will Be Watching".\n\nThe visuals are an abstract form of pixel, and everything is iconic, which allows the player to imagine how characters look in terms of detailing, which inherently creates a greater investment of emotions tied to each character. The music is repetitive and consistent, and it works in great effect especially as the gameplay deals a lot with straining time and resources, giving a sense of struggle and inevitable doom.\n\nThe biggest flaw of the game is the writing. It is not poor but it’s not great, especially the conversations held by the characters feel like they are all the same person. No one in this game has a unique personality, in fact many of the characters have the same dialogue lines when interacting with them. The uniqueness each character receives is from their appearance and their abilities alone, you simply could not tell the characters apart without describing their occupation, look, and purpose. For example, at the beginning of the game, Sgt. Burden holds four people hostage, and when you want to calm them down, he says a line about how their crying reminds him of his dear sister; which makes sense when he talks to the female hostage but it doesn't make sense when he is talking to the fat bloke. Some of the scenes just don’t make sense, and I will continue if you don’t mind the spoiler. If you do mind just take my word and blink over my example.\n\n–SPOILER BEINGS-\nThe E.C.U.K. has been tracking the leader of the Xenolifer, Liam for a while now and has demanded that Sgt. Burden kill him due to his maniacal hijacking of a super weapon (the virus) which Sgt. Burden helped him get in the first place. Sgt Burden, being the idealist he is, vehemently disagrees stating that this act will make Liam a martyr and spark a war, which shows how smart Sgt. Burden is for helping him get the weapon of mass destruction in the first place, and how much he knows about making good choices for the greater good. The E.C.U.K. declares that he is bound by his obligations and in not killing Liam soon that he will become a traitor, later Burden gets caught and tortured and days later is finally saved by the E.C.U.K. who then decides to take him back anyway after branding him a traitor. Furthermore they fail to recognize the leader, Liam lying a few feet away from Burden, which would be tantamount to a US soldier in the Middle East failing to recognize Bin Laden in 2008.\n-SPOILER ENDS-\n\nOn original difficulty this game is actually very difficult, with many hidden parameters that you will not understand without playing the scenario a few times around. While the difficulty is not a bad thing, the frequency of hidden parameters demonstrating the game’s lack of instruction and intuition is more detrimental than creative. For example, in the beginning part of the game you can shoot the guards and the hostages will panic, this is a good use of intuitive and creative gameplay. After apologizing to Jack, and having Jack lose the ability to shoot the guards is a demonstration of detrimental lack of information, which I found would force me to restart.\nDespite these flaws, I felt a strong sense of will in trying to beat Day 2, which led me to staying up till 5 AM. I must really feel an investment to the game if I am willing to go to such lengths in playing it in both plot and gameplay. I would recommend it to people who like plot driven gameplay, as well as gamers who are comfortable playing more abstract indie games similar to “Papers Please”.\n","May 10, 2015","true","9.0"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","3"

The game has 7 difficulty levels and even on the lowest difficulty it will raep your ašš, seriously. I don't mind difficult games at all since I really enjoyed playing games like Hotline Miami 1 and 2, Super Meat Boy and Dark Souls, but this game is only difficult because of its RNG factor, It's unbelievably frustrating. When you fail the level you need to play it all over from the start and fast forward all the dialogues, it's annoying as hell. To me this game felt like watching a sexy Kate Upton video at first when I started playing it, right, but the more I played the game the more it looked like Kate started eating poo in that video and it all turned into a 2 girls 1 cup video with Kate Upton.

Rather than a point & click adventure, it plays as more a time & resource management simulator crossed with a puzzle game alongside a running narrative. This means that while there's only really 6 puzzles to solve in the entire game each one will take you upwards of 2-3 hours to solve (on normal difficulty).\n\nThe game is rather difficult, but mostly fair. The reason it gets a lot of poor user reviews is that there's no solid 'solution' to each puzzle as each level has various RNG elements. This means you have to judge each playthrough by yourself rather than following along a gamefaq. Seemingly a lot of people can't deal with that, so they added in a mode which eliminates the RNG factor completely (but also diminishes the actual game part).\n\nThe presentation & soundtrack are fantastic, though there are several grammatical & spelling issues which I presume is due to it being made by a latino team (as the credits seem to be in Spanish or Portugese). The story while interesting takes a bit of a bizarre, philosophical almost mystical turn near the end. In my opinion, it doesn't answer a lot of questions thrown up earlier in the game & it would have been more fun if the protagonist Sgt. Burden was just a soilder with a talent for surviving the impossible rather than a hinted at deity type figure.\n\nThis criticism aside, it's a very unique game, I enjoyed my time with it & providing you're not expecting a genre of game that it isn't trying to be.

They are meant to be retro, this is good people!! the backing tracks are epic and will have you turn up the sound as you play this difficult (but by no means dark souls esque) as you try and try to save everyone and then decend into just trying to complete your objective at all costs.\n\nYou play Sergeant Burden a man who is resolute in his beliefs and weary of them at the same time. Undercover for months inflitrating a terrorist organisation that is trying to free people from galactic slavery.\nAs the story progresses the lines of morality are blurred until you are not sure who is right, or why it matters at all.\n\nSo for the gameplay, each scenario is pretty much stand alone but links the story together. In each there is an overarching objective to accomplish but with harsh contraints that mean you can't have your cake and eat it. Things will go wrong and its about learning what works and what doesn't (though there are multiple solutions). You have to manage the people under you and try (or not try) to get them out alive.\n\nOnce you learn that the game is not going to give you the win on a plate it makes it easier decide to take crazy actions from the start , that help you in the end!. It makes  for good play with a partner deciding what to do next, and dealing with the frustrations together.\n\nThere is about 6 chapters to get through, so it could be short if you are really good but the experience is worth it and hope these developers get more credit for a unique and stellar game experience.\n","August 6, 2014","true","18.0"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

It was just a short suvival webgame, where you had to manage a small group of survivers on a fire. When I first saw this game, my first thought was "hey, I already played that for free many month ago!"\n\nBut then I bought this game when it was on sale. This game is much more then the demo. It has 6 different chapters, each unique. You always have to make decissions and manage your resources to survive or reach a certain goal in a set time. It is not real time, but turn based. So for example, you got like 25 days to reach a goal. You need to care for your crewmembers health and morale and you need to handle random events.\n\nAnd its all in this cool old adventure look :)\n\nI really love this game. It can be really challanging sometimes and it is hard to keep everyone alive. You often have to leave someone behind. I just reached chapter 5 by now.\n\nEach chapter is very different, so its not just the same mechanism just with 6 different backgrounds. Each chapter has unique mechanisms, dangers and ways to play it. In one chapter, you are just around a fire and need to keep everyone alive and the fire runing, and you need to care about their health. In another chapter, you are in a desert with a big team and need to care for water and ammunition, while moving around the desert.\n\nI'm very curious how all this ends.

It's a narratively-driven resource/risk management game with a text interface. But the gameplay isn't the most interesting part of it. It has a pretty enigmatic story that's heavy at first, everything is kinda confusing and doesn't seem to make much sense (like a character dying, but then still talking in cutscenes)... but if you keep going, everything clears up. It's meta, but not like "The Stanley Parable" is. It doesn't feel stale, already-explored, or cliché.\n\nThe presentation relies on pixel art. It's not very interesting, but it's not too bad either. I think it fits the kind of story and the characters that are being told. Some graphics and most notably the text did not upscale properly on my 1440p screen, creating a pixelated blurry effect that was annoying. The soundtrack has a couple of pretty good moments. Once again, nothing exceptional, but nothing bad either.\n\nThe game is heavy on luck, and very punishing. I would recommend you DON'T play on the "original" difficulty. I personally went through "Original Light", which is still pretty frustrating at times. The game is also pretty repetitive, but it's kind of intended (if you finish it all the way through, you'll figure out why). Something I liked, however, was one puzzle that got me down for writing combinations of letters on a notepad to figure out the right one. It made me feel a little bit like the researcher that was looking for the code.\n\nThe additional epilogue that was recently released adds a ton of backstory and context to the plot of the game and it lifts the whole experience up. It's really good.\n\nIf I had to give an arbitrary rating to this game, it'd be 7/10. It has a few flaws, but if you're tolerant enough to look past some design flaws, if you like games that try to break the mold, and if you like a narrative-heavy story that does not feel overwhelming (unlike some games that throw 300 codex entries at you), I definitely recommend you give Gods Will Be Watching a go.","May 30, 2015","true","4.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

This becomes evident early on in the game where, as an example, a character has a chance of dying, but if they do, they show up again in the next chapter like nothing happened at all. The game literally retcons a character's death. There is an explanation given later on (timelines, Groundhog Day), but it feels lazy and unsatisfying.\n\nThe other problem is that it's deliberately difficult in a way that isn't fun. Unless you're on narrative mode, if you get through any scene on the first try, it's by sheer luck. Randomness has a high chance of wrecking you, and even with minimal random elements, most of the puzzles require a few deaths and restarts before you have a handle on how things work.\n\nThe game has a deliberate theme of helplessness and futility that carries over to the mechanics, which seems intentional. As a concept it's interesting, but "let's make a game that's unpleasant to play" is a self-defeating thing that exists only for the artistic statement.

Although this is a good game with plenty of decisions that will bear weight on you in the end, this game has many scenarios where there isn't really a right or correct answer, leaving a character dead or injured, this can be frustrating at times.\n\nOverall, if you want a point and click game that isn't so much about puzzles, but decision making, this is one of those games.","February 7, 2015","true","6.8"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

It's a narratively-driven resource/risk management game with a text interface. But the gameplay isn't the most interesting part of it. It has a pretty enigmatic story that's heavy at first, everything is kinda confusing and doesn't seem to make much sense (like a character dying, but then still talking in cutscenes)... but if you keep going, everything clears up. It's meta, but not like "The Stanley Parable" is. It doesn't feel stale, already-explored, or cliché.\n\nThe presentation relies on pixel art. It's not very interesting, but it's not too bad either. I think it fits the kind of story and the characters that are being told. Some graphics and most notably the text did not upscale properly on my 1440p screen, creating a pixelated blurry effect that was annoying. The soundtrack has a couple of pretty good moments. Once again, nothing exceptional, but nothing bad either.\n\nThe game is heavy on luck, and very punishing. I would recommend you DON'T play on the "original" difficulty. I personally went through "Original Light", which is still pretty frustrating at times. The game is also pretty repetitive, but it's kind of intended (if you finish it all the way through, you'll figure out why). Something I liked, however, was one puzzle that got me down for writing combinations of letters on a notepad to figure out the right one. It made me feel a little bit like the researcher that was looking for the code.\n\nThe additional epilogue that was recently released adds a ton of backstory and context to the plot of the game and it lifts the whole experience up. It's really good.\n\nIf I had to give an arbitrary rating to this game, it'd be 7/10. It has a few flaws, but if you're tolerant enough to look past some design flaws, if you like games that try to break the mold, and if you like a narrative-heavy story that does not feel overwhelming (unlike some games that throw 300 codex entries at you), I definitely recommend you give Gods Will Be Watching a go.","May 30, 2015","true","4.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I have not seen everything that the game has to offer. This is sort of a 'first impressions' review. If I have to alter the review or write a new one in the future, I will, but I'm pretty sure this covers most of what's going on.\n\nThis is a trial-and-error game. A 'ooh, what does this button do' kind of game. It's a learning process, and if you beat then entire game on the first try of your first time loading it, then you've just been insanely lucky and there's all that is to it. If you don't like repeating processes to improve your game, then you're not going to like this game at all.\n\nI didn't find this game difficult. I didn't get anything correct on the first try, and I was stuck in that damn desert for hours, but nothing seemed difficult to me. And when Original is labeled as difficult, I expected Easy to be... About as hard as it was for me. If you jumped in on Original without understanding how things worked, then you're not gonna have a good time, but you should be able to pick up what's going on very quickly.\n\nWhen the game was harsh and unforgiving, it felt like it was supposed to be harsh and unforgiving. I found myself speed-clicking through repeating cutscenes after losing a level(?) but that was the only time I ever felt annoyed with it, and I barely even felt it, then.\n\nThe graphics and animation are pretty solid. I mention below that a few things looked buggy for me, but I'm going to look for these things the next time I play to see if it's a problem or just something that happens (or is supposed to happen)? But overall things are really, really good. The sound and effects are well-placed, a little loud in some places, but 99% of the time they hit the nail on the head.\n\nNow, this is where we enter spoiler territory.\n\nSeriously, spoilers from here on out.\n\nOne of the problems I had with it was how abrupt the ending felt. It felt like I was just understanding what was going on, and then it was over without explaining it. We learn that Burden's experienced this world/timeline over and over (saves and reloads), but we never really learn why. It just is. The very ending, past the credits, might suggest to a wormhole or a rip in time, but we're kind of left hanging (probably to make room for a sequel), and there's this weird void of 'I don't get it' that lingers.\n\nI can understand why people would think the story and characters are stale. Me, personally, I like the idea of a team doing what it needs to do, and even though the characters were a little generic, that's not a bad thing. All of their roles were made clear and you understood what needed to be done.\n\nThe characters of Xenolifer were... Eh. I understand that they were background, but at the very last scene, I had no idea who the people I was holding hostage were or why I should care. And I did my damndest to read and retain the information, but if I shot Claire's son... I mean, aside from it raising and lowering certain stats, I didn't have any reason for not doing it. I didn't have a reason for caring about these people other than the game telling me that I should.\n\nI guess what I'm saying is that we didn't get a whole lot of Burden's background with that organization, and I kinda wanted it. The game has it's limitations, but I would have much rather preferred feeling for characters out of my own volition rather than the game telling me that I should care about them.\n\nThose are really the only problems I have with the game, and they're minor. Some places seemed a little glitchy with the graphics, but I'm going to be playing it through again to see if it's a persisting problem or just a random one.\n\nAll in all, it's a good game, and in my opinion it was worth the time and money (I bought it on sale, but it's definitely worth the $10).\n\nIf I had to give it a grade:\n\nGraphics: A\nStory: B\nCharacters: B\nActual Gameplay: A\n\nTl;dr ...

Game is pretty.\n\nI will preface this by saying that I don't enjoy luck based games, especially those that punish the player almost purely on luck.  I do enjoy narrative games though, and for that reason I have played this game on narrative mode.\n\nI enjoy this game conceptually.  The themes of circular time, heavy social issues, and tough survival elements makes this game interesting.  However, I don't think the game came through on many of its ideas and in general, could use a lot of work.\n\nThe narrative is awful.  I played through the entire story including the epilogue so that I might understand the story more thoroughly. All of the characters had the same type of speech, and all in all it felt like every character was the same person, which is a sign of poor writing.  The writing was superfluous and flowery with no real meaning behind the words.  The emphasis on depth and the urgency of the each scenario wasn't reflected in the writing.\n\nThe main character has points where he just jumps into these auto-fellatious monologues which is to say,  I didn't enjoy at all. I felt the overall philosophical message the writer was trying to communicate was flawed. Unfortunately,  the writing projects depth, but is unable to deliver. I didn't care for Burden, or the biblical and pseudo victorian-esque naming of his character.\n\nThe narrative then in turn suffers from the main game mechanics in which there are several scenarios where you depend on luck and management of resources in a survival situation.  If this is your type of thing, then go for it; I did not enjoy this.  Even if this is a game mechanic is intended by the developers as what they were aiming for, it doesn't make it a good mechanic.  The high failure rate coupled with the fact the survival portions of the games need so much time to complete is awful.  This is most prominent in chapter 3.  I played it on narrative mode, so I didn't have to restart as many times however, it quickly became frustrating and that frustration takes away from the narrative in a way that I became more focused on completing the objective than the characters who can easily die.  This is tedious, and I understand they were probably going for a Dark Souls thing (I liked Dark Souls a lot), but the mechanics come off as cumbersome and don't encourage exploration or different tactics as the choice of tactics are limited anyway.\n\nFurther, it doesn't actually matter if the characters die because of spoilers. Again, there is a narrative reason for this but I felt that it cheapened the story.\n\nI will say that the visuals are beautiful. I enjoyed the aesthetic of the game immensely. I particularly liked the desert scenery and thought the navigation portion of the game was one of the strongest parts gameplay wise. The music was not memorable, which is unfortunate.","February 24","false","5.3"," 13 of 27 people (48%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","48","13","27","0","3"

Nice presentation can't salvage it.\n\nEach level consists of a rather shallow 'puzzle.' Usually this is some combination of managing 'risk' and 'reward' bars: Choose research to increase your success level, but it also increases your fatigue! Drink coffee to lower your fatigue but it increases your caffeine! And then add like 3-10 of those on top and there's your 'game.' Hiding the levels doesn't make this fun or interesting (his 'fatigue' meter isn't visible, but you can see him start to pant heavily, for example).\n\nThe systems are contrived enough that the game will spend a lot of time explaining your different options every level. But it's not usually enough for you to actually know what the limits are (is he a little tired or is he going to die next turn?) so you'll still have to do it all multiple times, trial & error style. Random events don't help things.\n\nYou can turn off random events to prevent unfair deaths, and you can play on 'light' mode to decrease the amount of trial & error you'll need to do, but even then you're left with a basic, slow-paced game that makes you pick the same options over and over again to progress.","November 20, 2015","false","6.1"," 8 of 17 people (47%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","47","8","17","0","0"

If you've watched the trailer for the game you're probably thinking that the game is story-driven and has a lot of tough moral choices.  In reality that is very, very far from what the game is.  I believe a lot of the negative reviews end here; the game, simply put, is not what is advertised at all on the Steam page.  I can't really hold it against these reviews since I will agree it is very misleading.\n\nWhat the game actually consists of are tense, puzzling and incredibly difficult crisis situations where you need to plan your every move carefully.  One mistake can ruin all of your progress and since there are no checkpoints, you'll be right back at the beginning.  It's basically a point and click and you're spending all of your time clicking through menus to find the choice you want.  But while the gameplay isn't exactly thrilling, it does a very good job of making an impact while you're playing it.  It's a very graphic and brutal game despite being pixel art.\n\nAside from the marketing, the next biggest complaint you'll see is that the game is difficult and arguably unfairly so.  It's true; the game is incredibly difficult, luck can ruin a chapter through no fault of your own and you will die many, many, many times.  That being said, you slowly figure out what the best decisions are and how to deal with certain situations.  It's difficult, it's unfair, but it's not impossible and frankly I think the difficulty level contributes a lot to the atmosphere and tension of the game.\n\nOverall I recommend it pretty highly.  It's a point and click adventure with an impressively dark, gritty and brutal atmosphere that will leave you feeling bad about your choices.","July 27, 2014","true","3.9"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","1"

It's definitely not for everybody but it's a unique game with a high level of challenge. Just don't go in expecting it to be something it's not. It's not a classic point and click adventure and it has a lot of randomized elements. Each chapter essentially plays on one screen. One of the main criticisms I mostly agree with that I've seen in other reviews is how the moral choices about how you play don't have as much weight as you might expect. But the game still succeeds in generating a high level of tension in the player, especially on the first playthrough. If a chapter gets too frustrating it is always possible to play through on an easier difficulty. Lastly, I found the art and sound design to be quite excellent and a pleasure to experience. I would say buy it on sale.","October 26, 2014","true","9.8"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

The artstyle, story, and concept seemed fantastic. The gameplay of the original was simplistic but thought out. However, with the game out and me having played it, I think I was expecting something a bit different than what I got.\n\nThe gameplay, at it's core, is resource and time management. In many of the 7 scenarios you will be given a time limit and you will be given a goal to acheive within that limit. You will need to make sure certain things happen. When things start to go bad they will go absolutely ♥♥♥♥ up.  Trial and error will inevitably happen. Hell, the final fight is one long trial and error sequence. You will die and replay the same scenario, skipping the same dialogue over and over. It'll feel more like dark souls than a puzzle game with all the death occuring both to you and around you.\n\nOther reviewers hate the fact that the game is too hard, but don't want to turn it down to easy for some reason. It's a bit like FTL, in which Easy is considered a regular difficulty and Normal is considered a harder difficulty. In the Original difficulty, you are forced to survive by the skin of your teeth, making sacrifices and probably regretting what you've done That's what the game is supposed to make you feel. Dread and despair.\n\nI feel like everyone, including myself, went into this game hoping it would be more of a narrative experience, something akin to The Wolf Among Us. However, this was just not the case, and people got too hyped. Choices don't have much impact at all in the whole scheme of things, and the game is too short to even really be able to reflect any previous decisions, at least not for very long.\n\nI love this game's artstyle, music, plot, characters, and dialogue, and I like the universe it takes place in. But when it comes to actually playing the game, it's just a series of puzzle-like scenarios that need solving. And even then, less puzzle solving and more time and resource management.\n\nTL;DR the game is hard but thats not the issue. The repetition and trial-and-error gameplay drag it down. The concept and artstyle is excellent, but people seemed like they wanted a Telltale game-like narrative experience and instead got a game with 7 different puzzle scenarios in which you are forced to make difficult, soul crushing choices. I would not recommend it if you're quick to frustrate or if you're the kind of person that plays a game trying to get the best possible outcome storywise.","July 31, 2014","false","16.4"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","4"

To the former, the things it tackles, like slavery, holding hostages, torture, are not easy ones, particularly when you're sometimes on the giving end of them, so it's not a light hearted romp.\n\nBut it's the mechanics that kills it.  While it doesn't always have numerical feedback as to how things are progressing (like what level of calmness / rebellion your hostages are at) which is something I actually appreciate ... it's sometimes unclear as to what particular 'gestures' mean.  Are they really anxious or just following orders?  The game lampshades this in the final act, showing that you have to go over and over and over again to understand HOW to play the game ... which isn't a bad thing in and of itself.\n\nWhat IS bad is that it not only requires you to go through some sections again and again without skipping, some of the things just take FOREVER to accomplish ... the transitions could be snappier and the 'start from the beginning of the chapter' is unforgiving.  Further, even if you're just there for the narrative, the game doesn't give it out sequentially, but instead sometimes semi-randomly, so the point they're making varies ... and if you don't want to miss it, you have to read it all, which is sad because it gets repetitive as you have to restart over and over again to find the patterns to win.\n\nIf you can get this free or very cheap, it's an interesting few hours, but be prepared for some painful mechanics.","May 9","false","7.4"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

The characters were interesting and I genuinely was doing my best to save them all (even Abraham even though after a while that seemed impossible).\nThe art style is minimalistic with pixels, and yet somehow it still has a lot of impact. I was impressed at how some character deaths albeit being very pixelated were incredibly brutal (just goes to show you what a good developer can do with good graphical design)\nOverall I would recommend this to a friend or anyone who really enjoys the point and click genre with a difficult twist reminiscent of Hotline Miami.\nIt was a very enjoyable experience and I look forward to more of the developer's games in the future.\n\n\n(Note:\nEven though you can enjoy the story on easy difficulty, I find that the story segments seem a lot more rewarding and the overall experience more satisfying on classic difficulty.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Tactiderp/recommended/274290/","Tactiderp","Tactiderp","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Tactiderp/","81 products in account","So a lot of people have been giving this game some negative reviews for various reasons ranging from `Too hard` to `Bad story` to `Nothing you do matters` etc. Most of these reviews are in my opinion just people complaining without having enough information so how about this; I will go through the Most Useful complaints and most common complaints and comment on them.\n\n`The game is not focused on story/Has a bad story`\nThis I can say is probably being said by those who aren`t really into reading dialogue. Not trying to insult them and I am sure there are many exceptions, but as someone who has completed the game I can safely say that the story is very very good, not going to spoil it though.\n\n`Game is unfairly diffcult/ No checkpoints/ Unfair RNG`\nThe game is hard, very hard. It involves a lot of thinking through your moves and planning ahead. One slip up could cost you the round. I wouldn`t however call it unfair. Every failure is your own fault, YOU took an unneccesary risk, YOU didn`t prioritize, even with the presence of an RNG everything is your fault. The game lays out all the mechanics of the puzzle from the beginning and if you pay attention you will know exactly how things work from the moment the puzzle starts. You will probably miss something admittedly, your (probably) human, and there are some things you will just have to test to confirm your suspicions on a mechanic. Concerning the RNG you will probably be fine as long as you don`t try your luck to much. 60% is a magical number separating success and failure in my experience. Having played numerous X-Com originals and remakes I can say that the RNG is fair enough. No checkpoints? Play one of the puzzles and you will realise how much that would break the game. It removes all suspense and worry about your choices.\n\nWell this review is getting a bit long I will try and wrap it up quickly.\n\n`Choice doesn`t matter/Dead characters magically reappear`\nEvery choice you make influences something. Though as in every game with choice there are only so many ways it can end seeing someone die then come back is, creepy. You may say "Well that is dumb that someone who dies comes back, that mean there are no concequences!" I can understand that on the surface this seems dumb and when I heard this for the first time I was concerned on the quality of game if it did this. Then my team was decimated on chapter 4. Only a few of us survived, then I saw them at the briefing at the beginning of the next chapter and they were... warped. Quote from the main character "Why do I feel like they already died. I need a vacation" Things start to make more sense as to why people die but `live` as you go on.\n\n\nSo I think that is a good place to stop concerning what I thought were some of the most supported damning ideas about this game. I would so much call this a review as a mass response to real reviews. I think this game is awesome though I can understand it not being for everyone, I suggest looking at someone playing Chapter One to get a feel for what the game really is before putting money down. Chapter One doesn`t have a TON of story so it shouldn`t spoil much. Northern Lion`s first episode on this game represents it well and he fails so it won`t tell you how to complete the puzzle. I reccomend starting there unless you know of someone else to watch.\n\nQuestions? Concerns? Complaints about this not actually being a review and me being a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ blind fanboy? Comment on it. I am new to presenting ideas like this or reviewing in general so I could use the feedback.","July 31, 2014","true","11.4"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","1"

The two things that really shine about this game to me are gameplay and the story, and are the main things I'll go over. I'll go into depth on these and any other subjects of the review in separate sections so you can look at what you're interested in. (warning- the words level and chapter are interchangeable)\n\nQuick review of Collector's Edition- The Collector's Edition adds no content to the game, but rather, gives you a wealth of non-game content- with the amazing soundtrack, a prequel comic focused on Liam and Shaman, and an artbook that has some great tidbits of information scattered throughout it, it's definitely worth the extra cash. #yourewelcomedevs\n\nGameplay- This game is a one-of-a-kind game. I think of it as a new sub-genre of point and click games- a 'dynamic point and click resource management/ emotional thriller' type-thing. Crap, it's hard to explain this game. First off, this game is a seriously challenging game. You have to take into account all of the factors of each level and plan and manage accordingly. It's a unique experience that tests your mettle in many ways- it tests your adaptability, planning, attentiveness, presents lots of ethical and moral dilemmas, too. This game might not be for the faint of heart, not only because it is mentally and occasionally emotionally challenging, but it also has some surprisingly graphical and gory deaths that I had no idea could be done with pixel art (0.o). Seriously, this game can mess with your mind if you get too invested into it- for those who enjoy that, like me, go ahead, but if you aren't into that, treat with caution (or meds).\n\nStory- This game has a seriously beautiful and detailed story and lore. Although you don't dig too deep into the story or lore in the first few levels, they grow exponentially throughout the later levels, and in the last 2 levels and the new final chapter, it connects so many of the dots the game left lying around that it left me breathless. I really don't want to spoil the story for you, as the story really is a huge part of the game and what got me hooked, but keep in mind while you play the game that you're eventually going to see the whole picture. If you think you're prone to stress or boredom from suspense like that, you might not enjoy the game, but if you're patient about the revelations of the story then you'll be rewarded by those in the final few chapters. The Collector's Edition will help add to your understanding of the story.\n\nI bid you farewell with one more comment- since this game is about puzzle solving and story following, it won't have a lot of replay value (unless you're a serious completionist).","June 1, 2015","true","20.1"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Hard, frustrating, punishing, never tells you what you're doing wrong to fail the mission. And I like it for that, nowadays games always provide the exact explanation about what you have to do, reminders, hints and so on, as if the players were stupids or childs.\n\nI wouldn't call it a point and click adventure game though, at least not a classic one. It's more of a puzzle game, with a very compelling narrative aspect (you'll face very delicate moral decisions) and gorgeous pixel art. So, if you're looking for a proper point and click adventure maybe this is not the game you're looking for, but if you're up for really challenging puzzles (not complex puzzles, but situation in which you have to control a very large number of different factors and keep all of them in balance if you want to succeed) and moral dilemmas, well, I can assure you you'll end up angry, but you'll probably love it.

It does a good job of making you feel like you're under pressure and like every choice matters.\n\nUnfortunately, that wears off after the first playthrough.\n\nIn Gods Will Be Watching, you're put into all kinds of bad situations, such as a hostage situation where you'll have to control all of the hostages and hack into a system to steal information while keeping the authorities at bay. You get all kinds of moral dilemmas, like your crewmembers breaking down mid-mission, forcing you to try and stabilize them emotionally, to hostages becoming panicked and making a suicidal dash for the door.\n\nThe only problem is the game's difficulty and repetitiveness. The game prides itself on being unforgivable and difficult, but that's really the biggest flaw. Every time you fail, you'll have to start over from the very beginning, even if that reverts 10 minutes of progress. Every single time you die, you'll be forced to play the same part again, which will take another 5 or 10 minutes.\n\nYou've already gone through this situation before, though. The emotion and tension has worn off, so now it's just you clicking buttons and hoping that the game looks favorably upon you. And if you press the wrong button? Why, say goodbye to the last 10 minutes of progress you made.\n\nSeriously, this game has an interesting atmosphere and story already, but I couldn't be bothered to finish it. Even on the easiest ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ difficulty, it's just so mind-numbingly boring. I'd like to experience the story, but I'm hardly gonna pay attention to it when I'm bored out of my mind.\n\nIn summary: Gameplay is solid enough, atmosphere is pretty good. Lack of saves and extreme difficulty lead to extremely tedious repetitiveness, which makes the game pretty much unbearable for me.\n\nI wanted to like this game, but no. Definitely not recommend.\n\nOh, yeah. I should also add that the game runs like absolute ♥♥♥♥. It somehow uses more RAM than next-gen triple A games. I find that the framerate dropped constantly and there was a load of stuttering, even though it's just a little bit of pixel art. And then alt-tabbing. It took me about five minutes to recover after I alt-tabbed from this game and put my PC to sleep.

But it's still great. My main problem with the game up to this point was that a lot of the events during the scenarios had very harsh stochastic elements -- so basically, no matter how well you had learned to beat the scenarios (through painful trial and error) you could be totally screwed over by the roll of a dice. This kind of thing can be OK occasionally, and add an element of risk to the game, but I reckon it was turned up way too high in the earlier versions. The latest patch includes a mode that removes a lot of the stochastic elements, which I think makes the game a lot better, but without lowering the difficulty TOO much. So, yeah, no worries there any more. Other than that, it's a pretty neat little game that looks fantastic and is set in a cool sci-fi universe. I think people will either love this or hate it -- no middle ground -- because the gameplay is pretty niche. There are a few other issues here and there (why do characters that died keep coming back to life??) But I really enjoyed it, even though the gameplay can be very tough, I still kept coming back.","August 12, 2014","true","5.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Also, I first wrote a review for this game before "The Mercy Update," so I'll mainly be talking in reference to this update.\n\nGameplay: Skip Original and go to Puzzle. Trust me; you'll have a better time. Original is difficult but laden with RNG, Puzzle is difficult but predictable. In fact, I never even beat Chapter 1 on Original mode due to how crazy the RNG could get for me at times. Puzzle mode, on the other hand, did a good job of balancing difficulty and atmosphere, which was one of my biggest complaints about the game before Puzzle Mode was a thing. While it is hard to really compare the atmospheres between the two modes (Original Lite, the first one I played and Puzzle Mode), I think if I had been able to play Puzzle Mode from the get-go that I would have had so much more intense of a playthrough rather than me just clicking through the menus hoping for the stars to align.\n\nDon't get me wrong, though; there's still some trial and error here. Fortunately, due to the nature of Puzzle mode, you won't see right actions not work or wrong actions work fine due to RNG. It really does make the game a whole lot better. While some may argue that this detracts from some of the replay value, I really don't see this game as a game to be replayed a lot. Anyways, even with the predictable nature of Puzzle mode, the atmosphere of the game was still very well portrayed. Apart from that, though; that's really all I have left to say about this game. Puzzle mode really did save this game. It still may not be the most fun of games, but in Puzzle mode there's enough outs so that RNG doesn't actually screw you over while still retaining quite a bit of atmosphere that can be portrayed in Original when the stars align. 7/10.\n\nStory: For the longest time I was worried that this would be one of those, "It's all in your head" stories. Then I was worried that it was a Digital Devil Saga-esque thing. What's really going on... could honestly use a lot more explanation. The game makes constant references to Gods (hell, it's in the title), but you never really know if there are actual Gods or if it's just religious adulation. Everything else is pretty well explained, so leaving that last pretty important thread dangling feels kinda... lazy. The concept is pretty neat, and I've always been a fan of Gameplay and Story elements synergizing to enhance the overall gameplay experience. As for the dialogue and characters, there's a lot of dialogue. Some of the characters, such as in Chapter 5 don't really go much further than faceless military bros, but that's alright. For the characters that are developed, they're not bad. In fact, that's a pretty good synopsys of this game's story: it's not bad. 7/10.\n\nGraphics: Oh man, if you've even got a remote interest in Pixel Art, you could stare for days at this game. Again, it's another one of those instances where I don't need to tell you how good the game looks. I don't have the special edition, so I wasn't able to get my hands on the artbook, but I wouldn't mind getting that in the future. So don't worry; the quality of the art in the screenshots are in no way deceptive about the overall quality of the art in this game. A ton of effort was put into it, and it shows. As for the technical aspects of this game, it fullscreens to your native resolution, and it did so for mine without a hitch. Some people said they wanted Antialiasing for this game, but to be perfectly honest, there's like one cutscene that would've benefitted from it. So yeah; I don't see it as a big deal that antialiasing isn't here. Overall, this game just looks fantastic, and it stays so from start to finish. 5/5.\n\nSound: Pretty much the OST to talk about here, and Fingerspit did one hell of an OST for this game. Seriously, there's only one song that you should listen to to know how good this soundtrack is, and that's the song for Chapter 5, titled Legend. Pretty much every track in this game is heavily laden with atmosphere to suit the needs of the scene. There really isn't any "traditional" music, in the sense of a common song structure, but it's certainly something that can be listened to outside of the game to really set a mood. 5/5.\n\nOverall scores are: 7/7/5/5; cumulative score of 8.0/10. Again, Puzzle Mode really does save this game for me.","August 8, 2014","true","11.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

This is a game that forces you to manage your time and manage it well; a mechanic that is just as refreshing as it is difficult. To fully enjoy this game you are going to have to put a few hours into it, something that the majority of these negative reviewers have not done.\n\nSure, the end product is completely different to what I expected. At first I hated what I was playing. It wasn't until I lost the first level for the millionth time that I realised just how rewarding it is to progress bit by bit until you manage to perfectly use the short supply of time that you have.\n\nAll in all this is a trial and error game and it is absurdly difficult, but it is rare to find a game these days that is truly as rewarding as it is difficult to master.

It's a gritty survival game in the point n' click format. That said, it is a story-driven experience that gives context to the challenge, trial-and-error, consequences, and the prices you pay to reach your goals. It's all about managing your resources and paying attention to other people's morale and actions. The game actually lets you know how your decisions work, it just requires more of reading between the lines and paying attention to what's been said. The Original difficulty throws in chance, so I recommend Puzzle Mode to keep a consistent challenge.\n\nThe story of Sgt. Burden's mission to keep his teammates alive and face terrorist group Xenolifer is one that requires more thought. It's not accessible for anyone who wants a simple plot, let alone a straight-forward explanation to some of its, to avoid spoilers, more avant-garde direction with the narrative contextualizing the game mechanics of choices and consequences. I was close to accusing Gods Will Be Watching for a plot-hole or two, but finishing the game and letting the story marinate in my mind made it much more acceptable and logical.\n\nGods Will Be Watching is not intended to be a simple and light-hearted experience. I would go as far and say this is the point n' click equivalent of The Last Of Us, Dark Souls, and Metal Gear Solid 2, in terms of inaccessible but rewarding narratives.","November 5, 2014","true","11.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Through out all of the missions there is an easier way of doing things and there is the morally right way of doing things. In simple terms if you have less people you dont need to spend extra resourses on them. What makes this game worth playing is the challenges that it has for the levels. It is relatively easy to play through the game on original difficulty and get through it, however, when you are trying to do the right thing is when it gets difficult and this is where the challenges come in.\n\nThe game is punishing and some times it does rely complete on chance, however, this is rare and it makes getting through the missions that much more satisfying, not only that the missions are short (20mins -30mins) so if you lose halfway through it's not a game killer.\n\nThis game is for anyone that likes to best tested. It requires you to want to make the right desicions but to sometimes be able to put winning the game above what is morally right.","April 11, 2015","true","12.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Everyone can die but you.\n\nPros:\n•Very atmospheric and beautiful pixel art, a good example is the desert/canyon level.\n•You go to a variety of places, doing a variety of tasks. No two levels are similar.\n•Choices for easier difficulties, though discouraged. They even added a choice to remove all random elements, in response to complaints.\n•When they say difficult decisions they mean it, they hold up on that part.\n•Shows a neat little graph-like thing of all the decisions you made, and what percent of other players made those decisions.\n\nImportant Notes:\n•The game does not save to the steam cloud; I played half the game when I stayed at my cousin's house for the week, and when I got home none of it was uploaded. This may have changed, if its important to you, look a little more into it.\n•The game occasionally makes you take out a pen and a sheet of paper, which in my opinion made it a little more interesting, but some may not like that.\n•The second level is a level about choosing how you receive torture. This level is one of the hardest, and truly affected me for about half an hour after each session of trying to beat it. Very dark stuff.\n\nCons:\n•If a crew member dies in one mission, they magically reappear in the next. I understand why, but they could have come up with some stupid excuse other than just *BAM* he's back and was never gone.\n•Can get somewhat tedious, often you get into a cycle of doing the same exact things.\n•Crashed once for me, erased some of my progress.\n\n6/10: For all that it is and however hard it tried, wasn't as gripping as some other games. It does supply what it advertises.","May 24, 2015","true","9.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It's all about efficient time and resource management, with hazards and dangers thrown in to cause hiccups in your plans. An enjoyment of micro-management is somewhat key, which can discourage some players. The game puts a focus on making hard decisions such as sacrificing lives for the sake of others (i.e. cannibalism of friends and hostage control and such). However, you are never "penalized" for decisions and losses made in the game, which has upset people in the past, you may see sacrificed characters in later chapters. The reasons for this are actually story-based, which is slyly explained in the later chapters. It's just far from obvious. It's up to the player to gauge their satisfation with their performance if they believed certain sacrifices weren't necessary.\n\nThe story invokes sci-fi and time-travel themes that really get your noggin pondering. I was certainly a bit bewildered and amazed my first playthrough.\n\nOh also, the music and art (in-game and unlockable) is amazing. Ch. 3 is practically my favorite in every way.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fatmayor/recommended/274290/","fatmayor","Fatmayor","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fatmayor/","93 products in account","Before posting my review, I would like to start out by saying I believe that this game should be played on Original Difficulty only, as it preserves the essence of the game which I will attempt to capture in the review.\n\nThis game really feels like this medium's 'great literature'.  It's not the most enjoyable experience out there in terms of gameplay, but it sure is a treat for the mind.  It somewhat reminds me of Lord of The Flies: I did not enjoy reading the actual book because the story infuriated me, however, I really appreciated the underlying themes and messages the book carries.  Gods Will be Watching is similar to LoTF in this aspect.\n\nPlayers control Sgt. Burden as he tries to keep himself and his team alive through 7 (there's also a free DLC chapter) brutally difficult scenarios.  Players will try, fail, and try again only to fail once more due to the heavy reliance on the RNG.  One might then begin to wonder if their choices even mean anything - up to 40 minutes of work can be wiped out by a single event that's not even within their control.  It creates this very tense environment, knowing that one is doing their best, yet is still not in control of their own fate: that privilage belongs to the Gods, who are indeed watching you.\n\nThis raises an important question: 'why would anyone want to play a game where they aren't in full control of their destiny?', and, at least in my interpretation, is the point.  This game isn't about the gameplay, but the overall experience.  Once one accepts that failure is inevitable in this game, one can plan around it.  Each failure will come with a lesson, thus increasing the odds of success on subsequent runs.  Once players accept and embrace the nature of the RNG will the game truly shine because then they will have fully grasped everything the game has to offer.  Failure in this game should not be a maddening experience, nay, it should be an enlightening one, even when it occurs through no fault of the player.\n\n(This paragraph section may contain some slight spoilers about the game's general theme and tone)\n\nOne might even wonder about the choices presented in the game, and of their significance; one might even begin to see the parallels drawn between the game and real life in this vast, possibly infinite, expanse of space we call home.  On a scale the size of the Universe, does anything anywhere even matter?\n\nThe entire game, from it's RNG elements, to its abundance of failure, to its minimalistic nature, to everything else, constitute a carefully woven lesson in Existential Nihilism, one that is retread and enforced in the game's finale, which brings every component and set peice together and wraps it up into a neat knot.  Every question posed by the game and even questions the player has about the game are brought to the fore and resolved in the finale - questions such as 'did my choices really matter?', 'why do I keep ending up wandering the desert when I fail?', and 'why are people who died in a previous chapter alive in the next?' are probably among the most important ones resolved.\n\nIn the face of such abundant failure, even the most difficult choices become mundane, almost routine, throughout the millions of attemts at becoming the legend that is Sgt. Burden.\n\nThe one (free) DLC chapter emphasises the game's main points: it takes the ending and adds on a meta-ending to it, which carries the same themes as the original ending, and builds upon them, thus driving the fateful point home once and for all with tremendous force.  One important thing to note however, and I really want to emphasize this, is that the nature of the gameplay, namely, the focus on the RNG and seeming absentness of impactful moral choices, were by design, a fact that will only become apparent upon completion of the game.  The resource management gameplay aspect is simply a medium through which the developers convey their story.\n\nA friend recently mentioned to me that the game shares many parallels to the Myth of Sisyphus, and that given the situation presented in the DLC chapter, it seems to have served as inspiration or as a guiding foundation for this game.  I am definitely inclined to believe this is true, and its article on Wikipedia can explain Existential Nihilism/Absurdism much better than I can.\n\nI highly, highly recommend this game to anyone looking for a difficult (puzzle) experience or some excellent food for thought.\n\nBefore I conclude, I would like to pose a question to the reader, one that is best saved for after  all 8 chapters of the game have been completed.  From the perspective of a person in the real world, was the player one of the Gods who were watching Burden, one who knew that his plight was futile, yet compelled him to carry one despite the fact, and put him through the meat grinder over and over until the outcome, however arbitrary (think back to when Liam broke the 4th wall), was satisfactory?

And it kicked my ♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥ing hard.  I was frustrated, but I was also intrigued.  Punishing gameplay can be intentional and can often bely a fascinating enigma of a game.  Just ask any Dead/Dark Souls fans.\n\nI am writing this review to counter the many negative reviews I have seen of this game.  Anyone who has reviewed this game negatively has no ♥♥♥♥ing idea what they are talking about.  However, that is largely due to the fact that the game didn't start out with the multiple difficulties it has now.  Many reviewers played it when only the "Original" difficulty existed when the game is infuriatingly difficult for all but the most hardcore (which I am most empathetically not).\n\nI guess I was fortunate to not have time to get around to playing the game until the "Mercy Update" came out.  I had been following the game since I saw and played the game jam prototype.  In the prototype I barely made it 7 days without everything going to hell (The prototype was what became Chapter 4).  When I tried the commercial version on Original Light I was done before I was halfway to the Chapter 1 goal.  I had to play on Puzzle Mode Light.  LIGHT.  I am not an inexperienced gamer and I might have made it through on Puzzle Mode but considering how many times Chapter 5 kicked my ♥♥♥ I know I should not be so arrogant to think so.\n\nSimply put, anyone who complains about the difficulty (ESPECIALLY after they added the other difficulties) has no ♥♥♥♥ing clue what they are talking about.\n\nTHE POINT of the game is the difficulty.  It is the base DNA that was present even in the nascent prototype.  The difficulty MUST be high.  The entire point of the game is moral ambiguity and hard decisions.  How can a game force you to feel these things if the difficulty is not cranked up?  How can a game force you to choose between running out of food (which would cause characters with low morale to commit suicide) and killing the least useful member of your troop so that the others would survive, without making the "save everyone" option almost impossible?\n\nBut the Mercy Update fixes that.  Because the multitude of difficulties added makes this game accessible for players of all levels of masochism.  And that is a good thing.\n\nBecause the story is a masterpiece.  A complex tale of gray areas, branching pathways, personal discoveries, and hard choices.  The music is masterful in its creation of an atmosphere. The gameplay combines adventure game style branching pathways with the tense resource management of a thriller strategy game.  You will be surprised how tense this game will make you.\n\nBut most importantly, at least to a player such as myself, this game fulfills my criteria for "Games As Art".\n\nMany games can be considered art, but for me, the true pinnacles of the media embrace message and metaphor in a way no other medium can: through gameplay.\n\nI can't say much else about it due to spoilers, but the game embraces its branching pathways, gray areas, and hard moral choices into it's core story to create a metaphor about the hard choices we make through life.  When the gameplay and story intersect to become a metaphor unto themselves is when games truly become the sublime.\n\nThis game is EASILY one of the best games of 2014.  Many of us just needed the lower difficulties to see that.  Don't be so arrogant that you feel you can't play it on the lower difficulties.  The INTENT of the game is to be punishing and inspire HARD CHOICES.  It's fine if you can't handle that but if you dismiss this game out of frustration you are robbing yourself of one of the few experiences of a truly inspired piece of interactive software.","January 2, 2015","true","12.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The first such barrier will inevitably be the graphics.  For someone such as myself who was raised on sprite based games this retro graphic style is part of the allure but I know for others (such as my child) the gut reaction is "the graphics of that game suck!"  What you, the skeptical buyer needs to understand is that the graphics of this game are an aestetic and artistic choice.  Yes, this game could easily have been created utilizing modern 3d graphics and it probably would have still been fun.  The graphic style complements the entire game themetic:  do more with less.  The entire game you struggle to do as much as you can with extremely limited resources.  This theme can be read as the theme of the game in general, the game designers endeavoured to accomplish as much as they could with as little as possible.  We will return to this argument later.\n\nRelated to this first barrier is the second obstacle the player must overcome:  one of the most steep and unforgiving learning curves of any game I have played in perhaps a decade.  In a way this difficulty is appropriating the difficulty of older sprite based games before the invention of quicksaves and quickloads.  Not all of the complaints of the difficulty are without merit though.  I found the pacing of this difficulty somewhat random.  Instead of starting off difficult and ending up super difficult, near impossible levels are followed by relative walks-in-the-parks.  I think some better planning in this regard by the developers could have lead to a better recepection of the game.  That said,  I think the difficulty  of the game, like the sprite-based graphics is an artistic choice.   Ostensibly it is a love-letter to mind-blowingly difficult rogue-like games of yesteryear.  It is important to understand though that the difficulty of the game is supposed to be a mirror of the morally difficult situations you find yourself in in each level.  The threat of making a bad decision is made more visceral when you understand that you may be very close to having wasted nearly an hour of your time for nothing.\n\nIf, you are willing to perservere past these barriers, an extremely rich and rewarding experience awaits.  The game draws inspiration from such varied sources as Quentin Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs, the film Edge of Tomorrow, The Dark Tower series, as well as the entire encyclopedia of Science-Fiction tropes.  The two things this game does better than many others out there is tension and meta-gaming comentary.\n\nI'll try to keep this spoiler free but I must give kudos to the developers for showing how flat sprites can build tension.  In one level a torturer decides which device he is going to use that day.  His blocky sprite hands moves slowly from potential weapon to potential weapon and though you cannot really make out anything, you can envision it.  Even the way he slowly takes a sprite based drag from his sprite based cigarette builds a whole much greater than its constituent parts.  Ultimately, this game wags a shaming finger at AAA games who have access to million dollar CGI video and high end 3d graphics but who produce products empty and soul-less.\n\nAs I mentioned before this game seems to be speaking not only to its industry but to those who consume it.  The main characters name is "Burden" connoting not only his in-game responsibility but also how he functions as a work-horse for you, the player.  The character of Burden slowly becomes aware that there is something awry in his decision making process and that problem is *you*, the player.  The titular "watching gods" are not some fictional deities, but you, the player meddling and interferring in the gaming world.  The game asks the player to not be a detached meddling god but to invest in the characters emotionally.  The game provides a compelling world (via excellent sound, story, and yes, graphics) and asks you to simply try.\n\nAnd based upon the metacritic score, many players seem unwilling to do so.  They would rather quickload up their quicksave and blow the heads off of people wearing turbans and then teabag them with special American flag boxers they purchased as a DLC.  The developers of this game have recognized a sort of illness in this industry and like Burden and his cohorts have attempted to make a remedy for it.  Ultimately, the choice of whether to take that cure (and purchase this game) is yours.\n\nChoose wisely.","January 3, 2015","true","20.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It is a turn-based "point-and-click moral puzzler" set against a futuristic sci-fi / bioterrorism setting. I just finished it (rare for me to actually finish a game these days), clocking in at around 13 hours. It is great and you should play it and here's why.\n\nFirstly, what is this game about? It's hard to describe what genre it is in. UI-wise, it's a point-and-click puzzler, but it doesn't work like normal puzzle games. It's divided into six scenarios, and each has totally different mechanics. You give orders to your guys, and each order typically takes some unit of time, so you have to prioritize which actions to take (although some scenarios let you do actions in parallel). Do you execute a hostage to keep the others in line? Do you free a hostage in exchange for more time? It essentially comes down to juggling a set of variables, and if any of them drops below a threshold, you die. There are always a couple of different valid approaches to each problem.\n\nFor example, in the first scenario, you take hostages while your team attempts to hack into a research station. You're barricaded in and the police are slowly marching in. You need to keep the hostages in line (calm so they don't make a run for it, but not too calm that they try to take you down), negotiate to keep the police a safe distance away, increase your hacking rate, and keep your hacker from being locked out of the system. Fail to attend to any of these duties for too long, and you're hosed.\n\nThis game is very hard. You'll often try each scenario a dozen or more times before you finally succeed. (It has easy mode settings, but it begs you not to use them or you'll spoil the fun.) And that's the whole fun of it: experimenting with the various controls in each scenario and learning the mechanics by observing the results. After a few scenarios, you'll have a general sense for how to be good at GWBW, but you won't have a clue how to tackle the next scenario. There's also a strong luck component involved, and this is important: you can't win just by memorizing a sequence of actions or by trial and error. You must understand the mechanics so well that you can maximize your probability of success. Once you've "cracked" a scenario, you can beat the random number generator and can win it in 2 or 3 tries. (In this sense, the game feels a bit like FTL.)\n\nThe 8-bit graphics are 8-bit style are drawn and animated nicely; the music is splendid. The story is epic and well worth following (though it is extremely complicated and involves reading huge walls of text). It also features extremely graphic violence, as well as some bad gender stereotyping (the few women in the game are all "nurturing" type characters). The tough question for me is: is the game really about moral choices? On the one hand, you can just treat each scenario as an optimization problem, with each character being just a resource to be used up. But it's also hard not to feel an attachment to the characters and want to keep them all alive. The one critical flaw in the moral choices is that it doesn't matter who dies in a given scenario: they are always alive again at the start of the next one. That tends to devalue the characters' lives in each scenario. But I'll admit, it would be pretty hard to design a story so dynamic when most characters can potentially die on most missions.\n\nGods Will Be Watching is, at its core, a deeply mechanics-based game that rewards experimentation, observation, and understanding. You can play the original "survival" prototype here[www.deconstructeam.com], but be aware that this version is severely unpolished compared to the final game (the prototype scenario is in the final game and much improved). And remember... GODS WILL BE WATCHING!","January 18, 2015","true","16.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Might be a bit haphazard since I just finished the game like 20 minutes ago and it's 2am, but whatever.\n\nLet's get a few quick things out there first:\n\nMechanics are standard point-and-click, not much to say about it. The only method of control you have is your mouse. That's it. It's a point-and-click game.\n\nGraphics are absolutely phenomenal, in my opinion. The art is gorgeous. I will admit the font used is difficult for me, PERSONALLY, to read, but others may not have a hard time with it like I did. I ended up getting used to it but it was still a bit of a pain and that's my only real complaint.\n\nNow to the meatier stuff. Gods Will Be Watching is a relatively short game - I finished it in five hours, though I will admit I was on the easiest difficulty and therefore failed probably a hell of a lot less than I might've if I were playing on a harder difficulty. Point is, I got five hours out of it, which I felt was fulfilling. I didn't feel the game was lacking.\n\n"u failed a bunch on the easiest difficulty git gud" Yeah, yeah, I suck at video games, whatever. The thing is ... this game kind of wants you to fail. That sounds horrible, but it's honestly part of the experience of playing the game. The difficulty selection even tells you the harder settings are going to be punishing and tells you that YOU WILL FAIL. It doesn't matter how good you are at video games, you're going to fail at least once, and seeing how difficult the easiest difficulty mode was, I hope you like screaming at your computer.\n\nLike, there's no beating around the bush, it's a stressful game. I came out of it angry and stressed out. I was stressed out and irritable through the entire experience. If you want a nice relaxing game, this is not it. This is a game to get mad at. This is a game that you play when you decide you hate yourself and want God to punish you for your sins.\n\nIt's unfair and stressful and punishing and I loved it. This game makes a mechanic and a story out of failing and I love it. To put it as simply as possible, the game is pretty much about failing. It's about failure. It's about learning from your mistakes and doing your best in a world that wants you to fail. That's about as much as I can say without getting into SPOILERS.\n\nNow, honestly, the story might be a bit hard to follow at first, because it doesn't really tell you anything. You have to do a lot of filling in of the blanks as you go. The game tells you so much about the world and the characters without really telling you anything at all and it's done super well.\n\nThe game is written in a way that if a character you've known for five minutes dies, it's enough to evoke such a strong enough emotional reaction from you that you immediately want to restart just so you can fix it (and you can restart a level whenever you want, you CAN get your ideal conclusion).\n\nIn my opinion, GWBW is one of the best games I've played this year. It won't be everyone's cup of tea, especially not with the whole "HAVE FUN WANTING TO GNAW YOUR ARMS OFF, PLAYER" thing, but I urge everyone to try this beautiful little gem out.","April 8, 2015","true","8.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

This game have great graphics (if you into pixel-style of course), great music, great story and you can say from the first minutes of gameplay, that developers put heart and soul into this production.  Game is VERY challenging and beating it on "Orginal" may take some time, but! it gives a LOT of satisfaction and you  know that your time was not wasted. Forget about tutorials in game, because there is no any - everything you need to figure out yourself - and I like it that way, because it also make game more challenging. So - if you afraid of challange and afraid of something that requires thinking I strongly suggest that you leave this title alone, but! if you into hard games with great story and great pixel-style graphics and great music, I suggest you should give Gods will be watching a try!","January 10, 2015","true","19.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It's an experiment into making the player uncomfortable and trying to mirror what it would be like to go through these situations, in a much similar fashion to a game like Papers, Please. It falls often, but it's notable how hard it tries. Sometimes the intention is bright enough to make it something you have to play and then think about to understand. It isn't a "fun" game, it's actually quite a stressful game, to the point where at times I simply wanted to stop playing, but I believe this sensation is exactly what the developers wanted to convey when they made the game, and even recommend playing it in all it's intense difficult glory.

It takes the concept of what a game should be, and throws it out the window. GWBW is thrilling, compelling and intense, with out live first person action. It is increadbly different and fresh. This, however, obvioulsy bothers some people. If you want to play just another game, this isnt the game for you.

It took me a long time to complete this game, not because it was long (it wasn't), or because it was difficult (it was VERY difficult), but because I've been very tired, and this game is not at all "casual"…\n\nThis is the kind of game were EVERY decision may be life-or-death, and even seemingly trivial errors may result in failure. I found this constant pace of decision-making exhausting. Even when you "succeed" (when you complete a chapter), you probably failed to keep everyone alive, or to keep your ethics or morals intact. Taking the high ground is likely to result in EVERYBODY dying…\n\nThe gameplay is pretty simple. It's a point-and-click puzzle game, with most of the puzzles revolving around managing a group of people in various states of pending doom. For example, a hostage situation where you need to carefully manage the hostage's states of mind (if they get TOO upset they'll make a break for it, but if you don't keep them nervous ENOUGH, they'll attempt to overpower you) while simultaneously negotiating with/fighting off their rescuers, while simultaneously hacking a security system. Or researching an vaccine for an alien virus by doing potentially lethal experimentation on your party members while they simultaneously attempt to dig their way out a collapsed cave entrance before everybody suffocates to death.\n\nA very satisfying game, and I'm glad that I played it.","September 11, 2014","true","17.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

People were expecting a very different kind of game and were thus disappointed when the finished game failed to meet their expectations. What initially might seem like a somewhat ordinary point-and-clicker is in reality a complex resource management simulation that could essentially be represented as an array of gauges steadily, or randomly, ticking away or being manipulated in some mystical way by you, the player.\n\nWithout a doubt this will be a huge turn-off for some, perhaps the majority of gamers. Being restricted to seven unforgiving, minimalist survival scenarios might not feel like something anyone in their right mind would enjoy. What I want to convey, though, is that there is a very unique charm to this game, very much unlike anything else out there. The pixel art is stellar. The music, ohh, the music is fantastic indeed. Perhaps most importantly, though, the hopeless atmosphere and the brutality of the story is what appeals to me the most. Having spent twenty minutes lying, begging and enduring pain in a torture chamber, clinging to dear life, the moment when your torturer pulls out a revolver, slides in a singular bullet and spins the cylinder is soul crushing. Every drop of the hammer makes your heart miss a beat because you actually have your all your previous progress through the level at stake. The fact that, in the original mode at least, there is that unforgiving element of pure chance somehow makes every decision have that much more weight.\n\nAgain, this is not for everyone. At this point, I'd suspect you'll already know if something like this is your cup of tea. Even if you're turned off by the randomness or the plain difficulty, I'd still dare recommend this game to most fans of adventure games. With recent patches the difficulty can be toned down, and while I don't suggest you do this if you can avoid it, there is now the possibility to experience the story with less frustration. If you're up for this kind of stuff definitely pick it up. If you're on the fence, I suggest waiting for a sale.","September 13, 2014","true","7.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This game is very difficult and should not be played by those who don't have the patience to replay a stage over and over and over again. The difficulty might be an unattractive part of the game to some but for me and others who love this game it is one of the best parts of this game. This game is about survival, beating the odds, buckling down, making it by the skin of your teeth and how difficult it is to do so. The difficulty beautifully ties itself with the harsh realities of survival as each stage presents itself as an extreme situation where sacrifices must be made and even then in most cases you will lose. But you keep fighting, because thats what it takes, because thats what this game is about, because if it were easy, it wouldn't be worth doing and for those who fight and persevere, they will see the true significance of the story and its themes. And those who quit at the face of failure and difficulty won't, because they don't deserve to, they didn't do what this game demands: to have the will to fight and survive no matter the cost.

It isn't a "fun" game, it's actually quite a stressful game, to the point where at times I simply wanted to stop playing, but I believe this sensation is exactly what the developers wanted to convey when they made the game, and even recommend playing it in all it's intense difficult glory.

Could be described as a tamogotchi with people problems. If the thought of that does not make you cringe on the inside, give this game shot and test your humanity. Personally I was intrigued by the story but was not very happy when I realized that the game is actually pretty short (I got it for the story and, hence, I did not go with the hard mode or the original). I've also noticed that some things are a bit backwards despite the seriousness of the story, and at times it felt like Space Quest was much more involved on the sci-fi theme. If you play the game you will understand certain aspects of socio-economics and technological development are highly under-estimated for space faring characters (when you finish this game you will understand the backwardness).

This game's definition of "point and click thriller" basically means, click one of three options over and over again until you've passed that chapter of the game, and then move onto the next chapter where you can choose between three or more options. Notably, in the second chapter, the gameplay is literally choosing between "provoke, beg, think, lie, and confess" about 10 times each in-game day, for 20 days.\n\nLets just say that I'm glad Steam started offering refunds while my purchase of this game was still valid for it.","June 2, 2015","false","0.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This is easily one of the most frustrating and confusing games I have played in a long while, even in "Narrative Mode," which is supposedly the easiest setting. I tried to give it a fair chance and still intend to finish it, but after wandering around a labyrinthian desert for over 2 hours with no progress, I just don't care enough. And while I'm sure the story starts tying together the further you get, it starts off as a confusing mess of unexplained science fiction jargon while you struggle to figure out exactly what the hell you're supposed to be doing in order to complete the chapter. Characters die and go missing as frequently as you let them, but that doesn't seem to matter since they reappear in subsequent chapters with no explanation as to why. If it weren't for a static visual effect on the dead characters, I would have thought it's a bug.\nGameplay-wise, it's very reminiscent of Oregon Trail. Most of the missions seem to revolve around managing time and resources to keep as many of your crew alive as possible (not that it matters). The bulk of the game involves asking one character about the status of the other characters via drop-down dialog boxes and making decisions based on that, then repeating.\nBut if you've been looking for a game that accurately simulates all the fun of aimlessly wandering around a desert, then knock yourself out.","May 26, 2015","false","6.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I loved it in many diffrent ways. Ended up actually caring about characters, something  that is damn hard to have in a videogame.\n\nPRO'S:\n-Great pixel graphics.\n-Enjoyable soundtrack.\n-Loveable characters such as Irving. Love that guy.\n-Good plot, nothing to massive but it was an objective you tried for.\n-The overall story, why he was there, how he felt, even the title were fantastic. Those gods? yeah you'll figure it out on your own.\n\nCON'S:\n-Difficulty (really opinion based) was higher than expected. I liked it at some parts, and at others I felt furious. How the hell am I supposed to keep two torture victims alive while also keeping their secrets? Other times it felt great, in the desert was the best part of the game for me.\n-Short (NEVAMIND THEY ADDED MORE). Loved the ending but I wanted more.\n-Possibility of having zero loss of crew. I like it when your best friend gets decapitated in front of your very eyes. Adds the feels. Not much of a spoiler, but you can get everyone to survive, even the fat nerd.\n\nTL;DR\nBuy the game if you like story. If not, go play some other non-story based point & click (?).","October 26, 2015","true","9.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I still maintain that this is more interactive fiction than modern game. This isn't something that you're intended to powergame, it's something you're meant to experience. It's about a lot of things, but among the overarching themes is how twisted ethics become when dealing with things like slavery, decadence, and violent retaliation. The game is a meditation on right and wrong, and yet, there is no right or wrong here. I still don't know what the right decision is, after having beaten the game.\n\nI think the game may actually be too smart for a bulk of its audience. The biggest reason I changed my review was because I feel the game could not exist in any other medium. I think what Devolver has done with gaming is what I have always wanted to see done with gaming: Instead of a math simulator where you're min/maxing your orc warrior princess from a distance, you're actively drawn in through various clever hooks, both mechanical and plot-driven. This game overclocks the medium, showing off gaming's unique immersive ability. It is something rarely done in gaming.\n\nFor everyone who is frustrated: Get past the first episode and the game opens up. This is one of those games that needs a little bit of time to turn on. Remember how Fallout 2 was terrible for the first 15 minutes? Remember how Fallout 2 was the best Fallout in the series?\n\nThis game is worth your 10 dollars if you're looking for an immersive, important, and expertly crafted story. If you're just looking for some mindless fun to burn some time, however, this isn't it.\n\nThis isn't a fun game. This is a game that will get under your skin. It's uncomfortable, but the discomfort, you'll realize, is necessary for it to tell its story.\n\n~~below is the old review. It's how you will feel at first with the game, before you realize what it's actually trying to accomplish. I don't think this does the game justice.~~\n\nGWBW has one of the better stories you'll run across in gaming. It's actually pretty rare to run across a story this good. It completely gets away from the typical binary of good and bad and right and wrong. It's not an ethics puzzle game as advertised, however. The game falls short in the gameplay. It essentially boils down to a resource management game that punishes the player for a misstep in the same way that an old Sierra adventure game might (I'm looking at you, Space Quest 4). Remember those old platformers from the early 90's where you had to play a level like 100 times over to figure out how to beat it? That's what this is like, except instead of jumping puzzles you're clicking through dialog and making people eat or sleep.\n\nHaving to restart from scratch and waste 15 minutes of playtime is annoying, and however well this mechanic is worked into the story (no spoilers), it just ends up being an obvious method of extending the game's length. This is another problem: While there is some replayability, the game is extremely short, and your choices end up having little impact on the end. Yes, your choices impact the story as it's going along, but ultimately the ending is a self-contained minigame that ends up being really boring. I'm not sure how I feel about this. Something makes me want more closure regarding the choices I made with my team. You do get some impactful moments based on your decisions that are written into the story, depending on how you behaved, but again, no spoilers.\n\nThe game aims to make your choices harder and more meaningful, and to put stress on the player as if the player were right there with the characters. I can respect this. The problem is that this turns into a horrible grindfest devoid of all fun. If they had included a checkpoint system or shortened the vignettes by about half, they would have made an excellent game. As it stands, it's just extremely frustrating to play, and if they had shortened the grindier parts, the game would have taken like four hours to beat.\n\nI wanted to like this game. In fact, I DO like this game. I want to say that I love this game, but I don't love it as a game. I love it as an interactive story. I wish steam had more than a yes or no voting system, because if you're looking for a really amazing short story with beautiful graphics and music, you must buy this. If, however, you're looking for a game with fun mechanics, you need to pass this up. The grinding just absolutely kills it.\n\nWait for a sale. I think it's worth 10 dollars, but then I found the story really meaningful.","July 25, 2014","true","11.9"," 7 of 16 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","7","16","0","0"

In addition one of the sets of decisions in that second mission has an amount of at least partially unavoidable RNG involved midway through that can immediately kill you and reset the mission, wasting about 10-20 minutes of play time.\n\nIt's a really cool concept for a game and there ARE parts of it that make you agonize over your decisions but I wouldn't recommend it to most people- play the demo on their site and if you REALLY enjoy it then go ahead and get it once the 5th mission patch comes out.  You'll probably still be disappointed by a few parts of it but the experience of the good chunks will hopefully outweigh the bad ones.  If you're not convinced by the demo then don't buy it, as the full game doesn't do enough to make several of the various missions they've made match the tension and tough decisions of the demo.","July 28, 2014","false","12.6"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","4","10","0","0"

The game is just challenging enough to keep the game's (intentional) "repetitiveness" from ever getting boring. The Steam reviews saying this game is absurdly difficult are completely false, I played the game through in almost six hours on normal in my first playthrough. The story is filled with interesting characters and if you connect the pieces of the puzzle of dialogue and characters together throughout the story your mind will be busy trying to fill in the gaps throughout the whole game. I highly recommend this game to anyone and everyone for the gameplay, mechanics, level design, story, and characters are all superbly executed. My only issue with the game was how no matter what the outcome of the prior mission(s) was, the next mission would play out the same. However, allow me to tell you that if you put aside that complaint until later in the game you may no longer find it to be a complaint; that depends on your interpretation of the story and I can see the argument either way. I hope to see more games of this quality out of Deconstructeam in the future.","August 1, 2014","true","5.9"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

Burden's eyes, it is meant to be a story that you give to experience.\n\nTo the people who tell you the game is bad because it is luck based, just ignore them, this game is based around percentage chance. This makes it both frustrating and rewarding.  For example, in one chapter, a man will draw a gun on you and demand information, there is nothing you can do that won't negatively effect you to stop him from shooting, he has 1 shot in a 7 shot reolver, and it is 100% luck, some might call that bad, but I call it exciting\n\nIs the game worth $9.99? That is 100% up to you. If you enjoy a good story and a nice challenge, I highly suggest you get this game, of course there are many other $9.99 games you could get instead, but it is just preference.","July 28, 2014","true","1.8"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

There's a ton of bad reviews out there right now, but I think it mostly stems from a disconnect between what people were expecting and what the game is. If you know what you're buying, I think it's a pretty neat little experience. Here's what it is:\n\nYou play through 6 different scenarios in which you're shoved into tense life-or-death situations. Normal Mode is extremely hard, while Easy mode is....Well, it's significantly easier but still challenging in a few parts. The situations are basically all about resource management, but in a clever way. You're managing health, sanity, food, party members, etc...\n\nThe Good:\n-The situations are difficult and even when you win a chapter you'll nearly always find yourself barely surviving.\n\n-The story is pretty interesting. There's some twists but it's overall a pretty simple scifi story.\n\n-I enjoyed the art and the music. It's a little subjective, of course, but I think it's well done.\n\n-I played the game on easy mode, and it look me 8 hours. For a game that only costs $10, I feel that's a great length. But I know some people expect a longer game, so I'm noting it here. I imagine that playing on normal will take significantly longer due to more repetition. Additionally, there's some replay value because you'll want to try the game again on normal mode (if you played it in easy originally) and you'll want to see if you can survive using different techniques.\n\nThe Bad:\n\n-There are definitely some parts of the game where randomness is a big factor. There's one scene with Russian roulette that plays out exactly like you'd expect- Basically you've got a 1 in 7 chance that you die immediately. There's a few other parts of the game where randomness is a factor but not nearly as bad (For example, randomness will determine which resources you find in a later chapter. You can conserve the resources and manage them carefully to boost your chances, but if you don't find anything for too long there's ultimately nothing you can do).\n\n- No checkpoints. If you fail one chapter, you need to start the entire thing all over again. It's not a big deal for some of the shorter chapters, but some of them take closer to an hour to complete. This can make the deaths due to factors which feel out of your control much more frustrating. Additionally, there's no way to save mid-chapter. So if you need to take a break, you'll need to start the whole chapter over again.\n\n-Decisions do not carry over from chapter to chapter. It's probably for the better in my opinion, since loosing certain characters early on would basically make later chapters impossible. But I know some people expected this, so I'm noting it here.\n\n\nAll in all, I enjoyed the game. It's a short experience with appealing art and music that challenges you in some interesting ways. It's not a grand adventure with moral dilemmas and far-reaching consequences. A few random elements and the inability to save inside a chapter hurt the experience, but I still feel it's worth the price of admission as long as that's what you're looking for.","July 27, 2014","true","9.2"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

Even when you try to find some rhyme to the games logic it will change the rules on you. For example it the beginning you need to keep some enemies at bay, if they get too close they lob a grenade it at'cha....despite the 4 hostages RIGHT THERE. Well silly me, I thought that when they reached the door they'd do it, and in 3 tries, they did...so I learned, keep them away from the door, but then, 75% through hacking with hostages still left, they decided to lob one in from halfway down the hallway.

If you screw up and take a bullet in the head, game over for good. For my money this game has broken new ground in very cool ways. If you can make it to the end and have an open mind I can't see you at the *very* least finding this was well worth $10. In my case I see a really cool, (mostly) unexplored area of games. Yeah it won't appeal to everyone, but the people that latch on to this REALLY latch onto it.\n\nAfter playing the game through a good 3 or 4 times the storyline makes SO much more sense even right from the get-go. It basically starts to form a coherent timeline because the infinite restarts, skipping to different scenarios etc just sort of fit into the universe they've written.\n\nIt's a very well written "Stressful Scenario" game that tells a pretty great story, has some awesome music and art, and some really memorable characters. It suffers from some admittedly serious bugs (which have been/are currently being fixed), and the marketing should have been more specific. They haven't said anything wrong about the game in the advertising, but it's such a new type of game that they could have been more specific and mentioned the resource management aspect in a bigger way.\n\nHopefully that's a fair assessment. Suffice to say I thought the ending was great, although the road (narratively speaking) is bumpy on the way to the resolution until it makes sense. Maybe bumpier than it could have been\n\n8/10","July 31, 2014","true","25.1"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

But I feel it's getting a lot of unecessary flak. One thing it isn't is random, or trial and error. Although clearly you are likely to fail numerous times before finding a solution, that's not the same thing.\n\nWithout spoiling anything, for the most part you are put in charge of controlling a group in some kind of life or death situation. The key thing is that most of the situations you're in are actually quite deterministic. While there are some random events of differing flavors throughout the various chapters, if you know how the mechanics of the situation work they are generally not a real threat.\n\nAll of the chapters are unique while still sticking to the basic outline. For me, the heart of the game is figuring out how these different systems work. You are thrown into completely disparate(sic) scenarios, from a data heist to managing a research team. Each situation, however grimdark, ultimately operates on a set of rules that can be understood. Ultimately, you are in control of everything that happens.","July 27, 2014","true","36.6"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

On the first stage, you will have to handle an hostage situation as the hostage tacker: downloading some data on a computer while maintaining the server security, keeping an eye on four hostages and keeping guards away.\nSeems Interesting at first, but the gameplay is ♥♥♥♥. There is no way to know what to do whith the hostages, as their mood is indicated by pixel art animation (rocking swiftly, rocking rapidly, rocking slightly faster or moving their head) and doesn't tell you if you should calm them down or shout at them while breaking their kneecaps.\nEvry time you click on something, the situation goes on. The problem is there is so much stuff to do that you simply can't handle everything at once. Your hostages will start to run like hell because you couldn't tell "scratching it's butt" meant you had to breack his kneecap or sending him to another room, the swat team will rush to your position whether you try to negociate to them or shoot...\n\nI suspect a dumb RNG running in the background. I couldn't find a single dude who was able to pass this first level without looking on youtube how to do it.\n\nI love hard games, die and retry, mind challenging games or games that punish you when you make one loody mistake, but in this one you don't even know what was a mistake, why, and if this exact same option will be a mistake or a good thing on your next try. I guess the dev team didn't take the time to ask themselves "Hey, will people who didn't code the game understand anything to our gamplay", but quickly changed subject to "what shade of blue should I put on my pixel art".\n\nDon't buy this crap. I heard the story was awesome, so juste look at it on youtube, but don't even try to play it. It's just frustrating and really, really badly designed. The dev team as a real artistic talent, but they are not game designers.","November 22, 2015","false","0.6"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","2"

I didn't play much, but found the experience so unrewarding that I almost feel like I'd be suffering if I were to pick it up again and had no desire to use a guide.\n\nAfter a lengthy intro you are dumped in this hostage taking situation. You're given almost no cues. Stuff just happens. It is a trial and error type affair, but that's just not fun. Clicking different things and getting no feedback just doesn't do anything for me. You have a guy stood at a box watching the guards, but no feedback from him. You have to prompt him but for what? You give him orders but you get no feedback on what said orders have accomplished. Either the guards come or they don't, I guess. Then you get to try again. It's all a bit... "figure out this scenario... but we won't give you hints."\n\nAfter losing 5 or 6 times I quickly decided this game wasn't for me. It's not the losing - hell, one of my favourite games is 'Iter Vehemens ad Necem' - but the lack of any clues or useful feedback on the gameplay. I think the issue is, if they were to include that kind of thing then the game would be over too quickly because the scenarios probably boil down to quite simplistic number games of cat and mouse. So they extend the gameplay by making you guess until you hit the right combination to survive the scenario. I guess that's no fun for me.","January 9, 2015","false","0.2"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

It's difficult without being engaging... When you fail you go back to the beginning of a chapter, forcing you to repeat/rethink your steps all over again. It's simply not fun. You can play with reduced difficulty, but ultimately it's a lot of the same. You'll make it a little further, but a misstep will send you back.

For instance, I got rather attached to Jack in a bros-to-the-end kind of fashion.\nMoral Choices?\nOnly if you care about what's going on in the story and the game, or if you care about the characters.\nFor instance, in the classic level, you're faced with surviving in a hostile environment, but hunger is at an all time high. Do you carry on trying to survive, clinging onto any form of hope, or do you succumb to cannibalism, or even eat your own dog?\nIn another example (since people seemed to disagree), a soldier has a disability of having one leg and is slowing down the group significantly - Do the best for the group and put him down? Or fight on?\n\nWhen I saw this game originally, I was absolutely amazed and didn't hesitate to buy it. Needless to say, I wasn't disappointed. It's an absolute beautiful, stressing, harsh and great experience, all at once. You play as Sgt Burden a hardened war hero known as a legend amongst his own, and you are faced with many survival situations - From taking a lead role in a hostage situation, to being tortured, or having to survive the harsh wilderness, moral choice over well being of yourself takes a lead role in this charming, pixelated art style game. Will you shoot the hostage in the leg to scare the others? will you fire at the guards to make them back up? Will you force on the suffering and possibly death of your friend so that you may live?\n\nGods Will Be Watching presents itself in a very good way, in a way that can be understood quickly, as long as you pay attention, I understood the gameplay mechanics very easily and found myself very quickly addicted to it. I was kind of shocked to see the amount of negative reviews this game got, so I knew I had to post this review to spread the truth of this.","August 22, 2014","true","7.2"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

The best advice I can give is: Know what you're getting into! Play the demo here http://www.deconstructeam.com/gods-will-be-watching/.\nThe full game is just an extension of the demo, more levels, more story, the same gameplay. I don't know why people are expecting it to be different.\n\nThis is a tough game. It's not a fun game, it's a game about putting you in soul crushingly bleak situations and making you watch as your team members slowly deteriorate and die, but if you manage your actions right they just might make it through. Everyone is counting you. When someone dies, it’s all on you. When everyone dies, it’s all on you. And when you make it, that's all because of you too.\n\nThis is a puzzle game. Puzzle games can be frustrating. You can play a level for an hour and fail at the last hurdle, but you know it can be done, so you try again. There are some random elements which can't be controlled and occasionally end your playthrough without warning, but that adds to the tension. Sure, it's a game you will get frustrated with and leave, but you will keep coming back.\n\nDo not expect to get through it in one sitting. Do not play on easy.

The game feels so rewarding after you finished it and outweights the frustration you get when you failed in a chapter a lot. I won't tell anymore about this game because I want to avoid spoilers but if you got a high tolerance limit and you are sure that you will clear all 7 chapters it is worth a buy.

Moraliti is an issue indeed in this game but not because of it's choiches, but because you are bounded to hars decisions. To me it puts a moral question as well: when a decision is way much bigger than you, should you care at all?\n\nThe bad: The very issue of this game is that sometimes you are clueless that you are going to die. To reach the point where you died will take lots of time, this is boring and frustrating as repeating doesn't mean making something different (like in FTL), it means just repeating.\n\nThe good: It may challenge your ethic and feelings as you will have to manage people like resources as this is the way the game rappresents the crude world of Gods Will Be Watching.

Game can be completed in less than 5 hours and thus the only reason I could $10 for it is because that's how much it would have cost to rent it at a blockbuster and that's all you should do with this game. Rent it.  I feel bad for the people who bought the collector's edition.\n\n\n\n\nThe game's major selling point is the story, which was moderately interesting, I'll give it that. But again, for $10 you could just buy a book and get something highly interesting instead. The game doesn't really feel like a game so much as a way to facilitate the story, and the story is not worth $10.\n\nI mean, don't get me wrong, if you're rich and have money to spare go for it. Buy it and play it and forget about it cuz $10 is a drop in the bucket to you, but the average person has no business spending $10 on this when they could get so much more out of something else for the same price.\n\nBiggest reason for my negative review is incoming, with MAJOR SPOILER ALERT IF YOU CONTINUE READING.\n\nSo. Yeah it was an alright story. Alright. Not great, not amazing, not compelling, it was alright. And then at the end they went and poopoo'd on your parade by taking the literary suicide copout of "It was all just a dream."  ... It wasn't a dream, but every time you die in game your character ACTUALLY dies canonically in the story. Your death is PART of the story, restarting is PART of the story.  Because the main character is stuck in a time loop.\n\nEver see that movie with Tom Cruise where he gets infected by some alien thing and resets to a save point every time he dies?  Don't. It's bad.   But that's basically what's happening here.\n\nThe main character has to relive every event between point A and point B every time he dies, always starting at A.\n\nAt the "end" of the game you jump in a black hole and go back in time and also infect yourself with... some sort of.. timey wimey disease that was really not elaborated on at all.\n\nso the end of the game is just a "it was all just a dream/recurrence" copout. Your decisions in the game have no impact whatsoever, no matter what you do the main character is going to go through the exact same sequence of events over and over, sometimes dying earlier (like when you were struggling on first mission) sometimes making it to the end of the full circuit (like when you beat the game and jump in the wormhole.)\n\n\nIn summation, the story uses a literary tool which equates to "and it was all just a dream" at the very end of the story. This invalidates the story. The story is about 85% of the selling point of this "game" (I'd argue it's more of a choose your own adventure story than a game) ...   So the ending invalidates 85% of this "game" entirely.\n\n$10 for a story that is invalidated by its ending.  I'm really glad I got this one on sale. I don't understand how it got such positive reviews.\n\nGood day.","December 21, 2015","false","3.7"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

The difficulty level is so jacked up, the requirements so specific, that the player is forced to resort to walkthrough to simply advance in the game, with no room for creativity or discovery on the part of the player.\n\nAdd to that overwrought political dialog, and unnecessary and combersome ploy developments, this thing just doesn't work. I hope the devs will continue forward, and make something playable, because I think there was an interesting an idea at the core of this one.\n\nYour mileage might very, but I would recommend against.","June 13, 2015","false","0.3"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Moraliti is an issue indeed in this game but not because of it's choiches, but because you are bounded to hars decisions. To me it puts a moral question as well: when a decision is way much bigger than you, should you care at all?\n\nThe bad: The very issue of this game is that sometimes you are clueless that you are going to die. To reach the point where you died will take lots of time, this is boring and frustrating as repeating doesn't mean making something different (like in FTL), it means just repeating.\n\nThe good: It may challenge your ethic and feelings as you will have to manage people like resources as this is the way the game rappresents the crude world of Gods Will Be Watching. If it wasn't for the above issues, this game would be one of the best experiences I had in gaming.

Although the game is not a proper adventure considered each level consists in not more than one to three screens, is as repetitive as any other point and click game. the difference lays in the need of managing the "resources" to overcome every challenge and more often than not survive the situation your characters will be thrown into.\n\nGameplaywise the point and click is just what the developers decided fits best as a way to interact with the game and this is as far as the relation between this title and the point and click genre goes.\n\nRegarding the narrative, it is really solid and I assure it will hook your chin and stick it in front of the screen as soon as you manage to pass the first level. And you will find yourself bonded to your comrades or your mission depending on who you are and how you feel you want to leave your mark in this thrilling story.\n\nFailure is not an option, it is a certainty and you will have to try a bit hard to proceed through the game. But there is not only one good way to complete each level. You will find yourself struggle to decide if it is acceptable the way the events unfold according to your decision making or if a rerun of a given level is needed. To sooth the tension the authors provided a nice recap of your performance after each chapter in form of a statistic comparison of your choiches with the other players in the world over time.\n\nOn top of that there are beautifully designed pixel art, a matching soundtrack and the need to know, right after the first failure, how your main character  managed to find himself lost in the desert. (NOT A SPOILER, play it and you'll know what I mean)\n\nIn a few words the game is what it claims to be. A minimalistic survival thriller wrapped in a DERIVED FORM of the classic point and click gameplay. For all those who cannot figure out how it works from the various reviews posted here and there, I suggest to visit the official site where the original version of this game is freely playable from your browser:\nhttp://www.deconstructeam.com/games/gods-will-be-watching/\n\nthis will help you to get a feel of the gameplay and atmosphere but is nothing like the full game.\nP.S.\nI never did beat the browser game....I tried, god knows I tried...","July 29, 2014","true","9.2"," 6 of 15 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","6","15","0","0"

Honestly, this is a beautiful game in my opinion. It partially relies on luck, but it's also based on what you choose. Example: High percentage of this happening, then it probably will happen.. I've had things fail on me before at a 90% success rate. :( That's just unlucky, but still very fun.\n\nIt's a very fun game because there's so many different things you CAN do. So many options to browse, and you have to think these things out carefully to progress. The beginning might be a bit tedious because it's where you learn everything, and pick up on the mechanics. It throws you straight into the game without instructions, so you might have to bear with that.\n\nIt is a beautiful game due to the soundtrack and art style. It's a great point and click adventure game with an interesting story as well. :D\n\nIf you have the patience to play a game, an interest in the art + style + story + soundtrack, then sure.

This isnt a cute visual novel where you make choices and sometimes bad things happen. This is a time and recource managment game thats thick with story and character. If that's not your cup of tea, turn around now.\n\nAs for the difficultly, yes, it is very VERY hard. I never even beat the demo. I played the first chapter on Original difficulty (there are two difficulties: Original and Easy). After failing 5 times I switched to Easy. Easy isn't exactly easy, but it tones down the difficulty enough that it's beatable to me. It's still difficult, mind you, but not EXTREME MEGA DIFFICULTY OF DEATH.\nI do see the complaints about the artifical difficulty that comes with the exessive use of chance and sometimes unfair luck. This game uses percentages and chance a lot, which often times ends up with the feeling of unfairness. 1-7 chance of being shot BAM DEAD. 82% chance you'll suceed HAHA FAILED. It can get frustrating, and I felt some segments were unfair (a.i the randomly generated desert in Ch.5 that can lead you into a dead end and screw you over), but it didn't ruin the game for me. It also added a bit on tension. I really did start praying to the so called Gods of the game during the russian roulette segment.\n\nThe story and characters are great. You can really feel their delema and start to maybe care for them. Even if you don't feel an emotional attachment to the characters and their plight, you do become attached to them due to the fact you NEED them and their set of skills. I don't like Donald, but I need him to repair the robot after the poor guy damages himself charging the batteries. If Donald, if ANYONE dies, the game gets significantly harder. Everyone is useful\n\nThis game is tense and unforgiving and mean, but its a hell of a ride and the story and characters are great.

Original mode is balls-out hard; pure and simple. It is harsh, brutal, and unforgiving; an apt description of the game at large as well. However, it is very thoughtful and stressful, every decision having consequences both immediate and delayed. I feel that maybe people were offput, thinking it a similar game to Superbrothers' Sword and Sworcery (another phenomenal game I highly recommend), but it is not a simple game like that was; you must manage everything on screen, or failure WILL occur. Once again, I feel this is actually a strong plus, going in the vein that your choices ultimately culminate, for ill or good. Another thing I can see rubbing people the wrong way is that the game gives you zero insight into what to do. It does not tell you what to do with hostages, how they're doing, etc. You have to watch their demeanor, their way of speaking and tone of voice, etc. Once again, this is not an easy game by any means, but It does make you think if you are making the correct decisions, and whether you could have done something different. Granted, I have only passed the first chapter as of this writing (after changing it to easy, admittedly), but so far I am eager to see what else happens.","July 25, 2014","true","1.0"," 4 of 11 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","4","11","0","0"

I am no robot or super human just a normal player, and saying this game is not that difficult, they are just used to ( MASH BUTTONS TO WIN! ) ... bleh\n\nI am sorry if my review offended you, i just think this game is too great to have all those negative reviews PILING and Upcoming buyers will decide not to buy it because of them\n(Posting saying DO NOT BUY BECAUSE I SUCK AT IT MAYBE YOU WILL ) is nonsense....\nAnd apparently the amount of haters in this game decided to Upvote all the negative reviews and Downvote all the positive ones and now its filled with negative reviews on the store page only ...","July 24, 2014","true","14.4"," 22 of 48 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","22","48","0","0"

Except for the first level,\nI've beaten every chapter in one or two tries in "Original" difficulty.\nEvery chapter I played with the actions you can do to examine their effects.\nI talked with NPCs to get necessary information.\nAfter 5 minutes of learning the mechanics of the level,\nI tried to pass it for real. I took my time and didn't rush,\nand checked my status all the time. RNG is really minor.\nIf you're just interested in the story and want to have an easy and very forgiving gameplay,\ndon't buy this game. There should be a "super easy" mode for this reason.\nIf you love epic music, artstyle, cool story,\nthinking and leading a tough sitoations leader then this game is for you.\n\nHere is my personal information about the game:\n\nMusic: 10/10. Epic.\nArt style:  9/10. Very appealing (for me), but there is a bit of not so good art from time to time.\nGameplay: 8/10. It feels very solid, but it is anoying going though wall of texts when you die and do everything again (it depends on the level though).\nStory: 9/10. very interesting, but it leaves taste for me. hopefully in the DLC.\n\nPROS:\n\n- Music, art, story.\n- Every level (there are 7) is diffrent and is giving you fresh experience.\n- Not short, will take you at least 10 hours in Original mode to complete.\n\nCONS:\n\n- You have to go through walls of texts every time you die,\nand sometimes reapeat your actions too.\n- Too many people ♥♥♥♥♥ing about it^.\n\nGive this game some love.

Everything in the trailer tells me that this will be pixelated fun like Maniac Mansion and it will be hard like Dark Souls and I'll have to figure out the method to win every level like Dark Souls or The Fall. After playing this game I realize that is exactly what I got.\n\nYes, the game is hard. They will not spoon feed you the answers like so many point and click adventures. You have to figure out each chapter’s puzzle, which are different. Refreshingly different in fact, as there is little information you can take from one chapter to the next that will help you. I played the first chapter 10 times, before I understood I would need to stop trying to brute force my decisions and really think about each action I was taking. Once I figured that out I breezed through the remaining chapters, several of which I beat first try. And that is the secret to every chapter. Make every action count. I had to pull out my trusty notepad and map out a level, or jot down reactions to my actions on a first run through. I made sure to take every opportunity to take free actions that gave me more information about my situation.\n\nGods Will Be Watching is a refreshing change of pace that gives expert gamers a run for their money and forces you to learn how to play the game wel. If you are easily frustrated when you lose, then this game is not for you. Although if frustration and restarting a level emboldens you and forces you to become a better player, then this is one of the few games out there that does just that.\n\n- ChronoKitty","July 27, 2014","true","8.6"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","3","9","0","0"

I'm a fan of narrative-driven games, and this one looked very promising.\nHowever, the "normal" mode kills it. Completely.\nAnd anyone who says the game is not luck-based is wrong; my first try of my first load of the game, I get the quintessential "game over" screen without having done a single thing (The data was blocked/corrupted). How can I lose a game without having even played it? A failure state is a requirement for a game, but interaction to achieve said failure state is also pretty much a given.\n\nI restarted the game in "light" mode, taking away the "chance" mechanic (come on guys, even the developer says it's based on chance...). Even then, mechanics are uneven and the game is extremely unforgiving. Rules change every level... I made it to level 3, but then, I wondered "What's the point?".\nI will most likely restart the game in narrative mode, so I can experience the story... because that's what drove me to this game in the first place.\n\nThe first game from Devolver Digital that I played, Always Sometimes Monsters, was amazing. It gave me great hopes for this game, being by the same guys essentially. But quickly, I found out that it wasn't what I thought it would be. And I was unfortunately disappointed (I've been happily surprised before with a few games...).\n\nAll in all, if you like games of chance or rogue-likes (like FTL, which is superior but still not for me), it'll be right up your alley.\nIf you are looking for a good narrative, it might be your thing.\nIf you are looking for a game of pure skill, pass.\n\nAll I know is that it's not for me.","October 25, 2014","false","0.8"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

There are different paths to win, and they are often moral choices, but not in a manichean way. In "the walking dead" or "mass effect" you have three buttons, "good", "bad", "neutral"; Here you got some better options in order to win, and some useless ones, but it's not really clear. It's more complex, it's strategy. I like that. This game speaks about morality in a more mature and realistic way. I can see why you don't like it: it's difficult, it's different, uses frustration as part of the game. Ok, those expecting for a "telltale-casual-style" will be disappointed.

I liked everything that I heard and read about this game. The dark sci-fi setting, the decision-based point and click, the intense and dramatic music...and then I started playing. I figured, I'm a decent gamer, I'll try it on "original" difficulty. After twelve tries on the first task I gave up and switched to "easy" difficulty, figuring that I was much more interested in the storyline than the gameplay anyway. After six more tries on "easy" I finally made it through the first chapter. I was then introduced to chapter 2, where my character is being interrogated in violent fashion, I was soon informed that I would be performing the same torture sequence TWENTY TIMES! The game actually tells you that you have to survive, performing the same repetitive task, TWENTY TIMES in a row, each one taking about two minutes. And screw up once, you get to go back and do it all over again. The original writing wears itself out once you've read it four times, and can look forward to doing it two dozen more times before you get it right. I understand the idea of a game with consequences or where your character can die forcing you to try again, but the whole premise of this game is try the same task over and over and over and over again. Even on EASY DIFFICULTY. My patience wore out, having not even finished chapter two. This is a complete waste of money, do not buy this game unless you enjoy the idea of performing the same tedious thing over and over and over and over again. This game will appeal to the same kind of people that enjoy going to the dentist for a root canal. I seriously cannot stress enough how awful a game experience this "game" provides. If you're intrigued by the story, and I know that I was before playing it, then go on youtube and watch someone else play through the game for the story, then come back and thank me for sparing you the aggravation of actually dealing with this game.

But I can already tell my experience in Gods Will Be Watching will not be getting very different as the chapters progress.\n\nI think this game is interesting to say the least, but it's story and gameplay mechanics are poorly executed and do not go hand-in-hand with eachother. I thought that the purpose of the game was to face me with moral issues, and what consequences my actions would lead to. It turns out, Gods Will Be Watching is a time management game which bascially says "get this done in this many days" or "do this as fast as you can without killing anyone"\n\nAnd boy, is this game  frustrating.  Whilst the constant failures do make the game more life like it strips any entertainment there is to be found. My actions don't have any long term consequences either. You ♥♥♥♥ up, you have to start again. That's it. Nothing in the long run that will remind me of that terrible choice I made to shoot that hostage in the face. If I did shoot that poor fella in the head, I get told that was the wrong thing to do and I need to start alll over again. That ain't fun.\n\nBut I must admit, this game isn't neccesarily  bad  either. As far as visuals go, this game looks  fantastic.  Quite possibly the best I have seen for a while, you can really tell that alot of effort went into this game.\n\n\nAll in all, whilst Gods Will Be Watching offers a fine concept and interesting story to go with it it really does need quite the fine tuning before it will be satisfying to play.\n\n+ Stunning visuals\n+ Interesting nartative\n\n- Poorly executed game play\n- Really no fun at all\n\n7/10","July 25, 2014","true","1.5"," 7 of 19 people (37%) found this review helpful","37","7","19","0","2"

The levels are extremely challenging; those with flimsy patience should steer clear, as Gods Will Be Watching takes a very old-school approach when it comes to your success.  Your success in this game will be earned, my friend, or you won't get to taste it at all.  Believe me, though, success in this game tastes delicious.  Delicious.\n\nRewards for advancing through the levels include experiencing more of the very-well-done story, pieces of concept art, and alternate music for the stages.  I found (and am still finding) that just seeing what happens next is reason enough to keep driving forward.  Feeling like an absolute boss when clearing a stage helps as well.\n\nThere are some parts within the scenarios where choosing the wisest course of action comes with a percentage of success.  In all cases but one, this percentage can be boosted up to 100 before being used, if one is playing well enough.  One fibbly gripe I have with the game is the one situation I've encountered where you can't perfectly ensure success (there is a 1 in 7 chance of failure at best), and I was unlucky twice in a row.  Pretty mean trick there, but honestly, playing the level 12 times instead of 10 or 11 isn't the end of the world.\n\nEngaging story, a mighty fine soundtrack, and the game is very pretty - these things add to the fantastic feeling of accomplishment when you beat something, and the interesting story rounds out a fun, unique video game.  Just be sure to bring your man pants; this game will beat you worse than you'll beat your hostages.","July 25, 2014","true","20.5"," 4 of 13 people (31%) found this review helpful","31","4","13","0","0"

I still haven't ever passed the demo and for the last 2 hours still haven't passed the first level. But I did set it to original which is understandably harder. I got often right to the edge of passing the first level when I assume on easy mode I would have long been finished with it. I agree it's not for everyone but if you enjoy a challenge and oddly it's like that frustrating flappy birds kind of challenge yet involves brain power then I think it's a fun game. I don't expect myself to be giving up on this nor resorting to easy mode. I figure given time and experience the visual cues, the comments people make and all the other clues will begin to become second nature to me and will make the game more enjoyable.

The game is split into chapters and each chapter gives you a different situation, with a different goal and different factors to consider when making decisions. The first chapter, for example, requires you to survive long enough to hack into a computer system, while keeping your hostages calm (making sure you have at least 1 that is alive and in the main room) and dealing with guards outside that are usually creeping closer and closer to the room.\n\nMy favourite chapters are the ones where you had a lot of different actions you could choose from. The complexity of these chapters is overwhelming at first, but this is by design. You will likely fail each chapter the first time you play it and feel irritated because there just isn't a clear path forward; there are too many options to wrap your head around. But each time you play you learn a little more and when you retry it will be slightly easier. Eventually, you can solve a chapter reasonably easily, because you understand all the pieces of the chapter and how they work. It is very rewarding and the lack of checkpoints, which can seem irritating when you first start a chapter, turns out to be a great decision, as you guessing your way from checkpoint to checkpoint wouldn't feel like much of an achievement. They really aren't necessary once you learn the chapter.\n\nAny complaint I can think up really doesn't detract much from the game and for its price there's nothing that should disuade you from getting it, if it sounds like the sort of game you would like.\n\nIf you think this sounds like your sort of game, but still aren't completely sure, check out the link to Polygon's attempt at level 1 at the top of this review!","July 26, 2014","true","12.0"," 2 of 9 people (22%) found this review helpful","22","2","9","0","0"

It's really really cool. The game is reeeally intense and unforgiving.\n\nhttp://youtu.be/kHeq2oxXjFU\nInitially I was overwhelmed by what was going on in the first situation and to really get an idea of what to do. And like they warn you when you choose regular difficulty, I failed a lot! You would think this would become frustrating. But it hasn’t it just made the more nerveracking.  Playing this game is like navigating a minefield, making one wrong step means disaster. One too many mistakes at any point spells complete failure, in some situations I found that you can only afford a single error and that you're dead if your ♥♥♥♥ up again. Decisions that mean the difference between life and death and just success or failure in making it to the next decision are relentless. Not only that, you also must pay attention to multiple situations in a given scenario, you can't neglect any of them. It's delicate balancing act. I can barely comprehend success in this game being possible on regular difficulty. After failing the first chapter at least 5 times or so I went back and put it on easy and made it to the second situation. Even on easy difficulty I was having a hard time not repeatedly failing and having to start the chapter again from the start. After a few attempts I made it to like the third day and was stunned to be told I need to keep my characters who are undergoing torture alive without giving away too much intelligence for 20 days! I made it to the part where the protagonist is strapped to the torture wall. But I pushed it just one little bit too far and he was instantly dismembered.\n\nThe game looks very good. The sound and music is well done. The suspense, horror and the brutality of the situations is conveyed really well. The developers weren't afraid to illustrate extreme brutality. For instance a hot iron shoved into your character crotch. You will be in contant fear of some really nasty things happening to your characters and bad situation going beyond critical. I grimaced when my character was taking a hammer to the knee and I gasped when he was suddenly ripped in half. I haven't gotten to the part where you have characters sitting around in the wilderness eating steaks. But I have a bad feeling about where that meat comes from!\n\nSo, yes I recommend this game. Initially intitially I had a feeling that because there are only 6 chapter it would be short title. I haven't completed it yet. But just getting to end of a chapter is long and arduous. I'm pretty sure the challenge can keep you occupied for quite some time and it's really exciting to play pretty much the whole time.\n\nClick here for more let’s play videos =)","July 24, 2014","true","1.5"," 6 of 18 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","6","18","0","0"

The art style is vary cool (If a little over used nower days). The drama and dilemmas feel real and well written....but, even when the game is ment to give you a feeling of controle to a extent over the situation it really feels like "If I dont do this at this point I wont pass this part". So in turn you feel like your being forced to do a trial and error method of play to finish a mission, this is not fun and you end up feeling exactly that, some one playing trail and error, I understand that this is sort of what they wanted to do with the game but it takes the fun out of the game all together, who ever came up with this idea should not have a say in the design of a game. Granted visual cues help with each situation but with the game giving you freedom to make choices and basicly advertising itself as a choice making game I feel vary pigeonholed. Selecting the right things to do at the right time is not giving the player a freedom or choice. I just dont feel the freedom that I should feel in a game like this. That being said the idea, the design of the game, is amazing! the script is good and feels credible. The characters are grate and you do get a attachment to them, for better or worse.\n\nI'll recommend this game, the characters and story along with the idea are enough to get it over the line. But as I said, for a game that promotes itself as giving the player choise, I feel pigeonholed to get a successfull outcome to a mission.\n\n6/10","July 25, 2014","true","0.2"," 4 of 14 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","4","14","0","0"

These are my two cents about this issue.\n\nFirst of all, I'll have to say that I backed Gods will Be Watching campaing on Indiegogo, and I did it after playing the web browser demo Deconstructeam developed for Ludum Dare. I really fell in love with the game. Loved the art style, the atmosphere, and the combination of resource management and moral choices (not in narrative terms, as the Telltalle interactive dramas, but in terms of survival simulation).\n\nAnd last but not least, I really enjoyed how DIFFICULT it was.\n\nWhat was I expecting of the complete game? More or less, the same interactive experience I really enjoyed in the Ludum Dare version.\n\nWhat I wasn't expecting? A deep, intrincate narrative experience, full of plot-twists, dialogs, and Renegade/Paragon choices. And, honestly, I've would've been dissapointed if they had changed the game I backed into some sort of interactive drama. Don't get me wrong, I love Telltalle Games, but this is not what GWBW is.\n\nSurvival Simulation + Resource Management + Sci-fi + Opressive atmosphere + Retro pixel art = Gods Will Be Watching. And I knew it beforehand because, as I've said before, I played the Ludum Dare version months ago. I liked it. I backed it. I wanted to see GBWB become a full game. And after a few hours playing, that's what I've got.\n\nI know that the trailer might lead to make people believe this game is an interactive drama, but it really amazes me that nowadays someone would buy a game just for what he/she sees in a trailer. Even more if there's a demo to try the game and see if you like it or not.\n\nMy advice? Go here: http://www.deconstructeam.com/games/gods-will-be-watching/. Play it. You liked it? Buy the game, it won't dissapoint you.\n\nI really think the work of Deconstructeam speaks for itself.","July 25, 2014","true","5.3"," 4 of 14 people (29%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","29","4","14","0","0"

You do make choices that impact the game; it’s not like mass effect where all you have is a paragon/renegade option. It’s more of what choice is going to save me, while still not getting myself or my friends, or anyone else killed. Though I kind of wish that saving all the hostages had an effect on the game later on, there was always an option to keep everyone in control. My tactic for the first mission was to freak out the most cocky character and send the girl (violence sensitive character) to the back room, then traded off the dock so he can’t cause trouble for meds, with only 3 to worry about you can keep 2 confident while you trade out one to the back room, and if they start showing signs of over confidence, start shooting the cops or start knee capping people. It’s a complex game, and they warn you about that on the cover, and at the start of the game. It’s like dark souls; if you’re not willing to observe your own mistakes, don’t complain about how horrible the game is just because you just can’t make the learning curb.\n\nThe game has some pretty noticeable bugs, its almost crashed on me twice while just starting the game up, But I think a lot of this is just patchable scuff that happens to almost all game at launch because its almost inconceivable the varieties of hardware and software that can disagree with a games functions. you cant catch all the problems in one go, sometimes you just have to take a risk and fix the problems as they pop up.","July 26, 2014","true","23.2"," 1 of 8 people (13%) found this review helpful","13","1","8","0","0"

For example, in the first scenario, your hostages fluctuate between two states: relaxed and tense. Relaxed hostages will assume that, while you're negotiating with the hostage rescue team and making sure your hacker is doing well, that you aren't paying attention and make a break for it. You can either shoot them or let them go, causing your hostages to tense up or relax, respectively. However, if they're too tense, they attack you, and they die in self defense.\n\nIn any other game, its a clear cut decision whether or not you want to spare a hostage. However, here, its all about resource. A hostage can be traded for benefits, or they can be killed to prevent them from attacking you. Your choice is dictated by circumstance and your abilities.\n\nAlso, you can see, Telltale style, how you stacked up to other players at the end of each scenario, which is a nice little addition.\n\nIf that seems too hard, (and in many cases, it is), the random elements can be turned off in the puzzle modes that have been added in an update, and if you want to experience the story, you can do so unhindered in narrative mode.\n\nBringing me to the story: it's fantastic. This is minimalist world building at its finest, and the story feels like a reward in itself. Finding out what happens after you save the world from genocide helped get me through the penultimate chapter, and the characters are lively, interesting and well written. Not to spoil anything, but the ending of the game deconstructs the very way we look at morality in video games, and the final boss is one you won't forget.\n\nThe music is one of the things I remember vividly as well. The way it subtly builds tension and creates an undeniable atmosphere for each scenario is uncanny, and is easily one of the strongest parts of the game.\n\nTL;DR\n\nA challenging game that isn't for everyone. The great story may be enough to hook you, however, and the unique take on the moral choice in games is something to behold.","July 26, 2014","true","21.5"," 1 of 8 people (13%) found this review helpful","13","1","8","0","0"

This isn't a "choice" like the game gleefully says to you, this is a force win with "♥♥♥♥ HAPPENS" in golden letters.

Tedium and retrials, especially when random chance screws you over and you have to restart.\n\nThen again I think this is one of those games where you have to understand what you're getting into. Life isn't always fair no matter how well you try and how many lines you cross to ensure success.\n\nSince it's a game you get to restart again and again until you feel that you got a result you can live with, or quit out of frustration.\n\nBut be warned this isn't so much a morality game (there is some) as a resource management intesive one, where the morality is how much you reduce the people in the game to statistics to improve your chances of winning.\n\nWith that in mind, the only real issue I can think of is that sometimes their non native English speaking grammar problems are quite distracting. Also the scenarios feel rather standalone rather than forming a cohesive narrative due to their non linear plot. So weird things can carry through while others don't. For example a guy's arm gets chopped off that's recognized in the future scenarios, if he died though it isn't. (Though this inconsistency turns out to be an important plot point by the end. It might be enough to turn off certain people though)","July 24, 2014","true","15.1"," 8 of 24 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","8","24","0","0"

Alberto Barbosa","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198195209143/","48 products in account","(Note: I decided to edit the review and clarify on things. I feel like my opinion wasn't clear earlier, and I was just complaining about the difficulty.)\n\nI liked certain parts of the game, and disliked certain parts. Because of this, I thought it would be good to review this by the chapter instead of as a whole. The game could have worked episodically.\n\nChapter 1 is extremely hard unless you actually figure out the strategy for it (which isn't clear at all), otherwise you'll have to play it on narrative. Once I figured out how to do this chapter, I actually enjoyed it a lot since I like grand strategy where you have to micromanage. This was similar in some ways.\n\nChapter 2 is incredibly easy on lower difficulties, but can be stressful which I like if you play it on higher difficulties. However, you need to know the strategy in order for it to be stressful. There is also a completely random aspect at the end which may make you have to restart the whole thing. For some reason, I don't mind the completely random aspect. It makes it stressful, which I like. I think this chapter was very well designed, and is the only time I've ever seen RNG cause tense emotion instead of anger.\n\nChapter 3 is easy to beat if you have paper to write on regardless of difficulty. It's easier, but it is entertaining so it isn't horrible.\n\nChapter 4 is easy to beat on any difficulty if everyone dies except Marvin and Jack, and it gets boring after that. Starts out interesting but gets old.\n\nChapter 5 is absolutely unbeatable regardless of difficulty. There are huge random aspects in this, and the chapter is very long so if you die you have to play through it again. There isn't any variation in this at all, the chapter can be summarized as walking through a randomly generated desert hoping to get to a certain spot, but certain tiles will make you die and have to restart the whole thing. Plus, completely new characters are introduced in a way similar to nameless NPC allies in other games. I guarantee you won't care about, and they replace the characters you may have started to like in the story before. I still haven't beat this chapter, and it makes up most of my playtime. There are other chapters than this and this one is unskippable.\n\nI really wanted to like this game, but I had to think about the story to figure out what was going on and the difficulty makes it impossible to beat, even on lower difficulties. If I could give this game a 4.5 out of 10 I would. I absolutely loved parts of it, but the parts I disliked eclipsed that. The good thing is that the problems are fixable if they ever want to do that. I think that the game has problems that when adressed would make the game amazing.","May 20","false","9.7"," 0 of 9 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","9","0","8"

You basically manage your resources throughout six levels, trying to keep all the members of your group alive while trying to complete your objective. This is often really difficult, and you'll end up having to play that level multiple times. That is where the game fails, because it often relies on RNG. You'll have spent 30 minutes on a chapter, and suddenly be screwed over and have to restart it. However, when you're playing a level for the first few times, it can be entertaining.\n\nThe storyline is where this game excels. The game does an excellent job of building tension, and the story has a sense of despair to it. Each level is interesting and mostly different. There's a chapter where you have to survive being tortured, and not be killed/confess too much. There's another where you have to use hostages to keep guards at bay, whilst trying to hack into something. You genuinely start to feel for the characters, and start to like/dislike them. And of course, you can decide to shoot someone you dislike so the group can have more food.\n\nThe game does have a really stupid feature in most levels, where only one character can take an action per turn. This usually leads to one person taking the entire day to fix a radio, while the rest of the team does absolutely nothing. On a certain level, it takes the main character an entire hour to put a log onto a fire, then another hour to set the damn thing on fire.\n\nThe game does have a few copout moments with characters, where they'll be a ghost for the rest of the chapter, or be a hologram for part of the next. I've not looked into it, but it seems like you can kill someone in the 2nd level and they'll reappear in the 3rd level, though I'm not sure.\n\nMost of the game is great, except for a few crap levels that you'll spend ages trying to complete, trying to not get screwed over by the RNG or using trial and error to complete it. There's also an awesome Groundhogs Day style fight at the end, which is really fun.\n\nBasically, you should buy the hell out of this game. If you don't like trial and error or annoyingly difficult puzzles, there's a mode to make the game easier or less reliant on luck. You can also make the game harder, if you're a ♥♥♥♥ing masochist.\n\n8/10. It's got great story and atmosphere, but actually playing the game can sometimes get grindy and boring.\n\nOh, and there's also a demo of the game online, but it's a crappier version of what is, in my opinion, the worst level in the game. The demo can be played here: http://www.deconstructeam.com/gods-will-be-watching/","December 30, 2014","true","19.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I absolutely love how challenging this game is. If you aren't up for a challenge, this is not a game for you. Buckle down, be patient, breathe, take breaks and keep trying different strategies until you succeed.\n\nGraphics - A throw-back graphical style that reminds me of the glory days of DOS games like Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis or the Kings Quest series. Just perfect.\n\nIt's mature - The storyline and subject matter the player is asked to deal with is dark and contemplative. Characters are memorable and answers are fully realized by the end of the game.\n\nSoundtrack - The score in each of the chapters is just superb. Perfectly aligned with the events and tasks to perform.\nThis game IS hard. And that's part of the beauty of it. Frustrating? Of course. Rewarding? Absolutely.\n\nThe story alone is really well written but the added difficulty makes the ending feel all that more gratifying. If you are up for the challenge, reward yourself with getting through at least one play-through on the Original setting. It took me 13 hours to do so but I felt it was completely worth it. Because of the achievements and in-story options for this game, it also has good replayability.","January 10, 2015","true","14.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Generally I try only once at a time, as a loss can be crushing and a success will leave you too worn out for the next (generally more difficult) challenge. I saw some reviews that said they ended up seeing everything they did as simply adjusting a variable, which I think really takes the fun out of the game. I was invested in trying to keep everybody alive and well, and it is very satisfying to pull it off.\n\nBesides the gameplay, GWBW has excellent graphics, music, presentation, and story (so far).

I ignored the latter so I wouldnt have any of the story spoiled.\nThen...comes release day of this "game."\nUtter crap.\nThe visuals were okay, but for the most part shoddy pixel work.\nThe character development...minimal if none at all. Barely constitutes anything for basis of a story in my book\nThe gameplay is more left up to % and luck than it is to what you do as a player in the story and the choices you make. In other words, the game decides if you win or lose, not your ability to play the game well.\nRepetitive gameplay throughout most of the game. I got bored by Chapter 2's cutscene and bailed for a while.\nNormally in this genre of "choose your adventure" games, choices have an effect on the ending, and I was expecting a good ending.

All there is is the story [A quiet interesting and darned brilliant one] and once that's done you can only. Restart the story and achievement hunt. Or restart the story on a different difficulty setting. Both of these seem unappealing as one, I'm not one to achievement hunt, and two, I'll probably suck balls on another difficulty setting [Narrative Mode FTW]. Unfortunately, as the game is set out, it seems unlikely they could add anything else for the populus to indulge in [Besides an extended story]\n\nIn conclusion ; If you're a average gamer, going for the average difficulty, you will fail, a lot. Emphasis on a lot. Even on Narrative Mode, I failed a plenty. Halfway through the game *Spoiler* I left my first session at a desert level. *End of Spoiler*  I then attempted the story on a slightly higher difficulty, puzzle mode light. I effectively rage quit at a stage I breezed through on the other difficulty. But, if your one for story and moral dilemmas this is for you. even if not, I recommend it. The game itself is amazing.

I have no problem that its a point and click, I don't discriminate. But everything is so damn repetitive to the point that it feels hard. Managing skills is key in this game as you will find yourself managing dire situations within the storyline. But the situations are setup as a lose-lose even on light (easy) gamemode. As alot of reviews have said already, the gameplay is loosely based off luck. You have to repeat actions to progress at the game but you also have to repeat OTHER ACTIONS for other side factors that will affect your progress, put those together and you get a VERY UNFORGIVING SCENARIO THAT TAKES MULTIPLE FAILURES TO SUCCEED. And no one likes failure, hence why a lot of people give this game a very negative view. As a gamer, YOU WANT SUCCESS! FAILURE AFTER FAILURE IS BAD ♥♥♥♥ING DESIGN FOR GAME CRITIQUE.

"Difficult" as a word doesn't quite do this game justice as a description. It is simply the most difficult game I have ever played to the point where I have to assume that any levels following the initial first level; a hostage siege, simply don't exist, as I have never seen them, and I resign myself to the fact that I will never see them. The first level's setting however is quite apt inasmuch that it is a mirror to my own experience in futility suffered through being held hostage by this game.\n\nThe developer gives indication that the game is in fact "their's" and not "ours" as players, this is given away by the fact that there are two game modes "Original - as it was meant to be played", and "Lite - a lesser difficulty". In that it tells you that a lighter game mode was seen as beneath the grand vision of the auteur developer. This is the risk you play when purchasing Indie games. The game experience is at the cost of the deveoper's vision, when in fact the two should be achieved in unison.\n\nI also could accept that the issue regarding difficulty may lie with my ability, yes, were it not for the fact that I've played pretty much every games console and micro computer in existence, right from casette based games you programmed yourself to cartridges and discs and never in all that time of completing games to a completionist level, have I encountered a game as staggeringly difficult as this. On "Lite Mode" it simply is just 25% too difficult for any invested player to achieve, makes me wonder if the game saw a gamer based focus group at any stage during its development.\n\nHowever the graphics are bang on the mark and so was that developing story from what I could gather. As an investment I could hardly recommend it however purely based on time and money invested versus progression, as I have so far played 1.4 hours and still have not progressed past the first level. Which is a new first for me, and it seriously makes me want to reassess wether I should keep this installed on my machine just occupying useful space.\n\nIn essance I really desperately want to like it, but how can you like something that at a base and fundamental gameplay level simply and stubbornly refuses to comply.","December 28, 2014","false","1.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I have no problem that its a point and click, I don't discriminate. But everything is so damn repetitive to the point that it feels hard. Managing skills is key in this game as you will find yourself managing dire situations within the storyline. But the situations are setup as a lose-lose even on light (easy) gamemode. As alot of reviews have said already, the gameplay is loosely based off luck. You have to repeat actions to progress at the game but you also have to repeat OTHER ACTIONS for other side factors that will affect your progress, put those together and you get a VERY UNFORGIVING SCENARIO THAT TAKES MULTIPLE FAILURES TO SUCCEED. And no one likes failure, hence why a lot of people give this game a very negative view. As a gamer, YOU WANT SUCCESS! FAILURE AFTER FAILURE IS BAD ♥♥♥♥ING DESIGN FOR GAME CRITIQUE.

It presents you with a risk management scenario and have you devise a plan to crack it. Then midway through it changes the rules just because, and you fail. Even though you fulfilled the original goals. Sometimes it makes narrative sense - even if it's infuriating gameplay wise - but later on the game doesn't even bother to keep the pretense. At one point you're tasked with researching an antidote in 24 hours or everyone dies. It consists of cracking a 3 digit code out of a possible 5, your scientists inform you, and managing a myriad resources to meet that deadline. You devise a plan to meet that deadline. You meet it. Then your scientists inform you they "forgot to mention", you actually have to crack a second 4 digit number in the remaining time. Of course you don't make it in time and have to restart, now with your prescient knowledge of how the game intends to cheat you this time. Please. If you're gonna ♥♥♥♥ me like that, at least provide a believable, sensible reason other than "the scientists forgot to tell you, their lives on the line and everything". The interface doesn't even help. One of the subjects you can theoretically test antidotes on is a dog, and naturally you wonder if that's a viable option. The option to inject him with the experimental vaccine is there in the menu. The scientists are in the room with you. You should be able to ask them about that, correct? You can't. So you go and inject it anyway, and then when you try to analyze his blood, nothing happens. No message, nothing (other than a very helpful "woof". Yeah, that answers everything I needed to know). In short, the game isn't fair, and it appears to actually take pride in how infuriatingly cheap it is.","April 20, 2015","false","5.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

MOVE PICTURE TALK - HAHA! - SOUNDS MUSIC GOOD! YOU BUY NOW!\n\nApology for the above: Sorry, or something.\n\nLong version: It is unfortunate that there are so many reviews on the front page (of the default view) which are OLD, which clearly complain almost solely of an OLD problem that has been "fixed" with what was called the "Mercy Update". AKA - the addition of more forgiving playmodes. Even the newest negative review looks like the person played it a long time ago - maybe prior to the Mercy Update? - and didn't write the review until now, for whatever reason.\n\nOkay, okay, yes, this game can be "hard", but there are now 17 kuhbillion different difficulty/playmodes which allow you to play this on "Please bash my surgically-exposed frontal lobe against a spike-encrusted, titanium-plated diamond/brick composite wall NOW! WHY, GOD! WHYEEE?!!" mode all the way to "Okay, so if I do something obviously stupid I may need to redo this section once more and/or my 27lb cat landed on my keyboard and chose 'Down' at that crucial moment-part, 'Damnit!'" mode. Actually the latter mode is the one I first tried this game on - because I was scurred by all the prior naysay reviewers BUT still didn't want to play the easiest mode. There is actually a mode that is called like "cinematic" mode or something of the sort that is supposed to be basically you + the game = interactive story time. I assume you can don some footie PJs, grab a hot toddy to snuggle in for a nice, cozy and gentle night-night story. :D About torture. :I Aww... footie PJs! Cute! :D\n\nThat over and done with, this is a solid indie game. It has a compelling story. It has interesting characters. It has great dialog. It has fun lo-tech graphics. It has cool music. It has a variety of challenge levels. It's not expensive. A small team handcrafted this game. If that sounds cool - TRY IT! Worst case scenario: You will be doing your part to support indie game-making. Best case scenario: You will really enjoy this little game.\n\nBottom line: If you like indies, and the video/screenshot previews look interesting to you, then what have you got to lose? $5-10? I'm sure you have done far worse at least 8,372 times already.","January 1, 2015","true","6.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Let me preface this by saying the art is wonderful, the music is great, the story is dark and full of meaningful undertones, and the characters are lively and interesting despite never hearing a word from them.\n\nNOW sadly the gameplay has nothing to do with actual choice. It's an absolute crapshoot to play the game as the developers intended it on original mode because the choices you make are almost entirely RNG based off of luck almost completely. Would it feel like an acomplishment if I were to complete the game on original mode? sure, but I have no desire to do so, and that would require the game not giving me a god damn aneurysm within the first two chapters. The game boils down to some sort of resource managing skills or making an attempt to gauge a character's state of being and give your best guess at how they would react to which choices you have. In the second chapter you're being tortured and you get to choose in between torture sessions whether you'd like a medkit, painkillers, or intel brought to you for the next torture session, which would be a really cool little bit IF IT DIDN'T REQUIRE 20 CYCLES OF THAT TO MOVE ON. Oh, and if you die on day 10 or so, you have to start completely over from, thus elongating your game time spent flicking through almost entirely identical dialogue instead of playing the game and actually furthering the story. Absolute trial and error, you're really just praying the odds are in your favor.\nFor example I played through the first chapter on original difficulty and every time I died (which was a lot of times) the game gave me the little rundown of my choices and told me I had a balanced approach. Managing hostages, an assault, and hack progress/security requires some balance and in finally achieving the balance, instead of being rewarded I'm greeted with another death thanks to some dumb luck, until my balanced approach worked, I'm guessing because the game pitied me.\nIn the games defense though it does have the cool bits where your decisions are shown at the end of each chapter and how they size up to every other player reacted to the situation and the decisions they made, which is ♥♥♥♥ing cool. Now don't get me wrong I love games that punish the player and have a harsh learning curve, Binding of Isaac, the Souls games, Rogue Legacy etc. but all of those games can be mastered. Skill can be developed to further progress your time to beat and so on. Where Gods Will Be Watching loses me is in the random chance and luck required in order to advance. Instead of allowing its players to progress in the story with penalties for the mistakes they made, which would truly change how the game is played and how the story unfolds (which would be extremely helpful considering a point and click game is centered so heavily on story), it restricts the player to ensuring each chapter ends with a very linear story progression (in my experience, keep in mind I haven't beaten it) that can only be achieved through frustrating luck and trial and error.\n\nSadly, I wouldn't recommend this game, but boy do I wish I could because it's fun to look at, the story is captivating and it has some good stuff going for it, all of which are ruined by chance serving as a gameplay factor.","May 12, 2015","false","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

For me the game is just too hard, even on the easiest setting and that ruins the experience for me.  I repeated the same scenes over and over trying to figure out the puzzle in how they want you to beat a scene, and it just got boring too quickly watching the same drawn out scenes repeatedly.\n\nI know some people get satisfaction from really difficult games like this, but I don't have time for that ♥♥♥♥.  I don't have a lot of time to play games, so If I buy a game I want to be able to get through it and enjoy the story or gameplay sometimes on easy mode. Then if I really liked it I play it again on hard modes.  Even on the easiest setting it is not possible for me to get past a few stages, and I personally hate when devs do that.  The story makes no sense in the first few stages and so I didn't care at all about the characters to want to keep trying.  I always appreciate when devs make games with difficulty settins, but if I can't beat a game on the easiest settings I always feel it is a waste of my money.\n\nThis game is definitely not designed for everyone, just those players who will replay the same scene over and over until they finally figure out how to get past it.","March 16","false","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Somehow fun and harrowing at the same time.\n\nGods Will Be Watching aims (I think) to put you in the position where you can make monstrous decisions, but not 'in a split second of panic' like Walking Dead did; it gives you all the time in the world to choose to do something necessary, but positively atrocious. This way you get to dwell on the ramifications. Also in contrast, this time to Papers Please, only the Gods are watching. How you complete the objective is irrelevant to the game, and there's no 'second booth' assessing your mistakes or concessions. It's quicker to inject a lethal dose of a virus into a human patient to find if the antidote works, and sacrifice your men in the desert to cover more ground, but if you're as immersed as I was this won't be an easy decision.\n\nOther reviewers will criticise the mechanics. Other reviewers are missing the point.

Secondly there is only autosave and it only saves at the beginning of the chapter and when you leave. But say you are at the last part of a chapter and your character dies you must start all over from the start of the chapter despite how hard and infuriating it was to get there. The game punishes you for everything. For example in the first chapter, if you do not shhot, kick or be mean in any way the hostages will revolt that's a good thing.

On the surface it's a meter-management strategy game with many randomized factors in play. The story is a sci-fi thriller about leadership, sacrifice and rebellion (among other things).\n\nBeneath the surface, there's a meta-story which constantly (and with subtlety) critiques itself and many other clichés in popular entertainment. If you have played Undertale, you might be more familiar with the idea of a meta-story: the player him/herself plays an important role in the game story (effectively breaking the 4th wall).\n\nIf you haven't played Undertale or don't have an understanding of meta-stories, then I would not recommend this game.\nThe gameplay is equally engaging as it is frustrating, but that is the whole point. The game mechanics serve more as a tool for narrative than for fun.\n\nIf you want a challenging and very narrative-driven game, then this is the game for you. This game tells many strong messages without even mentioning them, and that's what makes this game truly unique.\n\nIn my opinion it's an innovative masterpiece, pushing the boundaries of narrative-driven game design.","March 22","true","12.3"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"

It's more about survival and resource management than it is about puzzles. It's broken up into several different chapters, each with a different goal and overall mechanics, but usually with the same general idea of "get as many people to survive for x amount of time", and it does a very good job of that (with the exception of one or two chapters which were honestly just a pain).\n\nHowever, the reason why I absolutely love this game is because of its storytelling. There are a lot of themes of sacrifice and many difficult choices, often with unique and creative setups. Unfortunately, I feel like giving any specific examples would be too much of a spoiler because this game is absolutely unpredictable. One level you'll be withstanding torture, the next you'll be searching for the cure for a vaccine. Yet it all somehow manages to flow with a strange sort of brutal and intense pacing that will have you wondering what will happen to the characters next.\nUnfortunately, the ending could be a turn-off for a lot of people. Without spoiling anything, it gets VERY meta and kind of pretentious, akin to that of BioShock Infinite. However, while Infinite's ending had subtly built itself up over the course of the game, GWBW kind of just brings it in out of nowhere. That said, the way they do it is still VERY interesting and completely unique, so it is at least memorable.\n\nThe game is also very replayable, as there are a number of different approaches you can take to get through each chapter, and if you fulfill certain requirements you can even unlock concept art and additional background information on the characters.\n\nIt's far from perfect, particularly one or two chapters which feel completely luck-based, and the ending doesn't entirely seem to fit what the rest of the narrative was building to, but it still has an incredible story and the majority of the game is well worth playing.","June 19, 2015","true","14.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Ultimately the game is a 'stress simulator', each 'level' is a crisis situation where you have a number of choices open to you, each relying on a variety of factors that are strained as you progress until either failure or a (most often Pyrrhic) victory.\n\nWhilst there are a number of difficulty settings that alter how tricky the task will be, ultimately I found they felt like unengaging number-crunching exercises after a few failed attempts at each mission. You begin to game the system, rather than going on instinct. In one mission, it may work out better to kill a comrade in order to preserve supplies for the rest of the group, but instead of feeling like a weighty and meaningful decision, it instead feels like removing a resource-draining column on a spreadsheet. On top of this, the level of frustration rises when some of these scenarios take so long to complete and can often fall apart at the last moment. This leads to you trying the scenario again, often repeating most of what you did the previous time, with a few tweaks to your 'logic spreadsheet' in the hopes it works.\n\nWhilst this game may seem entertaining to some, I think most will find it repetitive, awkward and frustrating. A fantastic artistic aesthetic with questionable design.","August 13, 2015","false","3.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

On the other hand, in the Narrative mode, you'll end it very fast, but that aint challenging at all.\nThe thing is, somehow, i raged because it was too hard, i had trouble passing the first level and i passed it because there was a glitch, the second one was kind of easy and then i got stuck in the third level for too long.\nThis game is a pain when it comes to challenge because it's so damn ridiculous to  handle all the people all the time at once !\nThis is all about gestion, you got a crew, you got a thing to do, you got to survive, no matter what.\nAnd this part is tricky, because you can sacrifice others to move on, but it can also stop you in your next mission.\nIts so hard because you always have to check everything and even by doing that, some actions will end up provoquing the things you try so damn hard to avoid. A stupid hostage that you have been talking to 3 times in a row so he calms down only that another one jumps on you.\nBut, theres a but, the game is magnificent in some ways.\nFirst of all, its a MacPixel like graphism, without the scatology ideas, you're not here to play around, the story is serious and dont think you can just kill everybody because you feel like it, otherwise you'll just end up stuck.\nThe world of thisgame is very axed on the Science fiction, and i love this kind of game, it was really a nice game on that matter.\nFinaly the  story will put you on the line to choose, between your humanity and freedom, and thats nice.\nDont forget to play the last mission once you finished the game to learn more, i think i enjoyed it even more than the first part of the game.","July 5, 2015","true","5.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

That is a word that will have to leave your vocabulary if you want to enjoy this game because it does a lot of things that frankly make no damn sense. For example, it takes an hour to gather firewood and then another hour to actually place the wood into the fire. Then it takes another hour to ligtht the fire by zapping it with a laser. If you don't do this before dark you die... Also, you will be forced to eat raw meat while gathered around a blazing campfire because you are only allowed to cook during the day. You have to spend large parts of the game trying to prevent people from killing themselves in dumb ways. This game reaches a Shadowgate level of absudity in some of the ways you can die.

As a consequence, the constant restarting is really frustrating and really kills off your desire to keep playing the game, which to begin with is strong because it's an innovative approach with interesting scenarios.\n\nI recommend this game if you can pick it up in a steam sale.

One of the best, if not THE best, I have ever seen in a video game (Seriously, if you want it just for the story play narrative mode), the characters are deep, the dialogue is funny and charming, I really want to know more about what's in the universe, what other factions, planets, aliens, etc there are! Honestly the story is the best part of the game, it leaves off on a very philosophical ending, but I won't spoil it.\n+The puzzles have quite some depth to them. Not the wallowing ocean that is Dwarf Fortress, but a little nice pond that's big enough to swim in and have a good time.\nCons:\n-Unfortunately your choices don't really matter in the end, except maybe the sprite is a different color, or someone is a cyborg. Mostly just an asspull.\n-It's hard. Not a good type of hard like Dark Souls, but an annoying type of hard like Fallout New Vegas: Dead Money. I envy you if you are able to beat god (No pun intended) forsaken "Original mode", it's mostly luck based. And maybe it would have been awesome a few decades ago, but now it just makes you want to slam your face on the keyboard.

Other puzzle games have frustrated me easily in the past by requiring me to pick out several objects camouflaged in the background, add them to my inventory, and then rub them against each other in the most unintuitive ritual possible in order to progress.  This game has none of that.  There are very clear indicators of progress, success, and failure for each mission that are simultaneously very clear and very natural.  To cite one particularly gruesome example, on one mission my characters were holding hostages.  The mental state of the hostages was very apparent by their stance.  If they were relaxed, they would be sitting down on the ground flat on their butts, resting with their palms on the ground saying things like "Hey look, they're distracted".  If they were scared they would curl up into a ball and rock themselves in a self-soothing manner while saying things like "I can't take it anymore, I need to get out of here..."  The puzzle was to keep them somewhere in between the two extremes, since if they got to relaxed they would attempt to overthrow you, and if they were too scared they would make suicidal attempts to escape.  There was never any point in the game where I said to myself "what do I do next?", "man I'm stuck, I can't figure this out", or "this is stupid, let me just look up a hint on the internet to progress the story." Overall, it is well worth the money, especially if you can get it on sale.","July 17, 2015","true","12.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
