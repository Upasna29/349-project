From the beautiful Victorian steampunk world to the weird and wonderful characters existing within, cities feel alive due to amusing banter happening as you pass on by while the quest dialogue is completely voiced. More adventure based then outright puzzles, if expecting to be challenged you may leave a little disappointed. Makes it accessible and about drawing players into a strange world which it does amazingly well.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5qiV0WpZx4&list=PLslfvIJAupswLj9X4Odm82aRntW8fHpy5\nWith the sun fading leaving humans to evacuate below the earths surface in an attempt to keep warm, other problems arise. Biggest being the lack of oxygen, now limited and completely controlled by the mysterious Raven Corp. Fear not! A small group exists known as Traversers who can travel between Upper and Lower sections of Brimstone. Introduced to young Valerie Bennett your job is to not only keep the household running while passing school exams but figure out exactly what is going on.\n\nDecent length story, fantastic soundtrack, no gamepad support due to the gravity gun puzzles but keyboard and mouse felt intuitive and responsive. Sometimes play games you just fall in love with, for me this has been one of those rare times. No downsides at all (nitpicking, rotating objects with gravity gun can be fussy). Would rate it in the top 5 games I've played all year, 'AAA" stuff included. Will keep this short as I don't want to spoil the fun but as always if any further questions ask away and I shall reply. Cheers folks and happy gaming!\n\nNOTES:\nGametime isn't logged correctly playing offline.\nCould be finished in 4-6hrs missing some collectables.\nPublisher provided a steam code. Never changes my thoughts.\n\nIf you would like to see more.

It takes very familiar game elements such as physics puzzles and platforming and uses them quite effectively. Physics puzzles may be not super original as a game feature, but its the way their applied that is so well done here. I never knew what to expect and Traverser introduces these puzzles in subtle ways and never spells it out for you. I enjoyed this very much. Matter of fact the game does little hand holding and lets you figure out most of what needs to be done. Aside from the puzzles, the entire universe of Traverser just draws you into its unique narrative and charm. From the buildings architecture to the awesome flyers on the walls. This game has alot of personality and it shows. The voice acting is top notch and the story flows at a nice pace. The only gripe I could come up with for Traverser was the way game treats death. While there is no punishment there is a bit of a 5-10 second wait to reload and depending on how far a checkpoint was, retread the same areas. Also instant kill guards can be slightly annoying. This is a minor complaint though as death is very rare unless you mess up.  In all I had a great time with Traverser and personally can't wait to see what is around the corner and what clever puzzles are there for me to solve.\n\nI made a video review to show off some of the features and gameplay of this game!\nhttps://youtu.be/GU8MODXKyuA\nI hope you enjoy!\nMartyr","July 9, 2015","true","10.3"," 21 of 24 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","21","24","2","0"

The voice-acting was top notch and there were even subtitles.\n\nGameplay 8 of 10\nTypical adventure stuff , look for this item and do combine it with that one. But the twist is that you have a gadget called the gravity glove with which you can manipulate various objects e.g. stack boxes on top of each other to climb a higher a position. Some of the puzzles are quite challenging so be aware. It may be a little too tough on starters of the genre.\n\nStory 8 of 10\nThe story is the story of a girl uncovering the hard truth about a sinister and corrupt company which directs the lives of the inhabitants of the underworld-people.\n\nFinal verdict\nThis game is true hidden gem.

It does some things so wonderfully, but it just falls short in almost every category for me to want to call it a "must-buy."\n\nIt's a platformer, so I expect top-notch controls. These felt a little loose to me, I had trouble judging depth-perception on occasion and the movement felt a bit syrupy. The AI movement is laughable--the bad guys just don't track properly and are confused easily (which in retrospect is good for me, as I prefer bull-in-a-china-shop play vs. sneaking about).\n\nThe graphics are enjoyable, the music fine, and the voice acting was great. No real complaints here.\n\nMy main problem is with the story; it feels so incredibly rushed. This game would have been so much better had it taken more time to flesh out the story. I still don't understand the gravity gates, the upper/lower city; I feel like I'm missing a huge portion of the game.  If you've read City of Ember, you're esentially playing that story. Only not, because 2/3 of it is completely left out.  While the story isn't confusing in any way, it just feels so condensed. You don't particularly care about any of the characters.\n\nI was also a bit disappointed in the mechanics. You get a gravity glove in the beginning, think of it as a tractor beam on your wrist that you can use to pick up and fling things. Awesome! What else? Oh, that's it? No other toys? Just a glove? Haha no, that's not all. You also get a barrel to hide in. But yes, seriously, that's it. There are also some puzzles you encounter that don't need to be solved at all (seriously, what is up with those pipes in the sewer? Is there ANY point?). I wanted a few more things to play with, a few more interesting mechanics to explore.\n\nStill, this game has a certain charm. For all the flaws it has something interesting, which is why I'm being so harsh in my review--because it fell just short of being awesome. Remade and doubled in length this game could be amazing. If you can pick this up on sale I recommend it for the experience, but I can't recommend it at the $15 price tag. I've giving this a thumbs-up because I think the developers deserve a yes for the game, but take that thumbs up with the caution that for everything this game does right, it really doesn't quite satisfy.","December 26, 2015","true","7.2"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

The only real disappointment is that the writing doesn't rise to the rest of the games strengths. Characters aren't particularly memorable and, while the gameplay and world itself is amusing, the attempts at humour in the dialogue sometimes fall flat.\n\n8/10","July 12, 2015","true","4.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

In the beginning you'll find your father missing and that's where your story start. As you play you'll learn more about the wonderfully designed underground world, and it's many secrets. It's a story of dystopia set in a steampunk fantasy world.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHcB8c_EKTA\nThe mechanics are simple enough. With your special Traverser glove you can pick up objects, have full control of the X, Y, and Z axis.  You'll be using this very simple ability through out the game, stacking objects to get to ledges, dropping objects on weighted platforms, or even using it to build pipes. The game also features some stealth segments as well, having the player sneak past guards and cameras, as well as other segments where it'll require the player to explore the map. But to emphasis my opening remarks, it is the object manipulation and puzzle solving that takes focus here.\n\nThe game is quite a looker, with a great art style that capitalizes on the game's low poly look. With hand illustrated textures, dramatic lighting, and a delicious color pallet that you can almost taste. The voice acting and sound track are of equal praise. The actors portray emotions and character, while the ambient sounds and subtle music adds to the game's well developed environment, all of which, are stylized in a wonderfully steam punk manner.\n\nThe game looks and sound great, and the premise is simple enough, but how does it play? To put it bluntly, the game is very simple. Most of the puzzles aren't overly difficult, and the combat consist of little more than moving some objects and bumping it into enemies. For gamers that want complex, multi-layered gameplay, Traverser might not be suitable, even for those who are looking for a challenging puzzle experience, I feel Traverser may disappoint. How ever, I feel Traverser was never designed to be a brain teaser type of puzzler, rather, a more relaxed approach is taken. For those who just want to chill to some satisfying puzzles, that won't frustrate too long, while offering a wonderfully designed world to explore, Traverser can be a great experience. It wasn't the puzzles that kept me interested in the game, rather, the story and the sights. I enjoyed exploring the world and learning more about the situation, characters, and environment that it takes place in. It was my biggest incentive to keep playing.\n\nOverall Traverser is an interesting physics based puzzler, where I feel the story and world, carries a large portion of the game.\n\nPros:\n- Great design and aesthetics\n- Very Accessible\n- Great story and characters\n- Great voice acting\n\nCons:\n- Very simple mechanics\n- Isometric view can hinder precision","July 9, 2015","true","5.5"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","0"

In the downside, that's where you will see the poverty and the shelters, and perhaps some of the secrets that should be left hidden.\n\nYou will have to move through the different parts of the city, through a sewer, through a factory, and through a mansion. You are going to quickly find out that there's more to this rebellion group that seems to be just a rumor floating around the topside part of the city.\n\nArmed with a gravity glove you will have to pick up objects, throw objects, and solve puzzles. You'll also have to sneak, climb, run, and balance high on wires. There are secrets everywhere, so don't be afraid to go looking for them. They could be on rooftops, hidden in the sewer, or perhaps lying on a shelf, forgotten by most.\n\nThis game definitely had its slightly frustrating parts, one of the big ones is that the camera is fixed and there were times I wish I could have moved the camera around a little bit to better get a feel for the depth. You see this is a fully 3D game that is set in a 3/4 camera view, and there's no rotating of the camera, you can control the height of what you are holding with your glove by using the mouse scroll wheel, but sometimes even then its hard to gauge exactly where the item is in relations to the area that you are in.\n\nNow of course you know me, I've got to have voice acting, and this game comes through with flying colors. I enjoyed all the different voices that you get to listen to, and the best part were that they were all believable. You have a very strange scientist, you have the president of the company, your father, and so much more, each had emotion and were different, which of course drew me further into the game.\n\nAll in all I believe this game took me roughly three and a half hours, most of which I enjoyed thoroughly. Sure there were a couple of puzzles that I wanted to scream at, but at the end of the game I was kind of sad that I couldn't play further. There's definitely a learning curve to this game but if you can figure out the ins and outs you are going to find a very solid game. So with that I give this game a 9.0 out of 10.","August 5, 2015","true","3.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
