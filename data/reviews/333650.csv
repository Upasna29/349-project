There are still several pixel hunts and puzzles with no in-game clues that force you to guess.  Not helping matters is the fact that the hint button is buggy, unreliable, and has a long recharge time.  Sometimes it highlighted something I had already dealt with, or even nothing at all, and still reset the timer.\n\nPahelika may look a little more polished now, but it's still the same amateurish, nonsensical garbage.","March 6, 2015","false","4.6"," 21 of 31 people (68%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","68","21","31","4","0"

It is a huge step up from its predecessor, which I bought at two bucks and wouldn't pay more for it. The reason I am posting this review is because there are far too many negative reviews for this game on steam. Very enjoyable game, quite difficult at times. I found the hardest level to be the one with the air rune in the house. Which was like the second level, which doesn't make sense. But whatever, it was a very enjoyable game.\n\nOne thing however, there is a moment in the 'Ghost Manor' level when you are asked to order pictured events in sequence as it is recorded in your journal, which was collected chronologically. However if you are playing in non-casual mode, which many people who have high self-esteems would, then you would never know that it isn't in chronological order. Call me a layman, but I don't understand how even a genius of intellect would be able to divine that they weren't in chronological order if the game has you collect it as such. Other than that ridiculously impossible task, the game is pretty solid, 7/10","July 4, 2015","true","22.2"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","10","14","0","0"
