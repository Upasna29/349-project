This is frankly, to me inexplicable as this is the worst game in my library of 90 so far.  What makes this game obnoxiously bad, egregiously terrible is that it has surface appeal.  It deceives the experienced player of roguelikes into thinking that strategic and thoughtful play will be rewarded if one can intuit the subtle rules of the game.  Don't waste your time.  There is no depth of gameplay here.  For example, you find a potion.  Will it hurt you or heal you?  It's random. It might give you a permanent defect.  Or it might heal you.  There is no way to tell unless you drink it.  Intelligent decision making in this game amounts to not wasting a precious minute of your life on this cynical trap created by a soulless programmer whose only goal was to part you from your hard earned money.  It is one of the most offensively designed games I ever played in my life.  I am passionate in my hatred of this game.

Normally I can get some enjoyment out of rogue-like or rogue-lite games. Hard games are fine. Games like Demon's Souls or Dark Souls? Great fun. But Dark Souls has a design philosophy that makes sense. If you die, it's your own fault. You're punished for your own failures. But this game? It's basically just a coin flip that determines whether you win a fight or not. You're punished for things you have no control over.\n\nI think the biggest point of failure is the lack of a maximum health stat. Sure health is there, but the problem is it is finite, and can only be replenished by picking up a random enchantment from a scroll or potion or what have you. And keep in mind that it's random whether or not you find a scroll and random again whether or not this scroll will heal you. It could even be detrimental and hurt you instead. Basically if you get unlucky and take too much damage in combat? You're hooped. You have no chance. The point of health in most games is to give you a chance to survive even if you get unlucky.\n\nThere's additional classes that you can unlock, but the game is so entranced with being obtuse that it doesn't tell you at all how to unlock them. I unlocked one somehow and the game didn't even inform me that I had. I only found out when I returned to the main menu and found another class just sitting there.","November 12, 2014","false","2.4"," 112 of 127 people (88%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","88","112","127","3","0"

Everything. From the level generation to attacking and being attacked. You could literally die from the first rat you fight if your random luck is bad enough. I started one game where I spawned, opend the first door , and was greeted with about 7 enemies that swarmed me from the surrounding rooms. All of which got to take shots at me while I had to focus on one hoping I could get some quick kills. Of course I "Missed" about the first 4 turns I had so the game lasted 12 seconds before I died. It is basiclaly just a game of chance that you hope you will acquire some fantastic weapon, or gear randomly and you hopefully don't get hit every time you have to fight something before you can hit them. You can't really run away from anything unless you get a double move item.\n\nIt's just not that good and I wouldn't recommend it to roguelike fans at all. There is little to no "skill" involved in this game, and you will see no progression in which you feel like you are getting better at the game.

Since I can't really think of any pros that this game contributes to the genre, I'm just going to talk about the flaws.\n\nThis game is BRUTAL. I know rogue-likes are supposed to have you constantly die over and over but at least you make progress and learn a little more about the game each time you play through. However, I don't feel this way at all when playing this game. Well okay, I learned one thing.\n\nThis game practically eliminates 1/3 of your class choices. By attacking with warrior-like classes, you're guaranteed to miss most of your attacks and die within 3 minutes. With ranged classes, you, for whatever reason, have a higher accuracy and don't run as high a risk of getting hit, even with your health being low.\n\nSpeaking of which, it's almost impossible to get back any health you lose. In other games you find potions to restore your health and your armor is actually an important statistic. However, in this game, the potions are extremely rare, they don't always give you health (and the ones I've found give less than 10 HP), and with as much armor as I could find, I was still taking FIFTEEN damage from an enemy on the first floor of the game! Also, you start off with either 20, 30, or 40 HP, so...\n\nSpeaking of the floors in this game, the chances of completing a floor, or even moving on to the next floor, are low, really low. These floors are massive, and while that may not be the worst thing, there's no inventory system, and consider the flaws I've mentioned before. I've gotten to the second floor ONCE out of all my playthroughs, and naturally I lasted no more than a  minute. My luck, huh?\n\nSpeaking of luck, the biggest problem is the randomized generation this game has. I'm not thrilled with starting a game, having two enemies appear in front of me, me missing my attacks, and dieing without making A SINGLE MOVE. Also, like I said before with the damage, I don't find it really fair that an enemy on the first floor could whittle down a chunk of my health before even going through more than five rooms.","April 17, 2014","false","2.0"," 41 of 48 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","41","48","0","0"

A game needs to offer its players enough options to form strategies against whatever challenges are posed. Otherwise, you're just playing a glorified slot machine. I don't think the folks behind Hack, Slash, Loot understood this because they made a dungeon crawler that has classes with no skills and loot with no inventory.\n\nThe game dumps you straight into a cluttered, pixellated menu where you pick your class and your quest, and then get dumped into a crowded, nondescript dungeon. The perspective is a weirdly squished 2D where tiles are twice as wide as they are long, which crams the otherwise pleasant character sprites too close together. As you navigate the random floors and rooms, you'll find items like weapons, armor, potions, and scrolls laying around. Gear can only be swapped with what you already have, with the stat change shown in the corner when you mouse over items. Similarly, consumables are used the moment you pick them up, and their purpose is obfuscated in an annoyingly Nethacky way so you don't know what they'll do for sure until you use them.\n\nThese are all corner cases for those times that you're not beset by monsters. HSL is packed to the brim with things that want to kill you, while offering absolutely no tactical options for killing them back besides funnel them through a doorway. While this isn't terribly different from many old-school roguelikes, the distinct lack of healing items or reliable gear upgrades is. Everything appears to be randomized in the extreme, and with no inventory, there's no way to store potions or food until you actually need it. There's not even a guarantee any will appear, because I've definitely had runs end on the first floor because literally no healing options were offered.\n\nImagine playing Diablo without skills, potions, or inventory, and you get a very basic idea of how flawed HSL is. Streamlined roguelikes are an excellent idea because many of the classics go way too far in their complexity, but this completely overshoots the mark in the opposite direction. Nothing you do in this game will effect whether or not you win, and there's not even any sort of overarching progression system to make losing worthwhile. With all the clever, interesting roguelikes on Steam now, Hack, Slash, Loot is better left forgotten.","December 12, 2015","false","3.4"," 40 of 51 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","40","51","0","0"

Seriously.  The pixel art looks cool and retro for a couple of minutes but there is no variation on the blue tileset.  What you see in the screenshots, that's it.  Blue.\n\nThere is no strategy to it, you cannot avoid monsters once you've seen them and combat is random.  That means you're playing a dice simulator and hoping to roll only winning numbers.  There is nothing more, you can't hide, you can't change from melee to ranged fighting you have no inventory and can't heal after fights.  You can't even run away because evey character moves at the exact same speed.\n\nGameplay-wise there are just two tyes of enemy.  Those that do random damage from a distance and those that do random damage up close.  Again that's it.  There's no space for depth of play, roll a dice and hope.\n\nThe strange view angle sometimes makes it difficult to tell if you're standing next to something or one square away from it and also sometimes hides cupboards behind walls.  A minor gripe but gvien Hack, Slash, Loot does nothing right it all adds up to a pretty terrible experience.\n\nLastly - and for me the most frustrating - is the 'animation'.  One character moves at a time, if there are 8 serfs around you and a bunch of demons then you've got to wait for each one to do their little bobbing movement.  Similarly with ranged combat, if you're firing at an archer on the other side of the map it degenerates into a very slow game of ping-poing as the arrow crosses the screeon one way and then crosses the screen the other.\n\nPlay 'Doom the Roguelike' instead.

The art style is nice, but really too many games are doing retro. As a game, Hack, Slash, Loot is not fun, it doesn't just feel unfair, but it feels more difficult than fun. You can pick a class or have it random. You can pick a mission / quest or randomly do one. Either way everything is random.\n\nThe controls don't feel that good. Everything is grid and turn based. You can use arrow keys to walk around and arrow keys to push into an enemy and attack. You can attack diagonally, but that would mean using the mouse, which is fine if you're using a mouse. You can mouse click square by square to move too. If there are no enemies, you can mouse click to move several tiles. But its all turn based. You go once, the 'active' enemies all need to go before you move. You all go one by one, you don't have 10 units of movement and enemies have 6 moves of unit. You all go 1 space at a time. I had to explain this, because there are other games that feature more movement spaces or real time movement.\n\nThe levels generated don't feel balanced, its either you vs 100 or its you + 100 allies vs 1. But hey random is random. This is jut really unpolished. A lot of games would have an easy level first even if its random, but an easy level to get your feet wet so you can get some items. Not this game. Sometimes the only door to go from the start leads to a room laughably full of enemies.\n\nYou end up having to bottleneck to survive half a dozen enemies. Luckily the enemy AI is smart enough to go around and flank you on the other side of the room. Not always of course. Most of the time the bottle-necking works well enough, but the attacks miss.... a lot. I could understand enemy attacks missing, for game balance or at least having enemy attacks do minor damage when you just start out. Not this game.\n\nThe classes don't even feel that balanced. The melee classes seem to by far be the best. Especially the knight which, just doesn't seem to die at all. It slaughters everything. It may sound fun, but the catch is, there's such little depth to this game that it becomes a chore trying to find the next level to the quest. I'm bored long before I die. The range classes have a difficult task ahead of them, because of 'fog of war,' you don't see what's in a room until you open the door. When you open the door, there are enemies in there and rooms never seem to be large enough to kill enemies before they pile on you and murder you.\n\nIts just not fun, a lot of monotony, room full of enemies, fall back to bottleneck. As the knight you can just run from room to room and not even stop to face enemies, because its just a waste of time. The game is so shallow that you reach your peak pretty quick.\n\nNot just that, some different dungeon graphics would have been nice, its all blue. Every screen shot is blue. I feel like I saw everything the game has to offer within 10 minutes let alone the time I played it for. To top it off, there is no save, but maybe the game expects you to die before you'll ever save. I can't recommend Hack, Slas, Loot. Luckily I bought it for $1, but otherwise there are plenty of free dungeon crawlers out there.","January 24, 2014","false","3.0"," 46 of 62 people (74%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","74","46","62","2","0"

The point and basic design behind classic roguelikes is that it's tough but fair - every decision matters and every situation is or should be winnable with good enough tactics. This game, however, is essentially just a slot machine with a cute fantasy theme and nice sprite graphics. Whether you win or die is entirely up to the randomization engine.\n\nWill you survive and beat the quest? Depends on what loot you randomly find! There's no other way to level up, so it's all down to the loot. Will you survive the next fight? Depends on if your character suddenly feels like missing ten bloody times in a row! Essentially, your character in this game is the most useless warrior in existance. They can't even hit a mountain with a homing missile! Fights are tense, indeed, but not because the game is cleverly designed; simply because your useless character will just spend the entire fight missing their attacks.\n\nDeath in this game never, ever feels like it's your fault, because there is nothing you could've done.

It is not an understatement to say that everything in this game either comes down to little more than random chance and comparing numbers.\n\nCombat is completely limited to clicking on an enemy until they die. That's it. No special moves, no abilities, no changing gear, nothing. Sure, depending on your weapon you either use melee, ranged or magic attacks, but unless you're fighting near a weapon drop you can't change on the fly, plus your character will usually specialize in one type so there' very little reason to change unless you get VERY skewed consumable drops (more on that later). At best you can try to bottleneck enemies in doorways or tight coriidors to fight them one by one, or run away and hope you find something useful before you get surrounded, but that barely qualifies as "strategy". And even then, you still have to hope that RNGesus is smiling down upon you.\n\nThe item system is almost as primitive. Most of the time, it feels less like you are trying to decide which weapon or piece of armor to equip, and more like you're just comparing numbers (although special damage types such as the stunning Lighting do make things a little more interesting) As for consumables, you never know if a potion or w/e will help and/or hinder you, meaning once again it's entirely up to luck rather than any sort of choice or strategy if it help you.\n\nOh, and there's no save system. At all.\n\nAll in all, this game had a lot of potential, but instead the gameplay is comparable to banging your head against a wall while comparing helmets and popping pills that "might" make it hurt less. What this game needed was something, ANYTHING that might have made the gameplay more complex than dice rolling: Abilities/items to use in a pinch, swapping around weapons, etc etc: anything that would make success less dependant on how lucky you are.\n\nIf you're at all thinking of picking up this title anyway, I highly recommend buying another game called One-Way Heroics instead, which in a nutshell is practically like this game with the improvements I just suggested, and at only somewhat more than half the price.","April 22, 2015","false","5.2"," 26 of 38 people (68%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","68","26","38","0","0"

What is a rogue-like? Essentially its a dungeon crawler with random elements abound from random rooms, random enemies and even random item effects. They are tough as hell and often only for real fanatics.\n\nThis makes a little bit of an attempt to make things more acessable, different character classes try and make different ways to play work, a limited inventory throws out a lot of 'garbage' items and movement/attacking is done via simple clicks. However it throws itself back into the pit by cranking up the difficulty level to make things brutally hard, the random generator more often than not throwing you into rooms right from the get-go that kill you almost instantly.\n\nAnd its this that kills the game dead, theres no fun in repeatedly dying and resetting into a whole new dungeon so any progress or memory is taken away. There is also no fun in having controls that make it far too easy to accidentally hit 'friendly' characters, nor is it fun to have to unlock characters by the amount of times you have failed.\n\nIts a tiny filesize game but theres zero fun to be had here.

After choosing a hero and a themed dungeon (Goblin fortress! Pharaoh's tomb! Dragon's lair!), you are given a paragraph of exposition and sent straight into mouse-clicky battle. Your goal? To reach the fifth floor of the dungeon and slay the boss monster. There's no leveling to speak of, no skills, no puzzles. Your choice of character only determines your starting gear and your proficiency with melee, ranged, or magic attacks, all of which function identically except that melee can only attack adjacent opponents. That isn't to say there's no strategy involved in the game; HP restoration is very limited, positioning in combat is crucial, and knowing what sorts of monsters and hazards each dungeon contains can make or break your survival. However, the primary method for improving your character is to loot the place, which means endlessly comparing your current items to every item drop you come across in the hopes that one of them might outperform your current outfit. If you're lucky, you'll find something early on which offers tons of resistances or one of the handful of special abilities that can easily carry you through to the end. If you're not lucky, well, keep dying, and eventually you'll turn up something nice.\n\nIn the end, HSL suffers from a crummy GUI, tedious mechanics, and a lack of variety in almost every field.

I love the genre to pieces. I just got into them about a two year ago as of writing this, so while i’m no expect and have yet to beat even one Roguelike (i’ve come close...VERY CLOSE on a few of them) even the ones that normally hand me my butt back to me on a silver platter I still enjoy.\n\nThis is a bad Roguelike. To expand on that, this is what makes a Roguelike good in my eyes. Its fairly difficult, offers customization, practically an out for almost any situation if you’re smart enough to keep something on you to deal with it when the time comes (assuming you were lucky enough to find it) and, while it relishes in kicking your butt its still, for the most part fair and the majority of your deaths are your fault. You could had done something to prevent it from happening, or hold out longer or even WON.\n\nThis game is the polar opposite. The antithesis of Roguelikes that should only be kept alive in our hearts, minds and souls as a case study on how NOT to make a Roguelike. Its hard, but hard as in cheap. My little brother tried it once and never again because he was spawned in a room surrounded by three monsters and died after trying to move away and didn’t last even one click. The customization is their, but its all in the gear for the most part, and you can only bring with you what you’re wearing.\n\nThat’s right. No inventory to speak of and is incredibly unfair. Now I know Roguelikes are some parts luck based, but the luck factor in this one is so high it doesn’t even feel like you’re in control of anything. You get as far as the game allows, so you must deal with it. You can’t fight fate.\n\nDon’t buy this game, don’t even pirate it, its not even worth the time to STEAL IT.

There is no leveling, there is only loot. Of course, to get such loot you need to find it, off enemies, or out of barrels and chests. But, good luck surviving long enough to actually get it! In this game you have absolutely no passive regeneration. HP has to be restored through use of items and only through that.\n\nIn terms of mechanics, there's moving, attacking, and looting. Moving is really the one part I can't complain about, since well, you move just fine. Attacking is either ranged or melee, but regardless of range you will spend most of combat missing. You will miss much more than you ever hit. Now, with looting, there's one large thing that stands out: you don't have an inventory. You only have what you currently have equiped, and that's all. Want to save that potion for later? Nope, you have to use it now! This also means that looting devolves solely into: "is this better or worse than what I have right now?" And potions are only for chugging on sight.\n\nGenerally speaking, a game such as this has some sort of scaling difficulty. Either the lower/higher the floor, the more difficult things get. Or you find something like Risk of Rain, where the longer you spend in game, the more difficult it gets. This game? There is no difficulty. There is only the RNG. Add to the fact that the floors are absolutely tiny, and I hope you like get swarmed if you're unlucky.\n\nThis game is overly random and gives you no tools with which to determine your fate.

Combat is just "click the enemy until it dies", and it becomes aggravating when enemies are swarming you and you can only deal with one at a time because all you have is just one attack and nothing else, no special abilities or anything, and it's also aggravating how often you miss even with high accuracy. There's a lot of characters to unlock, but there really isn't much of a point to picking anyone because there's virtually nothing to make each character special, save for cosmetics. The only real exception to this is the Amazon, since she starts with a weapon that can boost stats or health when you score kills, and I guarantee anyone who played this game never really used anyone other than the Amazon once they unlocked her.\n\nAs for the gameplay itself, once again the game's simplicity is what ruins the experience. There's no inventory or skill/magic/whatever system, which contributes to the lack of strategy (no having to strategize what items you want to keep, what skills you want to learn, etc.), and you end up praying the game is kind enough to give you some way to heal because you will constantly die. I understand that as a roguelike, this game is meant to be challenging, but when you literally begin the game surrounded by enemies and die just like that...well, that's not a challenge, is it? And unlike other roguelikes, where you would be motivated to keep trying, to see if you can get further, this game gives you no such motivation. There's nothing to make you keep playing this game, nothing to make you want to see how it ends. It just feels tedious and boring and not fun, and if a game fails to be fun, it has failed at what it has set out to do.\n\nIn conclusion, Hack Slash Loot isn't a fun game. It's boring, tedious, and in my opinion doesn't understand what makes roguelikes work. If you want a fun modern roguelike, I suggest Dungeons of Dredmor, The Binding of Isaac, Teleglitch, and Sword of the Stars: The Pit, as each are entertaining and fun in their own way.

Toning things down from more classical entries to the series like NetHack or the more recent Dungeons of Dredmor, players are relieved of such responsibilities as developing character skills, managing an inventory, or generally deciding what action to take at any given time, provided those actions might have been anything other than moving in a particular cardinal direction or performing a generic attack on an enemy.\n\nThe final product is a game where painstakingly small decisions such as what equipment you've chosen to pick up and wear will be most input the player has on each adventure's outcome, and even then, it won't quite measure up to the significance of what items and enemies the game decided to spawn in the first place.\n\nUltimately, the prognosis for each freshly-rolled adventurer is about the same as in any other hardcore roguelike- anything but the most carefully chosen actions will invariably end in your character's death, and odds are the right choices will still probably see you winding up dead sooner or later anyway. The difference between the two is that in a deeper Roguelike experience, you will likely have had more than a few memorable close calls where gambling on an unconventional action pays off in a few minutes of continued survival, or enjoyed the unique experience of mixing and matching talents to come up with a wholly one-of-a-kind adventurer whose inevitable death was a mere period a the end of an entirely unexpected story. In contrast, Hack, Slash, Loot will take every bit as much persistence and consideration to advance in, while completely failing to pay off in any sort of fun factor beyond trading genericized blows with enemies and crossing your fingers that the sword you found in the previous room will give you enough of a numerical advantage to be the last man standing.\n\nTo put it simply, Hack, Slash, Loot mistakes simplified graphics and gameplay for a pleasingly simplified gaming experience, while instead only succeeding in creating a dreadfully boring one that actively resists being played in a remotely engaging way compared to the sorts of games it seeks to emulate.\n\nThe final nail in the coffin is the pricetag, which at the time of this review exceeds vastly more playable and equally casual-friendly Steam roguelikes such as Dungeons of Dredmor and Tales of Maj'eyal, either of which is perfectly content to kill you every bit as quickly, while affording a comparatively staggering array of options with which to actually enjoy your brief life.\n\nThe bottom line is that fans of the genre and newcomers alike will do well to look elsewhere. Hack, Slash, Loot may be charming to look at, but there's barely a game here to play, and it just isn't worth the time.","March 2, 2014","false","3.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Seriously, the only time I’ve actually made progress is with an archer and only through a long line of sheer luck…and even THEN I didn’t beat the dungeon I was working on.\n\nIf you don’t like roguelikes that rely more on luck than skill to constantly progress through a level AND have permadeath, you may want to steer clear of this one and instead go for Dungeons of Dredmor, which I sternly believe is the BEST roguelike I’ve played in years. Still, if you’re a glutton for punishment and Dredmor isn’t cutting it for you, go nuts.","March 16, 2014","false","3.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

There are no skills, leveling, inventory management or anything that makes these types of games interesting in anyway. It's basically "That's a monster, fight it and it may drop items that could be better than what you're wearing" sort of gameplay, and that's the only thing that's going for it. And while I'm not the type of guy that judges games on its graphics, for retro 8-bit graphics, it's the blandest graphics I've seen. I know it wants to be a simplistic style, but there's seriously nothing I can say about the game's art style that's great and it almost feels like the graphics are forced just to look retro.\n\nThere's not a whole lot this game offers. I don't really hate it, but I can't really recommend this to anybody that's looking for a great dungeon crawling rogue-like experience. The gameplay is as comparable to a punching in as many number problems in a calculator until it shows an error and you have to reset it all over again. The only interesting concept this game has is you can have a random quest and a random character setup as if you want, but a lot of the quests aren't really different since all maps look the same and save for a couple of maps, the enemies are basically the same.","March 26, 2014","false","1.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It can be fun, but only if you're extremely patient and don't mind having your ♥♥♥ handed to you every ten minutes or less.\n\nIt's a simple enough premise. Choose your mission. Choose your character. Go through the dungeon floors to try and complete your mission. Die. Try again. It's your typical roguelike in that regard. However, there is one thing that really makes this game more difficult than other roguelike dungeon crawlers such as Legend of Dungeon or even The Binding of Isaac (I know it's a bit of an odd comparison). The hit rate system in this game is seriously flawed. Your hit rate automatically starts out at roughly 60% regardless of what character you start with. You can deal a fair amount of damage and kill enemies in one hit, which is nice. Yet, you only hit them a fraction of the time and you can find yourself exchanging blows with a single enemy for two or three minutes until one of you dies. If you're surrounded by multiple enemies, odds are, you're going to die because you have such a small chance of killing them all before they've managed to kill you.\n\nLuck based elements in roguelike games are not unheard of. Quite the opposite. They're a crucial part of the genre. However, when it becomes TOO luck based, it becomes a problem. Random level, enemy and item generation is a good idea. Random hit rates however are not. It makes completing a single floor almost impossible, let alone a whole mission. If you're patient enough to actually sit through countless runs of this game to beat a mission, then this is the game for you. However, if you do not like the idea of huge maps with a flawed probability driven combat system, then I would recommend other roguelike titles first.","August 2, 2014","true","2.6"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

And more often than not, you'll be struck by enemies with abysmal hit chances to suffer a fourth of your health in damage. Combat is mostly fruitless since your character doesn't level up and at best your enemy MIGHT drop their weapon or gear, which might be an improvement over what you currently have. Not only that, but enemies won't approach you ever to get into melee range unless you're out of sight. There is only one skill to master in this game: not getting surrounded. Except that enemies can and will go around to multiple doors and open them to surround you, or even spawn in areas you already cleared.

Except that enemies can and will go around to multiple doors and open them to surround you, or even spawn in areas you already cleared. I've played a fair few roguelikes in my time and this is one of the most luck based ones I've ever played.\n\nPros: Aesthetics have a nice pixel, retro look, simple interface, enemies actually use simple tactics\nCons: Completely luck based gameplay, enemies spawn in areas you've already cleared to backstab you, combat is nearly pointless because of infrequent item drops and no leveling system.\n\nClosing word: Only get if you're a glutton for punishment and don't mind dying hundreds of times before you complete even one quest.","April 14, 2014","false","0.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Roguelike, you have to take every chance, try every door and kill every creature in your path. Incredibly fun to play, you don’t know who or what is in the next room, leaving you on the edge of your seat making Hack, Slash, Loot a go to game.\n\nFirst starting the game you are given the option of a Human, Wizard or Archer, with continued gameplay you are able to unlock another 29 over time. Throughout the game you will encounter hordes of monsters, demons, zombies, and a manifold of other creatures to battle. Being turn based, you have to wait your turn, so be prepared to click frantically until your turn comes only to miss and do it again. With that being said its not all clicking, there is a deeper level of gameplay involved in Hack, Slash, Loot. This game involves a tactical insight and understanding beyond pointing and clicking. Each different quests embodies another set of skills and approach at the game. The possibilities are endless, mixing and matching of accessories and armor make every run different and add a new level of excitement and draw to the game.\n\nThere are dark places in the world inhabited by evil denizens. Places filled with danger and foreboding where no ordinary man would dare to journey. However, there are a few who are willing to risk death in the name of good, in the name of justice, in the name of… valuable loot! Depending on what quest you choose you are given a backstory to give you a sense of what your goal is in your adventure. Within each of the different quests you encounter various creatures and characters that have roles in the story, or provide dialog pertaining to whats at hand. While some quests are easier than others, each are sure to keep you on your toes.\n\nPlay for a few minutes or get more serious and sit down for a few hours, the more you play Hack, Slash, Loot the deeper you become involved. The retro appeal of this game really sells it the most, imagine Realm of the Mad God meets MS-DOS Dungeons and Dragons, imagine Final Fantasy Tactics meets Hammerwatch, imagine playing while watching the animated Lord Of The Rings, because thats what I did and now I love this game. You have a control panel in front of you while navigating your hero throughout each quest. To the left you have the status of your character displaying armor and stats. In the middle, a mini map that lights up as you explore each room, this also serves as a quick point and click to get you across the level faster. On the right, the description and status of each tile, chest, monster or whatever you hover the mouse over.\n\nWith only the life you are given to start you must find chests or overturn dead bodies in order to find scrolls or potions to boost your health as well as other stats at the same time. These scrolls and potions are critical to gameplay and make Hack, Slash, Loot almost impossible to play without them. With 32 different classes to choose from, 6 unique quests, and an endless mixture of armor, weaponry and gear makes Hack, Slash, Loot an instant classic and a must have for any indie gamer.\n\nGraphics: 6/10\nPlayability: 7/10\nStory: 9/10\nChallenge: 8/10\nReplay Value: 7/10","October 10, 2013","true","12.2"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

It deceives the experienced player of roguelikes into thinking that strategic and thoughtful play will be rewarded if one can intuit the subtle rules of the game.  Don't waste your time.

Normally I can get some enjoyment out of rogue-like or rogue-lite games. Hard games are fine. Games like Demon's Souls or Dark Souls? Great fun. But Dark Souls has a design philosophy that makes sense. If you die, it's your own fault. You're punished for your own failures. But this game? It's basically just a coin flip that determines whether you win a fight or not. You're punished for things you have no control over.\n\nI think the biggest point of failure is the lack of a maximum health stat. Sure health is there, but the problem is it is finite, and can only be replenished by picking up a random enchantment from a scroll or potion or what have you. And keep in mind that it's random whether or not you find a scroll and random again whether or not this scroll will heal you. It could even be detrimental and hurt you instead. Basically if you get unlucky and take too much damage in combat? You're hooped. You have no chance. The point of health in most games is to give you a chance to survive even if you get unlucky.\n\nThere's additional classes that you can unlock, but the game is so entranced with being obtuse that it doesn't tell you at all how to unlock them. I unlocked one somehow and the game didn't even inform me that I had. I only found out when I returned to the main menu and found another class just sitting there.","November 12, 2014","false","2.4"," 112 of 127 people (88%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","88","112","127","3","0"

Since I can't really think of any pros that this game contributes to the genre, I'm just going to talk about the flaws.\n\nThis game is BRUTAL. I know rogue-likes are supposed to have you constantly die over and over but at least you make progress and learn a little more about the game each time you play through. However, I don't feel this way at all when playing this game. Well okay, I learned one thing.\n\nThis game practically eliminates 1/3 of your class choices. By attacking with warrior-like classes, you're guaranteed to miss most of your attacks and die within 3 minutes. With ranged classes, you, for whatever reason, have a higher accuracy and don't run as high a risk of getting hit, even with your health being low.\n\nSpeaking of which, it's almost impossible to get back any health you lose. In other games you find potions to restore your health and your armor is actually an important statistic. However, in this game, the potions are extremely rare, they don't always give you health (and the ones I've found give less than 10 HP), and with as much armor as I could find, I was still taking FIFTEEN damage from an enemy on the first floor of the game! Also, you start off with either 20, 30, or 40 HP, so...\n\nSpeaking of the floors in this game, the chances of completing a floor, or even moving on to the next floor, are low, really low. These floors are massive, and while that may not be the worst thing, there's no inventory system, and consider the flaws I've mentioned before. I've gotten to the second floor ONCE out of all my playthroughs, and naturally I lasted no more than a  minute. My luck, huh?\n\nSpeaking of luck, the biggest problem is the randomized generation this game has. I'm not thrilled with starting a game, having two enemies appear in front of me, me missing my attacks, and dieing without making A SINGLE MOVE. Also, like I said before with the damage, I don't find it really fair that an enemy on the first floor could whittle down a chunk of my health before even going through more than five rooms.","April 17, 2014","false","2.0"," 41 of 48 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","41","48","0","0"

No experience or levels are gained, your power relies entirely on gear and enchantments.\nSecond, instead of one or more large, random dungeons, HSL offers several themed quests with varying environments and dangers.  It's like a "puzzle roguelike," since they feel different and benefit from different tactics.\nCharacter progression relies a bit too much on chance, and many attempts end quickly when I spawn surrounded by enemies or just can't find any good loot.

A game needs to offer its players enough options to form strategies against whatever challenges are posed. Otherwise, you're just playing a glorified slot machine. I don't think the folks behind Hack, Slash, Loot understood this because they made a dungeon crawler that has classes with no skills and loot with no inventory.\n\nThe game dumps you straight into a cluttered, pixellated menu where you pick your class and your quest, and then get dumped into a crowded, nondescript dungeon. The perspective is a weirdly squished 2D where tiles are twice as wide as they are long, which crams the otherwise pleasant character sprites too close together. As you navigate the random floors and rooms, you'll find items like weapons, armor, potions, and scrolls laying around. Gear can only be swapped with what you already have, with the stat change shown in the corner when you mouse over items. Similarly, consumables are used the moment you pick them up, and their purpose is obfuscated in an annoyingly Nethacky way so you don't know what they'll do for sure until you use them.\n\nThese are all corner cases for those times that you're not beset by monsters. HSL is packed to the brim with things that want to kill you, while offering absolutely no tactical options for killing them back besides funnel them through a doorway. While this isn't terribly different from many old-school roguelikes, the distinct lack of healing items or reliable gear upgrades is. Everything appears to be randomized in the extreme, and with no inventory, there's no way to store potions or food until you actually need it. There's not even a guarantee any will appear, because I've definitely had runs end on the first floor because literally no healing options were offered.\n\nImagine playing Diablo without skills, potions, or inventory, and you get a very basic idea of how flawed HSL is. Streamlined roguelikes are an excellent idea because many of the classics go way too far in their complexity, but this completely overshoots the mark in the opposite direction. Nothing you do in this game will effect whether or not you win, and there's not even any sort of overarching progression system to make losing worthwhile. With all the clever, interesting roguelikes on Steam now, Hack, Slash, Loot is better left forgotten.","December 12, 2015","false","3.4"," 40 of 51 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","40","51","0","0"

Seriously.  The pixel art looks cool and retro for a couple of minutes but there is no variation on the blue tileset.  What you see in the screenshots, that's it.  Blue.\n\nThere is no strategy to it, you cannot avoid monsters once you've seen them and combat is random.  That means you're playing a dice simulator and hoping to roll only winning numbers.  There is nothing more, you can't hide, you can't change from melee to ranged fighting you have no inventory and can't heal after fights.  You can't even run away because evey character moves at the exact same speed.\n\nGameplay-wise there are just two tyes of enemy.  Those that do random damage from a distance and those that do random damage up close.  Again that's it.  There's no space for depth of play, roll a dice and hope.\n\nThe strange view angle sometimes makes it difficult to tell if you're standing next to something or one square away from it and also sometimes hides cupboards behind walls.  A minor gripe but gvien Hack, Slash, Loot does nothing right it all adds up to a pretty terrible experience.\n\nLastly - and for me the most frustrating - is the 'animation'.  One character moves at a time, if there are 8 serfs around you and a bunch of demons then you've got to wait for each one to do their little bobbing movement.  Similarly with ranged combat, if you're firing at an archer on the other side of the map it degenerates into a very slow game of ping-poing as the arrow crosses the screeon one way and then crosses the screen the other.\n\nPlay 'Doom the Roguelike' instead.

The art style is nice, but really too many games are doing retro. As a game, Hack, Slash, Loot is not fun, it doesn't just feel unfair, but it feels more difficult than fun. You can pick a class or have it random. You can pick a mission / quest or randomly do one. Either way everything is random.\n\nThe controls don't feel that good. Everything is grid and turn based. You can use arrow keys to walk around and arrow keys to push into an enemy and attack. You can attack diagonally, but that would mean using the mouse, which is fine if you're using a mouse. You can mouse click square by square to move too. If there are no enemies, you can mouse click to move several tiles. But its all turn based. You go once, the 'active' enemies all need to go before you move. You all go one by one, you don't have 10 units of movement and enemies have 6 moves of unit. You all go 1 space at a time. I had to explain this, because there are other games that feature more movement spaces or real time movement.\n\nThe levels generated don't feel balanced, its either you vs 100 or its you + 100 allies vs 1. But hey random is random. This is jut really unpolished. A lot of games would have an easy level first even if its random, but an easy level to get your feet wet so you can get some items. Not this game. Sometimes the only door to go from the start leads to a room laughably full of enemies.\n\nYou end up having to bottleneck to survive half a dozen enemies. Luckily the enemy AI is smart enough to go around and flank you on the other side of the room. Not always of course. Most of the time the bottle-necking works well enough, but the attacks miss.... a lot. I could understand enemy attacks missing, for game balance or at least having enemy attacks do minor damage when you just start out. Not this game.\n\nThe classes don't even feel that balanced. The melee classes seem to by far be the best. Especially the knight which, just doesn't seem to die at all. It slaughters everything. It may sound fun, but the catch is, there's such little depth to this game that it becomes a chore trying to find the next level to the quest. I'm bored long before I die. The range classes have a difficult task ahead of them, because of 'fog of war,' you don't see what's in a room until you open the door. When you open the door, there are enemies in there and rooms never seem to be large enough to kill enemies before they pile on you and murder you.\n\nIts just not fun, a lot of monotony, room full of enemies, fall back to bottleneck. As the knight you can just run from room to room and not even stop to face enemies, because its just a waste of time. The game is so shallow that you reach your peak pretty quick.\n\nNot just that, some different dungeon graphics would have been nice, its all blue. Every screen shot is blue. I feel like I saw everything the game has to offer within 10 minutes let alone the time I played it for. To top it off, there is no save, but maybe the game expects you to die before you'll ever save. I can't recommend Hack, Slas, Loot. Luckily I bought it for $1, but otherwise there are plenty of free dungeon crawlers out there.","January 24, 2014","false","3.0"," 46 of 62 people (74%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","74","46","62","2","0"

This game, however, is essentially just a slot machine with a cute fantasy theme and nice sprite graphics. Whether you win or die is entirely up to the randomization engine.\n\nWill you survive and beat the quest? Depends on what loot you randomly find! There's no other way to level up, so it's all down to the loot. Will you survive the next fight? Depends on if your character suddenly feels like missing ten bloody times in a row! Essentially, your character in this game is the most useless warrior in existance. They can't even hit a mountain with a homing missile! Fights are tense, indeed, but not because the game is cleverly designed; simply because your useless character will just spend the entire fight missing their attacks.\n\nDeath in this game never, ever feels like it's your fault, because there is nothing you could've done. There is no room for strategy and enemies just come rushing at you, eating away at your health while your mentally disabled warrior keeps missing and missing.

He's ranged and magic damage negates armor.\n- 'Mask of the boy king' is by far the easiest quest to attempt.\n- Try to resist opening tombs or crypts unless you're farmed up with gear as 90% of the time they spawn skeletons and demons. The loot from chests will sustain you with pots and gear. Monsters from tombs/crypts do however, always drop gear.","August 5, 2012","true","13.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It's got a great randomness to it, lots of loot, and some really clever elements like quests/themes to the runs. The quests (run themes) element of the game makes this feel very objective oriented with goals that you can work towards (completing a quest for example). While there are definitely issues such as AI causing problems, and not clearest item stats system, neither has a dramatic effect on the overall enjoyment of the game.\n\nIf you're a rogue-like fan, and you enjoy pixel/retro style graphics I highly recommend this game.

It is not an understatement to say that everything in this game either comes down to little more than random chance and comparing numbers.\n\nCombat is completely limited to clicking on an enemy until they die. That's it. No special moves, no abilities, no changing gear, nothing. Sure, depending on your weapon you either use melee, ranged or magic attacks, but unless you're fighting near a weapon drop you can't change on the fly, plus your character will usually specialize in one type so there' very little reason to change unless you get VERY skewed consumable drops (more on that later). At best you can try to bottleneck enemies in doorways or tight coriidors to fight them one by one, or run away and hope you find something useful before you get surrounded, but that barely qualifies as "strategy". And even then, you still have to hope that RNGesus is smiling down upon you.\n\nThe item system is almost as primitive. Most of the time, it feels less like you are trying to decide which weapon or piece of armor to equip, and more like you're just comparing numbers (although special damage types such as the stunning Lighting do make things a little more interesting) As for consumables, you never know if a potion or w/e will help and/or hinder you, meaning once again it's entirely up to luck rather than any sort of choice or strategy if it help you.\n\nOh, and there's no save system. At all.\n\nAll in all, this game had a lot of potential, but instead the gameplay is comparable to banging your head against a wall while comparing helmets and popping pills that "might" make it hurt less. What this game needed was something, ANYTHING that might have made the gameplay more complex than dice rolling: Abilities/items to use in a pinch, swapping around weapons, etc etc: anything that would make success less dependant on how lucky you are.\n\nIf you're at all thinking of picking up this title anyway, I highly recommend buying another game called One-Way Heroics instead, which in a nutshell is practically like this game with the improvements I just suggested, and at only somewhat more than half the price.","April 22, 2015","false","5.2"," 26 of 38 people (68%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","68","26","38","0","0"

The title describes everything you do in the game.\n\nIt has been described as a roguelike, it looks like a roguelike, but it completly misses the mark in terms of gameplay. There is no resource management, there seems to be no risk in using potions and scrolls; they all buff. Every entity seems to move at the same speed, which is not inherently bad, but limits the tactical landscape. There is very little thought involved while playing this.\n\nIn terms of playability, perspective can get the better of you if you are not careful around enemies. Sometimes an enemy is visible, but can not be targeted with a ranged attack, which seems strange at times. Otherwise, the simple gameplay leads to simple controlls making it very accessable.\n\nWhat was done well: the starting classes feel very different from each other in play. Allies intelligently stay out of your way in travel, but in combat situations they may block your path to the enemies and get themselves killed. Enemies stay out of reach generally, unless they have companions, which is interesting.\n\nAll in all, if you are looking for a casual turn-based dungeon crawler you may enjoy this.

What is a rogue-like? Essentially its a dungeon crawler with random elements abound from random rooms, random enemies and even random item effects. They are tough as hell and often only for real fanatics.\n\nThis makes a little bit of an attempt to make things more acessable, different character classes try and make different ways to play work, a limited inventory throws out a lot of 'garbage' items and movement/attacking is done via simple clicks. However it throws itself back into the pit by cranking up the difficulty level to make things brutally hard, the random generator more often than not throwing you into rooms right from the get-go that kill you almost instantly.\n\nAnd its this that kills the game dead, theres no fun in repeatedly dying and resetting into a whole new dungeon so any progress or memory is taken away. There is also no fun in having controls that make it far too easy to accidentally hit 'friendly' characters, nor is it fun to have to unlock characters by the amount of times you have failed.\n\nIts a tiny filesize game but theres zero fun to be had here. Avoid.","November 26, 2013","false","2.2"," 34 of 57 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","34","57","0","0"

After choosing a hero and a themed dungeon (Goblin fortress! Pharaoh's tomb! Dragon's lair!), you are given a paragraph of exposition and sent straight into mouse-clicky battle. Your goal? To reach the fifth floor of the dungeon and slay the boss monster. There's no leveling to speak of, no skills, no puzzles. Your choice of character only determines your starting gear and your proficiency with melee, ranged, or magic attacks, all of which function identically except that melee can only attack adjacent opponents. That isn't to say there's no strategy involved in the game; HP restoration is very limited, positioning in combat is crucial, and knowing what sorts of monsters and hazards each dungeon contains can make or break your survival. However, the primary method for improving your character is to loot the place, which means endlessly comparing your current items to every item drop you come across in the hopes that one of them might outperform your current outfit. If you're lucky, you'll find something early on which offers tons of resistances or one of the handful of special abilities that can easily carry you through to the end. If you're not lucky, well, keep dying, and eventually you'll turn up something nice.\n\nIn the end, HSL suffers from a crummy GUI, tedious mechanics, and a lack of variety in almost every field. It's perfectly playable, and winning is admittedly somewhat satisfying, but you can get better bang for your buck in plenty of other places.","January 7, 2014","false","9.9"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

Well, concider this pile of vomit! A Roguelike so terrible that watching a newborn kitten getting ripped apart by a Gorilla would be preferred to playing this!\n\nI got this from a bundle awhile back (the only way I would get it, because this game isn’t worth buying on its own and needs to shave 6.99 off its price tag at the least and even THEN its still asking too much for this thing) and since it was just lumped in their I decided to give it a try.\n\nBefore I go any further let me just say that I LOVE Roguelikes. I love the genre to pieces. I just got into them about a two year ago as of writing this, so while i’m no expect and have yet to beat even one Roguelike (i’ve come close...VERY CLOSE on a few of them) even the ones that normally hand me my butt back to me on a silver platter I still enjoy.\n\nThis is a bad Roguelike. To expand on that, this is what makes a Roguelike good in my eyes. Its fairly difficult, offers customization, practically an out for almost any situation if you’re smart enough to keep something on you to deal with it when the time comes (assuming you were lucky enough to find it) and, while it relishes in kicking your butt its still, for the most part fair and the majority of your deaths are your fault. You could had done something to prevent it from happening, or hold out longer or even WON.\n\nThis game is the polar opposite. The antithesis of Roguelikes that should only be kept alive in our hearts, minds and souls as a case study on how NOT to make a Roguelike. Its hard, but hard as in cheap. My little brother tried it once and never again because he was spawned in a room surrounded by three monsters and died after trying to move away and didn’t last even one click. The customization is their, but its all in the gear for the most part, and you can only bring with you what you’re wearing.\n\nThat’s right. No inventory to speak of and is incredibly unfair. Now I know Roguelikes are some parts luck based, but the luck factor in this one is so high it doesn’t even feel like you’re in control of anything. You get as far as the game allows, so you must deal with it. You can’t fight fate.\n\nDon’t buy this game, don’t even pirate it, its not even worth the time to STEAL IT. And despite what I said, don’t even give this to your worst enemy!

I am going to give my honest thoughts about the game, and help people understand the game.\n\nFirst off, the graphic they look like they're from "Realm of the Mad God" and "Legends of Yore". That's because it is. Sure people can say that's a downside, but it could also be a plus side. Seeing how it's simple and easy to know the enemy you're trying to fight. Another thing is how the fog is. At times, you can see something, but not be able to shoot it with your bow or staff.\n\nThe soundtrack has seven tracks. No joke. I got the soundtrack from the Humble Bundle I got the game from, and it is good when you first hear it, it can be a pain hearing the same few tracks more than needed. But, the game does have one track that does help. When the track plays, that means there's five or more enemies in the room.\n\nOkay, now, let's talk the gameplay. If you want to know, yes. It is a rogue-like game. The levels are randomly made as you play through the game. However, the game doesn't have one solid story like "The Binding of Isaac" did. This game has quite a few different stories that you can pick from, each with how to go through and manage the game. One story has a ton of tombs that you can look at for items, with another one with being a tower that a giant wizard use to live. They all mostly look the game, but little touches make it seem different.\n\nNow, the buttom of the screen is everything, and I mean everything. Your settings, your stats, your map, your bloodtype, everything. You move around with the mouse, and you do everything with the mouse. You might be able to play this with a touchscreen, but I'm not to sure. Along with picking your story you want to play through, you can pick which character to play with. Each one is different and unique. You can unlock more if you do some tasks, like dying twenty times (I'm not kidding). Some characters work best with some stories because of the items you can get in the story.\n\nCombat is what might make a lot of people mad. Whenever you move a space, all rendered enemies will also move a space. So, think of it as a game of chess, planning out where to move and when to strike your opponents. To actually deal damage on your opponent is as simple as clicking on them. If you have a melee weapon, you have to be next to them, if your have a ranged or staff weapon, you can be as far away as you can (but, still visible on screen). If you hover your mouse over the enemy, you can see their stats on the right side of the menu on the buttom of the screen.\n\nTo be honest, I wish I remembered how the stats work and how you can calculate your damage output. It is a pain when you start, but if you get this game, I recommend using Amazon (unlocked by dying twenty times), and using her on the story "Mask of the Boy King". This game isn't for everybody, but if you like rogue-like games, you might like this. However, I recommend getting it on sale or in a Humble Bundle, it isn't worth the full price. But, one last note, you can run this 8MB game on anything. I bet you can run it on a Raspberry Pi, I seriously think you can. But, with that said, I do like it. It is a game to play when you're waiting for updates to finish.","June 5, 2014","true","11.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I also found that the levels do not get progressivly harder, for instance, the first map you play is by far not the easiest, the difficulty will change on each playthrough.  By completing certain other maps, you might also unlock "artifacts" which carry over to your other playthroughs as well.\n\nWhilst the game is very RNG, I still ploughed plenty of hours into HSL and enjoyed every minute of it.

There is no leveling, there is only loot. Of course, to get such loot you need to find it, off enemies, or out of barrels and chests. But, good luck surviving long enough to actually get it! In this game you have absolutely no passive regeneration. HP has to be restored through use of items and only through that.\n\nIn terms of mechanics, there's moving, attacking, and looting. Moving is really the one part I can't complain about, since well, you move just fine. Attacking is either ranged or melee, but regardless of range you will spend most of combat missing. You will miss much more than you ever hit. Now, with looting, there's one large thing that stands out: you don't have an inventory. You only have what you currently have equiped, and that's all. Want to save that potion for later? Nope, you have to use it now! This also means that looting devolves solely into: "is this better or worse than what I have right now?" And potions are only for chugging on sight.\n\nGenerally speaking, a game such as this has some sort of scaling difficulty. Either the lower/higher the floor, the more difficult things get. Or you find something like Risk of Rain, where the longer you spend in game, the more difficult it gets. This game? There is no difficulty. There is only the RNG. Add to the fact that the floors are absolutely tiny, and I hope you like get swarmed if you're unlucky.\n\nThis game is overly random and gives you no tools with which to determine your fate. This game is simply an overpriced RNG that looks like a rogue-like. Look elsewhere for a good rogue-like.\n\n(Boy, am I glad I got this off the Humble Bundle and didn't actually purchase it.)","June 29, 2014","false","2.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Toning things down from more classical entries to the series like NetHack or the more recent Dungeons of Dredmor, players are relieved of such responsibilities as developing character skills, managing an inventory, or generally deciding what action to take at any given time, provided those actions might have been anything other than moving in a particular cardinal direction or performing a generic attack on an enemy.\n\nThe final product is a game where painstakingly small decisions such as what equipment you've chosen to pick up and wear will be most input the player has on each adventure's outcome, and even then, it won't quite measure up to the significance of what items and enemies the game decided to spawn in the first place.\n\nUltimately, the prognosis for each freshly-rolled adventurer is about the same as in any other hardcore roguelike- anything but the most carefully chosen actions will invariably end in your character's death, and odds are the right choices will still probably see you winding up dead sooner or later anyway. The difference between the two is that in a deeper Roguelike experience, you will likely have had more than a few memorable close calls where gambling on an unconventional action pays off in a few minutes of continued survival, or enjoyed the unique experience of mixing and matching talents to come up with a wholly one-of-a-kind adventurer whose inevitable death was a mere period a the end of an entirely unexpected story. In contrast, Hack, Slash, Loot will take every bit as much persistence and consideration to advance in, while completely failing to pay off in any sort of fun factor beyond trading genericized blows with enemies and crossing your fingers that the sword you found in the previous room will give you enough of a numerical advantage to be the last man standing.\n\nTo put it simply, Hack, Slash, Loot mistakes simplified graphics and gameplay for a pleasingly simplified gaming experience, while instead only succeeding in creating a dreadfully boring one that actively resists being played in a remotely engaging way compared to the sorts of games it seeks to emulate.\n\nThe final nail in the coffin is the pricetag, which at the time of this review exceeds vastly more playable and equally casual-friendly Steam roguelikes such as Dungeons of Dredmor and Tales of Maj'eyal, either of which is perfectly content to kill you every bit as quickly, while affording a comparatively staggering array of options with which to actually enjoy your brief life.\n\nThe bottom line is that fans of the genre and newcomers alike will do well to look elsewhere. Hack, Slash, Loot may be charming to look at, but there's barely a game here to play, and it just isn't worth the time.","March 2, 2014","false","3.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

There are no skills, leveling, inventory management or anything that makes these types of games interesting in anyway. It's basically "That's a monster, fight it and it may drop items that could be better than what you're wearing" sort of gameplay, and that's the only thing that's going for it. And while I'm not the type of guy that judges games on its graphics, for retro 8-bit graphics, it's the blandest graphics I've seen. I know it wants to be a simplistic style, but there's seriously nothing I can say about the game's art style that's great and it almost feels like the graphics are forced just to look retro.\n\nThere's not a whole lot this game offers. I don't really hate it, but I can't really recommend this to anybody that's looking for a great dungeon crawling rogue-like experience. The gameplay is as comparable to a punching in as many number problems in a calculator until it shows an error and you have to reset it all over again. The only interesting concept this game has is you can have a random quest and a random character setup as if you want, but a lot of the quests aren't really different since all maps look the same and save for a couple of maps, the enemies are basically the same.","March 26, 2014","false","1.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Combat is just "click the enemy until it dies", and it becomes aggravating when enemies are swarming you and you can only deal with one at a time because all you have is just one attack and nothing else, no special abilities or anything, and it's also aggravating how often you miss even with high accuracy. There's a lot of characters to unlock, but there really isn't much of a point to picking anyone because there's virtually nothing to make each character special, save for cosmetics. The only real exception to this is the Amazon, since she starts with a weapon that can boost stats or health when you score kills, and I guarantee anyone who played this game never really used anyone other than the Amazon once they unlocked her.\n\nAs for the gameplay itself, once again the game's simplicity is what ruins the experience. There's no inventory or skill/magic/whatever system, which contributes to the lack of strategy (no having to strategize what items you want to keep, what skills you want to learn, etc.), and you end up praying the game is kind enough to give you some way to heal because you will constantly die. I understand that as a roguelike, this game is meant to be challenging, but when you literally begin the game surrounded by enemies and die just like that...well, that's not a challenge, is it? And unlike other roguelikes, where you would be motivated to keep trying, to see if you can get further, this game gives you no such motivation. There's nothing to make you keep playing this game, nothing to make you want to see how it ends. It just feels tedious and boring and not fun, and if a game fails to be fun, it has failed at what it has set out to do.\n\nIn conclusion, Hack Slash Loot isn't a fun game. It's boring, tedious, and in my opinion doesn't understand what makes roguelikes work. If you want a fun modern roguelike, I suggest Dungeons of Dredmor, The Binding of Isaac, Teleglitch, and Sword of the Stars: The Pit, as each are entertaining and fun in their own way.

At the main menu you'll pick a character/class, each which have their own stats and unique style of play (melee, magic, ranged, etc) and depending on the quest, some may be better than others. You also choose the quest you want to play from the main menu, and each has its own story. But everytime you play one of these quests, the dungeon is different, since they're procedurally generated.

Most players find them unapproachable due to either ASCII only graphics, or very very high learning curves.\n\n"Hack, Slash, Loot" is different.

Steam hasn't tracked all of my time of it for some reason, though I did play a lot offline in the summer.\n\nI love this game, it's a good timewaster, I've had sessions that last 10 minutes and I die and that's totally satisfactory and I move on (or was just looking to waste 10 minutes).\n\nI've only ever beaten one of the scenarios but I keep finding myself coming back to it. From what I hear there are a ton of unlockable classes and I should play more. I don't play a lot of roguelikes though, I'm surprised I'm as into this as I am.\n\nThe music is (kind of MIDI-y and) very reminiscent of some other games I love (title screen reminds me of Castle Crashers, dungeon themes remind me of Zelda) and serves the game well. The sound effects are minimalistic but follow the 8bit style. I love the UI, very functional.\n\nI bought this game at full price, I'm not even sure why as most of my library is Humble stuff and sale stuff. I still recommend it at full price, though I hope it appears on Humble someday so it can get the exposure it deserves.","January 8, 2014","true","3.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Much of the games drops are out of your control and left to the dice (random number generator) which can either be in your favor or not. You must use doors and hallways to your advantage to limit monsters' ability to get swings on you which will greatly increase the odds in your favor. It is as close to a classic in terms of atmosphere and feel as you can get.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SpecterSalmon/recommended/207430/","SpecterSalmon","Specter Salmon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SpecterSalmon/","337 products in account","Okay, I hear a lot of how bad this game is, and how unfair it is. I am going to give my honest thoughts about the game, and help people understand the game.\n\nFirst off, the graphic they look like they're from "Realm of the Mad God" and "Legends of Yore". That's because it is. Sure people can say that's a downside, but it could also be a plus side. Seeing how it's simple and easy to know the enemy you're trying to fight. Another thing is how the fog is. At times, you can see something, but not be able to shoot it with your bow or staff.\n\nThe soundtrack has seven tracks. No joke. I got the soundtrack from the Humble Bundle I got the game from, and it is good when you first hear it, it can be a pain hearing the same few tracks more than needed. But, the game does have one track that does help. When the track plays, that means there's five or more enemies in the room.\n\nOkay, now, let's talk the gameplay. If you want to know, yes. It is a rogue-like game. The levels are randomly made as you play through the game. However, the game doesn't have one solid story like "The Binding of Isaac" did. This game has quite a few different stories that you can pick from, each with how to go through and manage the game. One story has a ton of tombs that you can look at for items, with another one with being a tower that a giant wizard use to live. They all mostly look the game, but little touches make it seem different.\n\nNow, the buttom of the screen is everything, and I mean everything. Your settings, your stats, your map, your bloodtype, everything. You move around with the mouse, and you do everything with the mouse. You might be able to play this with a touchscreen, but I'm not to sure. Along with picking your story you want to play through, you can pick which character to play with. Each one is different and unique. You can unlock more if you do some tasks, like dying twenty times (I'm not kidding). Some characters work best with some stories because of the items you can get in the story.\n\nCombat is what might make a lot of people mad. Whenever you move a space, all rendered enemies will also move a space. So, think of it as a game of chess, planning out where to move and when to strike your opponents. To actually deal damage on your opponent is as simple as clicking on them. If you have a melee weapon, you have to be next to them, if your have a ranged or staff weapon, you can be as far away as you can (but, still visible on screen). If you hover your mouse over the enemy, you can see their stats on the right side of the menu on the buttom of the screen.\n\nTo be honest, I wish I remembered how the stats work and how you can calculate your damage output. It is a pain when you start, but if you get this game, I recommend using Amazon (unlocked by dying twenty times), and using her on the story "Mask of the Boy King". This game isn't for everybody, but if you like rogue-like games, you might like this. However, I recommend getting it on sale or in a Humble Bundle, it isn't worth the full price. But, one last note, you can run this 8MB game on anything. I bet you can run it on a Raspberry Pi, I seriously think you can. But, with that said, I do like it. It is a game to play when you're waiting for updates to finish.","June 5, 2014","true","11.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This game does not feel like a completed product.\n\nAudio\nThis game lacks music. Most of your gameplay is filled with digital squeeks and sfx of the character's actions. The sounds get monotonous and boring.\n\nGameplay\nThis game is not repetitive for a dungeon crawler. This is good. The game was enjoyable for the first few hours. However, you'll realize that the randomly generated maps are at times impossible to complete. For example, you start a new game, and you spawn right next to a hobgoblin. You'll die. You won't be able to kill it, not with getting artifacts. The chances of getting artifacts are very low, considering that you'll have much more difficulty in trying to survive the first level, let alone trying to find artifacts.\n\nYou might be complaining that these "vanilla" gamers don't know what difficult is. Well, if you take the example of spawning next to a hobgoblin, you don't have a chance in playing the game. You could either open doors and run away, not knowing whether the next room would be filled with enemies or weapons to aid in your quest, or you could face the enemy and try killing it, dying in the process. This "fated death" does not represent what difficult is.\n\nThe good news is, such situations does not occur frequently. In my opinion, the gameplay does not leave much to be desired. The randomness did not seemed to be well thought of.\n\nGraphics\nI had a huge problem with the minimap. At full screen, the mini map was, too mini. You might be thinking, this guy is nuts! It's a mini map, what more do you need? Well, the issue is you can't adjust the size of the minimap. The minimap is important in this game because it shows you the loot, the unopened doors, and the stairs. You can also click on the minimap to move your character to the far side of the room effortlessly. A small minimap was just straining to the eyes.\n\nOverall, information in the hub (or whatever you call it) is dense and it will take you some time to get used to it. This isn't a bad thing. Some players may find that the hub is "busy" because there are a lot of things going on.\nYou can't really experience this by looking at the screenshots of the game. You have to play it to know what I'm trying to say. When you get into a room with tons of enemies, you may want to choose, say, the easiest to kill/most lethal to take down first. To do that, you gotta hover through each enemy to look at their descriptions, comparing their atk/def with your atk/def to determine the likelihood of you hitting it. This process isn't made easy based on the design of the hub. Again, it takes quite some getting used to.","January 25, 2014","false","5.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/forte479/recommended/207430/","forte479","DarthForte","http://steamcommunity.com/id/forte479/","197 products in account","Hack, Slash, Loot is a game that I got as part of a bundle, that I dearly wish had never been redeemed. Its presence, forever a taint on my library.\n\nAvoid this game, for this game is precision crafted to avoid literally everything good about roguelikes ever. Hack, Slash, Loot is such a bad roguelike that it can be considered the anti-roguelike, the embodiment of all the bad parts of roguelikes with none of the good whatsoever.\n\nThe game lacks any sort of mechanical depth whatsoever. Everything boils down to boring, static numbers. Where a better roguelike would have classes that play differently, different skills perhaps, equipment preferences and the like, the ability to use magic perhaps, this game has none of those things. And I'm not saying that a roguelike has to have those things, you understand. I'm saying that most fantasy roguelikes would have those things, for instance Dungeons of Dredmor and Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup. Even within the "Roguelite" games, you'd have characters with a vastly different playstyle resulting from different skillsets, stats and starting equipment, like in The Binding of Isaac, Risk of Rain, Nuclear Throne, Ziggurat, the list goes on.\n\nHack, Slash, Loot instead has classes that boil down to melee and ranged, no resting to regain your health, no skills, no mana. Your character is simply a walking sheet of stats, bolstered by your equipment that are nothing but stats. This creates no interesting gameplay choices, either you find something that has better stats than your current equipment, or you don't. There is no strategy, there is no way to build your character, there is no game to be enjoyed here.\n\nThis creates a game that is nothing but dice rolls upon dice rolls, with little to no player input involved. There is no feeling of accomplishment if you get further than you previously did, there is no anguish when you die. You cannot self reflect on a defeat that was entirely out of your control, you cannot ask yourself what you could've done better.\n\nThe beauty of a roguelike is its nigh infinite replayability, the ways you can experiment with builds, the magic of discovery as you find something that works, figure out the tricks of the game, and get further everytime. The excitement when you turn a bad run around after an item that perfectly synergizes with your current character appears, or the opposite, where you make it far, even perhaps to the final level, before dying. Lamenting that you would've won if you had the right items. And what about the times when you pull through a bad run? That is the core of the roguelike experience that Hack, Slash, Loot ultimately fails to capture.\n\nIn conclusion, Hack, Slash, Loot is a thoroughly incompetent roguelike that tries to distill the experience, but what you instead get is a shallow game with no identity, no soul. It is a bad game, it is a bad roguelike, and you should avoid it like the plague.","June 27, 2015","false","0.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It can be fun, but only if you're extremely patient and don't mind having your ♥♥♥ handed to you every ten minutes or less.\n\nIt's a simple enough premise. Choose your mission. Choose your character. Go through the dungeon floors to try and complete your mission. Die. Try again. It's your typical roguelike in that regard. However, there is one thing that really makes this game more difficult than other roguelike dungeon crawlers such as Legend of Dungeon or even The Binding of Isaac (I know it's a bit of an odd comparison). The hit rate system in this game is seriously flawed. Your hit rate automatically starts out at roughly 60% regardless of what character you start with. You can deal a fair amount of damage and kill enemies in one hit, which is nice. Yet, you only hit them a fraction of the time and you can find yourself exchanging blows with a single enemy for two or three minutes until one of you dies. If you're surrounded by multiple enemies, odds are, you're going to die because you have such a small chance of killing them all before they've managed to kill you.\n\nLuck based elements in roguelike games are not unheard of. Quite the opposite. They're a crucial part of the genre. However, when it becomes TOO luck based, it becomes a problem. Random level, enemy and item generation is a good idea. Random hit rates however are not. It makes completing a single floor almost impossible, let alone a whole mission. If you're patient enough to actually sit through countless runs of this game to beat a mission, then this is the game for you. However, if you do not like the idea of huge maps with a flawed probability driven combat system, then I would recommend other roguelike titles first.","August 2, 2014","true","2.6"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

It looks like it should be a nice game, and while it does have its charm, but just not enough to make up for its flaws.\n\nPROS:\n-A number of artifacts, once you find one, you can choose to start with that artifact in any future game.\n-A nice weapon/armor material system, silver weapons disarm foes, gold weapons give you stat bonuses occasionally, psychic weapons causes stat drain, among other things\n-A couple of nice references to other (better) games in the form of some artifacts and uncommon rooms (such as an Aperture test chamber and I'm pretty sure I saw the castle crashers knights once)\n-Despite not having an inventory (kind of a good thing, to be honest-it leads to less of the hoarding mentality many RPGs end up with) it does have a secondary weapon slot, and you can switch between the two easily, which I thought was a nice little feature.\n\nCONS:\n-Melee is awful-seriously, there's almost no reason to use it.\n-combat is dull and repetetive (there's literally nothing beyond 'attack' and 'move')\n-more than one or two friendly NPCs completely bog down the pace of the game\n-Unlocking more characters seems to be completely random\n-Death is frequent, not because the game is hard, but because healing is almost exclusively availible from random potions/scrolls/food (and the occasional vampiric weapon) and there's no garauntee you'll find anything that actually works well with your main combat stat. also poison is effectively incurable-if you can't survive until it passes on its own, you're dead.\n\n\nWhile the game is flawed, it's still somewhat enjoyable if you stay away from the melee characters and the Battle for Stormrise quest. Playing as a Pixie Mage wearing plate armor and using a gun to shoot weapons out of your enemies hands is hard not to enjoy.","April 1, 2014","false","13.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The problem is that this might be the first and only game where you can only unlock characters by dieing. So get ready to farm hundreds and hundreds of deaths before you can actually have a chance of any fun. Oh, and be careful for the un-winnable scenarios. I loved spending an hour in a dungeon only to make a single wrong step and game over. If you get poisoned, it stays forever, ticking away health every step until you die.

Be prepared to miss with your attacks a lot, often in streaks of 10 or more in a row.  Also be ready to have very little health, and not many opportunities to refill it or increase it.  As you descend the enemies get harder and harder, and they get more cheap with their attack powers, such as poison that can take off half your health over time, fire attacks that can also destroy your equipment, and lighting attacks that can chain stun-lock you.\n\nThere is also no leveling system, you gain (and loose) attributes from equipment, which is further modified scrolls, potions, and altars.  The loot in general is also very boring and uninteresting, and you will often see the same equipment you didn't want over and over again.  The best part is that to unlock extra characters, the game expects you to die over and over again.  You start with 3 out of 32 characters unlocked.\n\nI cannot recommend this game on any level.","August 27, 2014","false","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Since you start out with rather weak characters (you unlock new ones by dying in/failing a quest) the game seems rather frustrating. But don't let that ruin your experience as you advance you'll unlock new characters and get to the fun/challenge of the game rather quickly and more easily.\n\nThe game completely bypasses difficult and complex skill and stat systems for a rather basic approach. You have 2 stats per weapon class (Attack Chance/Attack Damage) a defense skill and health. In addition to the stats there's an "elemental system." You can either cause, resist or have a vulnerability to one of the 7 damage types; silvered, fire, lightening, poison, divine, necrotic and psychic. And that's it.\n\nIf you start the game up you'll first decide with which kind of character you want to play (32 in total once all are unlocked. You unlock new ones every N^2 deaths) you'll then decide what quest you want to approach (there are currently 6) and what artifacts to take with you (once you found any).\n\nDepending on these choices you also set the difficulty for your game. Melee characters are hard to play with (since they need to get close first), ranged characters have a medium difficulty (since they can shoot from afar) and wizards are easier to play with (since their shots penetrate armor if the enemy hasn't got an enchantement against it). Depending on their starting elements or enchantements they also add or substract from the difficulty, based on which quest you are approaching. It'd, for example, be quite foolish to try and attempt the "They Dwell beneath" Quest, wherein you go out to hunt down 5 dragons in a mountain, with a starting character or artifact that makes you vulnerable towards fire damage.\n\nArtifacts are found in specific encounters throughout the game or by finishing certain quests. Artifacts stay with you and can be selected as starting gear making your life significantly easier.\n\nWith all this in mind the games actual gameplay is rather simple but shines in one particular aspect: choice. In every quest there are 5 levels with certain enemies of certain quantities but they are nonetheless of the same kind. With this in mind the biggest challenge of the game is to take or not to take risks. As the "Loot" aspect in the title of the game suggests it makes you think rather hard on what to use and what not to use; "Are you taking this shield with you that makes you less likely to hit enemies and makes you vulnerable to psychic damage but gives you a steady defense stat that'll continually help you out whenever you are hit and in addition makes you resistant to poison?" or "Do I drink this potion which name doesn't suggest neither positive nor negative effects that could heal my low health but also make me vulnerable towards the current enemies most common element and therefor kill me?" are examples of the most common and frequent choices in the game.\n\nA lot of other people think this game is "unfair" to them but it really isn't. It is true that a lot of luck and chance is involved in the game, however this feeling of "unfairness" will usually go away once you've understood the game and beaten it once or twice. While it is based on chance and luck a lot you'll, as it is always the case with luck and chance, on >average< succeed quite steadily. That's what odds are all about. If you get into the game a bit statements will quickly go from:"Stupid game always spawns too many enemies and no good loot," to:"Maybe I should've taken that other helm with me instead and risk being poisened so that I'd have received less normal damage by upping my defence."\n\nSound and Graphics Some words about sound and graphics: The graphics usually don't exceed the 10x10 Pixel boundary per sprite or background element so don't expect too much even though it features fantastic and distinctive design within this limitation and the sound is really nice. This is actually the only thing that bugs me: The music doesn't consecutively play throughout the game but rather plays one soundloop on occasion. Starting a quest? Soundtrack 1 loops once. Found a big amount of enemies? Soundtrack for danger loops once. And so on. I'd have wished for a soundtrack that stayed with me for the entirety of a playthrough whenever there is no occasion for a loop. However the effects are nice and will kind of feel like a soundtrack after a while.\n\nIs this a game for me? So all in all: If you are NOT easily frustrated when confronted with chellange or a little bad luck, you like roguelikes and turn based dungeon crawlers or simply crave for a little bit of "something else" then please give this game a try. It'll surely not disappoint.\n\nIf you are easily bored or frustrated when confronted with chellange or a little bad luck stay far away from this game.","August 27, 2014","true","14.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I really do.  I've played a good few, and I enjoy a desperate struggle with limited resources, where every choice matters and one bad move can ruin an entire run.  I like to have to make hard decisions and cheat death through careful planning, frantic improvisation and the rare lucky break.\n\nHack Slash Loot is the antithesis of those things.\n\nUnless the game has undergone a  total makeover in terms of design since I last played it, it's a broken, pointless roguelike in which you stand absolutely no chance in hell of surviving (unless you get lucky and get a Holy/Virtue element weapon that boosts your stats with each hit, right at the start of your run).\n\nThe most potent strategy you have is "Stand in front of a doorway to fight the enemies one on one, and pray that the guys stuck behind the guy you're hitting don't loop around and flank you before you kill them all one at a time".  You can't even RUN.  The enemies chase you forever like homing missiles and will not stop until you've bopped them on the head enough to kill them.  There's no class-specific skills to use and manage either.  It's all about the items you find and pick up.  And getting them?  Random.  There are virtually no hard choices in the game.  Just roll the dice and pray you make it.\n\nIt's like playing russian roulette with a fully loaded gun.  There is no skill.  Only luck.  Winning (Or even PROGRESS) is impossible unless you get insanely lucky.\n\nIf you want a roguelike, go play FTL (a much better game), or Dungeons of dredmor.  Hell, if you want an action-based roguelike, Eldritch is pretty good and actually takes skills and quick thinking to beat.  Go play those or the many other good roguelikes out there.

It (Hack,Slash,Loot) serves my purpose for it. For me, it is the simple, casual, non-engaging go-to game that I can walk away from at a moment's notice.\n\nThere's no saving the game. There's no rhyme or reason to the drops. The monster difficulty depends on the floor you're on. For cleared areas, the minimap navigation is a big time-saver. You could spend an hour building your character just to watch it get torn down in moments upon opening a door to a boss that is way stronger than expected.\n\nPro's:\n- Casual. You can step right into it with zero load time and quick menus....and walk away from it just as fast\n- Pixel graphics are simplistic and nostalgic\n- Simple, fast learning curve. The gameplay reminds me of "Temple of Apshai" of Apple II fame. Item upgrades and potions are easy to choose (or to know the effects that result)\n\nCon's:\n- No story, beyond some paltry title page blurb. No sense of story progression either.\n- Character ability is a set of stats that calculate based on to-hit and parry roles.\n- No room for combat strategy. Just try to channelize groups of baddies and hope you outlast them.\n\nIn conclusion, if you wanted a rogue-like dungeon game that's story-rich and full of stimulating and complex battle strategy, or multiplayer party based co-op, you're missing the point with this one.  If you want a simple, casual time passer that you can blow unimportant time with,  well this one may be exactly what you need.\n\nA game to play while waiting on the\ncable company hold music:                 10/10\n","January 23, 2015","true","9.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Since you start out with rather weak characters (you unlock new ones by dying in/failing a quest) the game seems rather frustrating. But don't let that ruin your experience as you advance you'll unlock new characters and get to the fun/challenge of the game rather quickly and more easily.\n\nThe game completely bypasses difficult and complex skill and stat systems for a rather basic approach. You have 2 stats per weapon class (Attack Chance/Attack Damage) a defense skill and health. In addition to the stats there's an "elemental system." You can either cause, resist or have a vulnerability to one of the 7 damage types; silvered, fire, lightening, poison, divine, necrotic and psychic. And that's it.\n\nIf you start the game up you'll first decide with which kind of character you want to play (32 in total once all are unlocked. You unlock new ones every N^2 deaths) you'll then decide what quest you want to approach (there are currently 6) and what artifacts to take with you (once you found any).\n\nDepending on these choices you also set the difficulty for your game. Melee characters are hard to play with (since they need to get close first), ranged characters have a medium difficulty (since they can shoot from afar) and wizards are easier to play with (since their shots penetrate armor if the enemy hasn't got an enchantement against it). Depending on their starting elements or enchantements they also add or substract from the difficulty, based on which quest you are approaching. It'd, for example, be quite foolish to try and attempt the "They Dwell beneath" Quest, wherein you go out to hunt down 5 dragons in a mountain, with a starting character or artifact that makes you vulnerable towards fire damage.\n\nArtifacts are found in specific encounters throughout the game or by finishing certain quests. Artifacts stay with you and can be selected as starting gear making your life significantly easier.\n\nWith all this in mind the games actual gameplay is rather simple but shines in one particular aspect: choice. In every quest there are 5 levels with certain enemies of certain quantities but they are nonetheless of the same kind. With this in mind the biggest challenge of the game is to take or not to take risks. As the "Loot" aspect in the title of the game suggests it makes you think rather hard on what to use and what not to use; "Are you taking this shield with you that makes you less likely to hit enemies and makes you vulnerable to psychic damage but gives you a steady defense stat that'll continually help you out whenever you are hit and in addition makes you resistant to poison?" or "Do I drink this potion which name doesn't suggest neither positive nor negative effects that could heal my low health but also make me vulnerable towards the current enemies most common element and therefor kill me?" are examples of the most common and frequent choices in the game.\n\nA lot of other people think this game is "unfair" to them but it really isn't. It is true that a lot of luck and chance is involved in the game, however this feeling of "unfairness" will usually go away once you've understood the game and beaten it once or twice. While it is based on chance and luck a lot you'll, as it is always the case with luck and chance, on >average< succeed quite steadily. That's what odds are all about. If you get into the game a bit statements will quickly go from:"Stupid game always spawns too many enemies and no good loot," to:"Maybe I should've taken that other helm with me instead and risk being poisened so that I'd have received less normal damage by upping my defence."\n\nSound and Graphics Some words about sound and graphics: The graphics usually don't exceed the 10x10 Pixel boundary per sprite or background element so don't expect too much even though it features fantastic and distinctive design within this limitation and the sound is really nice. This is actually the only thing that bugs me: The music doesn't consecutively play throughout the game but rather plays one soundloop on occasion. Starting a quest? Soundtrack 1 loops once. Found a big amount of enemies? Soundtrack for danger loops once. And so on. I'd have wished for a soundtrack that stayed with me for the entirety of a playthrough whenever there is no occasion for a loop. However the effects are nice and will kind of feel like a soundtrack after a while.\n\nIs this a game for me? So all in all: If you are NOT easily frustrated when confronted with chellange or a little bad luck, you like roguelikes and turn based dungeon crawlers or simply crave for a little bit of "something else" then please give this game a try. It'll surely not disappoint.\n\nIf you are easily bored or frustrated when confronted with chellange or a little bad luck stay far away from this game.","August 27, 2014","true","14.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Its appealingly nostalgic looking, fairly accessible, and charmingly simple - cutting back on a lot of roguelike conventions without losing the main idea. Looting and getting stronger is predictably addictive.\n\nUnfortunately it still feels unpolished and balanced poorly, and the worst offender is the fact that there are just relatively few meaningful actions for the player to consider and take throughout a playthrough. Questions a player faces are two: whether or not to engage, or whether or not to equip - and the answers to those questions are often strikingly obvious. I also haven't found a single practical reason yet to focus on melee over ranged weaponry. That fact combined with a relatively common boost makes the experience very simple to game.\n\nIn some was HSL feels like an iOS casual game, with a veneer of hardcore trappings, minus the in-app purchases.

It (Hack,Slash,Loot) serves my purpose for it. For me, it is the simple, casual, non-engaging go-to game that I can walk away from at a moment's notice.\n\nThere's no saving the game. There's no rhyme or reason to the drops. The monster difficulty depends on the floor you're on. For cleared areas, the minimap navigation is a big time-saver. You could spend an hour building your character just to watch it get torn down in moments upon opening a door to a boss that is way stronger than expected.\n\nPro's:\n- Casual. You can step right into it with zero load time and quick menus....and walk away from it just as fast\n- Pixel graphics are simplistic and nostalgic\n- Simple, fast learning curve. The gameplay reminds me of "Temple of Apshai" of Apple II fame. Item upgrades and potions are easy to choose (or to know the effects that result)\n\nCon's:\n- No story, beyond some paltry title page blurb. No sense of story progression either.\n- Character ability is a set of stats that calculate based on to-hit and parry roles.\n- No room for combat strategy. Just try to channelize groups of baddies and hope you outlast them.\n\nIn conclusion, if you wanted a rogue-like dungeon game that's story-rich and full of stimulating and complex battle strategy, or multiplayer party based co-op, you're missing the point with this one.  If you want a simple, casual time passer that you can blow unimportant time with,  well this one may be exactly what you need.\n\nA game to play while waiting on the\ncable company hold music:                 10/10\n","January 23, 2015","true","9.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There's definitely a very good randomly-generated element to it, with randomly generated maps, enemy placements, loot, etc. What kills it for me, however, is the fact that there is barely anything to do in terms of combat -- there are three damage types (magic, melee, ranged), but the magic and ranged attacks play out identically in that they both have ranged attacks compared to melee's 1-tile range. In essence, it feels like the only reason there are ranged and magic damage types is so that the randomly generated loot isn't a coin flip to see if it's relevant to you or not.\n\nI haven't seen anything resembling skills or abilities (though there are evidently artifacts that you can unlock once you beat a small campaign, allowing for better starting stats), so combat is literally just rolling the dice to see who hits and who doesn't with no room for any other options. As a result, playing with line of sight to minimize the amount of ranged attacks that can hit you during combat is the closest thing to tactics you'd have to employ. Inevitably, at many points in the game, you'll just spend many turns clicking on the same tile down a bottleneck, which is about as degenerate of an experience as I can imagine. Given how wild the RNG can be with the combat, sometimes even this much planning is not enough to do well, as enemies can hit devastatingly hard and your character's ~60% to hit does not perform as consistently as it would have you believe.\n\nIf you want a fantasy dice-rolling simulator, look no further. If you wanted something interactive or exciting, there are many better options out there.","September 24, 2015","false","4.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Both times didn’t last very long… As you can tell by my total play time of an hour. I’m just gonna be straight and say I don’t like this game. But the fact that I’m reviewing it after an hour should be more than enough evidence of that.\n\nThe main issues I have with Hack, Slash, Loot stem from the fact that it is based entirely around luck, it’s rather shallow, and frankly it’s just unengaging. Also I wanted to play it more, but it’s now continuously crashing; thus preventing me from even giving the game another chance. It’s almost as if the game knows I’m not fond of it and it’s hiding from further examination!\n\nCrashing aside Hack, Slash, Loot definitely has some cool ideas, but the game’s execution could definitely have used some work. When the game launches, after you’ve taken about five minutes to parse the UI, you can pick from a rather large selection of quests-- these are essentially the game’s ‘campaigns’; and four character classes. The game’s various quests are really just a set of parameters on the random dungeon generation. Apparently the dungeons span multiple floors and also contain bosses but I’ve never lived long enough to see one…\n\nThis is because the game pits you off against a nearly unending horde of monsters that do far too much damage, have way too much health, and almost comically out number you. Plus healing items are few and far between due to the random nature of the game’s loot. In the hour I’ve played I’ve probably run through thirty or forty dungeons.\n\nLet that sink in.\n\nMy longest run was probably 20 minutes, and I still never made it past the first floor. Hell, I’ve died in the room that I spawned in.\n\nFighting hordes of powerful enemies can definitely be fun, other games prove this. But Hack, Slash, Loot’s reliance on luck permeates into the combat as well. Even with a 60% chance to hit I find myself missing the majority of my shots. A fight with a single monster can take upwards of ten turns or more, which are spent watching your character and the monster haplessly flail at one another only occasionally connecting. Once you finally land a hit and damage to the monster you have to hope that you roll well... or you’ll find yourself dealing almost no damage, making the fight take even longer.\n\nThere’s nothing like missing ten attacks only to land one and deal 2 damage.\n\nThe best way I can describe this game is that it feels like a Pen and Paper RPG, like Pathfinder… But without any of the systems that actually allow you to do the cool stuff.\n\nThere are no modifiers that help your dice rolls, or give you an edge. It’s just raw randomness.\n\nMost of the time you simply rely on luck, and hope that the five orcs breathing down your neck miss more than you do. Or that you get a good weapon that can deal decent damage. But that only happened to me once, and then I promptly died.\n\nThis game definitely has potential. And it’s clearly there under the layers of randomness… But  as it stands Hack, Slash, Loot isn’t worth your time.","May 19","false","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

After playing 10-15 minutes I assumed I was missing something and there must be more to the game, so I visited the forums, but as near as I can tell that's really all there is to it.

And more often than not, you'll be struck by enemies with abysmal hit chances to suffer a fourth of your health in damage.

Not only that, but enemies won't approach you ever to get into melee range unless you're out of sight. There is only one skill to master in this game: not getting surrounded.

Roguelike, you have to take every chance, try every door and kill every creature in your path. Incredibly fun to play, you don’t know who or what is in the next room, leaving you on the edge of your seat making Hack, Slash, Loot a go to game.\n\nFirst starting the game you are given the option of a Human, Wizard or Archer, with continued gameplay you are able to unlock another 29 over time. Throughout the game you will encounter hordes of monsters, demons, zombies, and a manifold of other creatures to battle. Being turn based, you have to wait your turn, so be prepared to click frantically until your turn comes only to miss and do it again. With that being said its not all clicking, there is a deeper level of gameplay involved in Hack, Slash, Loot. This game involves a tactical insight and understanding beyond pointing and clicking. Each different quests embodies another set of skills and approach at the game. The possibilities are endless, mixing and matching of accessories and armor make every run different and add a new level of excitement and draw to the game.\n\nThere are dark places in the world inhabited by evil denizens. Places filled with danger and foreboding where no ordinary man would dare to journey. However, there are a few who are willing to risk death in the name of good, in the name of justice, in the name of… valuable loot! Depending on what quest you choose you are given a backstory to give you a sense of what your goal is in your adventure. Within each of the different quests you encounter various creatures and characters that have roles in the story, or provide dialog pertaining to whats at hand. While some quests are easier than others, each are sure to keep you on your toes.\n\nPlay for a few minutes or get more serious and sit down for a few hours, the more you play Hack, Slash, Loot the deeper you become involved. The retro appeal of this game really sells it the most, imagine Realm of the Mad God meets MS-DOS Dungeons and Dragons, imagine Final Fantasy Tactics meets Hammerwatch, imagine playing while watching the animated Lord Of The Rings, because thats what I did and now I love this game. You have a control panel in front of you while navigating your hero throughout each quest. To the left you have the status of your character displaying armor and stats. In the middle, a mini map that lights up as you explore each room, this also serves as a quick point and click to get you across the level faster. On the right, the description and status of each tile, chest, monster or whatever you hover the mouse over.\n\nWith only the life you are given to start you must find chests or overturn dead bodies in order to find scrolls or potions to boost your health as well as other stats at the same time. These scrolls and potions are critical to gameplay and make Hack, Slash, Loot almost impossible to play without them. With 32 different classes to choose from, 6 unique quests, and an endless mixture of armor, weaponry and gear makes Hack, Slash, Loot an instant classic and a must have for any indie gamer.\n\nGraphics: 6/10\nPlayability: 7/10\nStory: 9/10\nChallenge: 8/10\nReplay Value: 7/10","October 10, 2013","true","12.2"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

Level layout and enemy generation both perfectly balance the procedural generation of a rogue-like with the intentionality of a well-designed level. Unfortunately, other randomized elements are less-than-perfect. With a peculiarly inverted difficulty curve, players will find the greatest initial challenge is persevering through the 25+ deaths required to unlock the first character truly capable of rewarding a player's skill with success. Each successive character is more powerful than the last, and although some strategy is necessary in combining character classes with various artifact 'loadouts,' most of the later unlocked characters make previous ones obsolete. Similarly, choosing wisely from the loot at the player's disposal requires careful consideration, but the randomness of enchantments and loot mean that a session typically ends in either frustrating defeat or unsatisfying triumph.\n\nOn the spectrum of skill vs chance, Hack, Slash, Loot is just a bit more random than most players will find rewarding. Nevertheless, there is a wealth of unlockables that may keep a determined gamer occupied for many hours. For its unique interface and enjoyable retro stylings, the game is commendable, but overall it comes off as a quirky experiment that doesn't quite make the cut.","May 16, 2014","true","36.8"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Realistically, how would any human fare trying to kill a dungeon full of ogres, undead skeletons or parasitic demons that burst out of his fallen comrades? The answer: he'd probably die long before reaching his goal.\n\nHSL's main feature is arguably the starting character choice and the initial artifact they can bring with them (in case they have unlocked it). You start out with 3 mostly crap characters and then you unlock more through either a) successfully clearing a session or b) dying a certain number of times until the next unlock threshold. For most people, their first few unlocks may be the death based ones.\n\nAn "interesting" design choice was the strengths/weaknesses of elements in the game. To sum it up, every element has a chance of doing some effect. If you're strong against the effect, you take half the damage and never suffer from the effect of that element; if you're weak, however, you take double damage and the chance of being applied the element's effect is increased. This comes with some very nasty consequences, such as being poisoned for a bad evasion roll or having a random piece of your equipment destroyed by fire. It gets even worse when you figure out that holy and dark elements' effect is applied when you kill something and that both give you health, increased accuracy (aka hit enemies more often) or even increased damage: the game is practically forcing you to find and stick to a holy/dark weapon combo of melee, ranged or magic varieties, since randomly finding a potion and carelessly using it without knowing what its affix might do is bound to either screw all you've worked for or not heal you when you'd really want some health.\n\nHSL also starts handing you characters that are arguably better for specific dungeons or have gameplay variability to help you find your niche. One particular character has intrinsically magic resistance, for instance: you'd definitely want to bring him to at least two of the dungeons for that reason alone. But on the other hand, every character is more or less gimped in some way, and the arguable best stat to stock upon is armour (which, unfortunately, is more likely to come from your randomly dropped equipment than it is from being boosted from a potion) because it is applied BEFORE strengths and weaknesses come into play.\n\nAs for the artifacts, the undeniably best all-around one is the Mask of SomeMummyGuy (name forgotten, not the actual name), the goal from the crypt dungeon and forever unlocked once obtained. There is no real reason not to bring it with you either, since it boasts an incredible amount of armour and reasonable stat boosts for your offensive ability. Compare to the Butcher's Knife, which makes you walk twice a turn but does such an insignificant amount of damage that you'll be seeing the numbers 1 or 2 popping out when you attack something, or the Necronomicon, which if you aren't a melee character or don't have holy or dark weapons means you will also be hitting a lot less for the "benefit" of being able to pass through walls (which may sound nice, but on most of the dungeons it simply means that if you don't clear a room FAST the monsters are going to start opening doors EVERYWHERE and the entire level is going to make a never-ending conga line to beat you up).\n\nAlso keep in mind, my worst gripe with HSL isn't about the gameplay but the accuracy of targetting itself, a game mechanic. As you may see from the screenshots, tiles are rectangular: they are wider than taller by a ratio of aproximately 2. And when you want to click on something, you HAVE to click on their bottom half, because otherwise you'd be targetting the tile above it. It also doesn't help that targetting a tile to move that is far away AFTER having seen a threat doesn't cancel the order to move unless you click again or are hit by a monster, and if you are trying to attack from a range that will mean you will most certainly get hit before you realize that you are moving instead of attacking, and that in itself will usually get you killed since ranged characters tend not to have the best survival up close.\n\nBut, as I said on the opening line, HSL is a decent rogue-like. Not too deep about it nor very long-lasting, but if you like rogue-likes you may enjoy it. Should you buy HSL? Maybe. Maybe on a 75% discount. I still hate the inefficient targetting system and how hard it is to move long stretches of the dungeon when you're on the last rooms to find the stairs, pixel-clicking on the map or hitting the wrong tile. If you think you can handle it go for it; don't bother otherwise.","June 19, 2014","true","47.0"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

I mean--really.  It could have been so good.\n\nBut, the movement-combat mechanism, combined with the rogue-like randomness, makes it an exericise in frustration.  The "mechanic", in this case, is how your character attacks and moves.  I've played the old ASCII rogue-like game "ADOM", and it has exactly this same mechanism; you'd think that the developers could have come up with something other than a mechanism identical to one that's been in place for the last 20+ years.  This mechanism, lIke most similar games, functions where each attack or movement takes roughly equal "turns", for both you and your opponents.  This means that you will get into situations where you can't out-run your opponents, reducing the combat to simply a matter of "trading shots."\n\nUnfortunately, depending on your class selection, you will be "trading shots" either a lot, or all the time, which means a unfortunate roll of the dice will effectively (or definitively) end your run.  This mechanism, in combiation with the lack of any RPG elements to provide value to "wasted" runs, means this becomes a glorified dice roller.\n\nYou're better off playing any number of better rogue-like games.

Also you must rely on RNG to determine whether or not you can restore your health, as the only way to do so is to find potions which randomly spawn in chests.

I am going to give my honest thoughts about the game, and help people understand the game.\n\nFirst off, the graphic they look like they're from "Realm of the Mad God" and "Legends of Yore". That's because it is. Sure people can say that's a downside, but it could also be a plus side. Seeing how it's simple and easy to know the enemy you're trying to fight. Another thing is how the fog is. At times, you can see something, but not be able to shoot it with your bow or staff.\n\nThe soundtrack has seven tracks. No joke. I got the soundtrack from the Humble Bundle I got the game from, and it is good when you first hear it, it can be a pain hearing the same few tracks more than needed. But, the game does have one track that does help. When the track plays, that means there's five or more enemies in the room.\n\nOkay, now, let's talk the gameplay. If you want to know, yes. It is a rogue-like game. The levels are randomly made as you play through the game. However, the game doesn't have one solid story like "The Binding of Isaac" did. This game has quite a few different stories that you can pick from, each with how to go through and manage the game. One story has a ton of tombs that you can look at for items, with another one with being a tower that a giant wizard use to live. They all mostly look the game, but little touches make it seem different.\n\nNow, the buttom of the screen is everything, and I mean everything. Your settings, your stats, your map, your bloodtype, everything. You move around with the mouse, and you do everything with the mouse. You might be able to play this with a touchscreen, but I'm not to sure. Along with picking your story you want to play through, you can pick which character to play with. Each one is different and unique. You can unlock more if you do some tasks, like dying twenty times (I'm not kidding). Some characters work best with some stories because of the items you can get in the story.\n\nCombat is what might make a lot of people mad. Whenever you move a space, all rendered enemies will also move a space. So, think of it as a game of chess, planning out where to move and when to strike your opponents. To actually deal damage on your opponent is as simple as clicking on them. If you have a melee weapon, you have to be next to them, if your have a ranged or staff weapon, you can be as far away as you can (but, still visible on screen). If you hover your mouse over the enemy, you can see their stats on the right side of the menu on the buttom of the screen.\n\nTo be honest, I wish I remembered how the stats work and how you can calculate your damage output. It is a pain when you start, but if you get this game, I recommend using Amazon (unlocked by dying twenty times), and using her on the story "Mask of the Boy King". This game isn't for everybody, but if you like rogue-like games, you might like this. However, I recommend getting it on sale or in a Humble Bundle, it isn't worth the full price. But, one last note, you can run this 8MB game on anything. I bet you can run it on a Raspberry Pi, I seriously think you can. But, with that said, I do like it. It is a game to play when you're waiting for updates to finish.","June 5, 2014","true","11.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It is a game that essentially boils down what it means to be a game to its simplest level. Step one: Left click. Step two: Left click. Are you dead? Restart. Go to step one.\n\nWhile the game boasts multiple classes and multiple quests, there are almost zero differences to be found regardless of your choice. There are no activatable abilities, of any nature. Combat is all dice rolling against your accuracy, which can begin at a pitiful 60% base chance to hit. Monster variety consists of melee or ranged, and what element they might hit you with or be weak to. Everything else boils down to dealing out and taking increasingly larger numbers of damage.\n\nYour only stats are accuracy, damage, health, and defense. In almost all cases, every item or consumable will simply futz with those numbers a bit. Or, give you weakness/resistance to an element, which is of limited utility. A very rare find will give you two actions per turn. This is about the only time actual tactics are involved, as otherwise everything moves just as fast as you do.\n\nMaking matters worse, friendly NPCs can make certain quests nearly unplayably obnoxious for their ability to get in your way, die, and spawn a ghost who will turn on you.\n\nEssentially, Hack Slash Loot brought in the worst parts of classic Rogue games, but somewhere along the way forgot to add in the things that make them fun.\n\nHere's a video with a look at the gameplay:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raXofWn2ayY","January 28, 2014","false","1.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This game does not feel like a completed product.\n\nAudio\nThis game lacks music. Most of your gameplay is filled with digital squeeks and sfx of the character's actions. The sounds get monotonous and boring.\n\nGameplay\nThis game is not repetitive for a dungeon crawler. This is good. The game was enjoyable for the first few hours. However, you'll realize that the randomly generated maps are at times impossible to complete. For example, you start a new game, and you spawn right next to a hobgoblin. You'll die. You won't be able to kill it, not with getting artifacts. The chances of getting artifacts are very low, considering that you'll have much more difficulty in trying to survive the first level, let alone trying to find artifacts.\n\nYou might be complaining that these "vanilla" gamers don't know what difficult is. Well, if you take the example of spawning next to a hobgoblin, you don't have a chance in playing the game. You could either open doors and run away, not knowing whether the next room would be filled with enemies or weapons to aid in your quest, or you could face the enemy and try killing it, dying in the process. This "fated death" does not represent what difficult is.\n\nThe good news is, such situations does not occur frequently. In my opinion, the gameplay does not leave much to be desired. The randomness did not seemed to be well thought of.\n\nGraphics\nI had a huge problem with the minimap. At full screen, the mini map was, too mini. You might be thinking, this guy is nuts! It's a mini map, what more do you need? Well, the issue is you can't adjust the size of the minimap. The minimap is important in this game because it shows you the loot, the unopened doors, and the stairs. You can also click on the minimap to move your character to the far side of the room effortlessly. A small minimap was just straining to the eyes.\n\nOverall, information in the hub (or whatever you call it) is dense and it will take you some time to get used to it. This isn't a bad thing. Some players may find that the hub is "busy" because there are a lot of things going on.\nYou can't really experience this by looking at the screenshots of the game. You have to play it to know what I'm trying to say. When you get into a room with tons of enemies, you may want to choose, say, the easiest to kill/most lethal to take down first. To do that, you gotta hover through each enemy to look at their descriptions, comparing their atk/def with your atk/def to determine the likelihood of you hitting it. This process isn't made easy based on the design of the hub. Again, it takes quite some getting used to.","January 25, 2014","false","5.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

You also choose the quest you want to play from the main menu, and each has its own story. But everytime you play one of these quests, the dungeon is different, since they're procedurally generated.

This game does not feel like a completed product.\n\nAudio\nThis game lacks music. Most of your gameplay is filled with digital squeeks and sfx of the character's actions. The sounds get monotonous and boring.\n\nGameplay\nThis game is not repetitive for a dungeon crawler. This is good. The game was enjoyable for the first few hours. However, you'll realize that the randomly generated maps are at times impossible to complete. For example, you start a new game, and you spawn right next to a hobgoblin. You'll die. You won't be able to kill it, not with getting artifacts. The chances of getting artifacts are very low, considering that you'll have much more difficulty in trying to survive the first level, let alone trying to find artifacts.\n\nYou might be complaining that these "vanilla" gamers don't know what difficult is. Well, if you take the example of spawning next to a hobgoblin, you don't have a chance in playing the game. You could either open doors and run away, not knowing whether the next room would be filled with enemies or weapons to aid in your quest, or you could face the enemy and try killing it, dying in the process. This "fated death" does not represent what difficult is.\n\nThe good news is, such situations does not occur frequently. In my opinion, the gameplay does not leave much to be desired. The randomness did not seemed to be well thought of.\n\nGraphics\nI had a huge problem with the minimap. At full screen, the mini map was, too mini. You might be thinking, this guy is nuts! It's a mini map, what more do you need? Well, the issue is you can't adjust the size of the minimap. The minimap is important in this game because it shows you the loot, the unopened doors, and the stairs. You can also click on the minimap to move your character to the far side of the room effortlessly. A small minimap was just straining to the eyes.\n\nOverall, information in the hub (or whatever you call it) is dense and it will take you some time to get used to it. This isn't a bad thing. Some players may find that the hub is "busy" because there are a lot of things going on.\nYou can't really experience this by looking at the screenshots of the game. You have to play it to know what I'm trying to say. When you get into a room with tons of enemies, you may want to choose, say, the easiest to kill/most lethal to take down first. To do that, you gotta hover through each enemy to look at their descriptions, comparing their atk/def with your atk/def to determine the likelihood of you hitting it. This process isn't made easy based on the design of the hub. Again, it takes quite some getting used to.","January 25, 2014","false","5.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Its presence, forever a taint on my library.\n\nAvoid this game, for this game is precision crafted to avoid literally everything good about roguelikes ever. Hack, Slash, Loot is such a bad roguelike that it can be considered the anti-roguelike, the embodiment of all the bad parts of roguelikes with none of the good whatsoever.\n\nThe game lacks any sort of mechanical depth whatsoever. Everything boils down to boring, static numbers. Where a better roguelike would have classes that play differently, different skills perhaps, equipment preferences and the like, the ability to use magic perhaps, this game has none of those things. And I'm not saying that a roguelike has to have those things, you understand. I'm saying that most fantasy roguelikes would have those things, for instance Dungeons of Dredmor and Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup. Even within the "Roguelite" games, you'd have characters with a vastly different playstyle resulting from different skillsets, stats and starting equipment, like in The Binding of Isaac, Risk of Rain, Nuclear Throne, Ziggurat, the list goes on.\n\nHack, Slash, Loot instead has classes that boil down to melee and ranged, no resting to regain your health, no skills, no mana. Your character is simply a walking sheet of stats, bolstered by your equipment that are nothing but stats. This creates no interesting gameplay choices, either you find something that has better stats than your current equipment, or you don't. There is no strategy, there is no way to build your character, there is no game to be enjoyed here.\n\nThis creates a game that is nothing but dice rolls upon dice rolls, with little to no player input involved. There is no feeling of accomplishment if you get further than you previously did, there is no anguish when you die. You cannot self reflect on a defeat that was entirely out of your control, you cannot ask yourself what you could've done better.\n\nThe beauty of a roguelike is its nigh infinite replayability, the ways you can experiment with builds, the magic of discovery as you find something that works, figure out the tricks of the game, and get further everytime. The excitement when you turn a bad run around after an item that perfectly synergizes with your current character appears, or the opposite, where you make it far, even perhaps to the final level, before dying. Lamenting that you would've won if you had the right items. And what about the times when you pull through a bad run? That is the core of the roguelike experience that Hack, Slash, Loot ultimately fails to capture.\n\nIn conclusion, Hack, Slash, Loot is a thoroughly incompetent roguelike that tries to distill the experience, but what you instead get is a shallow game with no identity, no soul. It is a bad game, it is a bad roguelike, and you should avoid it like the plague.","June 27, 2015","false","0.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Doing well on a run when you know the odds can be against you? That's a truely gratifying experience. You're not really breaking your wallet on this one.\n\nDon't let all the negative comments push you away, consider this game!

I could sit here and try to name many more games, all of which use random elements. In some your attacks always hit as long as you aim it right. Usually though it is based on chance whether you hit somebody or not, and how much damage you do. To improve your chances you improve your stats. Nearly all games rely on random elements such as item drops, enemy spawning, and more. This one just puts it more up front and in your face than most others.\n\nYou didn't always get your way in Nethack, or any of the older roguelikes. The same can be said for any new RPG, roguelike, or a mix of both, such as Spelunky or Binding of Isaac. You had to keep going, and hope that you got lucky enough for good items, easy enemies, a good floor layout, etc. You strategized what to do from there, based on what the game decided to throw at you. The only thing I feel it really needs would probably have to be longer chapters/areas, the ability to continue going on after defeating a boss, or some sort of infinite dungeon.\n\nIn my opinion I think that, while it does need improvements, tweaks, and hopefully more content, this game offers a view to the more classic idea of roguelikes. I'm definitely keeping my eye on this one.\n\n( I play this DRM free and not on steam, hence the low play time. )","January 31, 2014","true","4.2"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

It looks like it should be a nice game, and while it does have its charm, but just not enough to make up for its flaws.\n\nPROS:\n-A number of artifacts, once you find one, you can choose to start with that artifact in any future game.\n-A nice weapon/armor material system, silver weapons disarm foes, gold weapons give you stat bonuses occasionally, psychic weapons causes stat drain, among other things\n-A couple of nice references to other (better) games in the form of some artifacts and uncommon rooms (such as an Aperture test chamber and I'm pretty sure I saw the castle crashers knights once)\n-Despite not having an inventory (kind of a good thing, to be honest-it leads to less of the hoarding mentality many RPGs end up with) it does have a secondary weapon slot, and you can switch between the two easily, which I thought was a nice little feature.\n\nCONS:\n-Melee is awful-seriously, there's almost no reason to use it.\n-combat is dull and repetetive (there's literally nothing beyond 'attack' and 'move')\n-more than one or two friendly NPCs completely bog down the pace of the game\n-Unlocking more characters seems to be completely random\n-Death is frequent, not because the game is hard, but because healing is almost exclusively availible from random potions/scrolls/food (and the occasional vampiric weapon) and there's no garauntee you'll find anything that actually works well with your main combat stat. also poison is effectively incurable-if you can't survive until it passes on its own, you're dead.\n\n\nWhile the game is flawed, it's still somewhat enjoyable if you stay away from the melee characters and the Battle for Stormrise quest.

The problem is that this might be the first and only game where you can only unlock characters by dieing. So get ready to farm hundreds and hundreds of deaths before you can actually have a chance of any fun. Oh, and be careful for the un-winnable scenarios. I loved spending an hour in a dungeon only to make a single wrong step and game over. If you get poisoned, it stays forever, ticking away health every step until you die.

Be prepared to miss with your attacks a lot, often in streaks of 10 or more in a row.  Also be ready to have very little health, and not many opportunities to refill it or increase it.  As you descend the enemies get harder and harder, and they get more cheap with their attack powers, such as poison that can take off half your health over time, fire attacks that can also destroy your equipment, and lighting attacks that can chain stun-lock you.\n\nThere is also no leveling system, you gain (and loose) attributes from equipment, which is further modified scrolls, potions, and altars.  The loot in general is also very boring and uninteresting, and you will often see the same equipment you didn't want over and over again.  The best part is that to unlock extra characters, the game expects you to die over and over again.  You start with 3 out of 32 characters unlocked.\n\nI cannot recommend this game on any level.","August 27, 2014","false","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197996145276/recommended/207430/","76561197996145276","Ayon","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197996145276/","1007 products in account","Hack, Slash, Loot is a nice little turn based dungeon crawler.\n\nAbout gameplay The maps and the loot and monsters therein are always randomly generated, which at the beginning can be quite frustrating as you have a steep learning curve as to how this game exactly "works." Since you start out with rather weak characters (you unlock new ones by dying in/failing a quest) the game seems rather frustrating. But don't let that ruin your experience as you advance you'll unlock new characters and get to the fun/challenge of the game rather quickly and more easily.\n\nThe game completely bypasses difficult and complex skill and stat systems for a rather basic approach. You have 2 stats per weapon class (Attack Chance/Attack Damage) a defense skill and health. In addition to the stats there's an "elemental system." You can either cause, resist or have a vulnerability to one of the 7 damage types; silvered, fire, lightening, poison, divine, necrotic and psychic. And that's it.\n\nIf you start the game up you'll first decide with which kind of character you want to play (32 in total once all are unlocked. You unlock new ones every N^2 deaths) you'll then decide what quest you want to approach (there are currently 6) and what artifacts to take with you (once you found any).\n\nDepending on these choices you also set the difficulty for your game. Melee characters are hard to play with (since they need to get close first), ranged characters have a medium difficulty (since they can shoot from afar) and wizards are easier to play with (since their shots penetrate armor if the enemy hasn't got an enchantement against it). Depending on their starting elements or enchantements they also add or substract from the difficulty, based on which quest you are approaching. It'd, for example, be quite foolish to try and attempt the "They Dwell beneath" Quest, wherein you go out to hunt down 5 dragons in a mountain, with a starting character or artifact that makes you vulnerable towards fire damage.\n\nArtifacts are found in specific encounters throughout the game or by finishing certain quests. Artifacts stay with you and can be selected as starting gear making your life significantly easier.\n\nWith all this in mind the games actual gameplay is rather simple but shines in one particular aspect: choice. In every quest there are 5 levels with certain enemies of certain quantities but they are nonetheless of the same kind. With this in mind the biggest challenge of the game is to take or not to take risks. As the "Loot" aspect in the title of the game suggests it makes you think rather hard on what to use and what not to use; "Are you taking this shield with you that makes you less likely to hit enemies and makes you vulnerable to psychic damage but gives you a steady defense stat that'll continually help you out whenever you are hit and in addition makes you resistant to poison?" or "Do I drink this potion which name doesn't suggest neither positive nor negative effects that could heal my low health but also make me vulnerable towards the current enemies most common element and therefor kill me?" are examples of the most common and frequent choices in the game.\n\nA lot of other people think this game is "unfair" to them but it really isn't. It is true that a lot of luck and chance is involved in the game, however this feeling of "unfairness" will usually go away once you've understood the game and beaten it once or twice. While it is based on chance and luck a lot you'll, as it is always the case with luck and chance, on >average< succeed quite steadily. That's what odds are all about. If you get into the game a bit statements will quickly go from:"Stupid game always spawns too many enemies and no good loot," to:"Maybe I should've taken that other helm with me instead and risk being poisened so that I'd have received less normal damage by upping my defence."\n\nSound and Graphics Some words about sound and graphics: The graphics usually don't exceed the 10x10 Pixel boundary per sprite or background element so don't expect too much even though it features fantastic and distinctive design within this limitation and the sound is really nice. This is actually the only thing that bugs me: The music doesn't consecutively play throughout the game but rather plays one soundloop on occasion. Starting a quest? Soundtrack 1 loops once. Found a big amount of enemies? Soundtrack for danger loops once. And so on. I'd have wished for a soundtrack that stayed with me for the entirety of a playthrough whenever there is no occasion for a loop. However the effects are nice and will kind of feel like a soundtrack after a while.\n\nIs this a game for me? So all in all: If you are NOT easily frustrated when confronted with chellange or a little bad luck, you like roguelikes and turn based dungeon crawlers or simply crave for a little bit of "something else" then please give this game a try. It'll surely not disappoint.\n\nIf you are easily bored or frustrated when confronted with chellange or a little bad luck stay far away from this game.","August 27, 2014","true","14.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's not unwinnable, I certainly managed to win it. I stopped playing the game because it became too easy for me, but that's because I have a lot of good gear (due to winning the game) and knowledge about the game after playing for 80 hours. I was very persistent and I learned more every time I died.\n\nI must be one of the few people who really enjoyed this game. I greatly enjoyed the challenge and tried to get just a little further each time, before finally making it. Roguelike perma-death games that reward you for trying and trying are quite hilarious.\n\nThis game only lets you have a small amount of gear, but the gear is vital. The combination of gear lets you take less (or more) damage from certain types of damage, as well as improving your ability to hurt stuff.\n\nThere's a ton of luck involved, but a lot of skill. As I played more and more, I realised which classes worked well on which levels. I worked out when to fully explore certain areas with certain classes and when to rush to the next area.\n\nSome people won't like this game because of the graphics, and that's certainly one downside. Others won't like this game because it's repetitive and because you only have the ability to only carry a small amount of loot.\n\nI loved the game because of the challenge of the game, the complex simplicity of the gear management, and the huge amount of enjoyment I got when I started winning games.","September 9, 2014","true","79.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It looks like it should be a nice game, and while it does have its charm, but just not enough to make up for its flaws.\n\nPROS:\n-A number of artifacts, once you find one, you can choose to start with that artifact in any future game.\n-A nice weapon/armor material system, silver weapons disarm foes, gold weapons give you stat bonuses occasionally, psychic weapons causes stat drain, among other things\n-A couple of nice references to other (better) games in the form of some artifacts and uncommon rooms (such as an Aperture test chamber and I'm pretty sure I saw the castle crashers knights once)\n-Despite not having an inventory (kind of a good thing, to be honest-it leads to less of the hoarding mentality many RPGs end up with) it does have a secondary weapon slot, and you can switch between the two easily, which I thought was a nice little feature.\n\nCONS:\n-Melee is awful-seriously, there's almost no reason to use it.\n-combat is dull and repetetive (there's literally nothing beyond 'attack' and 'move')\n-more than one or two friendly NPCs completely bog down the pace of the game\n-Unlocking more characters seems to be completely random\n-Death is frequent, not because the game is hard, but because healing is almost exclusively availible from random potions/scrolls/food (and the occasional vampiric weapon) and there's no garauntee you'll find anything that actually works well with your main combat stat. also poison is effectively incurable-if you can't survive until it passes on its own, you're dead.\n\n\nWhile the game is flawed, it's still somewhat enjoyable if you stay away from the melee characters and the Battle for Stormrise quest. Playing as a Pixie Mage wearing plate armor and using a gun to shoot weapons out of your enemies hands is hard not to enjoy.","April 1, 2014","false","13.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Your only way to power up in this game is to find random loot and better upgrades as you explore these random-generating dungeons.

The mechanics of the game are somewhat light although the big picture of the game is to stay alive and make smart choices when it comes to battling monsters and maintaining your health points. The armor weapons and items you find in game offer tons of support and help you best the set of quests before you, but some items can also have cons associated with them. The random outcomes of the doors you choose can have a heavy impact on whether or not you die or make it to the next floor.

I only got this as part of a Humble Bundle so I decided to give it a try and it is just too frustrating. The enemies seem to do as much if not no damage than you, and the worst part is that you don't level up like in a D&D game. So killing enemies is pointless unless you come across them, or for that rare occurance if you wish to duke one out for a piece of crappy gear which more likely than not will be a dowgrade rather than an upgrade. If the game had a leveling system for a reason to kill the enemies and a small party system where smart AI NPCs could play with you. Especially a spell system so you can cast spells to heal or kill enemies.\n\nSo long story short. This feels like a D&D game written poorly and could of done way better. If they make a second which I hope they do as a fix for this one. They will use some of the suggestions I listed even though I doubt they will read it. I was hoping for a fun 8-bit D&D clone and got this instead.","February 3, 2014","false","1.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The overall setting of the game can be changed with the quest in the beginning of the game, although you have the option of choosing your class and quest on the title screen you also have the awesome option of setting it all to random making your next quest and class a surprise. The mechanics of the game are somewhat light although the big picture of the game is to stay alive and make smart choices when it comes to battling monsters and maintaining your health points. The armor weapons and items you find in game offer tons of support and help you best the set of quests before you, but some items can also have cons associated with them. The random outcomes of the doors you choose can have a heavy impact on whether or not you die or make it to the next floor. I noticed that the ranged classes usually survive longer due to being able to bottleneck enemies in doorways and blast them from the safety of a long hallway. Overall Hack, Slash, Loot is an update of an older vision of games long lost in a crowd of easy shooters and games that play themselves.","January 28, 2014","true","1.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Its appealingly nostalgic looking, fairly accessible, and charmingly simple - cutting back on a lot of roguelike conventions without losing the main idea. Looting and getting stronger is predictably addictive.\n\nUnfortunately it still feels unpolished and balanced poorly, and the worst offender is the fact that there are just relatively few meaningful actions for the player to consider and take throughout a playthrough. Questions a player faces are two: whether or not to engage, or whether or not to equip - and the answers to those questions are often strikingly obvious. I also haven't found a single practical reason yet to focus on melee over ranged weaponry. That fact combined with a relatively common boost makes the experience very simple to game.\n\nIn some was HSL feels like an iOS casual game, with a veneer of hardcore trappings, minus the in-app purchases.

It looks like it should be a nice game, and while it does have its charm, but just not enough to make up for its flaws.\n\nPROS:\n-A number of artifacts, once you find one, you can choose to start with that artifact in any future game.\n-A nice weapon/armor material system, silver weapons disarm foes, gold weapons give you stat bonuses occasionally, psychic weapons causes stat drain, among other things\n-A couple of nice references to other (better) games in the form of some artifacts and uncommon rooms (such as an Aperture test chamber and I'm pretty sure I saw the castle crashers knights once)\n-Despite not having an inventory (kind of a good thing, to be honest-it leads to less of the hoarding mentality many RPGs end up with) it does have a secondary weapon slot, and you can switch between the two easily, which I thought was a nice little feature.\n\nCONS:\n-Melee is awful-seriously, there's almost no reason to use it.\n-combat is dull and repetetive (there's literally nothing beyond 'attack' and 'move')\n-more than one or two friendly NPCs completely bog down the pace of the game\n-Unlocking more characters seems to be completely random\n-Death is frequent, not because the game is hard, but because healing is almost exclusively availible from random potions/scrolls/food (and the occasional vampiric weapon) and there's no garauntee you'll find anything that actually works well with your main combat stat. also poison is effectively incurable-if you can't survive until it passes on its own, you're dead.\n\n\nWhile the game is flawed, it's still somewhat enjoyable if you stay away from the melee characters and the Battle for Stormrise quest.

I really do.  I've played a good few, and I enjoy a desperate struggle with limited resources, where every choice matters and one bad move can ruin an entire run.  I like to have to make hard decisions and cheat death through careful planning, frantic improvisation and the rare lucky break.\n\nHack Slash Loot is the antithesis of those things.\n\nUnless the game has undergone a  total makeover in terms of design since I last played it, it's a broken, pointless roguelike in which you stand absolutely no chance in hell of surviving (unless you get lucky and get a Holy/Virtue element weapon that boosts your stats with each hit, right at the start of your run).\n\nThe most potent strategy you have is "Stand in front of a doorway to fight the enemies one on one, and pray that the guys stuck behind the guy you're hitting don't loop around and flank you before you kill them all one at a time".  You can't even RUN.  The enemies chase you forever like homing missiles and will not stop until you've bopped them on the head enough to kill them.  There's no class-specific skills to use and manage either.  It's all about the items you find and pick up.  And getting them?  Random.  There are virtually no hard choices in the game.  Just roll the dice and pray you make it.\n\nIt's like playing russian roulette with a fully loaded gun.  There is no skill.  Only luck.  Winning (Or even PROGRESS) is impossible unless you get insanely lucky.\n\nIf you want a roguelike, go play FTL (a much better game), or Dungeons of dredmor.  Hell, if you want an action-based roguelike, Eldritch is pretty good and actually takes skills and quick thinking to beat.  Go play those or the many other good roguelikes out there.

One life, one game. The graphics are very 8-bit-ish but the game is fun enough, if you don't mind dying a lot. Unfortunately you can only control the game via mouse-clicks or arrow keys. There should be keybinding options. But meh, it's still a fun game.","January 3, 2015","true","18.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Both times didn’t last very long… As you can tell by my total play time of an hour. I’m just gonna be straight and say I don’t like this game. But the fact that I’m reviewing it after an hour should be more than enough evidence of that.\n\nThe main issues I have with Hack, Slash, Loot stem from the fact that it is based entirely around luck, it’s rather shallow, and frankly it’s just unengaging. Also I wanted to play it more, but it’s now continuously crashing; thus preventing me from even giving the game another chance. It’s almost as if the game knows I’m not fond of it and it’s hiding from further examination!\n\nCrashing aside Hack, Slash, Loot definitely has some cool ideas, but the game’s execution could definitely have used some work. When the game launches, after you’ve taken about five minutes to parse the UI, you can pick from a rather large selection of quests-- these are essentially the game’s ‘campaigns’; and four character classes. The game’s various quests are really just a set of parameters on the random dungeon generation. Apparently the dungeons span multiple floors and also contain bosses but I’ve never lived long enough to see one…\n\nThis is because the game pits you off against a nearly unending horde of monsters that do far too much damage, have way too much health, and almost comically out number you. Plus healing items are few and far between due to the random nature of the game’s loot. In the hour I’ve played I’ve probably run through thirty or forty dungeons.\n\nLet that sink in.\n\nMy longest run was probably 20 minutes, and I still never made it past the first floor. Hell, I’ve died in the room that I spawned in.\n\nFighting hordes of powerful enemies can definitely be fun, other games prove this. But Hack, Slash, Loot’s reliance on luck permeates into the combat as well. Even with a 60% chance to hit I find myself missing the majority of my shots. A fight with a single monster can take upwards of ten turns or more, which are spent watching your character and the monster haplessly flail at one another only occasionally connecting. Once you finally land a hit and damage to the monster you have to hope that you roll well... or you’ll find yourself dealing almost no damage, making the fight take even longer.\n\nThere’s nothing like missing ten attacks only to land one and deal 2 damage.\n\nThe best way I can describe this game is that it feels like a Pen and Paper RPG, like Pathfinder… But without any of the systems that actually allow you to do the cool stuff.\n\nThere are no modifiers that help your dice rolls, or give you an edge. It’s just raw randomness.\n\nMost of the time you simply rely on luck, and hope that the five orcs breathing down your neck miss more than you do. Or that you get a good weapon that can deal decent damage. But that only happened to me once, and then I promptly died.\n\nThis game definitely has potential. And it’s clearly there under the layers of randomness… But  as it stands Hack, Slash, Loot isn’t worth your time.","May 19","false","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

People complain about RNG, but honestly thats just part of the game. My main issues with the game were the complete lack of a list of controls or menu system. You have to learn the controls from an external website, there is no way of learning them in game. The diaglogue systemis clunky and only displays the past 3 actions. If you want a more indepth much more varied rogue like try Stone soup. Google it. Its completely free, much more complex and in depth, and personally much more fun. Avoid this.","June 3","false","0.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
