"http://steamcommunity.com/id/alexisplaying/recommended/352610/","alexisplaying","Shinsuke Nakamura","http://steamcommunity.com/id/alexisplaying/","1532 products in account","This VN has the typical setup of the main character returning to town for a few days after being away for a few years. You spend your time back visiting two girls each with very different personalities. One is your typical loud & fun loving girl (Amu) and the other is the shy & reserved type (Noelle). There are a decent amount of choices to be made. Start to finish clocked in at 61 minutes for me, I could see it being around 90 minutes or so if you're a slower reader. There are also 21 endings to see!\n\nThat being said the game suffers from Subpar artwork (downright horrid in some places), Terrible Music & an incredible amount of filler that drags some scenes on for far too long. I was practically falling asleep at my PC reading this. With faults like that, why would I recommend this VN? The answer is simple. The final chapter. The game takes quite a turn fast and suddenly these faults take a backseat to the chain of events that happen. I don't want to say what exactly because that would spoil the fun but trust me it's absolutely mental and made this worthwhile. I went from falling asleep to the edge of my seat in 30 seconds flat. If you're an anime watcher, I'll just say that this is the "School Days" of VNs. Glad I bought it.\n\nEdit: 5/21 endings now. All of which are very well done. Most things struggle to have a satisfying ending, but at this rate this VN is going to have 21 of them. It's just a shame that the first 70% of it is so bland.","March 24, 2015","true","1.5"," 46 of 50 people (92%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","92","46","50","5","2"

Despite the twists and turns, you can say 'I see how I arrived here' in the end. It was surprising to see how simple choices had a major impact on the story and you arrived at different endings.\n\nAt the completion of some endings, there is a little behind the scenes or after story. It explains some of what happened before or shows what happens after the ending. Again the detail that went into all this is impressive. It all fits so well together and really is an excellent story / game / VN.\n\n\nThe only down side I found was some of the dialog was long - that is just me though, a little impatient. There is an option to skip thorough that dialog which is helpful particularly if you have already gone through that chain once before.\n\nSo if you are wondering if you should get this, the answer is: Yes. ... and prepare to have a not so happy but incredible adventure.","May 30, 2015","true","19.5"," 30 of 30 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","30","30","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Nishastra/recommended/352610/","Nishastra","Bit Risky","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Nishastra/","760 products in account","The Way We ALL GO is a visual novel about a shy, generally incompetent boy returning to his small-town home for a few days after two years in the city.  He meets up with old friends and neighbors and hopefully makes up for old mistakes that he had been running away from.\n\nThe Way We ALL GO is hard not to compare to Higurashi, at least initially.  It has a similar setting with some similar elements and the backgrounds in particular would fit perfectly in the original version of Higurashi.  Even the name and blood-splatter theme of the UI evoke Higurashi somewhat.\n\nHowever, the game itself is decidedly not a Higurashi ripoff.  For starters, it has choices.  Lots of them.  There are 21 endings in total and the routes leading to them vary significantly, especially for that 21st ending.  Also, the story remains rooted in something resembling reality.\n\nThe game does get violent sometimes, as the blood-splatters imply, but I wouldn't say that's the point of the game.  I've certainly played some VNs whose stories seemed more like an excuse for torture porn than an actual narrative, but thankfully this is not one of them.  It is more than possible to achieve an actual happy ending.\n\nThe game can take a while to get going.  Sometimes it feels like it takes about twice as long as it needs to in order to get something across in a conversation.  However, once you get through the early game and can start working through the endings, it really picks up.  I was pretty down on it early on, to be honest, but in the end I genuinely think this is one of the better western VNs I've played.\n\nP.S.

To really enjoy it, you need to like strong narratives and character driven plots.\n\nBut this little slice of life, quirky game drew me in, with characters that had depth and moments where I, the player, had to make a choice completely drawing me in. It also helps that there are 21 ENDINGS, and the first one I got came so completely out of the blue (#6) that I just had to find the rest, since the story is set up so that you know there's more to discover than you can on a single playthrough.\n\nGraphically, it's anime-ish with some still pictures, changing expressions and watercolour backgrounds. The hairstyles are very anime, but realism doesn't seem to be the goal here. Instead, it's a unique, immersive little experience. It'd be nice to see this game get more reviews and support, since production values are smooth and professional.\n\nIf I still feel the same after playing through all 21 endings, I might amend my statement. However, the game also has some handy little features (like letting you skip dialogue) to make repeat playthroughs more bearable.\n\nThe only thing I would say I dislike is that if this turns into a love sim type experience, it feels as though the developers expects the player to favour one girl over another, and in my case I prefer the other character. This can lead to making some choices in the game out of belligerence and getting annoyed if the game's responding text reprimands you. This was also present in the demo!\n\nHowever, if you like visual novels I'd say give this a go.","April 12, 2015","true","5.8"," 16 of 17 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","16","17","0","0"

Although, I do not recommend this game if you feel triggered about violence, blood, depression, paranoia… If you don’t mind, go for it without fear: the game is so good and worth to pay the full price.\n\nI love how the art style is cute, but the story itself is a different thing.

I saw quirky drawings and as soon as I opened the game I heared kind of annoying soundtrack. And it could've been the end to my experience with it, but I gave it a shot anyway. And - ohboi! - I don't regret it.\nThe game follows a story of a shy and insecure guy Attchan who comes back to his homevillage to visit his grandparents for just three days. While there, the character decides to visit (or, as one of the option states, not to) his childhood friends: Amu and Noele. It sounds kinda basic, but if I go without any spoilers, I'd say that there is a very interesting kind of chracters hiding behind such a basic concept. Really, just read it for yourselfs, through all the filler episodes and a boring start. This novel has an advantage of being short, just about 3 and a half hours (if you read in carefully) to get one ending. There are not that many differences between endings concerning the actual story, just a few more scenes or episodes, but it is satisfying.\nWhat really helps the game is it's soundtrack. It does sound cheap, but it fits perfectly with the spirit of the whole story, so that's why it works.\nHowever, the main con of the game is it's sprites and drawings. When characters are descent (just slightly above average), the backgrounds are terrible and seem just like photos rendered with a filter. But, as bad as it may sound, it doesn't really matter, as that simply what it is: a background. It doesn't spoil the story, and that's what matters.\n\nOverall, I'll admit that this is, by far, one of the best visual novels I've ever read, and I've read A LOT of them. This one's short, full of emotions, good memorable characters and atmospheric soundtrack. If only the drawings could've been better, we would've had ourselves a perfect visual novel of it's kind.\n8.5-9/10\n\nP.S.  Noelle is the best, even with that little box cutter of hers and blood on her hands.","July 26, 2015","true","6.0"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

You then meet your childhood friends, Amu and Noelle and couple of other characters. My very first impressions were mixed. There are multiple endings and routes to them. On my first playthrough, which took roughly 5 hours, I got ending that was way too sweet and happy and felt a bit too perfect, but that is only me. On my second playthrough though, oh boy, was I not prepared for this.\n\nThere is not much to a story, there are no robots, aliens, catgirls ;_;, really, just you and your friends talking and dialog in this game is very well-made, but sometimes it feels like it tries to be way too artistic. It is very character-driven story, so characters better be interesting, right? Are characters here interesting? Yeah, I like all of them, especially Amu. However, the weakest one was deffinitely Noelle. She is quiet, shy and lacks any self-confidence. You can make interesting characters with this concept, but here, she felt kinda one-dimensional. Later on in almost every route revolving around her 80% (number pulled out of nowhere) of every dialog with her turned into her pitying herself, it goes without saying that it got repetetive.\n\nSpeaking of ,,later on", you have to go through a nice amount of filler to get there. It is not unbereable, but once you are trying to get all the endings, you will notice how similiar some dialogs are to others from a completely different route, and this becomes more and more obvious more and more you play.\n\nCharacter sprites are really nice and simple, I like how just by looking at each of them you can guess personality of characters, or simply said, they are very fitting. But there are also backgrounds... yeah. Most of them are ugly. I bet they are just photoshoped versions real-life photos and sometimes it just stands out way too much, just like bad CG in basically every anime ever. Not always, but sometimes. Soundtrack of this game is also not original, songs are made by other people and you can listen to them, if not all of them on Youtube.\n\nNow, you might be asking: ,,Why would I want to get this game? And why are you recommending it?" Answer is very simple. Endings. Some of them are happy, but most of them are dark, very, very dark. One time you can end up happily on your way back home, other time you can get run-over by a train. This game is far from light hearted story, if you want that, go watch Usagi Drop. And while it is a not so spooky you would poop your pants every time you hear opening song, this game it is still quite creepy, and I am even not talking about character sprites when you get to those creepy parts spooky creepy eyes ;-;. These endings were incredibly atmospheric and it was very entertaining reading them. I would give you my favourite example, but that would just ruin the fun ;)\n\nGetting all the endings also feels rewarding, as you unlock new pictures as you play and by getting all endings you unlock *CENSORED, GO AND GET THEM YOURSELF*\n\nOverall, once you slug your way through the boring parts, you get rewarded with extremely well written conclusion just like with Jurasic World. Conclusion? You getting murdered, 10/10, would get murdered again.\n\nTL;DR\nPros:\n+enjoyable characters\n+well written\n+endings\n+nice choice if music (even though not original soundtrack)\n+great character sprites\n+getting all endings feels rewarding\n+able to skip dialog that you have already read\n\nCons:\n-ugly backgrounds\n-filler and a lot of similiar dialogs\n-Noelle is kinda weak of a chracter compared to others\n-you don't get murdered in every ending, me want more gore ;-;\n\nScore: 7,5/10\n\nWith its great atmosphere, enjoyable characters and well-written drama, you sure are going to get a lot of fun out of this, that is when you ignore ugly background and won't bother with filler.","October 7, 2015","true","18.7"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","7","8","0","0"

I like heavily branching plot (though I had to look up for walkthrough to find all the endings). It has enough dark and gory twists, often unexpected - the first ending I got was №2, really didn't see that coming. Another ending that caught me off-guard was №13. And ending 18 is hilarious, in a way. In contrast with all the horror the events can turn to, good endings feel really heartwarming, if sometimes bittersweet. Overall, the story is good and characters are memorable.\nThe game really reminds a bit of Higurashi (to which it has some shout-outs). Interestingly, it also has similar flaws: some scenes feel too long and a bit boring, and the art is mediocre (still better than original Higurashi art, anyway).\nSome things I subjectively disliked: Atcchan is such a doormat, instead of feeling sorry for him in bad endings, I felt some kind of amusement. And Noelle - she is a type of character I usually like and can relate to, thought she was going to be my favorite... then I kept getting bad endings with her and was like "What the hell is wrong with this girl?". Even after I cleared her best route, which explains why she behaves as she is and really made me sorry for her, I just... still don't like her.

(well, maybe not EVERY, but something close to that) you are a shy and a short-heighted guy named Attchan... im not sure how you pronounce his name... i think it is [Athachann] but im not sure... that is going back to a town where he once lived in with both of his closest and best friends Amu and Noelle plus his grandparents lives there. However depending on what choices you make will affect the ending in a lot of different ways... but it really is f***ing hard to get more than "5" different endings in this guy's journey but i guess you will have to make some clever, logic and hard choices you don't even wanna make... I should mention... if reading isn't your thing you will not enjoy this game... because it's a light novel and there are some really long f***ing text  in every dialogue throughout the whole game but i quite enjoy reading books and manga so i like this game... and there are some funny dialogues that makes me laugh sometimes...\n\nWARNING! *SPOILER ALERT* You might be wondering how i found this game... well... i searched "Yandere" when i was gonna look for games and this was the only game that popped up then (a lot of you should already know what a yandere is, if you don't search for it at google)... and when this popped up, i begged my mom to buy it for me, i didn't even bother to try the free demo for the game :/ and luckily me she actually bought it for me. Well enough about me... this game has involved one girl (Noelle) that is really nice, cute and has a strange behavior... just like me :3... but however... later if you make a choice that doesn't involve her in it... she will turn "Lovesick" or as others prefer to call it... "Yandere" and there are some endings when she kills the main character or his friends or blah blah blah whateva... well my point is that this game might or might not contain scenes that may shock you or make you feel very uncomfortable... just like the main character himself in this game, lol. Im just saying that this game is not suitable for over-sensitive humans... but nah... i am a bit over-sensitive myself... so nah, im just speaking random BS or stuff that no-1 cares about... but im trying to warn you before you buy this game... it's scary like a horror game sometimes when the yandere's life in her eyes turn dead and still like stone... and is asking you questions you have to give an crazy and a smart answer to... but then instead you'll give her an answer that she does not approve of and the next thing you see on the screen is your own blood dripping and splatting against you and then the credits comes rolling up...\n\nI will give this game 7,5 out of 10 because i f***ing love the music and the art is cool (in my opinion) and that it is a game with multiple endings... because i like those kinds of games... but this game is kinda short... so i don't like it completely... but after all it's an indie game, reading novel and a story with a hell of a lot of endings like IB, The witch's house and Mad father... which means it has to end sometime... it's not like those open world-games that never ends... but i think you already could have figured that out... and that is all i can say about this game... i apologize for my spelling errors (if i have any) and my bad English but im not from the UK :/","February 21","true","14.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Also, some endings are too similar to eachother.\n\nBut one thing the game does amazingly is the choices. Most of the time, I found myself going crazy tyring to pick one choice over another.

I've so far completed ten of the 21 routes, in 15 hours of gameplay. From this amount of play time, I believe that the price of the game is reasonable for its length. The characters in the game were great because you get a wide range of personalities, some of which are more likeable than others.\n\nHowever, I do believe that this game could've done even better if it had more of a dating simulator aspect to it. There are some romantic moments in some of the routes, but not nearly as much as most of the other dating sim games I've played on Steam. I think this game could've easily been pulled off as a dating sim game, since it had all of the other qualities of dating sims: multiple women, story choices, distinct routes, etc.\n\nDespite this slight disappointment, I still recommend this game to those who enjoy anime visual novels with choices that decide the route you take in the game.","April 10","true","30.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It fits the story and might be creative (not GREAT, but it fits the story and characters; this matters for VNs after all) choice. Once I neared one of the good endings, I started enjoying it. It was almost a fun romance VN. Definitely interesting again.\nI would have said 6/10 perhaps with that ending. Then I started hunting all ends.  Unanswered questions started to be answered and I saw the truth of the VN, the gritty story.\n\nNow I like it alot. 8/10 perhaps. It's definitely fun and I liked it alot. It's not a pure innocent story (not even in the good ending I got on my own). It's definitely SIMILAR to Higurashi but not the same thing. I think it's worth trying out.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/FrontTailPenguin/recommended/352610/","FrontTailPenguin","nin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/FrontTailPenguin/","95 products in account","First things first, it should be emphasized that this is a friendship focused visual novel rather than a romance focused one. While some of the good endings have romance, most of them do not, and Noelle's psychotic obsession over Atcchan is more platonic than outright romantic.\n\nWhile the plot is ultimately mundane, the inter-character drama is captivating and fairly realistic. All of the characters are interesting in their own right, even the minor ones. Even Eri, who appears the least of the three heroines, is a well developed character. However, Noelle is arguably the most developed. Even in the Amu focused and Eri focused routes, Noelle is an important player while Amu is mostly uninvolved in the Noelle route. While there is some outright violence, it's mostly restricted to the bad endings. Be wary of some dark topics nonetheless.\n\nI recommend that you play the endings in order, or if nothing else, play the Comiket route last after doing every other ending. While the game peaks in drama at the Noelle focused route (endings 11-12), the Comiket route does an good job of wrapping up the conflicts and plot points referenced in all of the other routes at once. Sometimes it resolves a conflict off-screen, and sometimes it only off-handedly mentions it , but despite seeming like a gag route and not having a lot of drama, the Comiket route is a satisfying end to the game.\n\nCons:\nSome of the writing is honestly a bit stilted and could use some work. Furthermore, the pacing wasn't stellar. The events in the game span about three days, and much of the first day is fluff. In addition, the sprites aren't the best. Inconsistent CGs are also a minor minus. As I tend to evaluate visual novels on the novel part rather than the visual, I didn't really mind the art style issues though.\n\n7/10 which vaguely means a solid VN; stick on your backlog to play sometime if you're interested.","December 3, 2015","true","11.4"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"
